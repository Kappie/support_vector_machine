I had a Koke earlier, but I've been watching how long they work on me, and if I drink one right when I get in, I burn out about seventh period, so I figure I'll have an hour after the fact, but some of those strange Khinese foods I  always  am probably going to get over there may help...or s'more Koke or something.    Between Times ...I haven't listened to it today...but konsidering that that's all I've got at my dad's house, this weekend is going to be dedikated to Rotting Khrist. There is the komputer, but there's only so mukh you kan do with no internet. Plus, my dad's going to be  gone  on Saturday, he has a date. So I get to sit at home and listen to Rotting Khrist and other sukh tunes and play Unreal and EVO and other sukh games and watkh a kableless TV in a phoneless house. Sounds like a konstant stream of komplains, non? Well, at least, I'm away from the konstantky of my mom's for a few days.  "I think it's gonna raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain, oh, when I diiiiiiiiiiieeee" said Layne Stayley. Yes it is.  Goodbye all, until Sunday.
