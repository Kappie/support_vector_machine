I want to have a party on the 29th because Erica's is on the 30th and mine is the 28th. We could share it. My mum whipped me over 10 times (somewhere around 14 I think) today."  Looking back on that, I have no clue how I could talk about such a happy thing and follow it up with one of the few things that makes me cry. I remember when Dave saw that slip of paper. That was the first time I cried in front of him. How I hate my mother...  Just reading it makes me want to cry again...  Changed the template back to accomodate the new mood icons courtesy of Livejournal. No, the images are not direct-linked, I have them hosted on my photobucket account. All I'm saying is that I didn't make them.   Current Mood:  Depressed
