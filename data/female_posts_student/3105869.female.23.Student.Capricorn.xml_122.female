I have a relative, who is younger than myself, who is marrying this guy that I went out with in 8th or 9th grade. eww. he's nothing special thus that fact he made the "ex-list" but really he's more like, no I won't say the truth, in this case the truth might really hurt. They just sort of last minute told the family although all of his family has flown in town, and they are....drumroll....doing it at the courthouse. Okay so i gotta say it, he reminds me of the type who would comment during a Jerry Springer show, from the live studio audience. No college, no career, no ambition, just generally nothing.     Great and here I am still single, but as proven here, I guess there are slim pickin's.
