I hate heat.  I love winter.  Even my eyelids were sweating today.  Gah.  At least I didn't have graduation practice yesterday, because as hot as it was yesterday, it was even hotter today.  Bleh.  Well anyways, it's my sister's graduation today.  Yay!  I wish it didn't have to be on such a hot day though, considering the graduation is outside.  It can't be as bad as last years though.  It was pouring and they had a four hour power outage.  I would just walk home if that happened.  Yay for living 5 seconds away from Lower Merion!  Yay for Liz graduating!  On a different note, it was soooo random.  When I was getting off the bus, Nikhil Gregg and Bernard (this 7th grader who's been expelled from 3 other schools) tried to give me a high five.  I was like, "What the fuck?" and just got off the bus.  Sooo random.  And I know they were doing it just to annoy me, but still.  Whatever, I hate them anyways.  ONLY FOUR AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu
