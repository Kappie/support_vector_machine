I now have the capicity to upload pictures, so you guys will be able to "see" me wherever I end up. I'm rather excited.  Speaking of "ending up", I will be in Florida tonight! (I promised a cheerful entry didn't I?) I'm going down there to see Scott for a bit. Other than that, I really don't have too much to update on. I've pretty much been chilling out at my apt. with the cat. Roadtrips are always an adventure, so... I'll let you know all about it later!
