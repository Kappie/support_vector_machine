"I Feel So" perfectly sums up exactly what I've been feeling lately, I even think I will share the lyrics with you:  "I Feel So"  Sometimes I wish I was brave I wish I was stronger I wish I could feel no pain I wish I was young  I wish I was shy I wish I was honest I wish I was you not I  'Cause I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, again I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over  Sometimes I wish I was smart I wish I made cures for  How people are I wish I had power I wish I could lead I wish I could change the world  For you and me  'Cause I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, again I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over  'Cause I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, again I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over  I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, again I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over   Today when I was walking into school, I saw the most adorable puppy ever! It was tiny and white with brown spots. AHH it was so cute! I gave Elizabeth two pictures from my digital camera and she looked at them all day, I was glad to make her happy. We moved to our senior seats at announcements, I can't believe it is finally happening! I have to do announcements every day, of course, according to Mr. O'Grady, "Since the seinors aren't here Allison, you'll be doing announcements. But just for this year, next year it's all Steffie, NOT you!" Thanks, like I didn't know that, thanks. In English Sarah P. and Julia did their presentations, mine is tomorrow and I am freaking out. In the middle of Sarah's, Kristen just jumps up and starts screaming. I got really scared that something awful was happening, but she goes, "An ant just fell from my head!" and continued to scream. Everybody was silent, and then we just burst out laughing. Actually, I felt bad, she was really scared. It went on for like two minutes-ahh priceless. Math was kind of boring. Ms. King (Julie-hey now that you're a student no more formal names!) got something wrong, and we all felt bad. I felt bad for Ann too, cause she wanted to make the Student Council announcement this morning because she was  ACTUALLY  at that meeting, but somebody else did it instead. I think Ann would have done a better job anyways. I was kind of mad at Mr. O today. We were talking about how women can't be on submarines, because men can't control themselves and it is not safe for a woman. Since not enough girls want to do that, we're just not allowed. Mr. O kept saying it was human nature etc. No, I'm sorry. The reason why women can't go on a submarine, is beacuse they're down there for three months and men just can't keep it in their damn pants and will rape whatever they can find. That is not human nature. That is disgusting. Everybody should be in control of their own actions, that is not an excuse. It makes me sick. Why can't they just jack off in the corner, that is just bs if you ask me. I complained about it in study hall also. In Chem we watched a movie about batteries, but it makes no sense! EC kept nodding her head, but I was confused. I got my math done fifth period, that was good. We continued working on our Spanish projects, and EC and I finished finding all the pictures for our quotes. Before chapel I was harassing Ann about her brother, yet again! I am so sorry, but it's too fun to tease her. I was going on about how she promised we could be friends this summer, and Doc goes, "Who do you want to be friends with?" And I said Ann and he asked why and I said, "Because she has a hot brother!" AND he was shocked! Sorry Ann. I could not stay awake in chapel, once those lights come down the eyelids close up. I had lab and it was hard. Doc kept going on and on. He said something like "Allison Ansari I hope your grade is going far-y" OOH DOC. Then he goes, "The AP Chem kids missed a 20-point problem on their test that I know you could have done!" And I go, "Well, they talk a big game, but they can't walk the walk of Doc". I don't know, Sammy laughed. Hey, I respect AP Chem kids though, don't get me wrong. But my class is an AP in itself- It's DOC for God's sake! But if I don't have Doc next year I'll cry! The afternoon was really not good. I left school and had to turn around. Dr. D was supposed to copy my handout but I never picked them up. I couldn't find him, but eventually saw him in Pryor's room. He was like, "Why didn't you just get them tomorrow?" And I told him I wanted to staple them, but they had already been stapled. So I just left them in his room. Then I went to the library, pulled into the parking lot, and remembered I didn't have my library card. So I went home and watched an old Buffy on TV. It was such a good one, but then I cried cause it was the one where Riley said that Buffy didn't love him. OH GOD I LOVE YOU RILEY FINN. Well, I have two projects due tomorrow, kill me, thanks bye bye jar jar.
