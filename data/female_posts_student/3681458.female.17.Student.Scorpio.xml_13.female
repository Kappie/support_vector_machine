When you held my hand in the car, but had to switch gears every five minutes 5.) The way you say I love you like 50 times in a row, b/c you know it makes me have butterflies 6.) Your unpredictableness 7.) Your hot temper that is completely sexy. 8.) The way you always close your eyes when you kiss me. 9.) The warmth and comfort of your embrace. 10.) The way you wipe my eyes of their tears.
