We decided against that one anyway, I think, just cuz it's sounds like a grindcore name, and for those of you that don't know, grindcore sort of sucks.  I'm about to try the new tea, I've waited all day. I really don't know about powder-based green tea, but hell, anything's worth a shot, as long as you don't bleed very badly thereafter.  Pariah is an Indian word coming from the caste system and whatnot; it means something to the effect of "ruffage". Pretty much, it's the lowest rung of the ladder in society, you're crap, you're nobody, you're worse than a slave, you nothing more than a breathing sack of organic compounds. The M-W definition is: 1 : a member of a low caste of southern India 2 : outcast, altho we've found that it's a much stronger word in context. It comes from Tamil, and the translation is "drummer," which makes NO sense. Or maybe it does. Now we see why everyone hates the drummers in bands so much?  That colon means you've been being hypnotized by Kelly too much. Take the day off tomorrow. Stupid Socratic seminar. How about those of us who don't like to be useful in class, or fear saying something stupid so they hardly say anything when they can help it? Stupid Kelly, stupid. The lady is the most even-tempered and agreeable person, but honestly, someone needs to drag her ambitions of being a good teacher to pasture and have them shot. Aie.  Tea time! Have a good day off tomorrow, dudes. Yes, you heard me. Well, some of us (sorry Abby!), perhaps (never give up the hope, etc.). I'm going to do the Snow Dance right now, and damned if it isn't going to be painful. Arrivederci.
