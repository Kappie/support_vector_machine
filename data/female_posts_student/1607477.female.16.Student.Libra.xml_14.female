Billy came out of no where tonight and said he didnt want a relationship with me but im a really great girl. i was like ok? it was kinda weird but ive realized God is real. He does answer prayers. i kinda already knew he did. but i dont know i wanted him to prove to me that he is real. and he is.  i prayed for a peace about sunny and billy and for him to just got ahead and let me know that Billy wasnt for me. and he did that tonight i mean i wasnt expecting it this soon since i just prayed about it last night. im kinda bummed about the whole thing but i knew it was comming, plus its for the best ya never know maybe God will use Billy in my life in another way. i dont know. things are kinda hectic with me right now.  i asked god to send me someone for the time being maybe even the perfect someone. and its kinda strange coz i went out with addison last night and had so much fun. i dont know what to do im kinda lost at the moment. but now i know all i gotta do is pray about it and God will answer my prayers.. rather it be in a month a year a day or 5 minutes. im still trying to figure out the whole saying" some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers" I dont think im at that point of understanding. well readers its been nice letting yall know inside my head. have a good night and God bless. and if you have a problem talk to the big man upstairs he is always listening, and leah.. ill keep robert in my prayers. good night all.  Lindsay
