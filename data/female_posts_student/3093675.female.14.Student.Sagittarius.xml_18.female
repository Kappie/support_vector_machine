(the southerner in me, lol) it gone done inspired me to write about last thursday.  So there was a mock car crash at my school, right? of course right. And afterwards we went to the gym to hear these people talk- all of them had sons (one was a friend of one of the sons) who died in drunk driving accidents all within 11 days and 25 miles of eachother. My aunt Maura died in a drunk driving crash also. I felt like such a mean person for only crying for about 5 minutes total when the moms were talking. I had that crying feeling in my stomach, but not many tears. Anyways, here's that poem that my teacher read. It seems insanely cheesy, but it's really true.    "The Dash" I read of a man who stood to speak at the funeral of a friend. He referred to the dates on her tombstone from the beginning...to the end.  He noted that first came the date of her birth and spoke of the following date with tears, but he said what mattered most of all was the dash between those years.  For that dash represents all the time that she spent alive on earth... and now only those who loved her know what that little line is worth.  For it matters not, how much we own; the cars....the house...the cash. What matters is how we live and love and how we spend our dash.  So think about this long and hard... are there things you'd like to change? For you never know how much time is left. (You could be at "dash mid-range.")  If we could just slow down enough to consider what's true and real, and always try to understand the way other people feel.  And be less quick to anger, and show appreciation more and love the people in our lives like we've never loved before.  If we treat each other with respect, and more often wear a smile... remembering that this special dash might only last a little while.  So, when your eulogy's being read with your life's actions to rehash... would you be proud of the things they say about how you spend your dash?
