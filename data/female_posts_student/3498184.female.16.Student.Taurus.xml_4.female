The swimming one was filling out a reflection sheet and answering questions like "What grade to you think you diserve in this class? NAME THREE REASONS NOW BIATCH!" and "how will this physical education class help you in everyday life" It was so boring. After that, Em, Jesse, Amber and I chilled outside. It was still hella boring. My history final wasn't as easy, I don't think I did too bad on it. I'm thinking A-, B+ or B range. WOO! It took me 2Â½ hours to make that note card, but I used it. lol, after the final I screwed around with the camera. I LOVE PICTURES! Tomorrow I have my Creative Writing and Math final. I HOPE I DO GOOD! For the creative writing one, we have to match a bunch of terms, but we have to write a story. The writing a story on the spot is gonna be hard. MATH! Oh math, that's gonna be a silly final. I'm not really lookin forward to that one. OH well, gotta do it.  I should start studying...i used my early release well. Well, the viking tasted good so hey what are ya gonna do? LATERz  ~Bayz
