I will not make any rude and nasty comments about Kobe and the freakin' Lakers tonight.  Having the Pistons beat them  100-87  is good enough for me.  Basketball is over, now I can concentrate on the Cubbies.  They won again tonight by the way.  Movin' on up!  Down 2 games. It's still a little early to be worried about series position, so I won't have that competition edge to me for a few weeks.  Although Wimbledon starts Monday.  Woooooo. No.  No matter how hot Andy Roddick is, I wont go there.
