Violent jerk  to the left right pushes me over, lose my balance scared, trapped, canâ€™t breathe.  falling into the sea, succumbing to the shuffle of feet the wailing and howling, a kick in the head the ground. The oceanic mass dragging  me along the vacuum of a thousand singers, players, best friends eyes close hope for the best.     ---   It's always amazed me how 'mosh politics' work. People you'd never associate with on a daily basis become your best "OH MY GOD! THEY'RE PLAYING MY SONG" buddies (cue above photo - do you think I'd normally be great buddies with the scary bald man who proceeded to spill bourbon all over me?), and the scene above  becomes euphoria instead of fear and anguish. So many times I've let myself get trampled on  hit punched crowd surfed on and enjoyed it. It's a rush, and, no less, it's not as fun  without the bruises.   The crowd becomes one vast oceanic mass, where no one knows anything about you except perhaps your taste in music...or your desire to get beaten up by a crowd surfer  wearing boots .  Maybe the thrill is that anonymity, your ability to escape  reality.  No one cares if you're failing school, your best friend hates you, you got fired. You're just another fan in the sea of wannabe stage divers.  Or maybe the thrill is the knowledge that if you fall, you'll always be saved by some huge hairy bloke holding a can of bourbon  coke.  But why can't this intense sense of community exist in other walks of life? The world would be full of much happier (albeit black and blue) people.  That old woman who snarled at me on the bus this morning would be  happy  that the bus jerked and I invaded her personal space. Four young people wouldn't  have  to stand up just because one old man needs a seat..they could all share in bruisng glory.  'Personal Space' doesn't exist in mosh pits, except in the form of spiked accessories and protective boyfriends, and the sweaty shirtless men no one wants to go near.  And thank God for that.  For now, though, I think I'll stick to a world where personal space and ettiquette exist..it scares me to think that one day I could be on a bus, squished against the chest of a bald, sweaty man  holding a can of bourbon  coke.
