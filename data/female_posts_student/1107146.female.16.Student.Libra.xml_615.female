You can get me upset really easily by insulting someone/something that is important to Abby.  Third, Rosie, you're right, you haven't antagonized me lately and I 'm grateful.  Abby also knows about that if that's what this whole thing is about.  But Josh was there last year when I was with Michael, and was really good about supporting me then, through the whole breakup, and is he isn't insulting me now (Thanks, Josh, that's really meant a lot.)  Will too, though he doesn't know all the drawn out details, cause I don't get to talk to him much, and when I do it's about math most of the time.  Fourth, Rosie, you don't know Abby either, and I can recall you saying some stuff about her before, whether good or bad.  Yall just need to stop all contact, it seems.  Fifth, no, Abby's not a big fan of yours Rosie, and I've told you for a while to watch your step.  But the way to fix it is not to insult her and not apologize for previously insulting her.  Please don't try to fix anything when it comes to Abby.  Leave that to me (and josh) and let it go.  When Abby gets mad, I advise you to run, especially if she's mad on the behalf of me (or josh), which she is.  She will not forgive you as easily for what you said to me about Michael than if you had said something to Josh about her, because you're insulting me not her.  Some holds true for me.    And as for you and Josh, just stop cussing each other out NOW and talk it out, cause it's only going to go down hill from here, if history is about to repeat itself.  Josh probably shouldn't have called you an ass, true, but you're going a bit too far.
