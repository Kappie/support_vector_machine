I can spend hours on the first 95% of something and its perfect, but the last 5% I shove off and complete it haphazardly and it ruins the entire thing (sorry Hannah!).  So I had to finish that stupid apes project and it just wouldn't end.  First we had to add extra bubbles and glue everything down.  Then I had to hole punch the pages so that it could be bound. Then the pages didn't lay straight because of the foam, so I had to add foam spacers.  Then the spacers didn't look right.  Then a page was in backwards and so on.  So I threw the stupid thing in the corner and its done. This is the same scenario for everything I do.  I clean my room and everything is organized except for 15 miscellaneous items, which get thrown into a pile to deal with later, then they fall down etc. etc. I am done ranting...Sorry you had to read all that.
