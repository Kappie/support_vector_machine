I've been with this girl for 10 hours now...WOOHOO!!  Fun ones of course.  Unfort. we won't get too much more time cuz i gotta work tomorrow from 12-6.  Two good things about that tho--its a swim meet day [HOT GUYS and no cashing out] and money of course.    I'm surprised that you've never been told before That you're lovely and you're perfect And that somebody wants you
