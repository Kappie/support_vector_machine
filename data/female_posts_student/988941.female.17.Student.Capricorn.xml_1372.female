So in a way i am happy, but its alot of work. Anyway, i got up really later yesterday and did media, then Becky (the gf) took me out for a candlelit meal for my birthday, she brought me Hugo Boss aftershave (the new and improved david now more irrasistable than ever before) so that is nice. and she brought me a big glittery card, also her parents brought me a card (From them) (is that strange???) so i got home at 00:30 this morning and slept for a while, up nice and early to do this media, am now having a short break, and a BBQ in a bit. Then back to work. I hope your all well, and we will do something soon, i am thinking i wanna take people bowling next weekend, maybe sunday. what do we think? good idea? Anyway work to be done, speak to you all soon, Good luck tom, Dave
