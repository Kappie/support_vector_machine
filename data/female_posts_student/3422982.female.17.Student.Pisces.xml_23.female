Just as I'm walking out of the bathroom, the doorbell rings.  Great timing on my part.  Go me!  We went out to eat, then to the mall... then out to eat again heh.  Good times.  I got myself and Rachel a lighter.  Mine says, "I tried sniffing coke once, but the ice cubes got stuck up my nose."  And Rachel's says, "Aunt Em, fuck you and fuck Kansas, I'm taking the dog, Dorothy."  Weee!!  I found out today that I'm going to Kansas to see her for her birthday.  I'll be a day late though because we have to take Cody to the airport on the third.  Oh well.  I still get to go out there.  I need to call my mom soon and give her an update on how things have been going.  hmm... Well I can't really think when I'm trying to be quick.  So I'll probably be back later with a rant, cuz Dad pissed me off today.   later dayz
