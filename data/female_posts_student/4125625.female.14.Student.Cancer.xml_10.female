((Ben Miller, that is)) for this thing, idk but some other parents were there ((from my church)) and like Rob, Wes, Landon, Grant, Ben, Elizabeth, Sean, Grant, and Grant were there too, but uhh yea it was cool..then most of us went over to The Box for a prayer  worship time with just the youth...((we've been doing this for a few weeks now...ever since we got back from Mission Trip..which was amazing by the way )) but yea, and a TON of people were there, not usual for this, but it was so amazing!!! And well after we were done Marshall was like okay can i see the Grapeviners, and so well since i am now a 'Freshman' at my church as of Sunday morning..lol i could go..lol...but well Marshall had a really cool idea about going up to the Highschool and having a prayer and worship thing the day before school starts..but then someone reminded him that we had our 'Back to School Bash' that day at night..so we couldnt do it then..and well so we moved it to Saturday, the 14th! which works perfect..lol!!
