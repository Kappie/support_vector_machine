It's a drag waking up on Wednesday and Friday mornings, because something in the back of my head keeps prompting me about the long day ahead. I'll be spending the next 9 hours confinedto the walls of my classroom, either because of the extra lessons or the endless mock tests week after week, only to make it home just in time to lay the dinner table.It's supposed to havebecome a routine already, but I still dread it. The monotonous droning of the teachers' voices puts me to sleep even quicker thangeneral anesthesia.    Mondays are equally bad because you canfeel the whole week's activitieswaiting to jump at you and swallow you whole the moment you step out of your house door and board the bus which takes you on the slow rideto 2 Linden Drive. Kinda like the roller coastercranking its way up to the highest peak and then releasing all brakes, plunging you into the depths of who-knows-where at a thousand miles per hour.    It is relief getting out of bed on Tuesday morningsbecause you know there're no more long band practicesto make sure that you're one of the last few to rush out of the school gates just before the security aunty slams it shut with a bolt and lock.   To top it all off, you don't know the sheer delight of waking up on Saturday mornings after sleeping for as long as you like and smiling to yourself because you can do the same thing the next morning, without worrying if you're going to run down in time to catch the school bus, or if you packed the wrong timetable.    But this is not going to happen this week though. I have to be in school by 7:40am tomorrow for the Literature Symposium with TCHS, CHIJ andSCGS. Damn, I hope you have a good night's sleep.
