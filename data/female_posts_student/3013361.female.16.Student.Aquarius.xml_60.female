Some background info: I'm afraid of the animals that are dead and have been stuffed. Like the kind that hunters have on their walls. Just so happens Alex's Dad has a squirrel stuffed and hanging on their wall.  The Story: It was a week ago, I think it was June 28th, a Monday. Anyway, Alex wanted out of swim practice so we arranged for us and Brent and Drew to go see Dodgeball. Well, after the movie we decided to head back to Alex's house for some video games and air hockey. Well, while chilling in her basement somehow Brent and Drew found out I'm afraid of "The Squirrel" Well, that's where chaos ensued. Drew would pop up behind chairs, from around corners with "The Squirrel" and me being the chicken I am would scream in terror and they would all laugh hysterically. Well, it was time for me to go so I was sitting "the tank" about to call my mom to tell her where I was. Since it is known by all that I have the best luck imaginable my mom picks up the phone the instant that Drew sets the dead, stuffed, nasty squirrel on my lap. My mother picks up the phone to hear hysterical crying, etc. She thinks I'm in an accident, and I'm flipping out cuz the thing I hate most is on my lap! Drew, Alex, and Brent are standing in Alex's driveway laughing their heads off as I'm screaming and trying to explain to my mom what's going on. My mother tells me to calm down and just get home. She said this in a rather mean and irritated way. When I got home I got a 20 minute lecture on how I shouldn't scare my mom like that and how it was irresponsible of my friends to act like that. But now, looking back, it really was funny. Although I am sick of getting im'd pictures of squirrels. Luv ya guys!
