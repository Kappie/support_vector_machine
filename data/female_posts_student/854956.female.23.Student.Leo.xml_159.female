Tuesday was the first day back since the break, and it was nice to see all the kids.  I must've gotten about 50+ hugs that first day because they were all so glad to see us again.  I heard all about Christmas and the presents they received.  The only bad part about the first day was that the kids were stir-crazy because they didn't have recess during school OR at A.S.K. (it was too cold).  Yesterday was even better... we got to take the kids out for about 20 minutes... only bad part about yesterday was that since it's the new year, Chess Club started up again... which means that we get stuck in the gym for the first hour of A.S.K.  BLAH!  That sucks!  I hate having the kids in there because they have the room to run around... and then they do... and then they get in trouble.  In addition to that, they get really loud... and as we all know from our elementary school days... when it gets loud in a gym, the only thing you can hear is a whistle... and we can't use whistles.  So, we have to yell extra loud so they can hear us.    This is just part of it, though.  It may sound like I hate my job, but I actually love it.  This is the first time I've been "sick" at work... and THAT'S why I sound extra peeved about stuff... I have less patience when I'm feeling like my head is going to implode... and I can't reach it to detonate the bomb because it feels like it's floating way above my body.  Doesn't it sound like fun?  Well, I must jet now... I have to finish getting ready for work.  I just felt like updating... especially after seeing someone from Germany visited my blog!  :-)  WOOHOO!
