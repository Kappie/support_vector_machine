I'm not sure if anyone is out there reading this, especially given my month hiatus while I was in Montenegro, but I suppose I do it more for myself than anything else, so I'll keep posting.  I am in Israel.  It's really nice here.  Sunny, beautiful weather, green everywhere, lots of flowers and cats, a lab full of stuff to do.  There's just one thing missing.  No, not my sanity.  My luggage.  Which is hopefully either already in London or on its way there.  It got left behind in Newark, which stinks.  But I barely made my trans-Atlantic flight myself.  The luggage counter girl in Heathrow said I should be glad I at least made it, but if I had missed the flight, I would not have been separated from my luggage and they would have had to put me and it together on a later flight.   Ah well.  I know I am overly attached to my stuff sometimes, but I don't have that much, and my bags had all my new, fancy camping gear in them, and also had my favorite summer clothes/shoes.    Anyhoo, hours 1-5 of Israel are shaping up to be WAY better than all of Montenegro.  I got food, new very unstyling clothing (1 set and PJs), a tour of the lab, and given the seat of honor at the computer.  Sweet.  What more could a girl ask for?  Well, besides a great big hug and kiss from Matt.  :(((((  OK, maybe time to nap?
