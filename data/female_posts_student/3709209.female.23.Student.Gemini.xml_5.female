(K, this is a bit extreme, soooo we've taken a random poll and decided that you can talk about hushchild)  3rd rule: If someone says "stop" or goes limp, taps out, HUSHCHILD is over.  4th rule: Minimum two guys to a fight.  5th rule: One HUSHCHILD at a time.  6th rule: No shirts, no shoes.  7th rule: HUSHCHILD will go on as long as they have to.  8th rule: If this is your first night at HUSHCHILD, you HAVE to post.  So, choose a pseudonym, put up your dukes, and come out full mouthed...
