Depressed, and sad, scared and little. now who keeps saying we're perfect for each other, don't we both know this? I'm so confused. you and nate arent getting along still huh? yea well, i like to apologize to fix things and stuff, so thats what i did.   *the angel opens her eyes, pale-blue colored eyes.*  on tuesday, if you wouldnt have been in the car, i was planning on running it into a tree. It seemed logical at the time.   fucking end this shit. i hate life. but not enough i suppose.  right. so anyway. Come away with me. fucking a!
