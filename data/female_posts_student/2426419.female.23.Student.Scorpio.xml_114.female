Why doesn't Chris go back to her when he hears she is alive in Bangkok? Why didn't he love her enough to keep searching and waiting? There seems to be this running theme in my life . . . well okay, the movies I'm watching . . . like Cast Away. I caught the end of that tonight. Helen Hunt doesn't go back to Tom Hanks. And what did I see before that? Oh, Under the Tuscan Sun. It makes me sad. I almost felt like crying when Tom showed up at Helen's door. I cried out in silence, "Tom, I would have taken you back. I would have not even had to think twice." What is all this crazy business about moving on, eh?   Today, my throat got worse. Please pray for a happy throat. But I still took Tiff (my cousin) to lazer tag, since i promised her that i would. Dude, that is the coolest ever. It's like we were actually in a video game. And there's just something exhilerating about looking out for cover and creeping up on people to shoot them with that laser gun. The room is dark, slightly lit by colored lights and the glowy paint splattered across the walls and all the levels. Then we stuck around for awhile to play air hockey and a few arcade games. I could spend my whole life playing laser tag and air hockey! In our second game, there were about 28 people in the room. I made about 1049 points and ranked 10! I rock. Um, of course, I was probably about 7 years older and at least one foot taller than most of the kids, but we don't have to dwell on that, right?
