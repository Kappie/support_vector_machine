As always, my birthday fell in the calendar vicinity of Memorial Day, so one of my first birthday gifts this year was a three-day weekend. But, seeing as how the school year ended and I haven't really started work yet, having an extra day added to the weekend didn't really stir up the usual feelings.   For various reasons, I decided to spend my birthday in Boston:   (1) Since the school year ended, most of my med school friends took off running for the hills and have gone away for the summer. And, those who decided to rough it in NYC for the summer were, for the most part, spending the holiday weekend with family or taking a mini-break. So, there wasn't anyone in NYC to celebrate my birthday with. (2) I've been missing my Boston friends (phoq-all!) and the good old times we used to have in Cambridge and Boston proper, so I thought that if my friends were free, Boston would be the best place to celebrate. Also, several of my friends are graduating and moving onto the next phase of their lives, so, sad as it is to think about it this way, this would probably be the last time I'd see all of my friends together in one big happy group. Thankfully, phoq-all was free for the weekend, so I was able to haul up to Boston knowing that I would be able to celebrate with friends.  (3) Apparently, months ago when Garth was signing up for shifts at work, he hadn't fully realized that my birthday was this particular weekend in May. As a result, he signed up to work ridiculous hours this weekend. So, he couldn't come out to NYC to spend my birthday weekend with me. Since I wanted to spend at least part of my birthday with him, it further cemented my decision to go to Boston.  Rather than give the full play-by-play of my birthday, because I don't want to bore readers and, more importantly, myself, I'll just give people some major highlights:   Friday:  * Opting for a new travel experience, Greyhound, after finding out, to my dismay, that the Chinatown buses and Amtrak were ridiculously sold out this weekend. For some random ass reason, it totally escaped my mind that traveling would be a bitch this weekend since it was Memorial Day weekend. * Braving holiday travelers and traffic with a bus driver who (1) bitched at me when I asked how long the trip would be, (2) stopped on the side of the highway so he could take a piss in the bus's bathroom, and (3) made a random ass stop in Framingham to drop off passengers. * Fighting the urge to buy a McFlurry while waiting for the 10:40PM commuter rail in South Station. Note: I arrived at South Station at 8:30PM, but had to wait for this particular commuter rail train since Garth wouldn't be able to pick me up at Kingston until after 11.  * Having Garth hand me his birthday present for me when the clock struck midnight and it was officially my birthday. He got me an IPOD! 15.0 GB, mind you. And it was wrapped all pretty-like with white paper and a big pink bow.    Saturday:  * Roughing another commuter rail ride back out to Boston. Honestly, I'm getting to be such a frequent commuter rail traveler, it's ridiculous.  * Having to buy new shoes. Being the brilliant packer that I am, I forgot to bring shoes that would match my outfit. So, rather than spend the entire day wearing my black/pink New Balance sneakers, I hauled over to The Tannery, a store in Harvard Square that has fabulous, but expensive shoes. I headed straight for their Camper collection and saw an adorable pair of Twins. Despite their ridiculous cost (though, I did talk the price down), I purchased them. Well, I needed shoes and it was birthday, so I felt that it was okay to splurge. * Meeting up with the crew (phoq-all) at ABP in Kendall Square. Ahh, ABP. The memories. Anyways, after the initial double take at seeing Lee, Adrian, Kitty, and Hubert driving up in Lee's Ford Focus, I hopped into the car with them. Where were we going? Andover, the location of Lee's former high school, Phillips Academy at Andover. Yes, that Andover. The one where GW went to school. Let me just say that Andover puts my high school and probably a lot of other high schools to shame. After a brief stop at a restaurant that can only be described as an upscale Denny's, we wandered around Andoover's sprawling campus.  * Getting one of the fortune cookie invitations that Adrian cooked up (haha, I'm so punny) for my birthday party. There were two huge fortune cookies with a cute "fortune" inside. Major props to Adrian for organizing a fantastic birthday celebration! I've definitely missed celebrating birthdays with the phoq-all gang.  * Realizing that we had reservations at the Boston Fire and Ice at 6:30PM and that we had to haul ass back to Boston if we wanted to meet up with Justin and Xian and make our reservations. But, of course, we had time to stop at McDonald's for a chocolate sundae (dollar menu, baby).  * Buying a $3 box of bandages at Shaw's so that (1) we could get our Prudential Center parking lot ticket validated and (2) so I could relieve the pain that comes with breaking in new shoes.  * Having a kickass birthday dinner at Fire and Ice. Delicious food and awesome company. After totally pigging out on the various offering at Fire and Ice, we all attempted to finish off the Ice Bowl (serves 2-4) that I had ordered. Since our attempt was lame and weak, we decided to liven the experience up by starting a game of "Never have I ever," which let me just say was an eye-opening experience. Not only did we finish off the Ice Bowl, but I also learned a lot of new things about my friends and confirmed my suspicions that I am ridiculously unpure. * Having to find "open" bathrooms in the Pru. After drinking my (small) portion of the Ice Bowl, I drank a crazy amount of water, so that I wouldn't get sick. I had an hour-long commuter rail ride ahead of me and there was no way that I wanted to get sick on the commuter rail. I probably drove everybody nuts with having to go to the bathroom every five minutes. Okay, that's an exaggeration. * Stopping off at Krispy Kreme's. Okay, so I am so glad that Krispy Kreme's set up shop at the Pru after I graduated and moved away from Boston. If I still lived in Boston, I would seriously be there all the time. It's already hard enough having to walk by the carts selling mediocre pastries and donuts on West 168th Street. How could I say no to Krispy Kreme's?! * Getting birthday wishes and love in the forms of phone calls and e-mails from various family members and friends. If you called and/or e-mailed me, THANK YOU! * Eating yummy birthday cake. When I got back to Kingston, Garth surprised me with birthday cake! He had been talking about getting me birthday cake the night before, but I figured he'd be so busy with work that he wouldn't get a chance to get the cake. The cake was delicious!  * Deciding to go back to New York City the next day since (1) I was too tired to think of anything to do (and make the necessary phone calls to make plans) to keep myself busy until Garth got out of work and (2) traffic would be horrendous on Monday.   Sunday:  * Taking the my last commuter rail ride of the weekend. Due to extreme exhaustion, I promptly fell asleep in my seat. Hopefully, I didn't scare anyone. I must have looked like hell. * Getting reasonably-timed tickets for the Fung Wah Bus back to New York. Despite getting to Chinatown at 10:15AM, I was able to snag a 11:30AM ticket back to New York. This was particularly stellar since I figured everyone and their mother, like me, would be trying to beat Monday traffic by leaving on Sunday. * Making it back to New York City in three and half hours. Thank you crazy Chinatown bus driver. I honestly don't know how they can make the trip in three and a half hours. It's insane. Again,I promptly fell asleep in my seat and was, for the most, asleep for the entire ride back to NYC. I defintely bothered the guy sitting next to me. But, hey, it's not like he didn't bug me. Dude, I'm sorry if you're tall and big and the seats aren't that comfortable for you, but, really, you don't need to invade my space. Seriously.  Okay, that's it. Sorry if I've bored you. But, if you've made it this far, I must have kept your interest. Somehow. But, anyways, another birthday, another year older. :)
