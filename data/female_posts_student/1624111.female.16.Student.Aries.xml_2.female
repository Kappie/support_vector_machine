I figured i could have fun with this over the summer...like a little piece of my mind for everyone to read if they get that bored. Okay, so, i just wrote a subjournal on my profile (which is starting to bore me, anyway) and i didnt like it cause it was mean and only let me ramble for 3000 characters (which goes quickly if youre me) and i didnt like it too much, so this is my frist "blog" or whatever. (why is it even called a blog? what a funny name...maybe its a combo word...like smog...something that starts in bl and somethign that ends in og...thing about it. or maybe just something that starts with b and the word log...cause this certainly is logish.) and after i finish this introductiony thing, ill copy my subjournal into one instead and put a link on my profile. enjoy.
