In the midst of swatching, I'm loitering around the Knitty board and  urlLink another finished Cleo  makes me think... that might be fun.  No.  Nooo.  I don't need another thing on the to-do list.  So why not do something shorter?  Like the bra part?  Looking at  urlLink Petit Chou  I think, that won't be much knitting.  I can draw out my own size, make what shape I want, and do some lace-ish pattern which actually looks nice.  It won't be a long project.  I can always frog.  (But where's the fun in a project you can't show off?)  No, I have enough I want to do!  Another tank and a  little  felted bag and finish the bag I've got going... that's not so much.  Fine.  As soon as I finish this row of this swatch I'll go fetch different yarn and... do another swatch.    Actually I haven't started the next felted thing.  It's just high on my list.  Maybe I should put the yarn where I can't find it.    It's near 1 AM and these may be overcaffeinated ramblings again.     9 AM edit - Finished already!  It's a halter neck, I guess.  Used Cotton Fixation and knit the whole thing in garter stitch.  For a first freehanded attempt it came out decent.  The cup/triangle thingies came out a bit too small, though.  No, I will not post a picture of me wearing it.  Now I have an excuse to knit Cleo - have something to wear under it.  (I told me, I have enough to do!!)    Entertaining diversion.  I didn't expect me to do this.   Edit #2 -  urlLink Picture(s)   .
