It was nothing over the top, nothing crazy, just an absolutely amazing night spent with amazing, wonderful people.  My boyfriend and his roomates were super awesome and lent me their house to host my party.  My local group of people showed up for the festivities shortly after 8, we ate some dinner and then we started drinking.  As the night wore on more friends from high school who I hadn't seen in about a year showed up and that was also cool.  My brother, his girl, their friend and my cousin also showed up along with 2 other friends from New York.   Once everyone was here and had played enough Kings, Asshole or "forestry" to get good and "happy" my boyfriend (who is quite possibly the best most incredible guy in the world (and now its been proven)) gave me the first of many awesome surprises.  He got everyone together and they sang happy birthday to me and he had Ice cream cake (my favoritest!) and all these candles.  I'll have a birthday photo album up so y'all can check it out, but I want to wait for tonight to be over first.  It was so great, I felt like when you're a lil kid in school and you get to bring in cupcakes and all the kids in your class sing to you.  Since I'm a summer baby I never got to do that, so this was awesome and so so fun (c:  It almost made me cry thats how great it was.  Also, this year, none of the cake or whipped cream ended up in my face in front of a bar full of people, so that was swell.  After the first party crowd dispersed around midnight my brother, Katy, my cousin and Andrew chilled for a while until about 1:30 when the second party started.  Todd, his roomate, and Bex and Vicki came home with 2 guys from their hockey team.  The very accurately named "Animated Kevin" and Fabs.  More hilarity ensued.  I had been partying since 8 though, so I called it a night around 3, my brother left around 2:30 and the rest of the party went til about 7 or 8 in the a.m.  Nice!  Saturday morning Andrew gave me my birthday present.  I'm now one step closer to full on mac geek-dom and the proud owner of a bright, shiny new, totally excellent: iPod!  Yayayayayayay!  He's not just awesome for buying such a kick ass present, but it didn't hurt his cause.  I snoozed around the house and then Bex and I headed out to PNC Bank Arts Center to see The GetUp Kids *my faves but we got there too late and missed 'em*, Thrice and Dashboard Confessional.  I have to say I'm not the hugest Dashboard fan, but seeing them and getting to hear more than just "Screaming Infidelities" made me defintiley start to dig 'em.  We had a random run-in with Twan on the way home, Bex was accosted by some drunk wierdo who wanted Burger King and we sang Diana Ross and much other cheezy music in the car on the ride home.    Sunday I got all girlified with my mommy and we went and got manicures and pedicures then to the mall to pick out some presents and eat some chinese food.  Not too shabby.  I'm not sure when I'll acutally be getting the pressies from my mom, but not to worry.   I ended up at Chez Megan (home of tonight's totally awesome pool party) to look at pictures with Bex, Josh and Andrew and then we went out to Boston Market for some yummy eats.  Came home, Bex, Todd Andrew and I found a new addiction:  the Surreal Life.  Holy what a crock of crap, but its a train wreck so you have to watch.  Here we are, Monday moring.  My acutal birthday.  Andrew woke me up with Dunkin Donuts Iced French Vanilla Coffee and a Strawberry frosted donut my favoritest breakfast (see what I mean about how thoughtful and amazingly awesome he is) and Bex and I are going to head to the beach later, then out to delicious birthday dinner at FISH and then the lovely Megs is hosting my "proper" birthday bash.  This is seriously the best weekend of my entire life.  I want to thank everyone who participated for just being so awesome and so fun and such good friends.  You're all amazing people and I love you all and I'm looking forward to this next year with you.     urlLink Look, I even still get RonFez.Net Birthday Threads!!!
