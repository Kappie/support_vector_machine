I like your attidude , you ae kind, funny and your not a snob, I als othink you are physically attractive.  Uhhhg.. ain't that weird?  I seriously don't know why anyone would like ME.  I'm an ass if I do say so myself.  Oh  well.  He can like me all he wants but that doesn't mean he'll get me.  *Smirks*.
