I had then so bad when i was a baby i almost didnt make it. They SUCK! Ive already gone through like half a gallon of cranberry juice in like an hour. The whole week was pretty good tho. i got to go shopping agian and get some stuff for my trip. Watched the finale of Friends last night and it turned out just as i had hoped,cant say the same thing for The OC but whatever! lol Jeanette and i tried tanning out on the trampoline on tuesday and it was so nice for like 20 minutes unitll the wind came out and it got REALLY cold. We also died my hair,we got bored and put bright red streaks in it, but of course i have blonde hair and after i washed it they turned orange! GREAT! so now im walking around looking like a mupet.They canceled Days of Our Lives today b/c of some stupid presidential thing,that really ticked me off,it was the one good thing i had going in my day and it was canceled. I also watched Tuck Everlasting for the first time after owning it for almost a yr, and  I really liked it up untill the end when she dies and dosent drink from the spring.Now okay, if you had the choice to drink from a spring that can give your everlasting life would you turn it down? NO!!! Okay ive rambled on enough. Have a great weekend! Kayla
