But I really like their music, although it took me some time to start to like them. I do still have some trouble with the lyrics... Especially reading them without laughing ;) But I've always liked their concept and been proud, since they ARE after all from Finland. And they were the first ones to do such a thing, to play epic opera-heavymetal. After that came Within Temptation etc. The singer of the band is a trained opera singer, a soprano. Her voice is really beautiful. The band plays hard melodic heavy metal, with a story on every CD. I once saw them live in Tampere, my hometown, it was probably winter 2000/2001 or something like that. It was ok, since it was a dvd-gig ;) I checked it, the gig was in winter 2000 (December) since the dvd was published 2001. But we spent the whole concert with my buddies in the bar area and played air guitar ;) Well, Nightwish keeps on making music and they're doing well. The singer married a record company chef from Argentina last year and has been studying more singing, for example in Germany.  Hmm, so what's been going on...  Christmas is over and it was ok. On Christmas Eve I had a hard time. I was in stress, homesick etc. I felt horrible and cried a lot and didn't have any trace of Christmas feeling. Thank god Rico was there to comfort me. The next day was much better and we had a great time with Rico's family. After that we've just been relaxing and doing nice things.  We have a family of our own now, too. We got too cats last Tuesday. They are the most gorgeous cats, in my and Rico's opinion of course ;) But they, Minka and Shiva, are really beautiful. Although they have a little overweight, especially Minka. They are about 3 years old and the previous owner hasn't probably looked after what they eat. I mean, they are indoor cats and don't need as much food as cats who go out every day. So, Minka and Shiva are now on a diet. We've been spending the last days just admiring those divine creatures. We have also had a lot of fun with the ladies. Shiva likes to sit in front of the window and look at the birds outside. She makes funny noises and her tail swings like mad. And last night, when we were making love, we suddenly heard a quiet "meow" and looky who there was...Shiva trying to get into the closet ;) Our little peeping tom ;) So we had to get her out of the room and close the door. For a moment she was meowing behind the door and then gave up.   I've been trying to shoot good photos of the ladies, but it's very difficult. I wouldn't want to take merely snapshots of them, since they are so beautiful. But as soon as I manage to take some good photos, we're going to make a site for Shiva and Minka =)  New Year's Eve was peaceful, we went to a concert (Moonspell, Lacuna Coil etc.) and came home pretty early, at about 2 am or so. But was fine, the concert, although we missed Lacuna Coil and saw only Moonspell and Extol. Moonspell was great but Extol was...what should I say...pure shit. A mixture of Evanescence and Linkin Park. I laughed my ass out, as they started playing. As the female singer started to sing, I wanted to say to Rico that all we need now is a rapper and my oh my... Before I managed to say that, he already began :D They played maybe an hour but it felt longer than one hour... I was really suffering. We both found it extremely funny, when the singer announced that "now we're gonna play a really hard song, probably the hardest song we have ever written! you ready for some hard music?!?!" And the song was EXACTLY as lame as the other ones. Fucking idiots.  Today's the last Saturday of Rico's holiday and I'm not that happy about that. On Monday I'm alone again and I have to go on with my job applications. It's so frustrating! I've sent at least 15 applications and received 5 or 6 answers (negative, of course). I mean what's wrong with those people? In Finland one ALWAYS gets an answer, no matter what the result is. But, what I found great, was that a few young people sent an answer. I sent a free application to 3 culture agencies and from 2 of them I was answered. Except for the big boss in reihe13. Fucking idiot. Too arrogant to write a few words? I'm getting desperate with my applications since it seems impossible to get a reasonable job here. Maybe I should just fuck the boss, like some people do. But that's not my style. And I already have the greatest guy to fuck with ;D  We bought the two first LOTR films on dvd and we watched them on Thu. Now we are ready to go to see the last part. Can't wait. We actually wanted to go tonight, but there are no tickets for tonight. Instead of that we're going to go watch Finding Nemo.   Oh, and we have snow! I mean really snow, not just traces of it. It looks amazing ;) The temperature is around -4 and it's kinda sweet. In Finland, in my hometown it's been -24 :D I miss the finnish winter.  But, I gotta go. Till later.
