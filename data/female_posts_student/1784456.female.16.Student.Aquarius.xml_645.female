Anyway, had loads of fun cringing as Katie freaked out everyone on my msn list... and as we made a cool chatroom called "If you don't know where to go...go here!" its on msn.co.uk, look for it! I think it's under "teen". It rules. No one went on it - yeah!!! Wow, the best thing to do is abstract art on paint. Just doing anything!! It's so much fun! You just do a load of random stuff, select areas, copy and paste them and invert the colours and add text and - ahhh! I've just found my favourite thing to do on the computer. It's even better to do it to music. Wow.
