No teacher showed up in College class... YES! We talked about tons of stuff. Emily was going on about stupid stuff. Flag football was crazy. Nobody wanted to do anything. I pulled a muscle from that damn hip-hop. I completely knocked over Margaret, then five minutes later socked her in the stomach. Then Ann was guarding Blair, and the frisbee was going right towards Blair, and I just yelled "PUSH HER!" Blair caught the frisbee, then Ann LEAPS into the air and pushes Blair's face right into the dirt. Ann kept saying, "The only thing I could hear was your voice inside my head, Allison!" I could not stop laughing for at least ten minutes. It was so funny, I wish you could have all seen it. SWING DANCING! We learned five moves in an hour and a half. We just did the same thing over and over again. This sexual song came on, and Sarah G and I started writhing all over each other, and the teacher just stops, looks at me, and says, "Stop that, there are other people in the room! I think I am going to have to separate you two!" AHHHHHHH. Emily smacked me three times, I was mean to her. We went to Cosi for dinner before the Lax game. Something funny happened, and I howled with laughter, and everybody stared at me. The lax game was really hot. They played a good game, good job girls! That's it, it's hot and I have homework. Ohhh how I long for summer.
