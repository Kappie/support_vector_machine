There were clusters, each category having a particular hallmark you would look for, and disorders that were common to each cluster...  Background being set...since this class I've analyzed everyone I know in order to have healthy conversations, minus diagnosis:  Cluster A: Hallmark includes an avoidance of social relationships, with a "weird" nature, but not psychotic, These people generally have psychotic disorders like pshizophrenia  You've got your  Paranoid Type:  Distrustful, suspicious, their problems are generally everyone else's fault - haven't met anyone like this yet...and if you think I'm going to devulge my analysis on this thing...you are CRAZY (not one of the documented types listed below) I'm listing them to eventually describe a textbook case that I met on my last rotation...dude..anyways you also have,  Schizoid:  long standing loners  Schizotypal:  the guys or girls with the garland of flowers on their head with every belief in the world that they are the princesses of a land called Unicorn and they've been married to an alien, basically magical thinking with odd thought patterns or behavior.  Cluster B:  Hallmark being dramatics, emotional or inconsistent, generally these guys have mood disorders and are substance abusers...your run of the mill heroin fiends   Now in this cluster we have your Histrionic - need I say more than this...every guy or girl you have ever met who is just inches away from your face ALL the time, hands are always actively waving (the patented forearm to forehead - poor me - move), and they are not afraid to stick an occasional tongue in your ear.  This is the girl I met over these last few months, and no, she did not stick her tongue in my ear.  Anyways, part of our exam in this class was an oral exam in which on of these personality types would be played by a patient and it was our job was to appropriately handle the situation...needless to say, I never learned how to handle this one, if a patient ever hit on me..I'd probably turn orange, that's the color we turn, and diplomatically refer them to another doctor.  It is described in a textbook as the Don Juan in men and the "life of the party" for women...  Narcissistic - the person who assumes we were all born to serve them and this is the person who assumes that noone else's dilemna's could be half as heart wrenching, so why bother listening at all...lacks any empathy  Antisocial - the kid who burned ants with a magnifying glass and hit frogs with tennis rackets...the arsen, the bully, no concern for social norms whatsoever...associated with criminal behavior in adulthood.  Borderline - the cutter, the erratic, impulsive person who solves every problem with an overdose attempt.  Then...there's  Cluster C:  Hallmark is a fearful anxious person usually suffering from anxiety disorders in adulthood ******************ME****************SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE************************************************  These guys include the  Avoidant - This is the person who says, "Well, since you guys aren't paying attention to me, because I'm of no consequence, I'll just stand here and face the wall and pout."  Obsessive-Compulsive - Goes without saying...famous for, "What do you mean, the Alphabet Soup should be first in line in the cupboard, it starts with "A".  Dependent - The people who call someone everytime a new pack of gum needs to be purchased, because their choice would never suffice....  Passive-Aggressive - OK ME - these words straight from the textbook, summarize impeccably, "Outward compliance, but inward defiance", sure I would love to do that for you no problem ****insert inner thoughts here******stupid bitch, you've never done anything but make me miserable, you've got serious delusions if you think I would....OK, I'll just do it**************  And that concludes our class in the Characteristics of the basic personality Disorders...With all this typing...I've forgotten my initial reason for explaining all this, oh yeah...the Glimmerman, that's her name...clever manipulation of just one letter would reveal her true identity but...  Ok, so the first day I met her she spoke through me, you know, like asked questions just because she already had a dissertation of an answer ready to fire back at me...I knew this would be fun...she had begun her diet of yogurt and grapes, and she loved telling me how her newborn was doing so well, making his mark on every developmental stage and how she was such a good mother and how this was just her way of getting back into shape...my only response was that she had tried and true dedication to her profession, that to undertake such responsiblities as a student, wife and now a mother were burdens that I respected her for taking on, she was beautiful for just having done what I wish I had the courage and heart to undertake...she blushed and patted me on the head...skipping along to the salad bar..  The weeks progressed we both signed onto the same team for group projects, etc....While most of us were consumed with completing paper work, she got experiences that we see on TV, the entire ER season one....which she didn't fail to constantly remind us of....why was she alotted this luck, she left her paperwork till the end (which ended up being a very intelligent move), and gave up her newborn to a nanny and spent countless hours wedged between some intern's butt cheeks...with questions like what are you doing now, where are you going now, can I come with you now, show me what you're doing now....she was never shy, I watched her in action, she shot winks at the poor newly migrated Indian men who were probably enchanted with the feeling of a set of lips on their asses, regardless, she got her way.  When it came time for our "group projects", only one person helped, not her if you're quick...one of my partners is a new immigrant from Russia, who used to practice medicine there under the influence of vodka and tatu CD's, so he was useless, and she, well, she had now become the owner of bags under her eyes, and a shrunken frame from her misguided diet...she complained of always being too dizzy...too tired...too stressed out...way toooo busy.....see, we weren't ALL doing this rotation with ALL the same responsibilities, we were all vacationing in Ibiza until our projects were due...point being she should probably eat SOMETHING....go home once in a while...and stop being so freaking overproductive...but I replied with oh Glimmerman...we probably will never understand the hardships you undergo, ofcourse you don't have to do a thing (I was being sarcastic, apparently played the part so well, she thought I wasn't kidding) and Glimmerman, gosh...you look so good...so thin it's like you're swimming in your white coat...woman, what have you lost now 15 no 20lbs?????? she blushed patted me on the head and went off to the salad bar to re-affix her face to some intern's butt....  Weeks progressed even more...Glimmerman, had become scarcely available, spending almost twelve hours a day in the hospital...but she did however find me every afternoon at the hour of noon to complain CONSTANTLY...about ANYTHING..how her colleagues (i.e. all of us) were incompetent, how doctors (i.e.  people years advanced to us) were incompetent, how they stressed her out...she would pull me aside, from our colleagues, and whisper like an old woman all these nasty things about anything...and then say well..I'm just going to skip lunch, you know gotta watch my figure...waiting with an ear perked like Wile E. Coyote, for me to say, Gosh...you're wasting away, you know how us girls love being compared to anorexics...  Glimmerman, oh Glimmerman..I ran into her today two weeks post rotation....she pulled me aside again...just to complain, speak of some new intern she has a crush on...and then asked how she looked...I replied...Gosh, Glimmerman...you look so relaxed, so thin, god...how much weight have you lost...she blushed patted me on the head and asked me to keep in touch as she went skipping along to the salad bar....
