She's found meaning, and it says something of society that people are very ready to read about it. Religion thrives where ever it's oppressed. Communist China? Chrisians gather en masse. People smuggle Bibles like cocaine and weapons. And here, in apathetic fat North America, nobody's really recruiting. They're allowed to be religious, and it suddenly takes a big element out of things. They don't  need  to pray for their next meal - if worst comes to worst, there are always food banks. Hurt yourself? Here's a doctor. No need to pray for healing. I think bin Laden should have bombed his own followers, and  then  blamed the Western infidels. People gather together after a blow - they're defensive, co-operative, and supportive of one another. Hell - why am I strategising for a terrorist? For the record, I also think bin Laden should be made to have a sex change, then live as a widow following his own principals. There's my piece for now.
