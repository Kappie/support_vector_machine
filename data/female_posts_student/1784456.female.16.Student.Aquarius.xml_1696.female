Anna and I tried it in a very boring German lesson the other day and we felt lots better, then we had to list good things about ourselves.  Basically we all need to be pro me (or pro yourself, wotever way you look at it, its the same!!)  This could well be my last blog before I go skiing so, adios amegoes and Happy Valentines day, love you both lots!!  See you when I get back. Mwah xx
