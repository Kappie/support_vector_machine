I really enjoy going to new places and I dream of traveling to Europe. I take French class in school, I have already taken two years and I plan to take two more. I have a really great teacher and I think I am a pretty great student, because I enjoy it. I have a freind who is a year older who was planning to go to Europe next summer. Her name's Kyla and she made plans to go and then her travel buddy ditched her and she has nobody to go with. I want to go so bad and I really am going to try to be able to. My mom would love to see me go except she doesn't do very well when it comes to extra money. My dad's fiance thinks it is an awesome opportunity. She went to Europe when she was about 18 and she loved it. She told me some stories, mostly about men flashing her on the subway. My dad on the other hand, would probably rather I didn't travel that far until I was 18. I would be 17 if I went with Kyla. But he wouldn't stop me especially if I paid for all of it. Anyway, I think the trip would be great. We would stay in hostels and meet tons of new people from country to country. This is definately something I would want to do, be out there all on our own.
