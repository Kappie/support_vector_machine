Has sex always been a sport? Is it only NOW that the media has begun shedding light on our bedroom secrets? Sometimes I feel like the only virgin in the entire world. Of course, most of the people in my small group of friends have made it past the touchy feely stage--we are only high schoolers. And of course, my church friends are in the same boat as I am. But what about the others? It seems that a new victim is reeled in everywhere I turn. People that I see as pure, moral beings are really sexing it up with anything of the opposite sex! Is pre-marital sex a fad? Will it fade? Is virgin the new "faux pas"?  About 4 or 5 months ago, my friend, who is 17 years old, had a baby. She gave it to a wonderful, loving family, and visits the little girl about once every month. She has a healthy relationship with the parents, and realizes that she will not always have a part in her daughter's life. I'm glad that everything turned out right for her in the end, but her fairy-tale ending is starting to sugar coat the reason the whole thing happened. She used to be a huge activist for abstinence before she met Mr. "Perfect". But here's the catch: Mr. Perfect wasn't the daddy. She was on rebound guy then- and she paid the price. It makes me think that people should start watching out for themselves. There are so many more people that I know of that SHOULD be pregnant. Some of them have been with the whole damn school. I vaguely remember talking to a senior once who proudly proclaimed that she was a born again virgin.....because she hadn't had sex in six months. I'm pretty sure my jaw dropped to the floor then. What happened to being a first time virgin? When did people get to be "born again virgins"? How can you take back an act like sex?  After I get over the initial shock of hearing about people's sex lives, I eventually start to think if it is less Christian to judge these people for what they have done, or to actually engage in the act of pre-marital sex. Now, I don't stop being friends with people that have sex. I'm not that shallow. But a part of me does lose a bit of respect for them. Sometimes I see sex as a loss of control, or people giving into temptation. Sure, I've gone shopping and come home with a few too many shoes than I should've gotten- but is it the same thing? Sex has become such a regular act in society that becoming pregnant is actually a bad thing! Since when did giving birth to a beautiful baby that you created become a curse? How would you feel if your mother had bookmarked abortion information online when she found out she was carrying you? How would you feel if she had cried when she saw the results? How would you feel if she had considered horrible things to rid herself of you? A child is NOT a curse! But every television show these days has the infamous "I think I might be pregnant" line. There is always the scared look from the possible father, the crying possible mother, and the angry possible grandparents. Then you have to wait a week to find out the results, and if she's not there are always tears of joy and the line "I would have supported you no matter what". I find this disgusting. This proves that people should THINK before they ACT.  But then I have to consider something else. Am I a virgin because I know it is logically the right way to be? Am I a virgin because I can't get any? Am I a virgin because it is "Un-Christian-like" (as people may say)? Or am I a virgin because sex scares the living hell out of me? I think it might be all of them. When I sit and actually consider the pros and cons of having sex before marriage (specifically at this AGE), I am hit with a research paper of cons and a few sentences of pros. Hell, I don't even think the pros made sentence status. I guess that the biggest reason that I am a virgin is that intimacy is a very scary thing. I am very set on finding Mr. Right, and I don't intend on wasting my time on people who I know will only be losers. I would hate to remember my first intimate moment with "some guy in algebra class". The worst would be not even remembering the first. I guess that is just my way of thinking. I have barely been to make out time yet, let alone sexual acts. (and I am not under any circumstances sticking a dick in my mouth). Most people call me a prude, and  I think "Fuck, I'm a prude". But I guess that instead I should be thinking "yes, I'm prude, and that's why I don't have a fucking baby living in me when I'm only 16." and never say it outloud.  So, in this time of ever-growing sexual acceptance, I remain part of a dwindling crowd known as the virgin club. No, we don't hold meetings or have fundraising events- although I'm thinking we should. We don't support DARE or sex-ed. We just sit at home watching Sex and the City and thinking "I wish it was my life... without the sex" And we remain abstinent and happy...for the meantime.  I will be sure to update if my virgin status changes....but I doubt it will.  Happy thoughts.
