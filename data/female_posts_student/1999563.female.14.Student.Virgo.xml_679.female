Improv is SO addicting. It's great...  Did I tell you I am going to the beach tomorrow? Well, I am. And, I heard Evan is going to be there too so I better not see him. Haha. My dads close friend [he was in my parents wedding..] is coming up from Lousiana. They have a daughter my age and another duaghter my sisters age so it should be fun. I haven't seen 'em since AI was like 10 or 11, but from what I remember they were cool.  I will ABSOLUTELY escape from the beach house and update my blog. Absolutely meaning I will ride down in the lugage carrier [some of my friends now what I am talking aboooot] and run out the garage to update my blog. Well, acctually, i'm not stupid enough to do that, but we'll see.  i was watching the 10 o'clock news and that policeman who died did go to my church. The reason I know this was because my pastor was on the television..he looked sad...   Have an awesome week ya'll.  BTW, e-mail me whenever!! Haha. This is just a "selfless" pitch to make myself feel special by not getting junk mail.  fantora[at] gmail.com  fun stuff.
