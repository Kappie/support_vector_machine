No Holiday is complete without watching a special...and I loved the comic strip.  Schroeder...a character I've always liked. I guess the description is a lot like me, especially the neurosis part, hahaha. I'm halfway joking, but anyway...I've always thought of myself as a Charlie Brown, but I guess this is more fitting for me.   Wow, I sure did ramble.
