BUT, i will be back sometime on aug 29th...so we'll have a few days to chill.  until then.  so i've been grandpa sitting this week.  i'm not susposed to leave him alone too long, which i've been able to do pretty good thus far.  most nights that i've been with him i came over to the house after work and stayed in or if i went out, i waited till 11ish before leaving.  for instance, i went out to karaoke on tues night.  but i waited to leave until he was in bed b/c he doesnt need anyone watching him sleep.   however, today will be a test.  i plan on going hiking and that means i'll be gone for about 5 hours.  that also means i might not be back in time to feed and water him.  to solve this problem, i've left several notes around the house for him.  i've also pre-prepared his dinner and left a note telling him to put in the microwave and press start.  well see what happens, but hopefully mom and dad will be back by then.    on a different topic.  i happened to run into one of my professors yesterday at steppin out.  i didnt think she really remembered me b/c i've only had her for one class, but i have gone and talked w/ her at her office a few times.  well, the next thing i knew....she comes up to me and starts talking.  she did remember me...i was surprised.  however, i think she was trying to get jon or i to babysit for her.  if we hadnt been rolling down the hill and then tried to race other kids down the hill, she probably would not have even spoken to us.  but yeah....rolling down hills is still fun no matter what age.  be advised, you may get a little bit dizzy.
