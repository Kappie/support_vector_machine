It's not really a simple "story" but rather a look into the bond two people can have, the strengths and weaknesses of humans, and the circumstances with which different people cross our paths... I like Roger Ebert's review in which he says, "we have seen good people with good intentions who have their lives destroyed because they have had the bad luck to come across a weak person with shabby desires."  I won't go through the whole movie, but as I write my thoughts, the plot will probably reveal itself, so if you want to watch the movie and not know what happens, you should probably stop reading.  I must admit that throughout most of the movie, I had more sympathy for the Behrani family than I did for Kathy (Jennifer Connelly's character). After all, it was through Kathy's lack of responsibility that her house was seized. I understand that it must have been really upsetting that her husband left her. In fact, she was devastated. But is it too harsh to say that we can't stop living our own lives? That we still live in this world, whether we like it or not. Life will go on around us, and it is up to us not to let it pass us by? Or at the very least, open our mail and not live in squalor. Meanwhile, Behrani has been working day and night with two jobs so he can purchase this home for his family.   But the circumstances with which Kathy lost her house were pretty asinine. I mean, $500? That's it? Come on, that's nothing to lose a house over. But that wasn't the fault of Behrani. If I were Kathy, I'd be pretty pissed too.   One of the thing that really struck me was how both Kathy and Behrani admitted that they made a mistake. Kathy keenly felt that she screwed up. Her father worked for 35 years to purchase this house and she managed to lose it in 8 months. And Behrani was man enough to admit to son that he was wrong and probably should have sold the house back for the price he had bought it.  You can tell that both parties are good people. Beharni's family treated Kathy with kindness and respect even though she was trying to take away their home.  Tragedy befalls everyone because of Kathy's boyfriend who Behrani instantly recognizes as weak hearted. The boyfriend is a cop who uses his power to bully the family and his fear to close his eyes to the truth. Even after there seems to be some sort of truce between Kathy and the family, he disregards everyone's wishes and goes on his own power trip agenda.   When Behrani's son got shot, I just started to weep. He was innocent in the whole thing - just trying to be a man like his father always wanted him to be, protecting his father and family... After his son was taken away, Behrani just repeated over and over "I want only my son, I want only my son." And you just knew that he didn't care about the house. He prayed to God that he would give everything away, if only he could have his son. After his son died, I wondered how Behrani would break the news to his wife because it was just *crush* her. She would feel as if she had nothing. Behrani knew that this was *exactly* how she was going to react, and the fact that I knew this too is an amazing testament to how the movie reveals its characters. So instead, he never tells her, and as soon as I understood what was going to happen, I also understood that there was no other way. Behrani's wife seemed to know what was going on too, you could just see it in her eyes.   Kathy's grief when she finds their bodies felt so real. You can see the grief and guilt consume her. And even though I didn't feel as much sympathy for her for losing the house, I did feel that it wasn't all her fault, that everyone had a part in this. And... perhaps the fact that she was the only one left to live with this pain deserves the greatest pity of all.
