AND. a complete stranger left a comment. another reason to run around naked...maybe this time just in my house..... i would leave a  comment back, but i'm at work and this computer is the queerest most horrendous thing on the face of the planet and is blocking the page where you can leave comments.  omfg. this horrid WE-Blocker thing is supposed to block sexually charged sites (apparently someone a while ago was caught looking at porn...and now they have these ldjgoautqw;lejkfa;l things on here) and things that are inappropriate. well how the hell is editting my blog sexually charged and inapproriate?!?!?!?!?!?!? dumb machines....*fumes* my report is coming along...sort of...i've got nine pages now...with a few of them only titled and mostly blank...but yeah...the minimum is ten...and i've got more pictures to add..so i'm doing ok. and then .... *evil smile* i'm gone from here forever!!!!!!!! mwahahahahahahahaha and then school starts...and i will go on hating day to day life. i was thinking about this the other day: i would really hate it if someone i dated turned gay. i mean sure it's good for them that they came out or whatever...but i would feel bad b/c in the back of my head i would be thinking "holy shit...i turned them gay." haha. maybe it will be a will and grace thing, and i will have a gay best friend...who i once dated....egh...point being...it would be a catatrophic blow to my poor little ego. in this sick demented way, because everything  IS  about me afterall.  thus far....i don't think anyone i've dated would turn gay....the last one turned "straight edge/hard core" ... but that's really not the same thing. ;) though his pants just do seem to get tighter and tighter every time i see him... and when a guys jeans are as tight as mine...i begin to wonder. *wonders if he'll ever read this...* most likely not... so anyways...this has gone on long enough.
