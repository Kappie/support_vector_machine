I probably will, because I'm getting really anxious and ADD. Ahhh!!! I can't even concentrate on this fucking entry. What a waste of my time.  I'm stoned, depressed, and angry; all at the same time. It's no fun. I'm not going to do this ever again. And I'm putting my heart under lock and key, and then throwing the key in the river. I guess this is the end of love, and relationships, for awhile.
