We leave on Sunday, and get on the cruise on Monday.  The father hath spoken, however, and apparently, the only way I will be traveling (other than car and airplane) is by wheelchair.  Yay.  One of those, as my little sister so graciously pointed out, has one of those ten foot tall flags on it.  So not only do I have to ride in a wheelchair, but a wheelchair that just  screams  "Look, I'm riding in a wheelchair."  Let's just say I'm not happy about this.  But on a good note, I am leaving here in a few minutes to get a manicure and pedicure.  I hate going though, because the people will only talk in Vietnamese, and then they laugh, and I think they have to be talking about me, because otherwise, why would they have to speak Vietnamese.  Next time, I think I'll take Josh, so he can tell me if they say "doll" or "uncle."  Um, also, I bought 3 new pairs of shoes.  YAY!!!!  Not like the guys really care, but for Rosie's and Elizabeth's sakes, one is a formal white pair to go with churchish stuff, one is white, and made out of like this hemp stuff, and it has those like browny, neutral colored beads in it (that's for casal dresses, skirts, and white capris; they go with anything, and the other is a denim pair to go with my denim skirt and capris and stuff.  They have this little buckle type thing on the top.  They are so adorable.  And they all have really cute heels, but none of them are that tall.  Ok, sorry for boring you, guys.  Oh, my puppy is being so cute.  We got mulch delivered today so that William can put it out sometime this weekend, and she's trying to climb it, but she's not succeeding.  I think her feet are too big.  Awww, isn't that cute?  Ok, i gotta go.  See yall later.
