Let's see what kind of remarks/comments Ms Leong would put in the report!  `Sihui is a very nosey and inqisitive student who pries into teachers' affairs but if you get used to it she's quite okay.`  `She is a good class chairperson; although sometimes very forgetful and pushes herself all over the limit.`  `Always helpful and doesn't mind running errands for teachers.`  `I enjoy her presence and intelligent questions in class.`  whahahahha I'm so bhb. =D
