Althugh I am still as ill as a foot and mouth ridden cow I have survived the day to London, thank God for Lockets!!! Ah dudes!!!!! It was soooo much fun! Me and Dave had a good laugh and our seats in the theatre were excellent, about 6 rows from the front. the show itself 'Contact' was excellent. The lights, stage, script, costumes, dance was brilliant!!! I have found a new found love for a) going to the theatre and b) swing dancing. Fabbo. Now I can't wait for 'This Is Our Youth' Jo, now I know more of what to expect at a theatre I am not as nervous so: FREDDIE AND CHRIS!!!! WAHOOOOOOOO!
