It's about torture, and of course, I have the section on S/M and what it means to accept some forms of pain in the realms of personal choice, versus others, blah, blah, blah. I'm just hoping I won't giggle when I outline the definition of S/M, or when I talk about some pretentious artist who pierced his head to look like Jesus. So angsty, so full of ennui. How writhing for me! I kind of hate performance art, but hopefully that won't show while I'm talking to the class about it all. Everything else is very serious, as you might imagine, but I'm still anxious about the one risque part. Sadomasochism. My favorite thing to talk about in front of a group of people trying to be serious about torture. Oh well, at least I wasn't the guy who had to talk about masturbation last week. Who knew colonialism was so dirty?
