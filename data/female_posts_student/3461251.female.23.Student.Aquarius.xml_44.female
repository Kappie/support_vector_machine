However, so many changes as happened in such little time....  -My energy is up! -My self-esteem is sky high!  I actually want to look better, when I leave the house. -I walk, daily. -My house is cleaner. -I enjoy leaving the house - Just so I can walk more.  Gosh, life is great! :-) I went cloths shopping yesterday and found out 2 things..... One - I can wear jeans again! Yay!  Two - My boobs are shrinking along with the rest of my body!  Talk about sucking ass!  I always thought I'd be the one person that can say "haha! my boobs stayed big!" - I know thats selfish but damn it!   I'll live! :-)
