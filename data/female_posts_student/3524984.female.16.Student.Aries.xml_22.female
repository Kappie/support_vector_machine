Oooh, who is the girl behind that wretched name? I have no clue. I just consider me... well, me. Just normal. But when people who have known me for a long time, they know I'm not 'normal' But then again... who is normal these days.  I Am...  Small town girl, I am. I don't get out much. I like blue cotton-candy with club soda [Who would have known?] I've always had long hair, I've never cut it short. I've done drugs, and came out of it alive. [Result: I'm fucked up in the fucking head, fuck man!] I had two brother's. An older one and a younger twin brother. I only have one now. Mike, the older brother he's 18. [Xavier August Jean-Louis Beaulne, may you rest in peace] I like to read, I can't read more than one book at a time, otherwise... I get all confused with the story lines and such. I've had pink hair -I swore I knew what I was doing- I like extreme make-up. And clear lip gloss. I hate glasses, and I have to wear them all the time. *Grr* I like emo [No, I'm not emo] Ok, forget that last comment! I don't enjoy labels. Though I am a mix of everything. That;s what I would like to think. I think fast, and I type even faster. I usually end up regretting what I say to certain people. I've made serious mistakes, but it's just basically Live Life And Learn? I am parentless. My mom died when I was young. My dad is some random fucktard. *I hate him* I've been in several different homes across Ontario [It can be a bad thing] But right now, I'm back to VKH. Where I belong! I'm addicted to the internet. Well, not really. Just a bit. I like to drink, not nessicarily 'till I get drunk. But vodka seriously rocks! [Rum  Coke is a must too] I smoke. Too much. I am a perfectionist. I am not afraid to admit I'm perfect! ;) I care for one person and one person only, and that is my dear brother Mike. DUDE, You dissed my pancakes.... in front of Vanny. *insulted stare* How dare you? I am a world known stalker. hehe, Catch me if you can. No one knows what it's like, to be the sad man? I know what it's like. I smile, I laugh and I take prozac. No really. I am suicidal at times. I can get through it without hurting myself most of the time. I am addicted to eyeliner. I like beach towels. The colours... are cool. I am Shannon-Emily. Lesser of two evils maybe?
