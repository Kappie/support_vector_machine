I get someone who does not know their job, doesn't seem to care to want to know their job, and doesn't really want to help me. I get so frustrated that I hang up on them, mutter to myself what a jackass they are and go on with my task...minutes later realizing that the jackass was sitting in the cubicle next to me the entire time. So I get that awful feeling in the pit of my stomach- I think it was my foot just inserted a little too far in my mouth but I recover quickly because I really don't care!    He never said a word to me. And he shouldn't! He doesn't know his freaking job!!!
