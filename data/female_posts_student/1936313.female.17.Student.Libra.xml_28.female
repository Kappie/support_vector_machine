That made Spanish interesting this morning at least. Lots of fun, we're learning "el futuro" (Future Tense.. WHO said Spanish was hard!! Haha) and so we were making up mock new years resolutions in Spanish... mine went as follows:  1 - Yo escribiré una buena novela. (I will write a good book.) 2 - Yo atormeintaré mi hermano más. (I will torment my brother more... MY Favorite!!) 3 - Yo aprenderé a hablar Italiano. (I will learn Italian.... Sperls was hurt that I was gonna betray Spanish for Italian.. haha... I betrayed French for Spanish, didn't I?)  There was more but i don't feel like digging through my character map to find all the accents.. so theres your Spanish lesson for the day. Quiero un novio tántriko. (-grins wickedly- my new favorite saying)  Spanish was followed by my dentist appointment.. which wasn't toooo disastrous... -very very sarcastic- I only have 12 new cavities. (Dear Lord... haha.. I know what you are all thinking.... I do brush my teeth almost every day.. but i'm bad about flossing..) Its 12 infected teeth, 6 cavities... the cavities are between teeh (that'll teach me about flossing)... they're only pinprick, vera small... but deep enough to cause a lot of pain later down the road...... so for the next month I'll be seeing my dentist regularily... we'll become friends! Woohoooo... Plus side: I got a free toothbrush!!  Ugh.. AND they took major x-rays to check on another tooth She had fixed way back when to make sure it was okay now... so I had to take my earrings out.. (boohoo right? hah..) I forgot to put them back in right after sooo naturally.... one of the holes closes up (how the hell does that work... grrr) sooo I've spent the last few hours debating driving a hole back through... (Ewwwww i know) finally I just got the ice and forced it back through.... and now it hurts like hell... Damn dentist!!!!  Filled out all my government finance forms for the registrar on Friday... soooo now its gettin an itty bit scary........still haven't heard from GMC... so crap.. haha. .oh well...  oh.. AND IT SNOWED!!! haha.. and now its sunny and everythings green again.. .but we seriously had some real snow before!!! Big flakes and all...
