It's funny but before I saw the movie, when I found out where it was filmed, I must admit - as a proud Southerner (well, sort of) - I was shocked and bothered.  But the scenery in the film wasn't bad and didn't look un-Southern, and I was even looking out for it.  Eventually through the movie, I began to forget completely about the fact that it wasn't filmed in the South - or anywhere near - at all.  Of course, this may be less because it ceased to bother me and more because other things about the movie began to bother me more, but honestly it looked OK to me.  Partially because, as this article points out, it would have been...difficult (but certainly not impossible) to actually film in the United States because of the development that has gone on there, and also because the story takes place in the northern part of the South (Virginia? Or North Carolina?), which while it certainly doesn't look like Romania, certainly looks less like the flatness of the Mississippi Gulf Coast where I grew up.     Update :  For the Jude Law fans among us - and I do know who you are - scan down to the bottom of the article, as there is the slightest mention of him.
