Purchase books   4. Find a nice bathroom on campus   5. Do homework .. but save that until 8 a night so that it will keep you busy and prolong the urge to crawl in to bed (which would result in a 1 am wakeup)      Today was the first hebrew class.  I'm in the second level.  One up from beginners.  The shame.  But I was one of the better kids in the class.  IT was really really fun.  At first I couldn't make words form.. but then I was really into it... and I bought my first book!!     Discovered 3 varieties of washrooms so far.   1. Dark scary smelly   2. Clean bright smelly   3. Clean bright non-smelly!!!!!   My big discovery of the day those nice toliets.  The toilet paper here is pink.    I"m feeling good today.  Chatting with Michal again this morning.  Ate the best yoghurt of my life..   its yoplait but for some reason it tastes way better here!!  Apparently another roommate who speaks English had moved into the flat.. MAYBE SHE'll BE MY FRIEND?!?!?  I have this really werid approach to making friend.  I"m really anti social in groups settings.. saying very little.  I wait and let the grops forms and then I work my way into groups at a smaller level.  I didn't actually DECIDE to do this.. its just how it seems to be working out.  Wish me luck.
