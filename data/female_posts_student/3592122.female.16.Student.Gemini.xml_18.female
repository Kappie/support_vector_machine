These wolves are more protective of themselves and usually never ever have contact with humans. Now this type of wolf has mystic powers at night for that is their element. A night wolf can also live up to 500 years old.  Cool isnt it? You might want to be careful tough because they can lose their temper easily. Over all the night wolf is a majestic and swift creature.
