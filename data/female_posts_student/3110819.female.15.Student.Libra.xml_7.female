Thursday- d's b-day party was fun...church ran longer than expected, so I was later than I thought I would be, but still not as late as k and h.  we watched, since she loves disney, the little mermaid, and then daddy day care since that was one of her presents.  Played some pool, ate some cake, got no sleep, the usual.  Friday- got home from d's party, took a shower, ate lunch (mac!), packed.  We left for my g-ma's house around 3:30...hey it occured to me I need to fix the time zones on this- anyway...got there around 5:30, fish for dinner...(ugh) Stayed up till about 11.  Sat- went shopping @ Target w/ my aunt, g-ma, and little cousin L.  I got this awesome new swimsuit, green w/ green and tan stripes and this fake buckle thing.  I got some flip flops too.  I am now officially broke.  In debt actually- 5 bucks to my mom and something else...  We had subcity for lunch, went back to the house and did some homework.  Sat night my mom and dad and I went out to eat w/ my sis and her fiance, and then to church.  It was awesome, I was so proud I thought i might cry.  We didn't get back to my g-ma's till midnight.    Sun- Easter dinner w/ the family, went home.  Stayed up and did more homework.   Mon- school.  Especially bad cause of how tired I was.  Plus I've now got allergies or something so I feel like crap.  Lotsa homework last night as well.  Today- Now I can get to the juicy stuff.  j/k.  School was boring, as usual.  I had a clarinet lesson after school but it was pretty short so that was ok.  Came home and did homework. Talked on msn for awhile, studied for my history test which is 2morrow.  Then L called me and told me some especially disturbing news.  One of my friends has this pretty steady bf.  She had gone farther with him than I thought she should have already, but L told me that she had showered w/ the guy and he had fingered her a couple of times.  This disturbs me to no end.  She said K said she wouldn't be as close w/ him as she is now w/o doing it, which I think is friggin stupid.  I'm scared she might go all the way w/ him.  She's only known him for 6 months, and she always struck me as one of those people who would never lose it until marriage.  I don't know what to think.  I should go do homework, but I feel a little better now that I've got it kinda out of my system.
