You see, I am full-figured, I am fairly happy, I am acquiring good self-esteem, but I flat out am not healthy at my weight, and I am not happy about that. I love my body as is, and I want to stay the same as I am. I feel adverse to becoming thin or even average. My skin crawls and I choke up at the thought of it. I know that how I feel isn't common, but it is my reality, and I have had to realize in the past few days that vanity and preference aside, if I don't want my body to screw me in the end, I have to attain a healthy weight the only smart way: eating healthier and exercising, on a continual basis. Atkins and the Zone be damned! If I have to do something I don't really want to do, I am at least going to do it the right way. I have been walking with one of my best friends in the whole world who also wants to achieve a healthy weight, we have been going for about an hour, sometimes a little less. Today was a beautiful walk around town, kind of got lost, but it is so nice to talk and vent about what is going on, what our plans are (yay! camping in august!) and sometimes we just enjoy the silence. I feel I will be able to achieve a healthy weight if I bite the bullet and do what I am supposed to, and leave the results (in all of my life) to my higher power.
