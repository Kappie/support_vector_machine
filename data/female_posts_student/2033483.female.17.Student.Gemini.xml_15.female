What about at the beginning of the year when Mr. Denovon said students should have only 1 1/2 hours of homework a night, huh?  I'd be happy to only have an hour and a half.  And all those news reports I've been reading that say students don't have enough homework.  Ya wanna know what I have to say to those?  Of course you do.  Those people can kiss my ass while doing my 4 hours of homework, damnit! (angry mood)  I need a vacation BAD!
