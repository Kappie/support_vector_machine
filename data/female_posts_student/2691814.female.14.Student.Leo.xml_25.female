They're just really stupid. Juan said i look at people weirdly..like i don't look straight at them just kinda off to the side. But the funny part was geography. We had an old geezer for a sub and he just took everything the wrong way. Someone would like...not even be talking and he'd think they would be sayin bad things like cuss words or something of the sort.      But, I was glad that Mr. Hunt wasn't there so i wouldn't have to hear his loud breathing. I wish you could just hear it lol. And his come-over!!! omg its just terrible. He thinks he's like so cool with that hair "don't" lol cuz one day we were all just sitting and he was like..combing his hair to the side. I can't stand him. He's just probably one of the most weird teachers I've ever had in my life! lol...I'm talking about the main geography teacher(not the sub)...anyway...In history we're learning about the holocaust and its just depressing. Everyone was seriously in awe of what ms.dempsey had to say for ONCE!     After school I hung out with the guys plus gabby. We were all skateboarding and just being weird. I met Josh's brother. He's pretty cool i guess. He like jumped in the bushes for some odd reason lol. Even gabby wouldn't jump in there cuz it has like snakes and things there. But anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest for tomarrow. CUZ tomarrows FRIDAY! yay...later gatorz lol
