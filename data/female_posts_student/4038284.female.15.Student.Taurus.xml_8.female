Two days ago, I went to Southport Beach, and Formy Point Squirrel Park, (where Wayne Rooney's girlfriend chucked her 25K ring...as you can imagine, there were a lot of people there.); The squirrels were fun, one even came up and ate out of my hand (my mum recorded it, if anyone wants to see it); and then we went to the beach. I found this gorgeous shell, and picked it up to take it home, but then I screamed, and threw it to the floor. For in there, there was a large hermit crab. Anyway, I wanted the shell, so we took the crab out, and mum called me cruel, but I said it was a thief anyway, right? But mum still said I was cruel, so we made it another makeshift house -grin- using some other smaller shells I had found.  Then we ran into the sea (mum made another video) and then dried our feet and headed back. Southport was quite good too, there was this really cool hall of mirrors. That was really fun!
