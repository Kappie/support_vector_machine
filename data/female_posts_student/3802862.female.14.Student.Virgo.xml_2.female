Mum's a bit of a workaholic but i wished she didn't work and stress so much because we already have a big house,clothes, food, cars and everything else we need to survive, we have more stuff then most people need. We don't need money to buy us happiness, so long as everyone healthy and cheerful, i'm satisfied. If mum didn't work so much she wouldn't have bad astma and she'd get to relax. but when mum doesn't work she's either cleaning the house or sitting on the lounge watching tv all sad and upset. she says working takes her mind off all the bad things that's happened in the past and there's alot of it.  Which is sad because i thought i was the only one suffering from it. A few weeks ago i was lost in tears while i carved my name in my arm with a knife, i didn't do it deep enough for it to bleed but i done it deep enough to scar. so now i'm scarred for life and am constantly reminded of it. This past year i've learnt that to let go of something is a tragic loss but the outcomes of it is far worse. My dad left us to live in the Philippines in February (which broke my heart) but it was for the better. He didn't want us to watch our parents fight day in and day out. but it still hurts because he's not here with me. When he left i cried and i cried lots after that. I know my parents will never get back together but i still have hopes of one day us being a family again. My dad made alot of mistakes which tore our family apart in the first place but with him in the Phils. it's slowly bringing us together again. I know in this generation there are heaps of families that are torn up and its nearly normal but i never thought it would ever happen to me.  better go cos skool starts tomoro, will one day write in detail wat did happen in the past that still haunts me today.  peace out
