Today I attended the funeral of a fellow runner who was on his way to graduation.  It made me very depressed.  I feel kind of guilty if I laugh or make a joke because someone might think I'm not considerate.   I'm going to move onto another topic, I'm too sad to continue with that one.  Well, as of right now I am sitting at my computer, typing, with vasaline stuffed up my nose.  Attractive, huh?  Sadly I have fallen into a cold this week (I have a cold and it is hot outside, crazy) and dry nose is a side affect (effect?, I should know, I was just tested on those).  So is consistant coughing, itchy, soar throat, and dry irritated eyes.  Boy, I must look attractive! What I don't understand is that my nose is so dry it hur, yet it keeps on running and running and running, etc.  Speaking of running, I have been a slacker this week.  C'est la vie!  I can validate that I was sick and couldn't run as much as last week, I hope it doesn't make me look lazy and fat.  I have a fear that I'm going to get fat.  I think everyone does somewhere in their conscience.  Hey... what did the zero say to the eight?  A) Nice belt!!!  hahaha  I crack myself up.  Well, I should be going because I need my beauty sleep.  Like it will help!     Hasta la vista Baby!                katie
