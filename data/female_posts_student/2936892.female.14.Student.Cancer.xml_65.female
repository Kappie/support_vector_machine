 Was so upset tt i wanted to be lyk ap in my cca... I dun wanna be enthu le but when face wif e seniors, i jus cant do it. it's so crappy. I'm such a hypocrite!!!grr, angry at myself for all e tinks i hv done.Srry ppl who i kinda snapped at. jus bant control my emotions too well. 
 Tml sports day. we actually got in e 4x400m relay. wat a sux. surely cant win den still run for wat? waste of time n energy... 
 oh yar dere's sth i wanna share... was doin my quiet time n i came upon dis verse 1 Peter 5:7. It says "Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you" sometime God really speaks to u in a special way... it's jus up to u if u wanna listen. So trust god n put ur burdens on him...
