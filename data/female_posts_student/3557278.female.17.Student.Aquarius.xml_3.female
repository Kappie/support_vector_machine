EXAM NOTES, PRACTICE PAPERS, MY DAMN PIP!!! ugh! teachers must think we have an insane ammount of free time! I spose they want us to do well, but come on! Today ms L (that sounds so odd) said to me "yeh get ur dad to give u all the catholic school papers!" I'm sure that would go down juuust great. Anyways, I wonder how many people in our grade will actually study? Hmmm, interesting.
