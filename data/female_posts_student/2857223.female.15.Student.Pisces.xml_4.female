My computer teacher really freaks me out...hope she doesn't read that. This class is so boring.   We're supposed to be working on profiles for college, but it's a Friday, and I'm thinking I'm going to screw the portfolios for today. I'm surfin the web for pictures instead ;) Websense isn't cooperating though, crap.  My friends and I are making future plans to go to college in Hawaii and become professional surfers...my other friend will be hanging out in the strip clubs she said. She wants to go to New York to visit the Night at the Roxbury club...too bad it's in LA. Now they've changed their minds to Florida...I could live in South Beach for 4 years :P  My friend's trying to figure out where her great-aunt lives..."it's next to Las Vegas"...I asked her if she meant a state or a city; she said she didn't know. I started naming off all the major Nevada cities, then the states next to Nevada...she said no, not any of those. Wait, she's got it figured out...here she goes..."OH! It's Nevada!"...well DER, Las Vegas is IN Nevada...ahh, my friend's brain at it's best. Now she's talking about farting for her "Valedictorian" speech...fascinating.
