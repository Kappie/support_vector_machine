My next course for next term is Drama with Mr. Van Camp.  I've heard that he's nice.  Hopefully he won't be mean.  Today in science, we disected cow's eyes.  Many people refused to do it.  Others were yelling and screaming.  I just sat there at the table, looking at the eye in the pan infront of me.  I casually picked up the blade and cut the eye in half as I was told to do.  Inside the eye, there was goo and this really nice floresent blue film on "la r√©tine".  I took out "la lentille" and bounced it on the table (yes, it is bouncy).  After having fun with the eye, I threw it out and washed the pan.  I can't wait to disect something in grade 9!If you've ever disected something, you'll know what I mean.  Regarding "The brick".  I am pleased to announce that I have taken the brick off my back.  *Puts hand on heart and looks up at the clear sky*.  I've been waiting for that moment.  Kevan is comming over tomorrow for the first time in weeks.  Once again, Robin was suppose to join us but she is going to the yc (Please refer to last post). I guess I'll have to teach her about brace some other time.  Anywho, I'd best be going now.    Adieu.
