Not much going on lately...if you're sick of all this coverage of Michael Jackson raise your hand!  Can you say histrionic hypochondriac boys and girls?  So here's a list of things I plan to do when I go back to school:   1) pay less money for stuff...yet have less money at the same time. 2) update my webpage...you know things were far more interesting on here before I entered the real world. 3) take vacations...that I can't afford because I won't be working full time. 4) get back to my normal tolerance level...I'm on wine glass #2 and the keys feel funny... 5) do a better job of keeping in touch with people.  At least Ryan has the excuse of being in Belgium.  I've no excuse, I'm just lazy. 6)learn all kinds of really cool things. 7) see if I can make it through a class without buying (or checking out) the text book.  Bruce and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day.  We went to Leonardo's 706 for dinner and then went to Borders where we purchased Circus and Mexican Polka CDs for the value price of $1.  (And worth every penny...well, maybe not the polka cd...)  I bought the Narnia Chronicles.  I haven't read them since 5th grade and I think I have Goblet of Fire memorized at this point.  On Saturday we went to see Gangs of New York...I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.  I liked the U2 song (duh) but I agree with Bruce that it didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the soundtrack all that well.  Of course, it's Bono, so whatever.  Sunday I finally got my cell phone replaced...again.   Apparently there was a recall on the batteries, but they decided not to make any non-defective ones.  So instead I have a bright, shiny silver phone.  I've named her Sue.  However, the problem is I have once again lost all of your phone numbers.  This, of course means that you get to call me!  And then we can catch up on all the wonderful mundaneness that is life after college.  Bruce and I have been on a reality tv show kick for the past few months, but I must say the season finales have been downers so far (with the exception of the Mole because I was totally right!  Ha!)  Joe Millionaire was totally predictable, not the mention that he should be sterilized since he is literally too dumb to be permitted to breed.  High School Reunion just reaffirmed my decision to never attend any of mine and proved that some people really don't mature past the 12th grade.  On Wednesday is the Bachelorette finale, which is kind of pointless since it's been all over the news who she ends up with (I totally would have picked the other guy...)  The good news is that I attended a really terrible conference today.  It was really offensive, and would have made all the Rehab Professors hair curl.  "Labeling a child as an exceptional education student doesn't do any good.  We should just put them in classes with everyone else so that they can learn to exist in normal society."  Yeah, because that's not offensive.  And let's just put the low IQed kids in with everyone else, so they can feel  really  dumb.  Sigh.  Not once at this "Disability" Seminar was the word accommodation even mentioned.  After being nauseous all day AND listening to that drivel, I went to the office for an additional 3 hours of work.  I'm so bored I'm putting in extra hours...  Well, that's about all the consciousness I can stream for one night.  I have to be counseling in 8 hours and I haven't even gotten the school to give me permission yet.  Tomorrow's going to be one of those days.  Until next time...
