You'll so feel like strangling the teachers at times ya?!! However, you'll stil need them to stay alive to teach ya til after ur O's, so.. let's just keep them alive for a lil while longer. Geex~ So stressing lei! As those freakin school days pass by like that, I feel as though I'm getting lesser and lesser air to breathe day by day.Never have I thought that studying would be so DAMN tough! I'm still struggling to hang onto the rope that the teachers are leading. I'm sure you know what that means. Especially for anything to do with math and science. Gosh~ How I wish these two subjects does not exist. Errrmxx.. I was so stressed today especially during my E math period today. I do not realli haf any clue why, but I do know that it's partly because of all the teachers trying to rush like a 'bullet train' in the topics they're teaching. Oh manx~ I'm trying real hard manx. I know my results sucks. [And that's also why I'm in S.S.S] But to me, it's really a waste of time you know! I'd rather come home and study and revise on my own and I can even call for help at times. Not like in school. I don't really know why but it seems like i have more mood to study at home than in school. [Don't ask me why!] It's just that I'm lazy in nature, like a pig! Heheee~ Hmmm... By the way, Racial Harmony Day is coming. Hope to see many people in their different yet own unique and original traditional costumes! Hahahax. Happy Racial Harmony Day! [In advance]
