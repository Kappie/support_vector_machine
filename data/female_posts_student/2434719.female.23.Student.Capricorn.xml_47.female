ME   in an effort to spice up the blog atmosphere, i released way too much carbon dioxide and methane and now we have a large gap---no more links and quotes!   I will refrain from using aerosole, farting, and driving my car until this void is full again.   it's only noon and i've already gone two places. now that is what i call productivity. heh heh. this morning i woke my lovely friend kristin up at 8, and then i headed out the door to the doctor's office to get some lab work done.  they were vampires. the nurse took eight, yes EIGHT things of blood. geeeeze.  and i couldn't pee for the pee test (too much pressure), so i was given a TO-GO pee cup.  i've never heard of that before!  i still havn't peed... normally i would have peed 20 times, but it's the pressure of HAVING to go.   after the pee-fiasco, i went to an interview for a job next semester. it's a small job, but it will be alot of fun for me (i hope) and a way to make a few extra bucks. we'll see if i get it.  now... the library. yes, i must go back. and it's a BEAUTIFUL day too, which makes me sad.  the final i had last night was alot harder than i thought it would be, and that makes me nervous... but i can't stress AFTER i take it, that just doesn't make sense.   OH GET THIS. this is how spacey i was after losing all the blood. i came home, got in the shower, and DID NOT REALIZE that i was still wearing my bra. who does that?? i could tell something was off, i just couldn't tell i needed to TAKE IT OFF.  good god. get me out of here, i'm losing it! no more studying, i need my social life back so i can be a normal person!! this time next week, i'll be human again.  JUST NOW i told newman "i like to eat places." that doesn't make any sense.  maybe it will take a little longer than a week to get back to normal :)
