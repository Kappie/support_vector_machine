Same song different chorus   It's stupid, contagious  To be broke and famous Can someone please save us from punk rock 101 My Dickies, your sweat bands My spiked hair, your new Vans  Let's throw up our rock hands for punk rock 101  She bought him a skateboard, a rail slide, his knee tore He traded it for drums at the local pawn shop She left him for staring at girls and not caring When she cried because she thought Bon Jovi broke up  Same song second chorus  Don't forget to dely...on the very last word  Seven years later he works as a waiter She married a trucker and he's never there The story never changes, just the names and faces Like Tommy and Gina they're living on a prayer   Did you just say that?  I said  It's stupid, contagious (same song different chorus) To be broke and famous (same song different chorus) Can someone please save us from punk rock 101 My Dickies, your rock hands My spiked hair, your new Vans  Let's shoplift some sweatbands for punk rock 101   so later days             MEH
