It's like driving on a winding road at night, there are lights in front of you and behind you, leading you forward into the darkness and revealing where you've been.  But every so often the road curves and for just a moment you lose sight of both.  For that short time you are both awed and scared.  Awed because what is around you is so beautiful, so seemingly calm and peaceful, but scared because you are alone and can't tell what's ahead.  For those few moments you have nothing but the thoughts in your head and the music in your CD player to keep you company.  The thoughts in my head lately have echoed the road.  I'm alone.  I can be surrounded by people, surrounded by noise and light, but I still feel like I'm on that road, watching, waiting, but distinctly alone.  But more than simply being alone, I feel it, a yearning, a sense of my loneliness.  I don't know why, particularly since lately I've been more social, more friendly, more flirtatious, but I am, I am lonely.  Can it be the apathy, my acceptance that the year is ending, that we will all be moving into separate lives?  Or is it more, is it deeper than that?  I am choosing to look at this feeling as temporary, that pretty soon the road will line up again and I will catch sight of someone else, but what if I'm wrong?  What if the road is perfectly straight and simply deserted?  What if I'm lost?
