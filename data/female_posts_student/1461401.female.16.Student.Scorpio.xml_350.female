       
      I want to go for a bike ride, would you come with me? Now. The darkness is delicious, and that's why I want to go now. I want to go fine a dark little spot to sit and think. I want to race through the allies decorated with twinkling stars and glide down moonlit paths, or sit in some dark garden and smell the forgotten scents of the day passed. To find someplace to call my own until the dawn comes and the sun reclaims it, that is what I would do.  Would you come with me?    (thank you so much ben for calling me tonight, it was wonderful to hear from you again!)
