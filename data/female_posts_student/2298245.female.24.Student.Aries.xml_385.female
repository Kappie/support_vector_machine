I submit to you the evidence:  On Wednesday - ironically, the same day that my friend and her friend were going to see it without me because of the pile of work I had to do (boo for work!) - I found the following passage while dutifully doing my Administrative Law reading for my evening class:   President James Garfield is reputed to have complained, "[e]very time I make an appointment I create nine enemies and one ingrate."  Then he was killed by a disappointed office-seeker.  Few stories about the civil service can compare.   Then, today, there is this gem from  urlLink Best of the Web :   For some reason, gratuitous Abu Ghraib references keep popping up in movie reviews. Maybe film critics wish their editors would allow them to review "adult" movies as well as normal ones.   The Dallas Morning News's critic manages to work Abu Ghraib into a review of "Garfield: The Movie," a PG-rated biopic: "At this point we're really rooting for Garfield to save Odie. But in the creepiest of the film's questionable turns, Garfield manages to get the electric collar fastened to the bad guy's neck. Then Garfield sends electrical currents charging through him. Yes, in a world where recent news about the torture of prisoners appalls, kids are supposed to cheer as the fellow writhes in agony. And then Garfield zaps him again."  Of course, the movie concludes unhappily for Garfield, who is fatally shot by a disgruntled job-seeker. Yeah, we know, we should have warned you a spoiler was coming, but we figured anyone who saw "Arthur" back in 1981 already knows how the prequel turns out.   This is not to mention that there's a  urlLink new movie about Samuel Byck .  Or that Amazon lists the  urlLink release date of the new cast recording as July 27 .  Anyway, folks, given the immense pressure that I am under to see the show again (and especially since I never told the world about it here - yes I am aware that in using the word "world" to describe my audience I have vastly shrunk the size of the world) by forces beyond my control, it would seem just plain wrong to resist.  So try I will - and hope that all those pesky Tony wins don't make it difficult to get tickets.
