They've been really weird now, no deaths as of late, but the little shadow figure is still there. He makes himself other people. Like the other day I was a fugitive and he was the lead detective of the FBI, chasing me down. No death, no guns, but something about the pursuit was foremost weird, with an undertone of haunting.  I believe I resolved yesterday's mystery, but I can't be certain.  Somehow I became lead plot designer and an actor for the video project. I hate it, having a talent with voices, I can just hear them and do it, I can assimilate any situation somehow...of course, this time, it screwed me over. Having to write plotlines and whatnot.  And lastly, the God story is coming along just nicely, and wonderfully sacreligiously. Just wait til I get to the Jesus part, I'll bet a few of you will stop reading.  Happy April all.
