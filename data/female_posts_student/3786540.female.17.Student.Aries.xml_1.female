I mean come on, where does he get off. he tells me he loves me more and more every time he sees me. Yeah that really truthful he loves me that much that he decides to fuck wit my head for the last month we were dating and even though he still got wit me and bought me flowers and stuff he was doing the same for one of my friends and what about Sarah, she should have come up and confronted me. I told her that when she had one of her many miscarriages I was the one who skipped many classes just to go wit her to see the school counselor. I even made an appointment and arranged a lift for her to go to clockwork but then she comes clear and says that all these miscarriages she has been having were all lies. I really didn’t know enough on the topic of miscarriages. I really didn’t know how hard it was for someone to have one let alone seven. it would have to be seriously deformed for it to end in a miscarriage. she lied about having a miscarriage wit her ex to get close to lance that’s y lance was spending so much time wit her and once she had him comforting her they were soon fucking. god damn them both. it just makes me angry how much I trust some people and they just fuck around wit me. she has no friends at school I was a semi friend of hers all my friends told her to fuck off I said nah let her sit wit us a few lunchtimes. but now wheneva I see her we all say slut and she goes to the library and does work. but how am I meant act. I know what we r doing now is mean but I don’t understand. how am I meant to treat her? I tried to be friends but then she just takes my b4 and when she does she doesn’t even tell me about it he was the one that told me after a month. they should have told me when it all first happened. and now lance is talkin to me and wants me to meet up wit him tomorrow he wants too make up for fucking me around so much and he wants to be friends. what should I do? should I forgive them?
