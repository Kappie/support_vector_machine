I suppose that what truly angers me is the fact that everyone seems to deceivingly put up a show of happy-go-roundness at all times. It's not real. Why hide what's there? I don't understand.  Of course, I have had my negative experiences with it to make me despise it, too, but then I somehow learned that I shouldn't attempt to comform to set standards simply to appease hypocritical views anyway. If they can't understand, it doesn't matter. They likely weren't meant to anyway, at that point.    Closed mindedness. I'm very likely faulty of this myself, but I have no tolerance for deliberately conscious closed mindedness. What's with the box, dude?   Disrespect for one's own mind.  So, one really admires something but denies it so as to agree with someone else in order to please them. And that? A no-no. Sincerely. Respect for one's own mind... ever heard of that?    Mah, I'm living up to the Darian aspect of myself, criticizing society down to the marrow and just wanting to complain about everyone and everything. But it's my blog, and it's a free country, so I can do this and go unharmed!!   Imagine that.   I'm just ranting as though I were a rampaging old hag, just smashing words down inconsequently and hoping that no one will ever bring this entry up to me, for that might not be a good idea.   Just GAH. GAH. GAH. GAH.         I hate this town, I hate this state, I hate this country, I hate this continent, and, quite frankly, I hate this planet! And maybe even this galaxy, too!!!
