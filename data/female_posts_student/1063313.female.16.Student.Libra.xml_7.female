Smith concert... everyone shoulda come cause it was awsome... i even made 5 bucks for screamin out "YOU ROCK BABY" 2 the chick who was singin,  patrick dared me 2 an her gave me 5 bucks for it... so i was happy. But then on our way out rodgers got lost... u would think a 10th grader could remember where we parked............. but he was on the other side of the building and was compleatly lost...... we were gonna call him but nobody knew his cell # so we got 2 groups of peeps out lookin for him an we finally found him... i was thinkin he got mugged or somethin cool but he was just lost :-( well i gotta go... cause i can smell spaghettii... and its like one of my favorite foods an knowin my family they will start eatin w/o me and that would really suck cause if i dont get in there fast i wont get 3rds or 4ths... so luv ya'll an ttyl
