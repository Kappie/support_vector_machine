I should have probably stayed at home and hid under the covers instead of hanging about and being miserable...  I wasn't miserable.....  just unable to focus.  I still can't focus, I've got too much running through my head to try and put it all down in words that will even briefly resemble something that makes sense.  Maybe I'll try later...
