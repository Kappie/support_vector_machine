I tried to make the best of it in spite of certain circumstances that i don't really want to talk about. Anyway, I bowled SO much and I got my all time high score! A 144! That's seriously like...so amazing for me. I even beat Justin and Justin's like...really good! YaY! fun times. i also played Alex at air hockey. I lost...but not by much!!! It was fun. I'm glad I went.  So, then I came home and got four hours of sleep and had to get up for my trumpet lesson. That was alright. I'm really not prepared for tomorrow. It's going to be really bad but that's ok. I don't really care. it's not like an audition or anything. bless Alex's cousin's heart though! She's accompanying me like...last minute and she was good at playing the song too! That's amazing because a lot of people that I talked to were like..."umm, it'd take too long to learn it." So, apparently, it's a really difficult piano part but Rachel knew how to play it! I was so happy. She's so good too and really really nice.   Anyway, after my lesson I went and slept for another hour. Then, I went for my interview at Jewel. Woo. I have a job. they say you're supposed to be really excited for your first job and yet...I feel like I'm entering the fifth circle of Hell...  Oh well, I need to go. Going over to Kathryn's house. Aweeeesommmeee! it should be fun. I love weekends where I get to spend time with like...all my groups of friends.   Oh yeah, one more thing, I ABHOR THIS SHIFT KEY!!!!!!!!!!!!
