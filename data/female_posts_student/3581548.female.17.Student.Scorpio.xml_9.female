At least til' August =) It's so good to be able to sleep it and not have to go through all the makeup  hair products to impress the whole student body haha.  My Piston's are losing by 8 to the  lakers !! seriously now. not cool. i hate the lakers. lol. Gosh, I hope Kanawha Central has a good team this year. they did last year, but their coach is gone this time around. that makes me sad...I miss Tommy.He's in for a while right now, and i've seen him twice. but i will see him again before he leaves for Germany.  I'm having ex-boyfriend problems. I gave him my heart long time ago, and i never really got it back. it's stupid of me to still have feelings for him, considering he shot me down and broke my heart. But i deserved it, so i don't know whyy i'm trippin. It's over and i realise that. It's just, everything we do, everything we talk about, somehow links to him. and it is taking the best of me. I can't go anywhere without seeing sumthing that me and him did together, or that we talked about or that we made fun of. It jus bothers me. ...It's my last summer before i graduate and get out on my own. I want to have fun with my friends and if there is a possibility for a summer fling, im ready to go! haha. i'm so weird. i know lol.  Awww... My really good guy friend Adam, just told me some really sweet things, here ill show you..           SCRudy369: you are a very beautiful girl with eyes to die for          SCRudy369: u are one of the top 10's          SCRudy369: and your body is amazing  isn't that sweet? haha. sorry it made my day. But speaking of sweet..my sister is outside with her boyfriend laying on a blanket in the yard lookin at the stars.  gag me`!!  jp.  well, i'm worn out. i'm goin to bed so i can lay out tomorrow morning/afternoon. I need sum sun. i'm tooooo pale haha   `m.i.s*
