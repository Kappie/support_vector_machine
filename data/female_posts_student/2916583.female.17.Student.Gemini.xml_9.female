I was just thinking - I gave myself a horrendous haircut (my mom's going to straighten it out later today).  I was massaging the shampoo in my hair, and I was thinking about A., and how he would look much better if he wore a little mascara to darken his long lashes, and then it hit me: what if the roles were reversed?  Anyway (I recently learned that anyways is not a word, and neither is irregardless - it's regardless ;D), I just wanted to write it down before I forgot it.  You know, it's nice having shorter hair.  I don't have to use as much conditioner, it takes a shorter amount of time to blow dry and straighten it (actually, I curl it at the ends; the minute amount of curl is usually gone by 1st period), and I can still wear my hair every way my mom said I couldn't wear it if I cut it shorter.  I can still braid it, wear it in a pony tail, curl it (although I slightly resemble my grandmother), put it in a bun, and wear a half ponytail.  Is it pony tail, ponytail, or pigtail?  Just wondering, why must we name hairstyles after animals?  Can't it be a tail?  News flash: since I don't want the psychos in the woodwork to go stalk the people in my life, I'm going to use first names or first letters when I'm talking about people.  For example, tomorrow, I'm going to ask my friend Ashley if she notices anything different - she'll stare at me for five minutes, then Monica will say, "Wait I think it's her hair."  Then she'll stare for another five minutes, and say, "I think you're right."  Then I'll grow tired of the charade, and tell them it's my hair.  The only sad thing about my hair is that I've lopped off most of the naturally blonde part.  My hair's hilighted from about an inch from the end up.  Speaking of which, I need to rehilight it; the roots look strawberry.    Apollo    urlLink   ?? Which Of The Greek Gods Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
