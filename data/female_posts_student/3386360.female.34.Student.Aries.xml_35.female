I've had weird calls the last couple of days where no one is there on the other line. I finally got tired of it and called the number back. There was a recorded song and I thought I had heard it before so I pulled up the mini file with the song. It was the same. Oh dear Goddess it was the same. Then I did a reverse directory number, no luck there the number is unlisted but it is in the same area code as AC home. Is it him trying to get ahold of me ? There is so much in my mind right now and I dont know what to think. I am going insane in a good way now. I have so many questions but I feel in my heart things are going to change. Goddess please let them change I gotta go.
