That totally blowed when I found out. Why should a man be put in jail for defending his daughter from her mom who is beating her? FUCKED UP!!! if you ask me!! She sucks...she'll get what she deserves though.  Got a new tounge ring today...rainbow. And it's plastic so it won't chip my teeth anymore thank goodness!! That was exciting. But they are expensive!! $15 for just one!! That's crazy dude.  I LOVE YOU ERICA!!! Just so everyone knows and so she knows! You are the best friend I could have! I am so glad you are in my life. You know I am here if you ever need me! You rock my world girl!  And I didn't get to talk to Kyle but for a minute today which made me sad! But I got to tell him good night. Which is all that matters I guess. Long as he knows I am always thinking about him. Even when I am being stupid!!
