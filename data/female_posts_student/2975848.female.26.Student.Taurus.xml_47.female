I feel so alone I am my own buddy. I feel so helpless There’s nothing you can do. I feel so selfish Why should I share my life? I feel so insane Never met myself in other way. I feel so abused I give all I got, in turn of nothing. I feel so ignorant Never know what is right or wrong. I feel so instable Never know my next move. I feel so ugly Sadness never was beautiful. I feel so bitchy As more I suffer, more I don’t care. I feel so guilt I don’t know what to do to change this way of livin’. I feel so dark My life colours, are vanishing. I’m fading black.
