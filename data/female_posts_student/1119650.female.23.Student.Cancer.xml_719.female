I'm not really sure where this post will go, but I'm just going to put up what comes to mind.     urlLink Becca  wrote a post, kindly, or not so kindly asking people to "STFU" and I laughed my butt off.  It was a much needed laugh, so, thank you for that.  Hehe.  I haven't had much of a chance to even read anyone else's blogs so I'll have to try and find some more time to do that (maybe after my lunch hour when everyone else is out of the office).  I got re-hired at  urlLink Starbucks  so I'm officially a full fledged  urlLink coffee wench  again.  My first shift is today after I'm done here at my first job (I'm going to be piggy backin' these 2 jobs for the next 12 business days, working from 8 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. M-Th...Needless to say I'm gonna be in an AWESOME mood).  It's going to be a pain to make it through, but I'll have some extra cash and I won't have any time to spend any of it so though it seems sucky it'll be beneficial in the long run.    This last weekend was a lot of fun, my friend  urlLink Billy (jk, dude)  had a party on Friday, so that was fun.  Saturday was the infamous "Duckapalooza" which was a lot of fun.  Andrew plays for a hockey team called the "Great Big Ducks" and at the end of every year the team has a party (hence the name).  It was great.  It was at this AMAZING house on the water and there was a jumpy castle, face painting, kegs, margaritas, incredible food, an ice cream man and just a ton of really nice, really cool people.  All guys from the hockey team and their wives and kids.  Bex and Todd came with us so it was cool.    I took off early and went up to Mahopac with Megan and Ashley.  We were supposed to go see one of Meg's friends, Greg, fill in with this band.  Unfortunately the owner of the bar (a fat drunk old mess) decided he didn't like the sound of the opening act (a mix of tool and korn sounds) so he didn't do the polite thing and ask them to stop playing (or even let them finish their set and just not ask them back), nope.  First he turned the jukebox on over them to try and drown them out, but they kept playing, and then he just walked over to them and turned the power off in the bar.  It was quite possibly the rudest thing I've ever seen in my life.  As if that wasn't lame enough, he called the cops and told them there was a fight at the bar (now for a bunch of 20somethings we were very calm) no one was screaming, no one was yelling, everyone was just chillin' and trying to be respectful, finish our drinks and then bounce.  So 12 cops roll into the bar expecting some sort of riotous environment and they find nothing.  So we all leave the bar and hung with the cops in the parking lot for a few minutes (they agreed the guy was a douche) and well, they were hot, so who were we to leave eye candy early?    Sunday Andrew I and went to brunch, which was quite yummy.  We sunned for a bit at my cousin's pool and watched the Butterfly Effect, and it wasn't quite the crapfest I was expecting.  It wasn't the greatest movie ever, and the ending sucked, but it was disturbing and not too bad, (even if it did have Ashton Kutcher in it).  It was still better than "Lost in Translation".  I think that's about it, so yeah that was cool.  I am so happy right now, not right this second per se, as I'm at work (boo!), but in general.  It scares me to say that 'cause I don't want to jinx any thing, but I can't remember being this satisfied with my situation as I am now in a long time.  I am surrounded daily by great, true friends, my family, an absolutely amazing boyfriend (with whom I become more smitten every day).  I'm doing things, I'm smiling, I'm taking care of what I have to get done and I'm finally almost dug out of this rut I have been in since I got dismissed from UConn four years ago.  To feel like the possibility for anything is out there is really exciting (wow that sounds hokey).  I dunno, I just needed to gloat a little because really, I don't think I've got much I can complain about.    Take care kiddies and I'll catch ya on the flipside!
