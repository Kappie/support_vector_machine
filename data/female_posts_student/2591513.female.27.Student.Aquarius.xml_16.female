They gave me the choice to have a dnc, or naturally and I thought I would try naturally.  I am still sore and overwhelmed, but I think I am coping with it okay.  I t hink having three other children in my life takes the edge off.  I think a little part of Ed and I wanted to believe that the baby was still there, just hiding...but with my hormone levels going down, it wasn't at all possible that the baby was still living.  Well it is late and I am tired and mentally drained.
