Though, I love the 'goth' scene. ^^;  Sense of humor? Of course! I want a guy that can joke around, and just be plain fun. But, I also want him to be serious when the time comes.   Protective? Definately, that is such a huge turn on for me. I don't want him to over protective and jealous, yet I don't want him to not give a damn either. The perfect balence, yet tilted more towards very protective.  Outgoing? I'm EXTREMELY shy.  I don't really like the outgoing type that much, they make me a bit uncomfortable. I'd want a guy that was shy, yet a bit more outgoing than myself.  Romantic? Totally. The whole roses and chocolates thing are a must. I'm the beach type, I love 'moonlight walks on the beach' That whole thing, I guess i'm just a dreamer and romantic like that.   Adventurous? That is an absolute MUST. I'm really adventurous myself.  Camp, fish, ride horses. You name it!  (Not everything, mind you.)   I'll add to this later.
