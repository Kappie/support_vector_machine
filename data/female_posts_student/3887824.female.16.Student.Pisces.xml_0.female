Now I'm doing school, which I have been for the past hour and a half. This is so cool. Yesterday I had a violin lesson which went well, then I went to the library. I checked out some books, also got a cd recording of Les Miserables, and a VHS of Pirates of Penzance. The audio and video are due back intwo weeks, the books in four. I think I'll bring at least some of the books to camp.   Vickie is coming in FIVE DAYS! YAY FOR YAY!   My days are more productive now. I'm not just sitting around anymore. Some things are weird, like getting used to the fact that I'm 16 and I have my drivers license (it's like, Whoa- how did this happen?) but I'm really happy now. I'm so moody, lol. Two days ago I was feeling really down (Hey, it happens), but now I'm not, and I have a feeling that I won't be for a while. The fact that I'm in a really good mood Pre-Camp is amazing, so imagine how I'll be while I'm there, and when I come home! Camp is so inspiring. I can't WAIT to see people.   School will continue to progress well now, and hopefully I can get a job soon. For a couple of weeks I was just not into anything, but things have turned around... so I am glad.   "YAY FOR YAY!" -Vickie. That pretty much covers it.  (Wow, this blog is so pointless, lol)
