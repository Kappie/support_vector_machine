(Don't worry, it'll be fair trade anti-globalist violence, nothing too drastic) *or sanatising* Hmm... sanatising... weird word. I mean it in the sanity way. (I wonder if I'd pass a shrink test?) I honestly think that no one would! We're just lucky cause no one's asked us to take it yet! *muhahaaa fools!* Uhh well not it my present state of mind. Actually... they'd probably put test questions on like: An old lady comes up to you in the street. Is she... a. following you with her rabies infested dog. b. brandishing a knife behind her back. c. not there, you're hallucinating again. d. margret *damn i'm proud at not being able to spell that!* thatcher and you're about to do some bodily harm to her because of it. e. asking what street this is so she can call the cops to come and get you. f. you're mum with your pills.  And... the catch-22 is... there are no sane results! Horrar!
