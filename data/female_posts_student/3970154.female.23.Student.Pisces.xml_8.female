We are often in the company of one  another, whether we like it or not. My life has always  been most rewarding to me so far, but this not because the  rest are not. But it is the most memorable I have yet  because I started active socialization. I made new  friends, and learnt how and where to get new friends. I  ran... and I fell... I started to realize that I have not    just have to constantly make new friends.... but I also      have to learn how to keep them..I began to see things  differently, from a more grown up point of view - not just  making and keeping any friends, but true friends. People  whom I can trust all my secrets with, people who can  provide listening ear, a shoulder to lean on, and a heart  to care...whenever you need them there...It was only then  did I realised that true friendship is indeed more  precious than all the diamonds in the world. It reaches  beyond time, and the true miracle is in giving, not  receiving. I also realised that we do not know what we  have got until we lose it, but it is also true that what  we have been missing out until it arrives...Once, I closed  my eyes and recalled all my dear friends faces.I realised  that they all all been like one of the shooting stars we  could seldom see in the New Zealand and Malaysia's night sky.      They had streaked across my life and lit up the darkness cos  without friends, our lives would be terribly empty they have    filled up a gaping hole in my life...thanks to all of you,    my friends, for filling up this hole in my life....   urlLink
