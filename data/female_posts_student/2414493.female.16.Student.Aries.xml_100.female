I am just so tired it's bad. lol. And there goes my word sense.  The only other intelligent thing--or things, actually--are tirades against fat people and a meditation on homosexual people. Neither of which you really want to hear.  Argh.  I'm okay, really...I don't mind what's going on around me, it's just that I'm tired and I have a lot on my plate and I just wish I had something to make this all feel better.
