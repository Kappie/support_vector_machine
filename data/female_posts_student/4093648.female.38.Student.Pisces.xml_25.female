I never thought about what would happen when one died. They shared a circulatory system so a doctor had agreed to separate them should one of them die.  Eng woke up one morning and discovered his brother dead. (Can you imagine?) The doctor didn't make it in time and Eng died some hours later. I wonder how he felt those last hours. He had had such an intimate existence with his brother that he probably didn't have the same creep out reaction the rest of us have thinking about being attached to a dead body. Was he more frightened? of dying? of the separation procedure? I should check the library for books about them.
