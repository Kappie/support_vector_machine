After moving downstairs in my building I have been as they say disconnected.  I missed the sweet smell, the nice feel of my darling computer.  School being finally over for the school year I can now go to work, while trying to enjoy life.  I am doing research on adverse events caused by medical error.  It is quite interesting, the literature research points out that more people die from medical error than from car accidents.  Makes you feel good.  Although it worries me I can see how complex care is, so many people involved that it is a miracle that no more mistakes occur.  However, I am sure we can do better.  As part of my work, I get to sit in on rounds.  It is so exiting.  Lady walks in with a swollen foot what is your approach to a swollen foot?  Men walks in with low salt what is your approach to low salt? (add cheetos maybe?)  But in all seriousness it is really interesting despite the fact that it occurs at 8 AM and that it is not mandatory for my work.  I canâ€™t wait until next year for me to start doing these things or thinking of my approach to different problems.  There are some interesting moments where I can laugh at what goes on, for example one doctor was discussing a huge testicle and to demonstrate the size of the appendage he used his hands to show the volume and describe his own volume  as a normal reference point to further our education.
