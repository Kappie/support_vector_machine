Today was a good day.  Took my best friend to Best Buy to get a new computer.  She knows nothing about computers and insisted on getting something prepackaged and ready to take home.  She expected she'd pay around $800.  I was like, "Gee, do you know you can get something for much less and it will perfectly suit your needs?"  She didnt care.  She wanted it NOW and so what if it has 160 mb of RAM.  She'll use it all up for sure.  mmhmm.   And no, I wont take the 3 year parts and services warrantee for another $100.  I think I can do this myself.  Wait...it doesnt come with Microsoft Office?  That's HOW much more??   RIGHT.    SIGH.  I may not know that much about computers but I do know when someone knows less than me.  I love her, but I hate the fact that she never listens to me.  Like, NEVER.  Maybe its my approach?  SIGGGH.  It was nice hanging out with her and her boys, even though they were about to have a shitfit in the store if we didnt leave when they'd had enough of mommy shopping.  And speaking of the boys, Steve had  his  boys over.  The Dungeons and Dragon's gang.  It was so cute to watch them talk about orcs, bards, clerics, ogres and the like as if it were totally and completely for real.  I cant wait till they come back.  I cant say enough how adorable they are!  Makes me want to have kids. (yes, I know EVERYTHING makes me want to have kids) but its that same sense of play and pretend, that sense of adventure that we lose as adults that they still are able to let out once in awhile.  A-DOR-A-BLE!!  Oh, and honey I was very proud that everyone enjoyed your adventure!  Go you!
