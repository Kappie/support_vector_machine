He says he isn't but he won't admit his weakness that he is stressed, frustrates me, I love the bastage and can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him, if it works it does, if it doesn't well can't say we didn't try.  Well it's the fourth of July, and later on today I plan on going to the park with him hehe, and we are going to have a couple friends come down to the bbq we are having, then It's off to watch a fireworks show.
