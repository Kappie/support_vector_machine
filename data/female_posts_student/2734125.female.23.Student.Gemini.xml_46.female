I watched the fire eating flesh of wood, never thinking, utterly contained in its knowledge of self.   I picked at the melted burn holes in the carpet, wished for hard wood floors because they always remind me of light.   There is always a moment in winter when it feels like death and cold have stretched on forever.  It may come the second day, or the second to last, and it may stay a week, or only a few seconds- but it comes.  It is a reserved acceptance of mortality, a clenching of the stomach and a final resignation to the cycles which are beyond us.  No super human can fly forth, and put out their hand, and stop the biting wind that steals glowing thoughts.  It slips around them, gets up under their cape from the back, hits their neck in a lovers touch and drains their powers to dust and snow.   Sweat freezes, and we are dark.   Its when everything is painted primer grey, and no amount of tea or hot house flowers will flush you.  Maybe lovers are immune, drinking in the pheromone scents of another long night that was too short.    Last night, after my mind flew far, I ended up missing all my dream classes, and I was so far behind, and I had to take care of these kids, who were cool, but I was late again to class and once was alright but after that, was I failing and I was lost, all the buildings and the corners and distracting moments of chaotic people talking in a car, but campus is back that way, and where are we going, there is something I need, no books and I'm not ready.   You can imagine my relief when I woke up.   But more then escaping an escapade of stress I was glad to see blue sky dripping through the wind bent branches, as I looked upside down at the sky from my pillow.   The fabric of winter is rough on my skin, like sacking made into a punk-rock shirt, its out of fashion and was never that hot to start with.   Wrap me in long arms and soft cotton that's worn thin like a second skin of silk.   I want to be held, my head comfortable with no moments, listening to a quiet heart beat that speeds as I shift in to an eye snapping moment of connection.   Then it can shift, all focus tied into a finger brushing carefully back a loose hair, into the crux behind my ear and lingering moments where the ridges of this finger never touch my cheek, but the molecules rub magnetic fire into my neurons.   Utterly here, no where but in this one breath of time, pulling in all my satellite thoughts to feel one moment of purity.   On my alter there are moons that hang like blue perfect fruit, and there are sacrifices tied in bundles of woven flax and string died by sunsets.   On my alter there are a thousand sighs, and moments of praise that glow from their mahogany box.   There is a velvet cushion that is deep red, and it is to watch and pray on, but there are sharp pebbles that appear sometimes and dig into unwary flesh.   There, on my alter, are a hundred weapons waiting to be called on, and only one perfect flower that changes with the light.   Moonstones pave the path which lead to caverns that are dark and earthy.  Sand grits into your shoes or socks if you are foolish enough to wear them, and you can walk into an endless black that has no shadows.  In this cave the only thing that you can hear is your true voice, and the only thing you can see is your true self, and few survive its hollow drumming.   On my alter there is a spider that lives in the eyes of a statue, and she weaves answers to questions, and then feeds them to her babies.   There is water that shimmers with sparks of life, life water from bays in the Caribbean, sweetly salty.   Everything there is dangerous and healing, trying and teaching, and nonsensical and at times silly.   Time to get back.
