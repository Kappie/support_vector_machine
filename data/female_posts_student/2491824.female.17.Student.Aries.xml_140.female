Anyway, my dad, stepmom and I went to a fooking car show... :/  While we were there I had a sandwich and they had BBQ chicken... So we were all full...  Then we went back to my dad and stepmom's house and watched the first part (of 4) of  Shogun ... Everyone involved in the making of that movie should be shot... It was horrible... But it allowed me to have decent nap... after the movie finished... my dad was the only one hungry, so we didn't go out to dinner as we had planned to do...    ....And everyone here has left to go out to dinner.... but Bill (my mom's b/f person) is going... and I absolutely hate him... so... I'm suck at home by myself on my birthday  :(  But, I've already gotten $130 bucks for my birthday.. I'm thinking about putting that all--plus the $20 bucks that I already had-- towards a digital camera..  ...But, If I'd just smiled and nodded, I would have one now... My dad said he was thinking of getting one for me for my birthday, but I had said that I wanted a 5 megapixel camera... Stupid Ashley! ...A 3.3 megapixel (which is what he recently got himself) would have done fine! .....stupid me...  I'm thinking about maybe auditioning for  Much Ado About Nothing  tomorrow... I don't know if I really want to though... ..And if I happened to get a part, I'd have to manage being in that and doing sound for  To Kill A Mockingbird .  Bah, I have to start going to rehearsals for  Mockingbird  next week.... At least I'll be doing sound by myself, that makes it so much better.... :)
