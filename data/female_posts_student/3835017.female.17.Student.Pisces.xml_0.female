She's about 5'5" tall and is rather lean. She wears a brown leather tubetop and a low-cut leather skirt with gold circles embedded throughout the hem, gheta sandals, and her hands, forearms, feet, and lower legs are wrapped in bandages. Accessory-wise, she sports a brown leather choker-thing, two arm-things that are tied by a leather wrapping on the left arm and her hitai-ate around her right arm, a pair of earrings that are like two spiked mace-balls, and a triangle tattoo-design underneath her left eye. She is always surrounded by a mischevious and upbeat air, which adds to the sparkle of her natural youth. Also, she also lives very animatedly, so she sports a rather tomboy-ish impish look to her.  For a better picture, check out http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/8790233/ .  Personality: Dango is a very animated and lively individual. When she was little, she was very attentive, quiet, and obeyed her grandmother, the matriarch of the clan, very well. However, after recent tension, Dango decides to live her own life and sprints down the other path. Now, she is a very open individual who lives for herself and for those who she respects. She judges people by their actions done in their presence, not by rumors. She's loud and honest, like Naruto, but won't bluntly challenge everyone in a room like he did during the first test in the chuunin exam...^-^; She's a partier and loves to have fun, often setting aside her studies to get a kick out of life. However, she is a very feisty person and gets extremely nasty really fast once you piss her off.She goes psychotic at this point, though not to the point of Tsuyu, and doesn't calm down until her goal is either complete or until she's knocked out.  History: When she was a baby, a man named Anzai found her in a muddy ditch and took her home with him to be raised by the Kobarashi clan. During her childhood years, her grandmother Ibana, who was the clan matriarch. insisted that she train Dango herself and, when the tactician master Anzai insisted on teaching tactics, refused and explained that Dango must grow up to be a woman and study the geisha arts instead of grow up to be a brutish tomboy. She was kept inside until she just turned 8, and then was just allowed to go to the academy. Because of this seclusion, the only thing that she knows about the Kyubi incident was that a demon was "looking for a princess" and she had to stay inside; she has no idea of the fourth Hokage's existence.  Right before her ninth birthday, she became a gennin and only got a month in before her grandmother became ill and needed her help at home. For five years, as Dango tended to her grandmother, Anzai taught her how to blend her geisha skills her with his tactician training while keeping her in shape through strength training and yoga. When she was 14, her adoptive father left for a peace mission and never came back, leaving Dango with Ibana. It was then that Ibana really got mean, blaming her son's disappearance and his change in personality all on her. Here was when Ibana let Dango know in a rather cross way that Dango wasn't a part of the family and that she was just some whelp found in a ditch. Hearing this, Dango freaked out, rampaged through the house, grabbed her things, and stormed out of the house, changing her clan name from Kobarashi to Garakuta, which means 'odds and ends'.   At 14, Dango moved into a small apartment blessed through child welfare, and joined up with Master Satu's cell, starting her new life as Garakuta Dango.   * I am so sorry if this is unclear and sloppy!
