This morning I felt okay, except that I was very not happy that the clothes I put in the dryer last night weren't dry in the morning... so I threw something on... felt very unpretty today. And I felt stuffy. All and all it was a down day. After school was Art Club's first meeting, 10 people.. woo. Sounds like I'm gonna be teaching half of them how to paint. (...) Today was Wednesday which is me-and-charlotte movie day... I felt really lightheaded and headachey so I went home after watching an hour or so of Vh1. When I got home I tried in vain for ten minutes to vanquish a huge fly from my room, but eventually I prevailed and he now lies dead and squished on my windowsill. Ew. I should probaby do something about that. But yeah... and then I slept... and I just got up... I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight. Fuck. But maybe I won't go to school tomorrow.  Hm... I'm getting another haircut from someone good (=more expensive... :| ) but I probably have to cut it short again... not like pixie-cut short but.. pretty short... Makes me mad because I spent so long growing it out and then that stupid asian lady just ruined it. Gr! Bout to pop some caps. But yeah right now I feel like crap and I'm gonna zone in front of the tellay now.
