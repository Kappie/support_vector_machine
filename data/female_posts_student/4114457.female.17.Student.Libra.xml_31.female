I mean, I can see myself there for a little while. All we did was work on a big packet of math problems.... hmmm, sounds like regular school. Not only that, the answers were on the bottom of the pages. Whatever, at least Courtney and Melanie were in the class with me. It will be over Thursday. After class, we all went to hang out at the mall and get dinner. We also picked up Brian, which was a good thing since I don't see him very often anymore. Ever since he started working again, I feel kinda lonely. But I know he loves me, and we will find a way to see each other! Anyway, he is on the phone with me now so I am gonna go talk to him now. ~Peace~
