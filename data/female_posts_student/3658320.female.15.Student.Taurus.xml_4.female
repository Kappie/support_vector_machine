SO yea...everyone is on vacation..like DANI! whos in myrtle beach! i'm jealous! and then like i havent had anyone to talk to! aj went to the movies w/ his mom today and now hes at tylers for the nite! so i have no one to talk to! but then i gotta wake up at 10 tom and take a shower and then go to a soccer game at noon! so yea..hope its not too cold out there! I also havent talked to my bestest friend in a long time..tasha! She moved down to arkansas and i havent talked to her..i hate situations where you have to lose one of ur very close friends cause ur moving or they move away! It's really hard..i had to do that when i moved up here from lousiana! and then tasha just left me.. people just then grow farther and farther apart.  Last summer w/ her was so fun..nice memories at that park by her house w/ 2 unnamed guyz.. but yea..well i think i'm gonna go back on aim rite now or go upstairs and watch tv! bye bye for now!
