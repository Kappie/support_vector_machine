So anyway, oh yeh and it was a good thing that you guys told me to go home cos i threw up again this afternoon. so thankyou. ahhhhhh it was soooo annoyin, by the time i got home i felt rather shitty and then realised i did'nt have a key. sooo i trailed my way to grove to get my mums key and then trailed home again. by which time i was close to the point of collapsing. but it was sooooo funny cos this person who was in there front garden must have got seriously freaked out cos i walked past there three times and they were still there! believe me it was funny at the time. anyway why were you scared? did anythin happen today at school? did you get any homework?  so....yeh you guys can still come round on sunday but i probably should'nt do anythin tomorrow just in case i feel worse and you guys will all end up covered in spew. lovely huh?. why this an incredibly long blog...well for me anyway. hee hee. so wheres lynne these days? she has'nt blogged for like, sixty million years. and you say i dont blog enough.  see ya dudes
