"I'm always here for you" "yea" why, why can't he see that I'm there for him? she has that running through her head, and wishes that things would finally work out for him. she hopes that sometime soon, God will look down on him and Smile really big. she sees that he's struggling, and that she can't do anything but be there for him, and hug him, and tell him things will work out. she believes it too, because even though he doesn't realize it, he is a beautiful and strong person. and she feels bad when she runs to him, in shambles, when his problems rise above her petty insignificant situations. and she gets scared when, she knows that she might never see him again.  fin.
