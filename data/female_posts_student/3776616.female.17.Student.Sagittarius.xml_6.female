Beth and I went to see Robert for a few minutes so we could talk to him about parties, then we put some stuff in his car and I got Burger King, then we went back to Lainie's. Jamie, Missy, and Jim stopped in, then Jamie came back later on and hung out w/ us until Lainie closed. She took us on a Happy Smoke walk, which surprised me, b/c I thought she despised me w/ every ounce of her being, and you don't share w/ people you hate. But she had a sweet ass one-hitter that looked like a cigarette. Beth got fucked up, b/c she's a lightweight. I just felt good, which was nice. And I got cotton mouth, but that's easy to deal with. Anyway, while Lainie was closing I talked to Race for awhile. He was listening to Jamie and Beth arguing about whether Alaska was part of the continental U.S. That was pretty funny. Anyway, then Jamie, Beth, and I sat there talking until 9:30ish, I dropped Jamie off, then we went back to Beth's. Sat in her living room until 10, then went over to Robert's. Decided to go to Perkin's, and that was fun (of course). When we got back Andy was at Robert's. I walked in the door first, and Andy thought I was Robert so he jumped out from behind the couch and screamed. OMFG he scared the shit out of me... Anyway, we sat and talked at Robert's for awhile. Richie called, and he was drunk, so Andy turned his phone on speaker so we could all hear it. Then around 11:45 Andy and Robert went to Kwik-Trip, and I walked Beth home then went home.   On another random note -- I haven't talked to Ken since Saturday, other than texts Sun and Mon. And surprisingly it hasn't bothered me at all. Like before, if I went 2 or 3 days w/o talking to him, I'd be depressedish and miss him a lot. I still miss him, of course, and I want to talk to him and see him and whatnot, but I'm just so so so happy that it's not bothering me anymore. Like, big step for me kinda thing. I really do think that this two weeks of not seeing each other is going to help A LOT.   But yeah, I'm gonna go shower so I can leave soon. Later!
