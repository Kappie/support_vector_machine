Funny how it works. Envious of others all the time. No matter what you say i guess theres always a twinge of jealousy in me.. unless u talk about me.. good things that is. Im finding myself to be more and more self centered by the minute.. i sure hope u dont notice.. and if u do i mite just have to shoot you.
