I love goin there I always leave feelin relaxed and content. Though, today I read something that kinda freaked me out but it only made me realize how short life is. So then, I found these two books "Who Moved My Cheese" and "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens" they seemed like really good books so I got them and then Erica called and asked I was doin anything, I told her no, so I made plans to go to the movies witha all them. So Erica and Melanie picked me up and we went to go see "Scary Movie 3" with Debra, John, Stasi, Jay, Rob, and Ruben. It was okay, the movie wasn't too bad. Then we went to Woodrow Diner to get something to eat and then we went to Ruben's house and hung out there till about 11:30. It was fun I hadda really good time and we were talkin in the car (me, Ez, and Melly) and we were like "Yea, I hate when guys like open up and get all emotional and when you seem to be the man in the realtionship." and how "Farrell guys seem to be the most emotional for some reason, like all of them are just WAY too sensitive and adoring. Being around testosterone all day must be the reason"... it was funny. I felt bad for Scott lol. So yea... now I'm gonna chill out and go to sleep in a little bit cause I gotta get up early and go rake Clove Lakes park for next week. Peace x0x
