Ok here are the lyrics: Hilary Duff-So Yesterday (So yesterday) (So yesterday) (So yesterday) You can change your life (If you wanna) You can change your clothes (If you wanna) If you change your mind Well that's the way it goes But I'm gonna keep your jeans And your old black hat ('Cuz I wanna) They look good on me You're never gonna get them back At least not today Not today Not today, 'cuz If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday So yesterday I'm just a bird That's already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday So yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay You can say you're bored (If you wanna) You can act real tough (If you wanna) You could say you're torn But I've heard enough Thank you You've made my mind up for me When you started to ignore me Do you see a single tear It isn't gonna happen here At least not today Not today Not today, 'cuz If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday So yesterday I'm just a bird That's already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday So yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay If you're over me, I'm already over you If it's all been done, What is left to do How can you hang up,If the line is dead If you walk out, I'm a step ahead If you're movin' on, I'm already gone If the light is off, Then it isn't on At least not today Not today Not today, 'cuz If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday So yesterday I'm just a bird That's already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday Haven't you heard you're so (yesterday) If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday So yesterday I'm just a bird That's already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday So yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay  here is my comment: Ok if you were that guy wouldn't you be like "Bitch, give me my stuff back." and also probably "Stop leaving creepy messages on my machine"  but mainly what I'm getting from this song is that she's really just a clepto.
