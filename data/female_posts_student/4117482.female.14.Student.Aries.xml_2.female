I asked if he wanted to do something tonight, but he said he was going to Stuart's which was fair enough. He was nice enough to ask Stuart if it was okay if I came. Then I made the mistake of asking "Do you even want me to come?" he said "I'm not bothered".... YOU DO NOT say that to me. It hurt a lot, but he obviously didn't realise. Quickly I told him I had to go, and him talking to me on msn just gave me the impression that I was getting dumpe.So what do I do when I'm upset? Put on some Dashboard, straighten hair and cry :( It does help.      Later on I called Paul, this is when I found out we couldn't go to Stuarts anymore. Would he have even called if I hadn't have called him? Doubtful. Oh, I forgot to say, the other night I asked if I was clingy and he said "It does get annoying, you kissing me all the time" *shocked* ,well you won't be getting any loving from me boy! Anyway, when I phoned him I think he realised I was upset. He was a tad nicer to me, and I realised that he was probably only kidding, it made me feel much better. Although I must admit, I think he's going to dump me! Maybe I'm paranoid! After the phonecall, Amy phoned! So I went down to her's for a bit, we prankied people, including Paul! It was good fun!:) Made me feel a little better ;) .Got home just after 11,keeping in mind I had work the next day (amn't I a clever cookie). Lying in my mum's bed, where I decided to sleep cause I felt like it! Just thought about the day, i'm awefully good at getting upset over nothing! From now on I've got to be less paranoid, that was my thought for yesterday....didn't really work though! Today's been dull, just there my best friend's dad came in. That's about as exciting as my day gets. If you're wondering, Amy's dad is an account...hence why he was here! He was laughing at me cause I'm on msn :) I better go, y'now...work to do *rolls eyes* Peace And Empathy Love and Huggles Rhona xxx
