We'll probably just be sitting around bored out of our minds the entire time.  Oh well. Ha. Hopefull we'll have a good time though. I really hope so. I'm kind of nervous. She hasn't been over here in  AGES  and I haven't seen her in SO long. I felt this way before seeing her the last time, at the Cheerleading Competion thing (I'm not a cheerleader, it was the only event that I could see her at). But I wasn't feeling as nervous this time until she said she was nervous. I didn't think she'd be nervous but now that she is I am way more nervous.
