Because my parents never pay our bills, unless I happen to remind them, or the electric or summat gets shutoff. *sigh* Dad just went down...of course had a fit. I can't wait to leave...at least with Stephanie I'm not stressed out about every little thing, and I'm alot happier. Ever since we met in fourth grade, when I came as a new student, we haven't been away from each other for more than a week...but that was just because of our yearly vacation (which always sucks..). Otherwise, we go to the park about every 2 days lol. To do nonsense stuff like...hehe...nevermind.           I have six bucks or so, and I wanted to give mom all that, if she payed for the rest of this movie I want at Barnes and Nobles. Queen of the Damned. Wow that is the BEST movie ever! Anyone seen it?? I loove it. Sadly, we are too busy this weekend. Oh well, I can wait.           *thinks* This was a rather pointless entry, but w/e. I just got on to say that I'll write sometime later on tonight about how it went, and it ended up being all this. hehe. Well, comments people! :D Toodles!      ~*Blessed be*~
