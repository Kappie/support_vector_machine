Weather: Heavy rain.     *~RANDOM THOUGHTS~* Relationships are funny things. Different people do things differently. Take, for example, my father. Him and his girlfriend, Mary, moved in together after only a month. She told me only this morning that she still can't believe how fast she fell for my dad.  I never understood it. My relationship at the time was...Well, looking back on it, we both wanted completely different things. I didn't get pregnant on purpose - I had my whole life planned. Finish my A-Levels, go to Uni to study Eng Lit and Creative Writing. And I definately didn't and don't want that asshole around me for the rest of my life. Which he won't be. He can take me to court if he wants access.   Until I met David. We've been together a month, and if he asked me to run away with him and get married, I would do it. If he asked me to move in with him today, I would do it. We've spoken about both of these things, and when I find a house/flat to rent, (my Unc's been considering renting me his house) David will be moving in with me.    *~RANT OF THE DAY~* Emily again. She wanted to talk to me to sort things out. Sorry hunni, the only thing we need to sort out is whether or not you can accept that David and I are together or not. And you can't. Told her I am not intrested in anything that she has to say. Then she started getting petty saying she wanted her mini discs back and that I owe her money. Yeah, right. She's got her mini discs and she will be satisfied with that.   I think she realises just what a good friend she has lost, because once you are in my close circle of friends, it is very rare that you drop out of it. I'm loyal, will defend you to the death, and never be 2 faced, or lie, or cheat, or steal...  MUST DO: Go in bath. Wash hair. Make dinner.
