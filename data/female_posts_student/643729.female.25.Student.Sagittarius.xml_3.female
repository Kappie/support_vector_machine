Shane came in when he got up (around 7am) nand snuggled in bed with me after asking to have Blue's Clues put on. Now keep in mind when I first wake up in the morning my eyes are stuck shut because of weeping due to allergies. I have memorized the remote and the keystrokes required to get to said show so I am ok. So we watched B.C. then found Noggin (one of the best kids networks on cable T.V.) and were watching that. Actully let me be honest, Shane was watching, I was listening! Then it becomes about that time to get up and out of bed and face the day. We all get dressed and ready to head out the door to school. "Where are my keys?" I ask. No response. "WHERE ARE MY KEYS?!?" Then I get the famous, "I didn't have em. Nic/Alexys/Shane had them." Now the name blamed depends on who I ask. "Well, FIND MY KEYS!!" I yell. It then becomes obvious that we are not going tomake it to school today because the couch monster has swallowed my keys. I send Shane in for a nap, and instruct Alexys and Nic to keep looking. They are finally found in a basket of folded clothes destined for Nic's room. By then it is too late to go to shcool and I am getting hungry. We have lunch and get the rest of the clean clothes sorted and folded. I was at least productive today!! Cut to us, 7 hours later trying to leave and go to the laundry mat. Same senario only this time my wallet has disappeared as well. GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRR. Kids! We find them relatively quickly this time and off the the mat we go. Utter and total chaos there. Kids running, spinning each other in the baskets/rolling carts, buying 7 cans of soda after they sneak into my wallett and get the change I just got for the machines. We got it done and came home and here I sit recalling my day. I did have a good conversation with Jo. She is my youngest son's aunt. Thank god she is a part of our lives again. I love talkign to her and hearing about all the madness over at the donor's house. Makes me feel good about that fact there they have had no influence until recently. Well, off to call my best friend, Dale, and watch newlyweds. I hope I didn't miss it!  TTFN B
