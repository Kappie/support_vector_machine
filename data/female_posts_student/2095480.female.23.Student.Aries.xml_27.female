Its so much more than you ever wanted to know. Anyway, I'll be done with this on Saturday after the  FSE ... for about a day, then its back to class.   Alot of good stuff going on for me.    I'm doing a presentation called  "Persuasive Elements in Music and How to Understand Fields Outside of Your Own."  I'm doing this for the COMM dept next week. YIKES. Basically I will be showing persuasion students how to go about learning a subject to create either a convincing argument or propaganda. I am the only student in the class with a working knowledge of another academic area, so I was selected to do this (on music).  I've had alot of random compliments here lately. I'm just tooting my own horn, makes me feel good, and I need it!   Work  is going very well. I processed passports/photos/accommodation files/etc today. I'm getting to do more of the fancy stuff here lately. Its cool.  Jill  and I had a lovely chat today regarding our work-study assigned student. He's not exactly the "best example" of an employee.   TOEFL  is being awesome regarding this credit card fraud. YAY!  I had a lovely time hanging out with  Miranda  this evening. We both fussed about what was getting to us, and I think we felt better afterwards.   Talked to  Gary  tonight. I MISS HIM!!!   The one major thing that went wrong today was poor  Irene  had a student threaten her life. Be Warned Future Teachers!!!!   That's about all. No big quotes tonight.
