Night's movies, I'd say it was his 4th best. I can't say anything about the movie because I will give things away, but I do encourage you to see the movie because it's one of those movies that you have to see just so you know what happens. ..  Last night we played another game of Communist Church. It was great fun. I got thrown against a wall, I ran into a row of chairs, I got 14 ppl out of jail and then ran past 3 communists (all waiting by the 'church') and made it to the 'church' safely (The 'church' is the safezone for the christians). I have a HUGE bruise on shin (from the chairs) and another on my foot (from getting thrown against the wall). Yes...great fun.  One more thing, you have to check out  urlLink this site  and watch the video. It's really pretty funny no matter what party you're associated with.
