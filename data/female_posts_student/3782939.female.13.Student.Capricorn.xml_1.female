Dedicated to the latest Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, there is a new wizarding candy out, one which Harry and his friends enjoy, and is now available to Muggles! :D This candy is...   FIZZING WHIZBEES!!!   Yeah! xD I just tried a handful of them, and I highly reccomend this new treat, for not only does it taste delicious and come in several flavors, it  crackles  in your mouth!!! Keep your mouth closed, hear a muffled crackling. Then, open your mouth, and fill the world with the sound of crackling wizarding candy! It's the tastiest, loudest, coolest treat you'll find! ;)
