BROKEN WORLD                -by ACROSS THE SKY  Promises shattered Answers don't come Friends say goodbye Plans come undone Dreams get crushed Lies get told Words can turn cruel Hearts can grow cold  In a broken world where we cry to feel Some hope that helps these hearts to heal You're my strength, You're my refuge In a broken world, Jesus I'm holding to You  You make sense of the madness And You make darkness flee You bring such a calm To the chaos in me Show me life Tell me truth Day after day I keep running to You
