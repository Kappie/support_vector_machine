After 7 nights of sitting outside with chilled beers listening to the  chirp-chirp-chirp  of the crickets, it now feels as if it's always been this way. Such are the delusions that let us accept winter as something normal, instead of a vast manifestation of existential despair. (And I like winter.)  Back To The Future is on the tube. An all time classic, in my opinion. The entire trilogy, really, is pure fun and enjoyment. I actually remember watching part 2 in the movie theatre with my dad and my brother. Afterwards, my brother (who was only 9 years old at the time) insisted that "hover boards" existed. I don't know how he did it, but he convinced my father to call every store imaginable and ask if they had any for sale. Surprisingly, my father was told that they sold out of the item. Sure. Right. I bet they thought my father was some nut, and they would have said anything to get him off the phone.  "Excuse me, do you guys sell...hover boards?"  " Sure  we do. They're right next to the Moon Walking shoes, and the aluminum body suit."  "Would that be in sporting goods?"   I've actually driven a DeLorean. You know, the car they use in the movie to time travel in. From what I've been told, there are only a few of these cars still around. In fact, all the owners of this car know each other; they are a club. I'm guessing they sit around talking about Back To The Future on the first Thursday of every month. They laugh and share their favorite moments over cold beers and Van Halen music. But, you know, there is always  somebody  who has to ruin the good mood by bring up argumentative points. Last month it was Bob. This month it's Stan. Stan things it's nuts to believe that our lives are based on one simple time line. How can one decision that was made in 1885 (part 3) have any real significance to your life in 1985? "Damn you, IT CAN'T!" Yells Stan. Beers are thrown to ground. Men scramble to their feet. There is yelling and screaming, until finally Stan can take no more and he angrily storms out of the garage. Don't worry. He'll be back next month. He's old now, and this is really the only thing he has to look forward to.  Did you know that you can purchase "flux capacitators?" Well you can. And driving this car. Whoa. The  coolest  thing I have ever driven. When I hit 88 miles per hour, I swear to you, it felt like I could actually time travel. I'm not kidding. It made me feel young. Nostalgic for my youth. But in a good way.     Back To The Future II  But enough of this. I have to go. My grandparents are in town visiting for the next four days, and I can't begin to tell you how thrilled I am. It's been over a year since I've seen them, and I love them dearly. They've been married for nearly 55 years and they are still madly in love. I've never seen anything like it. You can see it in their eyes. When they hold hands. It's adorable. And it's what I want out of life. Coming from a divorced family, I look to my grandparents relationship as the ideal. It makes me think, and it brings up a lot of questions about love and marriage and family. But alas, this is subject for another blog at another time.   Blogging  may  be light for the next few days. But, since I am a computer dork, you can probably count on me saying  something . That is if you care. (eyes pleading.) Which I hope you do.     Before I go, here are some money quotes from the movie.    Marty McFly:  Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?   Dr. Emmett Brown:  The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?  . . .   Dr. Emmett Brown:  If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.  . . .  [Dr. Emmet Brown is doubting Marty McFly's story about that he is from the future]   Dr. Emmett Brown:  Then tell me, "future boy", who is president in the United States in 1985?   Marty McFly:  Ronald Reagan.   Dr. Emmett Brown: Ronald Reagan?  The actor?  [chuckles in disbelief]   Dr. Emmett Brown:  Who's Vice President? Jerry Lewis?   Marty McFly:  What?   Dr. Emmett Brown:  I suppose Jane Wyman is the first lady. And Jack Benny is secretary of the treasury. I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.  . . .  Marty McFly:  Wait a minute, Doc, are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?   Dr. Emmett Brown:  Precisely.   Marty McFly:  Whoa, this is heavy.   Dr. Emmett Brown:  There's that word again; "heavy". Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the earth's gravitational pull?  . . .  Biff Tannen:  I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is LIGHT beer?  . . .
