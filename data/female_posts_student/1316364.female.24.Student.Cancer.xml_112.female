A lot of the time I wish he was home so I finally can have that shoulder I have so desperately needed to cry on.   I look at myself in the mirror and I don’t see what I am sure I should be seeing (a happily married woman) after all how can you be happily married when you aren’t with your spouse. I have talked to Jesse about this. Its not that I am regretting being married, believe me I am not, but I think that being married to someone and not having them there to hold and tell them you love them, every day, its so hard. I go to bed every night and wish so hard that when I wake up this was all a dream and I am back in my old apartment with Jesse sleeping next to me.   I have also taken this time to think a lot about how things are going to be when Jesse comes home for good. How strange it will be to be home and living in a house with your wife, and now her mother and her boyfriends as well. I know that we are not planning on being in my mom’s house for too long after he comes home but at the same time I hope that it isn’t too much for him to have to come back to our life together but having it change so much that he has to make a huge adjustment.   I guess its pointless to be worrying about these things now but after all when you have not much on your mind you tend to think about things that you really shouldn’t be concerning yourself with at this point in you life.
