We didn't even finish the poster until about two periods before it was due. And during the presentation me and kelly were passing out food and maddie and hannah are continuing the posters and maddie points to a picture and says "this is Jordan's current leader, King Hussien" and Ms. Breslin goes "actually he died in January" and we're like "oh my god...." And then after us the PERFECT students go up aka Aimee (the bitch on wheels with a pole up her ass) and Amy and Jess and Alex and theirs is like perfection with sugar on top. And we're all sitting at our desks like "gonna fail, gonna fail, gonna fail"
