He had a bullet wound to the head, and apparently they just gave him mouth-to-mouth. I was merely comforted (aka told to die by Tucker).  Actually, the war is still going on (that's why I'm still at Blood Gulch Outpost Alpha, like I'd spend my free time there), but aside from that... What war? That's a good question. Well, you see, after Master Chief destroyed the entire Covenant Armada on Halo, some sort of war broke out, I don't even know why. The two factions (basically that means sides, for those of you who don't know) were Red and Blue. I guess, for now, it's just called The War of Red vs Blue. I hope that answered your question.
