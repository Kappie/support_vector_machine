I was so awestruck at her performance that I was in tears in the audience. She is a true performer and doesn't belong in St. Louis MO. She belongs in New York on a Broadway stage.  There are truly no words to describe my new respect for her. Never again will I be pissed at her perfectionism, because that's what she puts into her performance. It was perfect, and you could tell her whole heart and soul were in every word, every move, every facial expression.  I am so lucky for her to be a choreographer for Villa and Desmet's shows, because clearly she is the best of the best.  On another note, Ryan came over and we spent the whole day together. First, we did some hot tub over some mini diet cokes. After that, we went to see The Terminal with Tom Hanks. That was truly excellent.   Then, he came back to my house and we ate some good pizza and sat in the hot tub with ice cream sodas.  My mom yelled at us when we were in the deep end of my pool because she couldn't see us and thought we were like having sex or something. Right. You know me, the Villa whore.  Anyway, then we hung out upstairs for a little while.  Now, I am thoroughly tired, and am going to end this blog. Goodnight!
