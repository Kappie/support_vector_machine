How I'm still friends with them and none of the other Henry Adams people, I can't say....we just are. We've had this talk numerous times. It's so weird, especially now, we are all so completely different. Anyone who knows us can tell you that, maybe that's why I've stayed with them for so long. All of my middle school friends and others I was so similar to, and I never hang out with them anymore. Of course our differences can be annoying, yes we fight a lot, and sometimes one of you really freaks me out (and you know who you are) but then we forget about it within a few minutes. That very much reminds me of my sister. We used to do that all the time. We'd tell each other to go to hell, get out of my life, etc...and then forget about it the next day. We two are very different. And I know she reads this now, so I'm not going to say anything mushy, but you know Robin, I like you now. And I didn't really go into this with much thought, and it seems like I should end this with something like "friends are friends but real friends are family" as that would seem to fit, and to an extent I believe that, but lately I've just been thinking a lot about friends, as I know a lot of people have been, and I just don't see too many that I think will last past high school, and that's sad, and I do hope I'm wrong. But I'm convinced you can never replace the whole "can I play with you" scene you went through as a kid, and it's weird to think that all of my really good friendships started like that,  making sand castles on the playground, so simple, I find that kinda cool. I have just now convinced myself that elementary school (not high school) are truly the best years of your life. And again, I don't really have any closure to this, my thoughts often don't, but I've been thinking about that stuff for a while, and I just needed to write (type) it down. I really need to consider a normal journal, these are the kind of things I wanna read 30 yrs. from now. I have a funny feeling this blog will be long gone by then.   Big day tomorrrow, good night.
