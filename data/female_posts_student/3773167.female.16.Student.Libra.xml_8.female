A friend of mine just paid  $150  for the TI-84+SE at OfficeMax, the same price as the TI-89 (actually, the 89s have probably come down some since the new release).  I couldn't believe it.  I mean, don't these people realize that they're paying 50% more for a different color faceplate and some extra RAM they don't need?  The whole situation reeks of ignorance.  The freshman in geometry and algebra II are especially annoying about it... they're just buying their first graphing calculators so most of them have gotten 84s.  They try to act superior because their calculators are "better" than mine and the other oldschool math teamers.  Too bad they don't know how to do anything except add and subtract on them.  Heh.  I don't see the attraction.  They're not even visually appealing... in my opinion, the old look was much more esthetic than the new whored-out version with shiny plastic parts and smooth flowing lines.  Unless you're planning to have sex with your calculator, the changes seem completely unnecessary.
