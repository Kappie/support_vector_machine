So... on thursday (CANADA DAY WAHOO) I did nothing until I like went to a bbq at my dad's friends house.. fun fun and I talked to melissa!! yay... man I miss her... and Chad... im not gonna see him till like monday either *cries*.... theres a whole story about that too.  So you know how I said Dylan saw jess' boob... well he saw mine apparently too... when I was still underwater but w.e. lmao.  Hm.... yesterday I hung out with jess and dylan again... we went to his house and had milkshakes and stuff and, yeah then we went to macs and had slushies or frosters and suckers and stuff and hung out at the park near there for like the entire afternoon. Then it started raining and we were dancing on picnic tables in the rain in barefeet... and then there was this guy that rode by on a bike and we were all looking at him and he wiped out and yeah it was funny. And then my shoes were all wet so I walked most of the way home without shoes on, including walking across the trans canada highway without shoes on... haha... bet you there arnt many people that can say they've done that... hehe. Ummmmm what else.. then we had food for supper and I went to the hospital to visit my mommy with two of her friends. Then then after we went to Starbucks and i had a mocha frappichino and it was sooo good. And then I was like all awake for a long time.  Then I talked to Dylan on the phone from like 10-2 last night and now apparently he doesn't remember anything we talked about after like 11:30 and that was a hell of a lot of stuff.. including him saying hes starting to like jess.  Hm.... Dylan's brother is coming to visit tomorrow till wednesday and apparently I'm going swimming with them on tuesday and on monday we're having a waterfight.... i was like okay.. cept I told chad I was going to do something with him on monday... but with him the chances of that actually happening arnt really all that big because hes a big poo poo head.  So yeah I'll tell my story about chad because I'm bored and its yeah lol. So I havn't seen him for more than a week now and havn't talked to him since tuesday but yeah. Since then I've been thinking about stuff a lot... like he doesn't seem to aknowledge the fact that he has a girlfriend. He just like he'll not be doing anything one day and I mean I'm not gonna call him everyday to see if hes busy but he wont be and he will just sit at home doing nothing and so will I and its stupid and thats like not even yeah I donno. But like I just wanna see him more than once every like week and a half cause thats what its been like so far this summer and thats so not what I want. Just cause I mean he's my boyfriend and I don't wanna never see him cause thats not fun... he just is like always biking and if he cant make time to see me once a week then thats sad. That all im asking too... once a week which is way less than I would really like but at least I'd see him sometimes. I donno I've been thinking about breaking up with him but I like him way too mcuh to just do that without trying to fix what I don't like first. But if he can't make the effort to make some time to get together then thats not what is really fair and I'm gonna break up with him because thats not fair to me to not like ever be able to see my boyfriend.   Then theres him who apparently was telling brennan how far we've gone and stuff and I'm like... I don't want his brother to know that because like his brother is in my classes and if he knows then he'll tell everyone else and then like.. I don't need everyone knowing about what I do with Chad. But I guess I donno I'll ask him about that too. Meh I donno I'm confused.... I'm just used to seeing my b.f more often and kinda getting more attention than Chad has been like willing to give... I mean with Mike and John it was like they'd call and I'd talk to them like every day even when John went away and stuff he'd call... and then theres Chad whos all yeah I can't call from the lake yet brennan calls jess from the lake all the time... I mean how nice is that... I'm really starting to wonder if he cares at all and if maybe he just doesn't know how to break up with me.. maybe he's worried about hurting me or something... either that or it's just his lack of expeirience and he doesn't know whats like normal in a relationship.  Meh well thats kinda a summary of the last few days... a kinda more detailed one lol... I've gotta go get dressed and stuff... I'm meeting Dylan and we're gonna go to macs again and stuff.... possibly go by jess' house and see if she can sneak away from packing for an hour or sumtin to come with us and hang out for a bit before she leaves on monday.. cause tomorrow she's really busy so she really cant get together and she said seh might be able to get away for a bit this afternoon... man I gotta dry my hair and find something that I can wear that isn't really dirty lol... prolly my shorts cause those r the cleanest things I have right now aside from my skirts lol.
