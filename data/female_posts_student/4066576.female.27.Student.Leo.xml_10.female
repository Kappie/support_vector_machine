He will come around 11:00am.  I visited library for returning rent videos in the morning.  However, It was closed.  Maybe, I was too early so, I couldn't return videos. I will visit library again after tutoring.   I earned some money from part time job yesterday. It was so hard anyway, I deposited  $100. ^_________^
