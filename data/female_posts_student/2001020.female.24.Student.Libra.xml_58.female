I WISH: that I would be spending the summer in California. I HATE: the way people have changed in law school. I MISS: the beach and the mountains, and In-n-Out and Jamba Juice! I HEAR: the TV in the living room. I SEARCH: the Internet for something to distract me. I WONDER: if R ever thinks about me like I think about him. I REGRET: letting myself fall into bad relationships that don't satisfy me. I LOVE: R, and M, and being in love. I ACHE: to figure out who I am and what I need for me. I CARE: about everyone and everything and that is way too much! I ALWAYS: feel sleepy and hungry. I AM NOT: easy. I DANCE: when I can! I SING: when I can be alone! I CRY: about the smallest things sometimes, and sometimes I go w/o crying for months. I DO NOT ALWAYS: do what I should be doing. I FIGHT: with myself. I WRITE: very rarely anymore. I WIN: nothing anymore! I LOSE: just about every law school thing I try to do! I CONFUSE: myself and most people I talk to. I LISTEN: with all ears. I CAN USUALLY BE FOUND: at M's. I NEED: to sleep now. I AM HAPPY ABOUT: the fact that summer should be fun! I SHOULD: really take that nap...
