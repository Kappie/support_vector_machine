Though Amanda's tube started going flat so me being the better tuber, I had to switch her tubes. Ruined all my fun. The thing made me fall off it was not my fault! Alex went with a friend (Nick) to drive around in his car. They've been gone for a few hours, nobody knows where they are and Nick isn't answering his cell phone. On a happy note, Amanda is making taco's for dinner! Yumm. Although I do have to go and grate the cheese. Great fun.
