My words can be compressed! I don't really waffle on and on, do I? (Mmm waffles.) Ahh... just thinking about life I guess. It's never easy is it? There is no multiple choice answer... there's always consequences to unseen actions. It's never black and white because black is white, and white is black. (Hah! Got em confused! Now to add a clever 'money saving' offer... muahhaaa) *sigh, just when you thought I had brains* Hehe, I like to keep them hidden though, everyone thinks differently of you if you don't. Ahh! Look Around You is on DVD! Who wants to get it for me first? :P I will... I will... I have to fuel my brain with more randomness! It's kind of nice to think that other people get your humour. And annoying when people don't get when you're not being serious *i'm sure that gets everyone else into trouble as well* Gary Jules - Mad World. It's a good song, sounds like it should be in a movie though...
