Why is the interest rate so low?  in the 80s, the interest rate was around 18%, which means for every 100 hundred dollars that you put in the bank, you have 18 dollars by the end of the year, and the 18 dollars will continue to make money for you the next year.  so for those folks who decided to lock their money away at 18%, by now would have doubled their money 4 times. and for those who decide to take a mortgage at 18% and locked it there, they could have bought 2 more houses by the time they finish paying their mortgage.  the interest rate is created to balance the economy, when the economy is in depression, the interst rate is also low.  when the economy is in depression, people lose their jobs, and therefore stop spending unneccesary money and start saving, this cause other industries to lay off worker, and this eventually lead to few people working.  this is when the government lower the interest rate, so people would save all the money in the bank, spend it instead.  the interest has been the lowest in history for quite a while now, it is consistant at 0.25%, which means for every 100 dollar you have in the bank, you make a quarter by the end of year.  but the interest rate is about to go up, the canadian economy is now looking better.  if the interest rate is going up on savings, it is also going to go up on loans, so mortgage rate is also going to rise, if anyone is looking to get a mortgage, this is the best time to do it.  what are some better ways to save money rather than the bank? stock, they are riskier but have a better interest rate.  also bonds, they are not as riskier and they still have a good rate.  buy a house when you have the money, you can buy a house, and wait for the value of it to go up, normally you can sell it for 10% more than you bought it for.  did you know it is more expensive to live in Beijing than in Toronto?  a one bedroom apartment would cost 1.5 million yuans, even if you converted it, it is still very pricy.  so for those of you whose parents have some savings, i highly suggest that you buy a property in china, for those people who bought a house in year 2000, they can sell it for double the money.  especially with the olympic that's coming up in 2008, the real estate will double if not triple in the next 4 years.
