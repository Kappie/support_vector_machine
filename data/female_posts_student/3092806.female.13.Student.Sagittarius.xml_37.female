The freaking kid doesn't need to tell me that for heaven's sakes. I've known that I was a loser, or a "fag" as he put it, ever since I left my old school, St. Johns.  I just wasn't born to be popular, like him, okay? Nope, I was born to be who I am right now, an anti-social freak that barely has any friends or a life.  I've never wanted to be in with the "in" group. When I was younger, before all that shit happened with my then best friends, I just didn't really care about popularity. I wanted people to like me but I wasn't like obsessed with being the coolest kid in my grade. I was always fine with the number of friends that I had. Popularity was NOT a big issue with me. Well, in the fourth grade, to everyone else but Cole and I it seemed, became overly obsessed with being in with the "in" crowd. My best friends of then, Keri and Bridgid, were especially obsessed with the subject. They always talked about popularity and kept asking why we couldn't be popular. This really annoyed Nicole and I, and I mean it REALLY annoyed the hell out of us. So, we always joked around that we were the misfits of the school and crap like that. Well, Keri and Bridgid couldn't take it anymore and tried to become "popular." They started dressing more "in" and acting more "popular." They ditched us. Keri also made fun of us every chance she got. She, along with Bridgid, completely ruined the life that I had, had at St. Johns. She made our other friends think that we were backstabbing, losers... Oh, it was terrible. I used to cry myself to sleep every night... Eventually Cole and I switched schools. It wasn't only because of Bridgid and Keri though. A little part of it was because of my ex boyfriend named Seth.  In the fifth grade I was totally Anti-Popular. If you were popular, there wasn't anyway that I would be your friend. I made friends with Katelyn and Chloe that year... During the sixth I was almost completely over with my Anti-Popular attitude. I finally began to understand that not all popular people are stuck up bitches, just some. However, I became Anti-Social... Several things just happened all at once which made me distrust people even more... When my mom tried to kill my dad, is just one of them...  So, it sort of annoys the hell out of you when your EBGF is telling you that you're a pathetic loner/outcast that will never have any friends because you're not updated with the current version of "cool." Since when have I ever wanted to be popular? Since when have I cared about having friends? Honestly, I don't need friends. This upcoming school year, all I wanted to do was to actually be myself around people. I don't need friends. They're nice to have and I love the ones that I've got, but I don't need twenty friends and/or admirers to make me feel special or whatever. I don't need popularity in order to live... All I need to know is who I am. Why should I be "cool" if it ruins who I really am?  Gone...
