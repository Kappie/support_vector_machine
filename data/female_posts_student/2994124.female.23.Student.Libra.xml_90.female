Well at least I'm reducing my risk of skin cancer hey.    Now I'm working in the grown-up world there isn't much of interest to blog about. Except Big Brother.  I'm shocked at it.  Do you have it in Canada? Its on its fifth series or something here and they try and spice it up more each time, because apparently unlike other countries, the UK one is dull and no-one does anything bad/naughty.  so they've put one less beds in the house than there are people and all the beds are in one room.  They've also done other stuff to try and mix things up.  I think its TERRIBLE.
