No, not enough time to really get intoo it. But then an Idea comes to mind!! My trains! I hadn't played with them for almost two months! I had lost respect for my beloved trains! So, I sat down, and reconnected with my hobby. I even took my annual train notes  On CPR mainline, A CP Rail freight has just left the Port Coquitlam yards. It's a small mixed freight consisting of 34 cars. It's lead units are CPR SD40-2 5415 and 6027.   On CNR mainline, A small transfer freight has just left the New Westminster Yards heading towards CN's main yard, where hey will transfer the freight to a bigger one, which is heading to Kamloops. This train, also a mixed freigh, consists of 18 cars and the lead units are GP40 9306 and GP39 4103.  Wow, i still got it. Yeah, just like the good old days. Funny how Fred used to do this with me, now he gets payed to do this on the real thing. How amazing how dreams can become reality. My brother is living proof.   Ahhh trains, you gotta love them. Why not? Did they do anything to you? That's right, they didn't, there your friend...  And you gotta love your friends...
