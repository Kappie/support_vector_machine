I showed her respect back.I learned there that it REALLY DOES matter if someone treats you nice.I know it sounds stupid but if you actually in my place, you would know what im talking about.Well, i cant write any more about my days back then because they will just get me angry.Im going to write about tomorrow for which tomorrow my 4 best friends are coming over and having a water fight with me.Ill keep an update and tell you about it.but i plan to have fun the rest of my summer and i hope nothing will stop me.
