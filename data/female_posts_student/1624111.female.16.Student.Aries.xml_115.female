Things ive done and enjoyed so far: -labeling people/things. jejeje. -i drew emily a spiffy picture of eric crarle's "the very hungry caterpillar" eating through my hand. it rocked my socks. even had moving parts! man, if theres a measure of love...it should be in the quality and inginuity of the childish drawings your friends make for you. ha...or not.  yellowfuzz13: little kids draw their parents pictures yellowfuzz13: why do they do that? runismylife24: because they are little  which leads me to another thing...ive realized i act very much like a child sometimes. like with this picture drawing business...and in crayon...why do i insist on crayon? very childish. and the dandelion business last year... and how i sometimes make things to give to people for no reason...and how i bring random "toys" into school to amuse me... and how i tell crazy stories sometimes... and how i want to do small things to make people happy and stuff... i dunno. its kinda like a little kid. especially the drawing though. because...its like... little kids draw their parents (or friends) pictures and give them to them as kind of like an "here, i drew a cool picture i want you to have becauise i love you." ...and...i dunno...its kinda the same idea with me, i guess... im drawing for fun, but i give them to emily cause...not cause i want to get rid of them and cause i dont want them anymore...but...cause...i dunno...its like a friendly loving thing. you know? like..."i feel like giving you something because i like you" and so you give a drawing because its somethign personal you put work into and no one else can draw exactly your picture just like you. i dunno. you know what i mean?  so then i was trying to figure out why im so childish...and my only theory at the moment has to do with unconditional love and the methods most familiar (or those i consider most appropriate) to me of expressing said emotion...but i kind of dont feel like getting into that because...thats a whole...pandora's box...can of worms...kinda thing. what unconditional love is, and how does one love someone unconditionally, and in what kind of relationships is unconditional love possible, and what "unconditional" literally means and what it implies and where friends fit in the spectrum of love and unconditional love and...yeah, i dont want to get into that. too much for me. now and...probatly not for a while if ever i do write about it. mmm, reminds me of olivia and is conversation. but anyway...  what else have i done? still havent stolen the jacket, possibly tomorrow...possibly not... still definitely havent had a sleepover...next weekend though...next weekend i hope.  oooh, watching shakespeare in love on the culver bus this weekend, that im looking forward too as well.  my friends are all failing drivers ed tests! nooo! poor them. i feel bad for them. i know they really want to drive. not just emily...i feel bad for pang too. not for heather though, passing bastard.  and caitlins verdict is still undecided. until friday!  and now for that ensayo...  maladiciones.  hasta luego. -andrea.
