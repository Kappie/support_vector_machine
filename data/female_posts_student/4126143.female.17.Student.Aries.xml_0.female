Forget how close you two once were, Remember, he has chosen her. Forget you memorized his walk, Forget the way he used to talk. Forget the things he used to say, Remember he has gone away. Forget his laugh, Forget his grin, Forget the dimples on his chin. Forget the way he held you tight, Remember he's with her tonight. Forget the times that went so fast, Forget the love that now has passed. Forget he said he'd never leave you, Remember - she will NEVER be you.  *-In every girl's life there's a guy she'll never forget and a summer where it all started-*  Never make someone your priority while allowing yourself to be their option.  "Sometimes I wish I had never met you because then I could go to sleep at night not knowing that there was someone like you out there."-Good Will Hunting  As we grow up, we learn that the one person who isn't supposed to let you down, probably will, and the one person that you never thought would be there for you, is. You're going to have fights with your friends, you're going to lose some of your friends, you may even fall in love with one of your friends. You will eventually lose someone you love - and love someone you never thought you'd find. People are going to hate you, love you, love to hate you, and hate to love you, but the ones you mean the most to will always be there. Life is too short. So have way too much fun - make way too many mistakes - take way too many pictures - have way too many friends and enemies - laugh way too much for way too long - cry over the smallest of things. But most importantly... Love with all you have.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it may be necessary from time to time to give a stupid or misinformed beholder a black eye. *Miss Piggy*  *I'm not an idiot. I know how the world works. I've got ten bucks in my pocket, I have nothing to offer you and I know that. But I'm too involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowing you'll be alright-Titanic
