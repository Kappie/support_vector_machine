I write....chicken out....become too lazy to finish the post or work on it and then I hit the  Save as Draft  button,in order to get back to it later....and then I never do... I just feel so pressured to be witty :)  Actually I just end up having alot of swings..  so here are my posts as is....un edited   Thursday 9:22 AM   9.....10.....Never sleep again   Ever watch those Nightmare on Elm street movies?   You'll be hearing alot from me...... I'm going to be up for hours ignoring all of the rage inside of me right now because I'm afraid of the truths my subconcious will make me face in my nightmares.   so fuck you, you fucking bastard you know who you are.    Wednesday, June 23   Seriously Folks    after reading  urlLink Fish's  blog   Diane: i mean do i LOOK like a girl who would want it up the ass?  Friend: BWAHAHAHA  Friend: I dunno. maybe its a Hatian thing.     Tuesday, June 22   Quizzical Quirks  1. Little John is embarassing and funny at the same time  I think that he's secretly a well spoken sociopath  who's laughing at everyone who laughs at him   2. I listen to William Hung's CD   3. Good News:I'm on a speedrace to hit bottom  Bad News: I'm not going to crack any time soon      **************************** So seriously folks, quit asking me to post more often or your going to get THIS kind of random unadulterated shit :)  From the horses mouth  without a filter in it....
