There's me,  Margaret Bones .  The star of the show.  I'm a full-time student, on the brink of having nothing to do with a lot of her time--I think it's called "graduation".  I've always been a creative, self-reliant kind of person, that's just who Mom and Dad made me.  I've got a healthy ego (who knows  who loves me  the most-- me  or  'the boys' ?  Toss up.)  I try really hard to lay on the angst 'cause it makes the words flow easier, but it's not really me.  My highschool writing was affected by that lilt, but since entering university and pretty much giving up on any writing not 100% academic, my skills have waned and degraded into a cynical sort of musing.  My thick sarcasm acts like a speech impediment, and it mostly makes me really difficult to understand.  I'm the often optimistic, idealistic, romantic and terribly typical bleeding-heart liberal.  I majored in anthro, picked up history and religion minors.  Suffice it to say, I'm going to be terribly unemployable, but I had a blast at school.   B-Dizzy  is my sometimes boyfriend, but forever love.  That will make more sense when the plot contextualizes it, so more on that part later.  I've known B since I was 15, and we were together from the time I was 18, just before we finished highschool.  Best-friends, hands down.  There's nobody that knows me better, even if we're not getting along so well as of late...  Even when we aren't getting along, he knows how to touch me like nobody knows--there's no awkward searching, he knows where and when to touch, and how and when to kiss.  He knows the stories that turn me on, and the cuddling positions that put me to sleep afterward.  We have some very unfortunate fundamental differences, and I can't explain how much of a surprise it came that there were some differences that I just couldn't deal with forever.  Big surprise to us both, I suppose.   Alley , my kid sister,is the light of my world!  She's the biggest bitch I've ever known, yet somehow anytime I'm mad at her, she convinces me with her jokes and her big brown eyes that really I'm the one who should be apologizing.  She is my go-to for late-night chat or sessions.  We missed a lot of good years because we were fighting so much, but we're great friends now, so at least we're on the right track.  She's a smart, witty cookie, and I'm really surprised that she didn't beat me to the blog.  Maybe she'll make a blog for her poetry and I can put a link here?  (Eh, Alley? what do you say???)   Mattee  is my always loyal friend and pothead.  Bunna bunna.  Perfectly platonic and remarkably metrosexual, Matt is by far one of my favorite people in the world.  Somebody (ahem!) pointed out to me recently that we're probably the most perfect match for each other.  And that's pretty true: just the right mix of intro/extrovert, he's artistic and well-spoken, absolutely hilarious, and still completely down to earth.  Hmm, well.  If only he could get the Angel to see that.  She is the 2nd reason why nothing would ever happen between me and Mattee.  The first reason is because then I'd have to see him naked, and I don't know if I wanna see that pasty ass.  (It's probably hairy too--much love Mattee!)   The Angel  is blonde and beautiful and ridiculously aloof.  I feel complete and utter pity for every boy that crosses her path, Mattee especially.  None of them seem to leave with their heart in tact.  I wonder if she ever notices?  Come to think of it, I think I'd feel pity for anyone in her cross-hairs.  She's a sweet one, but vicious!  Yow!  Kyla, also Stin Ky , my best friend, laughs at everything.  In fact, she has a laugh for everything.  She's got this perfect, comical way of parodying everyone--I shudder to think how she 'does' me.  Her wicked sense of humour mixes with her soft  lovely girliness in a way that makes it hard to break eye-contact and even harder to walk away.  Her roommate  Amy  is quickly earning her place as one of the coolest chicks I've ever met.  She's the funkiest, punkiest vegi-vixen I know.   HLFMatt .  That's Hero, Lover, Friend (thanks Ky) Matt.  He's the childhood love that's just never gone away.  He lives around the corner and down the street, yet we've never smoked a freakin' joint together.  That's gotta change, although it's not my fault...  He is perhaps the most creatively romantic guy I know.  Back in the day, he wrote me songs, stories and poems, drew me pictures, played his guitar, and just generally was the most awesome boyfriend.  Too bad he didn't read the part of his Life Manual that said that teenage girls only like boyfriends who are shitheads.  Ah well, he'll find some girl that doesn't want to be mistreated  someday .  There's also British Matt.   The Brit  was a most haughty fling, and perhaps one of the best partners I've ever had.  The sexy thoughts of him just won't fade away.  He's my international man of...something.  He's a terribly arrogant, pig-headed neo-conservatist asshole, but he's also brilliant and a fucking tiger in bed.  Shame that he's on the other side of the world.  The 24th floor is where I find more than just a typical yuppie condo-dweller.   Ani  is the dark chocolate temptation with the hairy chest that I can't resist.  I'm with him and it's all about pleasure.  This man is sumptuous, he touches me and I melt.  It's fabulous.  He makes me feel fabulous, treasured, worshipped, and mostly he makes me forget about everything that's way down below.  Why do I resist so hard?  I don't know.  My parents are a couple of pretty cool folks.  Daddy,  Bubba  when I was but a wee babe, is an awesome role-model, the picture-perfect in-control, take-charge guy.  No sweat for Bubbs.  He keeps trying to prove that he can still go out and party-hearty, as if we might think otherwise.  The first rule of Guitar Club is you don't talk about Guitar Club.  The second rule of Guitar Club, if this is your first night, you have to play!   Mommy  is my best-friend, my worst enemy.  That's the thing with moms, I guess, especially if you're a female too.  Mom's always know what buttons to push, and there's no one that can elicit an emotional response the way a mother can.  Damn her.  But she's the best.  She sent me a length email a couple of weeks ago--I had been having a rough time, and was spending a lot of time away from home.  She emailed me at work one day and said that I didn't have to avoid them if there was just something I wanted to avoid talking about--she and Daddy just want to make sure I'm happy and okay.  Awww.  Mom and I have the regular battle of wills, but mostly we get along in a way that makes a lot of people envious.  Some of these people in my life are from the 'burbs, others are from the Dot.  But they're all my life, and they make it interesting.  Worth writing home about, you might say.  Now I think what we need is a story...
