The idea for it was originally just a short one- or two-pager, but as you can see it evolved into an 18-page monster.  But from what I hear it's very good.  It's about Jake, whose life has basically fallen apart, who is locked in a small glass room with a handgun.  He has a choice to make, and recalls all of the events that have lead up to this point in order to make this decision.   By the prickling of my thumbs Something wicked this way comes. A decision ne'er for a child meant But one he could not circumvent..
