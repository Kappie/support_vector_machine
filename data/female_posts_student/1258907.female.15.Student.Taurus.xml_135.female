Making me reach for you But never quite grasping you Waking up is hard to do And I cant lay back down again I cant shut my eyes I cant breathe, I cant think I love sleeping, but I hate waking up To the harsh reality that smacks me in the face Leaving the images of you To dance around in my head I wont sleep in my bed Where you used to lay, beside me Images fade But memories stay My love for you, wont go away I love you.
