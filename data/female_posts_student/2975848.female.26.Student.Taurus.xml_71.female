My body just freeze Like a rock statue Cold, Hard, Lifeless, My eyes stare wide open at the emptiness. Nothing I see. Nothing I hear. Nothing I say. You know I'm alive, cause I still breath  This can last seconds, or minutes I feel soaked, over limit. I feel everything and nothing All at the same time. As I felt in this state In a flash too I wake up and recover The “normal” me Confused, Lost, Scared. Then I continue my way As if nothing happened. Just go on with my little life.
