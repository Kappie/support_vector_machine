Becca- we could get together and just like ride our bikes to crocket park or whatever.  "There's trees need to be fell".  Oh do I love great quotes.  I'm just rambling.  We should have another water fight too.  That was so much fun!  Oh Becca another awesome thing about next year is we get to help with orientation. Next year will rock my thighs off!  Just going for something different there.  WE WILL HAVE THE BEST TIME EVAAAAAA!  Ok, I'm done.  Well see you guys later.
