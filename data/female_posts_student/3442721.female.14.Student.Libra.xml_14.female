He will be held until he's 20 unless there is a plea bargain and I know this system it won't let him stay with us.  He won't get a plea bargain this time.  I may sound cruel at times but right now you can bet anything that as I'm typing I'm crying my eyes out.  I'm so tired I've been up since 9 am  it is now 4:58 am.  I can't sleep.  The god damn law system is taking away my reasons to live one by one god damn them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  As I slowly watch my self esteem disappear I wonder if it's ever gonna get as bad as it did before.  I walked home ever day from 6th grade with a plan to lose my life. Thank god I never carried them out.  I don't know anymore what to do.  If I lose my Explorer Post now I don't know what I'd do.  They have made me a better person and they helped me crawl out of a freaking deep pit of emotion that was taking over my life.  My post captain. Is always there for me, as are all the others.  I'm happy when I'm with them, they don't judge me. I am one weird person. I'm obsessed with anything paranormal including vamps and lycans, I like clay Aiken *yes I admit even though I love rock, his voice calms me down* I'm into rock. Oh yeah I'm pretty strange. I know my brother. He is bi polar and they can't find the right combo of drugs for him so he snaps sometimes. But he can't control it. I love him so much and I'm sitting here looking at his picture of when I went to Columbus to see him after he had his cancer removed. He had a gauze turban on his head because the cancer was a rare cancer and most people acutely don't get it where he did. Thank god they got it before it reached his brain. I need to leave this house and soon cause I can't eat and I can't sleep. My cats keep on looking at me as though they want to know why I'm not playing with them. And my brothers favorite kitten, fuzzy, was looking for Brett. I know because it is the only kitten that can climb steps so far and he was sniffing at anything of Brett's.  At times like this I wonder if god even is there or if he has his head turned away from us because he doesn't want to watch us suffer as he lets the devil go through with it. I just want some sleep. My mom will be waking me up in 1 hour... Oh and for those of you who read my last post I was falling but I just hit the ground and this time I didn't hesitate to run and jump off the next ledge... I just want to know one thing. When is the next time I'll hit the ground????
