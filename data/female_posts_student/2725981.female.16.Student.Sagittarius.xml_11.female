I'm also getting my licence soon, and I really hope it's before school starts. Technically I can take the test next tuesday, however I still need to take two of my drivers training lessons and my dad has yet to schedual them. But soon...thats what I've got my fingers crossed for.  For the update, my sisters, my mom, and I all went into San Fransisco...complements of her work. We got to hang around Union Square while she was training. It was fun. I love the city...so much to see and do, and just experiance. Every day somethings different...the vendors or the people. I just love it. China Town, Union Square, Uptown, The Embarcadaro and Peir 39 and well as Italian Town...thats my favorite. The little french corner and all that. So much different culture and history all smooshed into one city. I love it.  Becca's being a control bitch. If she can't have it her way, then its no ones way. For heavens sake she threw a fit over who got to watch a movie downstairs. Starts crying, and saying that she hated me just because we wanted to watch two different movies. SHe did the same thing in SF. "I dont want to go in there." "Why can't we go where I want to go?" "I've been there a million times." "Why can't I go off by myself?" "We have different ideas in my abilities." "I dont want you to have something I have, it's not fair. If you get it, I'm going to throw mine away!" She's so selfish. Nothing is a compromise to her, unless she gets 100% waht she wants. I think I'm going to tape the definition of 'compromise' to her forhead one day. The sad thing is, I've conplied with everyhting she wanted. SHe didn't want to hang with us in the city, fine. SHe didn't want me to get the same type of necklace, fine. She wanted to watch the movie, fine. ANd she's never said thank you...never returned the favor...never even acknowlegde that I'm trying to be nice.  I need to get away from her...a vacation on vacation, what a concept. Now I'm getting bitter and cheesy, I'm going to go read a book before polo starts.
