Made the poor boy watch all their scenes over and over again.  Good Christ, who do these damn kid-movie-makers think they are coming up with this shit?  We need them for OUR movies!    So, I'm home now.  In Pocatello.  Decided I didn't need to subject myself to all this stress and trauma any longer.  The basement resort in the mountain fortress looks just fine right about now and I don't regret my decision at all.  It came to me around 342 this morning.  Got off the phone with Levi last night and felt fine about the ways of the world and my place in it.  But soon enough, I realized I was doing the whole "law school" thing for the wrong reasons.  I thought I had to do it for other people.  So I'd have enough recognition, enough worth.  It seemed a challenge befitting someone of my talents and abilities, but I was never really truly convinced.  And for a while, I may have enjoyed myself, been happy even.  But not anymore.  If I have to go through this every 3 to 4 months, I want no part of it.  There's nothing for me here worth all this.  Mom helped tipped the scales.  Called her around 6 to ask her opinion, as all I'd done during the night was pace around the house, sweating and fighting off diarrhea.    "I'm coming home, Mom.  I'm not going to go through with all of this."  "Really?  Had enough?"  "I have.  I can live in Pocatello; it's not that bad.  I could be happy there."  "I know, I think you're right.  I never really understood why you thought you had to go to law school, anyway.  Just to prove to yourself you could?"  "Yea, probably.  But now I realize I don't have to prove anything to anyone.  I can work at the Phone Center again until I find something better.  This just isn't worth all the stress and anxiety.  I never really liked it that much to begin with."  "Sounds good honey, I'll get your room ready."  So yea, here I am and loving it.     (Author's Note: And by all of the writing above, I mean the exam went beautifully and I'm doing fine...FINE!)
