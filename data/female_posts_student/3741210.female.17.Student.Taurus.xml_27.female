Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth end up together as do Jane and Mr. Brigley so it all turns out.  I have book club tonight at Emily's.  I went shopping today for my senior portrate outfit.  I got this really cute knee-length white skirt and a sky blue top an Ann Taylor.  I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure and I also got these cute black sandals that will go with it.  The new premium outlet mall is awesome.  Yall should check it out.  I'm so excited for book club.  Every month we switch off, last month I had it and we read Divine Secrets of Ya-Ya sisterhood.  Tonight we decide who has the next one and what book we should read.  Any ideas?
