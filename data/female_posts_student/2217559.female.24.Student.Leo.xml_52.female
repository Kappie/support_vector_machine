I missed her so much and wanted so badly for her to be by my side at midnight. It was tough breath to take at the end of the countdown. Really tough.   With that being said, I guess I should update you on some things that been going on around the ship....  First, I got my safety card taken away last cruise because one of the bridge cadets questioned me about how many life boats we have. Hell, I didn't know and after taking a short poll around the ship I have since learned that no one knows this information. If you answer the question wrong during boat drill, then the safety officer takes your card. It sucks. I have been so busy that i haven't found time to go get "re-quizzed" in the safety officer's office so i can only imagine what he will ask me when I finally do. It was actually kind fo comical at the time but now I am a little nervous. Greeks are so intimidating sometimes.   Let's see - yesterday, my office was relocated. I am now officially under the entertainment department. Originally I was reporting to the Hotel Manager now I have the coolest boss in the world. He's the cruise director. It's good for me to be in this department because it's gives me the opportunity for advancement. (i.e. assistant cruise director, cruise director, yadda yadi). So now, I am in this office with the assistant cruise director and the cruise directors office is connected off to the side. Let's just say this- my boss rocks. He doesn't care what I do or when I do it. When I try to talk to him about my plans for the day, he says, "I don't care."  He's hilarious. We laugh so much already. His fiance is on board and she's pretty nice as well. And he is NOT greek. Which is good because I am a little over them today.   Last night was really nice. I went to th eopen deck to countdown with all of my friends. I can't wait to have my pictures developed. I have pictures of me and the Captain and all of the bridge officers. Also with Lisa and everyone else. I hope they all turned out well. After the countdown a guest and lisa and I went to the disco to have a few drinks (as if we needed them at this point). We arrived and I saw the Captain. He insisted that we sit with him and so we did. He had a bottle of dom perignon chilling on ice and suddenly when we sat, all of the waiters come over and start pouring our champagne, offering us canapes, etc. It was crazy. We sat there and drank and laughed for at least an hour. I was over it a bit because the Captain drains me sometimes. He's awesome but I have to be so prim and proper when I am in his company and it gets tiring. Especially when you have been in a formal since 4pm and you just want to put on your jeans and flip flops and drink a beer. I am sure all of you can sympathesize. Anyway, we sat there for a bit and then I excused myself and headed to my room to do just that. Change clothes and go to Deck 4 for our private crew party. (The time by now was about 2:30AM). Got to the crew party, hung out with everyone. The floor was very slippery so everyone keep sliding around, busting their ass every 5 minutes. I am proud to say I was one of those people. Hahaha. And then Lisa fell as well. It was hilarious. We would fall, everyone would help each other and then continue dancing. Hahaha. Lisa and I hung out there with all the greeks and everyone else until about 4:00pm. Then about 15 of us went down to the chinese laundry department and had a private party in the ac workshop. We broke plates. Drank vodka. Listen to greek music. The usual. Hahaha. And then Lisa and I left aobut 5:30. A long night for sure. I am tired and hungover like a mad dog today. But at least I survived. I came into the office about 9AM and stayed about an hour then went back to my cabin and slept for 3 hours. Everyone feels like hell today. All of the staff eyes are bloodshot, everyone yawning and just looking like hell. It's pretty funny. My boss came into his office in tennis shoes and shorts.   I think i will go back to my cabin now and take a little rest again. Hahaha. Everyone else is sleeping since we are in port today. (Mazatlan). GOne with the Wind is on TNT today! Yippee!! I started watching it this morning. i am sure it's still on now. Hahaha.   Wishing all of you the best of 2004. I love you all and miss you dearly.  Shelly
