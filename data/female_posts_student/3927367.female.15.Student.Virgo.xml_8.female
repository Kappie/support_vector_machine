For the sole purpose of making us work. My two little sisters, ages 11 and 3, are at swim lessons while my two little brothers, ages 6 and 6, are destroying our downstairs living room. My older brother, age 18, is out mowing lawns for his business. My mother is at the dentist, and my older sister, age 17, is currently 6 hours away at a camp. That leaves me to tend the hooligans that are at the moment "making up stories". One is using Thomas the tank engine, while the other is using barbies. Basically they are talking aloud to themselves right now. They also have Mister Rogers on, and Mister Rogers just got a shot. I hate *twitch*  needles. But you see, if I were in bed right now, I wouldn't have seen that, and I wouldn't have to listen to my little brothers talk to themselves, and I wouldn't have to fold laundry or clean the house either. Oh well, at least now I can practice for our Quad line sectional, which is today.
