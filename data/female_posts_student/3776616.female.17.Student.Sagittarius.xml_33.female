Then I went home for a little while, and Lainie picked me up around 3:30 and we went over to Sari's.  The little Swanson was there, and Marie and Nick.  So we walked to Kwik-Trip to get stuff to eat/drink, then back to Sari's, and decided to go to the carnival.  Lainie and I drove, but everyone else walked... Oh well, I can't help it that I'm lazy...  Then the two of us got sno-cones and sat on the swings having a forced convo w/ some stupid little girl named Rachel...  Argh...  Then we all sat on the playground waiting for Beth, Heathy, and Sam to get there.  Hung out for awhile... I tried to talk to Sam, but I couldn't get anything out... Grrr... Idk know when I'm going to do it...  This is so not fair...  But yeah, then we went over to Beth's for a little bit, then back to the carnival where we met up w/ Robert, Crazy Katie, and AJ.  Robert and Beth went on the Tumbleweed together, and so did Mande and I.  That made me kinda sick...  but yeah, I got a cheeseburger then we all sat on the wet blankets and watched the fireworks.  Then me, Lainie, Beth, Marie, Nick, and Sarah went to Mande's and her mom lit off fireworks.  Then at 11 her mom kicked us out, and everyone except me, Mande, and Beth went home. We went back to Beth's quick to check in w/ her mom and stuff, then we went over to Robert's.  They were just starting to light off fireworks when we got there, then around 11:30 ish Robert had to take Crazy Katie home and left us outside w/ AJ (Robert's sis and friends were inside drinking and cooking bacon...).  Then AJ left, so we sat in the driveway playing w/ fire until Robert got back, and then everyone else left.  Robert shot some potatos out of his potato gun, then tried to play golf w/one, kept missing, so he just started beating it w/ the club, the he got a croquet mallet and started pounding it w/ that...  he's crazy sometimes... But that's ok, b/c he's Robert :)  Then we went inside and pulled out the beers that his sis had left for him, plus the ones that were left from Fri. night and the other stuff that was left from Fri. night.  I hate the taste of beer w/ a fiery passion, and I wasn't going to drink any (I called the only Triple Black that was left, and I was going to just drink the rest ofthe Blue UV).  But then Robert decided to make a beer bong, and he told me you can't really taste it as much that way, so I figured I'd give it a shot (I'd never used a beer bong up until then...)  So he got his old squirt gun tube, a milk jug, and rubber bands/duct tape and put his little thing together.  Beth went first, and her first time she got a few swallows then spit stuff out and didn't plug the hose, so there was a little bit of beer sprayed around the kitchen, but we got it cleaned up.  Anyway, then she went again and got it, so then I went, and then Robert.  It was actually pretty cool, and it does taste A LOT better that way.  Then I drank my Smirnoff and some of the blue UV.  Mande tried a little of both of those too.  Then Beth had another beer, and by then it was almost 1:30, so we needed to leave.  Beth was drunk (3 beers, a drink or two of triple black), Robert (3 beers, drink of two of triple black) and I (2 beers, triple black, few swallows of Blue UV) weren't really even buzzed, although I did just feel nice and relaxed.  Poor/lucky Beth... She's such a lightweight, and at times it's a blessing, but other times it's a curse...  so I walked her to her driveway then Mande dropped me off at my house.  I stayed up until 4 when Ken finally got there, then I fell asleep.  I woke up at 10:45 yesterday when Beth called me.  Did random stuff until Ken finally woke up at 2.  Yesterday was supposed to be a 'Brit  Ken' day, but that didn't really happen.  After he got up we went to Autozone to get stuff for his car (he finally got his Mustang back), then we went to his house to get other stuff for his car, then we stopped at Kwik-Trip so he could show Jason... (guys and their cars...)  Finally we got back to my house and it was 4:30 ish, and I was in semi-sick, semi-depressed, semi-pissed off mood, but I agreed to go out back so we could have a water fight.  Then I came in and changed, sat on the porch w/ him until 5:45 when he left to go work on his car, then went back in my room until Mande picked me up for play practice.  That was fun even though I was in a bad mood, but then I got him and got in a fight w/ my dad about the comp, so I got grounded.  In an attemt to keep myself from totally trashing my room I went running.  Walking most of the time, running/jogging every time I felt emotion.  I just kept running until I thought I'd pass out, and by then my thoughts had cleared again.  That worked pretty well, and I didn't get home until 9:30.  No one even said anything to me...  Anyway, then I ate and Ken came back over and we sat around and now it's today.  So yeah...  Idk if I'm still grounded or to what extent I am, so Idk what I can and can't do...  I REALLY want to have another shindig at Robert's.  That was fun, and it'd be a lot more fun if I didn't have to worry about going home :)
