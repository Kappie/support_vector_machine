Dad actually let me drive Mom and Sarah to the mall-- we had to help Sarah pick out an outfit for her singing "debut" at the Lake Erie Speedway next weekend. She got the cutest little pink outfit, complete with a "pimpin'" hat... she is really going to look hot. Then we came home and BAM!... irritation. I'm sure it has something to do with her hip outfit-- and then me standing there with my nasty hair, nasty body, and a tee-shirt and jeans. Actually, yeah that is it. I love clothes so much, but nothing will fit me, and I don't have any money to buy the ones that do. I guess I'm a cute person on the inside that's screaming to look cute on the outside. But it's kind of impossible-- I've got the most screwed up body proportions and I end up looking stupid more often than not. I hate the way I look so much, and I am afraid that I am going to grow up and become one of those really fat women with a huge gut and a nonexistent sense of fashion.   Graduation was lasnight; I've been dreading it because it has been the primary source of the majority of my angst this past week, and It was just pulling at the corner of my eyes for tears. Heather didn't say a lot to me yesterday, actually she ran off to do something else, and I didn't see her afterwards. That is that. Our friendship is basically through, and it absolutely kills me.   I went through drive-thru lastnight, and Kenny was working. He said that a friend of his had died, and I really want to know what happened.  He didn't say much, and I didn't push it. I guess he'll call when he wants to talk to me. I completely understand not wanting to talk to anyone... actually that is what I am like all of the time.   I think I am supposed to be going to the mall with Morgan tomorrow.. we get paid! I saw some bras on sale at Fashion Bug, and I am going to get them if we go. I need them so bad.
