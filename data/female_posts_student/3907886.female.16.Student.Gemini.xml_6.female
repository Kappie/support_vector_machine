And then, what was even worse: the second I got home, I tried calling 6 people, and none of them were home! I wanted to be all like, "surprise, I'm home! Did ya miss me for that one entire night?!?!?!" But I couldn't even do that.    So than about a half hour later, I go online, and imagine my surprise when 3 of my friends that I had tried to call, sigh on exactly after I did! And then guess who gets a phone call from 2 more papal later?!?!?! You guessed it:I did!    So talking to my friend's made me really happy! It usually always does. But then sad calls started to come in...    First, my friend calls, all in a tither because she doesn't know how far she wants to go with her boyfriend...  Next, someone online tells me their being used by the person that they really liked!  And finally, my other friend got dumped by his boyfriend, and was a wreck.    To tell the truth, all three of my friends were when we talked. And what pissed me off the most is that I couldn't do a damn thing about it! I wanted to just make their problems go away, and their hurting stop with the wave of my magic wand that I bought in Spring Green...    But that's not how problems and heartbreak are fixed. They take time. Damn time. The one thing that should be constant in the universe, but isn't. I know to them, probally just getting through the night is going to be like days. And I don't even know if what I'm saying is right! I just keep thinking, what if I'm giving the wrong advice, or what if what I think is comforting really isn't... Their are so many questions and doubts that I have, but I don't dare go there with these three. They have enough problems, that the last thing that I would want to do is pressure them with something else.    So I lay off of my problems, as well as bad news with them so they don't feel worse. I listen carefully to what they have to say, and tell them kindly what I honestly think and feel. I empathise, but do not feel overly sorry as to prevent throwing them into a puddle of mud and self misery that they would never be able to get out of...    But one more question that I still have is what do I say to them to try and alleviate some of their pain? And do I talk about myself. I don't want to sound self centered, like I'm not focusing on their problem, but I also don't want them to over think it right now. Reflection on one's problem's should come after the coping, healing, and pain have passed. Not during, or it will just make everything much worse.    Oh well, all I can do is try my best, and give it my all. What more should people ask, or expect from me?    For all my struggling friends out their, I hope your problems eventually subside, because life will go on, the pain will cease, and all will be forgiven eventually.    With my deepest love,    ~Ani
