"I love the Japanese language, and I think everyone should give it a try. You should just be ready for a whole lot of pain.TM" Scary huh? Oh well... on with the torture I guess! *It gets kind of boring knowing how to write screeech and thud in kanji... *ahh yes, unflipped manga... *drools** Oooh... just learnt that the little hiragana characters next to the kanji are for kids who don't know their characters so they can pronounce them! Clever huh? Yeah... yeah... I'll run out of battery power soon don't worry. Ooh... go to this website too:  urlLink http://maddog.weblogs.com/  It's also weird but good... gotta go read stuff!
