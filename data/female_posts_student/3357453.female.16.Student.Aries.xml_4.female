"i c u're with liza. at least u can come to me n say hi" like.. its not as if nabil saw her. knowing him.. im sure he will if he had seen her. so.. as  usual, nabil got angry.. n i felt kinda bad.. wat to do.. i left soon after.. telling him dat marz's meeting me.  the truth was, i didnt wan liza to see us again. yep yep yep.  it was still early when we went off.. ard 7.. called yasir  [he's the one who edited my blog for me.. thank you!] he had just finished swimming.. so i waited.. n walked back to marz's house with him. kinda afraid to meet him at first, afraid of disappointing him. who noes? guys.. haha! everything turned out ok though.. he was easy to talk to.. so nice..   SATURDAY went home.. didnt help mum at skool as usual. changed, then went out again.. wit marz n ct.. n nabil!! haha.. dunnoe lah.. just lurrve having him ard. met at city hall. pity nabil at first.. he felt so out of place.. n being the mean me.. i suan him  all i can while i can.. yeah.. had fun..  after eating at LJS, we headed to c sun set at esplanade rooftop.  yeah.. b4 dat.. me n nabil.. we were walking towards esplanade when i saw tis girl.. haha.. dunnoe y.. but i tot she looked familiar.. so i smiled.. n she smiled back.. dat was when i realized shes the girl ive been chatting with online.. haha.. how the hell did i recognise her?? from the pics she sent.. weird how our first meeting had to be that way..  stayed till abt 10.. by then marz's bf, buk, had joined us.. den took bus back to siti's place.. me, nabil, ct n her bf. yep.. he's another heart pain.. here's wat happened.. the bus we took actually passes by siti's place.. but we were kinda late.. so we stopped at kovan n took the train to sengkang.. tis guy.. hereby referring to ct's bf.. he was shagged out i tink.. his eyes were red.. n yeah.. from the station to the bus-stop closest to ct's block, he hardly spoke.. at the stop, we flagged a taxi for tis guy while he just sat staring into empty space. ct didnt want him to take the bus.. coz it was real late oreidy.. i mean.. she was only doing the right thing. when we finally stopped a cab, tis guy looked up n said, "who says im taking the cab home?"   i was so pissed lorh.. its like.. he knew we were flagging a cab for him.. n all this while he just sat there.. n he didnt even tell us he was ok with taking the bus or anything. like wat the hell?? sometimes it really doesnt pay to tink for some ppl.  SUNDAY left ct's house early n headed to tamp.. met yasir.. hang ard for a while.. den decided to go cycling.. yep.. i troubled him a lot dat day.. he had to go to his frens place to borrow a bike.. den to the petrol station to pump air into the wheels.. den back home n took the other bike.. sigh.. come to think abt it.. i du feel bad.. for everything that day. like.. he could have spent the day watching cartoons yet i dragged him out of the house.. hmmmmm... bad bad me.  had lotsa fun though im sure he didnt. haha.. cycled to east coast den back to tamp.. like.. surprised at myself.. didnt tink i'd even b doing tis kinda tings.. oh well.. all thanks to yasir.. humph!
