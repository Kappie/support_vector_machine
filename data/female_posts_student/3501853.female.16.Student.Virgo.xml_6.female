I worked out for a bit at RecPlexx then I picked Arthur up. We went cigarette shopping for him, ate at Panda Express for me, then went to Lake Opeka. After I dropped him off, 99.5 played Lonestar and going home wasn't a good ride for me. Came home, talked to jon and kev. I love kev lol I really do I'm glad I'm showing it now, I hope he's noticed cuz I don't want to lose him too. Anyways, I know what to get him now for his birfday yay. K, I still don't feel good so I'm going to get sleep. *i miss you more than life itself and even if it looks like i'm not thinking of you, you're all i think about. *life will give you a 1000 chances to reconcile and 10000 chances to make mistakes but it only takes 1 drastic mistake that leads up to a 0 chance of reconciling that can makes a person realize all of other's life chances were small change to this.
