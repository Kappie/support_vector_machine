	 
      I am you, and you are me We fly and sing and cry together. Your eyes, your lips, your nose all me, all mine I breathe and you inhale- you pain and I cry You will die, and my heart will break But my soul will rise and we shall fly and sing and cry together For I am you, and you are me Together- we are one.
