But now I can't even tell if I recognize you're shadow, It was you're choice and now you also belong to the past, to that past I want to let go.  The days past by, and the old me just disappeared...I've become someone's reflection. You are the one that can save me but I guess you're to busy with yourself, I can't blame you, I knew it was going to be like this. Every day I wonder if you're ok, every day I live on knowing that you don't need me, not at all. I guess I'm just like a whisper that passes but you don't really feel it; I can't live like this, caring about you're life but not been a part of it, The last tear I already let go, and the last prayer I already said.   I never thought I would care about someone like this...You two gave me wings and ripped them away. Now you're gone, and left me in the shadows where no light can reach me, I guess it's better this away, you can go on..Living your life without another problem...Me.  I will return to the place I belong, back to the waters of my origin...I wont sleep for I will be the thousand winds that blow, the diamonds giant on snow, the sunlight on ripened grain, the gentle autumn's rain...Back to the beginning.  No one will be forgotten even though I have left all your heart's, I will forever have the memories that will never keep us apart.   Lost in my mind, surrounded, Looking for an arrow to follow, Left with nowhere to go, to fall. The game is over, I have lost I drop and cry out in defeat. The loneliness has destroyed my life, Id change it all in a heartbeat. Kick me down more so than I am, It's not like I know the difference, Im just waiting for my life to end And my funeral to commence. I havent got anything to prove So it might as well end now fast, End it so I have no future So Im just a memory of the past.  Please don't do this, You are all I have left. No matter how much I beg you my heart is broken ,I am alone, I am ruined; Alone I pray for something better than this  I beg you god if you exist, I fear for my life, No more pain my soul is a mass of scars now, I am a thin surface being ripped open, I can't contain it like I used to  I have nothing left.
