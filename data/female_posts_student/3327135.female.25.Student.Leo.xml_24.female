I know that not everyone can tolerate Jackie Chan's movie, but it is still a good one (IMHO). :) I don't want to mention here what is funny in the movie as it would spoil all your fun watching it later. ;)  Currently, I have to prepare for GRE. I had been planning to start reading those books since last week, but I had not managed to do that because of a very obvious distraction. Hahahaa.. It is difficult to update my blog without mentioning Flora's name! :P   Without doubt, I am sure all of you guessed it correctly what the distraction is! Hehehe...
