This morning he asked if I would mind reading a letter he had written in English, since English is his third language and he is not very comfortable writing it.  As I read the letter, he explained that it was to an anthropologist in Germany that is doing a study on German culture before and after the Second World War.  She was collecting pictures of school children with their zuckertute, which are these bags of goodies that kids get on their first day of school.  He had one of these pictures of his sister, and he was mailing it to the woman with the letter.  He closed the letter by stating that both his parents and his 3 sisters (all pictured) were killed in the Holocaust not long after the picture was taken.  That is incredibly sad and depressing.  Why were the Nazis such terrible people?  I mean, sure, I can understand the existence of one crazy evil man like Hitler, but why did so many people so willingly (granted, they weren't all willing) go along with the madness?  Sometimes I just don't understand the world, and I hate the way people can be so destructive.   And then I think, a lot of people in Israel no doubt have similar stories.  And of course it wasn't just the Holocaust, the Jews have been persecuted time and time again throughout history.  And that must do something to the collective psyche.  No wonder some of them are so crazy about Israeli nationalism- they built this country, and it's the only place a lot of them can call home.   Sigh.  It's such a big, confusing, complicated mess.
