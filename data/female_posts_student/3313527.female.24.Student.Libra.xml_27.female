I will have to either 1.work full time and go to school full time or 2.get a high interest personal loan and go to school full time. I can't find the right remedy for this dilemna. Last night as I was heading towards sleep I asked myself for a dream which would help me find an answer to this mild financial crisis. This is what I got.   I am pushed off the shore of England in a small round blow-up raft (that looks more like a kiddie pool) and I'm spinning and spinning in it, it's the centrifugal force that's keeping me afloat and heading towards my destination, so I keep paddling and sending my body weight around (like making a whirlpool when swimming) to keep it going in the right direction and to keep me from sinking. As I'm spinning I lean back and put an arm up and say "This is my Emancipation Proclamation!". I spin into 'port', which is this kind of cartoony looking Massachusetts coast town. I meet some sketchy people there, it's all this kind of shady dark cartoonish thing and I don't remember a lot except that I meet a man who is supposed to be my 'real' father- there's this whole vibe going on that I'm without family, that I'm an orphan, and there's this sort of Charles-Dickens-meets-Colonial-American-History thing. The whole thing had an undertone of family disturbance, all the people I meet are short and squat and I think there's some small children somewhere who are dying. The 'father' has an evil laugh and is overweight and short and sweaty with short curly hair. The dream ends with him going out to sea in his own boat and leaning back and laughing.  ***  Not a whole lot to go on here... anyone want to take a stab at it? I was more hoping that I'd get a dream telling me to go dig somewhere for hidden treasure, or telling me exactly what kind of job to get to maximize the hours I spend working. Guess I shouldn't expect something quite so straightforward from my dreams. In some shamanic dream work I did a few years ago we talked about dreams as having moments where they are the most energized, where there is the most power and wisdom to be gained from them. In this dream it's where I'm spinning in the boat and make the Emancipation Proclamation comment. That's like the 'climax' of the dream and the rest is the resolution. So maybe if I look into that aspect, do some free-associating on that, I'll find some wisdom there.  *** "That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord 1863, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States,   shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free ; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom...  ...And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages..."  -A. Lincoln from Emancipation Proclamation
