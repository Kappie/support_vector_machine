And the more i think about it, the more i reluctantly realise that Katy isn't that different than lafayette. Its only the ppl that i miss. The ppl make it home for me. I stayed at lys's for a week. and it felt so incredibly natural. Like i had always been there, and always would. I never once thought in my head while i was there, i'll be leaving.... It was amazing. For a week it was just lys jackie brandon and me. We didn't do much; hanging around the house or brandon's. we all baked a cheese cake that turned out to be the ugliest thing any of us had ever seen and a Rum sauce that could knock you down after one serving.   Youknow how there is that handful of ppl who know you?Let you feel like yourself. and you can let loose and not have to feel you're playing your part, or constantlytrying to exceed ppls predisposed opinions of you. You dont have to be under the ball every second to prove yourself.  That was what it was like there. i could say anything and not worry about what they thought of it. We were constantly just joking around, making each other laugh, goofing off, doing what we felt like doing at the second. The weirdest things come out whenppl like that are around you. but its an amazing feeling after being stuffed into a form fitting box for the past three years. I haven't felt myself in the longest time. I haven'tfelt like i was free to be myself.Since i walked  into that classroom in8th grade. I've been trying to be who they want me to be. and i've suddenly realised i was doing it without noticing, and i'm over my head now. i dont know how to dig myself out of this one.   I am at a loss about what to do with my life. I hate the way we are forced to live. Its so impersonal and disconnected!its a mystery to mehow ppl go about their lives.Its not like anythingi've had can  be called arelationship. So i am really at a loss as to what to do. I know that i want this. But i feel like everything is against me. time, location. the last thing i want it to be is a hassle. but with me being a dumbass and not getting my license, Zoning ppl out of their minds so that he goes to a diff. school,Band taking up so much of my time,  and all i have is four days.  i want to see my friends. want to actually spend time with gordon. i've got music to memorize. Books i reallywant to read. Hello,backto reality.  Whatev.  im going to go take a shower. Fix up my room to live in it again. unpack. make plans
