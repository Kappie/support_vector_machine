    
       So I'm finally doing it. I am going back to tech to visit. So far my (tenative) itinerary is that I will arrive sometime on the 13th of May, go to Julie's graduation on the 14th, Michelle's wine and cheese party on the 15th and leave sometime on the 16th. If you would like to be scheduled in let me know. I will be staying with Tiff if that's still alright with her. I would love to see all of you hokies while I'm there so let me know what's going on. You can email me at my new spiffy Purdue email at jwelsh@purdue.edu. Can't wait to see you all but I really should be study macroeconomics for my final tomorrow rather than writing this.
