I told the guy my kids were at their dad's.....my cell was dead...and at that time had been locked in my car all night!  And to be quite honest, that I was still asleep myself.  So for some reason they have my cell # as having called all those times.  The funny part is there were recordings that I listened to and I told the guy...well you definately have the wrong place because one call sounded like it was from a kid who was black and the other was from a little girl about 3 or so.  So now I am bugged b/c for some reason whoever called was logged as comming from my cell phone.  At the 8am-930am window when those calls were made my cell was dead beyond dead and locked in my car.  Like, dead to the point you couldn't even get it to power up.  So I called AT and talked to them about it.  However, I am no further in the understanding of what happened except for the fact that it was not a mix up through them.  So now I don't know what the hell happened.  They can't press any charges though and they even admitted that when they called back to make sure everything was ok, which was when the message got left, it went rigth to my voicemail.  Dugh morons!  Obviously that means the phone is powered off!!  So that was my exciting day.  Well, that and going grocery shopping with all three kids.  Geez was that fun, let me tell you!?!  So anyway gonna go for now!  TTFN B
