It was weird..I was interested in what was happening..and I was asking my dad questions...and he knew the answers...it was quite an interesting "fling" I had this morning.  Speaking of fling...what is the term you use for when you lose calories?? I believe, and Gina believe, that term is fling, but I've been told otherwise. Me and Gina started talking about this and this is what we came up with..To "fling" calories a person can: 1) Laugh 2) Exercise 3) Do the hokey pokey We believe that calories cling to your fat..and build up over time..to make a person definatley obese. So in order to "fling" them you must be working hard or shaking uncontrollably. Try it, it works I swear!  So...this is kinda awkward, nothing to say, at all.  I'm listening to David Wilcox right now..I love listening to his music...it's so relaxing...and it reminds me of my late uncle so much. Nothing could ruin my mood right now..its so relaxed and carefree....  Sometimes I wish I could fly..I would fly so high...so high into the sky, above the tallest buildings, above all the birds, I would fly up by the highest clouds and look down on all of God's creation. And then just for kicks I would spit, and then go back down on the ground and look for it..unless it would dissolve on the way down...THAT would be FUN!
