I think I've cross over the line and yes, I've screw up big time... He thinks that I've make him to feel small, to feel worthless.. yah while he was saying all this, my head was juz playing "I didn't mean to come across as such, I don't want you to totally eradicate whatever you are doing or even to control your life... I juz want you to do less of it... I care abt your health cos I don't want you to leave me so soon"...   Recently, the thought of death has entered my head with the results of my medical checkup... Ok this sound kinda ominous but yah I always have this feeling that one day, I'll contract a terminal disease.. funny yah.. but yes, I've gotta go for one more checkup for a second opinion on my condition... I'm juz afraid that I'll end my life so shortly especially when I've found someone that I can spend the rest of my life with...   Coming back to the problem... I think I'm not in a position to judge cos I'm no better than him.. if he thinks he's worthless, maybe I'm equally as worthless or even moreso... William is rite when he said that sometimes guys want to have submissive gfs who allow their man to do whatever he wants... I ask William: even to the extent of seeing destructions falling upon their man... Yes..was his reply... I don't think I can be such a gf and maybe I hav to learn to be so... it's juz sad... yah guess William is rite afterall...   I'm kinda tired..dunno if it's emotionally or juz physically tired my whole body is aching especially my lower back... dunno if it's related... Lord, renew me each day.. thank you for every moment that I'm alife.. thank you for every breathe I take..
