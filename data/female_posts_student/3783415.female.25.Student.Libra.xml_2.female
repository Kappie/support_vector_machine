As a counterexample to what I am saying in the discussion one might bring into the argument some of what Moore has been claiming about ethics in our text. So without further ado:   Mike -   H.L. Mencken (1880-1956), a literary critic and newspaper writer in America, once said, "Philosophy consists very largely of one philosopher arguing that all other philosophers are jackasses. He usually proves it, and I should add that he also usually proves that he is one himself." I can't help but think of this everytime I wonder what I'm doing when I'm reading what Chuck likes to call, "A bunch of dead white guys." Does anything I'm reading serve a purpose? Oh, but it must. If history is determined by ideas then it is worth my time.   I usually like to balance this quote out with a good one by Stanley Cavell, "I understand it [Philosophy] as a willingness to think not about something other than what ordinary human beings think about, but rather to learn to think undistractedly about things that ordinary human beings cannot help thinking about, or anyway cannot help having occur to them, sometimes in fantasy, sometimes as a flash across a landscape; such things, for example, as whether we can know the world as it is in itself, or whether others really know the nature of one's own experiences, or whether good and bad are relative, or whether we might not now be dreaming that we are awake, or whether modern tyrannies and weapons and spaces and speeds and art are continuous with the past of the human race is not irrelevant to the problems it has brought before itself. Such thoughts are instances of that characteristic human willingness to allow questions for itself which it cannot answer with satisfaction. Cynics about philosophy, and perhaps about humanity, will find questions without answers are empty; dogmatists will claim to have arrived at answers; philosophers after my heart will rather wish to convey the thought that while there may be no satifsying answers to such questions in certain forms, there are, so to speak, directions to answers, ways to think, that are worth the time of your life to discover. (It is a further question for me whether directions of this kind are teachable, in ways suited to what we think of as schools.) [Themes out of school: Effects and causes, Stanley Cavell, University of Chicago Press, 1988. P.9)   Fyfe -    'Isn't Philosophy Great!' or 'The Purpose and Goal of Philosophy'   I am not a cynic about philosophy. Nor do *I think* am I a dogmatist.  I do believe "questions without answers are empty", and that in philosophy you are likely being dogmatic if you "claim to have arrived at answers". But that leaves the possibility that philosophic questions do have answers, just ones not yet obtained. I have always believed "while there may be no satisfying answers to such questions in certain forms, there are, so to speak, directions to answers, ways to think, that are worth the time of your life to discover."   I reject all conclusions, and judge philosophy's progress entirely in the directions to answers it finds and the dogmas of the past it escapes. I dedicate my life to helping philosophy along in this way, fully believing there are answers for a much much later generation of philosophers to strike upon.   This is why I cannot accept ethical nihilism. Because we are too early in philosophy's history to make such a conclusion. Especially when in ethics there are SO MANY unexplored "directions to answers" still left open. When a child realizes the justifications their parents gave to them for ethical rules like "don't lie" are full of holes, they don't immediately turn to an ethical nihilism (or at least that is not the rational move). They begin to think about ethics. (Full stop) Of those kids, the more adventurous ones explore the different theories of ethics available to them in books (sadly, normally in religious books).  In the same way and for the same reason, the state of the child is also the phase all humanity is in. Our generation has rejected the B.S. they have been hand by earlier generations, but it is entirely too soon to conclude ethical nihilism. We, and for many generations after us, must study philosophy and ethics without the expectation of conclusion.   We know how to check, agree upon, prove statements like "Billy is in the chair" but "Billy should be executed" is a queer statement we are only beginning to seriously look for some sort of understanding of.   As far as "living without ethical conclusions", this is quite the problem. However, that is the one I just solved for you. To pursue ethical knowledge is THE ethical thing to do in this situation. A consequentialist ethic with "do the action that contributes the most to the market-place-of-ideas in its pursuit of ethical truth" at the top. You shouldn't steal because you harm the society that must exist to sustain an active market-place-of-ideas. Free speech is societal necessity because the pursuit of any form of knowledge is hindered by limits put on speech--ethical knowledge is no exception. NASA should be given funding because knowledge of the universe, our place in it, etc. seems relevant to our pursuit. So donÂ’t complain that you must act today and that this ethics only offers you promissory-notes for ethical guidance, because it absolutely does tell you how to act today. It says, "get a job and contribute to society!" Perhaps not a job on the front lines like in science or philosophy, but one in the support chain like food service or computer science or...    Finally: I agree with Cavell (I think this is his) that questions of philosophy are not questions, they are riddles. The difference is that a riddle is not properly understood until the answer has been given. For example, a King once told a citizen to arrive at his dinner party not dressed but also not naked. When making this command the King did not have in mind any answer to his command, but when the citizen arrived wearing nothing but a fisherman's net, he approved. What the King was really saying (analysis in Ayer's sense of the word) was "Arrive at the party in a way that I will accept as not being dressed but also as not being naked" without himself knowing what he would accept. In the same way "What is it ethical to do?" will, and has, gone through many changes before it will be answered. When I ask that question I don't ask it directly, but as something whose answer will change the sense of the question but I will still accept as an answer. Ethical Nihilism approaches "What is it ethical to do?" head on like a question, but philosophy is a riddle.     Margaret Thomas - Now I know where your faith lies, Fyfe!    Fyfe -   Ethics is the field that tells you what you should do. Since I haven't found any cogent demand from ethics about what I should do, that is what I am studying. One day in my youth I asked "what should I do?" I am still studying philosophy because I never got past that question.   How can you choose be a lawyer or a biologist?!? "Because it interests me." Why does that matter? "Because there is money in it." Why does that matter? I study philosophy because it is the default. Philosophy IS the act of asking "What should I do?" and since I don't think we have an answer to that question, I don't understand how anyone can choose to do anything but philosophy.   I do NOT have faith that there is an answer to the question "what should I do?" I do not have faith that there is an ethics. But it would equally be an act of faith to say there is not an ethics. It is an open question. One that I study because it is rationally the default question. The study of ethics is the rational thing to do when no rational reason can be provided to do anything else, because ethics is the search for a rational reason to do something else.   That is my ethic. With the study of ethics being the highest good. An ethics based on an ignorance of ethics and what I see as the ethics that results from that ignorance.   I don't see faith anywhere in that. Otherwise it wouldn't be my ethic    Margaret Thomas -   Perhaps your faith, Fyfe, lies in the assumption that you should DO ANY THING at all?    Fyfe! -   Ummm... how do I not do anything? I don't see "doing things" as escapable.   Now you could reword your objection by stressing a different word, "Perhaps your faith, Fyfe, lies in the assumption that you SHOULD do anything at all?"   But I am not assuming that I should do anything, that is precisely what I am out to find out.
