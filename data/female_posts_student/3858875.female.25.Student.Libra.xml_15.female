Nina and Gurmant Grewal are married Conservative MPs from Surrey BC, one of the 'angry taxpayer' capitals of Canada. MPs get $20K a year for their living expenses in Ottawa, and Nina wants to cash in on both of their allowances, for $40K per year.   Cos they're independent MPs and independent thinkers!   Gurmant, however, disagrees with the plan. Not surprisingly, because he campaigned on fiscal conservatism.   Don't get me wrong - I'm not an outraged 'taxpayer.'I'm pretty proud that I've managed to bend, twist, and pokes in a lot of rules here at UBC - and hate to see someone manipulate the 'system' in such obvious ways. I am also disgusted because I'm certain that at least some of the Grewal's constituants (in working-to-middle class Surrey) have beenadversely affected by cuts to social housing and services.   Pity the liberals split the left wing vote in BC!
