To everyone who came: Thanks so much for coming, and I'm glad you had such a great time!  To everyone who missed it: HAHA SUCKA!!!!  It was so great. Ten million times better than homecoming. I had so much fun. Moshing to Rob's band, and sneaking away when we saw Mr. Dever coming our way.  Rob (into the mic): Ask me if I want some waffles Alex (into the mic): Do you want some waffles? Rob: (still into the mic): If by waffles you mean an all night orgy, I'm up for waffles all night long! Mark's absolutly insane cat costume, and Amber as Evil Cher. And dancing with alex. (it's funny how the dj's son can play as many slow songs as he wants to) And then (heeheehee) going to waffle house and squeezing six people into one booth and five other people pulling up chairs, and me drowning in three cups of quickly emptied coffee, with a very warm arm over my shoulder. Yes, when is the next drama dance? We could all go for a little more waffles. :-D
