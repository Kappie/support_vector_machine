Finally after many years of this life I'm ready to come out and let people see the real acacia, for once my mom and dad will see I have a voice and that I like to speak it when everyone else isn't around. Now for simple background information. I was born into a family of 6 counting myself, during this past year a lot of things have happened my family no longer accepts who I am or that my dad is always spending time with me. I've sat there time after time being ridiculed by my eldest sister tally and my other sister kira. They just never leave me alone and then kee is brought in by the fact that he is abusive and since I'm the smallest, weakest, and wont tell he has to beat up on me. My mom resents me saying I was an accident and if she hadn't been stubborn I wouldn't be around she thinks that I'm am the root of our family's problems! And yet she is a hypocondriac. Well this is me get used to it  acacia
