It is solidly acted, Wolfgang Peterson guides his film with a steady hand (unlike Stephen Sommers) and the effects are seamlessly woven across the screen.  On the other hand the film is way too long and lacks a pizzazz or sparkle that demands a second viewing.  I couldn’t help thinking afterward if a centuries old poem is the best source for a summer movie?  The film touches on some of Homer’s themes-loyalty, war, fame- but then tweaks the plot to make it more cinematic.  The result is less than satisfactory.  Peterson made a safe movie, smarter than its competition but not too smart to alienate the summer audience.  I would have liked it if he’d conjured up a little of that Tarantino fearlessness, not giving a damn what the audience wants or expects and made a smarter, more political film.  I don’t wish to sound dismissive of  Troy .  It is a solid picture.  Brad Pitt brings an animal masculinity to the role that is appropriate and the older actors (Gleeson, Cox and in particular O’Toole) apply their greatness into underwritten roles.  Orlando Bloom, like in  Pirates of the Caribbean , has the lame duck role that would have been overshadowed in a one-man play, but luckily for most of the film he’s playing off an averagely pretty German model whose bland stare wouldn’t launch a dingy, let alone 10,000 ships.  For $200 million they couldn’t budget in Angelina Jolie?  The real find of  Troy  is Bana, who infuses Hector with an empathetic stoicism.  The film is at it’s most focused when it concentrates on the hesitant obedience of the kingdoms two greatest warriors.  The final showdown between the two is as beautifully choreographed as it was performed.  Because the heart of the movie is the comparison and contrast between Achilles and Hector, the film, with the exception of O’Toole’s lovely speech, putters out after Hectors exit.   Troy  hits all the notes it aimed for, and was exquisitely shot, but never quite excels.  Yes it’s the best in it’s class, but being valedictorian in school of idiots isn’t much of a compliment.
