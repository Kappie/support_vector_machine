Today we went to Union Station and I saw an AMISH MIDGET!! I kid you not. I've been singing the "Touch my dave" song for the past two days, but I can't sing it out loud because people will just be like, "WHAT THE HELL?" My roommates are pretty cool. We're all pretty cynical and sarcastic, so it works out well. The food here is slightly shitty, but we get to have lunch at actual restaurants almost every day, which is a big plus. Actually, right now I'm hella bored. I haven't really made any friends here. They try to get us to know people by getting us to mingle, but I'm not a big mingler and half the people get on my nerves anyway, but that's just the way I am I suppose. I miss you all greatly. I hope you had a most excellent time at the beach. Tonight we're going to the FDR and Jefferson Memorials so that should be relatively interesting. I know Mandy has fond memories of the FDR memorial. It's weird because we keep going to all of these places and I have these flashbacks to 8th grade, which is slightly scary and funny at the same time. Well, I think I'm going to go to my room now or something. There really isn't much to do around here when you have free time, which is pretty sucky. I want to hear what exciting an intersting things you guys have been doing in my absence. I'll post again soon hopefully (it's a bitch to get a free computer). Peace out my homedogs.
