This is a list of doubles, that Mel and I devised while in a boring Art History lesson! We racked our brains and this is all the ones we found, and it is seriously a lot! But if u go to St.Steves and are a double that we have not got on our list - the comment here and we'll add u!   Church Doubles  --> Pip x3 --> Gemma x2 --> Tim x2 --> Pete x2 --> Ashleigh x2 --> Rach x2 --> Steph x2 --> Jamie x2 --> Andrew x2 --> Dave x2 --> Bec x2 --> Steve x2  see, how many is that?
