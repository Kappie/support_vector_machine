I'll never be trusted, never be considered good for anything  The memories of you, I am throwing away for when I replay them, all I shed are tears There is no love inside of you left for me No space in your heart, now I give up too and sit in remorse    and discontent thinking of what to do The memories of you fade as I lose my heart and no...   there is nothing I can do.  Back from the SAT, it is 5:13 pm.  Cried all of yesterday, all of today, cant stop. dont know when it will.  I cant pick up the phone and call anyone or else a beating occurs.  I dont know what else to do with myself.  suicide is the cowardly escape.   Day 2 of wishing I was dead.  out.
