OK, so I have no idea  who  exactly you are; that's the beaut of the 'net, though, we'll just get to know you through here and you could lie and give us the impression that your a charitable, wonderful star of a person when in fact thou art a blackhearted scoundrel. Heh, well I'd have to say you're a good guy, if Lindsey likes you, you must be pretty darned worthy, and Lindsey has finely-honed tastes in the selection of acceptable facets of humanity.  Don't worry about Mitch, he's just a name.  As for me, I'm the stupid one that everyone thinks they like because he's funny, even witty, I dare say, but in fact, are just laughing at him because he is stupid. And I would encourage you to do the same, if you feel so obliged, because it  fuels  me, hahaha. I would also like to add that I am the starkly emotional one, apt to whine about girls and how life is screwing me over, and just fresh off breaking up with a long-time obsession that isn't quite gone yet, mostly dealing with dreamsI've been having right now. Don't worry, you'll be as sick of the whining as everyone else is in about three hours, less depending on your "lil' whiny bitch tolerance level".   That's me, have fun BLogging.
