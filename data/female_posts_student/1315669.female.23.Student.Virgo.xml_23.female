Today is my baby's Birthday..*gurps* I hope he likes what I planned for him later... Ain't that cheap at all man.. Sigh  Mummy had a bad relapse just on New Year's Eve. Somehow, I wasn't surprise. Having providing her own daughter with a medical education, yet she just refuses to heed my advice on proper therapeutic dosing is such a contradictory. So what is the purpose of me having to study this when my own parents are practising their own kinda of medic knowledge??? Geez, Pissed to the core was an understatement.   One lucky thing was..My dear bought me a looped ear bunny. It's only 6 weeks old now! It's so adorable gosh..I wish I cld cuddle it to bed everynight! Even my mum who dislikes small pets says Frizzy ( the bunny's name) has a really cute butt..like that of a bear! HEhe.. love it to bits. I took out to play every so often a day and let it run ard the house and my room. It has grown bolder and is scurrying all the time playing pseudo- hide-and-seek game with me. Heheh. So sweet.   Sadly, I'm still a victim to bouts of mood swings. Period just came not long ago and seriously..I hate being a woman. BElieve it or not.. My Fucked up pms symptoms start to manifest as early as 2 weeks before the REAL thing. GEez..I'm only like normal almost half the time..other than that I'm in the realm of spiritual and hormonal torment that wun let me off till it's over.  ~@!#@%$%^#%^$#  I'm drinking again..can't get to slp. Drinking makes me drowsy...nah..more like.. it makes me numb to the incessant thoughts that aint healthy running through my puny brain. Just read Cheery's blog. Hey ger, just wanna tell u that u are hell of an attractive ger and U dun haf to constantly seek for love this way. There are lots of things out there for u to pursue and seriously, men not involved with u in a serious r/s are JERKS and they have no qualms of ditching and being bastards if they have to..ok? I learbt it so many times the haRd way *splats* Hate men who think that women are just used for their vaginas. Damn it. I'm off to dreamland soon. Catcha all laterz
