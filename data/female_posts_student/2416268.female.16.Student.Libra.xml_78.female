What is it about Steph that attracts such hatred? What has she done to deserve it? Why does it happen in every relationship she has? Why do people feel the need to break people’s hearts? What is the mentality of these people? Why have these people been given the gift of life, when so many wonderful people have to die? Why God why?  Hmmm yes so anyways, now that is out of my system…………  Ooh yes my Marilyn Monroe Autobiography came today!!! Yay…cannot wait to read it!!  Am going to Brighton tomorrow, may have to be restrained in the vintage shop, imagine the possibilities!!  Thank You Haz, for my pretty picture!! Thank You Stef, for my beautiful drawing!! Thank You Kat, for my fantastico fairy!! Ooh and I bet you thought I had forgotten, Thank You Char for my lovely pictures (remember the fairies lol)   -	What have I done to deserve all these wonderful drawings that    people have done for me?  -	What have I done to deserve you wonderful people?  Love Nat  xXx
