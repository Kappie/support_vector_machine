With or without you With or without you  Through the storm we reach the shore You gave it all but I want more And I'm waiting for you  With or without you with or without you I can't live .with or without you  And you give yourself away.. and u gave yourself away.. And u give n u give N u give yourself away..  My hands are tired My body bruised, he's got me with Nothing left to win  And nothing left to lose  --By U2 The Joshua Tree album
