I guess because I read a couple of Jackie Collins' books before bed and dream about 'seemingly perfect marriages ending because the husband is cheating'.   So I'm doing stupid shit that I wouldn't normally do, and I think it might be just hormones and I'm DYING to talk about it with Hubby but he told me before that his ex-wife Terri the Whore used to accuse him of cheating too and I don't want to piss him off.   I look through his phone and he's still calling women from his old job that he doesn't work with anymore. Granted, some situations have arisen that make it necessary for him to still be in contact with him, but then again why would one of them text message him at like 9pm on the 4th of July telling him "Happy 4th, Be Safe"?  I'm reading more into that than I should, I know.   But then today I go to wake him up from his nap (he got home early today cause we have chilbirth class tonight) and there's this expensive looking JG Hook watch on the bed. I'm like, "HoneyBee, who's watch is this?" and he says "I don't know. Wake me up at 5."  The fuck?  You don't know whose watch it is? Did you find it somewhere? Don't you think it should be in the lost and found at work instead of on your wrist?  It looks brand new, too. I mean not a scratch anywhere on it.   Also, our sex life isn't great at all. He's given me reasons and everything, but when we're all alone why is it weird for him to have sex with me? We used to have sex like three times a night (for REAL) when we lived in Georgia and then we move out here and... nothing. But he's tired of having this discussion with me, because it makes him upset. Well goddamit I'm upset too.   And then, he's going to school (To Ft. Eustis, where I went to AIT) for 13 weeks to re-class, and I'm dreading it so much that I can't breathe sometimes when I think about it. Not only is he leaving me seemingly by myself (I'll still have family) with a new baby, but he's going to the same place I went to for AIT and I know that if there ever was a chance forhim to cheat it's there. I know how sex-hungry those AIT girls are, and how they'll try to seduce any man they can get their hands on... Hubby's a very attractive guy, so I know he's going to have pussy thrown at him from all sides. And I'll have no way of knowing. And the worst part is that I trust this man with my life but I'm SO paranoid about him cheating on me!!  I   hate   this. I really do. I've been cheated on by every man I've ever been with and if he's cheating on me I think I'd die.  I mean really I think I would die of a broken fucking heart.   Why is it, ladies, that we always think we aren't good enough to keep a man?  Right now I'm so huge and I feel so unattractive and right when I need constant affirmation that he still finds me attractive and desireable, he's like a block of ice-- a total 180 from how he was in Savannah-- and now all these weird things happening with the watch and his phone calls...   Someone hit me with a goddamn brick to knock some sense into me, or something. But this is all driving me crazy.  I can't wait for these hormones to dissipate so I can be normal again.   I'm crying. Fuck.  I'm so miserable today with this pregnancy and these hormones and these horrible thoughts in my head.  Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.   Good news is today CSAA called me for a job interview, and even offered to hold the job unitl October when I'm ready to put the baby in Daycare (6 weeks is old enough, right?) and then start my training and everything.  How awesome is that?  And I can't enjoy it cause I'm a paranoid stupid fucking bitch.   -Me
