Its not impossible but for a group of A.D.D people, it is quite difficult.  By the middle of the first we had all gotten up doing other stuff.  We did manage to watch the entirety of the second but barely.  Jarrett wanted to pillow fight at one point.  Then off to the movie theater to see the third movie. Im not saying it was bad but i just had a hard time not wanting to nodd off.  Nothing against the movie itself, guess you have to read the books to follow it. Anyway I had a blast hanging with everyone, now i am off to my grandma's then staying at aarons house. see yall around later.   Jenny
