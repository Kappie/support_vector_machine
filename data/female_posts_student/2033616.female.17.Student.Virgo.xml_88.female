I love Samford :-)... a year and a half and I'll be an Alabama resident for the first (much delayed) time in my life.  Well that's the plan anyway...  Actually when it comes to school right now i am very happy with it... aside from AP tests where i will crash and burn because i have never learned to study and i never really have studied though i desperatly need it b/c i have ZERO confidence in what knowledge i have retained over the course of this year.  (I typed that in one breath)  But otherwise it's all hunky dory.  I went to the counselor's office today and got my schedual changed for next year... NOOOOOOOOo to AP English yay to taking a ME class for the FIRST TIME SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL... aahh i loved middle school electives.  What better way to spend an entire class period that in an art room playing with paint?  So, now i am taking World Lit. with Hansen and Photography.  Oh next year will not be bad at all.  OOO boy.. i was REALLY lucky that everything fit my schedual... the counselor was shocked that it worked the first time!!  yay is me.  Back to my AP test thing... i have come to realize that the reason i'm not SUPER stressed... just semi stressed about them is because honestly, i'm okay with it if i don't pass.  That doesn't mean i'm not going to do my best, and that doesn't mean that i'm not going to TRY and work and study.  But I'm not going to go balistic over the tests.  I didn't take the classes for the college credit.  It would be wonderful, and I am very grateful that my parents have paid so much money for the tests... but I didn't take the classes because i want to slack off in college.  I took the classes because 1) I like them.  I've been taking acc classes, like many, since middle school and so why not?  School is so much more endurable when you are in an enviornment with people that are on your same level.  People in AP classes arn't asspiring to be the worlds biggest loser.  They all want to be there and are taking the class for their reasons, they have a reason to be there and they're not just forced.  2) I would gladly take a B in an AP or acc. class rather than an easy A in a regular class.  I get satisfaction from the fact that (though i admit, i slack off.. alot... esspecially lately) i work hard in those classes.  In chem, i handle really hard concepts, i feel like my brain might explode, but i think i like it like that.  3) I am interested in the subject.  I didn't take AP history because i love history, i took it because i wanted the harder route.  BUT, i didn't have to go on to AP chem.  Two years of chemistry are not required to graduate.  But, i like chem, i like science, i am a nerd and i LOVE to balance redox reactions.  (laura is dying of laughter now) 4) there is no 4.. but to make a long story longer.  I will be okay with myself if i don't pass all the tests in the end.  I'll be dissapointed in the begining no doubt... but in the long run, I'm already okay if i have to take chem in college, if i have to live through another history class.  TAKING ONE MORE CREDIT IN COLLEGE IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.  Phew... well i'm done... now maybe on to something productive... like homework?  Terribly sorry about the length  Did you know Samford has a Chick-fil-a ON campus IN their food court?  It's a beautiful thing  Lizzie
