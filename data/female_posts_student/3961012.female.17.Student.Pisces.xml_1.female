Michelle found it rather hillarious..for them to talk so long and suddenly hui yee asked "eh, what's ur name?"..      ok..enough said about stupid bus ride..   later that day...i went for swimming lesson....with kei...had lotsa fun there..instructor nearly killed us with laps and laps of practice...we wanted to sue him for child abuse..whether or not the police will actually accept our caseas child abuse is a different matter...   enough said for today..need to go offline to do my math mini project..but before that..let me tell u some "things" i saw..   a notice on the door of a shop selling hair care products(i think),   "for delivery, pls call xxxxxxxx, to get attention" (what attention..i wish to find out)   the malay version was funnier..   "sila hubungi xxxxxxxx untuk receiving"    both of them make equally as lil sense..   my friend said.."lets call the number and say 'eh, i want to receive attention'.."   ...   and the following notice is a contribution of my "beloved" math teacher which i have adopted the name ah chong for him...   "do discussion with your group members for the mini project..If found copy no mark"   I appreciate his thriftiness in saving his marker pen ink to save the environment (indirectly i think it does)...but seriously..   the notice can make more sense with a lil addition of words like..if found plagiarising, no marks will be awarded...   blek...   and "do discussion"?   aih..   and to think he once asked me, "do you understand english" for saying "i dont understand u, sir"   pls..who can understand him with his superb english   that's all for now..wont be bloggingat least for another four days..exams, ppl, EXAMS...
