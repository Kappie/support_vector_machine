How can you say you like me?  How can you say you love me?   Man: I really don't know the reason, but I can  prove that I love you.   Lady: Proof? No! I want you to tell me the  reason. My friend's boyfriend can tell her why  he loves her but not you!   Man: Ok ok!!! Erm... because you're beautiful,  because your voice is sweet,  because you are caring, because you are loving,  because you are thoughtful, because of your  smile, because of your every movements..   Unfortunately, a few days later, the Lady met  with an accident and became a vegetable. The Guy  then placed a letter by her side, and here is  the content:   Dearest,   Because of your sweet voice that I love you...  Now can you talk? No! Therefore I cannot love  you. Because of your care and concern that I  like you.. Now that you cannot show them,  therefore I cannot love you. Because of your  smile, because of your every movements that I  love you..  Now can you smile? Now can you move?  No, therefore I cannot love you...  If love needs a reason, like now,  there is no reason for me to love you anymore.  But does love need a reason?  I still love you... Because love doesn't need  one...
