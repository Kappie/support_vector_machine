I'll start with a brief on Physics today because this seems to be the theme of this blog in association with Insha and Matt (since we all sit at the same little table in Physics class). Let's see...didn't pay much attention in class again as usual, made fun of D's stupid facial expressions with Matt, brought an assortment of food to class (Hawaiian sweet bread, Pop-tarts, yogurt smoothie, naked juice, and a Balance Gold bar) so that I wouldn't be jealous of Howard and his abundance of food again, watched a video about waves, and studied for a math test that took place the following period. And today was unbearable weather...it was hotter than a fried burrito grilling on your mother's ass. It didn't help when the air conditioner decided to break down in the band room. On a happier note today, I got into my first car accident ever! Woohoo...in the CVMS parking lot, I was in line behind this lady who appeared to be moving forward, so I stepped on the gas. She braked very suddenly, and before I knew it, there was a car's ass in my face. She got out of the car with a bitchy look on her face, started cussing, yelling, and scolding me for hurting her car, and said, "You BETTER have insurance!" Right. Apparently she just got her car back from the repair shop after she was rear-ended in another accident a few weeks ago. Coincidence? I think not. Obviously, there's something fucky with her driving. So I handled the situation calmly, was very apologetic, and we exchanged information. Damage? Not a scratch on my car. A small outline of my license plate on her bumper. But she enjoyed venting her anger on me and cussing me out, so if she enjoys being that melodramatic, whatever. So that's my humble attempt at picking up some momentum in this blog. Hopefully since it's the three of us now, we can motivate each other enough to create a worthy blog. Howdy doo!  Post-script: I would like to point out something that has pissed me off forever. There is NO SUCH WORD as "NUCULAR." IT DOES NOT EXIST. The word is "nuclear," the pronunciation is "NEW-CLEAR," and not "NEW-KYOO-LER." Where in the fuck did that come from? I've noticed both students and teachers alike saying it like that. Not good. Stop.
