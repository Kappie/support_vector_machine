I tried watching American Wedding but my DVD player was being gay and didn't wanna play it. I was too lazy to go downstairs to Margaret's room and use her DVD player. She was on her way home so she probably wouldn't have wanted me in her room watching a DVD anyways. I was  really  upset with her though. I talked to her around 5ish yesterday and she said she'd be home between 8-9 for us to watch Uptown Girls. Well, finally  at 11  when she wasn't home yet, I called her and she told me  she fell asleep  at Kevin's. (her boyfriend's) I figured but it was just like, "What's new? I'm used to you blowing me off." I was gonna try to do these ab things but I didn't wanna wake my mom up. My mom was the one who gave me the magazine with the work out in it in the first place. I dunno why she did it though. Whenever I complain about myself, she always yells at me and says I'm beautiful the way I am. Well, geez.  I wish I felt beautiful.  Or I wish   someone else   could do that for me. So I just gave up and went to bed. It took me awhile to go to sleep because I had a lot on my mind. I  still  have a lot on my mind. I got up around 1:30 and painted the trim around my window with my mom. Then as I was getting dressed, I stepped in the paint stirrer thing so that was just great. I had a   blue   foot. Just after that I was in the kitchen with Eddie. I went to go give him a hug and he put me in a headlock. So I started pinching his sides and he didn't mean to but he jabbed his watch into my mouth. He let me go and I went to go look in the mirror. I saw my gums were bleeding but I was cool with it. I went to tell Eddie that my gums were bleeding and he's like, "Maybe you shouldn't brush your teeth so hard then..." He was just being a smartass but I still love him! After that I went down the street and delivered some pictures to people for Mrs. Laboda. Hey, easy work and I get a service hour for it. I came home, read CH 5 of Tom Sawyer, and then started reading Cosmogirl. So I decided to eat something before soccer. Eddie wanted to eat before work too so we just ended up eating together. As usual, I was just talking aimlessly and Eddie shakes his head and says, "I just wanted to relax and have everything silent before work." And I say, "Then why'd you eat w/ me? You know I don't shut up." So we just joked around and he left for work. I got ready for soccer and left. I went to the high school because that's where practice was (at least I was told that) but no one was there. So I started getting my panic attack feelings and I went to Orlando.  Luckily , everyone was there. So I started to breath easier. But then I realized I was the  only  girl. And the panic came back. If Cody wasn't so nice and easy to talk to I would have just stood off to the side by  myself  and not talked to anyone. Eventually, Carly and Nikki both came so that was good. Mr. Willis wasn't there for awhile but when he got there, he didn't say anything to us and just sat on a swing. It was strange. Then we ran our warm up lap, stretched, and did three on a ball. For some reason, it wasn't that hard today. But I felt like I couldn't sprint. It felt like I was just jogging but I was running my hardest. Next, we found out that there was some  random  guy in the parking lot with papers in his lap,  just watching us.  So we couldn't touch the balls because it would have been illegal and we all would have gotten into  a lot  of trouble I guess. So we couldn't scrimmage or anything with the ball. Then we had a little chat. We talked about the levying failing and the rules that had changed and all that fun stuff. Practice ended early but I stayed with most of the team to scrimmage and mess around. It kinda sucked because  I wasn't even picked  for a team. They threw me on a team. And then I know the two guys were saying shit about me because they kept saying "she" and looking at me. Ah. It sucks. I feel so  worthless  sometimes. Sometimes I just wonder  why I even try in the first place...  There's no point. After most of the people left, we played World Cup. In the beginning it sucked because I had no one to be on a team with, so I asked Lucas to be my partner and he wouldn't answer me. He had no partner either! And everyone else was paired up so it was like WTF? Why can't you just be my partner? I'm starting to not like him very much. Towards the end of World Cup it got better. I was doing better. I even scored. And it was a good kick if I do say so myself. (happy face) But then Matt stepped on my foot. The foot that has been hurting like a mother for the past week. It's strange. It's just the top of my foot. It hurts when I walk and even sometimes when I'm not moving it at all. But it's hurt even more when I run. So after Matt stepping on it, it was pretty numb. And then Nick or Anthony ( I CAN'T TELL EM APART!)  kicked it. So that was just great. A little later Alex came to give Carly, Dominik, and me a ride home since he got his license. I came home and talked to Margaret about my foot and she said it looked swollen. (sad face) Then she said, "That's what happened to me. I fractured two bones in the top of my foot. I had to wear one of those crazy shoes and I could  never  run again. It hurt too much to." She was like  a star  cross country girl. So me being  the worrier I am , I began to freak out. If I had to stop running all together, I'd go crazy. Not being able to play soccer  would kill me.  So that lead me to lock myself in the bathroom and cry for a little bit. Among other things. I kept hinting towards Margaret that I wanted to talk about  "it"  but she was too busy to pay attention. I was dropping clues all night but she never picked up on them. So I'm just gonna talk to Maura about it all tomorrow. While I was at soccer, I talked to Margaret and she asked me if it was okay if Kevin joined in on the  girls'  night. I  acted  like I was totally fine with it but it upset me. I wanted to hang out  with her  and watch a movie  with her.  Not with Kevin too. Don't get me wrong. I love Kevin. It's just I love my sister too and sometimes I like to spend quality alone time with her. Which we haven't done in a  long, long time.  So the three of us ended up watching it. The two of them cuddled up on the couch and me  all alone  on the other one. That's what  killed  me. Seeing the two of them snuggling up together,  so happy.  All I want is that. I  just want to be in love and have someone love me again.  I mean, is that so much to ask? I'm a very impatient girl so don't tell me, eventually I'll find the one. I know that, I just wish he'd hurry up already. Uptown Girls, it was cute. But I didn't really like it. It just  ended . No explanation. Nothing. I don't like those kind of things that don't explain the endings. Then I came upstairs and showered. I feel like crap. I have a terrible headache. My tummy hurts. All I hate today was fruit loops for breakfast, some taco crap before soccer, a muffin, and some rice when I got home. Okay, so I ate like a half a bag of chips, it's not healthy... I didn't even to my crunches today because I've been so blah. There's nothing to do online and no one is really on to talk to so I guess I'm gonna go to bed. It's gonna take me  a long time  to fall asleep.  I might cry  my way to sleep or I might now. Right now, I'm leaning towards it. But just let me remind you, I have the hardest time trying to sleep when I have  all these thoughts running through my head...  One last thought: Figure out what you want because I don't like playing your games. You should know who you are. Good night~      P.S. I wish I would have went to PA for the week. God, it would have been better than dealing with this shit...
