I didn't do much today except for wait in line at the DMV for about an hour and a half... But I got my actual plastic driver's license today, so that was good. My picture sucks, but there is no such thing as a decent picture of me anyways. Oh well. After arriving home, we had some food from Burger King for lunch, and I went outside to mow the lawn. It was a very nice day, a little breezy at times. Anyways, I actually watched TV tonight, which is something I almost never do. I watched the 2004 Nathan's hot dog eating contest on ESPN. That was both interesting and disturbing. I also watched this X-Games (blah) surf contest with Kelly Slater and Taj Burrow and Corey Lopez and some other awesome surfers; it was scored like a basketball game, but much more complexly, which was strange. I then proceeded to watch a rerun of the tennis match between Roddick and Kiefer because one can never get enough of Andy Roddick. So that was all.      Last song I listened to:   Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger  by Daft Punk.   Last album I listened to:   Discovery .   Last meal I ate:  A Whopper and fries from Burger King :P.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Ugh... Band camp begins on Tuesday of next week.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Dan.   Favorite song today:   Clair De Lune  by Claude Debussy.   Favorite food today:  I don't know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Got my driver's license.   Funniest thing that happened today:  I don't recall anything especially hilarious taking place today.
