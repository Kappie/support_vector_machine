WE HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME!! OMG!! she's like the sweetest girl! and we had fun staying up until 3am eating lucky charms and talking online to my friends who she thinks are hot..haha yeah so do i C. We did a lot of fun things like umm..we went to Alabama shopping! OMG thats a story...so we're in Alabama in this huge mall, not the largest in this city (Huntsville) but one of the largest, bigger than Hanes mall. Anyways, so we're shopping in AE and Aero. , and omg my aunt gale totally went all out and bought me like EVERYTHING i wanted..yay. lol i got some pants and shirts. then we went to Aero. and got some more stuff. fun times there. We were headed to Dillards to look at some shoes for Kayre and theres this huge storm outside and all the sudden they call torando! hahaha omg, this place is known for its torandos. so...we all had to go to the bottom level of Dillards at the makeup counter cuz its the "safe loction" of the mall. haha We stood there for like 35-40mins until the torando went away. haha i also took a pic of us standing in Dillards. i now have a pic and i can say "this is me shopping in Alabama during a torando" haha yay! We had a great time. Today i actually got to meet some of C's friends. boy do her friends have WEIRD ass names like Alton (not really weird..), Stiles and Battle. Alton is my age and is a skater kid..hes soooo HOT and Stiles is like a normal dark red headed kid who lives up the road from C and Battle is kinda cute...nice name though. and there was this other hot skater named Braiden. ooo lala. he was playing golf in skater clothes LMAO! bam margera shoes too. :p oh and um..we went and met up with them at the country club. we sat with Brittany and Catherine (ugh that name..) as they laid out in the sun by the pool. we just stopped by for a min before C's denist appointment. anyways..it was fun.    I went and got my pics developed and im tempted to stick my "skater girl" pic up in here..just cuz i think its funny how im standin by a fountain lookin like an idiot..its a stupid pic. the wind was blowing and my hair is EVERYWHERE..but oh well...u know what i just noticed? BLOGGER did change the whole post setup!! OMG im soo smart!! this is cool stuff now..woo hoo! hmm i would put that pic in here..but idk how! so yay..    Lets see..im excited to go back home in ONE MORE DAY! thank u jesus! Tonite i went and bought another shirt from AE and got some "flavored chicken wings" ive never had those..umm but the Teryiki ones are good. lol and umm..i bought a bag of cherries! yays and some berry mints from AE too, i love their mints! UBER GOOD.    LALALALA i love skaters!! LALALALA omg, brandon, the boy bailey dumped joe for, and never dated..is HOT! omg..brandon is good lookin. lol looks like a skater but is a prep. best of both worlds. i told joe i thought B was a cutie and he got mad...but i heard he plays that stupid Magic Card game..thats like really gay..my bros used to play it. umm..that doesnt work. i'm still stickin with danny. lol *please o please o please let me get danny*    Oh and C's friends are all the really pretty voted most popular chicks..they're really nice though, but i guess it's true if ur a cheerleader then that comes with the package, cuz i mean Caroline is really nice and pretty and sweet and outgoing, but doesnt strike me as someone like that...but anyways, rock on! ...gawd did i just judge? i did..shame on me.    i talked to good old clement today. he asked me when i was gonna get drunk with him and i told him i was comin home early and he was all happy. He still wants katie to come and party with us..umm..no..im like "well i guess u and katie can just party together" and hes like "no u gotta come too" well it sounds to me u lil mother fuckin punk u just want KATIE and dont care if im there or not. fuck that, i hate being used to get to KATIE. and KATIE doesnt even wanna TALK to u..gawd u phreak.    im really glad im friends with jordan (a friend of sarah sampson) . shes soo nice and like she was tellin me how she only has one girl friend (sarah) cuz she hates "bitches" and she fights all the time, but she really loves and cares about the friends she has..and shes like "u could do anything to me and i wouldnt lay a hand on u! execpt if u fucked my bf..if u or sarah did i'd kill ya" haha shes had a hard life, but shes doin great. already outta school and in college this fall, and shes 16! and doesnt have a baby. shes awesome, i cant wait to hang out with her and sarah! :p even though they will both prob get me in deep shit. lol    WHY AM I ALWAYS LABELED THE "SWEET ONE" i mean, u ask guys what type of girl i am and its "sweet"...like nathan just said "ur just the girl i need, but wrong type" WTF..type? so i asked him..and im the sweet one, u know how many people have said that?! i dont wanna be SWEET all the time! he wants someone dirty..well hell, i dont know how to be a "dirty type" execpt screw em and im not home! and i wouldnt screw him anyways..    Thats all the important stuff i can think of right now...    *much love and get um*
