Sandra Diaz-Twine , the 29-year-old office assistant from Ft. Lewis, Washington, captured the million-dollar prize. In the gut-wrenching final Tribal Council, Sandra pleaded to the Jury that she went along with whatever alliance would have her without asking questions. Sandra claimed she never got in anyone's way, staying quietly in the background, and that she deserved to be the Sole Survivor. The Jury agreed in a  6 to 1 decision , making Sandra the Sole Survivor and the recipient of the one million dollar prize.    urlLink More...    SURVIVOR  was TEH B3ST! I was hoping that Darrah or Sandra would win, and Sandra did. She definitely deserved the million dollars. I respect her utmostly, especially her incredibly truthful and straightforward personality. In addition, she is the only sole survivor in the  entire  series who has NOT EVEN  ONE  vote casted against her!!! Amazed? YES!  I hate to be judged so I try my outmost best not to judge people... as I always believe there is more to the physical. Like what Shaun has mentioned, there seems to be different aspects of depiction of every character in the game. For example, the more triumph moments of RUPERT BONEHAM!
