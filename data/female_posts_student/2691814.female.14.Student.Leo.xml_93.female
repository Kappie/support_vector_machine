She's so out of it....she'd fall asleep when she'd be in the middle of a sentence....she'd say things are somewhere but their not...she'll make up things in her mind and like just completely make no sence. Atleast the nurses are nice...they drew blood from her and the nurses actually talked with me and keith lol. That was maybe the good part...plus we all watched jeopardy.  i had a prreety bad day. I mean...it wasn't ALL bad but just the lil things lol. I skipped dance practice today...i wanted to take it easy...i didn't want anyone to get on my case about not knowing the dance...so talked to mrs. walker about stuff...she still has my poems in her classroom lol. But...in math i have a D so thats gonna be on my mid term....and i cut my arm on the bus...and then in the hospital i spilt coke all over me lol. It makes me laugh at it more than mad at it. Well now i smell like hospital so im gonna go take a shower.
