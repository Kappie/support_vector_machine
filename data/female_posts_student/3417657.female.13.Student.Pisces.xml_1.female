Then i got off called Brooke. She talked about school and stuff and her lover Preston. She says she doesn't like him. But i know she does. Ya that was funny. Then me and Robert (my stepdad) went 2 Lowe's we bought some stuff for the house. Ya there was this guy that worked there. He was hott. Lol. Ya now I'm at home listening 2 music, thinking and reading my mail from Doug. Interesting stuff huh Alex? Haha. Garrett's on but he's really not talking guess he's busy in the chat room. i'm gonna miss him. He won't be back until wedsnday!I doubt he'll miss me.It's 9:37 and I'm not tired. I don't wanna go 2 school 2morrow. But maybe something will happen. Haha like on Friday when Sean had that stink bomb. ya that was funny did i mention that Sean....nvm. hah. Anyway i must go.
