When I take the time to think about how he acts around me, I can't help but think that he kinda likes me.  The thing is that he hasn't made a move.  Maybe I'm misinterpreting his signals.  Maybe I have no idea how a guy who likes me should act.  Maybe I just have no idea how to approach the situation.  I honestly feel like I'm not meant to find love, to find happiness.  Why can't I find someone who cares about me, who I also care about.  It seems like the ones who I long for are just out of reach.  Everytime I like a guy, I'll come so close, then they are ripped away from me.  This time he hasn't be taken away from me yet, but I can't help but think that it's soon to happen.   I may be confused because of him.  Around random people and my friends he's cute, friendly and he even flirts with me, but when his friends are around, he barely even talks to me. In class he's always looking over at me, but when he sees me at lunch be hardly even realizes I'm there.  Is he being an asshole, is he shy, does he like me at all?  I don't know what to make of this.  I wish he weren't worth my time, but I know that if something did happen, it would be very worth my time.
