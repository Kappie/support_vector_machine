And come sunday it will feel like monday, but it won't be.  I'll have another full day off to enjoy.    I got a call from this guy Skye, he's in a band.  I was going to audition to be the lead singer, but I told him I wouldn't because I didn't want to be the cause of a shitty position if my stupid car decides it doesn't give a fuck about my having to work and go to school.  I called Kevin again and I know he wanted to abandon all of his customer service etiquette.  But I had to know somethings before I let him fix my car.  I hate not being able to trust people.  I'm so happy to be off work.  So happy.    I don't think we're doing anything this weekend for Bobin's birthday.     Nikol, I left you a vm letting you know.
