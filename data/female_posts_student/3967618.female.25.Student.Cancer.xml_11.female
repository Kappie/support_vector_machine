I decided at one point to try to win her over by complementing her.  After that, she sent me this email that was multi-dimentional, it had flying objects and the strangest juxtopositioning of words.  Although I knew that this note meant that that she liked me, I had a chill as I realized that she was completely insane. I woke up after that.
