Oh,  Adam , I love you so, You would look cute with a fro, Put me on a little show, To you, I could never say no.  Oh,  Adam , your face was sent from above, Your eyes are filled with the purest of love, You have the beauty of a graceful dove, Put on your sexy rubber gloves!  Oh,  Adam , please say my name, Hold me close, and keep me sane, Keep me away from all the pain, Maybe make out with me in the rain?  Oh,  Adam , I have to go, But all I really want you to know, Is that I'll always love you so, I'll always love you,  Adam Bro .      I wrote that. I bet it makes you want to have an orgasm.
