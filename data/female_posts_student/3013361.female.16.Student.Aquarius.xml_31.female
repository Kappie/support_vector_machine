I had a thought the other day. I've decided I want to change. I don't want to be a mean bitter person. I want to be happy and I am happy. Recently I've realized all the great things in my life and how blessed I am to have great friends and a family that loves me and would do anything for me. Recently I've just been happy and it feels like nothing in the world could upset me. I love it. I wish I could tell everyone how to live like this and how I've achieved this extreme happiness but I really don't know, it just happened. I'm so happy right now I could fly but I'm pretty sure I don't know how so I'm not gonna try that right now.
