We heard on the news all weekend that it snowed like 8 inches up here and we get back and there is not ONE FREAKIN' FLAKE!!!  And I was really excited about getting out of school, too.  *sigh* Ah, well.  Hope we didn't have homework.  That could be bad.  Oh, and big ol' W00T cause Abby called me and we talked for like an hour.  She is off phone and computer restrictions so we have the communication up and rolling.  Life is (semi) good again.  I was really going through some major Abby-withdrawals.  But it seems we have come through it okay.  Maybe I can actually SEE her sometime within the next week. That would be good.  I missed her.
