I looked up Oliver Cromwell on the internet last night seeing as i blanked on what he accomplished. that sort of freaked me out. school is over... hello! oh well, i guess my curiosity never ends no matter what it is i'm curious about. i want to go shopping. i want to travel. i want to leave texas. i hate it here. oh well, i'm convinced that i will enjoy my summer this year, no one will spoil this. i'd better go. i should be cleaning my room. and listening to flogging molly.
