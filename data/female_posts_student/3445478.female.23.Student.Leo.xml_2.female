When we got home-after I dropped my hot(cold) chocolate on the ground-there was a package for Nick, from Mimi. "Mimi" is a nickname of my dad's grilfriend Carol. Enclosed was the most beautiful knit green sweater vest. I love it sooooo much! I hurried  feed Nick just so I could put it on him and take pictures. Later on, Nick  I went to Grampsie/Gramsie Koski's for Uncle Bill's birthday party while Shawn went out with his buddy, Charlie.  Pretty full day. Nick has been in such a good relaxed mood all day!-very easy going which is unusual for him ;)  Shots are comming up next Wednesday! Poor Nick! Thank Gosh Grandma Lu is coming with us because Shawn will be in the cities starting his internship. I am not looking forward to Nick's shots at all. I can hardly stand taking my "shewster", Keely's cat (Puddy) to the vet without getting dizzy!-Empathy.  Tomorrow is going to be great. Shawn has the whole day off! I can't wait to spend time with him.
