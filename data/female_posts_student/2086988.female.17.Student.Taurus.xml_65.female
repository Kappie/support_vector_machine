Fun stuff yo. It happens!   Wow, I'm so bored and even though I have aLOt of homework, I'm not going to do it. At this point, I really don't care anymore.  So I read  Girl with the Pearl Earring , it is really good. I can't wait to see the movie. I love the sex parts, lol, they're so suttle yet detailed. It's CrAZy. At least I have my ROR book read. Now, I just have to finish reading  The Great Gatsby . Learn my lines for theatre, do this Alg 2 worksheet that I don't know how to do, and couldn't even do it because I don't have a graphing calculator, and write my pre-lab for chemistry. All I gotta say is, "I don't wanna!"   Turning and returning to some secret place to hide  Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say  Take my breath away
