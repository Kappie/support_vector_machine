I was SO bored there and everyone in the room with me were like...younger than me and I was so bored. You can't imagine how PAINFUL it was and how MUCH I CRIED!!! Alas I still got to return home today...I couldn't imagine ONE MORE DAY THERE! THE HORROR! Anyway, most of my friends were like 'what da hell happnd?' believe me...they SO need to improve on they're spelling :P    Well, I was quite happy that some of my friends did call me. But me falling sick...I only can blame it on..RESHMIN! She's my future-sis-in-law :P Lets just say I fell for her brother :P Totally weird eh? Anyway...she can be a good friend...sometimes, the best part is, she's a prefect and I get to get away with all my wrong doing :P Oopsie! Well, I think I need to rest now, chiow!
