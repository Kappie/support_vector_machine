It's Saturday, yah, but even that is waning, making life horrible.  Yes, I live with all girls, and in context, PMS stands for PreMondaySyndrome. It's massive depression marked by the onset of a new week, mostly on Sundays but auspiciously clear in the slow points of really good weekends.  My dad almost got robbed today. He was asleep and the back door was open, then he heard movement and screamed, "HEY!", and whoever it was ran out and slammed the door...nothing was taken. It's also all my fault since I took Katie to Guard this morning and, in our hurry, we left the door unlocked. I felt horrible, and still do, considering. Of course, da doesn't care.  He also just happened to come across a copy of the movie  Memento  on Friday, so we're going to watch that here in a second. Just happened to, mind, I didn't even tell him about Psychology, and suddenly he goes, "I got this movie called "Memento", it came out awhile back..." And then I told him the whole plot of the movie, the life story of the guy, his brain damage, his credit card numbers, and other cooler stuff, and dad was just sitting there going, "Uh...that's cool."  I drove about a hundred miles today, it was badass. I went to Opry Mills and bought a really cool toboggan, which happens to be really cool, albeit a plain, black colour. Guess whar I got it from.  And I heard CHINGY on the way home, and I cried when he said, "POKEchop." It, too, was sweet.   Y tu mama, tambien. OOH BIOTCH. Heheheh. That's the name of some Latin specialty movie I always see in the new releases at Blockbuster, even tho it's been out for the better part of two years. Just the fact that it says, "And your mom too" is really frickin' cool. It would be even better if "biotch" were attached on there, too.  And...the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza from Domino's is...eh. It's ok. It's a bit hard to chew. It also tastes weird, like...part pizza, and part philly cheese steak. It makes for an interesting conflagration. Not to mention my intestines are screaming for death cuz of all the grease thereby.  Caffeine ist bad. Reichstag. And other German stuff.  Farewell friends.
