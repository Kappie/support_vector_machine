Oh well... cant change the past so I guess I'm gonna have to learn from my mistakes. anyway, tje most positive aspects of my life are the moment are; 1. the exams are over. 2. lucy. There arent anymore. I've discovered that i can't communicate through words.. I have to either write down my thoughts or put them on here. People seem to think that I am really hard and that I can cope with anything.. but being completely honest, I cant.. its all an act. I know I joke about my experiences with counselling and seem reluctant to go, but before I actually went I was full of hope because I thought that maybe this would be the way to sort me out. Now I know it hasnt worked and I dont know where to go from here. I am stuck on a downwards spiral and I cant get out of it, because I dont know how.I thoguht counselling might help me but it didnt so now I'm all out of hope. At the moment I feel as though I dont actually have any true friends.. I get on with alot of people because I have to.. I'm not going any further in to it (christie this doesnt include you, I get on with you because i want to). I feel as though noone really cares about me anymore. Everyone thinks I've got past it, but I havnt, it gets worse and worse every day. Everyone around me seems to be so happy all the time, so I pretend to avoid bringing others down. i bottle everything up so everyone thinks I'm ok, but deep down it hurts so much. Noone seems to realise that I am puttin gon this huge act so that people like me. People are only interested in the old kaz who was always making jokes and having fun, and i am trying so hard to be like that, but I always know that deep down thats not how i'm feeling. It's like I'm hiding behind a mask and noone can see behind it, and hardly anyone even realises its there. I cant talk about it properly because I find it really hard to get the words out. I hate pretending all the time. I feel so alone, like noone understands me. Sometimes I have to get out of my room because i am so scared of what I might do to myself if i stay there any longer. had a huge argumet with christie but i think thats on its way to being sorted out and its going to make our friendship alot stronger. instead of talking to anyone about it though, I took it out on myself. I dont know why i do it though. I get this thought in my head andI have to do it. i have to punish myself for being such an idiot. I dont know why, I just cant help it.I know i need to do something about it, but counselling didnt work, and now I'm all out of ideas. I am stuck here in this time of my life and i cant see the end of it. I cant see there being a future.. itjust seems as though i'm never gonna be who I used to be again. I hate who I am at the moment more than I  hate muriel and thats saying something gotta go
