First Lisa's grandpa died, then Devins grandma and now my great aunt who was basically my grandma since she died.  Things are very stressful right now I can't go to the funeral I have to stay home because of dance and choir so my contribute to cancer is to do the relay for life.  If anyone wants to sponsor me that would be GREAT! It just hit me now that I am NEVER going to see her again and she meant so much to me and for some reason when my mom told me today I didn't cry when I told rhiannon or michelle I didn't cry when I told my sister and she was freaking out I didn't cry at all! But now I can't stop I don't know what it is maybe it is that I have to make stupid cookies and go to dance and miss two days of school but god why does this have to keep happening?! I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me but I need to stop crying somehow and this is the best way to do it is to let it all out on the internet for the world to see.  I just want people to stop dying I want cancer to go away and never come back and I don't know but today at a meeting we were talking about people who have died and I didn't even start crying then! Like I just don't know what it is!  I don't want to anything anymore I just want to sit on my couch and watch TV. I don't want to go to dance tonight or make cookies! I HATE BAKING!!! Oh well live will go on I feel a bit better Later gator!
