I can't believe its been six months since he passed. I can't even believe really that he has passed. When I think of him I just think that he's still away at school and I get ready to ask my brother something about him and then I remember.   The last six months have been an interesting one. So much has happened, but so much has stayed the same. Something in my brother is different though, as obviously he's lost his best freind. In the last year he's lost more of his innocence and naievete than he should have had to. He's not innocent by any means, but he's really had a rough year and his choices don't seem to be getting any better. Especially his new taste in freinds. They're awful people. Its easy to say that John was much better a friend now that he's passed, but seriously, we knew John forever and we knew he was good people and I guess that made it easier for us to overlook his flaws, but John was a good person.   I'm sorry that this is kind of a downer entry, but I just needed to write this. John, please keep looking out for Jay, he needs your guidance more now than he ever has and we all miss you and you often cross our minds. R.I.P.
