Every other word was a swear, something I never expected from her.  Not that I'm being condescending, to each its own, but she used to be so proper, always afraid of breaking the rules.  Now she's like watch out baby!    I'm going over to Tom's tonight to watch Secret Window.  I'm going to miss that kid when he leaves.
