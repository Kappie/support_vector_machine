I was yawning all the way to the parade square and when forming the contingent. The downside was that I had to stand in front. What's worse was that my form teacher kept looking at me as he could not look for my other classmates... *Ggrrrr* The devotion was long, the GB Day speech was long and the announcement was ssssoooo long.... And one of our girls fainted. So embarrassing. I mean, at least squat down, don't fall right onto the ground. It was so loud and at least 4- 5 teachers went to her aid. Jeezz... Nobody was treated like her, ya know... massage by the captain, hot drink and she took off her hat. If any girls faint, we only had water to drink and sit down on the floor. So unfair. I never even once fainted during drill or any event... I really do not know if it is lucky or unfortunate. But I really hope that any uniform groups students, please eat breakfast. If you know you can't tahan without breakfast, PLEASE EAT!
