When I woke up I wasn't wearing them, and I have been wandering around the house for a while and haven't been able to find them anywhere. :/  My feet are back to normal size now. Yay! hehe  Ok, so more about camp... For the Charter's council circle they did a "never been done" which was having a cop come in and "arrest" Jimmy Russel (a counselor) and hand cuff him to a tree.  Oh my god. So funny! Later Ryan Frankenberry (another counselor) was handcuffed beside Russel... tehehe... So great!  I  finally  learned some line dances! Yay! That makes me so happy...  I'm still pretty bad at them, but I might consider going to Dance Weekend next year.... Maybe...  I have to be at the Extension Office at 5:30 tomorrow morning to get on the bus. Yay! I'm so excited! :)  I just wish Matt was going to some state camps.. He was even chosen to be an out-of-state delgate to another state's 4-H camp, and he's not going to that. Bah.  Stop it Ash...
