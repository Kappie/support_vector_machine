Her almond shaped eyes so honest, I know she's lying. And depending upon how she feels, her eyes will shift colors, from gray to soft blue. You'd be surprised but within moments I can make it happen so that I can see those spectrum of colors. From fine to annoyed, to hurt, bridging over to anger, fear, and then finally, defeat.    Black out. I look at her stiff body, shallow breathing, as if I couldn't notice her still there. Sometimes clothes off, her fair skin, freckled shoulders and covered eyes. I say endearingly, " I'm a monster, daddy's a monster isn't he?" She replies "no," but I know I am one. I feel it. Then my rage quickly returns as if unbroken.    I want to kill her. Instead of light skin, I see drained sullen skin. And the freckles speckled upon her shoulders are now splatters of blood that I have painted all over her body.    There's no control over it. One second I'm stroking her soft, wavy, tendriled hair and the next...I'm sliding my hands over her broad motionless shoulders, back up her neck, and I want to squeeze until her lips are a lifeless purple and she's more silent than the existance she has made in my life.
