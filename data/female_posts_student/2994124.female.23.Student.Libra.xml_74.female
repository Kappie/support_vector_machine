Only snag- have written 2000 of the 3000 words (6 pages of 10 for you Canadians!) but haven’t really done the main body yet!! But at least I have some stuff down which is the hardest part. I just find it really hard to sit and write continuously though.  Like I get so bogged down in the detail and I get myself confused. I don’t know how Melanie writes like 20 pages in 2 days. But the topic I have chosen really fascinates and annoys me. I find myself shouting out loud about the injustices and stuff as I’m writing it!!  The title is:   ‘The big bad pharmaceutical companies’??  Comparing and contrasting access to antiretroviral drugs for women for the treatment of HIV and AIDS in Uganda and the United Kingdom.    Oh am not impressed – got Rob right for winning one of the challenges but got Big Tom wrong.  Bet you Melanie is pleased that Rupert didn’t go – maybe he is still in with a chance of becoming the Sole Survivor!  Is next week the last episode?   Am going to pick up Hannah from school and take her to ballet. Jo and the baby are coming home from hospital today - yipee! mexx
