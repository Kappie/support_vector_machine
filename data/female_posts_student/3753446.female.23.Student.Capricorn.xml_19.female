Healthwise, I'm feeling better, much better than before anyway, but inside I'm freaking out about medical school applications and catching up with classes. I'm trying to be patient with myself and just take things day by day, but it would definitely be nice if I relaxed a little more. Just need to chill! I've missed a lot of class since I've been sick, and being the overachiever I will embarrassingly admit to being, it's hard for me to just give in and say, "Hey, i need more time" or "I need to be excused from this" when I'm so sick of being sick!  Luckily, my throat pain has subsided, fever is long gone, I'm fully decongested again, and my appetite has returned (somewhat). All I have left of mono now is a nagging need for a nap about three times a day and an inability to walk more than 400 yds without breaking a sweat. This is, of course, a significant debilitator to my everyday activities, so it's something to which I'm still getting accustomed.  On the bright side, I have learned so much from these events. Our health is so precious, and so basic to our ability to function at our best. There is definitely a reason that basic human needs: food, water, shelter, security, and health, are at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy and self-actualization is at the top.  Mono is just a minor illness--inconvenient yes, but still minor--on the grand spectrum of pathology, and it has managed to teach me this. As a result, I am further impressed by the strength and resilience exhibited by people who deal with more severe chronic illness. At times, by comparison, I feel like a wuss for being such a whiney, cranky, sleepy, sick person whenever I shuffled from my bed to one of three places--1) the computer, 2)the RA microfridge, or 3) the bathroom--and back again a couple of times a day. :) Don't worry, this wuss is going to tough it out! I'll still be nice to my body though.  So.. I was incapacitated for a while, but I'm getting back on my feet, and now the mountains of work that I ignored all this time are screaming for attention. Pray for me. I need strength!
