Friday: i watched a stars game that we lost to Minnesota 4-2 because my parents wouldn't let me go anywhere.  Saturday: I slept really late and i ate junk food.  I wanted to go see "The Prince and Me" but nobody could go cause everyone's broke.  So i went to Lindsay's house and we watched "The Shining".  It was a freaking scary movie, i couldn't sleep very well that night.  It reminded me alot of Ghost Ship.  The Ring is still the scariest movie i've ever seen.  There were the twins in the shining that were really freaky and then the elevators let out this wave of blood....it was pretty nasty.  Luckily, in the end, the mom and boy got away from the crazy dad and it was a pseudo-happy ending.  There were some really funny parts in that movie though!  Like when the kid's second personality started talking, he talked with his finger.  We though something lived in his finger!!  Or when the mom ran away from stuff, she ran really weird.  Then there was this one part where the mom was running up the stairs looking for her son and she looks into this one room  and there's this guy dressed up in a MOUSE SUIT (like the guy who is the spoof character of Chewbacca in Space Balls) giving oral sex to Lloyd, the ghost bartender!!!!!!  That was soooo random and LSD-induced.....it had absolutely nothing to do with the story.  Oh but not to mention the part where the crazy dad is making out with this random COMPLETELY NAKED woman he finds in the bathroom and then he looks up and she's all moldy and DEAD!!!  And then she chases him out of the room, STILL COMPLETELY NAKED with her boobs hanging down by her waist.......omg it was soo disgusting.  I am seriously scarred for life.  So yeah i didn't sleep too well that night.  Sunday: I went out to lunch at the Deliman's grill with the family and as i was walking out i saw ADAM HAVENS walking in.  Not that he took a glance my way or anything, but he looked sooooo hot.  I love his hair, he shouldn't ever cut it.  Yeah so after that exciting bit, i went to the stars game in which i saw Emily and Lauren and their family.  It was out last stars game together before Lauren goes to college! *tear*  So we yelled and everything and totally made foold of ourselves.  They were mad that they didn't get to see my hockey team last game, lol you guys missed out!  During the intermission, i was buying ice cream with Em and Lauren and then this random guy comes and taps me on the shoulder.  I was wearing my Niko Kapanen Jersey and he asks "Now, out of all of the guys on team why did you choose to wear Kapanen's jersey?".  I said "Because i think he's cute?", i was really freaked out by this guy but he chuckled at me.  And i decided to make myself not look like such a puck bunny by saying "well he's also a really good player and i've liked him for awhile....he's my favorite!".  Em and Lauren also helped out by adding that i'm obsessed with him and i'm in love with his hair.  Thanks guys.  This guy thought that was funny and he says "Well, i'm in marketing for the stars and i just noticed your jersey and thought i'd ask about it......not many people wear this jersey and we're just trying to figure out what the fans want".  I told him that i'm probably the only person outside of Finland who wears his jersey and he thought that was funny.  He asked me if i liked Niko's hair etc and i said "yeah i love it and if you could pass on the message to him, tell him to never ever cut it all off".  lol he said ok he would try!  yaay, life is complete.  btw, stars won today 5-2 over Chicago.  lol, fun weekend eh? too bad that my 4-day weekend is completely taken up because we're going to visit family that hates me.  oh joy.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
