A hand cradled in his face she looked him in the eye She finally broke silence on the day she was about to die "I'm sorry to say, that I can't stay with you anymore," "I'm sorry the times with you i missed the dusk and dawn"  Tears from a family wept pools around him She felt as if her heart was about to sink "Honey don't cry, I loved you the day i married you," "I'll just be going home to God, one day you'll join me too."  She thought of her unrequited love How he's going to leave for the heavens above "How I wished you knew that I've been loving you all the time," "I'll keep on loving you till God cuts my line."  How it seems to funny when we break the silence when we lose someone We never know how much we loved and were loved till be break the run Too many words unspoken yet we let time slip away Don't be unspoken or you'll wondering at the place you'll lay      Written by Drifting Heart
