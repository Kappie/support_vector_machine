"The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket."  auld lang syne.  green fig tree.  "This kind of detail impressed me. It suggested a whole life of marvelous, elaborate decadence that attracted me like a magnet."  "after doreen left, i wondered why i couldn't go the whole way doing what i should anymore. this made me sad and tired. then i wondered why i couldn't go the whole way doing what i shouldn't, the way doreen did, and this made me even sadder and more tired."  last thought of the night: when in doubt, resort to vagueness. it works for astrology, it will work for you.
