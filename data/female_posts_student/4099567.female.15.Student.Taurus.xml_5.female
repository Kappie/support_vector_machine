So, I spent much of the ride there disgusted by a complicated tapestry of vomit stories from a fyfer named Jack, but then it looked brighter. We pitched tents, and I must say, the other three girls and I had a very nice tent when compared with the "Circus Tent". The Circus Tent is what the four guys used. It was an old canvas tent colored in a sickly green and acidic yellow with a nice metal crown on top, which was lovely considering the lightning storms we had. The zipper on the Circus Tent was broken, so it was always half shut--it wouldn't open furter or close further. Our tent, a COleman tent was breathable, new, and had a dividing curtain in the middle, much better.   Of course, in Marquis, there's no such thing as a curfew. So we were jamming until midnight, and then the rest of the teenagers disappeared while I was in the bathroom, and left me with the two recruits (they had a curfew, since they're ten). I exhausted all of the card games I have ever known in my life by beating both recruits several times, of course, in their "circus tent", and only escaped when I claimed to be tired and ready to go to bed. In truth, I wasn't tired in the slightest, and would much prefered to be out wandering with Jack, Lindsay, Jenn, Bryan, and Emily. But I disappeared into my tent and re-read The Priestess of Avalon. I got through about 50 pages, when Lindsay and Jenn came back. Of course, i was reading, and listening to music to block out the snores of Jenn's dad, when Emily, Bryan, and Jack returned. I moved my arm and a bag next to me rattled. I hear Bryan (the other bass drum) say "Is that the sound of something delicious?" and i say "What??" and he goes "Oh, I guess not. You would've thought walking 45 minutes in each direction along the road, we would've come across some fast food places." I eventually fell asleep, although only to get up again at 5. I wake up to: "WHAT DO YOU WANT ON YOUR BAGEL?"-mother of someone "I WANT CREAM CHEESE ON HALF AND BUTTER ON THE OTHER!"-child "KATHERINE DOESN'T LIKE BUTTER." -mother "I DO SO!" -presumably katherine "NO YOU DON'T!"-mother "BECKY GETS BUTTER, SO I WANT IT TOO!"-Katherine  And I haven't even gotten into the drumming, or Cell Phone Girl, or the mirror-less camp, or the midget parade, or the outdoor shower...or the game of Jello. We'll save that for another post, this one's long enough. With love, April
