Her girls are off in college, so she doesnt have anyone to hang out and shop with. We're going shopping tuesday and to dinner and then just me and her are going (dad is goin on the tuesday trip) to shoe places and to lunch. :D She is so cool! Now, i now where i got some of my mannerisms that no one else has on my moms side. lol My aunt Holt gave me this cute lil bracelet, and it was really nice to see her. She thought i was 14...that kinda pushed a button, but i smiled and didnt correct her until later when i was asked about my grade in school. We ate hamburgers outside by Kaye's pool and talked. It was very intresting. Kaye is a teacher at MTSU and runs the Alternative school with her husband. We talked all about the differences between the schools systems of mt airy and murfreesboro. Quite a difference! lol We watched the horse race..oh gosh..what's it called...the...Belmont! haha yeah the Belmont! We were all hoping that Smartie Jones would win because if he did then he would get the triple crown! Meaning, he would have won the 3 major races and get like 50 million dollars...well, he had the lead just as the race was ending when Birdstone came outta no where and stole the race!! It was almost like watching a football game!! My dads side of the family is big on horse races, i used to go to them all the time when i was a kid. I hated being asked if i remembered Kaye or Aunt Holt, i said yes, because i did, but when asked about Kaye's husband Mike..i just said "well u know its been like forever!" i had no clue who he was. but omg..for a 46 yr old dude, he didnt look half bad! haha hes all built and hes a "sports physiciatrist" or something like that. lol it sounded so funny but its kinda cool. Hes also a teacher and he teaches a number of things at the alt. school as well as karate. Hes really cool. I was glad to find my "2nd half" again. I hope everything else goes well also. *much love*
