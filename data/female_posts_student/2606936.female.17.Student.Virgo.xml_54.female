Basically, it's some conservative in Cali bitching about how liberals are trying to take over the world by persuading people. Or something.  But since it's annoying to have people write negative shit on ur blog, i'll do it all here....   "Like most Americans I was stunned. It was a body blow," said Rumsfeld, who has been fending off calls for his resignation over a crisis threatening President Bush's bid for a second term in November elections.  Some analysts say they are even wondering whether the photographs of prisoners being abused will have the same effect as television pictures of the Vietnam War which eventually turned many Americans against it."   Apparently this is liberal bias because it might persuade someone not to agree with the war, and because the more gruesome pictures of what THEY did to US aren't shown, people don't get persuaded by them, or something.  1) Uhh, obviously there are standards? The fact that "tha Ay-rabs" may have committed worse things, that violate censors' standards for putting pictures in the public domain? (even though we easily get them online anyway.)  2) You see, apparently we are all SO mindless that seeing pictures of torture, next to explanations of how it wasn't the whole army, will make those of us who love and admire Bushie-wushie STOP loving him. Since, ya know, we don't think for ourselves or anything.   Come on... people who actually LIKE bush are soooo in love with him that they simply scream "propaganda!" and ignore it. People who a) don't care or b) hate the man, just get more evidence on why he sucketh.  3) "Well, ok, somaybewemighthavedoneabadthing  BUT we're NOT AS BAD as  THEM!"   is getting to be a very annoying mantra. Dude, we  know  they do bad stuff too.   But come on..... aren't the conservatives the ones who are anti-abortion? ya know, "it's your choice! don't have sex bc someone tells you to! if everyone jumped off a bridge, would you?"   so what's up with this sudden "but MO-OM, everyone ELSE'S government lets them break the geneva conventions! it's not fair!"  4) God.... the fact that someone actually sits around and infers "bias" from news articles so he can bash liberals. Man. We worry about hatred from stuff like racism, sexism, religion..... and right here at home, we have people like this. People who can't even see around the politically-rigid glasses they've built themselves into, who hate people who disagree with them so much that they build websites about it.   The sun is setting....  5)Whoever wrote the article this guy spoke to, used an unclear pronoun reference that makes my head hurt. So basically, you both annoy me.  Uhh, have a nice day.   (And by that, of course, I must mean "kill a Republican.")
