I am sitting here watching the little clock in the corner switch numbers- ever so slowly- until 5:30, when I can leave.  Fridays are so incredibly dull.  No one is here, and no one cares about anything whether they're here or not.  My sole consolation is my access to the internet- God bless email (and Katie, for keeping me amused)!!!  I have looked up prices for cars, checked my account balances, read about what happened on this date in history (nothing that exciting), and worked out my fingers by typing infinite emails to my mom.  If only there were a fire, or some other entertaining catastrophe.  I suppose I could flood the bathroom, but then my soggy shoes would undoubtedly give me away.  Oh, cruel fate!  Why must I have the attention span of a newt?!    I guess I'll just keep myself occupied with random stuff I find online.   urlLink The Dumb Network  is a good place to start.  I wonder how much money one makes by coming up with creative (and stupid) bumper stickers... Perhaps a career change is in order!    On that note, I will write more later.
