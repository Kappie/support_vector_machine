I'm so excited tomorrow's Friday. I have nothing planned all weekend. ALLLL WEEKEND!!! This is beyond exciting. This is my first completely free weekend to myself since marching started, so...basically since summer. What shall I do with it?? Heaven only knows, but whatever it is, it wont require a lot of energy and work. It'll probably be sleeping quite a bit.   I actually practiced today too. At my own free will. I actually brought my instrument home, warmed up, and practiced. It was surprising; Now, if only I could get myself to do that every day, I might actually get good at trumpet. I really need to learn to read music correctly. That miiiight help.   I think for next week, I need to find a focus like Peter...except, he didn't really find a focus yet but it's ok. I'm taking his idea anyway. It's a good one. Maybe it'll help me not notice the bad so much. I'll be more optimistic. Maybe that should be my focus. I don't know. I don't have to figure it out until Sunday night anyway.   I think I'll try to get offline by 9:30. That seems realistic, right? I can do it. I'll just say bye realllly fast to people so they don't have a chance to say anything that reminds me of something or...whatever. I'll just say bye fast. It'll work...really...
