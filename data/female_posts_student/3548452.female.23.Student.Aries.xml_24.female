There's only been two- Karri is one and Shimron is the other- I'm sure he knows this by now. I wished that I could let it go, but until something worth my time comes along, I content myself with my feelings for him at least. Karri? I've met somebody that I could love more and she will never know because yes, I am a chicken shit, and no, I dont want to ruin our friendship by saying how I feel... It's happened too many times with other people. Like Jay, for example. Once I let it fly that I loved him, I might as well have said, "try to make me your slave" for all the good it did me. Apparently he feels that I should say how high when he says jump. Obviously that HASNT worked for him... nor has trying to convince me that he's the best sex I've ever had in my life :| (yeah, right). I'm sitting at home watching "I Love the 90's" anyway, and it's 1994 and all this stuff is just bringing the past to light for me... I was turning 14 and he was turning 16 (we have the same birthday- how he ever thinks I could forget is beyond me) and we met as friends. Like Jay used to tell me about he and I though, it was sympatico(?), or meant to be. Both middle children, both the kind of ignored children, the good children... Just not happy with life as we knew it at that point. Except, I was suicidal, and he kept everything in and gave himself ulcers. Writing was my outlet, I was his outlet (at the time). I dont know when I fell in love, but I fell hard, and I havent been able to get back up... Just when I think I'm ready to, the new guy messes up and he ends up getting compared to him and it's over. I seriously have held a knife to my wrist and watched my mother laugh at me when I was 12... And when I thought about it again and wrote it down, had my dad tell me he'd beat my ass... I'd never seen my dad so mad at me in his entire life as he was at that moment. I dont know if it was desperation that caused me to fall in love- I would say if it happened now yes... but then? It wasnt like now, when sex gets all tied in the way- it was something pure and sacred and there was no way you could call it anything other than what it was. What I felt for jay? I could call that lust because it was all about sex. But how can you say it about someone you've never slept with? I couldnt even do it now because it would ruin this little friendship we spent this long keeping in tact. No matter how long we stay away, we are like best friends and nothing can change that. It takes a whole lot of love to pine after somebody for four years... not really date or see anybody else... and when I did start seeing someone else, here comes Mr. "Let's start over" and that was the end of that. That had to be the worst breakup or whatever u want to call it of my life... I wont go into it 'cause I just may cry today. He is the start of a line of guys who swear I'm so wonderful that any guy would be lucky to have me... two of the four of them are married and he's going to be the 3rd. His wedding is two weeks and three days from now. I'm happy for him, dont get me wrong... I would never do anything to hurt him, but I think I'm starting to see how my dad felt. Till he met my stepmom (or at least, married her) he was miserable in his love life. She loves my dad so much, and it sucks that it took this long for them to be together, but if they had gotten together a long time ago, I wouldnt be here or I wouldnt be me. I can respect that woman because she loves my dad and she tries to be decent to us kids... not always, but she tries. I love her and I can call her mom now- when they got married you've never seen somebody cry so hard... I couldnt even stop myself from crying at the wedding as hard as I tried 'cause I knew I was loosing my dad the way he was with me. Shimron was the person willing to stand up to my dad and tell him that he needed to pay more attention to me and tell him about his daughter. That's when my dad decided he liked him, only after we had broken up. Here we are, years later, and every guy I want to date is compared to him only because he was it for me. We talked about marriage and kids way back then, and now, he tells me I'm too young, and for a long time, he said he wasnt getting married. Now he's the one getting married, and I'm the one saying I never will. Not that I plan to wait for him or anything- I just hold guys to that standard because it's not very often that a girl like me gets love letters, shown daily that she's loved, treated like she's the only thing that matters to someone in this world. I wont give in for anything less. There is a song that kinda depicts how I feel right now though... "Congratulations" by Vesta Williams. That song ran through my head so many times last night, I thought I would just die. Here's the lyrics:  Saw an old friend on the street, she said today's your wedding, My heart stopped, the tears dropped, Saw my whole life pass me by, I had to see you baby, I never ran so fast before, I rushed inside the chapel door, you were waiting all alone, You turned around and heard me call Congratulations, I thought it would have been me Standing there with you Congratulations, I hope you're happy 'cause as long as I can breathe, you'll always be the one for me Why was I the last to know, I thought that we were special, My soul shakes, my heart breaks, As I turn and walk away, I cant believe its over We really never said goodbye thought we'd give it one more try felt our love was here to stay, and now today's your wedding day Congratulations, I thought it would have been me, Standing here with you Congratulations I hope you're happy, 'cause as long as I can breathe you'll always be the one for me...
