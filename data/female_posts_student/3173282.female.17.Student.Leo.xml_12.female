I was cryin....Ryan can't leave!Stupid kids and thier pre-marital sex. Havin babies and whatnot. Ahhhh! Hmm tomorrow is friday for me and many others, because friday is "fitness day" at our school and u have to pay $20 to be part of it. So we're just gonna sleep in and partyyyyy instead. Sounds good 2 me. Have fun if you're one of the people playing ultimate frisbee or DDR. Good luck UWL!! Well i'm tired so it's sleepy time good night girls and boys.
