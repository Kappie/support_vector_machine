I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Cuz I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing   I dare you to forget   those marks you left  across my neck from those nights when we were both  found at our best I could make this obvious,  and you, you could deny me all in one breath you could shrug me off  your shoulders...   I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Cuz I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Hey, lush, have fun It's the weekend Hey, lush, have fun  Hey, lush, have fun It's the weekend Hey, lush, have fun  I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing   Just forget me it's that simple Just forget me it's that simple   -"  Your Own Disaster  "-Taking Back Sunday
