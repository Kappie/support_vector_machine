Number 1: I must really be in the blue, or else just not inquisitive enough...Am I the only person who did NOT know about Katie Murph's performance thingy...I think I might be...  Number 2: I got my Playstation 2 back (from a repair shop in Texas), and I think I'm becoming addicted to video games. I was on that thing at one time for 5 hours! Is that addiction, or is it addiction? My mom is spazzing cause she's been online more that I have! (And trust me, the world is changing if that's happening)  Number 3: I feel sooo left behind! I haven't been online for a few days, and look at all that I've missed! There's been stuff going on that I still have no idea about and....GRRR! It's not fair!!! I wanna know what is going on!!!  Number 4: Actually, this isn't much of an issue, but I was just wondering...How did everyone's graduation pictures turn out? Cause mine turned out AWESOME!! LOL!! I love my pictures, and the money was well spent! ^_^  Number 5: I am also renewing my membership to the I Hate Clarke Club. He didn't say anything to me, its just because everyone else is in it, so I figured that there must be a reason why it has resurfaced. So, like I said, I'm renewing my membership!  Number 6: I am craving a sandwich! Just a plain turkey and cheese sandwich...  Number 7: We have no cheese in the house! None whatsoever! I think that is horribly wrong, and should be fixed. So tomorrow (or whenever I can pull myself away from my Playstation 2) I will venture out to Fishers (yay!) and get myself some cheese!  Number 8: I saw the cutest pair of shoes at the mall! I forget the name of the store, but the shoes were soooo cute!! They were like thong-style flip-flops, but they had a heel!! A HEEL!! Like, an inch-high heel!! I was totally freaking out in the store and hyperventilating because I am addicted to heels! They were SOOO cute, but my mom said, "No, you're not getting them. They're not practical enough to wear everyday." Then we got into a mini-argument over whether we would choose practical or stylish, and I (of course) chose stylish! Who cares if they make your feet hurt? Soak your feet later! So anyways...I'm still stuck without the shoes and I don't think I'll be getting them any time soon, either. Bummer.  Um...I think that's it for tonight. After I get done talking to Joy, I'm gonna sign off and feed my addiction to my Playstation 2. Till then all, Love and Madness!
