Side A.   Bruce Springsteen   "Tenth Avenue Freezeout"    For some reason, the Boss is an easy target of insultsslung by ignorant indie brats that think they are "too cool" for the Boss. The truth being, the Boss is too cool for them. If you've yet to experience  The Ghost of Tom Joad , it is time to go to Borders, or wherever you buy your music, and purchase this magnificant album right away. Now, "Tenth Avenue Freezeout" is a standout track from  Born to Run , another essential Boss CD. This song is constantly stuck in my head, mainly the part when Bruce sings about being all alone.
