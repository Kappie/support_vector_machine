Yes yes, I was up really late, I slept til lordy knows when (most of the day) so it took a while to get to sleep. It's weird...the past three days when I've decided to go to bed, every clock I seem to look at reads 11:10, one minute away from the almighty 11:11. Altho I never wait around for it. I'm drugged all.   O well...I have to go at the minute but I'll think this out a bit and tell you as soon as possible when it would be a good time, practically anytime really.
