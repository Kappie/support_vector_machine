This happened about 4 weeks ago and I still have not seen the $100 bucks yet my brother needs over $800 bucks and my parents handed it over to him without a blink without anything!  He claims he'll be pay it back but forgod sakes this is JOHN!  He owes everyone money!  They didn't give him the whole $800 - more like $300ish for all I know.  But I don't see how this is fair to me?! I want to say something to them but I don't want to sound like a bitch either.   John had plenty of times to save money - Hell he got over 80 bucks for x-mas and he spent it on a fucking golf bag and he can't even afford to fucking golf!  I haven't even spent my money because I'm saving it, just incase something comes up because I know I won't be able to borrow any.  AHHH!! It's not fair!! I almost think I'm the only one that seems to think this is wrong?!
