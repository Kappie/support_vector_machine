Me didn’t go to college…officially that is…went over at 2. by right I had PW, Geo, Lit  Mass pe. But I didn’t go for a single one. Oh well…who cares? Me? Nah….then as usual, painted the banner….i guess you are sick reading bout the banner…I am sick painting it too..this is the bigger banner. 2nd one. It covers the back bart of the hall….sooo big leh…    Tuesday….  Normal day….except that it seemed like Monday. Man I hate it when it seems like Monday all week. Mon and tues are the days where I have the longest days…yuck. And the Pw on both days just pisses me off…its like I have to have a meeting no matter what. And on tues, we had a collaboration. My group got this comment.. “they are simply lost!” oh yea…easy for you to say. The lady with the farnie voice…in charge of Pw, and two others were observing us. Helloo????? How am I supposed to conduct a meeting with three members and three teacher staring at me?? Goodness…and the minute I stop, the pens stop moving!!! Its intimidating larrr….my secretary writes EVERYTHING down. It aint a bad thing. aint a good thing either. Wont go into that. Then, that day, I left college at 10. finished some part of the banner.    Wednesday  Another day as a pjc mugger…all I can do is struggle. My grades for mid year released today. Its really easy to remember. FOC.    A friend and I had this conversation.    HEYY!!! so how your results???  Oh..me? I got an F for Econs….  Gosh! And??  C for MT lit….  Ohhh…  That…I got got Geog. O.    And she just burst out laughing. Turns out she flunked her exams too. Hers is FOO. Sheesh! I got mad that she laughed @ my results… but then, at least I made someone laugh. : ) shdnt take such things seriously I s’pose.  Accidentally poured thinner on my hands…about half a 1 litre bottle. My hands just got burnt. Terrible pain I tell you. And I got sensitve skin summore….left relatively early….9. took bus with vin  reached home. Didn’t eat the whole day. Forgot cash.      Thurs….thats today…  Left early….didnt paint at all. Had A math today…me fed vin and ash chicken rice. They were more than happy to eat…I felt happy too. Me forgot cash today also. Must draw out tmrw. Talked to someone today. Turns out someone owns a blog too…will go see later… Will blog more tmrw…if I have time that is….very tired.    Nites…
