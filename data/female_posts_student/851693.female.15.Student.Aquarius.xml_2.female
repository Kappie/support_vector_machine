I think the rehearsals are going fine, but it's the technical stuff we need to get done.    We definitely need to make a clear stand on what the heck we need to do for exhibition. I am still fairly clueless. I know it's about Western and Eastern culture, but what we put up there, and how we do it is still confusing.        I think we can follow Wenqi's idea of a trail, with one side Eastern and the other Western. Left and Right. East and West. Compare and Contrast. Something like a museum but definitely with more space for stuff.        As for experiences, it is rather exciting to do a class play, especially after R and CHV. It's different because like what many people pointed out, we are doing this pretty much on our own. Although it might get a little exasperating when we are short of time, I'm sure when the show is over, we will be hugging each other and hopping and crying like maniacs. :)        Working with the class so far has been pretty good. I haven't gone berserk or started screaming at anybody, so I must say it has been really excellent.        Pictures! We must take pictures! And make a pretty scrapbook! It could be our class's heirloom!        Sorry if my points are not very connected.
