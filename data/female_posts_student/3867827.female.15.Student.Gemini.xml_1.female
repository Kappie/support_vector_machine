Well I've always prefered to hang with guys because of this. However, the annoying reality is that guys can be just as cattish. Please tell every guy on the face of the earth that if they stare at me they just might get their nose punched in. I'm so sick of guys liking me. Wait that sounded wrong. I like guys as friends but not as people who have crushes on me. And please, if I talk about my friends can't they just smile and nod. How is it any different than me talking about them? But I guess guys will be guys and ranting won't change them, although I wish it would.
