And I haven't been on here in agessss cause all my friends are on LiveJournal so it seemed kinda fruitless to just keep typing away with no one ever noticing or caring. So I got myself my very own lj. I do like the new format stuff here though. Muuuch better than it was when I last posted here. There is a lot to write about so I don't think that I will bother. If ya want to know anything,  urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/_just_give_up_/  and all my new stuff is Friends Only so add me and I'll add ya back.      Thats me, apparently looking like I am thirteen. Ah well.     I can't really remember what pic this is, but none the less its one that I took of myself with the ole digital cam.     Me!  Well thats all cause the troll that is my sibling requires on here immediately. Blah. -
