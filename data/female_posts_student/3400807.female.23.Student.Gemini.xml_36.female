So, I got to go see the kitties tonight. They got spayed today so in order to see them, I had to promise to be   very   calm and   very   quiet... Not that it was terribly difficult, mind you. They didn't feel much like playing, so it's not exactly like I'd want to rough them up.  

I had a dream earlier in the week that Reilly died in the operation to get her fixed, and the most horrible part was that my only response was, "Oh well. I guess we'll take Maddie home instead."  (Maddie is another litter-mate.)  So I've had periodic freak-outs this week as Gwynnie inched closer and closer to the mandatory 2 pounds (at which, incidentally, she just   barely   squeaked under the wire as of this morning!) and I worried that Reilly for some unknown reason wouldn't be ok. So of course I pestered the woman who's fostering them as soon as decently possible this afternoon to make sure they were ok. She said they were fine, and that I could come over this evening.  

So we went on over, and there was this heart-stopping moment when I walked in and saw Reilly lying bonelessly at the front of the cage, so, so, so still. I couldn't see her breathing at all. I gingerly opened the door (fending off other inquisitive kittens, which is why the cage was closed in the first place) and reached out to pet her. I nearly had a heart   attack   when she moved just before I actually touched her... because at that point, I was convinced she was dead. She wasn't, of course, just very, very zonked out from the anesthesia. Gwynnie was doing much better. She wasn't up and walking around like (ironically enough) Maddie who seemed to have come through it more quickly than the rest, but she was more alert. She started purring as soon as I touched her. That's a sound to make a mommy's heart feel all warm and fuzzy! So we cuddled them (according to Anthony) for 45 minutes or so (I'm not sure, it certainly didn't seem that long!) and then had to go. Because, really, staying over at someone else's house for hours on end is not exactly proper etiquette.  

As we were leaving, I couldn't help but laugh at the thought that those 45 minutes are probably the longest Gwynnie has ever held still without being asleep. She's such a feisty one! :) Oh, I just can't wait. Less than 48 hours now and my babies will be home with me. Oooh! :)
