All i have to say is this:  Thank you for your insight into the situation of the death of my grandfather and the meanings of my feelings.  Also I would like to thank you further for FINALLY writing about le anne (and yes i know i spelled her name wrong).  You needed to do it for a long time, and she needs to realize that you still do have strong feelings for her, that you still love her, and that if she would just FUCKING STOP FLIRTING WITH A THOUSAND GUYS that you wouldn't feel so insecure, argue, and FINALLY be able to treat her the way you want to.  I would like to firther state that  ROSIE a.k.a. Tao-Tao is in fact a bitch, and that if she had not FUCKED with both of your minds you probably would still be together right now, maybe even had reached the graveyard, perhapes? (Yes, I know they both read our blogs; that's why I write this without fear.)
