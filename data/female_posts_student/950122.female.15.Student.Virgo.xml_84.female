We watched the first six-eight episodes of Sailor Moon (Live Action Drama Series), and we just soo got into the parts. Now I'm Sailor Jupiter. XD We went to Tomas Morato afterwards; it's this trippy food strip and ate at Teriyaki Boy. We got to ride in their new car!! It's a Chevrolet!! Cooool. Teriyaki Boy was this cool Japanese Restaurant with a call button for the waiters. They were also playing japanese songs. After eating, we saw one of the players of the Ateneo basketball team. We was like, 6'3 or something! Geez!  We went back to Camilla's house after that. We watched more SM LADS. :)) Gela and Karina went home soon after, and we went to sleep. This morning tho we watched like, 6 episodes of .hack//SIGN. Wahaha. I went home at 12 noon. Fuuuun. :D  Oh yeah. I can go to forums again!! And I can see my tag-board! Happpoooy! ;P
