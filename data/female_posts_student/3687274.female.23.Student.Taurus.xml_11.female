Things that I would normally do at a job, but in conjunction with a shit load of other stuff.  Well, I do answer phones.  I actually hate that part of the job.  Between 4 and 7 that damn thing never stops.  Today was horrible though, I took one hit off my cigarette before it burned out because so many fucking people were calling.  I s'pose that's what I'm here for.  But some days I don't want to be.  I think I might just move to Nevada and whore.  (I wonder if Mike has read this recently.) Just kidding.  Not that I think it's wrong, I just don't think it's right for me.   I have decided to find a sugar daddy, but not an old one.  But not a young one.  Middle aged would be good.  He has to be tall at least 5'10, I have an issue with height.  He can't be skinny.  I don't like skinny people, as a matter of fact I hate them!!!  I just want to kidnap them and force feed them cheddarwursts and macaroni and cheese.  (I wonder if she knows I'm talking about her...)  But that would be cruel.  Sorry.   I don't want a sugar daddy anymore.   There's this cute guy that works at the building that I protect.  There's always a cute guy in my life.  One that I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever speak to.  Because I'm retarded.  I have this thing...Sometimes I don't care what people think of me, especially guys.  It's that whole "share my life take me for what I am, cause I'll never change all my colors for you...", but then when there is a guy I'm interested in I just assume that they have absolutely no interest in me whatsoever, so I don't bother trying.  I don't bother holding conversations, I don't laugh when they do things that I think they think are funny, even if they are funny cause I just assume that didn't do them to make me laugh.  I think that's sad.  Oh well!!!  I don't like dating anyway.  And I don't like sex either.  That's funny.   I have nothing more to say.
