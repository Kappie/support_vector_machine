Would some kind soul tell me what books are on the reading list for tenth grade?  I seem to have misplaced my sheet.  Well, DC was fuuun.  =)  My favorite part: Holocaust Memorial Museum!  Man, that thing was so freaking awesome.  And there was a special exhibition called "Deadly Medicine"... so cool.  I love driving on the fourth of July.  There are NO CARS on the highways.  It took us almost 24 hours to drive to DC on a non-fourth day, and it only took us 21 hours to drive back!  How awesome is that?  Plus, we got to watch fireworks on the drive back!  =DDD  Now, I will go catch up on a 5-week break from Internet and all things holy (which would be Internet).
