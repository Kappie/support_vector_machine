Nobody showed up...well, those that typically occupy the library at this time, and I'll be damned if I'm going back to Rau for the next 55 minutes.  The Biology gateway practice was a joke. If I don't get a hundred I'm going to bleed myself for slacking.   Umm, I had something else to say but I forgot. Heh. Suprise. Time to go back and do some Euro I guess.  What a boring SOB I've become. Augh.
