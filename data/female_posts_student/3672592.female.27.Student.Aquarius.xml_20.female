The people living here are living in homes made out of packing flats and cardboard. When there is a fire it will take out several blocks of homes in just a few short hours. Building these homes for these families indescribable. The homes we are building are beingmade out of cinder blocks. The people living in Tierro Nuevo are people coming up from southern part of Mexico for jobs in the factories. Most of these families dayly wages hardly cover the taxes for the land they live on, so finding money to pay for house to built is out of the question.  Pictures
