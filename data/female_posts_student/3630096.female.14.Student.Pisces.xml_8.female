Head to school, everything went on quite OK. Except during english, I spent 1 1/2 hour trying to complete 10 points of 100 words summary. It was such a difficult task. Gee. I had to say thank you to Janice, she helped me to hand it in. hehe. Then no PE again, which is such a waste. It's been two weeks! I haven't run for two whole weeks! Sigh. Time indeed is passing very fast like seconds...    Following next after geography, which was being held by one teacher and one investigator, was recess. Finally, I could stretch my limbs and walk about, only that...I couldn't. After recess was maths, which was very challenging and just as enjoyable as usual (only that miss chan wasn't here, it was such a disappointment for the boys! ha). Right after that was science which was slightly more fun than usual...   Then was band. I somehow did not feel like going. I feel like skipping band practice, which was something unsual. Band was something that uplifted my spirits at the end of the day. Almost everyone skipped today, novan and kian yong. Those were ones of the best players in band. The trombone section would not survive when kian yong was not there and the same goes to the french horn section. It was such a discouraging band practice. Reprimanded by Mr Ong because I don't know the rhythm. It's my first time ever reprimanded and insulted directly! :'(! Hello, who would not feel nervous!? It was my worst day ever for the week... And everything won't go any better for tomorrow...    I just wished, tomorrow would be all right.
