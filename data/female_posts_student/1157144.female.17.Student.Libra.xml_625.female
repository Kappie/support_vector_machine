I was thinking that one beach in Santa Cruz next to the boardwalk...the name of it starts with an S, but I don't remember what it's called, so yeah. But we can go to another one if we want. We could even hit up a beach in SF ((if anyone knows of one)), but yeah. So yes,  I am for the beach on Saturday.
