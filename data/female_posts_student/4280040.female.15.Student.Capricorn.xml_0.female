I'm not ready for all the homework, and all that crap though. This year is really going to be difficult, with more classes, and the Ohio Graduation Tests coming up. Erg. I don't have any classes with Kayla or Alana this year, except for lunch, like usual. It sucks, cause I hardly have any friends at Shawnee. Perhaps I can make some new ones...hopefully. I can make friends pretty easily. But yes...I just pray that I can get through this school year ok.      The Purpose Driven Life  is seriously an awesome book. I just got done reading chapter 25, which was titled "Transformed by Trouble"...and wow, it just touched me so much. The whole chapter was pretty much talking about how God has a purpose behind every problem, and every struggle that we face. I'm kind of thinking about doing a lesson on this at prayer sometime. I think it'll be a good lesson topic. I'm gonna post a few quotes and verses that were in this lesson....just to make you all think a little bit. And all of this is true. All the crap that goes on in our lives has purpose...and they will all help us grow closer to God. I have experienced it already. Like when my sister moved out, I feel like I have gotten closer with God, and I feel like I have matured more. God will use every problem we face and do something significant with it.       "You'll never know that God is all you need until God is all you've got."      "Everything that happens to you has spiritual significance."      "What happens outwardly in your life is not as important as what happens inside you."     Romans 8:28-29:  "We know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. For God knew his people in advanced, and he chose them to become like his Son."
