Subhana allathi Yusabihu al ra'du bi hamdihi wal malaikatu min kheefatihi         Glory be to the one whom the thunder celebrates His praise, and the angels (too) for fear of Him   Its been a hard day, I wish life didnt have to be complicated, and that we didnt have to make hard decisions.      Hasbiya allahu wa ni'mal-wakeel        Allah is sufficient for me and is the best one to put trust in.  Fi amani allah wasalam.
