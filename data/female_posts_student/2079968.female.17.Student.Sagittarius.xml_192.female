Maybe I'll make some fritters later on...mmm...  I don't know, I'm just in the mood to cook.  So, I never wrote about yesterday. I went up to the store Daniel's family owns, because his mom wanted to take pictures to send to Daniel. Laura and her sister Emily had nothing better to do, so they came and picked me up. I should probably explain that Daniel's in the army, hehe. When I got there, my friend Craig gave me such a big hug, I thought I was going to die. I couldn't quite breathe. But it's always fun to go in there...  Craig snapped a few shots of me looking stupid, then Daniel's mom came 'round the store to show off hilarious pictures of the guys sporting fake mustaches and other various cheap goods they'd ordered from some catalogue. Also, there were a few shots of gummy bears playing football, just something you need to see at least once before you die. Ah, such greatness.  Craig then thought it would be a good idea to raid Daniel's room...so he asks for permission to get off work for a second and we walk down to the house...Laura and Emily decide to run up to the theatre. When we got to the house, Craig and I ran up to Daniel's room to reminisce a little and look through his stuff. See, it wasn't really RAIDING! It was...kind of nice...but at the same time sad...  I should probably put up that picture of that sign Laura, Emily, and I saw...I won't describe it...it's just something you must see.
