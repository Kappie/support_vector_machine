We've been talking a little bit since we got home and it turns out he has to get some tests done b/c he had a heat stroke and it might have affected his brain. I'm pretty sure I got the story right, and so I'm worried about him. Hes a really great guy, and he doesn't mind when I talk about  kevin  nonstop. He asked me to pray for him, and even though I'm not religous at all, I'm going to, so if ya'll could to, that would mean a lot to me.    Rick, your not broken, I promise! I'll fix it all. I dunno how, but i'll come up with something, and you know I'm always here for you. Feel better!
