We didn't do anything, hmm, well I combed his hair and gave him a kiss on his cheek, and he gave me a kiss on my cheek too. We had a pillow fight too!!! It was the greatest. He kept looking at me while we were "sleeping" and getting my hands out of my face, and he would hesitate on whether to hold them or not, and I finally asked why he was scared to hold my hand, so he did...awe. So that's how our cuddling got started. Anyway, we left to Sam's and we saw Justin, Robert, Rob, and Jeff play. They did good... there was lots of people there from school. Anyway, I had fun with Alek and Jeanette. We held hands on our way home....
