At night, stopped by Nick's then saw "the notebook" and now I'm home... "Stop worrying about what I want or what he wants or what your parents want. What do you want?"-the notebook "Well that's what we do, we fight. You tell me when I am being an arrogant son of a bitch and I tell you when you are a pain in the ass. We fight, it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to work at it every single day but I'm willing to do that because I'm crazy for you"-the notebook rL02 (1:10:56 AM): i know what u mean... but after time it hurt less. but it still hurts to this day when i think about her rL02 (1:20:59 AM): it wasnt a game, people fall out of love...it hurts...but it happens. rL02 (1:25:55 AM): look at all these ppl that get divorced, at one point in time they were in love w/ each other,im not saying it does anything.. but it still was love rL02 (1:29:19 AM): love is different for every relationship..some ppl, its forever...
