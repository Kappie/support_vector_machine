I really like the stuff though.  It's interesting and FOR ONCE I KNOW something in social - I LEARNED something.  I went to go work out again today for like two hours.  When I stand on my toes you can literally see how muscular my legs have become.  I was 138 this morning and then in the evening I was 140.  However, right now I am not too concerended with the weight.  I mean I drank three bottles of water today and did the full circuit of weights.  I think maybe I am reducing some of the fat in my body and just building more muscle cause I really don't see a big change in the way I look.  I feel so great.  I feel so happy.  On the treadmill I just ran for half and hour stright and just thought about all the stupid bad things that occurred of have happened.  My Goodness that is such a good way to release anger.  I love going to the YMCA.  I am addicted!  Last night Ali and went for a swim after our workout too.  That felt so good.  I also made these energy granola bar things tonight.  It was in the paper like last month and was created by a dietician who won some contest thing.  It is soooo good, and really healthy.  Man I wish all food could be like that.  LoL!!
