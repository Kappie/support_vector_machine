But I realized as I kept hearing more and more that it wasn't really the notes that got to me, it was what the notes represented in my head. Each note held a picture, held a feeling, an emotion that never seemed to make me smile but only to make me hurt. And then I found out it wasn't that either. I'm just missing you. Things will never be like they used to be but you can't stop water from flowing anymore than time. Even if you turn off the clock, it still goes on and I guess life does too. I was in the car with my parents one time, driving down the highway, when my father started driving a little too recklessly. We almost sideswiped a car and almost rear-ended another going 80 MpH. And I remember closing my eyes because I didn't want to see the windshield crack and the glass fly everywhere. I remember focusing on the music playing in the background because I didn't want to hear metal crunching. Because I wasn't ready to die. A few years later I'm in the same position and as I close my eyes, I smile. Because inwardly, I am ready to die. My business is not finished, My life isn't complete, but I was happy. That moment I was happy, I was smiling, I was happy. I wouldn't have minded dieing at that moment. But I didn't. I'm still here, still writing down all my thoughts and feelings. I have a feeling I'm still going to be here for a very long time, like an old soul that never fades. You told me that you were going to miss me somuch and it just made me laugh. Time heals all wounds, you'll only miss me for a little while. So I told you that I would be here when you got back. And even though you said you knew that, I had a feeling that you were waiting for me to say it. Nothing is certain in this world and I won't make any promises to you because I know this. Things change, nothing is ever the same. Though you may not feel it, I do. Things aren't the same between us. Everything has changed and as much as I don't want to admit it, it has. A long time ago I wanted so badly to tell you to never leave me, to always hold me the way you were doing, and to love me. But I didn't say anything. Because I knew that one day everything would be different and I didn't want to hurt you. I still don't. Because I love you. But sometimes love changes. Time heals all wounds but it can cause some. I think it's definitely done some damage in our case. But then again, it may be that it's just me. I don't want to let you go but I don't want to hang on. What would you say if I told you this? How would you react? I'm not saying I want to end it. But I'm growing up, I always have been. And as I grow up, are you willing to grow with me and take this to the next level? I think I could definitely enjoy this if we'd just...do...more things together. Take a walk, go shopping, see a movie, just be with each other instead of trying to find someplace to be alone so we can kiss and makeout. But if that's all you want to do, if that's all this is for you, an outlet for passions you need to express......It would hurt me and I would hate myself more than anything. Because I would have to say goodbye. I would have to kiss you and tell you that our story has ended because I couldn't do it. I should probably be telling you this instead of airing it to internet. I only have four more days until you go off and leave the place that always rains. I think I don't say anything because I'm afraid of what you would say. You've always told me the truth and how you felt. I know you wouldn't lie to me no matter what the consequences...Would you be so willing to say goodbye? Or would you be willing to go deeper into what we've become and get past the hormonal urges of adolescence and BE with me? I'm older than I am and if I'm going to be in a relationship, I'm going to be in a committed and meaningful relationship. I'm not one to jump from boyfriend to boyfriend because I want something more. Do you? Or am I going to have to let you go too? Thinking like this makes me heartsick and angry and hurt and frustrated...But know this..I'm old enough to make sacrifices and if I have to sacrifice what I feel when I'm around you for the sake of finally standing up for what I want.........I reluctantly will.
