When I got off work I met Jessica at Wal-Mart so we could go  "job-hunting"  together. We went to all the lil' shops in Easley then we went to Powdersville where we saw a miracle: "Help Wanted". Well little did we know that we would have to drive  across the state  to get a piece of scrap paper... i mean, an  application . Anyway... it was fun, and I did learn my way around Greenville from the expirence... hmmmm. We also paid a surprise visit to Nikol!!!!   Highlight of the day: I got an early application to USC .. yeaaaa!  Disappointment of the day: The job was for full-time.. grrr
