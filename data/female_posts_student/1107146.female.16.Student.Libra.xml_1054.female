I'm just looking for one that's not a total show-off, one that would contribute to  the band  rather than  one's self ...si vous comprenez...new rule, no foreign languages, n'est-ce pas? Heh. But yeah, it would also help if I knew this person. The fabric of sucessful bands lie in their friendship rather than their will to jam. Most of those bands expire in a year or so; though we haven't had that test of time up to now, I'm betting we'll last for a long while. We haven't become sick of each other yet: moreover, we're sick of our NHS oppressors making us chop our song to little bits.   But after the talent show, I'd be willing to try anything. I'll come and check them out next week, if that would be ok (I was at Alex's all weekend).  Have fun with your weekend all, I have to start practicing :(
