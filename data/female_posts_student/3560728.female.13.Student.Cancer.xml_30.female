That would make everything so much better cuz I could just be like, "Fuck you. I'm too good for you anyways." But honestly, I don't deserve him because I'm such a jaded retard. I hope he goes off with his little friend Agnes (not her real name, it's just a shitty name, so she deserves it) cuz she's so much easier to understand and she's so fucking obvious in the way she feels about him. I'm emotionless. Emotions lead to pain, embarrassment, etc. But to Him, I'm sorry for being such a cold hard bitch. I tried not to be, but it didn't work. God, I hate him for so many reasons. I hate him for making me believe that every little moment meant something, and that he actually liked me in that way, although maybe I imagined it all. I hate him for disappearing, and leaving me hanging. I hate him because he's probably forgotten about everything...and I hate him for making me  feel all this shit, but what can I do??? Absolutely nothing...except for listening to The Spill Canvas, and sulking. I'm such a loser.
