I had many a plans to go to a Jet concert, (even though their music is now overplayed and mildly annoying, a concerts a concert!), but it got canceled! Arg! How bad's that! I am sooo pissed! It would have been great! Oh well, i spose now I'll just get a cool top with the money...but still!  Anyway, enough with the whinging! Nothing much has happened latly (surprise surprise!) But I am contemplating going to Space School. It's in the holidays, so thats a bit of a bum, but I still wouldn't mind going. May as well try, anyway! *looks positive, then rolls eyes at the thought of being positive*  Later.   And, remember, 'Fat Kids Shouldn't Stage Dive.' *nods*
