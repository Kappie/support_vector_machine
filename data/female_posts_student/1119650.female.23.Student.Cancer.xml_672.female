I find this hard to say because I really enjoyed the first one, but this one totally suprassed it and my expectations for it.  I thought it was going to be overhyped like the rest of the summer movies, but Sam Raymi didn't disappoint, plus,  having hot assed Tobey Maguire in a sometimes shredded Spidey suit didn't hurt either.  Do yourself the favor and get your ass out to see it.  Even if you have to sit in a theatre full of ignorant chuckleheads yelling "Awwwwwww sheeeeit son, that kid got knocked out.  That was C r A z Y".
