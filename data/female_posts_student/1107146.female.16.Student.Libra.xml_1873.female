I mean, yeh, I wanted the Cubs to go, but now that that whole saga is over...In the words of the great Cary Grant/ Rhet Butler: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."  Short, sweet and sarcastic.  The story of my life.    Welcome back Will!  My aunt and uncle should be about half-way to China now!!!  YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!!!
