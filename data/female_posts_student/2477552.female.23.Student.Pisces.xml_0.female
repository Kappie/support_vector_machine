And just for good measure I put two wine bottles in my window to help activate my love and relationships corner. lol.  Later tonight my roommates might be going to lady's night at the stripclub. I might just go along. ; ) Some choices are just so hard to make.  Pay $5 and see naked guys  or stay home. Hmm. Oh yeah I'm going. lol.
