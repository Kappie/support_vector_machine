Now, I will gladly explain what that statement has to do with anything. See, this morning, I headed off to the (semi)local beach. Don't get any grand ideas that I live in some fabulous warm sunny spot. No, this beach is on the shores of Lake Erie. That's one of the Great Lakes, for anyone who wondered, or didn't know. Anyway, I'm getting off the subject. I went with a church group. My church group. Sort of. That's a long and complicated story for a different post. This group is filled with friends of mine. I knew two of them would be there for sure, but there was potential for up to 6 of them - these are my closest friends. I knew everybody there, but mostly as acquaintances. Now, I am not an overtly social person, so acquaintances are not my most favorite people. The only people I really knew there were my best friend, whom we'll call Susie, and my friend's little sister, whom we'll call Becky.  Now, Susie has a story all her own, but for now we'll suffice it to say that the title of best friend is mostly a courtesy, remnant, etc... from a different time, especially on my part. Becky had friends who were going, so I was not expecting to talk to her much, but at least some. Besides us three, there were six others.  We spent a meager 3 hours at this beach. Granted beaches are tiring in general. But by the time we left the beach, I felt like I had run a marathon. Obviously I hadn't, having read and slept for half the time, and the other half spent talking. Is it normal to feel so exhausted after speaking to a close friend?? No, of course it isn't. It should make you happier. I often feel tired after a social outing.  I actually have no idea where I'm going with this, and in my half-asleep state, it doesn't really feel like I'm being cohesive, comprehensible. Oh well. It felt good to get it out. I'm going away now. I'll be back soon with details of things no one cares about but me.
