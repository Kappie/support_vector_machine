Well, my alarm went off, and I got up, but then i went back to sleep and didn't get up until 6:00 so me and Amez had to take a shower together w/ bathing suits on, and hurry to get ready. Once we were ready by 7:15, we waited til 8:00 for church to start. This was a lutheran church, so we knew how the service went, but i've never sang a hymn so fast!! The pianist couldnt' have played them faster! And the assistant pastor person reminded me of the guy from Office Space with the stapler, and he had a lisp. And the sermon was 32 minutes long. Amez timed it. -lol- Then we took at picture out in front of the sign thingy, and we were off to SC.  We had a great time in the car though, because we all just talked and gossiped. Stains and Blankets. OCD girlfriends. -lol- Once we got in SC though, and we said hey to our parents and stuff, we prayed in a circle. Me and Jenn started crying. I feel like these people are my family. I really do. And I started missing them as soon as I said I wasn't gonna' cry. And by the way, I hardly ever cry. I miss them, I really do. We all hugged, and then took some pictures, and we left. I cried all the way home, and when I was home, I wouldn't talk to anyone about the trip, and i started putting this journal up. Hopefully someone will read it and think it's cool. If not, it's okay because it's an outlet for me.   I think my Dad thinks i'm mad at him or something, because he kept asking me about the trip, and I kept cyring and wishing I was with everyone. You know how they tell you Mission trips change your life, and you know it's true, but you never believe it? Well I believe it now. I honsetly think this has changed my life. And I think i'm the only person out of the whole trip who would have liked to have not come home. I could honestly do this for a living. I've always wanted to be a pediatric neurologist, but I think I could do stuff with youth groups too. Well I g2g. Night ya'll.  Liz
