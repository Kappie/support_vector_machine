I can get all my feelings out instead of keeping them bottled up inside.  Yes, I write about suicide. However. Just because I write about it in no way indicates that I'm going to follow through. If anything, writing about it prevents me from doing so.  Yes, most of my poems are either sad, morbid, or depressing. I write what I feel and often I  feel  sad, morbid, or depressed.  No, I don't care if you like my stuff. The topics I write about aren't easy for a lot of people to handle.  No, I don't compare my poetry to other peoples'. Everyone has their own styles of writing and mine is unique to me.  No, I'm not going to commit suicide just because I wrote a poem about that. I know I said that already, but it's important for people to know.
