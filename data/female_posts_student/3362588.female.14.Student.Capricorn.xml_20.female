See, yesterday I broke my brand new E string.  It must have had a weak spot, 'cause they AREN"T supposed to break the second time you use em'!!!  So now, I'm counting the seconds until the play.  Sue SAID she's getting me one when she goes to Chico for her appointment, but what if she forgets??  Or what if I ruin the violin since it' the first time I've ever changed a string by myself??? I even lost sleep over it... well actually... I couldn't go to sleep for any number of reasons.  And then I kicked my alarm clock out of my bed (so what I sleep wit my alarm clock??????????) and broke it (I think). Seriously, I think God made my hair out of spounges.  I washed and braided my hair last night so it'd be all cool and crinkly for the play, and it STILL isn't dry this morning.  After sleeping on it ALL night.  Better be dry by tonight.... Oooooo....  Here's a site on changing fiddle strings........  drat, no picts.   Oh man, the computer keeps freezing up.  I hope the power surge yesterday didn't bust it.   Dang... Doesn't anyone tell you how to change a violin string with pictures???????  How a hurdy-gurdy works with pictures... not what I'm looking for...  Signing off - Jack the Still Tired
