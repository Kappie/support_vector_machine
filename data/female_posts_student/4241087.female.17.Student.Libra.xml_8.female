I'm still waiting for that fateful letter from UPJ that tells me whether or not I'm actually going to school there this semester. I mean nothing to serious... Just my FUTURE here! And now I have this car to pay for which means I need a decent job. On top of this I still have two little girls I'm supposed to be mentoring to but haven't had the time to see yet. Not to mention this guy who just kinda appeared in my life. He's something I want to make time for... HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THIS?! I'm just so overwhelmed! Breathe in, breath out... Everything is going to be alright in the end. Bring it on world.  Now, on a completely random whim, my philosophy on love. To be honest I've been giving this "love" stuff a lot of thought lately and I have come to the conclusion that love is not only a feeling... Love is a choice. You don't wake up every morning and feel that you love someone. Feelings change. You wake up every morning and choose to love someone. Even if they make you angry or stress you out, you choose to love them.     Choose to love...
