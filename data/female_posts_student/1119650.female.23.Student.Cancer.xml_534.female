Like me, but as a girl?" - Seth Cohen   Anyhow yesterday I spent one of the best days I have in a while, at the  urlLink Spa  with my bestest girlie, Lisa.  She was treated like some food with a sugar scrub, a milk bath and a shea butter massage so she's nice and smooth and luxurious.  I treated myself to a milk bath and a Desert Stone massage.  Let me tell you, I've had massages before, but with these smooth hot oiled stones gliding over your skin it was nothing short of pure excstasy.  While he was giving me the foot massage, Joe, the masseuse, also almost gave me an orgasm.  My feet are very sensitive on the bottom and whatever he was doing was so incredible and sexual in a non sexual way its getting me excited to write about it now.  He wasn't hot at all, but it was one of the most sexual experiences I have ever had.    We followed up our massages with some makeup shopping at  urlLink Sephora  (like I needed an excuse to go there!!) and some good old fashioned girl talk and yummy chinese lunchies at  urlLink P.F. Chang's China Bistro .  It was great to spend so much time with her, I've missed her and she's been closer location-wise than ever and we just never took advantage of it.  (c:  I have to say, the OC is so fucking good.  Watch it.  Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) is (to borrow a term from the Don) "adoobly" and I want to date him.  (le sigh).    I had an awesome weekend.  Friday night I was very nicely treated to a dinner at  urlLink Eclisse  and then I rocked out with everyone and early Saturday morning in the NEGATIVE TWO degree temperature I headed out with Andrew for some snowboarding.  We went to  urlLink Hunter Mountain  and it was freezing and windy, but it was a great time.  I dropped my board off to get a quick tune up (some fresh wax and sharpen the edges) so I won't be so dead the next time this season we hit the slopes.  Also if anyone has any good exercises for strengthening your upper legs  (BESIDES SQUATS!! I HATE SQUATS)  please drop me an email or a comment.  I finished Monday night up with some kickboxing and I feel so amped about it, becuase I love going in there and just getting all my aggression out.  If I hadn't taken that spill on Saturday and hurt my elbow I would have been able to go full on grudge match mode when we were alternating right  left jabs  hooks.  Oh well, theres always Wednesday.
