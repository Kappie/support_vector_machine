I thought my party would of been just okay since Linda and Vickie are the only ones who could come. Since I learn the night before I got 79.12$ cdn from my mami, I had to pick Vickie up earlier to go to the bank then Vickie and I chilled "chez moi" and then we walked to papineau metro and we waited for Linda when she showed up like 10 minutes late. No biggie then it was instant bonding started then and there. we were laughing and being silly. But laid back. No worries. And as soon as we went into the first clothingf store Linda started to capote ben red when we got to kokawaii. She can look so hot if she has the clothes. She said before we went out that she's fat which is sooo not true. She's a small. I did sort of feel left out not being able to wear string bikinis. But i DIDN'T try one on. But linda has small woes. But I tried on a two piece at bikini village and it looked nice. But 144$ but I found a gorgeous halter tankini bathing suit at the gap for 51$ and I bought a skirt from moto, 2 woe supporters, one for me and one for linda, two flossers for me and one for vickie ( I cant believe she wants to wear them now. My baBY'S are growing up. Linda fits a 34A. I am 36A and vickie's 32A almost B the lucky bEACH. She loosk the best in bikini's but linda has a nice stomache like Vickie. oh well. Then we got on the metro adn had some laughs. Their new nicknames Vickie=Blue Sea and Linda=Pink Limonade. Man Linda looked sooo damn hot in a pink and yellow dress. Grr. Stupid Love Handels. Anyway I got some cool stuff. I was really happy. then we all chilled and then got money to rent videos. And of course linda asks if we can talk my dog for a walk. We ate popiciles while we walked. Not good since Vickie and I were totally messy and then Lucy took a shit and I felt like I was sugar high and weird people were talking to us. And a weird french guy asked if Linda frenched good and said he did.ewww..he was ugly and rude and fat and ew. And then we rented scary movie 3, hot chick in french oops and bring it on. Scary movie 3 is sooo lame and not funny. Hot chick is booring in french and linda couldn't stay long. But it was still fun. It wouldn't of been this fun without out her. Cuz she got all excited and shit. Lol. We should do it again gurls!
