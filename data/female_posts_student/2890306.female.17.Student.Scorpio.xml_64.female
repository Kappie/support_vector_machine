So I'm sitting here in this nicely temperatured room shivering. It's almost funny.    Tonight, I have Honor's Choir practice at Roosevelt. Too bad I don't really know any of the songs yet. Hehe, it's okay. Neither does Weesa. We proved that to each other yesterday when we tried to practice on her piano. Let's just say there were many missed notes and a lot of "doo doo doo"ing going on. Basically Concert Choir practice. Ha, just kidding. Sort of.    So, I did yoga yesterday at the health club. I felt advanced because I knew everything she did. Next time, I plan to attend Intermediate Yoga! It feels good to exercise. You should.    Oh, and if you're looking for some good music, try "The Noose" by A Perfect Circle and "1985" by Bowling For Soup. If you're too cheap to buy a CD, I found a good music downloading thing. It's called Limewire. So, go get ya some good music.    I hope it makes you shivery too.
