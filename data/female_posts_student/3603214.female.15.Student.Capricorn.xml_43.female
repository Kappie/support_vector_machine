"I want to bake a pie out of him...naked...A naked key lime pie." thus the birth of the nkl-p's. so he's gonna b at rehearsal on thursday so i gotta look glam punk lol. he's so purdy...and has a gorgeous smile...and awesome hair. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HAIR! hehe...so yea..i'm still giddy. and key lime pies are a good cover if you're talking to guys *coughbradcough* about how you are now feeling amazing and happy for a change. lol. w/e...since you *coughtasha* have heard this story b4, i'm out.  I HAVE A REASON TO GO TO REHEARSAL! won't you be my friend??
