Mom and Kay convinced me to buy a gorgeous dress for a dance that is months away and I don't even know if I want to go.  The dress is on its hanger, sitting in my closet facing me.  I liked it better when dresses were loose and bright and flowery, and worn ragged.  Instead this is long and black and strapless and very very intimidating.  With every day that passes I want to be an adult less and less, yet every day i look more and more like one.  There was a time when I would have happily given up every one of my possessions to be an adult.  I would listen to my parents' music, borrow my mom's clothes, sit with the adults at parties and essentially do everything i could to be a mini adult.  Yet now that I'm old enough to sit with the grown ups all i want to do is sit at the kids table...Isn't life ironic?
