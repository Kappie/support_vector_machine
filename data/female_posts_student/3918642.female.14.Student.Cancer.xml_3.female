I don't really know what I'm going to say in this blog entry but all I know is that my thoughts are just flowing into my fingers as my fingers are flying over the keyboard typing out my every thought. I don't know if I'll hide anything on this blog because I know that I've hidden some things in my public one. What I need right now is guidance. I really don't know what to do. Read Wilfred's blog and thought about what he had to say about the problem I was currently having. She cleary stated for me to stay out of her life. What do you want me to do about it? Why do I have to say I'm sorry when I don't even know why she's so pissed off at me. Is it because of all the stuff she said in her blog? That I lecture her everytime she talks to me about something? Do I really lecture her? I remember just not saying much about certain things! I don't say much when she tells me stuff because I hated how  she  always ended up lecturing me about everything! I turn to her with my problems with Nima and she ends up giving me this whole talk that I really didn't need. Instead of helping me think things out, that shit she said made things worse! It's always annoyed me how she tried to act all "cute" too, but do you see me snapping at that? I hate how she snaps at me but I let it go every time. You never see me snapping at her! She doesn't even know this but she makes me feel so stupid every time she gives me one of her as-a-matter-of-fact comments. I really don't need that stuff but I just took it all in and kept quiet anyway.  Wil pointed out so many places in my old blog about how much I loved my best friend. Yeah, those were all true. It took a lot of troubles, sweat, tears, and of course laughs to get through to now. It wasn't me who told her to get out of my life... she told me to. It'll probably only frustrate her even more if I did anything about that. So what can I do? I can't force my way back into her face because of that.   Yeah, she's always been there for me. She went all the way downtown with me and all the way back up with me and was there when I was doing stuff with Wil. At the Candy Carnival she went outside and walked with me when I wanted to. Yeah, she was there all those times. But what do you want me to do about it? I can't do shit to get her to take back the "get out of my life". It wasn't me who decided to end this, it was her. And if that's what she wanted then that's that.   I know that she gets frustrated with me. I know that I'm not the greatest friend in the world. I'm not perfect... but the fact is: we've both changed into totally different people. From when we first met in grade 4 till now. Five years ago, we were just friends. She knew me as "the girl who beat up Martin" and I knew her as "the milky pens girl". We sat together sometimes in Malin's french class upstairs and drew with her milky pens. In grade 5, we talked more and became best friends. We talked about Eric, Benny, and other stuff. In grade 6, we were still best friends and she was there too when I was with Ronen. In grade 7 last year, she was there when I was with Mike, when I was with Joel, and when I was with Wilfred. Even when I broke up with Wilfred. To be honest, that was one of the hardest things I ever had to do... break up with him. I can honestly say I loved him. What we had was definitely something special and something I could never forget unless I got into a very unfortunate accident where I lose my memories. This year in grade 8, she was there when I was with Nima and through all the good times and the bad. Finally, this happened and is this the end already? I have no idea.   Would it ever be possible that we get back together as best friends again? I have no idea. It could be possible but it also may not happen. I don't know.   Wilfred said that I would probably have too much pride to say sorry and stuff to fix it up and he's probably right. I do have too much pride sometimes to do certain things. I remember back in grade 4, Rachel and I always fought and always hated then loved then hated then loved each other. We were always fighting. We still ended up being pretty good friends. We were, in other words, inseperable. I've always been the one to set away my pride to apologize and she never was able to do that until later. I don't know why I can't do it now. It's just... unexplainable with words.   I skipped church for Wonderland? I wanted to go to church and then go to Wonderland a little later than everybody and meet up with them there but a few people needed rides and couldn't go unless they had a ride there and my mom wouldn't pick them up on the way to church to pick me up so I had to just go with them.   Katie said "its not like u never skipped cd team!". The thing is, it would've worked if she hadn't been there with me. Everybody has. That makes the statement killed. And the thing is, I didn't have anybody there telling me not to skip.   Everybody I talked to told this to me as politely as possibly because they knew that Erica and I were "best friends" and I just kept quiet about what they said. Basically, they said that maybe it wasn't a good idea to bring Erica and Katie to our church. Bringing more people to church is always good but it probably wasn't the right time to yet. All they had ever done at our church was socialize and mack. Erica always complained about Katie and how all she did was mack and go to church for friends. The thing is, she's doing the  exact same thing . She said "o thx joey for bringing me to church and God" and all that shit, but what is that? Shit!   She complained to me that all these guys were hitting on her and asking her out and then she turns around and goes macking right back and leading them on! When they ask her out, she just rejects them and continues flirting. Not healthy in my opinion.  She thought that I was talking behind her back but I wasn't. I was just talking to Katie about why she skipped. I was actually gonna speak to Erica seperately to see what happened. Katie being there for her? Why do you need someone to be there for you when you're on the phone with your man?! Erica's always complained and bitched about Katie this Katie that and then she goes telling me that Katie was there for her? Okay right whatever.  There's just so many thoughts running through my head and I just have no idea as to how I can arrange them yet. I'm not the one who called off this friendship in one day, okay? She did. If that's all this friendship ever meant to her, then I guess it's fine with me that she calls it off in  one day .   ------------------------------  From the movie Stand By Me, the main character said in the end of the movie that he never had friends in his entire life like the ones he had when he was 12. I find that very true... because once we all grow up and change into our own people, the way we look at things and the way we do things are different and it changes the relationships between us.  ------------------------------   Just one more thing I had to say...  I didn't show it but I was actually disappointed and kind of hurt that she told me to get out of her life. I really did care and I sincerely loved her as a best friend. She meant so much to me... and I don't know if she took me seriously but I meant it when I said she meant more to me than even Nima.
