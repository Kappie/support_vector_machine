I have been taking 4 tylenol at a time and it still doesnt work. bah! today is the family party thing for my brithday which was four days ago..aw. they cancelled riding so I didnt get to go. IT is raining. :) I love the rain. I wish it would rain everyday. sean has a little friend that slept over last night over. I want to die my hair, and cut it. or something. I dont know. I   !r!e!a!l!l!y!  want to do something different with my hair but it is the longest it has ever been so...bah! oh well...it is too bad I just cant walk into some piercing place and say "Pierce me." and they will. dammit I hate being young. -_- my head is all floaty..it doesnt feel attached to my body, maybe thats what happens when you ake too many Tylenol..meh. Maybe i should take some more...nah too lazy. I love Good Charlotte. yes. I still do. I was rediscovering that this morning because I was listening to them and I realized how much I still love their music. t'is true *nods* yes, I wish I could type really fast without looking at the keyboard..I do a fairly good job but not as fast as typing as I do without looking at the screen. maybe I should walk the dog...maybe I should do alot of things but that doesnt mean I'ma gonna do it! Like maybe I should change all the colours on my blog, but I dont paticularly feel like it. whoa. Instead of constantly looking at my hands I keep looking up at the screen. it is like my eyes are drawn to it. o.O he he he I loveth that face.
