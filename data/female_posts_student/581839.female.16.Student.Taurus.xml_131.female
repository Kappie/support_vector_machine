    
       its christmas break, and i start school on monday. dang it, the fact that i have to return to school destroys my whole week, because i know i'll have to start frantically studying for exams. mary is very kindly taking me out to see the sneak preview of "chicago" the musical, along with some of her friends, because i've had a horrible night. anyway, nothing much else is going on. all of my friends are out of town, so it is oh so boring. well i'd best leave. we're leaving in like thirty minutes.  stop! the other half of "to serve man" its, its, its a COOKBOOK!
