I went and got gas earlier, so I missed out on semi-naked Jude Law. What a shame! :(  Lindsey, I hope you are reading this! Work was OK tonight. Got to talk a lot, and there wasn't much stock to put out. Hopefully it'll all be gone tomorrow, and all I'll have to do is that one plan-o-gram, which shouldn't take long. Whee! More goof-off time!  The tree-painting at Buhler Grade has been moved to Sunday, which means I get to sleep in tomorrow. YES!! Which means I have no excuse not to finish BNW:Revisited tonight. Darn.  Which is why I am drinking Dr. Pepper at 10:00 PM. That is, what's left of it after it sprayed all over the kitchen. Including the walls and the floor. *sigh*  Well, hey, I accomplished my goal! I was happy all day long :D   Some people want it all,   But I don't want nothin' at all.   If I ain't got you, babe.   Some people want diamond rings,   and some just want everything.   But I don't want nothin',   If I ain't got you.  -Alicia Keys, the aptly named.
