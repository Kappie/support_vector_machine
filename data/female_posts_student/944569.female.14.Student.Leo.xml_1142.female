If i could name myself a japanese name, it'd probably Saki (Or Sakuno but then ppl would think i'm a freak.  Oh wait, i am)  How long have you liked anime? Since the beginning of time.  I was born for anime.  What was the first anime you ever saw? I dont really remember.  The first few were Prince of Tennis, Love Hina and...Inu Yasha.  I guess Sailor Moon counts as well (though i hate it now)  What was the first song you every heard in Japanese? The Prince of Tennis intro (which is pretty good)  Can you speak some Japanese? i know some words and simple stuff  Can you read any Japanese? Nope.  I can't even read in Chinese very well (yet) ^.^;;;  Do you own anything anime? yes.  lots of stuff.  If you could see my room, every square inch of the wall is covered by anime posters and my desk is filled with anime drawings.  I own a lot of dvds and cds filled with anime too.  Do you have any imported anime items? yup  Do you own a video game system and RPGs like Final Fantasy? All of the Final Fantasy games and lots of other RPGs (Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross..etc)   Favorites   Anime series: Prince of Tennis, Naruto, Inu Yasha  Anime movie: Hmmm...it would be a Prince of Tennis movie if there was one but instead it would be the Inu Yasha movie with the wacky elf guy who controls ppl and makes Kagome grow long nails so that she can throw them at ppl (lol) ^.^  Manga: Prince of Tennis and Naruto  Manga artist: Hm...never thought about that one..  Japanese singer: Er...Utada Hikaru or Yuko Sasaki  Japanese song: Haruka Kanata and all the Prince of Tennis openings and endings ^.^ (I'm such a retard)  Anime opening song: please refer to question above  Anime closing song: Prince of Tennis endings (profound, huh?)  Voice actress: Minagawa Junko  Voice actor: Yamaguchi Kappei, Hoshi Souichirou, Seki Tomokazu~  Japanese snack food: Hm..i eat so many that i lost track.

Flavor of Pocky: Milky Pocky *mmm....sweet and smooth*  Anime character (female): Sakuno from Prince of Tennis.  SA-KU-NO! Sakuno *sweatdropping*:  Anou...it doesnt seem like i'm very popular.  Everyone else wants Ryoma to have a yaio relationship with Momo-senpai...   Anime character (male): Ryoma.  Definitely Ryoma.  I love you Ryoma.  Anime couple: RyoSaku (so original..everyone else seems to want gay relationships within the Seigaku team.  I dont have anything against gay ppl but goddammit!  Ryoma is 12 years old ok?  You cant make a twelve year old have a relationship with a 13/14 year old!  He doesnt even know himself much yet!)  Final Fantasy (including Kingdom Hearts): Final Fantasy 7,9,and 10 and Kingdom Hearts  Non FF RPG: Chrono Cross  Final Fantasy female: Tifa, Garnet, Rhinoa, Rikku (I used to think her name was Rhino.  lol.  Does anyone else notice that these girls all look the same, except for Rikku. It seems that Squaresoft likes girls with dark hair and dark eyes)  Final Fantasy male: Cloud.....Cloud.....Cloud........Cloud....Cloud....did i mention Cloud?    Final Fantasy song or theme: The FF8 beginning song   Have you ever...  Been to a convention: I'd love to but i'm too young and my parents probably wouldnt let me  Cosplayed: I'd love to...if i could sew...  Eaten pocky: *Munching on 60 pocky stick at a time*  Been to an anime store and spent all your money: That would be heaven if i could find an anime store with the best Prince Of Tennis goods ever...  Gotten a plushie of one of your favorite characters: I'm going to get a little Chibi Ryoma keychain maybe.  I'd love one if i had a credit card...in order to order online...

How many anime and FF CDs do you own? too many to say  Can you name all the anime and manga you've seen and read in under a minute? no, that's impossible.  Give me a year or two and i'll be able to piece it together.  Do you consider yourself an Otaku? Crazy anime fan?  yes.  I have no life whatsoever.
