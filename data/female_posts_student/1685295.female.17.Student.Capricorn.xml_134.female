Some tell me, that when I'm alone, the look on my face reflects the hatred I have reserved for every person in the world. Even that little insignificant person, in a far corner of the world, who might feel that I've left them out..I've got them covered too. I frequently get asked "Why are YÃ¶zen's eyes burning with hatred?" or "You look like you're about to kill someone!" or even "GODDAMN YOU'RE STUPID!!" Hmm...maybe that last one's kinda irrelevant.  Luckily, I stayed away from people today, tho I did feel an inkling to go out side and sleep against some building, but indoors is much better... I don't know a lot of words, so...Imma cut this short!  I'm Deadinside, and I am really dead inside...some one's gotta clean this up...  "Mr. Schwarzenegger, what do you intend to do about California's fiscal crisis?" "Uhh...I don't know, I wasn't in a movie about a fiscal crisis."
