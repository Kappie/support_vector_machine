If I told her I was failing everything she'd be more likely to believe me. Apparently she doesn't think that I'm working hard enough or doing enough extra work...bullshit. I'm so fucking overworked my head's going to explode. I guess in her mind, staying up late every night stressing out about tests or huge-ass essays due the next day is "not caring about my future". It's ridiculous. She's already forbidden me to drive for a week, and now she's made me give her all of my teachers' email addresses so she can "make sure" that my grades are what I say they are. I don't even know what other embarrassment she's going to put me through by the end of this year. And moreover, I don't know how much more she can. Maybe when she hears from my teachers that contrary to what she's assuming, I'm NOT failing all of my classes and I'm NOT getting all Bs and I DON'T have any C's. I have a B in Calc right now. That's all. So shoot me, I can't bring my grade up when there's only one frickin' test in it right now. Sorry for posting all of this crap you guys...I just need to vent really bad. Maybe I should go beat up my pillows or something. Too much stuff has happened in the last few months and I'm hoping that spring break is going to give my mind some peace. To Do: Study  Grapes of Wrath , do Bio chapter outline and show it to my mom so she can "be sure that at least I'm doing my homework" because I'm such a slacker and I never do anything. Maybe I should tell her that like I've only been to three days of school this quarter and that I haven't done any homework. That would be fun. See you people tomorrow.
