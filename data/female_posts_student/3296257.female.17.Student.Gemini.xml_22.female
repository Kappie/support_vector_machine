And I have to transfer my "vertical labret piercing" money in to my debt account...so I can spend it…oh no wait...I need that for warped tour…aww man...oh rite cally and maryah both owe me mula! Woo hoo, ima be rich when all that's done with! Man when I type, "comp slang" in word there seems to be MANY spelling and grammatical errors… oh well...ah hahhaha...im such a rebel. Ok now bout last night and this morning...seeing as it is 9:15 am!…holy geeze. Ok so went to bloys house with maryah and neil...ppl were there...only bout five for a while...then ppl got drunk…and fell down…and more ppl came...surprisingly, it never got outta hand...I quite enjoyed it...lol…so then I got home about 1:15...because my mom told me at 11:00 that we were going to leave for the cottage last night...so im thinking that I will come home at a decent time and it'll all be good…so then when I get home my mom tells me that we are going to leave around 6AM!...ok two things wrong with that...I left a party…b4 it was over..AND..I DO NOT get up at 6 AM! And if ur talking 6 pm...then im there…I don't' do mornings. juss in case u were wondering..so then I watched sum tv..very exciting..sum movie on ctv…yay for canadain television..or not…it was a boring movie if I do say so myself. I get to sleep around 2:30..I guess the movie wasn't that bad…ah hahahhahha..Ok so then THREE AND A HALF HOURS later my mom wakes me up and tells me that she is ready to go..holy fucker… I musta look hung over, even though everyone know I don't' drink…so then im attempting to sit up in my bed..with three hours of sleep…it took sum time. then we leave..i listened to sum tunes..while my mom serenaded me with her karaoke with the radio..very exciting..hahahha..then I looked for cute boys in cars. APPARENTLY..no cute boys are driving to their cottages at 6:30 in the morning..ne who..then I listened to sum more tunes..u know me..hardcore rocking out (oh yes). (drive, drive, drive) then we get on my cottage road and I see the saddest thing ever!..a dead baby raccoon awww it was soo cute, cept for the fact that it was dead..then I get into my cottage, help unload the car..and bolt for the laptop…im addicted, what can I say…so ten mins later I have written all this shit..OMG I forgot one thing..its started to pour right around barrie..i was soo excited..then it stopped(very upsetting).and its cold here, very windy..oh and our water pump is fucked..this makes for a very unhappy brittny's mommy…(eekk)..ok im done…if u read this far congrats..this is one LONG blog ok Later Losers
