On Cancer  Take heed its violence distracts you from its beauty its silence its speed  Listen And maybe it can teach you to survive In ways you didn’t imagine More inside you Then I ever was Is the invasion really so foreign?   II. On Mercy   You gave me Nyquil anyway  “Alcohol isn’t for five year olds”   you warned   I was afraid I’d get drunk  you knew better Then to let the dryness in my cough persist You’d only let  one drop of blood actually hit  the pillowcase  sleep mattered more    You figured all I’d remember in the morning was peace and how to swallow again     III. On  Dignity   Make a grand entrance You will be remembered  Exit early enough to be missed It’s nice to be escorted  By someone who understands “Pain for beauty” will know that pinched feet require aid and that a taxicab ride 4 blocks will be necessary  Hair falls flat in humidity Leave a half hour before it does    *Note: This is one of the poems in a series entitled "Reflection on a Gift of Matricide. If the meaning eludes you, yes it IS about euthenasia. I was just afraid it might be mis interpreted out of the context of the series
