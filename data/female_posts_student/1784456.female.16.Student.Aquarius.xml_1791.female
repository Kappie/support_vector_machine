I went shopping today and I got a german army waterproof poncho for £6! Hell it may smell funny but it's gonna keep me nice and dry at Glastonbury! *even if the hippies do give us dirty looks :P* I also bought some stupidly bright pink hair dye and I'm gonna take my inflatable sumo suit. So that means everyone has to watch all of Glastonbury and look out for me cause I'm definatly gonna be on tv! Just a bit scared that someone's gonna try to sumo wrestle me... but it'll be ok. I'll run away screaming. We also got glow in the dark stars to stick on our tent, we still won't be able to find it but it'll look really cool! Eugh slightly too much information on the whole Glastonbury plan. Muhahahaaa but I don't care - it's gonna be loads of fun! Warning kids, too much shopping and smelling funny plastic affects your brain in weird ways.
