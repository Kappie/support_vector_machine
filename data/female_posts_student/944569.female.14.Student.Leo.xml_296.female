Be prepared for a long list for I am in a very rant-ish mood:  - I miss JB and Fruitcake a lot - I miss my friends a lot - I miss Jeffrey and Tiffany - I miss school - Now that there's no school, I have nothing to do - I am forced to go on a ski trip next week with no computers :( or video games :'( or proper living quarters >'( - Now ONE IS WRITING ON THIS ((%#$% BLOG BUT ME!!!!!!! HOW THE ^(%$ DID I EXPECT PPL TO BE INTERESTED IN THIS?!?!? - I'm the only one who enjoys writing and philosophy and typing down my thoughts here - I think I'm the only one who has written quite a number of deep sort of texts [the rest of you havent shown your talents yet....COWARDS!] -I have no self- esteem/ confidence - I feel i am hated [nuff said] - I am hated [ NUFF SAID!] - I think/act in a different way than other people - I wish I wasn't so different, I want to "blend" - I hate myself/ my life/ my thoughts/ my uniqueness - I'm not aggressive enough - I now sound like a really whiny person
