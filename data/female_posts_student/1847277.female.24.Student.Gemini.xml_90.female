Less time on IM, I'm actually behind on email, I haven't been blogging as much as usual.  Some might say that this is a good thing.  But I especially miss my evening IM convos with Calvin, as our schedules just don't seem to be matching up.  :(  But, real life is good.  I'm busy, as always,  but good busy.  Busy by choice.  Not busy by demand.  I mean, I wasn't looking forward to prelims and I didn't like studying for them, and that took up all my time/energy.  I was told that I'd go into brainfreeze the semester after prelims,  but I've kicked it up a notch.  I'm taking four classes, three of which are great, two of which will require tons of work, and I'm getting my prelim paper research off the ground.  And of course I'm taking aerobics classes, and trying to be more social, too.  So that leaves little time for play.  But, that's okay.  I'm happy.  I did have a really good break with Matt, I'm doing things I like, in a few months I'll be in the field, yay!  Anyway, I need to print some articles and start on the prelim paper stuff, so off I go.   :)
