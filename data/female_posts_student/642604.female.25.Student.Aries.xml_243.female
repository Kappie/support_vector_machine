I remember dreaming about planning Robin Truba's wedding, she was renewing her vows but she wanted it to be better than the first time around.  At some point the cops show up and pull Bobby from their back seat and he tells me that he's been wrongfully accused (I don't think it was ever determined what for) and because of this my sister has to drive me down to the police station where on the way back we have to stop off at a bank where Crossett works because aparently she's having some secret affair with him and she's thinking of leaving her husband for him.  But when inside, even though I am outside waiting and pissed off about it cause it's cold (even though it's a summer outdoor wedding I was just planning) I can see Caitlin crying and freaking out which makes me believe that Crossett was telling her that he loves his wife (whom aparently he got married to just before showing up to work) and wants to end the thing with Caitlin.  I don't know what happened because the next thing I know I am back at the wedding which is just beginning and I am taking pictures of all the bridesmaids.  Sherrell was one of them and she kept wanting to look at the pictures of her while she was up there during the ceremony.  I kept telling her to go away and I would show her after the ceremony was over.  I can't remember anything after this, I think I finally woke up....  Peapod delivers this morning between 10-12 and I need to be awake for it!
