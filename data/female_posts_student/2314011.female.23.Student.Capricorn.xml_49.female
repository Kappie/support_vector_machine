But had dreams around 3-4ish about Property exam answers and felt slightly better, as I seemed to know what I was doing in the dream.  Think I was mostly upset at myself for not making the best use of my time, and last night was what finally tipped the scales.  On the one hand, I'm still really glad I went to the panel, but on the other, I'm realizing now, I should have stayed home and studied.  Because, really, there's no more time to waste.  First final's this Monday and I have yet to use the study guides to fill in the gaps in my understanding of Civil Procedure.    Saw the Return of the King trailer just as I was leaving the house and was again motivated.  All the shots of the characters about to meet the challenge they've spent the last 2 movies preparing themselves for; finding out if, after all that, they've really got it in them to do what they must.  "All you have to decide is what to do with the time that's given to you."  And that Gandalf always knows just what to say!
