(but i always do, so it's ok) there are certain times and places for flirting.  i think school is actually an acceptable place, and home is an alright place, out on the town, that's fine...church-off limits! don't be stupid!  some people tho, can't turn it off! and that's not good, i mean i flirt a lot, but only when it's appropriate, and i've noticed in some classes i flirt a lot and in others not at all....it's weird but i was just thinking about it, so u've now been enlightened  i need some music!!! changedfish
