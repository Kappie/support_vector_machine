Didn't go to Earth Science, skipped and went to Centenial with Laura and Dan...walked around all the trails, then walked along the river, and crossed over it, looking for an oxbow lake...Never found it. Discovered Karissa's car was picked up and moved, that was weird. Went to a one-man Lord of the Rings show, that was really, really amazing and funny, holy crap. That guy is gifted. Went to Multimedia, finished my DVD questions, and then started working on my home theater project. Started using Acid Pro for part of it. (Yay, I'm worknig with music again!) Went home, watched some tv, then started working on my lists for CUC....Organzing people into their touch groups and stuff. Will start making packing lists too, cause I'm going to need that.   Missed everyone who was gone terribly today, and it really was no fun in Multimedia without my "hubby" as Mr Ollis calls Nick.   There's this really funny picture in Mr Ollis's office with Nick in a wedding dress with Simon (edited photo, don't worry) and it says "To my darling, Nick." The scary thing is, is that we don't know whether it's refering to the Nick in the picture, or Mr Ollis....I saw that today in his office and we just cracked up.....it's terrible :)  Can't wait till everyone comes back, I want Thursday to last forever (or at least a long time), cause me and Nana really miss Nick and Sean, and the rest of us really miss them all....oh well..in time.  Love you all lotsly, me.
