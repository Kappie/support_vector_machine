The only thing I really need to remember to do is fill out my Visa form, and I guess even if I forgot, I could actually do it in the airport in Nairobi.  And I suppose I ought to email the director so he remembers to have someone pick me up.  I am quite psyched about going to the UK.  I'll see Dave for the first time in over 2 years, I'll hopefully hang out with Noah for a bit, and I'm going to dinner with Caleb and his fiancee, and, actually, it's probably been over 2 years since I've seen Caleb, too.  And I get to be reunited with my luggage.  I swear I'll kiss it when I see it.  I don't care how filth-encrusted it is (cause it was pretty nasty after Montenegro)..
