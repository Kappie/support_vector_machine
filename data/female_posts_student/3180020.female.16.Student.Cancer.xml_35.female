Monday  Well, I got up at 7:30 and got a shower and got me and Nate ready, then me and daddy and nate went to the place to get my license.  At 10 they still hadn't called me to do my paper work so I had to leave b/c I had a dentist at 10:30 and I had already rescheduled it twice.  So anyway, I got back for the dentist around 12 and I fixed dad and Nate lunch, then dad had to go to work at 12:30 so momma came and got me and I went back to the place to get my license.  At like 2:30 I was finally a licensed driver.  so after that I took mom to her work and I ran home to get my photo album and Elizabeth's birthday present. then me and nate went to wal*mart to make copies of some of my pictures from Dauphin Island to send to Elizabeth.  After wally I went to the post office to mail her birthday present then I went to my grandma's and chilled for about an hour until I had to go pick mom up from work.  That night jordan took the computer to his house b/c he was gonna get it fixed the next morning at work.  Thats all i can remember for that day.    Tuesday  well, I got up at 10:30 and just hung out around here for a little while, at about 12:30 I took Nate to mom's office b/c he was going to go bowling with the church.  After that I went to eat at Pikeville with melissa and then I took her to the doctors office to get an allergy shot.  After that we went back by mom's office to get her car and then we went swimming at her house.  It was fun.  I came home at like 6 got a shower and got ready and me and mom left to go to BV.  We met jana, kristen and melissa to eat.  It was fun. After that me and mom came home and I called daddy to ask him if i could go out and he said yeah.  Mom was pissed about it and that made me happy b/c there was nothing she could do about it.  Dad said I had to be home at 12!!! and I was pumped as hell.  I left here at like 10 something and met jana and chelsea at T.B. to drop off my car b/c I didn't wanna drive around the square.  *I know Im a chicken* So after we figured out there was NO ONE there, we left and went to T.B. to get my car and we all went to Ruby Tuesday's.  after a lil while we decided to go back to the square and hang out for a minute.  Jay backed my car up for me b/c I dont like to do that either! thanks babe.  Anyway, so....jana and chelsea in jana's car, jay and lacretia in jay's car and me in my car, we all head to the square.  I rode around once and thought I was gonna die b/c tray about made me go deaf when he saw me driving.  AWWW.....anyway, I stayed there and talked for a little while and then everyone was going to the rec*com to play ball so I left and went over there with cretia in my car.  Jay had jeans on and didn't feel like driving "his shit" so I took him to his cousins to get some wind pants and then I dropped him and cretia off at the rec*com and left.  sorry for yelling at you tray...you know i aint got nothin but love for ya!    Wednesday  well, I went to bed at 5:30 this morning and got up at 8 to watch nate...I didn't do much of anything but sit...mack came over and hung out for a while... I went to church with mom...great fun...today was boring
