He payed for both of us. I love that kid. :) That seriously made my day because not many guys are that polite anymore. YaY Brandon. Way to be polite! :) It was exciting at first though. I actually made plans. I never make plans. Maybe I'll try to make up for it by making plans again tomorrow or something. I feel bad that I had to go home in the middle of my own planned thing. Grrr.   Oh well. Such is life. I think I'm going to go sleep now since I really really don't feel well. Hopefully I'll be better by tomorrow.
