The test was easy but I hoped that I would pass it with flying colors or at least pass.....Today I had my History test. I was so nervous that I had studied the whole chapter in case I have miss out anything!!...*what a tough day*...I got my exam papers and then it was easy!!I mean really easy things that I did not study came out!!Like"one lesson you learn from Maria Hertogh riot"and "what does Mendeka means?" I really did not know what to write in answer. I am really worried about my history test. I think that I would be able to scrap some marks....*What am I talking about!!*...History is my favorite subject! ...My friend Amanda has fogotten about have ex-boyfriend and she is finding another guy and she is already aiming for this cute guy which I think that he is so not that great!!..*don't mean to offend my friend!!*..anyway I wanna say that I wish everyone in Bedok North Secondary school a good luck in the exams!!gotta go.Write in later!!
