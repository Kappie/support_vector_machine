This year I am making Bailey my co-team captain so that he get more involved with the cause. He has been very involved in the past in making some suggestions and also writing the letters that we send out, but he is older now and knows a great deal about his condition and I want him to be able to voice out with pride why we do this as a family.    I would appreciate very much if you share this link with friends and family and that you all get involved with us because it certainly means a lot especially after finding out that he may soon need a pacemaker. I want to be more active because this is my son I am talking about and he means a great dela to me, so if I have to go out there and tell everyone I know and then some, I don't care. People can get annoyed all they want, but if they have seen their child through the amount of hardships I watched Bailey go through, they would be doing the same. I firmly believe that each one of us can make a difference by not only donating money, but donating our time and efforts to such worthy causes.    I am just happy to know that I am teaching the value of this to my son while he is young. I am proud to have gotten him involved so early and at a young age because he will grow up being more active in his health, not only through education, but through participation.     urlLink Bailey's Heartwalk Page     For those of you able to donate, THANK YOU! For those of you just able to pass it along. THANK YOU! For those who have always been behind us, praying with us...THANK YOU! I am so blessed with such a wonderful support group.
