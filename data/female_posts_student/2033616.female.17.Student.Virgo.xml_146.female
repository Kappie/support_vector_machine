I will be gone for three weeks but not three weeks straight... i will be back on the weekends so i suppose i will be able to say hello to people then but i will be much to busy doing laundry to do anything.  Anyway, i am very very very very very very excited for camp.. both rimrock and okoboji for both camping and counseling.. so... i thought i would leave you with the above pictures to show you i am having a good time yay.  Have a wonderful 4th everyone.  Send me comments if you love me :-)
