I am also an idiot.   "They're just not the brightest tool in the shed." --Veronica, during AP Language.  Oh, the irony of that comment. Times two.  Gah I'll never get to my list of stuff to talk about!  I've been sick again...so that's thrown me off schedule...  Well I'll try to get to most of it. I AM sorry.  Kind of.  Oh, but I should get to the Salute Your Shorts stuff, while I remember...  Does anyone remember Ben Stein being on that show?  Haha...yay!  Also, the guy that played Budnick was in these two bands...one was called (get ready) Bad4Good.  It was like...some metal band in the early 90s composed of teens...which, is really weird.  Apparently he was the vocalist.  I wonder if he sang such charming lyrics as he did in the opening theme of the show...anyway he did a bunch of cartoon voices too...like Invader Zim...i can't remember who he was. Oh well.  I wonder what happened to Donkey Lips and Sponge...i've seen "Ug" in a bunch of commercials and whatnot...hmm...Salute Your Shorts was NOT wonderfully-written or even a show that had great acting. However, when I was younger I thought it was the greatest thing since string cheese.  Well, maybe not THAT good.  But I enjoyed it. Classic Nickelodeon...those be the days.  Now, I feel a little old.  I'm 17, yet still...I feel a bit old.
