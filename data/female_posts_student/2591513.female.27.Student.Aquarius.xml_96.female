That layout, although very beautiful reminded me a lot about the baby we lost.  I don't know why or how to explain it, so I thought this would make me feel better.  It actually reminds me of my youth, when we used to have parties at shoreline park in Long Beach.  Remember that?  Those were the days.  Let's see, Mother's Day was simple, but I must say the gifts I got yesterday meant more to me than any material thing.  Bailey gave me a pin and project he made at school.  I loved it.  IT was so sweet.  Then he served me heart shaped waffles and scrambled eggs that he and his daddy made.  Ed was so kind and sweet to do that for me.  The days are going by quickly and I am thinking more and more about Ed having to go to Iraq....and then that around this time we should have been preparing for our baby...the ladies pregnant along with me are preparing for their children and I guess a large part of me is still mourning that.  I am sad with the weight.  I have seen pictures and I can't believe I am this BIG.  I just keep telling myself I need to do something about it and stop saying I will and not do anything...but I don't know what it is.  I think it is discouragement that after these many years I haven't been able to do anything about it...why will it change now...or maybe I just don't believe in myself.  I don't know.  I am very very discouraged by my weight...  Anyway,forgive my pessimism.  I am sick...I forgot to say that.  I have two ear infections, a sinus infection and strep.  Just thank God I am alive right?  I need to learn that change in my health and in my body image will be slow but well worth the effort.  Just pray for me that I have the courage to move forward and make a change because not only is my body not healthy at this point, my mental well being as well.  I know feeling this unhappy about me isn't good.   I don't know if I will be taking summer classes.  I don't have the money for books and things of that sort.  Oh well.  We will see.
