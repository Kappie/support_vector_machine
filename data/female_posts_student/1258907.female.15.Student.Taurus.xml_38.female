I'll never forget my teachers and how they made sure it was never a bore.  I learned to write And how to draw And the things I should never do.  The key was to  Trust And dont you forget  Respect Is also a key, Responsibility Was never frowned upon And  Fairness  is a guarentee, Caring  always helps And Citizenship Is the key to agree.  So throughout the years I spent at school And all the work I've done  I'll never forget the things that count Especially at Addams, with Character Counts.
