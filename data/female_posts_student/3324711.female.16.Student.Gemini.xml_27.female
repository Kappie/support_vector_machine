The weather is getting warmer [slowly, but still..]  School is out [nonofficially] in 3 days, 2 exams next week, and then  SUMMER !  Until then, I must study. So Im off.  And so far, Im doing pretty good with the whole not-spending-as-much-time-on-the-computer-thing.    Listening To: Moby Dick- Zeppelin
