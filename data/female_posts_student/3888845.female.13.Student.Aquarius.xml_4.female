I t did go a nice colour though, it was like a   purple   kind of colour, It was ok.....Kind of......It looked nice.....Ok ok it was....Any way she liked it that's all that mattered!       Right now I am munching on a really big 'Joey' Sandwich, (that's what my friend says, The      obsessivelittle 'Friends' Fan, that ring any bells LIZZIE??)      It was made off : Ham, chicken, turkey, pepperoni, cheese, tomato sauceand BBQ sauce!      YUM!!!    On my way to the beach concert to see 'Malibu Stacey' and 'Alex Bach'!!     Bye x x
