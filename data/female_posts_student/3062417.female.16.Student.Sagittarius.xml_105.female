Then we drove around and went to Father Webber's house and hung out for a while. Then he drove me home. But I didn't even get shotty 'cause stupid Gregg was there (sad face). And I didn't get a hug good-bye either (another sad face). Oh well I still had fun. Atleast I got out of working on my project for a while. So now I'm working on my project (not fun) and listening to Less Than Jake.  Listening to: [Ghosts Of You And Me by Less Than Jake]  I've been down wandering past 2nd street and looking at the ghosts of you and me and thinking back on all those memories of how we used to be  I've been hearing hear those voices of the noises of the breaking glass and all those plans we had to get us through they're never coming true  And I hope and hope that you won't forget and I hope you, hope you know that I can clearly see  The ghosts of you and me 'cause I'm just a long-gone memory and you're still alive and I'm still getting by on these dead end streets the ghosts of you and me  I'm still talking talk of what we'll do to the ghosts of me and you and I'm still looking back into the past when we were all we had  And I hope and hope that you won't forget and I hope you, hope you know that I can clearly see  [Chorus] the ghosts of you and me [x2]  Hope you won't forget hope you know that I'll always regret those things I said hope you know that I can clearly see  [Chorus] the ghosts of you and me [x3]  Yeah
