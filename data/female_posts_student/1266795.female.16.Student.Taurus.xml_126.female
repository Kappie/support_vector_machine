I spent half an hour curling my hair and getting all dolled up for dinner and a concert with my college friend and her boyfriend, and now we're rescheduling the concert because of the rain.    Anybody want to get together with me and do something? I asked Mom if she had any alternatives to Plan A, but her Plan B wasn't all that great. "You know, we can go to the movies!"    The movie theater. Where it's dark for a vast majority of the time you spend in it. Where people can't see the work I put into my hair. *tear* Wow... I sound completely superficial, but I took the time to make myself look pretty. I want people to see it, like Chris Rock's line: "Heck, if I got a Jaguar or Mercedes, I wouldn't want those tinted windows. I want people to see who had the money to buy it!" (That was major paraphrasing, but you get the idea.)    That's the end of my rant. Good night!    EDIT : Idragged Dad to Broad Ripple, where we ate at La Jolla and people-watched. (Thank you, Ash, for entertaining me, though! :P )   "Shall we go to bed?"
