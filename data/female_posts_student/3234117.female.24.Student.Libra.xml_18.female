I was thinking about this as I was leaving class today.  Why can't we want things we  can  have?  Wouldn't it be nice to think, it sure would be nice to have a yellow shirt today to wear and then think, oh I have a yellow shirt?  Why is it that everyone searches for the things in their life that they don't or can't have and want them?  It's crazy.  No one goes to therapy because they are unhappy that they have all the things they wanted.  Most of the times, it's because something is missing that they can't or don't have.  For me, the thing that I want I can't have is to be married and have a dog and our own place.  Now, it's not really so much that I can't have that, I'm just not ready for that.  I'm not at that place in my life, it just sounds nice.  Really I also just want a dog and know I need someone else around to help me with it.  Would I be happy if I were no longer single? I don't know, I'd probably want a bigger house, a nicer husband, a baby, more money, etc.  So why can't I rejoice in my singlehood and live it fully?  I mean what could be better to be young, hot, and single? I'll never be all these three things again.  I know I'll always be hot :) What other point in my life can I have passionate sex with different guys every night?  Okay well maybe it would be passion less , but still.  I guess then I'd be a whore.  So why is it that we focus so much of our attention on the things we do not have?  Anyone know? It's like a car.  I get a new car, I've been wanting a new car, now I have this new car and it's dirty, it's losing it's new car smell, and now I'm ready for a new one.  I have an odd feeling I've heard this analogy before, but anyway I'm transgressing.  Why can't we all just be happy with all that we have in our lives at any given moment?  Okay well I degress.
