She's funny and easy to get along with... I forsee many many parties and drinking sessions! *rolls eyeballs* Die lah... Too much fun and soon enough I'll forget my own name!  I had a good weekend.    THURS:  Clubbed @ Chicane...with Kimberly, Kelvin (my cuz), Linh from school and his frien Ben but without Andrew! Yah...can you imagine that? but I was a very very very good girl okay! I drank a bit too much tho and I was too pissed to do anything but crash on my bed when I got home.     FRI:  Clubbed again... at the Loft this time... Nice place with heaps of hotties! Too bad Andrew came along this time. But hey, I'm not looking to pick up so it didn't really matter. In fact, i'm glad he was there. *smoochies for Mr Rugby playa* haha... *makes a 'V' sign with my hands*     SAT:  went shopping for groceries at Prahran Market and baby and I made this YUMMY lamb and eggplant curry! We hung out all day at home and then finally in the evening we headed down to Borders to have a read and some coffee. GUESS WHO WE SAW?!!?!? We saw Shane Crawford... Who?? Did I hear you saw who!? He's the captain of my fav footy team, Hawthorn! Man he's a serious hottie... *laughs*     I'm so tired now... I had such a tiring day at class! First I did a set and then I was asked to be a model for a beauty class. They made me lie there naked and then they exfoliated my body, and then they did a seaweed wrap and finally I was given an oil massage... How tiring is that man? *evil chuckle* Okay okay... I'm a byotch! I had a friggin good day!  And now... I shall bid good night to all you sweeties!  ***** 1-2-3-4-5 kissies for my CB Rugby Playa
