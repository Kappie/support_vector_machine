I think I'm falling apart again.  I'm falling again. Slipping under the sea of emotions only this time... i don't know whos hand to grab...and the longer I hover in between reality and drowning...the more confused I become... and the more confused I become the faster I slip.  What do I want? Who do I want? Where are my priorities? Why do I again feel so upside down? What's important to me? What do I want in life? Where do I want to be 5 years from now..... who do I want to be with?  I'm breaking my own rules again. I suck at that.  I miss Michael. Desperately. So much it hurts, seriously. I'm on the verge of tears again. I had a panic attack that I couldn't remember what he looked like or who he was. It'll be a year in 9 days.... he was always so good at chasing my doubts away. One hug and my worries melted, troubles were gone and I felt safe. It didn't matter if I was angry at him or not.  That's what I want again... I want that kind've security back.... but I'm afraid to go back to the only person that was capable of making me feel that way.  Change is scary. Ugh I suck. Would SOMEONE up there give me some guidance for once!?..... no no.. I know... its one of those growing up things... I gotta learn the lesson myself.  Lessons are stupid. Ignorance is worse.  I went to see The Day After Tomorrow tonight. Good movie, shook me up.. heh.. but i'm the kind that gets shook up by environmental disaster... Love the Earth.. before She's gone.  Love your friends before they get t-boned by a drunk driver and are gone the next morning......  I should probably stop now. Goodnight.
