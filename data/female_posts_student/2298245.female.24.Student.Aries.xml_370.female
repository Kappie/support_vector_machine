I was going to stop there, but I figured that such a bold and impressive statement such as that might require more explanation.  The story begins with when Christina took me to see  Assassins  for my birthday.  A slight digression here...I'm a major Sondheim freak, who has enjoyed every production I've ever seen of one of his shows, no matter how bad it might have been objectively speaking.  But this production of  Assassins , currently running on Broadway at Studio 54, is definitely, objectively speaking worth seeing.  The production was originally meant to run over two years ago, but it was halted post 9/11 both for the general nature of the show - because it is about a bunch of people who want to kill, and some who do kill, the President of the United States - and the specific instance of Samuel Byck, a would-be assassin who plotted to kill Nixon by flying a plane into the White House.  Understandably postponed.  But now it is here, and it is a very good production.    Bet you're wishing I'd get to the point, so I will.  One of the actors in the show was so familiar to me.  Yet I couldn't place him.  And not just familiar in the "oh I've seen him in something before," but that something could be anything, and certainly not important to you.  No, this guy was familiar from somewhere very specific and very important - I could tell, yet I still couldn't place him.  There was no intermission in the show, so I couldn't look it up, and by the end I was so enthralled by the production, and very into talking to Christina since I don't get to see her as often as I used to when we were roommates, so there's always more to say (as I recall I'd also had a particularly bad day that day, and I just now recalled something that happened to me that day that was especially strange, especially after everything else, but that's for another day since I've already had too many digressions).  On the train ride home it didn't occur to me either - instead I perused some Fitzgerald short stories.  Anyway, several days later it finally occurred to me to look him up in the Playbill and find out his name:  Denis O'Hare.  He played Charles Guiteau, who assassinated James Garfield.  He was very good in the show, but then Guiteau is something of my favorite (if you can really pick a "favorite" assassin) in the show.  I scanned his bio, and he seems pretty famous by Broadway standards, but I've not seen him in any other show before.  Then, I see it toward the end of his bio, something that is seen so often when I go to the theater that I'm surprised it didn't occur to me sooner that this might be the connection.  That, of course, is the ubiquitous Law  Order credit.  That said, even reading this was not my "A-Ha" moment.  After all, there are a great many episodes of the show, and while I've seen a great many of them, I still had the feeling that my connection here was something more than a tenuous connection to some random episode of the show.  And how right I was, as I found out last night.  After my long day of study, I arrived home (after a debacle at the local Wendy's - again, a subject for another time) and started doing the only thing I have the energy for any more in the evenings, watching TV.  TNT had one of their marathon evenings of  Law  Order  episodes, so I tuned in, only halfway watching, mildly interested but also distracted by other things.  Then, at 11:03 or so, I looked up at the TV, and something clicked in the back of my head.  Surely this wasn't one of my very favorite episodes ever.  I got up and went over to the TV, and sure enough it was indeed what I'd consider my very favorite episode of the show ever, one from season 6 entitled "Pro Se."  And then, even though he wasn't to enter the world of the show for a while longer, I got an image of the defendant from this episode, and I realized that it was him.  Sure enough, when his face appeared on screen a little latter, ratty though his appearance was, it all came together.  Mr. O'Hare was not just on any episode of  Law  Order , he was on my very favorite episode, performing one of the best guest appearances I've ever seen on the show.    I, sadly, felt very validated in this moment.  But hey, you take any validation you can get, right?  As an aside, he was in one of my very favorite episodes of the  Law  Order  spinoff  Special Victims Unit,  where we see that Dr. Skoda (the shrink played by the very cool J.K. Simmons, who was guest star on  Without a Trace  this Thursday - anyone think I watch too much TV?) is more than a curmudgeon, that he actually has a heart as well.  But I digress yet again.  I really gotta work on that.  Uh...yeah.  I'm going back to work now.
