And I'll do it, damn it, because I'm lazy and also because I have an extra set of clothes in the guard room. Go me. Tomorrow it's full band, no longer just rookies and freshmen. Which sucks, because I can't be superior to my freshman friends anymore. :-P And also that people who are more likely to have a predisposed opinion of me. Meaning that I have to deal with people who think I'm a huge spaz. I've changed so much over the summer. Although I'll probably still harass Chris about his purse...is he even in band? I think he is...most of my friends are in band.  Good thing: I can see all the people I care to see. I really DO have fun, even if they aren't people I would consider great friends. Maybe I'll actually get invited to stuff this year. Which reminds me, I must now never let anybody who attends school with me to see this blog...  I hope Miranda didn't drop out like she said she would. I know Agneatha's getting her GED, but Miranda was so awesomely cool that it would suck if she left. Even if she thinks all feminists have saggy boobs...she won't be in choir anymore, but maybe we'll have some stuff together. We had great fun in Algebra 2, me and her and Laurie. Ooh, and I can't wait to see Lana. She's great, insulting and really sweet at the same time. It's really weird, for having no friends, I sure miss a lot of people. I have so many acquaintances, so many people I have fun with, but none of them know me. I'm the quiet girl, the loud girl, the crazy girl, the crafty girl, the smart girl...but nothing more.  This is depressing me. I must now wallow. Yay! :-)
