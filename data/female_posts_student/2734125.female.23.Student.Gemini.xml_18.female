The waters were rough, when are they not? We walked until we found a gazebo in an inlet.  The waves would rush into the bottom half of the gazebo every 45 seconds, and on the floor there was all sorts of sea life.  We took off our shoes, and there were other kids there.  There were seals and dolphins, even though the dolphins were out of place in what seemed like a northern place.  A pair of twin girls had been swimming with the dolphins on the other beach, but here in the gazebo there was less room.  One seal had a zipper on its stomach, and I thought it might be a magickal animal that had a person inside, so I unzipped him.  Inside were different sea animals, and they were all stuffed plush toys.  I quickly rezipped him.  Then we looked at shells; they were really brilliant glowing, oil on water slick polished wet glowing.  One that I picked up was a huge cowry shell that had silver and red on it.  Another was a jeweled peach and sand color.  I asked the other kids if we were allowed to take them, and they said no.   Its too bad really, as I would have liked to have one when I woke up, and more and more were washing ashore...
