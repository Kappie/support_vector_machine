Moore (arts and crafts store where the old bi-lo used to be near the mall) uup, now its midnight:01 wow....im coming here to write about my books that im reading currently, i just finished reading Rebecca, which was very good, it had a lot of plot twists and confusing details, i didnt realize there were so many details til i tried explaining it to my mom and it took forever and she had no clue what i was talking about.....its a novel of romantic suspense as said by the front cover, its not a bi-lo novel even tho ive never read one, but it kinda looks like it COULD be one....its pretty actually....the twist at the end is pretty freaky and if you get bored with it, keep reading cuz you'll like the end....im also reading The Case For Christ, which is a journalist's search for evidence of Jesus and if he actually existed and scientific and archeological proof and how we can rely on what the Bible says, very good book, its kind of like a book of interviews because he goes and talks to a bunch of people who are experts in their field and he records it and thats pretty much whats in the book, im barely half way done with it, if that, but it draws you in if youre at all interested in the topic, note to the dumb(as in stupid), you might have a hard time reading this book cuz theres a lot of big words...., vacation bible school was this week at our church, finally its over...it was so much fun though, the theme was "The King is Coming!" it was all medieval and stuff....lotsa fun, i was a 5 yr old class teacher thing(more like assistant, but whatever....) me and Jordan(other assistant) did a whole lot of the work....it was mostly herding and shushing...taking them to places and making them shut up whenever grownups were talking....the best part was the shark song....best in the world...it has hand motions and a catchy little tune that you will sing for MONTHS(!!!), it goes like this.... "baby shark do doo do do do do (repeat 3x) baby shark" then you go....."momma shark do doo do do do do (repeat 3x) momma shark" and you do the same for "daddy shark", "grandma shark", "goin swimmin", "shark in the water", "swimmin faster", "shark attack", "CPR", "its not working", "goin to heaven", "gonna see Jesus", and the best one is "break it down" all of these have motions, if you wanna it, just ask....i'd be more than happy to share it with you......well, im going on a kayaking/canoeing trip with my parents and some other people, i have to leave at 9:30, which is early for me, so i better go to sleep now(which will be the record for the earliest i have gone to bed this summer....).....have a nice life, and i will be back with my life report soon..... XOXO ~stace~
