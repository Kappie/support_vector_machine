I have to say I like the preschoolers the best . Half the time they don't listen at all and they don't understand the games sometimes but they're so funny. Like this one little girl Ashley has the best manners, and she always has a purse, though what a 4 year old needs a purse for I have no idea. Then there's Owen, he doesn't listen much, but he is the cutest little boy. Today during snack Ashley was like "Owen, nice manners! Chew with your mouth closed!" It was hysterical. They're so funny. They love tug 'o' war. We had all the preschoolers on one side and me and my mom on the other side. They "beat" us and went around telling everyone how strong they were. And then being at VBS makes me feel like I have huge muscles. Because, for some reason there's always less girls, so my mom will tell the boys that the girls get to have me on their side and they're all like "NO! THAT'S NOT FAIR! WE'RE GONNA LOSE!" It's great, I felt like the Hulk this week. Oh and the preschoolers, can be not listening at all and their teacher can be like "Simon says, sit down." and they all do. Just who is Simon? And why does he hold this strange power over 4 year olds?
