BTW, Sublunary is a great yaoi manga hosted on keenspace!) When I was saving the scan to my folders, the program froze, so I tried to get a reaction out of my computer, so I selected 'empty the trash'. Is there any way that by selecting that, I could have deleted my folders??  All the stuff on the desktop is gone (and other stuff like msn, but I just downloaded it again), as well as everything in my folders. INCLUDING MY ART AND STORIES! I'm utterly pissed. Hope there's a way to fix that, or I might just cut my head off and stuff it with cotton.  *grumbles* In other news, I'm going out with some friends tonight to shop and see Harry Potter (I'm seeing it again, wheee).
