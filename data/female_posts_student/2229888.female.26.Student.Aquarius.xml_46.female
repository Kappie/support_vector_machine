When the preacher called us up, ant was outside calling work to let them know he would be late... it as embarrassing for him... he saw us up front and cam running down the aisle...  the baby just looked around at everyone! When the preacher sarted talking, the little baby sneezed twice and everyone laughed... he was a happy little guy right up until we took him outside and put him in his carseat! :)  Ant has been so awesome... his good attitude has held up so far... he's the best daddy... he knows how to quiet the baby when no one else can...
