Had the family over and all that good stuff so it was fun.. got alot of swimming done. Then my great big " finale" was on the 20th. Guess where I got to go? NYC! Oh it was soo much fun! I got to see the play Chicago, and let me tell you the movie has nothing on the broadway play. Paige Davis did an awsome role as Roxie Hart and the person who played Velma blew me away. I feel bad I can't remember her name, but she was really good. We stayed there for 5 days it was a mucho enjoyable trip. I found out it was a very friendly place. So many people kept hitting on me.....yea I could learn to deal with that! My sister is over right now it was her birthday on the 22 so since me and my dad were gone we are celebrating it right now! Yeah the nieces are over and they love me so much! haha Whenever you need a lift just call them. They could make the devil happy! haha I think thats about that minus some more great news! My OH so wonderful loverly beautiful burnette with the gorgous curly locks of hair * that a mouth full* is coming to see me!!! If you don't know who I am talking about let me tell you...its Brianna!!!!! OI love her so much! She is my sun! lol ok i'll stop now. I think that is about it. For all you people in South Carolina that care I come home in 13 days! Well MUCH LOVE!
