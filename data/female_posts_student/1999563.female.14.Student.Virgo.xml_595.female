So today I woke up at 8 and I went to my brother best friends house. haha. they are moving to Yakima [the middle of NOWHERE!!] so I helped 'em move. There were all these random guys there. It was weird. tehre was this one guy there and his name was Kyle and I could not figure out his age. It was so weird. Liek when I first looked at him I though he was like 15..but when he talked he looked like he was liked 18. Cuh-razy!! For most of the time my mom and I packed boxes. I got the BEST job of them all. I got to label the boxes!! I drew pretty pictures all over the boxes/ Like for a box of purses and aprons I put "Pretty Purses and Angry Aprons" and ont he box the drew a bunch of smiling purses. they were totally blonde they were like "Woohoo! Moving is fun!" then I drew angry aprons who said stuff like "GET ME OUT OF THIS BOX!" it was great.  I hope they like it in Yakima! They are going to be working at this place called the "Flying H Ranch" it's where toubled teenage boys go. I think they will be able to serve a lot and enjoy it.  Fun stuff!!  Taylor from CYT called and my first HYPE meeting is on Wednesday!! Isn't that exciting? It's a barbeque and there is going to be a pool there. Which is kinda dumb because I hate to siwm but oh well, it will be fun! Bekah will be there WOOOHOO!! Haha. Exciting times.  I think when I get home I will probably "preach it" but you all are probably sick of my pages and pages of "inspiration"   Adios Amigos!  laura Fantora
