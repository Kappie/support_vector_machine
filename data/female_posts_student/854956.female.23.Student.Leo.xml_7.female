However, now that all this rain has hit, they've been closing off lanes on 410... and I don't wanna sit in traffic all afternoon just to get to Druck's.  As for my day at school, it was okay.  Psychology was funny... very funny.  And that cute guy (that I told Melissa about) was there, and even though he sat on the other side of the room (because my side was full by the time he got there) he waved at me.  It was weird, because he's only talked to me once.  I didn't see Michael Prewoznik today, but I DID see Shannon's friend.  While I was waiting outside my psychology class, I put some lotion on my tattoo, so it wouldn't get all dried out.  Anyhow, this guy who was standing outside the class as well saw me and said, "That's a cool tat!"  It was odd.  I guess I'll have to get used to people looking at my leg from now on.  Anyhow, after psychology I had biology 2.  It went by pretty fast, the professor was telling us all about Gene Flow and such.  Anyhow, as I was leaving Biology, I was hoping that it wouldn't be raining very hard.  Boy oh boy!  It was raining so hard, there was like, 2 inches of water in the parking lot.  So, I got to walk through 2 inches of water all the way to my car, and of course people are jerks, so they drive by you fast and splash water all over you... I actually threw my fist up in the air at someone and said "Bastard", Melissa-style.  :-)  It was a long walk to the car.  Then I checked my phone and saw that I had a message from my Mom.  She was telling me that they had said on the news that there was some flooding at 281 and 1604.  So, of COURSE I was ecstatic about the drive home.  And of course, all this happens on the day that I want to get some errands run.  Anyway, so while I'm driving home, as I'm getting close to Stone Oak Pkwy, I see like, 4 police cars on West bound 1604 doing U-turns in the grassy median and gettin onto East bound 1604.  Then I look up ahead of me and see a fire truck, and some other police cars, and as I get even closer, I see a white pickup truck on it's side in the bit of grass between the entrance ramp and the hwy.  They were attempting to get someone out of the vehicle.  The vehicle which was FACING opposing traffic, on its side.  It freaked me out.  I guess it hydroplaned or something.  Anyway, so I get home, and I had called Druck and told him I wasn't going to try and get all the way over to his apartment today, that we'd do it another time, because I still wanted to try and get some errands run, but I would have to wait till the rain let up, and such.  But he's on his way over here as I type to pick up the Algebra books that Wolf sent for him and to use my computer to type up something for class tomorrow.  So, I'll still get to see him, but don't have to risk MY life to do so.  ;-)  On another topic, I had emailed Nelson last night, just to see what all was going on with him and the family and how the drumline/band stuff is going for him in Houston.  He emailed me back a LONG email... it was nice to hear from him, and he and I plan on keeping in touch.  Okay, now I go because I have to welcome my guest once he arrives!
