Then I was like starving to me, chels, ash, alicia, and sarah all went to Wendy's for lunch and I got myself a Chicken BLT salad with a big lemonade!  Yum!  Then we went back to the school to get something of Chelsey's and well we decided to see her sis and then we saw Mrs. J which we totally admire and think she is so cool and awesome.  It was nice to talk to her and see her again.
