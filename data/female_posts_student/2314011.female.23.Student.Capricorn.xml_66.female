Not only did she call to admit an error in understanding an assignment, which takes more courage than any of us are willing to admit, I mean really, but she also stopped to help victims in a collision.  She made fire from grass and toilet paper, boiled water and made them all herbal tea to heal their wounds.  And it worked!  Plus, she threw down on a wimpy on-looker, who probably deserved a kick in the balls to start with, but, in her infinite wisdom and patience (that's right!  Patience!), our heroine knew the man's humiliation in the face of her bravery, poise and unwavering commitment to preserving all that is good and pure in humanity was punishment enough.  Let's help her think up a name for her embryonic blog, shall we?
