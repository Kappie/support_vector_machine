I also ran into it when I wanted to copy a cross stitch pattern from a magazine.  Yikes!  It's very technical and confusing.  I will remember that if I have an emergency situation in my music class, that I have a bit of breathing space.  I didn't think about the internet not being part of public domain.  I really wouldn't have thought that shareware and freeware would be copyrighted.  It's nice to see the sites that can be used for instruction for classrooms.  The one with about the Harbour was cool.
