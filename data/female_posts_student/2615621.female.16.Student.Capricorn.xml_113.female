Now, first i was thinking...wow u know this kid fits my list, i could talk to him a lil over the net, meet him when i get home, and u know, maybe my luck will roll around and we'll hit it off. BUT, Danny boy has a gf. Now according to joe, and get this, joe thinks everything is "sexy as hell" from me to the old lady who sits in the front pew at church with her cane and hearing aids. So, i know joe will tell danny good things whether its "dude shes hot" to "dude shes freakin awesome" i know good things will come outta his mouth. But thats not my point, my point is dannys girl. According to joe, shes "ewww" shes kinda punkish, not to put down punk girls, joe even likes them. But he said..absoulutly not to this chick. How bad can she be? Her bf fits my god damn list and my list is nuttin but my materalistic childish dreamy point of views, and nothing on that list had to do with really personality, it was more of a lifestyle and fashion to be honest. BUT, how bad could he really be, he fits my list!! So how did this "ewww" girl get such a "great" guy (according to my list) haha i love talkin about my "list" it...it sounds so stupid. haha but anyways, joe told me that him and danny have the same taste in girl, execpt he doesnt know why danny likes/liked that punk girl (he doesnt know if they are still together) but then he said "if that means anything" my problem with joe is he talks about me all dreamy eyed to his GIRLFRIEND. and his gf and i are friends. Makes her upset i know, i wish he'd stop. but it could be to my advantage..that means he'll tell danny lots of nice things. lol Did i mention danny also plays guitar and drives a jeep?? those things were on the list. haha I havent even met danny yet and im already like DAMMIT HES TAKEN..lauren totally hit the nail on the head with that one! She was right, im getting obessed with a dude i dont know. but he fits my list!! hahaha  I was sittin here on the computer talkin to lauren and joe and of course im a very loud person, so i yell OMG NOOO FAIR!! when i heard joe thought danny had a gf, and well the bug man let himself into the house, so i hear a "uhh hello...??" and i got all embarrassed, and not he wasnt hot.   I dont know danny, but he fits..yea...my list..haha and i mean, thats a rockin list..haha :D so i want things to work out, at least meet the guy.   My mom, grandma and granddad called me this morning, it was great to talk to them, but i was basically asleep. lol   I'm gonna miss not talkin to lauren when she goes to montreat this sunday!! :(( BOOO HOOO!! haha i'll give her a call on her cell!   I wanna get my haircut like Robin off The Real World (my fave show of over 6 yrs) but not how she has it flat in the show, but how she has it on the website. And i was like thinkin of how it would look and u know what...it would look like that girl off of Made who wanted to be a skater..and u know what..i like skaters...haha WELL the weidest things just happen to me!! haha   Oh and 8-ball said " u may rely on it" to "will danny break up with his gf for me" LMAO. hey hey hey, 8 balls never lie "will lauren get her guy like on the list i made for her?"--"most likely" THERE YA GO LAUREN!  *much love*
