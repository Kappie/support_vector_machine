Then you could go off and be bunnies together.  "  Wow it's amazing how ignorant a person can be. I mean you give all you got and yet they still dont appreciate it. Yes I'm talking about him again. I hate him... I tried to be cool, but a person can only listen to these things for so long before they kill someone. Ya well carm and ry came over my house on Monday. My mom wouldnt let me go out so we just chilled outside. So for some reason, i think it's better if I hear what the dickwad says about me for myself. It's not that i dont believe carm, I do, I kno she wouldnt lie to me. I just have to hear it for myself to let it sink in. So we 3-way him, and i mute my phone so he cant hear me. wow was not ready for that one. No one has ever said such bad things about me. It really hurt. Some one who you gave your self up to is now calling you a psycho bitch. It hits ya hard. So I'm listening. And i realize I'm a fucking moron. Yup i said it. Everyone was right... I'm stupid. I mean i think the reason this happened is because we were jagged about it. Oh becca you want him. Oh dickwad you want her. You guys should JUST bone. I love the just in that. Like its giving someone a high five or something. JUST do it. Ya fuck off nike... no one wants to just do anything! So after ppl nag for so long it'll happened. But thats not what hurts. It hurts that he doesnt care at all... carm was talking to him and was like well why did u do it but not talk to her afterward. and he said... well she has a nice body, and you wanna talk to her but when you go talk to her your just like shut up!... I'm an annoying lil 5 year old, followed by a psycho bitch... OH and the best part... I'm conceited... YUP me... conceited... I'm soo hott, everyone wants me... blahbalhabh... .you kno what.... suck my right one. I'm not conceited... I'm NOT insecure w/ my body... I'm not in love w/ you. I'll let you kno that im not waiting for you, that i could be w/ someone else, I'm insecure w/ you and what you'll say about my body, and I dont have feeling for you. It hurts to see him care sooo much about my best friend, and not care if i dropped off the face of the earth. but whatev. I've learned what guys want, what they see, what they need. and i hope they are deprived of all of it. But not all guys are bad. There are a select few who i like, and trust. An that night i ended up calling an ex. just to see if they're all the same... I realized soon that this was one of the guys i liked. One that i could trust, and no matter how much of an asshole he acts, that i could go to him w/ a problem. This was the only thing that got me out of my mood that night. I appreciate it.    then last nightmatt calls meto go for icecream and im like surre not like i haveanything else in my life. So we leave and pj calls... so we stop up pj's. and they're doing cars... boys and their cars idont understand it. Anywayz... we get carm and we get icecream and i call my mom tolet her kno i may not be home on time... and she startsflipping out on me!... so i get home... SIX (6) FUCKING MINUTES LATE.... 6 minutes... and she grounds me.... wtf. She acts like im so trouble kid who does drug andhas six kids..... she is so highed up off a power trip its unreal.... she thinks justbecauseshe has slight rule over me that shecan take over my life....arrggg... shewouldnt even let me explain... she makes me soo mad... i dunno how long im grounded or anything... I'm suppose to go to the club tonight w/ carm,ry and joe... if she doesnt let me go then,,, i'll just kill myself....ITS ALL MATT'S FAULT...BOYS AND CARS.... BOYS ARE BAD, BOYS=DEATH...yup my conclusion on life! Ok .... AHHHHEHHHHH   so then this morning i wake up cuz i gotta go to work. and usual my dad rides me and we were just talking about this the other morning.... i get up and go in his room and hes sleeping, its like 9 and he's sleeping and no one tells me this. So i had to take a bus to work, i had no idea waht time it was coming or anything, so im rushing around like a mental person and the dog if barking at fake food, and ahhh it was a mess... but i get to work and it got a lil better... the ppl i work w/ are real cool, and we just goof off all day. PLUS IT WAS PAYDAY!!! YAYAY! 200some... i was syked!... im going shopping. but thats enough ranting for the day... PEACE.
