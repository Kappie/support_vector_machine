Yodels and hopefully Sheep (we still need to ask her) and I have started a blog with links to virtual pets sites and stuffs like that.. um.. link in sidebar. *point* Needs work, but uh.. fun? ^^  And Azumanga Daioh is so amusing, I can't even begin.. watch it! NOOOOOWWW! *flail*  And, uh, stuff. I'm bored. vv;; Nobody on CC, nobody on AIM, waaaah!  *thunk*
