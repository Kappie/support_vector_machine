What’s the hurry about? You better cool it off, before you burn it out You got so much to do, but only so many hours in a day But you know that when the truth is told, That you can get what you want or you can just get old Your gonna kick off before you even get half way through When will you realize, Vennia waits for you  Slow down  Your doin fine You can’t be everything you wanna be before your time Although it’s so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight To bad that is the life you lead You’re so ahead of your self that you forget what you need Though you can see when your wrong, you can’t always see when your right You got your passion, you got your pride But don’t you know that only fools are satisfied Dream on! But don’t imagine they’ll all come true When will you realize, Vennia waits for you  Slow down  You crazy child And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile It’s alright. You can afford to lose a day or two When will you realize, Vennia waits for you. That u can get what you want or you can just get old Your gonna kick off before you even get half way through When will you realize, Vennia waits for you Why don’t you realize, Vennia waits for you When will you realize, Vennia waits for you
