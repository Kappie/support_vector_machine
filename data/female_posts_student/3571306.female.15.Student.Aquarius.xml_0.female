Strange how life progresses. Life's like the Gravitron. I'm too scared to go on it, and I'm always left outside, looking in. Watching people strapped in, along for the ride while I see them spinning around in a swirling mass of colour. The people inside are the risk-takers. They're willing to grab life by the horns (sorry for the cliche) and be whipped in every direction. No matter how many times they're hurt, they still hold on with everthing they've got. It's scary how fast we age, yet we never really ask why it happens so fast. It just..happens. What is age anyway? You can't feel it, you can't see it, but it's always with you. Kinda like air. It makes you live everyday, makes you strive to achieve anything you want. There's so much we need to know and learn in such a small amount of time. Seeing my brother graduating makes me think about this a little more than I have before. Think about it, we're expected to be married and starting a family by the age of 30. That's only another 15 years away, tops. My first 15 went by quickly, another 15 will come up just as fast. Who knows what things we'll gain or lose by then? Do you actually know what you're life's going to be like later on? No, you don't and you won't until then, but you can steer it in the right direction. Just by observing people, you can tell if they're steering themself in the right direction, and people my age, aren't. It's ironic really. The people that need the most help, don't want to ask for it and don't take things seriously, but the ones that don't need the help, think they need it. Only a few people are smart enough to turn their lives around, but sometimes they figure it out too late. *Sigh* So many things to think about, too many things to ponder, only in one lifetime do you recieve your opportunities.
