Anyways, Sir Faizal kept doing silly stunts while bowling yesterday. mind if ya break ya finger dude!! haha..some crazy spins, but some worked out well. hyper-active as usual..hehe. as fer' me..i can't bowl for nuts!! i'm not good at it. it's really weird though..when i'm playing for someone else, in this case for pinky, i strike sia(by luck)!!   Daddy brought mommy and i to the club for a swim after breakfast. i got sick of swimming after swimming for several laps, so i went tanning and fell asleep. fortunately, it wasn't very sunny. i would've gone kayaking today with sis cherryn if she allowed me to tagged along..but she and her junior were gonna practice their 3 star skills, i guess for another expedition? yes, so some other day, she says. serene has gone to the movies with her mates... and mika, exams! geeesh, that poor girl!  but  we're gonna have dinner outside tonight to celebrate her 20th birthday..hopefully she'll just let loose and have fun with us! *muakz!* i love you sissa!
