One of the things I dig about her is her inability to go simple, small, understated.    When it appeared I needed a new dresser, bed-side tables, etc. in junior high, she decided I needed a full bedroom set of the finest quality, you know, to have when I move out and get my own house.    When I got my apartment, I planned to fill it with cheap, tacky furniture I could throw away at the end of my tenure, and shopped accordingly before the parents arrived to help in the venture.  By the time they left, I had a brand new table, futon and desk, because really, this was to be my home for (at least) the next two years.    When I asked for a DVD player for Christmas a couple of years ago, she decided I needed a 5-disc changer with 5 speakers and a subwoofer, you know, to have when I get my own house.  She stresses about vacations especially well.  Take an email conversation from this morning:  From: Cheryl    Sent:  Wednesday, June 16, 2004 9:07 am  To:  Andrea  Subject:  How does Mexico sound?
