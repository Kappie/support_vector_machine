Anywho, I had some totally insane dreams last night. It's wierd, cuz I always have wicked dreams when I eat pickles and/or chocolate ice cream b4 I go to bed. Funny hey?? Yeah...there was a lot of climbing up stairs, conversing with nuns, smashing glass, and maniacal laughter going on. I went into my dream dictionary and looked all that stuff up and it told me that I need to control that temper of mine, that I will soon go thru a trying period of my life, and that love life is going to improve. Bullshit. K, I refuse to get depressed again...I think I'll sleep away another day. (lol!)
