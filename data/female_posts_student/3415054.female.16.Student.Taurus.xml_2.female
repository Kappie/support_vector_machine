But OMGSSH!! while we were up there there was a TON of black kids n their moms swimmin n bein loud as most nuggets are n this lady who lives across teh street was like can I see yalls tag.. which u have to have to swim up there so people that dont pay dont swim.. n they started sayin  how it was discrimination n how they get picked on everytime while tehy are down there.. well hm yes. u will wen u have halfa africa down there... so they started yellin at each other n Nathan was like swimmin over there n I was like come back kid. n then he decided he wanted to go.. n me n lyndsey were like hush.. were stayin to listen to this.. so that went on for like 20 min.. but yea.. it was such excitement! So we came back here n cleaned up n I got ready to babysit.. Then at like 6 Wayne showed up and I went up to my moms work n talked to some of the chics up there n her boss was like gosh ashley u make me want a daughter.. n my mom was like shes for rent.. *gasp*.. but yea.. Taras really cool n her kids really like me.. shes got a 2 year old n a 4 year old.. They are one pretty black family.. lol. So we left there at like 645 n drove to where I was sposed to babysit.. n I did till like 1130.. They want me to baby sit their 4 girls for mosta the summer so she can work.. moneys kinda tight for them.. so I said I wouldnt mind.. I mean she said I could take the baby wen the other kids are w/ their dads for the weekend w/ me n go do w/e. n Sophies a really good baby n shes sooo cute.. so I might just do that since me n Justin usually hang out on weekends .. so im not sure.. well see.  Today..  I woke up n did NOTHIN... I have sat here n done NOTHIN! Its been sooo borin... Ive talked to Justin a lil bit but other tahn that its been mainly me n my brother.. cuz he decided to fall asleep wen Michelle was comin over w/ her kids so we couldnt go up to the pool.. oh well.. Im kinda burned from yesterday.. So we decided to just got tomorrow.  Well. Im like listenin to Kenny Chesney. when I think bout Leavin.. yeah.. strikes a lil too close to home. Its like sometimes I wonder wat would happend if I ever left him wen he does somethin stupid that annoys me like loses his licenese.. but then I think bout how much I would be losin.. an awesome guy whos totally in love w/ me.. his family is AWESOME... Gosh. I love his lil sister so much.. shes like my own lil sister.. His moms not bad either.. I kno they have a strong past but I wouldnt mind chillin w/ her a lil more.. she seems really cool... like she got all pumped up bout prom n she likes to make stuff for me.. Its acutally really sweet n Justins like weird round her so Im not sure. I would actually like to see em to be closer cuz it is his mom.. the one who brought him nto the world. I mean sure she might not have been the greatest mom.. sure she mighta been a whore.. but she loved him enough to take care of him wen she was only 18. so who knos.. but Ima go clean up my room.. so Ill catch yall crazy fools later.. mwah!
