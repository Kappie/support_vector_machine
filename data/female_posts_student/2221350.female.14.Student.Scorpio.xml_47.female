Is it just me or is she a little too OBSESSED with this INTERNET RESTRICTION thing. It wouldn't have hurt anyone to leave it on there so the rest of the songs((i.e. the ones that had no sources at 4AM i.e. most of them)) could finish downloading. I guess I should be glad she let me have it at all, but sometimes I wonder if maybe she should have some kind of life outside of fixing the computer so that I can't do things I want to regardless of if it hurts anyone or not. We're not talking porn here, we're talking music, food for the soul!  My buddylist is unusually empty, I suppose everyone is sleeping late because they partied all night. I'm sure I'll be hearing all about lauren's wild new years with people older than her ((OOH)) and maybe even a wine cooler ((DOUBLE OOH)). Honestly I don't understand peoples weirdness around alcohol, which is probably a good thing since I won't ever feel like I have to. My mom has never done that whole it's bad it's bad it's bad thing, and I appreciate that. She also said if there was a drug I wanted to try let her give it to me, which I'm sure if I ever expound on that offer you'll know about it.   I think I just used expound incorrectly. I'm constantly looking up words in the AOL dictionary because I think I would feel supremely stupid if I ever misused a word in conversation.
