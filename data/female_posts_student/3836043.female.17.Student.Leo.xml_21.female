An unknown catastrophe caused  the loss of the following family members Gold Koi, the Koi Twins, Lg Orange Comet, and Smaller Orange Comet. Two of the family members could be seen swimming, the other two are still missing at this time.   The burial was attended by Sam Girl  Brain Pan who were visibly mournful but reserved. Daisy Mae  Roscoe P were grazing in the distance seeming to not pay attention but reverent.   The memorial service is to be held this evening at the pond.
