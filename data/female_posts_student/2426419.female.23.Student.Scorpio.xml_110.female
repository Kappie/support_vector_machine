Sometimes she would just start laughing for no reason, and her laughter was totally contagious.  There were several times when I laughed so hard that I cried.  That is such a great feeling.  I really think it must be good for the soul or something.  I don't think we do that often enough.  I think we need to find something to make us laugh like like every day.  Maybe it would make us live longer.  Or we could just call Kenda at around 9:00 every night.
