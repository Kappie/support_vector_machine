Wow, it seem like just yesterday...!    Man, this [summer/winter/autumn/spring/month/day/week] has really flown!        Then I think about how old I am  how I feel more like the age I look than the age I really am {most recent comment was that I look 17!}.  :)   I realize now that I have stories.  I mean, I always, or have long appreciated that people, all people, have stories, have interesting lives  histories to be honored  told -- exactly why I try to appreciated people, even if they strike me as a bit annoying or pedantic at first glance.  But, I'd begun to give up on being a writer or began to think I could only write by first studying about it  learning different impressions  strategies for deteriming  creating good writing.  But, like the running website I looked at that said the best advice for new runners is to just get out there  run -- just do it {yikes! unintentional advertising slogan implemented -- am I so inundated by the media that I can't marinate an orignal thought? :) }  So, to be a runner, one needs to run -- and I'm thinking, now, the same goes for writing -- I just need to do it, let it flow.
