It was not, I repeat, WAS NOT, my fault. I was about halfway down the stairs, and the heel of my shoe came of. Luckily nothing was broken, but it hurt. Now I have major carpet burn, a scratch on my arm, and I was humiliated in front of my closest friend! (Not that I haven't been before, but c'mon, this was pretty bad.) I was glad that I didn't end up like I did the last time I fell down those same steps. I ended up with a bloody nose, and school the next day. Talk about something that sucked.    I also have a head cold. A head cold in the summer. Do you know how much that sucks? I'm bored, with nothing to do, besides try to figure out ways to breath through my nose when I sleep, so I don't wake up ever ten minutes because my mouth is dry.           Life sucks royal dick.
