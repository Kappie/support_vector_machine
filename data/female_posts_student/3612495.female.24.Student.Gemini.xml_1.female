But now, all the things had settled and my first exam in Australia is nearly come.  By the times, I am missing Hong Kong very much, my family, my friends and my students. Their faces always appear in my brain, I want to go back to meet them as soon as possible.   不知不覺在了悉尼已經4個月了。還記得當我第一天來到的時候，心裡又興奮、緊張，但又帶點慌忙，真的有點不知怎樣好。但幸好，現在所有的東西都已經安頓好，而我亦都投入了澳洲的生活，還有下星期便是我在澳洲的第一個考試，希望平平穩穩的便可以。  話雖如此，我還得掛住香港的每一個人，我的屋企人，我的朋友，還有我的學生。你們的樣子常常在我的腦海中浮現，真的好想快點飛返香港探你們。等，好快就可以見到你們的。
