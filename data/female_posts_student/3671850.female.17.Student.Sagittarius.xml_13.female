Went to school, went to Jessica's house (refer to Jess's blog), and came home to work on homework and play with Morgan. Because my friends have summarized my life in their own blogs, listen to this dream that I had last night. I'm open for  interpretations :   Okay, Jessica, a mystery man (i think was Blake), Dustin E, and I were all at my house looking at this hill, in the sky, at a trailor park and huge, beautiful house. I get the idea that it would be absolutely wonderful to go to that house (I'm assuming was Dustin's) and look through binoculars to see if I could see my own house... so we go. Then we are all in this restaurant... a mix between CiCi's Pizza and a cafeteria. Well I get to the end of the line and I have no food on my plate, and the lunch lady says: "get whatever u want, i'll take care of it." Then I reply: "No, I have the money, but I just don't know what I want." Then Donna (Nik's mom) who is standing in front of me says: "They have this chicken." I agree and take the chicken. I go to the drink machine, fill up my drink and begin to eat. After we are finished eating the manager of the restaurant comes to sit down in our booth. Note: Chad has now joined my dream. The manager says that we owe him some money because Chad got the orange drink and that is more expensive than the others. While Chad looks confused, I tell the manager that I am NOT paying him more money because there were no signs that said that the orange drink was more than any of the others. Then the manager gets angry and I tell him that he will just have to call the cops... Then I leave. Well, then I drive back to this big house, use the bathroom, and then Dustin tells me that the manager is here and I need to crawl through the window and run from him.... So, then, I decide to just confront him. I go outside and both my car and the manager's car is gone. I ran into the woods, very afraid, and I hear this car coming down the road.... so I face dive into the woods and lay very very very very still... and i woke up...   That is the strangest dream that I have  ever  had. Things that i recognize: 1) You can see a trailor park on a hill from my house. 2) Jessica and Blake have come to my house. 3) I have eaten at both CiCi's Pizza and the school cafeteria recently... and I do eat with Donna a lot on Sundays... and I did fill up mine and Jessica's drinks at CiCi's. 4) Chad's things are usually more expensive, lol. 5) The manager of the bowling alley told us that she was calling the cops on us. 6) I ALWAYS have to use the bathroom. 7) There are woods all around my house. 8) Dustin probably would freak out and tell me to jump through a bathroom window... lol, jk.  *Please help me I'm utterly confused... (I apoligize for any spelling problems :)) My song of the day is: I'm too busy/tired/lazy to look up lyrics... I can't WAIT until  Friday !
