First day of the Tri is always boring.  Thank god this is the last tri of the year, i don't know how much i could take.  I've decided that this tri, i'm not going to procrastinate and put things off as much as i did last tri.  I'm going to work so i can feel satisfied with myself.....no, actually, i just want all A's.    Lunch is awesome this tri because me and Brittnee have lunch together for the first time EVER!!!!!  yaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!  And Lauren, Nathaniel, Taylor (stewart), Lindsay, and Katie all have my lunch!!!!  its going to be a party lunch for sure.  Here's the best part.  THE BLONDE KID WITH NO FASHION SENSE IS IN MY LUNCH!!!!!  yaaaaaaaaaay!!!!  So that article of my blog lives on and i know you all enjoy it, lol.  Today he wore my favorite blue shirt with the white letters on it that looks soooo good on him.  Why is this my favorite? C'mon, the kid only wears 5 shirts a week and they're the same every week, so i can have a favorite.  Of course he had to ruin it with the ugly tan jacket, but thats cool.  Tomorrow me and Lauren are going to the store to inspect who all is in our lunch.    I met this girl named Rachna in my BCIS class this tri, she's really funny.  But she'll never replace my Kate McAdams!!!!  Kaler, Ashley and Hayem are in my class also.  Its the great reunion of Kaler and Taylor!!!!!  It'll be so awesome, we'll reminisce on all the good times in PreAp biology last year!  Mr. Allen doesn't like us already because we talk across the room.  Oh well.  It'll be an awesome class.  lalalalalalala i have nothing else to write.......because nothing really happened today  Best of luck with the new tri, ~~~Taylor~~~
