I've been kind of sick the past few days. Yesterday was the worst. i had a fever and I was seriously like...seeing things. It was no good. Not to mention I was coughing a lot and couldn't breathe through m,y nose. I've still got the cough but my nose is starting to clear up and my fever's gone. Whoo! Bryan's really sick too. I'm worried about him. He has like, a really bad stomach flu or something. I hope he feels better really soon. The stomach flu, to me, is like, the worst out of any flu. I hate throwing up. It's terrible. Anyway, heh, the section leader meeting Monday was alright. We just talked about how we can improve stuff next year and we're actually getting the music soon! YES! Wow, I'm such a loser.   Anyway, tomorrow wont be any fun since I have to work from 4-9 and then Friday I have to babysit from 4 until whenever they get home which, hopefully, wont be too late. This weekend should be cool though. Mother's day...I'm esdited. My brother's coming home so we're all going to hang out. I actually sort of miss him. I know that's weird but, I don't know. It's weird not having him around all the time. Plus, I get along with him so much better now. Probably because he's not around 24/7. Saturday night, I'm hoping to do something with someone. I get off work at 7:00 so, that's pretty nice. I have some of my Saturday night left.   And, I did find out. Haha, we are going to prom but yeah....the group situation's kinda messed up right now. I don't know. This might be really weird. Who knows? I guess I'll find out. It can;t be all that bad though. At least I get to dress up!! I hope Nathan has a tux... oh dear....hah, I can tell next week's going to be hectic.   I'm outta here. I'm going to bed really early because, although my fever's down, I'm still not feeling great.
