First problem: Bro is in hospital for a long long time liao...only to be discharged on thursday and will come back painfully with a hole in his abdomen where he has to pluck the dialysis machine every night. It is damn sick and pain, and all the more i wanna run away and hide and not see the pain he's going through. When will transplant begin? It'll take very long for a new organ...am i too young? too small? Why can't i do anything to help? Why am i IGNORED?  Second problem: Loneliness has been part of my life ever so long. It has become my friend, my confidante in time of need, which is now. Everyone is caring about him, and that's precisely wat my bro needs now, but somehow i am left out. Some ppl say it's because my parents dun wanna see me hurt. But it's killing me anyhow, which ever way u put it. Sigh.  Third problem: Wat's with J and me? Where am i heading to? Accompanying him, practising every fri for his practical exam? Am i really truly only just friends with him? Can't i face the fact that nothing will ever work out? I'm really messed up...one moment i think we're just good friends, but the nxt moment i know not wat i think...  Fourth problem: It's raining everyday and i haf no idea of this melancholy i feel. It plagues me like a disease. I try not to think so much but it doesn't help at all.  Wat can i say? HaiZ...
