Find out @  urlLink She's Crafty    You're upbeat, insightful, effervescent and imaginative.   Sometimes a little too imaginative... You're all about the subtext, about what's going on between the lines. You very rarely take anything at face-value.   You also have a tendancy to be a little neurotic and self-absorbed, and fall for guys who are either (for the most part) emotionally unattainable or completely wrong for you.   That's okay, though, everyone loves you anyway. You're very well-liked. You always have a shoulder for your friends to cry on or an ear for them to gossip in. High-profile and fun, you're the life of the party.   Carrie quotes:  "You can't make friends with a squirrel. Squirrels are just rats with cuter outfits."   "I'm thinking balls are to men, what purses are to women. It's just a little bag but we'd feel naked in public without it."   "The only thing I've ever successfully made in the kitchen is a mess. And several small fires."
