Any way, well first scary thing... these people that we knew were like hiding in the bushes! (Ok then) And then they came and *stood by us* at the exact same moment that me and Izzy had decided to go for a run... so we ran away and for some other reason every one followed us! Then when we got back they were still standing by people talking in their own little group! So we had two seperate groups even though they were standing by us... ok then... then they walked off. Other scary thing: Jon kind of coughed some thing about will you go out with me or some thing and I'm quite scared! Why is it that if you get close to some one they think that you like them like them? I think I've been through all this stuff before on blogger, yup, definatly! Grr, I forgot to get Emily a card! :'( Whoopsie, but I always do! Yeah I never get any one a card. Unless they kick me and tell me to remember to. Sorry, got nothing inside my head at the moment, it's one of those days. Otherwise known as a klutzathon!
