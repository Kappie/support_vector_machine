 i'm a smart girl, but i have no idea how a magnet can see my brain, and in such detail that i can look at the films and see the weird mushy, wormy looking texture and follow my optic nerve from eyeball to occipital lobe.  weirder still is that the magnet can see through my neck and shoulders to the cervical spine!  and if i were having the thoracic spine scanned, too, the magnet would see past my ribs and lungs and heart to my spinal cord!    all of these mechanical miracles, and yet i have an incurable disease...  the other thing i was thinking about, and this is definitely a result of the ativan and the oxygen, was what words the scans sounded like.  in a way, it was like being inside a kraftwerk song--robotic, evenly paced, nerdy, even a little scary.  my sister used to do this thing, before she got too teenagery, where she would say the word "girl" over and over into her fist, so that her lips were covered entirely.  the result was this weird see-and-say-esque noise that sounded like "doy".  i think this was some kind of bizarro thing that girls do at camp late at night in the cabins, high on junk food and independence.  but the MRI noises sounded a bit like that.  sometimes they sounded bleepy, like an old-school hand-held video game.  sometimes they sounded like someone was knocking from inside the machine.    but the words i was imagining, and at times i swear they were actually being spoken to me by the MRI (again, folks, i was under unusual chemical influence) were real words.  the MRI was talking to me.  now, in my normal and sober state, all i remember is that i was being spoken to.  i can only remember one series of words that were said--"this is it this is it this is it".  i figured this was what the machine was saying to me as it scanned the part of my brain that is swollen with my MS lesion.  am i losing my mind?  the answer could be yes--both literally and figuratively.  see earlier post--i don't feel much like myself.  and this was 10:something on a friday night and i'm going through this magnetized ridiculousness as, now, a matter of course, a part of my life, this thing that i do.    i got my contrast injection, had about fifteen more minutes of scans, and that was that.  i was awakened from my drug-induced near-euphoric slumber by a nurse telling me i did a great job (did a great job?  i didn't _do_ anything).  it was the equivalent to the house lights coming up after a concert performance--eyes readjusting to the light, stiffness from being still for so long--my philip glassian radiological procedure.    but that's not all, oh no.  that's not all.  i went to the dressing area to regain my pride and my clothing.  and then...  ...i swiped a hospital gown.  yes, i know--this is wrong.  it's stealing and whatnot.  i'm not going to try to justify my actions.  i stole a hospital gown.  but i really liked the print on the material, it gave me some ideas for sewing projects.  i mean, i've spent enough time in that hospital already and taking a gown off their hands isn't going to set them back too much.  they have about a million of them.  besides, i was high from breathing straight oxygen for 45 minutes.  it seemed like the best thing to do at the time.  your honor, i am guilty.  take it up with my insurance company.  not only was i high enough to stuff a gown in my bag, but also i decided that the best way to get home at 11:00 at night would be to walk.  i walked the 22 blocks, staggering like a drunk, talking on my cell phone.  but i made it home safely, was greeted by the dog and cats.  had some oreos for dinner.  fell right asleep.
