BUT, it wasn't really his house (i've gone over there b4 to see him and I used to babysit the kid who lived there before him), it was WAY bigger and super, uber pretty. it was a 2 story, too. anyway, these 2 little 10 year old kids, who claimed that they were my cousins, were with us and i asked them if anyone was home. They said, of course someone's home, and so we tried to sneak out, meike. we were halfway down the street when we heard the kids and frankie and his sister and mom and dad yelling and running after us. so, we took off at a sprint and they chased us around for, like, an hour, all around the neighborhood. finally, we thought we'd lost them, but when we were taking a breather, frankie runs up from behind me and then grabs a hold of my foot and refuses to let go. neither of us can stop laughing and finally, he pulls me close to him and hugs me then calls me "julie" which is the name of his ex-girlfriend in Texas, and when I looked at his face, it was really Colby, the (hot)guy who comes to stay with his mom and stepdad every summer across the street from me. then colby calls me "tania" which is one of my really good friends who used to live by me and moved away who had a HUGE crush on colby. i was still laughing and hugging him, though.  i don't know. what do you guys think it means?  am is super desperate to get a bf that i'll hook up with anyone and sneak into their houses?!?!   oh, and i think nate has a 'girlfriend', but when i say that, i mean that she thinks of nate as her boyfriend and nate thinks of her as an "ass to try and tap". i'm happy for...er....him, though. honestly. i don't know what came over me but when we drove by and they were hugging and kissing on eachother in the pool, I smiled, then realized what i was doing and tried to make myself stop, but i couldn't. i don't know. i've been wierd lately.  liebe, katja
