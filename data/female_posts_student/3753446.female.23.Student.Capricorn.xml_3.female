Although Donny (my good buddy and wedding date) and I were too late to see her walk down the aisle, it was still totally surreal to see her up there, in that dress, taking vows, exchanging rings, and being dubbed a Mrs. for the first time. I think I was in a trance or something for those few minutes, and all I could think about was, "Are we sitting on the wrong side of the chapel? Oh SHIT. We ARE sitting on the wrong side of the chapel. Do I know anyone on this side? What was the groom's name again? What if the bride sees me on the wrong side? I think I just ruined her wedding. Oh DAMN." Donny and I made it out alive though. We even ran into an old friend of Donny's named Steve who also sat on the wrong side of the chapel (opposite us). I really liked Steve. Total cutie and really passionate about what he does with his life. Really outdoorsy kinda guy too. The reception was really long, but having Steve and Donny there made it go by much faster. Add to that the five high school friends I ran into. Apparently I was sitting next to one in the chapel and we didn't even recognize eachother (OH NO we're that OLD! and OH NO, she knew about our faux pas!). Other people I ran into were my high school orchestra stand partner and one of my best friends' sisters. It was driving me crazy how much PDA there was going on among this particular group of people. Lots of fiances and spouses, and they were all really reeally clingy. I don't like that at all. It shows a total absence of trust when a woman is hanging onto her SO's arm for dear life, or lips for that matter. In any case, dinner was excellent and dancing followed. Donny and I didn't get to waltz but we did get to swing, which was a ton of fun. An electric slide and Casper's mix later, and we were out with our complimentary jars of honey as wedding gifts "Sarah and Matthew Stuck Together June 2004."   Now all I need is my own honey to be stuck to. Yeah that's exactly what I thought at the wedding. Weddings have a funny way of making you want to hook up, even if you are living a perfectly happy independent life. I think I'll get over it...
