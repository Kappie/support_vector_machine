I hate it how you see people that you NEVER EVER EVER talk to ususally and they get all friendly and call you "Megs". At BK (as if not enough funny htings happen at BK...) I was getting food and teh girl who was at the cash did not stop staring at me.. even when I looked at her back.. mom thought that was funny... I was thinking that mabey she was trying to read hte pins on my hat or something. Mabey not. Mabey there are more BK lesbians than the two me and Tiffany know.  I got home and went up the souwest nad it was broing hardly anyone was around and everyone was all sick and did not feel well so no one went swimming. Then we were told that someone called the cops on us since we were "blocking" the road. They heard it on the scanner. So we all left jsut because it would be simpler to leave than to stay and get told to move.. I need to think of a new name for Brittle Boy (jordan) since he doesn't like that name... LOSER!! lol jk  Then I watched 28 Days.. which i thought would be a really cool movie but it was really boring. I thought that there would be more action or something.. but their wasnt.
