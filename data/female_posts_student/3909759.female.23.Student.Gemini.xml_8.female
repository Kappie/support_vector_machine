Here is part of what I rambled on about: "You are on another plain of existence now, when you resurface from the caves two men in masks will greet you and they will take you to where you need to go..." The twenty minute piece has become infamous in our circle of friends, we've hyped it up, and when you join the circle of those that have been enlightened by it's powers, you may run very far away.    Basically, if we someday reach this point:  http://www.hugi.is/hahradi/bigboxes.php?box_id=51208=1075  things will be going fine.
