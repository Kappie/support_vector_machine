My room really isn't that large, but it is now 5.12 am and I just finished.   Note to self: stop saving crap and start getting rid of it!!!  Earlier I called the dude at 99x (can't think of the name, I'm not sure I can think right now, it's so late (or early?)) because he said to call him because no one was calling him and we had a nice and interesting conversation about my cleaning of the room and his being up since 8 am. It was good.  And do you know what the greatest thing about finally finding the right college will be?   To be able to freely toss out all the college mail that infests every mere corner of my room-- well, maybe not the corners, but any plain surface that enables me to say, "it's not on the floor!" Honestly, I've got shoeboxes and shoeboxes and stacks and stacks-- my telescope is buried under a massive stack of college mail, as is my vanity. Bahh.   So now I'm super ranting about nothing and I think I'm going to head to bed so I can get up, finish my laundry (how did I manage to wind up doing my sister's boyfriend laundry, too, I wonder? I feel like a mom), vacuum, and get crackin' on immense mounds of work...   Furthermore, I hate DST. This whole one less hour to sleep deal is going to throw me off in an overly disgusting fashion.    Oh, and there is now a thick, burgundy red streak in my hair.   "Brain Stew" by Green Day  I'm having trouble trying to sleep  I'm counting sheep but running out As time ticks by  And still I try  No rest for crosstops in my mind  On my own... here we go   My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed  Dried up and bulging out my skull My mouth is dry My face is numb  Fucked up and spun out in my room  On my own... here we go   My mind is set on overdrive  The clock is laughing in my face  A crooked spine  My sense dulled  Passed the point of delerium  On my own... here we go
