Yeah a few mindless chores here and there, swam in the pool/sunbathed, and generally had a relaxing day.  The week ahead is going to be pretty busy, but I figured it can all wait till Monday, right?  Ok, well that's about all I have to say today.  No new updates on anything really.  It's all a waiting game for now.  TTFN - Ta Ta For Now.
