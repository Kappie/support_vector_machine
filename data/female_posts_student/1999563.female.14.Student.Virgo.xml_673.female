Armen, 12, Mariam, 10, Artur, 3, and Maria, five months, are undernourished. They haven’t got money even for a minimum ration.  Sometimes Lida picks bones at a meat market. After boiling them she makes a "soup". It's the children's favourite meal. They call it "meat soup".     Lida uses plastic bags as a fuel for the stove. There are plenty of them in the marketplace. Burning plastic bags releases lots of smoke. Faces, curtains, clothes - everything is covered in soot.  Lida used to be a prostitute. Now she earns a little money buying cheap cigarettes at a border market and selling them locally. It's not enough.    Three-year-old Artur has a bath everyday. He has to wait his turn after his younger sister Maria. By the time he gets into the water it is lukewarm and dirty, but he enjoys it anyway. He can spend hours in the tub.  At the end he is not completely clean but at least some of the soot is gone.    Lida's mother, Asya, is 75. She lost her passport and she doesn't get any pension. Asya looks after Maria.  She feeds her, changes her nappies and does whatever she can to look after the baby.    Despite every effort the house is in a sorry condition. Dirt and soot covers everything. Older children don’t help Lida much. Little Artur thinks it's all a game. He doesn’t know any better.    Washing up is part of the everyday routine. The house doesn't have running water, so Lida brings water from a spring and does her washing outside.  Older children usually sit and watch her doing the washing. Clothes become more or less clean for a short period - and then get covered in soot again.     Lida's children don’t play with other kids. They don't go to school or out and about.  They avoid other people. But they often play together, are close to each other and look after little Maria in turns.   --------------  That is the saddest story I have ever heard in my life. The pictures.. wow.  I just makes me want to do something for these children...for their mother...for their grandmother.  It breaks my heart to see people in this condition. But, this is the fact of life for thousands of people all around the world.  Why then do we still buy 24 dollar shirts? 50 dollar jeans?  We could do so much with that money. Instead of purchasing some clothes we could feed a whole family for a month..  it just breaks me up inside.
