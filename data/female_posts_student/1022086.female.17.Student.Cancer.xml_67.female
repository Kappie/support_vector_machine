If you miss me incredibly and feel an urgent need to know how I'm doing, go to my deviantart site and read the journal there. I could just paste the contents here, but I'm too lazy.   Oh, and I'm too lazy to paste the URL, too, so just click on the link to the left over there on this page that says, "My Deviantart" (doh!)
