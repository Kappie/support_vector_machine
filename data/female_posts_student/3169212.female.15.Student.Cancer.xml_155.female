Buddha:  He's a bit indisposed at the moment.  Baka:  He still knocked out?  Buddha:  Yes.  Baka:  Do you think you might've hit him a bit too hard?  Buddha:  No.  Baka:  The rest of you must really hate Kuronue if you don't even comment about that sudden attack.  Buddha:  He had it coming.  Baka:  Yeah, but Gojyo is just like Kuronue and you don't do anything to him.  Buddha:  He's aiding in saving Shangri'la.  Kuronue, however, had no distinct purpose.  Kuronue:  Hey, I can hear you two!  Baka:  You're up.  Kuronue:  Yeah, yeah.  It's times like these I wish I was back in Makai.  Baka:  *sarcastically*  Oh, does poor Bat Boy want a cookie?  Kuronue:  You little bitch!  *chases Baka again*  Baka:  You'll never catch me!  Kuronue:  We'll see about that, you bastard!  Baka:  Swearing will get you nowhere.  Kuronue:  *pulls out scythe and throws*  Baka:  *too distracted by the scythe coming towards her, trips over her own feet*  Kuronue:  *stops running*  I didn't even hit her and she falls down; this is too pathetic for words.
