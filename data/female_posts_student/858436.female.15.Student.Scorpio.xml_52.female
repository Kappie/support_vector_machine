My tutor is working miracles haha. I got a 22/30 on my last quiz! It doesn't sound that great, but honestly, that's the highest I've gotten in a long time. Lol.  Um.. not much to say.. haha.  Things I Want at the Moment:  Rooney's CD This one skirt from Hollister.. A pair of Hollister jeans Bath and Body Works Pleasures lotion in Sweet Pea And can't forget the boy.. hehe.  Hm.. I still have a bunch of birthday and babysitting money left. Maybe I'll just ask for the lotion for Easter or something. Yeah okay I'm being way random..
