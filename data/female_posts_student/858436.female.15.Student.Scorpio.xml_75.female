Dad and Charles are in Baton Rouge. :-D  Speaking of dad, last night he was yelling like a madman about me not doing physics extra credit or doing the scholarship essay. Yeah that was a bunch of BS, since I HAVE been working on them and I turned the scholarship thing in today. He thinks it's due May 1st, so I just let him believe that. Plus, our computer is about to die and you can't even open up Word on it. So how the hell am I supposed to do all this? I've been doing it all at school, which is why he hasn't seen me working on it. So, being the SMART ONE he is, put an AOL timer up on my screen name and didn't tell me what time it's for and went down to Louisiana this morning. So.. genius, I can't work on the physics extra credit! *skies open up* WHAT A BRIGHT IDEA! MAYBE IF WE BLOCK MADELINE OFF HER AOL, SHE CAN'T GET ON TO "TALK TO HER FRIENDS"! BUT DID WE THINK ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO HOMEWORK? NAH OF COURSE NOT!  The stupidity! It truly amazes me. Virginia has been nice enough to let me get on her screen name to do homework and get on MSN. So HA!  Anywho.. enough of that. Lunch today was just a tad bit embarassing, but I'll live. That was by far the reddest my face has ever gotten! :-S Jack, you're toast.   I'm running for Sophomore Class President! So far it's just me and Ed running. If Abe and Brett sign up then I definitely won't win, but it's all good. I just did it on a whim for the heck of it. So vote for me! Haha.  Hm.. guess that's it!
