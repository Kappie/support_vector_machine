They just going to teach us what kind of possession we have over inanimate objects/land/other human beings?  What kind of sick twisted shit is THAT?"   As it turns out, it's actually quite interesting, complicated, frustrating, at-times incomprehensible, and an organizational nightmare that I'll have conquered very soon because I have no choice.   Recent topics organized/consolidated into outline (study-able) form:  Future Interests :  Retained by transferor : a.Reversion: when the quantum of the estate given is less than whole, retained by grantor b.Possibility of reverter c.Right of reentry   Retained by transferee : a.Vested remainder b.Contingent remainder c.Executory interest   Remainder : any future interest created in a transferee that can (IS CAPABLE OF) become a present possessory interest immediately upon (BUT NO SOONER THAN) the expiration of prior interests simultaneously created and which cannot divest (cut short) any interest other than the future interest in the transferor.  Vested Remainder : receiving party is presently identified and known (ascertained at the time), and only natural expiration of all prior estates created with it is needed for it to become possessory; itâ€™s NOT subject to any condition precedent  Contingent Remainder : identity of receiving party unknown and  interest is subject to a condition precedent, something must happen before the interest vests other than the natural expiration of all prior estates   Sigh...  Life is good...
