N wells, the ting tt I dread 4 came true. I've gt her 4 oral! I was lyk thinking, "Oh my gud! How m I gonna survive?". But she was veri friendly to me. Which made me less nervous. But nevertheless, she is a strict teacher! Heard tt from Ixora gurls. Damn fierce.. But veri nice to Hibiscus gurls (My class!) when we go dere for moral ed. Mayb she was juz acting.. Hu noes?
