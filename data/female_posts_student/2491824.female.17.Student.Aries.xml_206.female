I -- finally! -- got my learner's permit again...  I must say that the picture of me on it looks great...  I know that sounds conceited, but I think it's one of the best pictures ever taken of me.. (That seems kinda sad...)  I have a quartet of terrible canker sores.. Ugh..   That's all... You can go about your business now...
