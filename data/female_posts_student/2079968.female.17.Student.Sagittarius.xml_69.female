My TEETH even hurt, it's so bad...  Reminders to me for next time's post: -Talk about the "special guests" at school. -Post classification paper because it's awesome. -Talk about drama commercials because they were awesome.  Did I just say "awesome"? You betcha. *wink wink to HM fans*  Oh, TGTIF (Thank Goodness Tomorrow Is Friday).
