I think I can come to the BBQ but only for a couple hours as it is A-level day so I tink have to be home for dinner or something. I dunno. I'll see. Jackie, perhaps I can come to your house first or knock for you as I go up to Darrens? Or will you be there early to help him set up? My next few days are as follows: Tomorrow: A-Level result day so going to park to meet James to find out what he got at AS Level. Then Daz's bbq. Friday: Can't remember. Probably nothing. Saturday: Nowt. Sunday: Nowt.  Wooooooooooo!
