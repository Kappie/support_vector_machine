(i get really corny when m cheesy... haha.. i dnt think that made sense) anyways...  hmm.. at last i already got what i need from ust already... hehe.. I'M SO HAPPY!!!! the long trips from katipunan to espana: HISTORY!!! (i hope)  sayang.. i wasn't able to hang out with some of my blockmates... they were in sec b... near the lockers.. i'm not exactly sure what they did when i was gone.. but it seemed that they had fun.. well i'm happy for them.. i just wish i could have been there instead of being in ust.. tsk... ok lng.. nkahabol naman ako eh.. kahit sandali lang... (now they know how crazy i really am..) haha...  anyways.. i have to end this na... check out the monday mcdo crew's blog... i'll link it.. then just click it!! nyahaha.. ok.. that wasn't funny.. hehe..
