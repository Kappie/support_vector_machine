She said the dance magnet was really awesome cuz she saw them dance. I just kept thinkin i could do alla that stuff if i weren't moving. But one of the highschools i might go to has a VPA program but...I REALLY wanted DP. I mean i REALLY REALLY wanted DP. But...I guess you can't always get what you want, especially me. This really sucks. I'm still not convince that my life is worth living. I know its not good to think of bad things but i can't help it. Nothings going well for me right now. I have a D in math that im tryin to bring up. No one really cares so whats the point in telling you.    One good note:Yellowcard is playin at House of Blues April 11!!!! me and Francesca are going (me hopefully) I can't wait! Personally, I haven't really gone to rock concert b4. lol. I think it'll be so much FUN! I got they're cd Ocean Avenue and Its THE best cd i have. Like, everysong on that cd is my fav. lol   Well i kinda learned a song on the guitar! Behind Blue Eyes...its a great song. Its not even hard to play.   Lets see..in chorus Mrs.Brown made everyone audition for dancing in the spring concert. And yes, i was picked. Unfortunately i have to do lil corny dance steps lol like last year(for those who remember lol) But it'll be my time to goof off again and be stupid lol.    Speaking of chorus, MPA is coming up VERY soon lol. I mean i have rehearsals in the morning! We're singing To Be Young and Rise Up Singing. and guess what, the person who composed To Be Young,Dr.Brunner is coming to my school to my chorus class and is going to work with us! I really think its honor for him to come back to FLA. to just work with us.    But anyway, I guess im gonna go and see if Bills outside so i can talk to him. Toodles!
