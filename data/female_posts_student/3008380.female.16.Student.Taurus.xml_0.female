Then I went with Joel to the rec, out to eat, and to Secret Window, one frickin awesome movie. I love it! The only bad thing about my day...my mom got a new car. I should be excited and all, but she got a new car, and had to trade in our old one. So now we are back to having one car. I'm without. And since she got this new one, there's like no way I will be able to get one now. My 16th summer, where I will have a job, and yet I won't have a car. I guess I will have to save up and get a POS. Wonderful.
