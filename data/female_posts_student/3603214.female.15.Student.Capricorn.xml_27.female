Night Shayamalan *spelling?* so of course it's gonna be trippy! Red is the bad color...we must bury the bad color! WAHHHHHHH! lol.  I had a car wash earlier...it sucked major. Well...not really, but I didn't wanna go to it lol. I'm tannerish lol. So that gets cool points. Yesterday, Karen was like super evil n my mom was like why do you put up with that? I said I don't know anymore...go figure...h/o, must fetch my taquitos!...AH yummy.  Amber, what time are you goin to registration? Cuz I don't want to go alone n I'm tryin to figure out what time Mandy's goin too...Get back to me on that...  Lessons learned today: Jamie Cullum is the GREATEST. THE VILLAGE is the GREATEST. and Amy is the AMAZINGEST!
