Sini saw HIM and asked HIM to help me carry the files. HE READILY AGREED TO IT. ARGHX! i was so infuriated. because i just told Sini about HIM the day before and now she is like trying to make fun of me? i was so angry with her. i didn't talk to anyone until we reach the staffroom. but it is really sickening. why must HE keep on pestering me?! HE is like a thorn in my eye. i can't wait to get rid of HIM. HE doesn't seem to be able to get my hint. i have been very cold towards HIM and whenever HE is around, i'll give the very "buay song" look. furthermore recently i have been sitting in between my friends, not at the side, so that i can make sure HE is not around me.   but alas, HE is getting quite smart nowadays. HE always seemed to be able to predict where we are going to sit and will sit around that area. and yesterday during maths, when i sat beside kelly, HE was directly behind me, as usual. i purposely said loudly that i wanted to change seats with kelly because i have not done my tutorials. and the very next thing that happened. HE changed HIS seat as well. nearer to me. make me feel worse. and just now, HE smsed me asking me what time were we supposed to report. sometimes i wished i can muster up all my courage and screamed at HIM "STOP ALL THIS NONSENCE!!!! THIS IS ANNOYING AND U ARE MAKING VERY IRRITATED WITH YOU!!" but i can't. no matter what HE is still my classmate. i don't want to make things embarressing and awkward for the both of us. one and a half more years to go. but i really cannot stand HIM anymore. situation is getting out of hand. my goodness. HE is also one of the reason why i am getting pissed easily nowadays.  i don't what to do.  and today is yanting's birthday. i was surpised that the class actually remembered. we sang a birthday song for her at the canteen. it was weird. and after a while the guys left. if i was yanting i would have felt disappointed. the celebration lasted like only 10 mins? she looked happy. but somewhat i felt that she was just putting up a brave front. well, at least we celebrated her birthday. i hope that from now she will not feel so left-out.
