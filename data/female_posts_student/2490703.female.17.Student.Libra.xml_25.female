So he answers the phone and before he even says hello, I hear Andy Marr say "She's a bitch, tell her that's from Andy." then some girl laughed. I'm so upset. After he finally said hello, he was like can I call you back. I was like if you're lucky. I'm so mad! He told me we couldn't do anything today... Now I know it's so he can hang out with his other friends who are clearly more important than me. He's leaving me for the weekend then I'm LEAVING for college and I'm not going to be here to ignore! You know what's sad, Amanda said met a brother of a friend who is my age and I guess he's really cute. I just thought about calling the guy so I could piss Ryan off. AHHHHHH! I'm so mad, Kira I don't know what to do. I don't think I'm going to talk to him if he ever calls me back. I know that I'm not...I have to go so I can cry to myself in my room.  I love you like a sister.                                    Peace and Love,                                             Paris
