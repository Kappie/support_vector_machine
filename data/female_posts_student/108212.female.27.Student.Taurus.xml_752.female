I, of course, identified with the keyboard player, not just 'cos he played keys (like me), but also his name was Jay (like me) and he talked too much (like me).  Then they fired him midway through the movie.  I've been thrown out of a lot of bands, too.  Great movie, though - check it out if you get a chance.  Great band, too - I've got their latest CD, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, on heavy rotation.  Thx to Ching  Brian for the Hallowe'en pics - we couldn't get a sitter for Grandma and had to skip the one we were invited to, so we lived vicariously through yours...
