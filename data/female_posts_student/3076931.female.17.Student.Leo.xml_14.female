I don't know if this will be my last entry before i get back...i might update while i'm there.  I hope i have a good time. I'm excited but at the same time i'm not.  It should be a great learning experience. Wish me luck in India! I come back June 22! yay! E-mail me and stay in touch, homies! I love you all!
