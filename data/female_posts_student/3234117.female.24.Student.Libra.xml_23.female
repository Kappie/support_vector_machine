I would also definitely recommend seeing it at the Angelika.  How perfect is it to have a meal prepared to take into the theater with you?  On the downside, I wasn't able to eat their popcorn, but I did have a very good cheeseburger!  I would also recommend going to the Angelika as I just found out today, on a Tuesday.  Tuesdays are great if you have your student ID because for 5.50 you get a ticket and a free popcorn!  Had I known this sooner I would've been there every Tuesday!  Check out what's  urlLink playing , they have a lot of good films.
