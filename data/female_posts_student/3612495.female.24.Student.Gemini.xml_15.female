Also his grandpa and his grandpa's gf had came from New Zealand to Australia for few days, so we had dinner at his house and went to the club with them.  在7月2日終於考完試啦，而且在這數天，Gavin都在我的家，因為他有5天的大假。還有他的爺爺及他爺爺的女朋友從新西蘭來了澳洲旅行，所以Gavin的媽咪叫我去他屋企食飯及去同他們去club。  03 July 2004 And last Saturday night, when we back from Padstow, while Gavin was looking out from my bedroom's window, he saw a fire happened in the house opposite to the road, and at that time, I am talking with my mum on phone, then Gavin quickly rang "000" for the fire station. It happened in the kitchen of that house while a girl is cooking the chips. After a while, there had an explorsion from the window, then the fire to the roof, horrible. After that, I called mum back and told her what had happening, she asked me to take extra care. Luckily, Gavin was here with me, otherwise, I dont know what I can do.  在星期六，在Gavin屋企食完晚飯回到我家，當我正當同我媽咪傾緊長途電話，Gavin望出街見到對面街有間屋火燭，他立時跑到樓下及打"000"。原來係有個女仔在廚房煮薯條引至起火。過了一會，便聽到爆炸聲，跟著在屋頂也可以見到火，好慘。之後，我再打返電話俾媽咪告知她，她叫我小心點兒。在那一刻，幸好Gavin，不是的話我都唔知點算好。
