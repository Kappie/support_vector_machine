I was wondering if yall (yes, even you, Abby, even though you don't go to BHS.  You're my best friend and I need help!) can come over one day (before April 23!) and help me make 8 posters and 2 8-foot banners to campaign.  I also need help convincing people to vote for me- just to get the word out there. Please please please help me.  I really want to win this election, but I need yall's help to do it!!!  Let me know ASAP.
