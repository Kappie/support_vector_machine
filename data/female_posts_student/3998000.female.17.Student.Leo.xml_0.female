Its quite an interesting mix when you feel all of your muscles screaming for a time out but your mind and heart just won't have it. Sigh... oh well, life goes on.   I would like to apologize for the last post. Normally I am not that pathetically metaphorical but when nothing happens in my life, I start to think about life and what it means. And because life is such a huge topic for a nieve mind such as mine to comprehend, I must talk in metaphors. I promise I will steer clear of metaphors tonight though, today was somewhat interesting.   I finally got my long awaited school housing information and my roomie is just who I wanted it to be! YAY!!!!! S.U.- WATCH OUT... I'M ON MY WAY!!! I don't know what else to say than "I'm Mega Pumped!" and I thought I'd never say that in my life, how embarrassing. So I got put in a Split Double which, as most of you college bound students out there know, means that there will be a wall between me and my favorite person ever. BUT asI was thinking about it, and as my father pointed out so bluntly, when we decide to bring boyfriends back to the room... things won't get as weird. Upon hearing this my mother decided that it might have been a better idea to request an Open Double. HAHA! Yeah, OK Mom.   This split double business will come especially in handy when someone comes up to visit during the upcoming seasons for some skiing/snowboarding. AHEM and to see his favorite "pazza femmina". Damn bastard had to go to Fire Island tonight to get drunk with his buddies. "I wish you could come too"... "Yeah ok,right up until it means I have to cover for you, right?" LoL! How can someone drive you so crazy and then make you smile so much? :) "Have a great time tomorrow night!"... "I'll try. It would be better if you were there though." A smiley face needs to be created that gives off the impression of someone feeling all special inside, tehehe.   Well I think pretty soon my body is just going to shut down and refuse to work, so I am off to collapse on my bed. Which, now that I've read about my day, shouldn't be that necessary but oh well. To each his own, right?        Buona notte.
