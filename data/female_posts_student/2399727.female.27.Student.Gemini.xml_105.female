Unsure about where they'll take me next. ***** Found out a few things today.  There's a bursary offered by a couple of religious groups at St. Pete's.  Suspect it is only for St. Pete's, but I gave a brief sob story and asked if it can be used at St. Mike's and if not, if they know of similar external funding.  We'll see.  No work-study; that program was cancelled years ago. ***** Anonymously asked if TST students can live in this residence.  Got an affirmative response.  Hopefully once they find out it's me the rules won't change :-)  Good thing, because that available room from yesterday turned out not to be so available today. ***** Returned D's book and sent him an email to thank him for everything.  Wonder if he'll reply? ***** Might meet with Marilyn next week again.  She is so biased it's hard to know if I'm just caught up in her energy and hopes for me.  Told her I might drop by just to freak out. ***** Sponsor is on holidays until two days before I'm supposed to start my placement.  Called the mediators and missed their return call while I was at Mass.  (D. was celebrant -- always is on Tuesdays.)  Called them back, left voicemail.  No return call. ***** Dad's surgery rescheduled to May 7.  Glad I can be home for that. ***** Looking forward to  Rancho Relaxo .  Two of us have surmised that that was the name of a cheesy resort on The Simpsons.  This should be interesting. ***** More to come...
