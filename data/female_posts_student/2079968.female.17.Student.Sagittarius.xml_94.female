We had a great conversation...She was asking me about the year...She even helped recommend colleges and pointed me in some directions involving journalism. She suggested taking a summer photography course at tech just to get a feel for that. She's an awesome teacher...One of my favorites by far.  She was one of those teachers that worked you to death, yet later you learn to appreciate them because you figure out they were trying to prepare you for reality.  I even told her that, and I hope she knows I meant it sincerely, and I wasn't sucking up or anything.  It felt rather like a "Mr. Feeny-Student" moment.  It really helps to have people out there that you know are truly on your side and you know can give you practical advice that will be beneficial in the end.  Hooray for awesome teachers!  Now I need to study for my AP Psychology test.  It's about mental disorders and stuff.  Everytime I had to read for that chapter I felt like I had every single disorder.
