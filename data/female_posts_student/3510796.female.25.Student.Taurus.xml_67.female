It was nothing jolting, just enough so you could feel it.  I thought nothing of it, till she said she felt the ground shaking in her house.  Trying to explain the weirdness over the phone to Grey at the same time, I hadn't yet told her what it was when she broke off and said "The ground's shaking over here..."  Now, Grey and I live 90 miles apart.  So, if anyone out there was up around 1:15 Central Sunday night/Monday morning, and felt the ground rumble and shake for 10-15 seconds, could you back us up on this so we know we're not all bonkers?  Honestly, what the fuck just happened?
