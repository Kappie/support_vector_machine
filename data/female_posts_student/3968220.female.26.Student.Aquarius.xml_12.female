Hahahaha! then later we saw Julia Nin (korean name: Me Re), wad a funny korean name. then julia came 2 us n started 2 scratch us like a cat, we ran away but she chased after us, then she scratched my hand until it was swollen or so called"red". Luckily, chloe took down evidence by taking a photo of her scratching me wif her hp, next time can go report police, say she assault me!
