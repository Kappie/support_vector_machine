It is officially the weekend here, and I deserve a bit of time to myself.  Although it's not like I have anything to do at Beit Belgia, my home away from home.   I checked my blog today to see if there were any comments, and was quite dismayed to see that the keys words that were used to pull advertising for today were flip flops!  I don't want an ad for flip flop distributors on my blog! I hate the darned things (although I must admit that I'm growing more used to them). So I found out that there was a press release put out about the Neanderthal tooth we found at Crvena Stijena.  This is kind of silly, because it was completely out of context and not very meaningful.  I mean, if Neanderthals lived there long enough to build up 11+ meters of deposits, there ought to be at least a tooth or two laying around.  Anyway, the press release claimed that the tooth dates between 40-150,000.  This is a total farce, as we have no idea at all what the MP layers date to.  None at all.  Could be 35-350,000 for all we know.  Anyway, I just find it kind of annoying. Since I've been here nearly 2 weeks now, my lack of a washing machine is going to start to become a problem.  I have been washing socks/underwear/tank tops in the bathtub, but the pants are more difficult, because they're all long pants and they're cotton and thus will take FOREVER to dry.  But I remember how damn stinky my pants got after a few weeks of wear in Montenegro... so I guess I'll have to do something about it before too long.  Of course, I can wash myself here, and my work isn't dirty, so that probably helps.   Actually, come to think of it, I can't believe it's been two weeks since I left home already.  Time has gone by super fast.  Way faster than that time in Montenegro.  I find this a good sign, as it seems to mean that I can focus attention on bone for many hours a day and not want to kill myself. Okay, hmm.  Off to catch up with email...
