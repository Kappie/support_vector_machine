I remember I had this stuck in my head for a good part of the summer.  So here I am, sitting at my desk, Bailey cracked open, doing a chapter summary. I know I'm supposed to be taking care of the term paper first, especially because it's due on Friday and I should probably work on it (I haven't touched it yet). But it's just one of those things where you know it's inevitable but you avoid it anyways. Or as long as you can.  Volunteering at the hospital yesterday. I honestly love it, no matter that it takes up three (usually four) hours of my time these days. It's one place where I can go about and be nice to everyone and nobody knows who I am during the school day. And it's just so nice to be helping people--the greatest are the discharges, where you know that your patient is happy to be going home and you can be happy with them. Isa was there, though, rescheduling. I can't believe how strict she is...maybe before I'd just never really come in contact with her in person before, and she was kind of snappy. Mercurial. So she gets on my case on how I'm not scheduled for Tuesday (what the hell? I talked to her about rescheduling to Tuesday) and made me temporary COD until Dan comes, etc. etc. I also snuck a peek at my hour log. It's kind of disconcerting...I saw that last month I had 12.5 hours (ok) and the month before was 8.something. I'm not sure. I just hope I had 100 or more by now, and I don't know if forgetting to sign out changes anything. I'm so stupid. I should take care of it, but I just forget to. I think I met a decent guy, but I'm pretty sure it's one of those little chimeras that disappear once you get to know them more. He goes to Moorpark, runs cross country, etc., and just got his permit before coming to the hospital Tues. He's mildly sarcastic (as opposed to very sarcastic) and spontaneous. I don't want to seem like a little subservient fool, though. If it works out, it works out. I'm not searching for that kind of thing anyways, but it's difficult to find decent people even when you're not looking at them beyond what they are to a normal passerby. Maybe I am picky, but I'll probably rethink it dramatically if I find out he's not exactly bright or if there's some other "fault" of his. I don't know. I'm not looking for anyone. And I really shouldn't care about this kind of thing right now.  "your hair/it's everywhere/screaming infidelities/and taking its wear"  Mock trial last night, the downer that interrupted my happiness at the hospital. I don't know what's wrong with me, but every time I go up there I get kinks in my questioning and I have to stand there while Julia tells me what to do. I almost broke down and just cried into the podium last night not because she was particularly mean but just because I was so tired of it all. I really don't know about mock trial this year. Everything about me wants us to do well because we have gotten so close before and I don't see why this year we can't just overcome that 2nd place and go to state. But it's bad during practices. You just sit there until it's your turn to cross or direct. I miss Erum in there to chat with, and Doupe's on prosecution and prefers to fraternize with other people. I don't blame him. I just want to do well, and I also want to be able to do my part. If I'm the least significant lawyer this year, I think it's time to rethink things.  Harrison and Julia still have issues with "pseudo boyfriend" and "shadow boyfriend." In their usual cackly way they've managed to infiltrate into the matter and just make too much of it. They've told me that they don't approve of the match, etc. (you must remember that Ryan isn't one of those colorful types that they smile upon) and have tried to set me up with Doupe, but I know that won't happen and I might as well wipe all traces of that out of my head. I just don't want to be associated with him anymore. It's so weird, I just don't.  A crap of a schedule this week. I'm not going to play piano today because I know the Chopin will just wear me out and my arms are tired already from typing this :) and I'm also hoping that the Conejo/choir thing is on SATURDAY, the same day as Colburn and, more importantly, Mr. Francis's impromptu recital. I really don't want to go. I hate performing piano because of the stress practicing and playing when you're up. It's just not a happy affair. I just want the concert to be on Saturday so I can skip colburn and Mr. Francis's recital. Only thing is...oh, shit, it's worse than I thought...Ed Lan, Wendy and I (I think that's it) all have to cop out. I think Wendy would; she's not too excited about this stuff either, but Ed would probably go, which makes it so that we have to go too. Ahhh.   Journalism deadline is Monday, so we're working our butts off this week. I got kicked out by the janitor today. I think one of these days he's just going to blow up and yell at me. He caught me tutoring once in the hallway and then another time today in 42E. I heard him dragging the trash cans around and all but had no idea that he actually went inside each and every room and cleaned out the trash cans, so I was just sitting tight hoping that he wouldn't check in Battaglia's. Yeah right. I'd closed the door right before because I hoped that would deter him, but pretty soon he wiggled the doorknob, took out his keys and came in. He was pretty calm about it, but I don't want to stretch it.  The OC's on in a few minutes. I'm tempted to watch. It's supposed to be a rerun, or so Scott says. Haha, good time to catch up.  I think the paper's actually going to come together fine this issue, except the center spread is another manufactured product from the center spread factory and if I had my say I'd change it. But you know what happens when you do. I hate Brandon. According to An ("An!") the soph and jr. girls are crazy about him, but I really wonder why. Sure, he's the type that is all touchy feely and all--even to me, so go figure--but he can be such a (and I use this word sparingly) bitch sometimes. He totally mocks me ("shut uuuup!") and he'll be mean and judgmental while Keira here is the angel on his shoulder. Not that he listens. Ok, so he's good at graphics, but I just think he's too difficult, too hoity toity. And he left his backpack in the classroom. I wonder what he does tomorrow morning. Tiff and I were walking one day right after 1st and we seem him just standing outside, not talking to anyone, outside his English classroom since his teacher wasn't there yet. And he complains to Pegleg how annoying :) Ryan is in Spanish. I much prefer Jonathan to Brandon.  Did 3 miles today. I hope that makes up for the C+ and buoys me back to an A, but I have fears that Flanderka will tell me that I can only do so much and raise my grade so much (will I end up with a B instead?) and I know I'll be devastated. She initially told me 12 laps (which I did today) but what if she changes her mind? Tiff has 20 because she did some another day with Desiree. I just hope it fixes the problem. We dedicated our laps to Costley. Damn it all.  It is so freezing cold lately.  Back to hw. Or The OC.
