My weekend has been spent trying to forget this fact. Last year, when I chose my subjects I decided to chose Chemistry, with the idea that it would probably help me out later on in life and give me lots of juicy options considering I had no idea whatsoever what career I would chose. That was last year. I decided this year that I want to be a journalist, and to become a journalist, I have no real need for Chemistry. With this new information I decided at the start of this term to change into Environmental Systems, and all was joyful. For one week, before they told me that I actually, if I follow the IB code correctly, am forbidden to take Biology and Environmental Systems together. This has left me in a very unhappy situation, seeing as I essentially now have to chose between Chemistry with an incredibly mentally challenged teacher or Economics which I have missed out on for an entire term (I only have like 6 more and not to mention exams in a month). Sigh, woe is me. Anyway, this means a sleepless night for me as I toss and turn trying to figure out which will be more beneficial to me in future.   Anyway, I may post later about the results of my STUPID AND POINTLESS DILEMMA!!!  Catch ya
