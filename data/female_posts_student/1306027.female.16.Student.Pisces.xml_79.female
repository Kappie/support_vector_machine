Today I had to go see the Allergist. No, he is not someone who causes allergies. He's the person that tells you if you have allergies or not. How does this man accomplish such a feat? Well- he gets his nurse to plunge about 24 needles in your back, and 9 needles in your arm. Painful? O sure. But what is pain when you need to find out that you are allergic to hickory tree pollen? Nothing I say, nothing. Ha- if only pain were nothing. Maybe then I wouldn't have screamed out in sheer agony at the doctors office today. The arm needles I could handle- but when they plunge a clump of six needles into your back then it's over. It's like living the julius cesar scenario, only skipping out on the "et tu brutus". I am not exaggerating! It hurt! It hurt alot! Not to mention, now I have all these little bumps all over my back that itch. Their are a couple of bumps on my arm, but they are hardly noticeable because of the pen marks that designated where the needle met my skin. Grotesque? You know it. But I think I may live. If I don't die of over-itch.   So anyways- Im on allergy meds and stuff  Which, really wasn't all that different than before. They said my breathing was good, and that I seemed to be getting enough oxygen to my vital organs (thats questionible though) all that was wrong is this stupid cough, and the fact that I am not getting any sleep.   Yea, so, no sleep is really affecting me.  I been really cranky and all. I'm hoping that they get me some stuff that will help me sleep too. That away- I sleep! And, Im not cranky! Because perky people don't like cranky people. And- well... I think my parents are sick of me being cranky too. I'm even sick of me being cranky! It sucks! In the 3rd degree. I'll be ok though. Eventually.    I leave you with this....I have a hamster named Midas
