The lovely bitches at the weather center are telling us that we're supposed to get between an additional 12 to 18 inches of snow.  FUCK THAT!  This sucks.  (Also, I'm not really this fat, I have lots of layers on...so shut your mouth!)  This is me and my mommy oustide shoveling.  We had to do the whole driveway by ourselves becuase my brother is a lazy pot smoking monkey who is upstairs and still asleep at between 9 a.m. and  11 a.m.    If you don't think my driveway is that long so it shouldn't be that hard...think again.  We're gonna pool money next time and get a fuckin' plow dude to come.    Even if we could save our money we wouldn't be able to get a plow guy here anyhow cause my town does such a shitty job plowing roads and now they've had to declare a state of emergency so no one can drive anywhere...      Thats it for now, I am only goign to get more angry and more stircrazy (mmm....stircrazy) as the day goes on.  Anyone know where's nice in Arizona or somewhere warm that I can move to??  I'll even settle for Texas.  A r g h !   I hate the winter.
