Charles Schumer's fondness for publicity was the subject of a little needling by New Jersey Sen. Jon Corzine at the recent 50th annual Washington Press Club Foundation Dinner.   "Frankly, sharing a media market with Chuck Schumer is like sharing a banana with a monkey," said the Garden Statesman. "Take a little bite of it, and he will throw his own feces at you."   Schumer, who wasn't at the dinner, was said to be irked by the simian swipe. But he tells The Hill: "It was all in good fun."   Looks like the New York/New Jersey feud lives on my friends, up to the very highest branches of our national government.
