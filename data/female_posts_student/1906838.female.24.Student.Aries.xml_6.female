The second years and third years have left for their hols long ago, the fifth years are waiting for graduation next week, and the fourth years who just ended their final (tenth) block last friday are no where to be seen.. although one or two fourth year who look like racoon zombies can be spotted heading to the lifts to get to the med school office on level ten. one or two .. hmmm.. you'd expect there to be more fourth years around today .. it being THE DAY for portfolio submission.  yes, the portfolio.. the final determinant of whether one gets to get his MB or not. omigod.. i had stayed up all night last night, doing last minute amendments to my case presentations, not mention trying to finish the neurosarcoidosis patient discussion ( hahaha.. i was always doing it in bits and pieces and because it was just too damn complicated, i never was really motivated to finish it.. till today of course because i had to hand it in). oh.. and the stupid little boxes at the back of the record of achievement. stupid little boxes. one may wonder, how can something so tiny be of so much trouble? hah .. well. these little boxes dont come alone.. they come in numbers.. and huge numbers there are and my.. are they annoyingly time consuming to do. now i understand why everyone makes a fuss about the little boxes.. hahaha.. and to think i only tried to do them the night of submission.   GOD .. im tired. okie bloggie.. talk to you tomorrow.
