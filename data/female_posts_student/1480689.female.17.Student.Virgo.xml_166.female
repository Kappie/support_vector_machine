Oh, but first i needed to go to the bank and take out money for my project. OS i go to the bank and withdraw $50. Then i start walking back to where i parked, but i stopped to talk to Aaron and then I got my movie back! yes! So i run home, jump in the shower, shave my legs and wash up. I got out and put on a really cute outfit. Short dark blue denim skirt with pinstripes and a fitted white shirt. I put my black and white checkered belt, my black flipflops, my sisters earrings and my studded collar. i threw my hair up to get it out of my face, and carefully put on my makeup. i brushed my hair out, put on my body spray and then applied some lipstick. I got in my car put on my sungalsses and drove over to Mike's to pick him up. I get there, and he's wearing his black hat, the grey atticus shirt underneath the light greenish blue striped dress shirt, a pair of one of the many written and drawn on jeans, mis-matched white socks, and black tennis shoes. Scruffy and looking tired, he walked with me to my car.       When we got to Fuddruckers, we waited in line for Benson and talked ot her for a bit. I had a 1/3 lb. bacon cheesburger and a strawberry shake. mike had a 2/3 lb. hot rocks? waht that it? and a chocolate shake, and fries. I put A1 and honey mustard on my burger. After dinner, we went over to Michael's and i got mat board for my project and stickers. Then we went back to my house and hung out in the basement. he layed on the couch, i cut my mat board. we talked, we laughed, we cuddled.      It made me happy and sad, all at the same time.
