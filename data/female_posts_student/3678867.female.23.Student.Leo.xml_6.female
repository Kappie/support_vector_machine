According to the EWG, only 11 percent of the 10,500 chemical ingredients used in personal-care products in the U.S. -- a category that includes deodorant, toothpaste, and makeup -- have been tested for safety. Unfortunately, they found that many chemicals in hair products contain known or possible carcinogens. Imdividually, these ingredients shouldn't really hurt us but since the average person uses approximately 10 different products a day, the risks could add up. Personal-care products are not required to undergo the same testing as food...so until they are, you can visit this site from EWG to discover which products you might want to avoid. I've looked at this site briefly. It is too scary for me, because the majority of anti-frizz hair products are apparently going to give me cancer one day. But, alas, the price of beauty has always been high...
