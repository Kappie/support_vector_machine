The truth, behind the words they read Open their eyes, soften their hearts Show them the truth that sets them apart Send me the words to help them find A way, to give You their all; soul, heart, and mind  Lord I try, and I cry Out to You, to save their soul So, when I die, I will find them there To meet with me again  He is flawless They are faithless I will witness To them But Im not perfect Im not flawless Though not faithless I too, had a witness  Lord I try, and I cry Out to You, to save their soul So, when I die, I will find them there To meet with me again
