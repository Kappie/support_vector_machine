I didn't sleep at all last night(if you must know, I was having the worst cramps  of my life , and I felt like DYING!), and so this morning, being as retarded as I am, I thought "hey, I can go rollerblading at 7 a.m.! Because, well, you know, that sounds like  so much fun!  So I left at about 7:30, and got back at 9....and I'm really tired. Sheesh...I'm ridiculously out of shape...and cranky. Not to mention I've already had my overdose of Advil for the day. "No more than six a day"...bah...I'm too good for their crazy rules and stuff. Alright...I'm going to...possibly sleep...though now I think it's next to impossible...
