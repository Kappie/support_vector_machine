Lots of streets to roam down, etc. Summer has always been my favorite season, most likely because there's no school. But every summer as far as I can remember I've always wanted to spend every day roaming through meadows, woods, and orchards. I would spend my time instead reading Calvin and Hobbes books, watching them walk through the woods behind their house, having their own make believe adventures, just the two of them. Last summer I started reading The Summer of the Monkeys (I didn't finish it) and the boy spent his time, again, in the woods behind his house, exploring and looking at the nature. I wish that I could have some sort of semi-wilderness near my house so that I could spend my days wandering rather than dreaming of wandering. Today I couldn't bring myself to do anything except for imagining that I could hop the fence of my back-yard and wander through trees barefooted, feeling the grass between my toes, and climbing oak trees until I could see a whole valley below my self. I also dreamed that I had a cabin, or some kind of a house, outside of the city, to lounge around all summer. I wish that I could be like Scout in To Kil a Mockingbird and spend everysummer with a few close friends, make-believing, wandering, and of course getting a little mischeif. Whenever I imagine the "perfect" suburban summer, I always think of friends running around at the park, having water gun fights in their front yards with kids on their blocks, and having barbeques at night. But of course, I have very few friends, and I don't like any of my neighbors. When you have woods behind your house, you don't need other people, roaming is a solo sport.  So then I thought of the "perfect" city summer, since the city's not too far, I could just light-rail it downtown. I see people roaming (again) window shopping and eating ice cream with friends, looking into the weird shops, visiting the library and looking at pictures in books. Only the problem for me is that I'm only fifteen, not allowed that freedom, I'm allowed to go to down town plaza, that's it. I can't roam anywhere else. Down town plaza gets boring really fast, and shopping (even if you don't spend any money it seems) wastes a lot of money. And of course, this brings back the necessity of having friends. You get tired of hanging out everyday with the same people, or they get sick of you. And friends can't always be reliable, you won't always want to do the same things together, they might want to try on clothes in every shop while you want to sit down on a bench, eat ice cream, and watch passers-by. My summer would have to be roaming through trees and nature, there's so much to do with nothing. The nature is always reliable, it will always be there and never deny you doing whatever it is that you want to do. Instead I sit here, looking out the window, at the oak trees, rustling with the breeze, right over my fence, in the neighbor's yard.
