I don't know, but lately I cant seem to tell whether its better knowing that K is in love with me or whether it would have been better for the both of us that this didn't happen. Don't get me wrong I don't regret it. I just think about the hurt that might come along. The hurt of loving too much or too little. The inevitable hurt.
