Peter Pan: " to die would be a great adventure" Maggie: "he is just a mean old man who needs a mommy very badly" Wendy:"give me a squench"(what in the world is a squench?)  *you know that place between sleeping and awake where you still remember dreaming.....well that is where i will always love you*
