Bad idea kids.  School!!!  OK The past two days I have been a servant in 5th grade and 2nd Grade.  Both have cool teachers.  Both have generally cool kids.  I am kidnapping Luke, a second grader, the coolest little kid in the world.  I said to Mrs. Palacios "That kid is so cool.  I wish he were my little brother."  She said "I KNOW!  He is the cutest little kid ever.  I want a son just like him."  Me too.  I felt bad for neglecting the other kids a little but he was cool.  There was this one kid, no names, who was clingy and annoying all day.  I thought it was pretty cool that no matter what I did I was cool just because I was 17.  Respect is nice.  I like little kids.  They say so much random stuff all day.  I am excited about being a parent.
