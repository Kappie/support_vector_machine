I finally let my guard down again and some bunghole has to go remind me of why I keep my guard up in the first place.  Boys are poop!  I put on my favorite pair of underware and surprise: I get my period which somehow was mysteriously late.  I open the hallway closet and no matter how neatly the sheets are folded one always falls on my head.  I start a school semester excited about my classes and end up withdrawing from half of them before the semester is through.  The person you WANT to call never does and the person you DON'T WANT always does.  One of my six cats will throwup in the house, and the moment I take my shoes off I'll step in it.  My mom will cook the "good dinners" on nights when I have school early and won't be here for 'em.
