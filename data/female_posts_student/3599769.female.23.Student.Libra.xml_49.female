C'mon go ahead, she's already at her lowest point in her life, nothing you can say now well destroy her.   ( Crying )  You: We need to talk. Me: (heart drops) Okay. You: i really thing we should put some distance in between us. Me: (knowing thats how breakups usually work, but doesn't want to believe it) Why? You: Because, I'm selfish and I only keep contact with you so that your not with anyone else. Me: Duh. You: I'm sorry. ( my reasons are somewhat the same) Me: Why? I'd like a explanation. You: Because I don't feel the same way about you anymore.  Me: I need more justification, what does that mean? What are u looking for? How could you pretend like I never existed? Why are u making me invisible? I hate you. You: I'm not making you invisible, I just have no intentions of being with you and its not fair to you or me. And if I knew what was making me do this I would make it stop.   Me: Are you fuckin' serious, all I wanted was a fighting chance. And you just want me to say okay so that you can have enough validation to be with new people. And if you think that my munchkins have stopped loving me or thinking about me this whole time your wrong. WRONG. You: (breaking down, sniffling) I know that. I just, I'm sorry. I'll call you back. Me: Please don't let this be the last time I talk to you. Please.  You: No i promise you it won't.   Me: crying, hysterically. Wondering who the hell up there thinks it funny to make me cry.  I know that I took some easy shots, and more was said, but thats pretty much the whole of it. So, please someone I know that breakups are supposed to be like this and are supposed to hurt, and that they make movies about this all the time but damm. I hate being the launch pad. Next girl he meets he will have realized that he does want all the things that we once had, and he will marry her.    So for all the boys out there, who treated that one girl real good but decided to let her go, you suck. and you never would know how good life with her could be because you didn't try.    Once he told me that my best talent was that I was a survivor. Up yours.
