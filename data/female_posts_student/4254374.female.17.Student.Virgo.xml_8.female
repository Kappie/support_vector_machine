Anyway, I was so fascinated by this pair of Latin dancers I saw outside the cafeteria, that I collided into a pole! Ouch, my pride hurt! I hope no one noticed!         Many of us can relate to this incident.  At times, we're so engrossed in something that looks captivating from afar, that we fail to see the obstacle before us till it's too late. Consequently, we collide into it,  we stumble.
