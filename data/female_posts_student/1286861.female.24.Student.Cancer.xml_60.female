Wayne and "It's Only Tuesday" Productions had a success...yeah for them!  Memorial Day was good. I worked from 8am to noon, Brenden picked me up and we went to see Shrek 2. We went to Olive Garden for an early dinner and then we spent the rest of the afternoon at home. It was very very nice.  Aasem texted me to let me know he was having a party that evening. We got cleaned up and went over to Karyn and Aasems house. It was alot of fun, saw some people I had not seen in a very long time. Some were even sad to hear I was moving. Makes me think I have made somewhat of an impression on thier lives. Amazing.  So I have given 30 days notice at the apartment complex here. I was given wrong information and I do not need to find someone to take the lease. I have given notice and I need to be out by July 1st. I start at In-N-Out on the 21st of June, so hopefully I will find a room or something before the end of the month.  Keep your fingers crossed, I will keep the blog updated.
