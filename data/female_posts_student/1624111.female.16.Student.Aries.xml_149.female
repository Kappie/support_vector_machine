From Kelly" it was sweet.  -Emily didnt stay up and talk to me for a while after everyone else was asleep. But i didnt pressure her to, either. Because i was so tired myself and because i didnt feel like making her do something she didnt want to do.  -We played taboo. Im much worse at taboo now than i used to be. Lack of inside jokes? i think so.  -Kara and Kelly and Emily talked about band for a long time  -Kelly and Heather and Caitlin and Emily and Kara and Me all talked about driving for a while...or i guess more so about drivers ed.  -I learned kara talks to eric a hell of a lot.  "AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?"  It was fun, it really was. Nice talking to my friends who i dont always get a chance to talk to. Talked to Caitlin for what seemed like more than usual and im glad because i want to be better friends with Caitlin and talk to her more and know her better and stuff. She's cool. Got to know Kelly a little better. Kelly's cool too. She should talk more at lunch.   I caught myself being a jealous bastard, though. Listening to Kara and Emily talk...mostly about Band. Kara probably talked to emily more than i did. That was kind of uncool. But then again, do i have any right to think "No! She's mine!"? Of course not. I want her all to myself... and is that rational and fair, amanda? Is that smart? Does that make any sense? Are you respecting other people's feelings? No. Don't be selfish. You can't do that with people.   Then again...is it selfish to want to give your time and help and love and...self (as in like...sharing who you are...sort of) to one specific person and not others? I guess its a twised kind of selfish. Or, i guess thats not the selfish part of it...the selfish part is the "is it selfish to want a specifc person to spend time with only you?" hmmm... i still think its a twisted sort of selfish. selfish jealousy.  The sad theme of the night was me feeling like something was missing. I mean, it was fun. i had fun. i really did. But it wasnt the all-consuming, happyfeeling fun from the sleepovers of olde. I felt...like i didnt know everyone very well. Our little group used to be so close, and now...compared to how close i used to feel, i feel kinda like were strangers now. I mean, we're not, but... i dont know. I felt kind of lonely, i guess. Kind of...uncomfortable? Kind of...like i was there but no one needed me. Like they wouldntve been sad if i left. Which is crazy because they would have, definitely. Its not like they dont love me...they do. I got called like 3 times yesterday to make sure/ask if i was going and stuff. Maybe i just... maybe my niche is gone. My place. My home. My...my talking to Emily the whole time and giggling a lot and staying up till crazy hours of the morning joking and talking about weird things and real things alike. I used to do that all the time. That was my thing that i did at sleepovers...and now its kind of gone. Not that i dont want to talk to Emily, of course. It just feels kind of awkward i guess. Or maybe i shouldnt worry about it. But id be afraid to insist on sitting next to her all night and stuff... afraid of what? i dont know. maybe having to fight kara for a spot and pretend like its not a big deal if she gets her way. its just a seat, right? who cares about that... just a friendship, right? Who needs one of those...       Anyway, so there was that. Feeling out of place because my job disappeared. Like happily showing up for another day of fulfilling work at your beloved family law firm and discovering that you now work for a new (jackass) boss and your job is to place the heads on bobblehead dolls in an assembly line. In the dark in Chicago winter with no heat. And they take your shoes. Well, maybe not exactly like that. More like...at 1:00, gently tossing Bob over to a trying-to-sleep Emily who's facing the other direction and ignoring you because she wants to get to bed and watching her remove him from ontop of her head, set him aside, unwanted and unembraced, and go back to her attempted slumber. without a word. When...once...i could have tossed that over, and she would have gone "Bob!" and hugged it tight, and then it would have disappeared into her sleeping bag to be all warm and cosy and had anyone tried to wrentch it from her grip...she would have complained and looked lonely until he was returned. But i guess i shouldnt complain about that... because... its not like i dont understand. Still kinda sad though... ill never get a real mental vacation again. And kara... oh, man. That was bad. When she was like "Emily doesnt want bob anymore. Why hold bob if she can hold Eric? No one needs bob. Hes been replaced." or something to that effect. I think i laughed when she said that because of how cruel it would have been had she meant it in the metaphorical Bob way. then again, i guess hes only a symbol for that for me. But enough about missing the old sleepovers...  People grow up, people change, things wont always stay the same. K, fine. But i didnt even get any real talking with Emily! Man, i wanted that. I guess its hard to get that when youre in a group. And if she isnt gonna stay up... its not really gonna happen.  Ah, i need Real talking. learning more about you talking. bonding talking. words with feelings and thoughts attatched. Words weighed down with all the subtext. not meaningless talk of scales and arpegios (not spelled right) for Slepak. Words so heavy it makes you smile to remember them because of how many different things were implied and understood in a single sentence. You know? real talking. so i can be happy and feel like i actually know this girl. I want that. (in a related topic: this is a big reason why i like English/books/writing)  So the next time i could get some of that talking would be....the weekend after valentine's weekend. so, now we're gonna cross our fingers for the 21st or 22nd. okay? And we're going to hope there isnt track that saturday morning. And we're going to hope there is no babysitting to be done. Or basketball games to attend. Or anything like that.   you know what i want? i think thats one of my three wishes...i want...i want to truly feel peaceful and comfortable. Every once in a while. It's been a while since i felt that way. Since there wasn't a worry hovering in the back of my mind, since there wasnt Want screaming his head off, since i could sleep without thinking about all the things i wish i could do or all teh things i wish i didnt have to do. Since i could pray a genuine prayer of thanks free from the guilt of knowing that i cant just be happy with everything i have. Since life wasnt running after me like that cop with the liquid metal arms from Terminator 2, and love trying to recite sonnets on secrets of my heart like when little kids scream words underwater in a pool to see if their friends can make out what theyre saying, and reason dangling limp and mute from the hangman's nuse while lynching emotion raves fanatically, and sanity falling ever so admirably on his own sword. Faith and idealism are sick, tired and weak with fever. About the only thing in tact is morlaity, a solemn guard...but even he's been seen nodding off now and then.  So what do i need? A faster car, to pick love up out of the water and give her lessons in annunciation, a sheriff and a doctor to round up emotion and resuscitate reason, a shrink for sanity, tylenol, chicken soup, and time for idealism and faith, and some caffine for morality. Or, to put it simply: i need to  talk  to Emily and feel better about how well i know her.  and how do i get that? i dont know. by waiting and hoping for 3 weeks, i guess. But if i dont get it then...damn will i be depressed.  Or am i already depressed? mmm, who knows, who knows. Im just crazy, thats waht i am. pure and simple crazy.  Im gonna go sleep now for a few hours. Ill write about fencing eventually. later today or tomorrow. Maybe post some pictures. gotta email those pictures to jenna and jessica and dana and erin and olga too. well, eventually.... oh, and remind me to talk about eyeliner sometime.  Final thought: its oddly comforting to watch people breathe. Or to watch sleeping people in general. People you actually like, anyway.
