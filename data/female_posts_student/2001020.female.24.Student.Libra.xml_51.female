I HATE: Saddam Hussein and George W. Bush. I MISS: R. I HEAR: CNN. I SEARCH: for someone like R. I WONDER: if I will ever really fall in love again. I REGRET: ever sleeping with or getting involved with E. I LOVE: my family. I ACHE: for R. I CARE: too much. I ALWAYS: bite my fingernails. I AM NOT: a slut. I DANCE: when I feel like it. I SING: in the car. I CRY: too much for my own good. I DO NOT ALWAYS: take care of myself. I FIGHT: just to make sure that the person cares. I WRITE: notes in class but not enough of what I want to. I WIN: hardly ever anymore, it seems. I LOSE: just about every day that I wake up. I CONFUSE: myself all the damn time. I LISTEN: to my heart sometimes. I CAN USUALLY BE FOUND: at the law school. I NEED: some serious R 'n R to figure myself out! I AM HAPPY ABOUT: the fact that it is getting warmer here. I SHOULD: really be studying.
