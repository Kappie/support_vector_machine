House singing is on (this will sound odd aka "what the...?" to most people who don't go to Toorak) we're singing the "friends" theme song and echoes - both of which sound awful at the moment. Not to mention the madrigals group - amigos para siempre...a beautiful song, but simply not suitable for teenagers voices - Sarah Brightman sings it - so geez! The homework seems to be piling up - on top of that I really need to study for the SATs - which I have absolutely no clue about because I live in Australia the land of the HSC. Aside from whining I do have some semblance of a life. Vague - yes....but moving on.... Worried 'bout a couple of friends - who I won't name in case those particular people read this and freak out...so Iâ€™ll use some Russian names...mainly 'Maryushka', who is really stressed at the moment. I think something happed with her and 'Anekei' and something just doesn't seem right. I wish I could see her more often, we really need to catch up sometime.  Everyone else seems pretty normal i.e. healthy (physically AND mentally). Marina is over from Germany for 3 weeks - which will be great!  I finally admit I'm crushing on this gorgeous guy - Artem...(mind you that IS his real name - well, actually it's Artemei, same diff) Which is stupid for  so many  reasons on  so many  levels...fortunately he will NEVER see this post... Homework is calling unfortunately...I'll probably just continue procrastinating...
