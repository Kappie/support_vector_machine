And rugby was canceled and well Taylor and I wanted to go home so we were walking to Shawnee and rhiannon and oh it started to sprinkle as we were walking out the door then it started to pour when we got by the church and then it started to hail when we crossed the street right after we passed some other church.  Anywho and then one of us was wearing beige pants and said on no! And we all looked at her and started laughing so hard! I must say that walking in the rain with those guys was a blast and a half! lol Oh! When we all looked at her Shawn didn't because he wasn't allowed we wouldn't let him! lol! It was great fun! I must say that when it rains I will always think of us all trying to be dry!Now that I am done bragging that I spent a awesome night well walk with rhiannon, Taylor, and Shawnee I should get to the part of my day where I really need to bitch! You know what is really stupid is when people that are 15 and have a boyfriend decide that they love their boyfriends and want to marry them! And the worst part is they say it about every guy they meet!  Like I really want a boyfriend but I really don't see my self marrying a guy I met when I was 15 and marry him when I am like 30 are they saying that can see anyone else? It's so stupid! Yah I am going to marry a guy I have know for what like 2 freaking months?! Wow I hope you have a loving future together! Better yet send me a post card from you honey moon when you freaking 18!!!! I think I maybe just jealous or something.  I JUST DON'T KNOW!!!! It all started with one stupid guy who was far from even getting a chance to date at all! Tonight I spent with Rhodes, and Shawn and Rhiannon and well lets just say it was a grand party! lol first the rain then the pissing off Spencer "You can't type!" - Taylor  "I can to type!" - Shawn *Shawn typing* "don't worry type" LOL! The funniest thing ever!!! My abs are perfect now! lol good times pissing off Spencer:D lol!  I must say I hardly spend time with Shawn but I really should spend more with him as if ummm lets seee.....2 1/.2 hours with him in one day defiantly isn't enough!  So as if rhiannon and I should spend anymore time together we go bottle/can collecting in the well rich end of the city up in the north lol and we go into this very familiar bay...hmmmm;) But the familiar thing didn't come running down the stairs ripping open the door and say "hi;)" lol and the thing wasn't as hot as we remembered....Maybe because it was a woman.....hmmm:P lol it was an awesome night I must say my friends and I have way to much fun! OH and rhiannon and I got at least a good 15 beer boxes from ONE house lol it was great then the another gave us $5 because she couldn't get to her bottles so rhiannon and I went for ice cream....mmmmmm to Planet Ice Cream....mmmmm.  Anyways I am out  later Gator!
