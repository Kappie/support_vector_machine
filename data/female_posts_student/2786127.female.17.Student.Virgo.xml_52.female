I've decided ONE reason why I like unattainable guys.   1. They're unpredictable. Theres always something mysterious about them, you never know what they're thinking. Its also the whole "fun of the hunt" deal too, I'm thinking.   so theres that.  today was pretty shitty, besides that. Lindsay is mad at me again, I'd rather not even write about it. It'll just depress me more about the situation, and possibly make me ten times more mad.  yes TEN times RARRRR  aslfkjdslkajgklj!!! kl.jsdgklh;drkgljgkljdgkl;hklgjdkgljdfd
