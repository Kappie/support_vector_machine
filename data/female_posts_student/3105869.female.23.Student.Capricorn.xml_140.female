How do I link Jurisdiction, Choice of Law and Recognition of Judgments in the International realm together, preferably with some coherence with only 25 minutes for the big essay [yeah, right, we'll see how big anything is in only 25 minutes], and 35 minutes for the 5 short answers that he is concerned we'll spend too much time on. Well, yes, Cochran, I would have to agree that's a valid pointfor concern especially since I am verbose, long-winded, etc. See, I can't even describe the lengthiness of my phrasing without using 2 terms to describe it. Lovely. Also, I think my short term memory bank is on back-order right now, maybe in a couple weeks it will have caught up with the increase in demand, more likely, It'll flatline and I will come back talking in tongues, twitching, with a mad case of terets. Okay, maybe not. It also occurred to me that I don't really know what he is going to test on specifically. Great, I am now also walking in blindfolded, better tread lightly .      I am inbetween classes right now. In the next class I'll get my nasty take-home final on the class that would have better been named  Promoting the Rule of Art and Bankruptcy law with Sandra Day O'Connor speaking in the middle classes . Definite lack of coherence there. How exactly does studying stolen art cases and bankruptcy code sections have to do directly with promoting the rule of law.Yes, I am sure there is some lovely B.S. way to explain that, but really, gimme a break promoting the rule ofa teacher whose husband likes to play stradivari violains, owns one, and thereis case law involving strads, so she talks aboutit. Whatever, how do I prepare to explain this....what if she asks: What did you learn from my class? as occured during Session1 in Espana. my answer:        1.) You like to talk too much and when we answer your questions, you doubtless will say we are wrong and then tell us the right answer is exactly what we just said.    2.) Your thought processes are muddled....you are as difficult to follow as Hegel, but Hegelian writings have the benefit of logic.    3.) You husband owns and plays a Strad and Guarneri. We're very happy for you.    4.) You chose cases that involve Strads and Guarneris, coincidence, I think not.    5.) Your husband came with you to Austria. I am seeing some connections finally.    6.) Your husband played in class and for Sandra Day O'Connor--aha you needed to justify his being here through your choice of classroom materials.    7.) I already took bankruptcy and answered all your questions in class.
