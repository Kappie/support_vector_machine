Friday ... saw  urlLink Troy  after dropping off the rugrats.  Great movie, made for females, not a single boob but you see as much of a naked many you can see at a rated R flick, oh and BRAD PITT!  Orlando was cute too.  They didn't even bother following the original story line, but who cares BRAD PITT, and it was still pretty cool.  Saturday ... went down to see Crystal at the shore.  Took the train and now I'm in love with any station beginging with R on the  urlLink NJ Transit , this includes Rahway where I left from.  I was there in an hour and a half, and ever sucker on the parkway and turnpike had to wait 3hours to get to Red Bank.  So  we went to  urlLink Headliners  after chilling around town.  It was great, but very different from off season (duh).  Very nyc crown there, and man it was crowded.  I remember people stepping on my feet but the huge bruise on my foot must have happened after I had the mind earaser.  All those red bulls and V (5) made me very energetic, but we had a blast dancing.  And so many men, so many looked the same and were UGLY, but the ones I liked I was dragged away from by Crystal (thankfully).  I was asking all of them if they liked the band TOOL, trying to prove there are quality men (in my eyes) at a club (some stuttering involved)...  Sunday ... woke up way to friggin early (10) to come home to go pick up furnture and go to a heated pool party (it was chilly).  BUT the truck BLEW A TIRE OUT after just getting to the mall.  LUCKILY we didn't die, but Ross went with the tow truck to get it back to Succusunna (thank god for AAA plus).  Well the truck starts to head back (where I was waiting for it) and the TOW TRUCK breaks down half way to the tire place. So they wait for another tow truck.  After an hour they just head back with an over heating tow truck w/ a truck on the back.  They get there and take an hour changing trucks, my Mom hears this and since she was in the area she heads to the tow place to save Ross, and to chew out some DeFalco idiots.  The truck broke at Two and was towed at 2:30pn, it was now 8:00pm all the while Ross is w/ the truck and I'm waiting for him and the truck.   FINALLY  my Mom and John bring Ross home at 9pm and we eat, the TRUCK gets tot he tire place at 10PM, EIGHT HOURS LATER. All the while my dad is chewing me out for reasons unknown, we are lucky to be alive and its not my fault he has crappy tires!!! Thus ruining my Sunday Plans...  Monday ... it rained I rested, all is right in the world...   So  now back to rugrats... late
