I really worked myself up beforehand and was sitting in the rare sunlight, when who should walk by.....drumroll.....Tullos. Yes the one and only leader of the hellish Legal Writing class. This did not improve my mood, rather it brought back haunting memories of my brief. She tried to give me a pep talk, and told me to go sit by the river and absorb the negatice ions. I almost laughed,but luckily stifled it into a cough in the nick of time. I asked what negative ions were, feigning interest, and wondering how I could desire anything else with the word "negative" in it. Not very convincing. I passed on the negative ions and opted to chug some machine dispensed nasty coffee and my requisite Diet Coke. I paced beforehand and he only gave us an hour for a total of six essays...yes it was open book, no that did not make it easier, quite the opposite. The questions required you to know EVERYTHING and be able to flip to it and hopefully cite it in TMinus 5 seconds. My long essay, the last one, worth the most, ended up looking like chicken scratch, but hey not my fault...you wanna read..lemme type, you wanna squint look at my writing. I have another final due by 9:15 am for promoting-the-rule-of-unrelated-stuff, its a page long fact pattern that is crazy far-fetched. My answer will be in keeping I assume. Anyway, must start. Plus, I have somewhere near 8 million pgs to read for the two new classes beginning tomorrow. Something tells me they'll get read over the weekend instead.
