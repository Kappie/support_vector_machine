I'm getting shit from everyone because when Sammy stayed over he shouted at his grandparents and didn't go home the next morning and stuff and because I got him "drunk", but I didn't, I wasn't telling him too, he picked up the alcohol, which I DIDN'T PAY FOR, and put it in his own mouth, no one forced him. I hate people like that, I didn't even get drunk. Well the rest of it was shit, we walked home with twats and I hate everything. Bye
