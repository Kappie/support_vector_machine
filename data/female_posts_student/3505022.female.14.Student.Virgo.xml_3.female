And John if you happen to read this, you already know that I like you, but do you know how much (hint: a lot!)?   So I just have one question, why does he like Lisa so much? Hasn't she told him that she just isn't interested in him? But that's ok because I realized something yesterday. If he is so in love with Lisa, let him because if he can't see someone who likes him who's right in front of him than I have no need for him. Why should I chase after someone who doesn't even feel the same?
