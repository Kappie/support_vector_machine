Well there are many things making me mind tick away today....considering i woke up at 11.30 (for me thats the longest sleep in ever)there really isnt much of a day so my brain is fitting in all this stuff into half a day lol  *-*Things making my brain tick -     him  - sooo much i could say, but there is sooo much that i have already said that i dont know where to begin. so here i go...im still gonna be ur friend, im still gonna be here for u, i just dont want to hear any more apoligising, taking back of things once said, bringing up the past, talking about me just being ahppy with some other person who doesnt exist casue well thats just stupid etc....if u want to move on, then shift ur butt into gear and MOVE FORWARD not into reverse...and can i just say i dont like it wen people try to speak for me or group me into how they are feeling, something that annoys me...thats all i have to say really on the whole situtaion....lets just move forward...so next time we speak....remeber what i have just said here and we will be fine ok....thanks  Fairy tale worlds and movies -  i saw "the prince and me" yesterday with jenny, poulos and bridey and well truthfully to me it really didnt cut it as far as a fairy tale story should go....it was kinda weird...excpet for when the prince proposes with a butterfly over this absolutly gorgeous ring...one of the most romantic thigns ever *sighs*....i think every girls dream at some stage is to be a princess...its just how it is, theres something magical about all those dresses and jewellery lol. i sat there talking to someone on msn yesterday about why some guys just have to hurt u on purpose and we decided that in our fairytale world, all guys are to be seperated from each other untill 21...that way they can all be like nice princes and u can see who they truely are with out the assholes they hang around with and are trying to impress....isnt that right poulos.  The line from the movie yesterday  - it was so true...it was something about love and was from romeo and juliet....somethign along the lines of "suns light can be clouded to stop somethign to do with heaven" truthfully i dont rememeber what it was but it made alot of sense....it basically ment that love makes u blind..being inlove means seeing only the good things and not being able to see the bad because u are blinded by ur love...so basically that has been going throughmy head as well....lol i just confused myself....if anyone knows the quote im talking about please let me no   A quote from another movie -  i was watching now and then today and the man known as 'crazy pete' said "many thing happen in your life which u cant stop or change, but they are no reason to shut out the rest of the world"...i think that peice of advice which everyone can take into account in some way or another...whether it be because of soemthing so large like a loss of a life or something small like coming last in something....just think about it...life will go on and there are always people around u even though u may not realise it that will make it better.  FRIENDS -  no matter what happens they are always there...u dont always think about it till there is something wrong or when u feel like u really need them....but just letting u all know..no matter what happens...u guys are all the best and i wouldnt replace any of u...i love u all  The end of Bush week -   all though u might not all realise it...today is the last day of bush week for th year 2004...i hope u all enjoyed it and we all anxiously await its return next year....and just remeber when something happens that is out of the ordinary u have to say "what is this bush week" because thats wat bush week is all about...expecting the unexpected They are a few of the things running through my head today...very random and often very confusing i know but they make sense to me lol....oh and this is a little note for jenny...i hope she can catch on "im the one who put u on the top of my "to do" list" LOLOLOL hahaha....catch my drift lol... checkyas laters...MWA
