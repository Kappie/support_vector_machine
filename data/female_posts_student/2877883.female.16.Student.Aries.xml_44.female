Not something to be proud of.    I have to write an ode for English.  Don't know what topic yet.  Suggestions?  Easy history test today.  Nice. B+ Winter's Tale Soundtrack.  Not too bad.  Rewrite?  Uhh probably not.   Gym first... lots of obscure running exercises.  It was pretty fun though, I'd say.  Apparently my art teacher sent my Hawaiian flower collage to some art show. At Mt. Wachusett or something.  That's what she said.   Exciting, even though she just told me today.    I've been doing some heavy reading from the driver's book since hopefully I shall get my permit this week.  Friday, maybe, if they're open.    I hope so badly that my mini ipod comes in soon.  Please Please Please.    Grades close Thursday... Bio isn't looking hopeful.  Please please 90.  English i think I have an A-... Actually so excited about that one.  I'm really sick of myself as I am.  I need to change.
