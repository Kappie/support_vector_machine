And I'll send it to your email - if I see fit to.)  Clare says: HELLO!! Clare says: Wow I saw you waving Clare says: Well I saw you waving and had no clue who it was; it took us ages to work it out  Jools says: Huh. Clare says: When we were camping Clare says: And you were in Puja's car?? Clare says: That was you guys, right? Jools says: Oh yes Jools says: That sleepover Jools says: Silly me Clare says:  Wasn't me, at all, I haven't fallen out with you, I've explained it ALLLL to Pooj but if that's how u want to see it *shrugs*  Jools says: Y'know the three major problems I have with falling out with y'all? 1) I miss you like hell 2) Le Fousseau will be craptastic if we're laying into each other the whole time and 3) I wanna big birthday party with a bouncy castle but I'm not allowed it for only three people  Clare says: Awwwwww three people? Jools says: Me, Pooj, Ria Clare says: I don't understand why everyone's fallen out at all Clare says: I don't understand where it all came from Jools says: But do I really want a party with people who hate me? And who prank me for staying out of their way? Hmm, I dunno Jools says: Maybe I should just invite Katherine's friends cuz they're a lot nicer Clare says: I was no part of the pranking, Amy and me just sat there mainly while they were doing that Clare says: And then they wanted to do it again and Loz and me just told them to f off lol Jools says: Amy?!  Clare says: Loz didn't do it either Clare says: Amy was there (Mel's party, they're mates) Clare says: I felt SO sorry for her Clare says: I think she felt left out Clare says: LMAO and the next day Mel was still asleep in the tent so we tied her to the base of it and screamed that there was a fire Jools says: So there wasn't really one? And Mel didn't asphyxiate? Shucks. Jools says: Oh, sorry, you like her Jools says: Well, you do at the moment anyway Clare says: Yeah I do but I can understand why you don't Jools says: *Rolls eyes* Cuz she hates me for no reason Jools says: Same as with Charlo but I'm sooo gonna stop here for fear of having my house egged or something  Clare says: I don't think Mel hates you, it wasn't her, it was Charlo Jools says: Oh no, Mel doesn't hate me at all Jools says: Why, we're bestest buddies Jools says: Brb, I'm gonna go have tea and crumpets with my chum Mel *glares* Clare says: Lol. Well, I still like you and Pooj and I don't know why they don't ... Well â€¦ I do ... but the reasons they have don't piss me off Clare says: If that makes any sense Jools says: It does Jools says: Though all we've done is what they want Jools says: Like, they get pissed off with us for going on about guys, we go off to talk about guys, they don't like it, we try to hang out with you, there is total and utter silence, we leave, they don't like it  Clare says: Ah, as they see it you don't like us and that's why you're always going off. I probably don't get pissed off for I am also a boy obsessive Jools says: And the thing about your bag, for god's sake! If we had stolen it, 1) We wouldn't have stolen yours and 2) We wouldn't have given it back! Clare says: Lol, I didn't believe that  Clare says: No, I mean I didn't believe you took my bag Clare says: Sorry, came out wrong lol Clare says: I'm really pissed about Fousseau though, I really hated the way they just came up too you guys and go "You HAVE to move" Clare says: If it's not resolved by the time we get to Fousseau I'll probably go cuz if we fall out anymore Fousseau is gonna crap up  Jools says: And then there's all you thinking we run away from you, when we don't, and we reckon you're running away from us half the time, so there must be some huge misunderstanding that's made me truly depressed and now my mum wants to talk to Miss Imber! Jools says: At least you guys didn't prank me at one in the morning, or my mum would be really annoyed Jools says: And Pooj's calculator! What was that about?? Clare says: Dunno, I left it with Loz Clare says: I said I'd buy her a new one when I got mine cuz I was the one who left it with Loz Jools says: Yeah, but you know damn well what Mel was doing Jools says: It's cute how insecure Mel is Jools says: She knows what it's like to be shunned, so she's being extra-nasty to avoid it  Jools says: But it's not going to last.  People aren't shoved out for eternity.  I mean, look at Loz!  Sure, she's really paranoid now, but at least she's mates with all of you lot  Jools says: I suppose it's the circle of life.  There's always gonna be someone who gets blanked out Jools says: In the shells, it was Pooj, then Loz, this year it was Lucy, now me and Pooj  Jools says: Well hey, look who's lined up for the third year Clare says: You and Pooj aren't being blanked out, you two secluded yourselves. Originally it was Pooj, Jools and Clare if you remember but then guess who got shoved out?? EVERYONE else Clare says: I'm not having a go Clare says: It's just Clare says: It's always been you two Clare says: And you never let anyone else in Clare says: Without being hypo Clare says: That's where everyone get fed up, and everyone just thought if they don't wanna be with us, then why do we want to be with them? Clare says: Therefore we left you alone Clare says: And then all this stuff happened where apparently everyone was pissed at me Clare says: I left it at that Clare says: And now everyone's fallen out  Jools says: Oh my god *hits self on head* this is just one big misunderstanding Jools says: Hold on, lemme explain Jools says: At Easter, Pooj told me that you and Charlo said you were annoyed with me for going on about Elliott Jools says: So then Pooj got a crush on *** Clare says: I was NEVER annoyed at u for going on about Elliott.   Jools says: Well, anyway, it doesn't matter  Clare says: I'll tell you bout that in a moment Clare says: Okay Clare says: Carry on Jools says: So we reckoned that it was best if we kept out of your way, cuz you know how we both like a good rant about fit guys Jools says: (At that point I didn't know how mad you were about Matt) Jools says: So we'd just go off and talk about Elliott, Andrew, etc Clare says: Okay Clare says: (Whoever Andrew is) Clare says: Lol  Jools says: And then one lunchtime we were sitting on the benches outside the English block Jools says: And we saw you lot coming up from the language block towards us Clare says: OH CRAP (carry on) I just wrote on my birth certificate by accident, oh noo Jools says: And you saw us, you turned around, and then suddenly everyone was moving in the opposite direction Clare says:  Really? Jools says: So me and Pooj were like, "So it's like that, is it" Jools says: And we started kinda avoiding you, cuz we reckoned that you lot were REALLY pissed at us Clare says: Ahh, I see Clare says: Is there more or is that the end? Jools says: Hold on, Jeremery's talking Clare says: Okay  Jools says: (Sorry, I always get distracted by pretty flashing lights) Clare says: Lol  Jools says: And the whole thing at Easter ... Pooj told me that you two we pissed off with me so I was like "Woah".  I wasn't like, pissed off with you, I was like, okay, what do I do now? So I backed off a bit ... a lot ... yeah. Clare says:  Us two being who? Clare says: I don't remember being pissed at all  Jools says: And then there was the Mel thing when term started again ... I mean, you SAID you were on my side but there was Mel taking the piss out of me all lunchtime, with you and charlotte almost pissing yourselves about it (although trying to conceal it when I was there)  Jools says: And there was something else ...  I'm trying to get this all sorted out so there's no tension back at school (but I'm still not talking to Mel or Charlotte) Clare says: I'll admit to that even though I got so sick of it by the end and by the fact that you nearly started crying so I told her to shut up Clare says: Ohh I know what it was Clare says: Something about me being a hypocrite? Clare says: I think?? Jools says: *Cocks head to one side* you wha huh? Jools says: There was the thing about me being pissed off with you, but I wasn't Jools says: I thought you were pissed off with me Jools says: And I said some stuff to Mel to cheer her up and cuz I was feeling really bitter Clare says: Was that in history?? Cuz Charlo was asking the questions not me and then I found out you were on about me I was like ... oh, pml  Jools says: Yeah, that thing in history Clare says: If Charlo says anything just tell her to piss the hell off, okay? Clare says: I've already told her to lay off you but if she doesn't listen don't listen to anything she says just block her Jools says: She just said "Heya" Clare says: And I'll stick up for you at school as well if she says anything Jools says: But I'm blanking her so *shrugs* she can shove her pranks up her arse and piss off, in the (slightly altered) words of Freddie Mercury Clare says: LMAO  Jools says: It's in house of rock Jools says: That episode is soooooooo funny Clare says: ARGH CHARLOTTE   Jools says: Whattabout Charlotte? Clare says: Sorry Clare says: Lol Clare says: She's being a twat about this whole thing Clare says: Cuz I told her to lay off cuz I don't think it's fair and I think we should make up and she thinks you're doing it just to stay in the Fousseau room.  I've already told her I'll go if we don't settle this Clare says: *Calms down* Clare says: Lol, sorry Jools says: Right, hold on a moment, I'm just gonna have a word with Charlotte Clare says: NOO Clare says: DON'T Clare says: DON'T Clare says: DON'T Jools says: Wait, she's blocked me Clare says: DOOOOOOON'TTTTT Jools says: Well, that's convenient Clare says: Ach. Do you have Broadband, btw? Jools says: I was gonna say "I WOULD RATHER SUCK OFF HORVATH THAN STAY IN A ROOM IN FOUSSEAU WITH YOU, SO YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT." Jools says: Nope, don't have Broadband Clare says: Dang nabbit  Jools says: Should I email her that ... *strokes chin in thought* Clare says: Nah don't cuz then we'll fall out even MORE and I really want everyone to make peace  Jools says: So do I, that's why I'm not talking to Mel or Charlotte   Jools says: Soo much more peaceful Clare says: Btw, I'm not trying to judge ANYTHING but do you like Ria now? Just so I don't offend anyone by what I say or do??  Jools says: Yeah I do like her, I think the only reason I didn't like her was that she didn't like me  Jools says: But I don't really know her Clare says: Oki doki, I'll zip myself shut, lol Jools says: Well, I don't really know her well enough to tell her anything you would say Jools says: And now I really wanna know *hops from one foot to the other* Clare says: Lol, you already know basically, I just didn't wanna complain about her if you had become good mates with her Clare says: Or were becoming Clare says: In case I offended you Clare says: I don't like her cause I know what she says about us from Dap  Jools says:  Woah.  has she said anything about me or Pooj? (Sorry, I know I'm really self-centred.  It comes from only having to focus on oneself and only one other person for so long) Clare says: Oh she just talks about all of us. Before she started hanging around with you two, she said her least favourite person in the class was you, and Pooj second, then Mel third, then me fourth Clare says: And then Charlo asked her again Clare says: And she goes, "Yeah, I like them," and Charlo goes, "But the other week you said you didn't," and she goes "No, I didn't." Clare says: AHHH I'm sorry, I'll shut up, I'm causing more distress Clare says: Sorry I forgot my peace aim then Jools says: Well I s'pose she wouldn't've wanted her two only mates to find out that a few days ago she hated us Jools says: Screw peace.  Arguments are fun. Jools says: Unless they're like this one ... you should've seen the state I was in after that prank  ools says: My sister and mum hate you, Charlo, Mel, Loz and Lumo now Jools says: My dad doesn't care though Clare says: Really? I GLADLY had nothing to do with it Clare says: The one about Puja was worse though Clare says: I think there was something to do with an Indian accent? Clare says: I just left the tent Clare says: And ran around Jools says: My mum goes, "Ju got pranked by some ex-friends today," and my dad goes, "Well, she probably deserved it" Clare says: Well, if it makes you feel any better I scared the crap out of them at that sleepover Clare says: It was proper funny, I told them all about my mum being psychic, and then a few hours later Clare says: I went Clare says: TURN THE LIGHTS ON TURN THE LIGHTS ON NOW Clare says: And they all crapped themselves Clare says: It was damn funny Jools says: Lol Clare says: They didn't think it was though Jools says: But god ... the ones they did to pooj were more insulting to me than her Clare says: They all had a right go at me Clare says: Especially Lucy Clare says: Were they? Clare says: What did they say?  Jools says: Yup Jools says: The first one was just, "Hi, it's Tom, do you wanna go out on Friday?" but the second one was, "Hi, it's Jools, I'm a bitch and I just got back from America ..." or something like that Jools says: God, I have this horrible feeling you're just sitting there laughing at me while I pour all this out Jools says: And telling Charlo Clare says: You can ring me if you like, I'm as serious as a ... what's serious? A legal document? Clare says: I swear to god I'm not telling Charlo Jools says: And then the two of you having a right old chuckle Clare says: Here, I'll copy and paste the convo Clare says: Charlo says: What's she said?? Charlo says: Cuz she won't talk to me Charlo says: ......... Clare says: Nothing, it's just she's told me her side of the story Clare  says: And I really think we should make up with her cuz she's really, really upset Charlo says: Oooh, oooh, spill Clare  says: And I feel really sorry for her Charlo says: You can, but you know she's probably doing this so she can stay in our room Charlo says: Please copy and paste it Clare  says: No, cuz you'll just twist it Clare says: And then she either blocked me or went offline Jools says: I really want to send her that email ... can't I send her that email?? Oh ... Jools says: She's SO not invited to ma party  Clare says: I wouldn't give it the time of day Clare says: The email that is Jools says: I just want to get everything clear in her puny brain  I truly don't want to spend any time at all in your room cuz (no offence) you've made my life total hell for the past two months Jools says: I've cried so much about this over this past week it's incredible that my eyes haven't run out of moisture.  And that I have any mascara left cuz it keeps running.   Clare says: I didn't even realise anything was affecting you, was it the prank thing that made you cry or did they do something else? Did I do something else??? Clare says: I thought you'd know cuz I told Pooj I wasn't pissed at you and stuff but I thought you hated me therefore you wouldn't care ...? But I'm not sure she's told you Jools says: Well, you know on the 1st April when no one could go out and you and Charlo had that sleepover and we haven't really been properly friends since then?? Jools says: Yeah, Pooj told me but she didn't really believe you Jools says: At all Clare says: Yeah Clare says: I've gotta be a little bit more honest Clare says: I wasn't pissed at you at all Clare says: I was a bit pissed at her Clare says: I can't remember even why now Jools says: Oh? Well, I don't wanna really get into this, cuz I'm gonna have to tell her everything you do realise, and so ... yeah Clare says: But then I sort of figured how stupid I was Clare says: Yeah, I think she knows Clare says: I think I told her?? Clare says: Ah well Clare says: If not, there you are Clare says: Lol  Jools says: Anyway, there were these really nice jeans in Skud that I wasn't allowed, so I just thought, hey, I'm not allowed anything, jeans, shoes, dresses, and then I thought that if I'd been allowed out that one night, we wouldn't've fallen out, cuz you and Charlo wouldn't've had that sleepover that really sparked everything off Jools says: So I was crying my eyes out Clare says: No, I know what started everything off and it DEFINITELY was not your fault Jools says: Cuz I just wanted everything to be how it was in September or March, cuz Dan wasn't having a go at me and we hadn't fallen out Clare says: I'm not trying to point fingers â€¦ but I know for a fact that Charlotte's never really liked you. And I thought she was alright but she'd been really influenced by Ria in the past Jools says: Oh? Jools says: (But my mum thought I was crying about not being allowed the trousers so she let me have these gorgeous shoes that previously she wouldn't let me have cuz they were too high, lool) Clare says: Right stuff all this explaining infact; cuz it's not gonna get me anywhere it's just going to lead to my own better understanding and probably a more confuddled vision on your own side; so all I'm gonna say is that I'm really super sorry for anything I've done to make you upset I had no idea that you were this distraught. I'm really super duper sorry and if you want me to stick up for you just ask cause I feel SO guilty for not getting rid of the prank thing and just going in the garden Jools says: I had such a stress when you started talking to me Jools says: I was like, "Oh my God, the last time I spoke to any of them was the 28th and that was when Charlotte had a huuuge go ..." Clare says: I didn't know you were pissed. I bet you were like, ARGH, BITCH, TALKING TO ME ABOUT THAT SLEEPOVER Clare says: But I didn't know much about the pranks  Jools says: I thought you were gonna have a go at me Clare says:  Why would I have a go at you? Jools says: Or say something really nasty and block me Jools says: Cuz I thought you and Charlotte were like, proper best friends and everything, and she's always really mean to me on MSN Clare says: Hmm, funny situation with me and Charlo at the minute, lol Clare says: As long as she likes Ria, I could never be her best mate Clare says: I mean, I still like her Jools says: I thought she didn't like Ria  Clare says: But she knows exactly what Ria's like  Jools says: Ria was only hanging out with us cuz Charlotte was blanking her out Jools says: And Ria's nice and everything but ... me and Pooj are like, y'know .. Jools says: Everything was really weird with her there Jools says: We're used to all the rest of you Jools says: But Ria? It just doesn't happen Jools says: And I'm always really quiet with people I don't know Jools says: So if Pooj left us alone for a minute, I'd be like, all clammed up Jools says: It wasn't v. nice Jools says: Sorry, I'm rambling here Clare says: No, it's alright Clare says: Ramble away Clare says: You know what I'm like, for Christ's sake, lol Jools says: Lol Jools says: I might just put Charlotte and Mel into a contacts group of their own and call it "The Bitches" and block them both  Jools says: But I've already got all of Mel's accounts in one group, and every single one is blocked Jools says: And if it's true confessions time, I NEVER blocked charlotte Clare says: Ooo! I have a confession as well Jools says: I wish I had, cuz it would've been way less trouble, but I DIDN'T Jools says: Ooo?? Clare says: My confession is Clare says: Yeah, I did block you, but I didn't mean it in offence to you, I just did it because you were being a bit too sarcastic and sardonic for a person who has had the worst Friday in a lifetime, lol!! I just couldn't take it at that moment so I thought stuff it, blocked everyone that was talking to me except Dap cuz I was rambling on to her about (woe betide) my bad Friday, lol  Clare says: I really didn't mean it just to piss you off Jools says: Oh yeah, about that Jools says: You blocked me on Friday, and then Pooj said something to you about it, and you unblocked me Clare says: She didn't say anything Clare says: It was when I saw your name I unblocked you  Jools says: But then when I came online again, you'd blocked me again, and that was like, on the Monday or something Jools says: So you wouldda blocked me again over the weekend Jools says: And I was like, "Whaaaaat?" Clare says: Did I end up leaving the conversation with you and pooj in a bit of a huff? Jools says: Yup Clare says: Ahhh Clare says: Then I was probably just being moody Clare says: Iggy me, lol Jools says: Okies, lol Jools says: I thought I was being really clever then, pml Clare says: OH YEAH, I remember Clare says: Cuz I forgot to unblock you again Clare says: And then Pooj had a huge go at me for blocking you and why did I do it Clare says: And I was like I couldn't even remember blocking you, lol  There was more, but I forgot to save it.  And there was more after that that I did save, but it's unimportant.  Unless you're reeeally nosy.    I was re-reading it and a lot of the things she said I'm really annoyed about now.  Oh well.  And I am talking to Charlotte, but it's TOTALLY not my fault.  She just keeps talking to me.  Bitch.  Not talking to Mel though.  She's totally sucking up to Pooj, but she's not talking to me or something.  Well at least she's in pain.  MWUH HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH.  I'm gonna go now, cuz I think Pooj wants to read it.  And her boyfriend is so bloody fit!!  *Spits* Aw, I'm only kidding, Pooj.  Leave comments on my blog, people!  Leave them!  Hey, new rule, you read, you comment.  If you don't, then I sentence you to smelling for the rest of your life.  And as Sean says, if you do, I shall give you a million love dollars.  Actually, it's not worth quite that much.  I shall give you fourteen and a half love dollars if you leave a comment on my blog at least once a fortnight.  Thanks, darlings!  Vale! *~Jools~*
