But the way some people make me feel, they make me think it's a bad thing. There's probably not much I can do about it anyways; why dwell on it? Because that's what Kath does.  Anyway, I talked to Fraser the other day, I think we're going to do something this week but I'm not too sure what. Maybe we'll have a picnic, and I can tell him my... "news" then. I really can't wait to see him though, he makes my day. He makes me laugh until my cheeks hurt and I'm crying. Maybe I'll talk to him tomorrow when we go back to get our report cards.  Sara came over last night, we just hung out listening to music but it was a lot of fun. I love having her over. I felt like I was kicking her out today when I made plans to go out with Jake and John. That's another thing that makes me feel like shit. I always feel like I'm making the wrong decisions, and when I do make them, I know I'm wrong, but I still do it anyways. Fuck this. Anyways after Sara caught her bus the three of us walked down along the railway and then got stoned. We sat around for awhile and threw rocks at eachother (well, mostly at Jake..). We made our way back to my house to eat and my dad was home. There's absolutely no way he can not know. There's been times where he's been suspicious of me, but I've never been caught. I think he chooses to not know.  After we ate, we went out again and bought fudgicles. Then Jake left and we got a ride back up to John's house to watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. It's a messed movie, but funny as hell. After I came home, I talked with my mom for a bit before going to bed. I love having conversations with her, it doesn't seem like we talk enough. And then it's weird when we do.
