But I’m not complaining No, I wouldn’t dare I know that you loved me I know, I was there.  I loved you so much I couldn’t see straight I loved you too much And I learned too late.  What happened when I left Please tell me what went on? I was out of sight and out of mind In fact I was almost gone.  I came home early And I rushed to see you I know I saw you hug her And I saw you kiss her too.  What happened to me I was gone in your heart? I guess you didn’t love me I should’ve known from the start.  I ran home and cried I didn’t know what to do The only thing in my mind Was the image of you.  Should I forgive and forget Or should I just let go So many answers I just didn’t know  But you said you were sorry And you kissed me goodbye See I couldn’t lose you I would rather have died  So I took you in And I never learned That you were a fire And I had been burned.
