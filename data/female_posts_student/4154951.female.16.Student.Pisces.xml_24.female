OMG my bud Carah just showed me a topless pic of James Marsters... =o9 So spankworthy...      I realise I could get into a lot of trouble with this blog, but I'll gladly take the risk if it cures my boredom. The OC is on tonight!! Yay!!! =oD      OMG, all these other people on frees are coming into our seminar room....aughghghghghg!!   (That was Sylvia, BTW.) We're putting a sign on the door that says ' NO MORE ROOM '...      I wanna watch this DVD Kate burned (burnt?) for me... It's the Beatles Anthology 3  4.. Paul McCartney was such a spunk back then... I slap whoever thinks his marriage to Heather Mills is based on true love. She has one friggin' leg...and she had a baby last year! How was it conceived??? Hang on, I don't want to know.. *appetite officially lost*      I have twenty minutes left.. I still have to decide what to sing for the talent show heats.. Foolish Heart is at the top of my list ATM...      Ooh, I want a Mini IPod so much! Even though they're just 4GB... I want a blue one! HintHint to anyone I know personally who is reading this ATM...      I have Maths next...JOOOY. Learning about trig... and becoming overwhelmed with how much I missed...  (SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE: I want The Wedding Singer DVD!!!!!!!!!)       Carah's playing My Generation on her minidisk player... The Who?  The Who.  The Who?  The Who.
