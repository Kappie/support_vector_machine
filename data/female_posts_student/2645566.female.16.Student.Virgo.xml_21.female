Ah...Mononucleosis...can't wait to get rid of that.   Anyway...I just want to say that I NEVER called you a fucking bitch, Tori. I'm not that shallow for starters and it hurts to think that you thought I would go "that low." Secondly, I'm not waiting for you to apologize. I'm not apologizing either since the only thing that I said was, "Thanks..." and walked off. You try not having a choice in whether or not you are *allowed* to go to school everyday. I WANT TO GO!!! I would love to be able to get out of the house before 1:30 everyday just so I can go to band. But frankly, I'm not supposed to even be doing that. And the only reason that I was mad in the first place was because of the attitude that you used when you told me that I was "going to fail all your [meaning my] classes". That really boosts one's self-esteem. I was and am quite aware of the chances of me not passing. I am also aware of the fact that the STATE requires the school to give me incompletes for the semester until I have the opportunity to make it all up. I hope that you realize that I'm not mad at you and that yes, I still want you to go to California with me. But this is bullshit.
