That's right, that boy that somehow has managed to make me crap my pants time and again for about two or three years. That boy that I never had the courage to talk to. That boy that now wants to get to know me. That boy that is "interested" in me.  Jesus.  I guess I'll give a little background to this Yash character, and perhaps show some insight into why exactly I find him so goddamn intriguing (lest I sound like a shallow teenage girl). You see, along with looking like a Jewish Benjamin Mackenzie (from The O.C. for all you intellectual types that are too good to waste your time with T.V., let alone some teeny-bopper drama), this boy is also a native Spaniard- fluent in Spanish, of course- a scholar, a comedian, and a romantic. This may seem like a lot to know about a person without actually talking to them, but I'm a pretty perceptive person... believe me, one of the reasons why I become attracted to someone is because they have such personality, it just shows I think.  Anyway, a friend of mine works at Chili's, and what do you know, Yash just got the job. So after a lot of embarrassment and flushed cheeks, we're waited on by him. Ah, him. Things go pretty well and we make several jokes about the crazy "Foxy Lady Society"- don't ask. Unbeknownst to me, that friend of mine gets his opinion of the experience, and more importantly, me. Thanks, Diller. Anyway, turns out he's actually interested and would like to get to know me better. As I said before, Jesus. I still can't believe it. Maybe it sounds like I'm being overdramatic, cheesy, a little too enthused... well fuck you. I kid I kid. It just amounts to the same issue I've been having with myself lately... accepting that I don't need to think of myself as ugly just to be modest. I swear to god, my worst fear is that I'll believe I have worth. Maybe I've read too much Salinger and fear the unthinkable "phony" status; or worse yet, becoming a Big Haze (for you Nabokov fans out there) and being an translucent prick. I mean, it seems so easy to tell when someone believes they're hot stuff. But that's what this blog is for: learning to accept that I'm not the same loud Italian girl with curly eyebrows that I was a few years ago. Yash is interested in me.
