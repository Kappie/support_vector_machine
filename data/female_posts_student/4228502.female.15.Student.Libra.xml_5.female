School that takes up all my time and forces me to sit in the little rooms with all the idiots who do nothing and think I'm strange. School that gives me homework and prevents me from being online. o.o So evil. And yet it appears so innocent. Pretending to be useful and saying that if I don't attend I'll never get a job and then I'll die.       Die. Such a small word, means a lot though huh? If you think about it. To die is inevitable, we're all gonna end up dead (another way of saying 'die'). So die impacts everyone, and it has multiple ways of doing so. You ought to be careful who you tell you die because they might think that finally the one person they could count on left them and then they would make themselves die. That would be horrid and no one should make themselves die.       If a loved on does die, its sad. Because you can't see them again, you can't talk to them, you ca't touch them, you can only miss them. And that is no fun, especially if at the end of all the missing is only your death. So you see die is a very bad word. I don't particularly like it at the moment.      Some words I just don't like, if its because of the meaning it makes sense right? But just because I don't like it for some weird reason people freak out. Like names. Some names just shouldn't be used. "Chad" Who names their kid that!? I hate that name...not that I hate people with that name, I just don't like the name. Or "Aristotle" what the heck kind of name is that? Say your kid is in trouble and you have to yell their name...would you rather say a nice name like "Benjamin so-in-so you get over here right now!" or would you like to yell "Aristotle so-in-so you get over here right this instant!" That's what I thought, I knew you would see it my way. Who in their right mind would name there kid Aristotle or Chad, or Bobert, or some other weird/annoying name. *rambles on*      Hem...so now I'm done rambling about that hehe. Not that you could have stopped me..in fact I think that if I had typed out more thought on that subject you would have continued to read it. Yes, because you would be curious as to what I had to say, and also you would have wondered what I would start on next. And if I had changed the subject and started writing about something other than the names. Yes, yes, thats exactly what you would have done. Or you would have stopped a long time ago when I was going on about names in the first place. Silly you.      Its funny how dry erase boards are so amusing. Did you ever notice that they are? I did. You have the pretty colors you write something then erase it like super easy and then write something else and so on. Its so easy to destroy what you did and so easy to start again. I think it shows exactly what everyone wants everything so be: easy. So people like to use them, and are amused by them. Or I could be completely off my rocker..and the only one who thinks that; actually that would be more fun than my theory being true. Yes, I'd rather be off my rocker for certain than be accused of being off my rocker constantly untruthfully.      Yes, many people have told me I've fallen out of my rocker and accused me of rolling around on the floor of insanity. Which I think is fantastic, except they have nothing to back up their accusations. Sure I'm strange but a plethora of people are strange, so that doesn't set me apart. And in truth I could accuse them of being strange and say that I was the normal one. And if I'm normal, then I wonder what happened to all of you? Or I wonder if you just haven't gotten really good at hiding that you're 'normal' too. ;)
