Like if i came upon some stranger bleeding to death or something, that would really scare me. to see the wounds and everything. or severed body parts....ewwww.  But when i bleed, that doesnt bother me...not really. i guess ive never had a major injury where ive bled a lot, so maybe i dunno how id feel then... but i do cut myself and stuff...and there is that crazy time once a month when my body decides to rip itself apart...theres some blood involved in that... none of that really creeps me out.  And heres the reason i really wrote this...cause i was thinking about this... I dont think it would bother me to get Emilys blood all over me. I mean, itd bother me in that "Oh, God, Emilys bleeding! Call 911!" afraid for her safety sort of way, of course...but the actual bleeding and grossness... dont think itd care, really. i wouldnt be like "ew, emilys blood is on me! gross! get it off! get it off!" and im not saying it would make me cringe but id push that nauseas feeling out of my mind and just deal with thinking through first aid or whatever...not that... i mean, in all honestly, it wouldnt bother me. well, i wouldnt enjoy it, but i wouldnt really dislike it especially (ignoring the fact that id be freaking out cause its not healthy to just bleed everywhere all the time). just all indifferent, like "yeah, blood, thats nice." kinda like how mr. mattucci was talking about when people throw up on you a few days ago....though this is blood cause id rather get blood on me. and im probably more likely to get blood on me. i dunno...i just dont think it would bother me. it would bother me less to get emilys blood on me than a strangers blood or even some of my other friends' blood on me. werid, huh? maybe its psychological... i mean, if you love someone for who they are, for everything they are... everything  they are... then i dont think it should bother you. ....emilys blood is just a part of emily. i dunno...   blood...have my posts come to this? im afraid so...     look, magnified blood! platelets! (this is me taking advantage of the fact that i can post pictures in here)
