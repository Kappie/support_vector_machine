I slept really really good in first block, and I feel bad for Coach Rhodes b/c he tries so hard, but over half the class sleeps everyday! Im so ready to be out of school.  Im so ready to be gone for the entire month of June! I cant wait!!! Its gonna suck that Im going to be gone when christa goes to the air force academy and its gonna suck that Im going to be gone on my 16th birthday, but it will be well worth it! I HOPE!  hah.....the band banquets coming up.....Im not sure if I want to ask someone or go by myself for the first time! :( :S....oh well...Who cares! I have to get my letters of recommendation from Mr. Day and Mrs. Shelton tomorrow! Im nervous about my application. I really hope everything goes well, and I get in!! Well, Im supposed to be watching nate-man! If you have a comment, you can email it to me at....valerie_w_06@yahoo.com            Thanks
