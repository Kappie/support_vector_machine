Okay, so in consideration of the words and those meanings. here i what i think of them.  Respect: its a really strong word i think..and its a feeling that needs to be used for often.its something that is SO SO important in any relationship.   Spite: i like this word. i feel it often. well, i dont feel spite to other people, but ive felt spite from other people.its a bad feeling, a really frusterating feeling.  Pettiness: ha ha so many people possess this, yet have no clue they do. i like this word. im going to use it often. haha  Love: whoooa this term is SOOO over used!! i mean...its silly to think that so many people believe theyre in love, and that its the only thing important to them..until, they break up, and their left with a broken heart and a feeling of stupidity and naiveness.   so,i have nothing much to say. only that....its hard to realize what kind of person you are at this age..because of all the affects people and media and such have on you. mostly negative ones..and its hard to watch good people getting into bad stuff. i mean, i hope to god that if i got into really bad stuff theyd kick me in the ass..wait..scratch that..they'd sit me down and knock some sense into me. because...i dont know.. i think people are so obsorbed in wanting to be curious that theyve forgotten who they are and who they want to be. by curious i mean..like trying new things that are bad for you. and getting hooked. and being influenced that its a cool thing. its not. its rotten.   one of the worst feelings in the world is not knowing what you want. its like your body is split in three. on the left side, its a strong feeling. and on the right side its another equally strong feeling, but the oposite to the first one. and in the middle, is a mix of the two feelings...(the middle being your heart mostly)..and..the two feelings mixed together makes one big unsure feeling. and its a bad feeling. because in the process of not knowing what to feel, other people get hurt. because you cant make up your mind. and its either you've held on to them too long and led them on, or you've let go of what could've been.  anywho too much thinking for me. ciao.
