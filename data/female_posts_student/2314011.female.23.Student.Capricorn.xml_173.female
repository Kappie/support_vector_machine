       
      There's just something about bringing 58 pages of typed class notes to their knees in a 33-page outline that puts a gal's spring back in her step and makes the world a better place, if only for an evening.  Finishing tomorrow's reading, grocery shopping, and two loads of laundry helps too.    Suddenly three weeks seems like just enough time to get the semester's tasks finished without complete and total burnout.  This morning, I wasn't so sure.  I was on page 18 of said 58 and couldn't imagine June in any capacity.  But tonight, I can smell summer on the air and the light at the end of the tunnel doesn't seem quite as daunting.
