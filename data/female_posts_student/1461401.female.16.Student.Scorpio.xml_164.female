Then Kevin and I went downtown to do some work on halloween costumes but salvation army was already closed so we ended up just wondering around wearing fuzzy angel wings. Then we went back to his place, only to realize the tv was already in use so we just waited till the big one was free to watch kenshin. I went home around one and woke up to go help at church. Tracy called me to tell me she's going to Franklin Park and I'm like NOOO!!! (I can't go) So that makes me sad but I really really have to do homework and there's rumors of grandparents visiting us today.   Lilly's trying to steal my wings... I must flee!
