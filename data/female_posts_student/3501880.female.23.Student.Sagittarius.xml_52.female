I am doing this list to avoid working on my Law Review Editing job. 2. I secretly am in love with Justin Timberlake, but I am even more secretly in love with Joey Fatone. 3. If I could chose only one dessert that I could have for the rest of my life, it would be ice cream, provide that I wasn’t limited to my choice of flavors. 4. I keep flipping back and forth between acting like I am 12, feeling like I am 35, and only really being 22 years old. 5. For the most part, I think Dr. Phil is right (ducks various rotten fruits being thrown at me). 6.One of my favorite activities is going to a matinee movie by myself. 7. I usually select my choice of matinee movie based on whether there is a hot actor in the movie. 8. Sometimes I wish I was a pretentious New Yorker, who came from a society family and went to Yale, where I discussed High-Falootin’ things like Proust. 9. Other times, I just I wish I was crazy even to be on Jerry Springer and have chairs thrown at me in front of a live studio audience. 10.I am in an abusive relationship with my cat. I know he loves me even though he bites and scratches me a lot. I think I bring it upon myself… 11. I really hate spending money on food. I love to eat, but I hate spending money on things that I have to throw out if they go bad before I get around to eating it or when I do eat, it is gone forever and I just have to buy more of it. 12. I wish my life were like a Sitcom and I magically had a different outfit to wear everyday. 13. I have an intense attraction to foreign men. 14. I have a secret fantasy where I fall in love with a Norwegian fisherman and spend the rest of my days in a Norwegian fishing village in the Fjords cooking stew and reading. 15. I always want to know what others say about me behind my back, but am terribly frightened of it at the same. 16. I am very, very, VERY irritated when my cat chews on the power cords to my phone, computer, etc.etc. 17. I have seen every episode of Saved by the Bell multiple times as well as the Saved by the Bell Wedding and Saved by the Bell Hawaiian Vacation movies. 18. I think Screech is now the cutest one in Saved by the Bell. 19. I am still trying to avoid my Law Review Editing job. 20. I am a realty TV junkie. Probably cause I enjoy watching others live their lives, cause I usually don’t live my own. 21. I like to spy on people I used to know, but no longer keep in contact via the internet. 22. I hate when my dad makes me give him a budget or makes me tell him what I am spending my money on. 23. I think I should probably take Xanax for my anxiety, but don’t. 24. The craziest things I have done were when I was drunk and I don’t remember them. 25. Currently, I am unable to strike up a conversation with the hot guy at school. 26. I secretly fear that he will find as much to criticize about me as I do. 27. I started this list a while ago, and am not sure whom I am talking about in #25 and #26. 28. I buy more books than I can read, hoping that I will get around to them all eventually. 29. I hate checking out books from the library 30. I always forget to return books to the library and then incur late fees 31. Plus, you aren’t reading a book from the library, but reading it with everybody else that checked it out before you. 33. And I get anxious and feel pressured to read a book within in a certain time period when I check books out from the library. 34. Then, I don’t read the book at all, forget to take it back, and get late fees for no reason. 35. But I still think libraries are a good idea.  36. They’re just not for me. 37. I have been in love with Prince William since I saw him walk behind his mother’s casket at her funeral. 38. I have been in lust with Prince Harry since he started doing drugs and hanging out with slutty girls. 39. Mo Rocca is my ideal man. 40. I have no idea is he is gay or straight. 41. I am assuming he is probably gay. 42. I have always wanted to have an affair with a professor. 43. But I could never bring myself to do it. 44. I have dyed my hair since I was 12. 45. I am currently trying to grow long hair. 46. Cause I never have had hair past my shoulders. 47. My hair never holds a perm. 48. I wish my hair were slightly thicker. 49.
