And then there was random sex on a rollercoaster. Wait...maybe that was me. Oh, and did I mention all the heroin? Yes...splendid really.~~   There you go. If it doesn't make sense...please don't ask.  So anyways, today was boring, and tomorrow will be relatively similar. As will the next day, and so forth until I die or something spectacular happens in my life. I'd kinda hope the latter...but I suppose I'll take what I can get.  You know, it's rather sad that I'm losing faith in so much. I want to change that, but I feel so incapable.  Mmk, well, have a nice evening crazies.
