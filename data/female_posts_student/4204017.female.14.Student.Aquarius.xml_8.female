Randomly Hayl gets out this old box of Barbies and we had a blast! haha we are so crazy!           Later we were going to Reids (cuz of Erin) and he was eating so we decided we were going to Chris's and we didn't wanna walk all the way around so we cut up through this huge ass hill and almost died! We got to Chris's house and he thought we were drunk. lol we weren't i swear.           Then we met up with Reider and layed on my trampoline for a while. Then Reid and Erin went "on a walk" came back to my house, while me and hayls were doing our james bond shit trying to find them.. well i wont say what happened next, but AFTER that, we watched Butterfly Effect with susan, jessica, and griffin..which is ssssscuuuurry as hell!           Pretty good night though..          much lovin     Syda*
