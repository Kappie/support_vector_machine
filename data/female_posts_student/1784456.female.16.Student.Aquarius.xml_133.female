Would you really want a guest book? People would say what they thought about your life. They would judge you! Oh and these dogey people keep sending me e-mails. No one usually knows what your talking about. Of course Phil's going to find out! You missed a lot and yes I saw Eastenders. Oh and hey, I can show you final fantasy if you want! It's soooo cool! But you're afraid of the fighting things bit. Hey that's easy! Err...apart from the harder ones like Bahumut (or however you spell it!) he's hard. Oh and Edel is too! And Ultimacima talk about arrrgh! But hey, you should come round and play on it! I've only died about three times...well actually closer to seven. (Shhh) Hmm go on it! Promise? Okay then, next time you come around. Hmm I think Final Fantasy VIII is a bit *cough* easier so go on that! See you then! (Hehe sucker!)
