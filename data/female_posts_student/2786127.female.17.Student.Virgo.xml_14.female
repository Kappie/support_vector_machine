SO the Wisdom teeth thing sucked major ass, I spent all of yesterday laying around on vicadin feeling sorry for myself and listened to my tummy rumble because all i could eat yesterday was applesauce. Some good came of it though, i found out that my friends really do love me. Strange, you'd think I'd already know that, but its been questionable before. Makenzie Ashley and Staci all came over yesterday and brought me flowers and cookie dough ice cream. And then later after i woke up looking like ick matt came over and brought me a teddy bear and some flowers :) yay for boys and teddy bears.  Meh.  I found out theres NOTHING of value to watch on tv...ever...yesterday when my sister and dad left me all alone for 5 hours. I got so bad that everytime I stood up i felt like i had to throw up because i had swallowed so much blood. Yes, disgusting. So i couldnt get up to get my vicadin or fill up my ice bag. I'll even admit that i cried a little because i was all alone and in pain. Hey, if no one would pity me i just had to do it myself.   LIndsay came over today. LINDSAY, on her own free will. it was amazing, i was dumbfounded. Though she did only stay for like ten minutes, it was good that she came over to say hi.   I went and painted a youth room today, orange green and blue. NOT good looking colors together. meh, not my youth room. And my face is puffalicious.  not that that has anything to do with painting a room.  I think...the medication might be getting to me. I'm rambling on about nothing. Soooo...I'm going to go find something to do. something that i can write about in here later. yes.
