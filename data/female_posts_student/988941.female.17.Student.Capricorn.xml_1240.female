Mine is 'it's never as bad as being shot in the neck, unless you have been shot in the neck'. Why? Because I watched a program and it showed someone as they were and then after they had been shot in the neck and it is horrid. You take a while to die, they can't save you (depending where bullet is but higher percentage of not saving), and you die a slow death by drowning in your own blood. It's horrid so it can't be as bad as that.   What about you all?
