I wanted to continue the dream so much... it's not a dream about anything...I was so surprised to find myself dreaming of such imaginative things. I was at lot1, I remembered, with my two pals as usual and I searched my pocket for something...A wand, I think. I was so nervous to find it, but I never did. I felt so anxious, so desperate. I was murmuring spells in the book! In the end, the situation changed back to school. I began to ask each student for the wand... IT really felt so stupid. But it's so vivid. So real... I guess this is the result of reading too much Harry Potter...
