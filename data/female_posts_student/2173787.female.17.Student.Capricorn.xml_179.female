He talked about why during Passover we read this whole long discussion between Rabbis on whether or not we should read the third paragraph of the shema, the most important daily prayer, at night.  The paragraph talks of remembering the exodus from Egypt.  He asked me what Egypt represented and I said slavery, and he asked what slavery was and I said restriction.  So then working with that definition the whole thing takes on new meanings, and when we say the shema , it is to remind ourselves to work our way out of restrictions, whether they are self imposed, physical or societal, to improve ourselves.  But I'll stop boring you with this stuff, but its pretty cool and I can't really do it justice.    I'll be gone until Sunday afternoon, so no new posts, sorry.
