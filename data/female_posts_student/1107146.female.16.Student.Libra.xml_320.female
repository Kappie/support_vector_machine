The session was really awesome, we nailed  One Step Closer  to the floor, and then we did  The Skeletor Song  by CKY just for fun...and um, if you haven't heard it, I really wouldn't advise going to look for it.  Also, my email's really mest. Anyone who tries emailing me for a while shall be out of luck, as mail.com is gay and I hate it. You can get me  urlLink here  if necessary, and I'm going to try to transfer everyone to that eventually.  Whatever. I'm done typing really fast. I type these things really fast, it makes me feel powerful.
