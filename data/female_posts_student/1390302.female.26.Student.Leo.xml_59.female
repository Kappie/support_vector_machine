It would appear that a man by the name of Father Ramos has proceeded, completely uninformed, to baselessly attack Gamers, those of us who play role-playing games.  After reading this religious attack on a helpless little pass-time and those of us who choose to partake in it, I found myself appalled by his moral reasoning, or lack there of.  I am going to start by pointing out the problems with his rationale.  1.) In the first paragraph he condones lying and misleading an entire group of people.   2.) Of thousands of people just in the United States alone, he had sited only 3 incidents where role-players died violently and blamed it on role-playing –with absolutely NO proof of that role-playing lead to their deaths. 3.) In the first paragraph he has proceeded to put down Methodists!  Not my choice of church, but one that is recognized as a Christian institution of God.  4.) Also, in the first paragraph “Father Ramos” condoned fabricating stories and lying to someone, not a very Christian thing to do if you ask me! 5.) He repeatedly calls Catholics a cult; placing them in the same category as Pagans. 6.) He refers to role-playing as the “Devil’s tool.” 7.) He repeatedly refers to role-players as homosexual, drug addicted, Catholic, deviants.  (What an idiot!) 8.) He believes that role-players are a bunch of crazed idiots who can not discern reality from fantasy. 9.) The article refers to groups of role-players as cults. 10.) He also refers to Gay-basing as a method of bringing homosexuals to god.   After reading all of this I couldn’t help but shake my head in utter disbelief of the supposed moral high ground some choose to take.  In light of this disturbing sentiment that role-players are homosexual deviant Catholics on the loose in society, I feel disappointed in anyone who would choose to believe this.  Role-players are simply groups of people who choose to play a specific type of game.  If a group of people got together every week to play monopoly would they automatically be called homosexual deviants? I think not, board games are considered a “wholesome” pass-time.    What about the groups of people who are so addicted to soap operas that they believe the characters are real.  These people who go up to soap stars in the streets and shame them for actions taken by their on screen persona’s.  What about actors, who undertake a series of different persona’s for a living.  I don’t hear anyone screaming that Acting is from the Devil and all actors should find more “wholesome” jobs.  I don’t hear crackpot preachers screaming out at the Oscars that all actors are homosexual Catholic deviants and are going to hell.    Or what about people who shoot singers and actors out of some twisted fantasy that they are in love with them and if they can’t have them then no one can, which is what happened to Selena.  All in all I would have to say that role-players are just something that is out there to pick on.  Something for crackpot’s who hide behind the so-called “word of God” with no reference in to the bible or to scripture, and call themselves preachers, to lean on.  So I say, get a life and learn more about your subject before you go out arbitrarily writing something you have no idea about.  If anything is a cult around here it’s you and anyone who chooses to follow your moral degradation, “Father Ramos”.  ~ Kristyn
