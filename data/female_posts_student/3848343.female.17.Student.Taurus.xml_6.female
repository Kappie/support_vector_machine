CONTINUASLY ...u stupid kids lol..love yas....also my stupid leb friend or should i say stupid  *filthy rich*  leb friend is gonna try and get me a phone...got to love ya...=). In the arvo me kate and jen went to hurstville (birdey was missed due to her being sick but im sure there will be other times..hahahah..certain of it)...where we met alana...dead set we ate so much hahaha...kate made herself feel sick lol...not suprised...we went to get rolls and well th aisan man serving had this severe problem or a twitch in his eye.... kate and i were a lil freaked out! Once kate left alana me and jen went to get a few supplies from coles...who ever knew there were sooo many different ham varietys....jenny needed ham but didnt know which ham type or how much so yeh good guessing on our behalf lol...when alana left us jen and i ventured up to the library (another one of our many homes)..it was great..saw alil eye candy (not my tpe of candy - more so of the asian lolly variety)...we talked with chandu for like an hour and then went to catch the bus which came  FREAKIN EARLY ...we missed it by 2 seconds....which was my fault...apparently...and then waited half an hour for the next which was then late....so we had to ask ourselves  "WHAT IS THIS, BUSH WEEK??"  - it is i swear - never ending!!! finally got home even though i had to walk home with rick, that asian kills me!!!...so basically at home i have done nothing once again accept watch tv, think about  ALL  the work i should be doing and not doing it hahaha.....its a great like hahaha....btw jen and my tape is almost finished so any last things u want to put on it let us know ok!?!   Got two shout outs one to adam...HAPPY BDAY FOR YESTERDAY ADMAN....and the other HAPPY BDAY FOR TOMORROW SEAMUS!...hope u guys had/have the best days out! i cant think of things to write about as my lil special thoguht of the night and this is all i could come up with while looking at song lyrics...    [+] things im i can control/incharge of      my life   -   well most of the time excpet when intoxicated hahaha but i suppose i make the desicion to do that so my choice, my life....just remeber u have choices and what u do should be done becasue u want it to not becasue anyone else wants u to do or be something.     my money  - not that there is much of it at all, but then again thats my fault hahaha   my future  -  thats right i decide what i will be doing, know one else woohoo how mad is that kinda scary but no one to blame when i do shit hahahah   my jenny  -  thats right u - i own ya lol...hahahaha im the one that can MAKE HER LATE, all my fault hahaha and can tell her what to do - even tho i think she controls my life more then i so hers = S hahaha...     [+] things on my mind      nothing  -  i think thats a problem, i cant think of anything to write about or of anything actually going thru my head haha...scary lol   ppl being involved instuff that they shouldnt   -     i guess i can think of something. i hate it when certain people are involved in part of my life that i wish they werent....not that i hate them or anything but i just wish they didnt get involed in stuff....cant help it tho haha   what to do  -  do i try or not, too hard to think...let me ask u...u have two options one where u know that if u do it u might regret it further down the track but it will make life so much simpler for now or even for a while....the other is the second choice where u can do soemthing that will cause u to feel stressed and possibly have to go through the whole situation again and agian and again which just gets draining...what would u do?...let me know     the past  -  if things had been different a while back and i mean liek a year ago, where would u be today...often gos through my head but then i think WAT THE HELL AM I DOIN??...u cant change the past, its not possible..i actually dont see why people think about it sooo much because its gone and nothign can change it lol...kinda funny really..we dwell on stuff we cant change, maybe thats just so we dont ahve to face the things we can lol (how profound hahahah).. well anyway i think thats enough for tonight guys....heres a quote again     "....You'll change your mind come monday and turn your back on me. You'll take your steps away with hesitance. Take your steps away from me. I'm making my peace, making it with distance. Maybe that's a big mistake....."            CHECKYAS LATERS...MWA
