It feels like the end of a party when there's only a bunch of stragglers left, good friends mostly, and we all just sit around and talk about politics or films or careers, etc. before getting our asses home...  But last night I said something that I wanted to elaborate on because I don't think I got my point across well enough.  I commented that, as the consummate spoken word fan, I have been to a lot and have seen a lot - good, bad, what-have-you.  I said that the main reason people go to a slam or a poetry reading is to be entertained.  However, I feel that some of the panel members thought that I expected them to put on a minstrel show when they are pouring their hearts out... Not true.  My point was just that if a poet CHOOSES to get up on stage, it is their responsibility to try and give me a good show.  Whether that be making me laugh or making me cry, it doesn't matter.  If your words are incredible, but your performance is boring, I will be bored.  If I already have read your work and I know its incredible, then it won't really matter because I am already a fan of yours.  There was also a discussion about poets who manipulate by writing pieces that are not truthful.  Taylor and Bassey argued back and forth as to the fact that she demands more honesty and integrity from a poet vs. other art forms.  I agreed with her on this point.  If you love a poem and then find out that something a poet wrote about really didn't happen to them, it makes you like them that much less.  However, its a hard call...if a poet prefaced their poem with something, it would really depend on what they said, because if they stated straight out, "this didn't happen to me, I just made it up." vs. "I sat in my friend's classroom and witnessed her with the kids.  I wrote this  as  her." I would give more or less credibility and respect accordingly.  Then again, Steve pointed out that if it DIDN'T actually happen to the poet, wouldn't the fact that he/she was able to evoke so much from the audience make them THAT much better of a writer?  It's something to think about.  I can tell you right now, though...now that I know that about the one poet 'shouted out' last night, I don't like him so much anymore.  hmmph.  --------------------------------  After the show, I was talking to someone who said that I was a bit of an anomaly because I have always been a fan ONLY and never got up on stage.  It seemed as though they thought it was strange to constantly go to the shows but never have the desire to get up there because I was so inspired to do so...   Did listening to the different poets inspire me to write? Yes.  Did they sometimes inspire me to talk to the writers?  Sure.  Did I feel personally touched by some poems? Most definitely - that's what actually got me talking to Guy in the first place.  BUT did I feel like I needed to then take these written words and get on stage and share them with the world?  HELL NO.  a) because I did it for me, b) because I didn't think they were good enough to share with the world and c) because I have no desire for the limelight.  Believe me there were times I WISHED there were more people out there like me.  I know there are others out there that feel the same way.  I commend the fact that some have the balls to get up on stage, but we all know we wished some people would keep their shit to themselves!  Sorry, but its f'in true!  Let me give you a great analogy here...You have a favorite band.  You listen to their CD over and over and you see them in concert as much as you possibly can.  Sometimes they do new songs, sometimes the oldies but goodies.  Some of their songs are goofy, and some are very moving.  Some you feel like they wrote specifically for you.  You listen, you sing along even... but you don't go and pick up a guitar to emulate them.    Now, that said, if the band had not come out with a new album in years, and every time you saw them in concert they did the SAME SHIT over and over and over, you'd get sick of it too.  Oooh!  Oooh!  Even better, you get to meet the band and they're a bunch of cocky, pretentious asses!  Kinda ruins it, doesn't it?  ...But then once in awhile you go back because you kinda miss it.  And you liked it once, so it couldn't be SO bad.  Oh, and maybe they have a new guitarist who writes some new songs once in awhile, y'know?  So you and your friends can't quite quit cold turkey, but you can easily not go for a long-ass time and not feel like you missed that much.  So basically, to make a long story short, (yeah, right!) I am not an anomaly.  There are many people like me out there.  I was going to Bar 13 almost every week for about a year before I spoke to anyone.  I did it because I enjoyed it.  There are more like me out there and it is the poet's job to remember that we're there, and respect us as not only fans, but as people.  And yes, you will touch us with your words because there is that lonely punk girl out there that needs a little more inspiration than Avril Levigne, (hehe) and there are girls that just lost their father to cancer who openly cry after hearing about 'Gan'ganny's' breakfast...but there are also out-of-towners, and people waiting for their movie to start up the block, and daughters of bartenders and, well, you know what I mean.
