I told my mom I wanted to grow up to be Snow White and "get" my seven dwarfs.  She told me I had a dirty mind and that I shouldn't dream of being a prostitute or a hotel desk clerk (I said after that that I would just be the clerk and watch some arma-get-it-on w/ the pimps). My eyes hurt intensely...damn job applications!!!  (disclaimer: if your business is one I'm applying to is one of the "damn job applications," don't be alarmed!  I still want to be paid to work at your establishment!  Hire me!  I'm desperate!)   Today was a very interesting one...we went to the Southern Women's Show, which means this is the three year anniversary of the unspeakable event that happened which will tramautize me forever...and don't try to coax it out, cause only my immediate family, grandparents, aunt/uncle, and best friends know about it.   On a happier note, the Southern Women's Show!  I got a foot massage, a very fake bronzer (so if I appear too coppery, it's not Cancun for a week, it's bronzer) and fake tan stuff.  As I speak, my face is becoming progressively closer to the color of dark chocolate, which isn't good!  You should see my mom's face...she looks black!!  It's sooo funny cause she forgot to do her neck, so there's about five shades difference in her face and neck!  My face looks bad, but my arms look great!  I'm FINALLY gonna be as dark as u Emily!!!! (chemistry class inside joke)   Speaking of my face looking grotesque, I got this thing done that shows the dryness of your face, and it turns out that my face is covered in acne and "clogged pores" according to the booth lady who wants my money.  Seriously, though, my face looked terrible.  It looked even worse, if you can imagine, when I got this photograph of how much sun damage has been done to my face.  It's kinda funny, cause my forehead is white, but the rest looks like I put on foundation way too dark.  I have terrible freckles on my nose, and again my pimples look bad.  I suppose I should get some face peels and sunscreen.  However, I'm a little reluctant to get the sunscreen thing, cause I had a bad experience w/ sunscreen today.  I got ten million samples of what I thought was this clear sunscreen.  Nope...it was foundation twice as dark as my skintone!  Fun fun.   After that, I got lots of job applications.  Here's a question from the Subway one...A customer's order comes up to 4.58, and she hands you a ten.  How much money do you give her back?  Well, Subway, it's one five dollar bill, one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and two pennies!  Yay!  Well I need to go relive an extremely embarrassing moment too humiliating for posting online...if I like you enough, I'll tell you Monday.  Later.  P.S. I exfoliated my face, taking off all that stuff...I just couldn't bear the thought of what might happen if I went to church like that.  Being recruited by the Village Boys or starring in another Survivor just isn't me.  My arms are still bronze though so don't u worry about me dissin ur tan Emily!
