(im singing fuck her lol) anyways, i know u can take over and get Will, Lauren. B-E AGRESSIVE!! B-EAGRESSIVE!! haha i know he likes u, what is there not to like? hes admitted to people he freakin likes u, so i dont know what the problem is. I think katie is VERY jealous because even though she has a bf and has HAD one, she still wants to be that one step above you, but u know, shes never above you, not even close to it, ur so much more mature than her (hahahaha) and you listen and understand people and that's something katie will never be able to do. It's like shes superficial or something, i dunno. ( i love her to death but ya know..) B-E AGRESSIVE!  Okay, lorne gets home and i talk to him..but before i talk to him kristen has to go and talk to him and tell him that i want him back and all this shit and stuff and im like..HELLO-that was DAYS ago and i dont want him back. his friend keeps pushing the subject and i think from what i saw of kristens copying and pasting that lorne made it clear that he doesnt want to try it again. his words were "hell no not now" and that he as a "little bit" of feelings for me. why waste my time on someone who likes me a LITTLE BIT? oh well...i dont know whats gonna happen, and i really dont care right now. Lorne used to be the first thought of the day and the last thought of the day and now hes no thought of the day and if i think about him its just because it was nice to have someone to snuggle with, i do miss that. fuck everyone who thinks i HAVE to like lorne again. I wish people would fuckin drop it.   Last nite my mom woke up to our gate rattling, like someone was tryin to open it and she looked out her bedroom window and saw nothing (u can see that area of the house from her room) so she thought she was dreaming and went back to bed. That was at 5:30am. we get up this morning and my dog is back in the yard. i be damned..lil fucker mike brought our dog back, gee thanks, she wasnt urs to fuckin take anyways. Just creeps me out that hes been here, hes walked in our yard and has come near our house. I cant believe i lived in the same house as him. oh well, screw that.   I stayed up all last nite talking and didnt go to bed until 2:30am and i figured we wouldnt have school, but u know what..we did...a 2 hour delay. shit. i was so tired and i was really tired eariler but i have to do my homework, and that was 8:30pm and now its 11:02pm..and i still havent done my homework. lol But ive managed to talk to people, listen to music, oh and fuck, i just forgot to watch a new episode of The Real World..damn...it came on at 10:30....oh well, i'll catch it later. Anways, i really need to atempt my homework...nite
