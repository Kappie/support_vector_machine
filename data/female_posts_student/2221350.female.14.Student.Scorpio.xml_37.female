So of course mom was flitting around singing about it when I got up this morning. She left me here with Devon and mammaw so she can go see Steven. They supposedly broke up, yet they still go out for lunch?  Today being the end of something fun((vaca)), I am expected to do more cleaning than usual. With four hours sleep to go on and piles of laundry and dishes to do, a room to clean, and a million other odd chores, I feel fairly overwhelmed. But the worst of it is over, I think, since I've already been in the driveway in my pajamas in the 40 degree weather sweeping miniscule amounts of kitty litter into a dustbin. It wasn't a lot! The kind of little pile that the wind could blow away! But alas, what would the neighbors think about that? I only left it there because I knew our litter was biodegradable and it wouldn't matter anyway, oh well. It's not like I died or anything, just got me cold and pissed off.  I hate AOL I hate AOL I hate it more than anything else on the planet. The stupid parental controls have made it so that I can't even visit my own blog. I've already had to quit reading a couple other ones because I couldn't visit them, but it's ridiculous! It's not soft porn or how to build a bomb I'm writing here!  Isn't my drop-down menu nifty? I built it myself. I also got this thing that will send me an IM every time someone visits my site. I'm totally obsessed with the traffic on this thing, minimal though it may be.
