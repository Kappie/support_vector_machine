What is it about the culture of teh school that makes them leave?  I have been thinking about sub-cultures- trying to think of teachers as more of a subculture. Or a culture. I am seeing parallels with two other cultures that I hear about: the Christian subculture and the French Ex-patriot subculture.   Also, I'm tired.
