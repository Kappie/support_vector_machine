I'm probably going to drop dead any second according to that.  2-story Kroger?!? I'm telling you man...B-wood=the VERY short end of the stick, when it comes to mass marketing. I guess they compensate by putting two of the same store three feet apart. And sure it's not the same, but hell...we would be simply groovy and rad. That should be a part of the new 7 Wonders of the World, then they could have pictures of it and I wouldn't need to keep thinking about it, I could just stare at the both of them and be amused.  Woo, scratching head befuddledly, there's my spot of autism for the day.  Linds, it's prolly purdy obvious, but for where wert ye today?
