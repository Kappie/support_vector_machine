So yeah, Valentines, 3 days away...Seriously, whenever anyone asks you what you want for V-day, just say a nice, warm bath and...some razor blades...HAHA IT'S A JOKE PEOPLE, LAUGH!   Yeah life is pretty boring, sorry Ritika my "blog" isn't fun enough for you. But I'm sure it's pretty homosexual right? yeah yeah, feel the love!   It's my life Don't you forget
