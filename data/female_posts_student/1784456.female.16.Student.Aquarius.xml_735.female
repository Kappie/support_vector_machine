See if you care that he will probably never speak to you again! ...Whoops... Any way, I keep getting these e-mails about serial killers in America and 'FBI warnings' uhuh... I'm freaked! Hey who votes we should enter this Guardian best web blog thing? (For the money of course!) Mmm... but it'll be like people judging your life and my life gets as interesting as a pea stuck in custard... although that could be pretty interesting! Aaargh I put this lavander perfume on and now all I can smell is that! I'm gonna be haunted by lavender for the rest of my days! FUN! Hmm... glad you're feeling better, and hey we don't mind if you throw up on us, might improve Izzy's smell and err it could be interesting mixed with lavander! I'm gonna post this now and do another one after it... yep, it's pointless information kids.
