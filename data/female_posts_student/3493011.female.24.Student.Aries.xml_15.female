Terence..  Over the past 2 years, I've been stuck in the "will you want me back mode" with my ex.. even though I know we aren't exactly compatible but well, I still wanna go ahead and give it a try and stand by him.. but seems like he's the one with the "heck care" attitude, having me or not doesn't make much difference to his monotonous life.. Not tt I'm bitchin abt him but rather for the 2 yrs of my wait has he appreciate my existence.. does he know that I pray for him every night when he almost got expel from uni? does he know that I wish he came to melb to be with me or how much I want to see him but can't due to other reasons.. I feel totally unappreciated.. even when he left, he didn't even gimme a call to say "I'm going home, take care ok and I'll send Cosmo pictures to you" No, not a word I get from him...  Past is past why reck it up.. reason is that now I know how to appreciate another person more and more each day.. I truly love him and is confident of a future with him.. Maybe he'll be frighten off by my confidence.. I've never have such confidence in any relationship due to own life experiences.. I even told Jac once that the reason why each relationship of mine don't work out is due to the lack of committment, I fear to commit... not so anymore...  Terence, you are a gift from Someone who loves me more than I can ever imagine...
