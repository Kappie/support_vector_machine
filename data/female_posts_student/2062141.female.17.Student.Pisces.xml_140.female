But what to do tomorrow. If it works out, I'll steal Ryan from school and have lunch... hey Charlotte are we still having movie day tomorrow? I still have those movies we rented.  Oh wow.. Okay I'm watching the news and some sophomore tried to kill himself at Newport today. I was totally just by there when I went to my cello lesson. They were in lockdown for hours. Wow. I hope that kid gets some help.
