I know you are super busy but I'd love to hear from ya. Any new news about your husband to be Jody? Is he a cutie??  CA is still great. I am an apprentice with a modern company in L.A., taking classes with and from some of the most incredible dancers I have ever met, potencial teaching jobs are starting to pop up, my car has CA plates, and I am working at Hallmark... This makes me a very busy gal! We went to magic mountain (6 Flags) last week and rode some of the most amazing rollercoasters that I have ever experienced.... SO Tiff and Jody and anyone else who dares... come visit and you can scream as if it will save your life while falling head first and backwards hundreds of feet. There is nothing else like it! Totally awesome.  Tonight it is to the beach for a campfire. Time to roast the marshmellows!!!
