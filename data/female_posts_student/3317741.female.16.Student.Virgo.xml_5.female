It's like he didn't want anyone to know that he could be a good boyfriend or that he felt something for me. We had a lot in common. We liked a lot of the same things.   At the beginning everything was going fine, it was as if I was dreaming. Unfortunately I woke up. He started to act weird, he tried to control me and tell me what I should and shouldn't do. He was a jealous guy and if he knew a guy liked me he would tell me I couldn't speak to him again. Of course I didn't listen to him and I continued to talk to them. He got mad at me and tried to ignore me. So, one day after things were calmer I told him that maybe 'we' weren't working anymore, and he said that it might be that we didn't spend enough time together.   The reason we broke up was because I couldn't deal with he's attitude and I couldn't help getting hurt every time he ignored me. And that was it.
