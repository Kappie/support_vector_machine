It's called Commander Keen and it is the best thing ever! i may possibly the only person in the world that has it but it rools. did anyone used to watch pob? i used to! i try to talk about it but no-one knows what i'm on about. it's about this dudey little guy who spits on the screen at the beginning and writes pob.(it's not as disgusting as it sounds)There must be some other mad pob fans out there! wow, bye for now,i'm off to see if there is a pob website!
