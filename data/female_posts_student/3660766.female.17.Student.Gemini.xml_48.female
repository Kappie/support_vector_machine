Last night was almost too much for me to stomach! lol I was riding the roller coaster Face Off, and steve Martin was next to me, and instead of the safety bar, they had a chain holding us in! I was like UH HUH this aint gonna hold my girth, and this geeky guy with zits was like here this will help, and he put twisties that hold ziplocks closed on my chain! i was like UR CRAZY! lol then we took off and i was safe lol, so i praise those twisties! Then my mom being the sweet heart she is, she was like its a sign ur gonna die on that ride lol and she thought it was funny, but im scared now lol I think im gonna keep my fat ass on the ground and stay away from rides this sunday. Alls i know is that rara and i are gonna be having a kickass time at the water park! : )
