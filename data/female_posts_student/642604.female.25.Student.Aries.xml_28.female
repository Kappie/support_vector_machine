But then I went to this huge flea market with Jess and by the time I met up with Eric to practice for this audition tape at three something I was exhausted and so not looking forward to that night.  I was going back and forth about telling him and finally I mentioned that maybe we could do something that wasn't so expensive or time consuming and I was waiting for him to be all sad about it, but turns out he was trying to think of a way to say something about it to me.  Cracks me up.  So we ended up going to see Pirates of the Carribean... which was so much fun... and when we were leaving we were SOOOO excited about the fact that on a Saturday night we were going to be in bed before three or four a.m.  How retarded are we?   Most people get all excited about going OUT to bars and clubs on a Saturday night and we were so excited to be skipping that.
