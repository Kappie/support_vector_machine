I try to be supportive and listen to him when he needs it but there is only so much you can do from in front of your computer screen. You have to find a way to pour all of your sympathy and love into the words you type. For me finding the right words is very tough. I just feel that words are so useless when you know all the other person really needs is a hug and a kiss, or even someone just to sit there and listen to your problems.   It turns out that the case of the missing husband was solved early this morning when I logged in online and found Jesse logged into Yahoo Messenger. I asked him what had happened to him and he told me he wasn’t online because they had him doing guard duty and he had a few days off in there too, which means he usually doesn’t log on when he has days off. I thought he had been in Doha but it turns out he was at Navistar.   It is always amazing to see what idle minds come up with when there is no one to tell you otherwise.
