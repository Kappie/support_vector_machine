Very odd if you ask me.  I like the traditional dinner and a movie I think.  However I have also noticed there is a casual nature in kissing here.  It is not uncommon for a boy/girl to kiss more than one person in a night....and it isn't uncommon for those that they kiss to be friends and think nothing of it.  Quite odd.  Just a random observation I thought I would share.
