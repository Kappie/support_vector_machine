Not that I have much jewelry and not that my jewelry is that expensive, but for some reason my mom wanted it all appraised.  I didn't mind.  Any chance I have to go to the jewelers and try on rings is good with me.  So anyway of course when I'm there, I try on some pretty gems.  My first choice started at a little over 1000 and gradually made its way to 6000.  As my mom says, I have a good eye for expensive jewelry! She taught me well!  Anyway after I tried on the rings I liked, the jeweler showed me one more.  This ring wasn't any old ring.  It had to be kept in a safe because it was 175,000.  Now why he offered to show us the ring and why he offered to let me try it on, god only knows.  But I will say, that is the first and the last time that finger will ever have 175,000 dollars on it! The ring wasn't very attractive though. As my mom said, it looked like one you'd pick up at a garage sale and pay 50 cents for.  It was one of those huge rings that Jennifer Lopez would wear.  I think it was a Harry Winston ring, but I don't remember now.  All I could think about at the time was the amount of money I had on my finger.  The moral of this story is that you should check out those garage sales and look for those huge, ugly rings.  You never know what you might be paying 50 cents for!
