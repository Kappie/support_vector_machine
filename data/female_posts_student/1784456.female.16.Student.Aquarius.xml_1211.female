Im in a funny mood.  one minute i feel ill and the next i dont.  its rather quite poo!!  I'm not actually sure what im writing, so if comes out as a pile of poo, im very sorry.  Laura am i sharing a Pizza with you @ Bottilinos still, or have u dumped me 4 Izzy?  I hope u have not. I seem to have written the word poo alot in this blog, mayby i should go and see someone about it.  Anyhow, i had better go and have some lunch now other wise dad will get angry with me, because i have been on the net all morning!   I am still very upset because my Marmite Zippy still has not arrived. :( Toodles xx
