Anyway, had to wake up early today for Flag Day... Oh man, feel so tired after yesterday's shopping trip summore... -.- Hiaz, woke up a bit too early... Anyway, today's the longest flag day ever! 5 hours!!! 10-3. Hmph, I was late for half an hour~ ^^ Heh, today's the only day where I finish all my stickers! They only gave 2 pieces of paper (the stickers). Maybe that's why the stickers can be finished easily. Hiaz, one woman scolded me, saying "Can you stop bugging people anot?"  in a very irritated voice~ I know that that was the second time I asked her; once when she went into Woodlands Civics Centre and another when she came out~  She nv even donated money the first time round. Geesh...Heck, I was, like, waiting there for her to come out the third time so I could  purposely  ask her to donate money so that I could scold her! Haha, but I didn't see her again... Awww...  Gonna grow very fat le! Ate chicken chop! >.  Ast  - Just harden your heart so you could not be hurt by others. -
