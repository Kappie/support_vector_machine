It appears that neither Barnes and noble nor borders has a copy anywhere between here and chapel hill.  Giving up on the idea of getting an actual copy in time to *gasp* read it I order an ebook version of it online from Amazon.  $14 to view the book from my computer screen, pleasant, eh?  Anyway I pay for it and everything and wait for the email with the link to download it.  After an hour of waiting I get a confirmation number and go to download the book, but guess what their is a 24-hour wait time to download.  Argh, the whole damn world doesn't want me to write this paper.  Its driving me up a wall.  So tomorrow I'm going to go buy a power converter for the car so that I can take my dad's laptop with me to Charleston to write my paper and read my book along the way.    On a side note I managed to book the rooms.  It came to $31 a person so I need the money ASAP, my dad isn't thrilled that I had to pay to reserve.  We are staying at the Courtyard Carolina Beach in non-smoking rooms and with a request for two cots.  Oh and guys, I did not reserve your room, the ball is in your court and at the moment I don't care if you reserve a room or not.
