When my 11 yr old daughter was in preschool, she made a card for me for Mother's Day. Part of the card was about what Mom liked to do....my sweet little girls said-you guessed it-laundry.  I explained to her that I don't like doing laundry, but I have to do laundry so we can have clean clothes to wear. Is that what my kids think? That I like to clean and do laundry? I don't think any other mother's card said that mom liked to do laundry. I think I need to make the girls start doing their own laundry-they can reach the knobs.   Pizza   Take out pizza. I am very picky about take out pizza. I do not like most of it for some reason. So tonight was a huge debate about pizza. My oldest daughter and husband always suggest Pizza Hut. I said, "What Pizza Smut?"  Which lead to a discussion about a delivery pizza/porn place-you could have your pizza and porn delivered at the same time. I thought it was kind of amusing.  I know, I have strange thoughts, but I never said I didn't.   Vacation Planning   Tomorrow is vacation. Three days with my father, his friend, my sister and her husband, their three daughters, my husband and my two daughters. Part of me doesn't want to go. Somedays I can barely tolerate my kids and husband-trapped in a hotel room with them adjoined to my sister's room with their kids-is going to drive me crazy---yea for tranquilizer. I am kidding, I will just go downstairs and gamble to get free drinks.  Packing for vacation is a chore and getting ready to leave for vacation is a huge chore. We are totally cleaning the house, because we don't want to come back to a dirty house. Packing, I am never sure what to bring and what not to bring-so I always over pack. My over packing always leads to some type of drama in my house -do we really need to bring that?-what is that for?-why are you ironing that it will just get wrinkled in the suit case?-don't they have shampoo?-don't they have pillows?-  It seems everytime my husband and I have to go somewhere we always get into an argument. I don't know why. It is always about stupid stuff too. So I remind him, stay calm because we always argue before a trip. He doesn't, I react and we are off to a great start. I wonder what will happen tomorrow.   Soap Operas     Why do I watch them when I know they aggravate me? I started watching The Bold and The Beautiful years ago and quit watching it. Recently I started again, because my oldest daughter started watching it during her summer break. It totally pisses me off-I yell at the TV! What is wrong with these people and why doesn't that 17 yr old who is dating a 30 yr old close her mouth. I mean really close her mouth and lips together. She looks like a total mouth breather. Are her porcelain veneers too big for her to close her mouth? Her teeth are huge. That is grounds for malpractice in my book. She reminds me of a skeleton-you know how they look -all teeth and bones.  The dating issue-although they are not "doing it"- what the heck does a divorced older guy have in common with a high school student? Ick.  Can I just say, for anyone who watches this show-who died and made Ridge the God of the Show? Smug, arrogant, a-hole is what he is....my husband says that is because he is a good actor that he can make you believe that-I don't know, I would rather think that the actor is just a jerk-not really, but could you imagine someone like that? Actually, I have. Not a good time.  I think I need blood pressure meds everytime I watch that show. Maybe I should just quit watching....but I can't. It sucked me in and won't let me go.
