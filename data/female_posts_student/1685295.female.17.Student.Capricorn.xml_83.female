On the up side, the man running the gas station told me I could have the cat - thanks, thanks a lot.                       I hate men.  Well, okay, I don't.  And no, I don't hate *you* guys, so don't get mad.  I hate. . . .that I'm paranoid that a guy's hitting on me everytime he talks to me.  And I hate brownnosers . . .stupid men.  Anyone see tonight's theme? ^_^   Kisses!
