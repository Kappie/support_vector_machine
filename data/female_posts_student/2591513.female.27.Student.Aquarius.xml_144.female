I have learned and am still learning just how effective this really is.  More chances than none you will see that whatever it is can somehow be resolved.  It is too sad in life when we carry disdain in our lives because if we were to die tomorrow wouldn't you like to leave with things resolved.  I know that when I die that all my past conflicts are resolved and that I am able to leave memories of love and happiness and not the ugliness that may have clouded my past.  This is a lesson still being learned and I can tell you now, it is a hard one, but it is a very rewarding task.  I have a few bridges to mend witha few people and I hope it goes well.
