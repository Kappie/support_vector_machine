When my dad goes out of town, it's time for us to fend for ourselves.  I hate fastfood! I love sit-down dinners! That's something I really miss about Chad's family.  His mom loved to cook, and fortunately enough for me, I love to eat. And it was good food...I don't think I ever ate the same thing twice over there.  Anyway, I'm gonna go try to make it easier on my mom and help her out with the homemade hamburgers and french fries.
