I dunno just everything seems to be gonig well at the moment. Scares me about when its going to go downhill...but honestly i deserve a longer happy days because i've had shitty times for like 3 months straight. Anyways yeah....theres one really cute guy in my class...i think his name is Mark...and yeah, he's a cutie:) and another guy that sits behind me and is quite cute...i think the main reason why i like him is cause he remindes meof the chris i made out with at the bowling alley...and yeah....he's a rocker type of guy....got the huge shaggy hair....more hair than sabz for gods sake! lol but yeah...the guys are awsome...the other people are awsome too...anyways yes...tomorrow...it seems as if Sabz has a date which i must attend also to see if i like this kid...but i can already tell you now that i don't....i'm just going for my dear sabz...then after that i'm going to go and get my hub cap for my car...and hopefully go back to Senca and get it put back on properly....so yea....i guess we shall see shant we? :) Meh....i really need to ACTUALLY go to the gym some time soon...getting that "i'm feeling fat" again....so oui....i actually need to go to the gym :) bah i must leave now and type up my english crap!
