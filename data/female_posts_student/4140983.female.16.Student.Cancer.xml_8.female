Keep on smiling! :)  Love ya,  Tara   It's crap like that that makes me happy to have friends. I'm a complete PDA person. Not in the "tongue down my throat" variety, but just...the knowledge that somebody thinks I'm awesome.  Amendment to the previous: I respect Tara's choices, but I don't support them. That's a more accurate statement.
