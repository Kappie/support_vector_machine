Mood swings suck, but I am told that "That's just the hormones." Sometimes it's nice to always have excuses like that to fall back on. I'm getting kind of nervous/excited for school because it starts soon, and I guess it's kind of scary this year because of the whole highschool thing.  But I'm kinda trying to convince myself that I'll be fine, but as I am, according to my brother, parents, and friends dyslexic with directions it's hard to believe that I won't get lost less than ten times. Does that sentence make sense?? Oh well...it doesn't matter. So I'm also trying to convince myself that just because He's going to Handsworth doesn't mean I'll never see him again, but it's like even if I do what the hell do I say?? "Hi! I haven't seen U since like June, but do U wanna go out sometime?" I think not.  Am I being obsessive?? I took this personality disorder test online that was supposedly written by proffessionals and everything and I'm 40% obsessive compulsive. I'm 60% schizotypal too, whatever that means. The rest I was like five percent. But, what the hell do these supposed "proffessionals" know about me? Nothing.  But I guess they're on the same level as almost everyone else out there...I'm talking in circles, aren't I? Sorry...I'll try to stop that...OK, that's all for now! P.S. It's so good to be back in the city...I just had to write that... :D
