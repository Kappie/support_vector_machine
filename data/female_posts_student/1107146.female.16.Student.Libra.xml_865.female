I have a friend that found one and has become very, very proud of it...actually, it's kind of scary how much he cherishes five cents. I hope you had a good confirmation! Linds, why were you freaking out?  Wow, nobody posts anymore. Like, really, not at all. I haven't checked Linds's yet, but I'm going to go out on a limb and make a big guess about the status over there.  I hate me.
