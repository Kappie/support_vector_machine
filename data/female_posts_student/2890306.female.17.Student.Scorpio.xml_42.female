I went to Melissa Huntsinger's birthday party and had the best time I'd been through in a long while.  My friends are...unspeakably amazing.  On another great note, I made a new friend too.  His name is Drew, he's DK's nephew, and he looks exactly like John Mayer (hi Nick!).  Needless to say I got a picture with him in it.  I mean... well, do I have to explain that one?  Haha.  Thanks also to Geoffrey for letting me share his yummy lemonade blueberry Guzzler thing.  It made me feel summery.  Thanks to Stephanie Tschetter for having long nails and shoving them into the pile.  (PAIN!!)  Thanks to Melissa herself for being such a gracious host.  We're a family, guys.  Some people never find theirs.  I feel so lucky!  Oh one more thing...   WE ARE SENIORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
