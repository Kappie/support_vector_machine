Was a memorable one. I remember I was trying to do my english hwk, but I couldn't. 'Cuz like how many guys were sitting around me, trying to look at my things. And that stupid child, he always moved my bag so that he could sit beside me. My, that was awkward. Bleh. Didn't pay attention. Just went on w/ my english hwk. I remember, that was a stupid assignment. Didn't really get to finish it, tho. Stupid people. They were so disruptive. Couldn't get any work done. My, my, those were the days. Talked a lot back then, but now, we don't really. Bleh. Elemantaryness, whatever. Hmmm, grade nine passed by fast. I guess I did have a lot of fun. A hell of a lot. September  -  crazy month. Some birthdays, yuck, heh. October  -  halloween, didn't dress-up. Altho ricardo told me he'd give me $5 if I'd be a oompa loompa in grade ten, hmm, still have to think about it. November  -  poppy song! Loved that song, heh. Interms. Shoot. Bleh, did pretty well. Got ones and twos, not threes! December  -  wasn't in canada for most of the time. Bleh. Shots. Then philippinesness. Woohoo. That was relaxing. Loved it. My, I'd go back, but I love canada too much, heh. January  -  still in philippines. Came back. Mid-terms. Sucked. Bleh. Have to study a hell of a lot in grade ten. Musn't slack off anymore. February  -  passed quickly. I wonder why..*rolls eyes* Valentine's day, was that even celebrated? Hah, don't remember. March  -  passed quickly. Spring break and celtic spirit week. Laughed quite a lot during the month of march. April  -  my bday month! Birthday was on a school day. He sang. Other people sang. Craziness. My bday party. Bowling. Fun. Gonna have another one, heh. May  -  passed quickly. Lots of field trips. June  -  passed so freak ass quickly. Card playing in phys. ed and math classes.
