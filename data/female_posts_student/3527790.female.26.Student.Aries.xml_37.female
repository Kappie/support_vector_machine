Now those who know me know that I don't have a problem with peaking and talking in a social situation BUT when I have to speak in public especially when I am supposed to sound educated I GET extremely nervous.  I just finished presenting at a journal club of which I am a member. What a great experience. I mean the article that I presented was not all that challenging but just getting up infront of a small group of people and having to speak in an educated manner. The best thing is the practice that it gives you in answering questions. Thinking on your feet. I truly enjoyed myself. I got told by everyone that I did a good job, how much stock I put in that...Doesn't really matter. What is more important to me is by the end of the presentation I felt more comfortable answering questions about the article even though it is not in my area of specialty. I can't wait until have have my data a little bit further along then I'll present again and get some feed back on my data!  I'm about to head off to a BBQ so even though I'm pretty tired from my workout yesterday. I'm having a good day! And I think I've decided to do the race (Belwood) this coming weekend. hehehe! I love racing! It is a 1km swim so that will be good experience for me to build up to the 1.5km swim at the Thousand island tri on Aug 22!!
