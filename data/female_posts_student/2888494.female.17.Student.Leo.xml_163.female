The service was wretched, but the atmosphere was charming and the food was positively succulent. I then watched “Somethings got to give”, and have landed at the intelligent conclusion that Jack Nicholson is the perfect dirty old letch, while Diane Keaten is an idiot who, for some bizarre, unknown reason, comes off as witty to most.
