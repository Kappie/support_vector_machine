YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. big brother is back! i fucking LOVE that show. i've been watching it religiously for the past 2 summers. that show kicks ass. anywho, while we're on the topic of television, i'm gonna rant about jeopardy. well, not so much the  show  as the  people . but first, i need some more water...ok. all better now. so, if you've watched jeopardy in the past 24 days, there's this one guy. i think today was his 25th day. the dude's got like, close to $800,000. this guy. is such a nerd. just looks like a big mama's boy. and there's things he does EVERY DAY that makes me want to STAB him. at the beginning of the show where they're like "this is suzie from whatever, bob, and our returning champion, ken jennings (that's his actual name, not a random one, lol) who's total prize winning cash totals $755,069 (or whatever it is)" anyway, at this part, he always SMILES and SHAKES HIS HEAD. it bothers the blue hell out of me. i was telling my mom about this today and like, 5 seconds after i finished explaining to her, alex trebek pointed out the EXACT SAME THING. it was  really  creepy. and so is alex trebek. (is it alex, or alek?) anyway...and another thing, is when he selects a category, "cheese for $600" or whatever, he always tilts his head. he looks like a fucking DOG when he does it. ahh he's just really creepy. watch it and you'll see what i mean. jeopardy's on weekdays 5:30pm on channel 6 i think.  so yeah. yesterday i basically did nothing. yeah. oh wait. no. i went driving for like 20 minutes. it was awesome. lol. but anyways i'ma header. later.  -joebie
