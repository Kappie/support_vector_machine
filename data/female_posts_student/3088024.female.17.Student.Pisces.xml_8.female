Maybe I am sheltered or overprotected, but I was never just dropped at the mall to "hang out".  Actually, I wasn't even dropped off to shop until I got my first job.  My parents theory was if I was spending their money it would not just be given to me to wander around the mall by myself and shop at 12 years old.  All these little girls, with no clothes on walking with their backs arched(if you GMD) looking for boyfriends.  All these little boys, dressed up like they thugs with the baggy pants and the bling bling, limping around trying to attract a girl.  Little girls, find a healthy young boy that can walk right whose pants fit.  Little boys, get a girl who wants to get married and keep her body for the two of you.  You may find it attractive when you're in the mall holding hands walking, but if she is wearing some low rise pants and a halter top she is advertising that she is availible for another guy.  I don't know if this is the case at all malls but whenever Kevin and I go to Searstown, all these little girls are walking around with thongs on the outside of their pants trying to get noticed. Gonna get noticed by a rapist is whats gonna happen.  Do their parents drop them off like that?  Do they put them on when they get to the mall?  Parents, when you pick your kids up from the mall, ground them.  It is safe to assume that since you were enough of an idiot to drop your little girl or boy off at the mall for 4 hours, they inherited the idiocy.
