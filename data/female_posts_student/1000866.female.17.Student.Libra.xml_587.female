I just finished watching American Idol. I think I'm like...addicted or something. It is a great show though. anyway, this guy sang this song that totally took me back to my seventh grade days. I think I'll put it in here for...reminiscing purposes. Haha. It's such a bad song but I used to LOVE it. Plus it was the first, song I had a with a "boyfriend." A seventh grade boyfriend but a boyfriend nonetheless. I felt so cool...  It's undeniable That we should be together It's unbelievable  How I used to say that I'd fall never  The basis is need to know If you don't know just how I feel Then let me show you now that I'm for real If all things in time, time will reveal Yeah....  One, you're like a dream come true Two, just wanna be with you Three, 'cause it's plain to see that you're the only one for me And four, repeat steps one through three Five, make you fall in love with me If ever I believe my work is done, then I'll start back at one Yeah...  It's so incredible the way things work themselves out And all emotional once you know what it's all about And undesirable for us to be apart Never would've made it very far 'Cause you know you've got the keys to my heart  'Cause one, you're like a dream come true Two, just wanna be with you Three, "cause it's plain to see that you're the only one for me And four, repeat steps one through three Five, make you fall in love with me If ever I believe my work is done, then I'll start back at one  Say farewell to the dark night I see the coming of the sun I feel like a little child Who's life has just begun You came and breathed new life Into this lonely heart of mine You threw out the lifeline just in the nick of time....  Haha, so....while I was dl'ing this song to remember the old days, I was thinking of other classic seventh grade dance songs. Yeah Barbie Girl!!!  Come on barbie, lets go party! :)  OK, I'm done, I swear.   Wow. This song has some unbelievably dirty lyrics...  Haha. OK, now I'm really done. I promise. I should probably go do homework or something constructive. Yeah....  .
