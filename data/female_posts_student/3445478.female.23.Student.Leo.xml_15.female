I love when a book can transport you to another time...to become so involved with the book and characters that their emotions become tangible. Ahhhhhh! Good Book. Today was beautiful! I set up Nick's swing outside our back door and actually got to lay out for almost an hour! Nick slept basically slept through the night!~He got up around 1 but the pacifier worked its magic and put him to sleep until 5. Then we both slept until 9!!! Lucky us. We went on a long walk today, too. He also had tummy time and only fussed for 5-10 minutes before falling asleep on his  left  side which is great. Nick turns his head to the right when he sleeps and just in general all the time...so his head is now flat...YES FLAT on the right side. All the time I can get him to be on his left side will even it all out and make his skull more round. This happens all the time to babies and it will go back to normal...I hope ;) In August, Shawn  I are going to Valleyfair for his work picnic! I am so excited. I  love  rides!!! The faster the better.  Nick and I miss Shawn a lot. He both got used to having him home. I found out yesterday ( it's been on the news too) that Shawn will be going to Iraq from May 1st until Aug 30th next year. After that, he'll be home for good!!! No more leaving!!! Thank God!!! At least next summer, I will be busy with Skills  all  summer long! But, Shawn will miss my graduation. =(
