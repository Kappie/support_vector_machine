I only just started work a few days ago and I didn't really feel right about taking the morning or the whole day off. I didn't really do that much work today, but, still, it wouldn't have been that good of an idea.  But, because I am who I am, as soon as I got back from work, I had to look up who the guests were on the View today. I don't really care for the women who host the view, but I would have died if the guests for today had been people I wouldn't have wanted to miss. But, anyways, I didn't miss much.  According to the website -- Today's guests: The cast of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy; summer gift ideas with co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck; a fashion show showcasing options for co-host Star Jones' upcoming wedding, including the bridal party, the groom, the bridesmaids and the mother of the bride. I'm SO glad that I didn't go now. If I had gone, I would have been so pissed off. And, I really don't need that kind of stress.
