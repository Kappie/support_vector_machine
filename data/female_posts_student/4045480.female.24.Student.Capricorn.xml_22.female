Student teaching is only two short weeks away, and I feel so unprepared. Now, I know I know the material, I've learned it over and over at school, but I guess I just want to do well and I think I'm freaking myself out. This is when the what if's start to come out. What if I don't remember stuff? What if I screw up my lesson plans? What if the kids hate me? What if the teacher hates me? What if I'm just not cut out for this? What if...the list goes on. I know I can do this, but I just have always had such high expectations for myself, and for this experience. I can't think like this, I've been looking forward to this for too long to wig out now.  I'm trying to ease the butterflies and stop the knot tying in my stomach. I really am excited, just so nervous, and I know I have a whole group of people in the same boat as me, yet I feel like I'm actually advancing in my life for the first time, and it scares me. I mean, I've graduated college, but I settled into a job with a specific end point, and then took this crazy chance at being a teacher. There is just so much I don't know right now, and I've always hated not knowing. How will I do? Will I be as good as I hope to be? Do I remember as much as I think I do? Will I get a good job? Will I have a job right out of school? Where will I have a job? I just hate having my life so out of my hands at the moment. All I can do is take one day at a time, one class period at a time, and do the best I can and hope I get where I'd like to be. I've never really failed before, and I don't expect to anytime soon. I also know that I have a lot of support from family and friends in everything I do. I just can't help these jitters.
