Then it will be certain that no one that I know reads it, even if they find it, because they are lazy :) just kidding. but this is by far the most stupid post I have ever written so I'm embarrassed. But if I erased it then all this typing would have been a waste of time. So copy  paste if you want, but it's a total waste of time.           I hate this. I know I'll be able to see him for the next few days, and next few weeks, but once summer is over he's off to New York. I hate college for that reason!  For taking him away. Because I know he'll do really well and I'm almost certain he'll become famous in one way or another , but that's why I don't want him to go. I know that once all that happens, he'll never come back, at least not to see me. It hurts to think that one day, that one person who you'll remember for the rest of your life might or will forget  you or that you even existed. It's the worst feeling in the world--to know that you're not good or pretty or outgoing or  old  enough for someone. Is 3 years really too much of an age difference? Perhaps if the love is not returned it does not make a difference at all? But  the worst feeling is especially when that someone had made you feel good enough, and you only find out that it wasjust how they were to everyone else. Don't  you hate when someone is just such a good person that you can't hate them but  love  them. But then you hate that they love everyone. I am so confused. I think I'm jealous. I think I want him to love only me, and the whole entire world will just have to  suffer--besides the rest of the world already is loved enough. No, I'm not    jealous   , I'm    selfish.    I think I should have a right to be selfish. Yes,  I do have a right to be selfish. No, I don't, because if I'm selfish then I'm really not    good enough for him because he is just always so right, and such a good person. I really do love him.
