"If you're sleeping are you dreamin, if you're dreamin, are you dreaming of me??"  Hmmm I have been so very busy lately.  I dont even know if this is worth posting since I have to go in a few minutes... lets see... Tomorrow is my brother's birthday- and then the day after tomorrow is my mom's. Hm. To add to it, my grandpa is coming tomorrow. Im giving up my bedroom for a week and a half so tonight will be my last night of privacy. :( well ... I'll still get 'privacy' it will just be in the living room on the air mattress. yay. Zippity do dah.  Toodles for now. I'll write later
