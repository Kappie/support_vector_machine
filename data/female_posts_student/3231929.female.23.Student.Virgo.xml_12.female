I'm determined it's NOT a handbag because that would be far too middle aged. Anyhow, my bag is just the right size to fit the majority of the junk I've been carrying around in my jacket pockets - keys, pens, paper, tissues, tampax, you know the sort of junk...  Here's the website of the manufacturers:  urlLink http://www.puresativa.com  I'm a bit hesitant of the some of the 'goods' they have on offer at this site (seeds); but the bag is funky. I even got a free keyring with it too, although as it displays a cannabis leaf clearly on it maybe I should be cautious of pulling my keys out in front of a stuffy old consultant.  Good heavens, this weekend I've come over all girly!  Oh and my elective photos are looking very nice. I think the photographer should be congratulated (I'll be drinking a glass of Pimms and Coke later). I now have a very picturesque photo of the sun rising over the Grand Canyon on my wall (yes, it was worth getting up at 4:15am for!) and a photo of me in front of a Vernal Falls in Yosemite National Park too.  By the way, I finally put a photo of me on my profile too today. Only one problem with it, I was 17 when it was taken, so I'm wearing a schooluniform. Must go, tea is cooking.
