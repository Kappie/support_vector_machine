My excitement and jubilation will all die down after tonight. I hope Amabel manages to sneak in to  urlLink Bar None  tonight where they'll host the After Show Party at the Marriott Hotel. Then she can try and help me get his and Billy Sheehan's autographs or maybe one of their signature picks! Damn, I wish I were 6 years older now. I'll be going to town later to get the Passion and Warfare CD (It's Vai's  "magnum opus [and] a most excellent album"  according to Wai Quen.) that I've been saving up for too, at least I can accomplish more tasks in one day. So bye, I'm off to see Steve Vai, Billy Sheehan, Tony MacAlpine, Jeremy Colson and Dave Weiner. If you still don't know who they are after that much publicity on my blog, you can check out the  urlLink official online website  while I'm gone, or go read Page 3 of the Life! section today.
