[i wish i could remember more as several were really funny, this was the greatest part of the dream.]  we leave the museum and see more of these episodes happen as we walk around.  i'm scared but i don't admit it.  i look into the sky and i see one of these episodes a man ballooned from fat falling from the sky in a big wrapped around parachute that does no good.  everyone screams and tries to duck, and i run into this big runner-type notch int he large hill we're on for safety.  the body turns out to be the father of a person i'm with (different people) and she's sick with grief.  some of my clothes fall down the runner into the body.  i encourage her to go to the body and get over her fears.  we go down there and move the body, which is surprisingly light.  we open up the bag and numerous feminine lingere products are inside, with shoes (some of the same pairs from earlier in the store), and clothing.  we fight over the lingere that i know is mine.  people are standing around and staring at us.    ----------------  commentary  i don't know where 3 came from.  maybe ballooning full of fat came from me thinking yesterday [in lab] about injecting myself with dmf?    why shoes?    chris and i are done for good.  it makes me really fucking sad.  i tried so hard but he couldn't do the things that he knew he needed to do.  he thinks i want to put him in jail.  he doesn't see that he made a choice.
