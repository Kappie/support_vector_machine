Oke well lets see I think i will tell you about my first movie trip... I went to get dinner with Erinn and Lex at CPK that was an interesting meal... while we were waiting to be seated we went a book sotre and i baught tarot cards... so after that we ate and we got some pretty strange looks from people at the other tables... that was interesting.. then we headed off to the movie where we met up with stefan but wait.. i cant remember what movie we saw... plz hold one moment while i ask erinn...... ooooooooooo ya! Shrek 2... interesting movie that was errrrr Puss in boots.... OOOOOOOO Shrek likes the pussy!  I shouldnt of said that :/  :0  get teh joke?  Well at the movie i saw casey and carolyn adn their friends.. carolyn threw popcorn and a penney at us...  so the movie was rather hilarious... and then at the end stefan and lex went home.. and erinns mom circled the block twice while waiting for my father to show up.... and wen i got home casey imed me ad started bugging me about the fact i was wit a guy adn casey was acting very jealouse it was reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaalllllllly funny... and that concludes that story leaving out teh scary tarot cards..         Then the next time we went to the movie we were goin to see dogeball but it sold out and like i told erinn they checked tickets on entering that theater.. so we saw the terminal instead it was quite funny... ethan came along and he was short as usual and got in for kids price... thats about it for that..         o then before bothe of these visits to the movies... i went to see stepford wives with casey and carolyn... that was interesting.... they both attacked me...           well to sum this all up i am have been watching alot of movie lately... i find it really strange how i barely talked to erinn the whole 3 years i was at St. M and then now that we are out and all of a suddon we r friends and hang out alot.. its kool how that kinda thing happens although very strange..
