Like an idiot I drank coffee with dinner, although I could not sleep last night either, and had no coffee then.I have spent the last 4 or so hours surfing television channels in search of quality programming (*smirk*) and it is just not there.   I started out watching Disney channel’s “Bug Juice” which is like MTV’s “The Real World” reality show, but for pre-teens:) It is basically a show about pre-teen and teen kids at camp.  Then, I started watching old reruns of “L.A. Law” on A Not a bad show, although the episode p*ssed me off because a man whose father was a diplomat violently raped a girl and then was set free due to “diplomatic immunity!” So now I have one more thing to be politically p*ssed about…  After that I started watching an infomercial about a tape that guarantees flat abs in only 6 weeks. LOL, if I had an extra $60 I might consider it! I am so tired of my little pooch! Something tells me though that there is fine print (so fine that I can not see it without a magnifying glass) that reads something like “Results are not typical. Likely the only weight you will loose is the 1 lb. From the $60 weighing down your wallet! This means you H!” After looking at about 300 obviously touched up “after” photos, I switched the channel…  Then there was the infomercial for the “amazing mattress!” This amazing mattress was supposed to form to your body shape. (I usually would describe a mattress that did this as “old and worn out,” but that just does not have the same ring to it as “amazing!”) Also, it was supposed to stay still while your partner moved. I guess the idea was that you would not wake up your loved one. The interesting part was the way they demonstrated it though. Here was the setup:  A 25 year old, blonde, 95 lb., Cheerleader type girl stands at one end of the bed in a semi-short red negligee. A wine glass half full of water is placed at the other end. The clueless blonde starts jumping up and down on her corner of the bed while an official sounding male voice commentates, “Look how the glass of water does not spill as Candy moves about!!!” Yeah…I am sure there are a great many people out there looking at the WATER;) I am not sure if they proved any point with the demonstration, but I am sure that many a man watching was happy that the official voice was able to make Candy “move about.” I am sure many men readily began practicing their official voices in hopes that they too could get someone to “move about” for a harmless experiment:)  When you start searching the channels for a better infomercial, you know that you have hit an all time low.  So now I sit here, too tired to clean, too tired to read, too tired to write anything worth anything, and worst of all, too tired to sleep. I guess I am back to bed to stare at the black ceiling again, or to make shapes in my mind from the lit numbers of the alarm clock, or maybe I should "move about" on my corner of the bed;p
