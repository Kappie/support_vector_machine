Okay, to clarify, it was our chicken and it wandered up the stairs from the yard (the door was open) but still, man! Imagine, you're just cleaning your room and you open a door to toss in some stuff, and a big chicken gets in your face and clucks at you. Dude- heart attack city.   I forgot to mention some stuff about Friday. The biggest thing happened in homeroom. There's a student-run in-school TV program that airs every morning. They were having this dating show where a girl asked three guys questions and picked one to go out with; to prom, I think. Do you capitalize prom (Prom)? Is it important enough to warrant that? Anyway, she was done asking questions, but the host had to put in his two cents. He said, and I quote, "If [the girl] was an ice cream sundae,  how would you eat her? " You can imagine the answers that ensued. Everyone in my homeroom started cracking up. One of the contestants was this skeevy preppy kid from my grade, and he started talking about working slowly and sensually, and starting at the bottom, and penetrating it with his tongue. He's been reading way too much porn. At this point the girl was so embarrassed that she was covering her face. The other boys responded in kind, but I was trying not to listen at that point. Incidentally, the boy I mentioned was rumored to have had sex on the field trip I rambled about. Wonder if it's true.   After my entry yesterday I watched TV:  Joan of Arcadia  and this PBS special about the crown jewels of England. (Hey, it was cool, and I did say I was a dork.) Sigh. I love the perfect boyfriends of TV and Adam Rove (of  JoA ) is among the best. I mean, they're so sensitive and artistic and sincere, with clear skin and good senses of humor. And if they're really good they never ditch the girl. It was a great episode, though- continuity and everything! That's a major thing missing from, oh, say,  Smallville . (Sorry, pet peeve.)   Today was pretty insignificant, though productive. I have a pattern for Saturdays like this. I wake up late, have late meals, don't change out of PJ's all day, and surf the web until noon. Then my dad wakes up and tells me to clean my room, wash dishes and go outside. I usually take all day to do those things, and then he yells, and I get grounded. I just have a problem concentrating on stuff like that. It takes me literally like 7 hours to do what my dad considers a half-hour clean-up. It went like that today, but I did end up getting most of it done, so that's good. Since I didn't finish I'm officially grounded from the 'net, but I didn't want to stop blogging after I'd been doing so well for two days. Also I wanted to check for  Gilmore Girls  spoilers on  urlLink TWoP . So, anyway, after I cleaned my room and had dinner my dad came upstairs, yelled at me, and made me go outside. I was more upset than usual because I'd spent the whole day outside the day before and it didn't seem necessary to go out. So then I went to the playground near my house and cried because I didn't want to be around him. I was depressed all afternoon because little things were stressing me out- overdue library books, homework, this survey thing I said I would do, peeling paint in my room. Stupid stuff. I'm good now though-  GG  has a way of curing my woes. Hope I dream of Java Junkie goodness tonight!
