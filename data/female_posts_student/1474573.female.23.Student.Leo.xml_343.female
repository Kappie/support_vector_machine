There were designated days to pick up the cap and gown and on Tuesday I went up to school to pick them up along with the tickets for graduation.  I got my days confused and was pretty frustrated about it until they told me I could either come back tomorrow (yesterday) or the day of graduation to pick up the cap and gown.  So because I got caught in over an hour of traffic getting there on Tuesday, and because the hubby said he wanted to go food shopping on Wednesday after work, I didnt go back to the school yesterday.  (I could have, though, because we didnt actually leave for Costco until 7:30).  Well to make a long story short, I can surely pick up my cap and gown the day of the graduation, however I cannot pick up my TICKETS to it.  Every graduate gets 3 tickets and then whatever's left over from the graduates who aren't actually going to the graduation gets put into a big pot.  TODAY is the day where they take all the extra tickets and give them out to people who need more than 3.  So basically, now my tickets have gone into the pool and I'm worried I won't get ANY.  Oh, and I cant even go up there tonight to get them because tonight's the Prom at Steve's school and he needs the car, so I have to rush home.   AAAAHHHHH!!!!  [Dyanna frantically calls friends who may be able to pick them up for her...]   To be continued...
