It's alright though I can understand why he was angry. I also wanted to thank him for posting all my messages, anyway, I think posting short stories is an awsome idea and I am going to join in when I get back on sunday. Anyway, I need to take a shower because for some reason I smell funny. It is like a mix of sweat and the smell of masturbation. I won't comment on either.
