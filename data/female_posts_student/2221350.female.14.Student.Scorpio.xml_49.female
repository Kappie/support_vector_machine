This is my fresh slate for 2004, same layout and stuff, but nothing, absolutely nothing from 2003.  so I convinced my grandmother to let me have kazaa *just for tonight* and I'm sampling some sigur ros. It's beautiful and islandic, the kind of thing that could lull me into a long, peaceful, and dreamed filled sleep. It's got lots of violins and long velvety foreign words and I'm loving it.  At one time I had complete control over my dreams and could do wonderful things like turn on lights or wake up knowing bits of a new language.((that would be astral projection, for those of you out-of-the-know)) but somehow I've lost that talent. These days my dreams just channel my frustrations and come out looking like a red hot chili peppers video. Except for these love-longing dreams I've been having lately in which I have found the perfect person and I am so in love and at peace and happy that the edges of my subconscious will me to stay asleep. It's kind of wishful thinking to the extreme I guess.  I'm 41 minutes into the new year and it's boring me already.  Ugh nikki didn't blog today. This is probably partly my fault since I spent 2 hours spouting philosophical mumbo-jumbo with her, but it WAS a really great conversation. I get a really satisfying feeling when I know I've had a really good conversation and made a connection with someone. It's the kind of thing that doesn't happen too often because people are "busy" and won't listen because they feel strange taking advice from someone as young and "ignorant" "stupid", "immature" as me when in fact they are the immature ones unable to swallow their piggish ideals and just hear someone besides Dr. Phil.   Shaney waney paney naney((lol)) blogged today. Yes I do still read it and((I'm channeling my mother on this one)) even though it is misspelled you put my last name in there and someone is going to track me down and kill me so could you please take it off and put G instead? But keep it up shoog, I looove to be mentioned in blogs((hee))  Shaney waney paney? I must need to go to bed. But I'm not tired and I have *just tonight* to get my fill of kazaa so I guess I'll keep talking.  what is it with me and calling people shoog? It's kind of a system I made up of hons, shoogs, and darlins. hons are "friends" or acquaintances, shoogs are more well liked than hons, and darlins are the people I like the most. I suppose that's kind of mean, shouldn't I like everyone the same and not rate them? nah.  I was thinking the other day on how my whole persona changes depending on who I'm hanging out with or talking to. Like with Jonathan and jean I act kind of silly and with Andrea I act downright retarded and with candice or Sarah I act all nice and  boring and with people I don't know very well I am either very dumb or very serious and with a particular group of friends I'm very blunt and out there and with my family I'm kind of sarcastically quiet and around boys I'm kind of sardonic and hokey. All of these different sides of me are different levels of trust. How much I trust their judgment, whether or not they will tell my secrets, their tolerance for my oddities, and their personality overall.  I'm listening to Ageatis Byrjun, it's so lovely ::sigh::  I think I'll go a-looking for some new blogs to read, Mary Kate has given up I think, and I'm feeling like empathizing for some reason.
