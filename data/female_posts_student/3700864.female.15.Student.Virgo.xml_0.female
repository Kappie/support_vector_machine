For some reason, every time I try to open one of my Private Messages it  always  gives me a 504 Connection Timed Out error. Yet at other places, such as Planet Grand Theft Auto my Inbox works fine. I thought that maybe I had too many Private Messages saved at Planet Command  Conquer, so I deleted a total of 350 of them. Go figure though, my Inbox still doesn't work. I hate the damn thing. I wish it'd work right for a change.
