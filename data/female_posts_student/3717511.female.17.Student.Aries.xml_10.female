"you know the musical Hairspray?" hairspray made the style. it has only been recently that the cut has become more advanced and has become "the defining factor for the style." blah blah. while he was meticulously hacking at my hair, i couldnt help but notice that his was absolutely hideous. very floofy mushroomesque top resembling a bowl cut and very odd triangular sideburns, whose length  and shape should be reconsidered.   the man frightened me on several occasions. the most severe scare he bestowed on me was when he told me i had hair like his daughter's. when i first walked into the spa the girl was at the front and she had this horribly voluminous brown mass on her head, with flat bangs swept over the front top area.  i specifically told the man i did not want any sort of christmas tree fluff.he had me turned away from the mirror at this point and so i had no idea of what sort of monster my hair could have possibly become. i was terrified of fluffy teased fiftiesnesss.  god, i nearly went into cardiac arrest from the anxiety and suspense. all i wanted was to escape hippiedom, not turn into some beaver cleaver frankenstine mom. gag. the hair actually turned out well. relief.
