In a way this doesnt sound all that bad but when you consider that i havnt seen my or talked to my father since 4th grade and he has just started showing any intrest in me at all these past few months it seems slightly strange especially considering that he does call my sister every week and has been for almost a year now and i never knew until november. But now he has bought me a plane ticket to North Carolina valentines weekend so that my sister and I can see my little brothers and a little sister whom i have never seen and the rest of my family from his side. ou would have thought that someone would have called me sometime  in the past 6 or so years before now sent a card on christmas or my birthday but no. I am going to go considering that there is the strong chance that i will never be able to see my Father again (seeing as thats how war works and to quote my father "When the bad guy shoots, we shoot back...) yes i know incredably hick but hey i cant help it thats how we are. so yea thats my interesting news that i learned I am sort of happy knowing that they still realize i exist  and would like to see me but i am also kind of mad and hurt that no one had ever bothered before to see or talk to me. only in a time of potential death do people start remembering children they abandoned or friends they forgot, but i guess thats also when people see how much they can stand to have placed on them in terms of forgivness. so peace and love ya'lls i hope your not as confused and messed up as i am. i will always love you and i will never Ever forget anyone you no matter what.
