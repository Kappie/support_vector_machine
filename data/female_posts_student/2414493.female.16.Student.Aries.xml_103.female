As we can see by this year's president, that top job isn't necessarily about being the most intelligent or the most capable. It's about popularity. And that troubles me. Barbara's going to run, and I bet a bunch of the choir girls might go for that. Tiff said she'd run against Barbara. And Anna was trying to solicit my vote today. I have a feeling it's going to be just like anatomy: we're all going to want to run. There's going to be ten people out of 42 left in the classroom come voting time, and we're all going to split it every which way, so the winner won't actually be the winner. Maybe you could call it being opinionated. Or prejudiced. Or downright mean. But I predict it's going to be a race of whoever has the most friends, whoever swoons the most over someone else's cute outfit. I know I'm not going to pull off a victory, and at this I laugh: do I really care anymore?  Is it right to hate people like this? Or think that they're not qualified for the job? I don't want to be mean, seriously, I don't. But Barbara only commands those who love her, the rest can't stand her. Anna is a goody-goody, and resentment is audible. Tiff will probably command the vote. Tiff is ok. What is this ambition of mine? Can't I just be happy?  No, I can't.   I guess there's another issue I could be thinking about too, but I choose not to. I left it behind a while ago, and I really don't see a reason to go back except to extract me from ogre status. And I did, but I got a little more out of it than I expected, than I could handle.  I'll write about that later. Now it's back to the piano for some reassurance.
