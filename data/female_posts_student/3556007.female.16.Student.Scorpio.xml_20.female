You went around in circles and at one point you had to get out and walk for a bit b/c there were mushrooms and fertilized in stead of teh veins of the amnimal to go on. but it made you do all sorts of weird thigns when you were on it. You would flip over and I don' t even kno how to descrinbe it. All this time there were words floating around the "canal" that I was in. I think that I had turned into a human by now.   Then I was babysitting but I was in my own house, and I kept yelling at the younger kid b/c it kept doing stupid things and the older one kept getting into its Christmas presents even thought they were addressed to me and Rachel from omom and dad. And there was some HP present that I think was some sort of chocolate or somtheing and it looked like a bell that was extended legthwise. And inside there was some sort of tatoo. And then there was a pile of Reeses cups. The little ones. And I stacked them waaay up high. Well, I think the older one wanted this blue jello with little marchmellows in it. I brought it out and went to put it back into the fridge, but then he lunged for it, grabbed it, and it went everywhere. I started yelilng at him and I was ticked off and I made him clean it up. Then there was some pmna in our family room sitting in one of our chairs who was watching me, and as teh ounger child owas writhing on the floor screaming over somethign stupid and I wwa strying to comfort him, the man got up and was making comments about how this was the oudest study house or studyhall that he had even been in and he left from our kitchen door.   Grnadma Jo was here. I think that this was at teh beginning of the dream. Somehow she was here to stay and we werere in our backyard on the little slab of pavement that we call a patio and there was a set o frisers back there. I thin kthat my mom was talking to her b/c she was going to be staying here in Houston -- I don't remember whether it was going to be at our house or if i tiwas going to be at a hotel or somethign -- but mom wasd tlking to her about joining the chior at church and GJ was going to be the 2nd best singer or somethign. And I think that I cut my hair, but I don't remember if it was me or someone else... I am prety sure that it was me.
