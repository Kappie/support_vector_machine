    
       An empty room All dusty grey A music box tinkles in the corner The notes are faint  And the gears are old But still I strain to hear And, you know what? I recognise the music  It's the song of loneliness  It's the song of sadness 365 days of joy 365 of pain To breathe one breath after the next To live and to forget To forget that I live Once this work is done I dance to the music Like a droplet of water
