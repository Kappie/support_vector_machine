Although school was as stressful as usual, especially when there are lots and LOTS of rehearsals this week. I will have to endure this period of time and hopefully I will pull through. Sometimes I wish I'm invincible and would just suddenly vanish from this world. However, guess I can't... because I'll definitely miss the dearest people around me. hee~     Had an enjoyable GP lesson today! Never knew that GP could be so SO fun man... Our new teacher rox to the max... haha~ although we had current affairs quiz today... we were allowed to discuss in groups. As usual... we came up with lots of lame and crappy answers just to fill up all 35 blanks in time! wahaha~ had LOTS of laughter. I couldn't stop laughing at all... there's this laughing bug in me... haha~ can you imagine... laughing until you feel breathless?! That was what happened... I reached a point of saturation whereby I couldn't laugh anymore already. My laughter seemed to be 'deadly' contagious too~ seems like most of the people around me were affected by it. Ahahahaha... goodness me! -_-''     Anyway, we watched an extremely cute show today during Chinese lesson! The little boy featured was extremely naughty... but on the other hand lovable. haha~ oxymoron yah? The story was about a separated couple whowere busy looking for another ideal partner. However... their adorable kids were always there to cause some distruption during their dates and all... hehez~ quite a nice and touching story. Wonder what's the outcome? The story continues tomorrow~ =P    Watched the taiwanese idol show 'qian jin bai fen bai' on SCV yesterday again! haha~ falling in lovewiththat show sia~ so romantic... *_* Finally... both the lead actor and actress are together... hopefully they will be able to cross the hurdles ahead of them... hee~ I'm contemplating if I should get this set of vcd! can't wait to watch the final episode.... hopefully it's a lovely one. Anyway... I only buy idol shows with a happy ending yah? ahaha....    A continuation for today... had some fun and laughter with the ppl in A03... they are really nice ppl... very fun-loving and sociable. Haha~ guess this class have quite a good repore with one another. Anyway thanks to meow meow~, if not I wouldn't have made such wonderful new friends. ('',) Hope to get to know them better in future...     So so so... tomorrow... rehearsals~ dreadful rehearsals. How I wish they can be more efficient and to stop being so draggy... it's so mentally draining... hai~ I think I will have a super 'black' face tomorrow again. haha~ I'm anticipating the worse... so that I won't feel that awful tomorrow. However... guess with the company of my beloved CO 'family'... eveything should go fine. yeah~ so that's all then... will update asap. By the way... there's something wrong with my chatbox... arrgh...
