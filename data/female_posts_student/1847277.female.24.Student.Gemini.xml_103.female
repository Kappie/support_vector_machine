As long as they stay in that order, I'll be good to go come August when I actually have to try to age and sex them and examine pathology and whatnot by region.  Wheee. I think I'm mostly taking the evening off.  By Wednesday I need a break.  It's midweek, and Tuesdays and Thursdays blow.  In happy fun news, it looks like I'll be spending July in Kenya!  Sweet!
