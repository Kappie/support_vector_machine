The sad thing was, we had been working on this piece for a million years, and this part that we had been getting right forever went all wrong this morning, right before we played. My entrance was being all splotched up, except when I counted out loud, and I was panicking, so when we played in front of the judge, I was shaking (visibly, I'm sure) but then, when my entrance came. I counted really, really loudly in my head, and it came out right! It was.. just really great. I bought a sorry little pin afterwards, and I think it's hideous, but to remember the moments.. I guess it's worth it. Here's a little poem of congratulations from my sister! little foong, you are cool
