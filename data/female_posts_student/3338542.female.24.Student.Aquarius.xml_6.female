I've also been through so many thoughts today about Isaiah...   I remembered bringing him this asian braised beef with rice (i thought he would love it)  I remembered eating out at Buddakahn.. it was so wonderful.. it was like a dreamstate...  I remembered walking through New Hope, PA.  true bliss...  I remembered the first time i let him see me with out my security blanket..(my make-up) and he still found me beautiful  I remembered the first time i saw him wear clothes that I REALLY LOVED... those cute little express jeans...  I remembered the way his arms felt..  I remembered him holding me in the rain..  I remembered the first time he heard me play the piano (el shaddai)  I remembered standing out in the freezing sub-zero cold watching him wash his car.... and the cute way his butt shakes when he's waxing..  I remembered writing "i love you" in chinese characters on his back..  I rememebered finding a piano in the casinos of Atlantic City and just watching the snow fall outside the window as we played piano together.. (i taught him a duet)  I remember gazing into his eyes and getting lost  I remember the first time i let him gaze back into mine.  I remembered what it feels like to sit in his lap and have him embrace me...  I remembered the way our bodies felt next to each other's...  I remembered the way we made love...  I remembered what it was like to be happy..there are so many good memories...   but now all i can do.. is pray.. for his life to unfold the way God wants it to.. and that he finds his way back to God.. because hes hurting.. and i know that he knows the only way to make it stop is to find him... counseling.. for the pain he feels from his past... his father...and other family memebers for hurting him when he disclosed information about their whereabouts to his father. I dont care if Isaiah hates me.. as long as it serves some kind of purpose of making him feel better... what i ultimately want for him .. is for his pain that he carries around everyday of his life to be lifted......  Some moments of the day i want to be angry with him.. but then the reality of it all sets in... this isnt him.. i cant be mad at him.. he would never do this to anyone.. ever...
