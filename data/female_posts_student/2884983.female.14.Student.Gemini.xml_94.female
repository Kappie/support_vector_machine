I cant straighten it or bend it too much. it hurrrttsss. I would HATE to be perfect...I mean whats the fun in that? argh. I'm a fool. I hate males. they should all go burn in hell...yes they should. except Dj ashba and the rest of the guys we have shottied. lol I wish I had an island, actualyl you know what I wish? I wish I knew what I wanted. hmmpoh. it would be cool to have an island. complete with the internet and a phone. and a big ass stereo. :) and I would have smoothies whenever I wanted and it would be sunny whenever I wanted it too and it would rain everytime I asked it nicely to. I like mouses. I would have pet mouse on my island. same with a dragon. so actually I wouldnt want a computer with internet or a phone just the stereo. and the dragon would be able to talk to me and we would dance into the night and no one could tell us to go to sleep. we would sing some odd songs and we would make up our own. and the native people of the sea would surface and turn into beautiful little elves that would teach me how to run on snow. even if there wasnt any snow on my island, they would teach me how to run on water and then they'd clap and bow in honour of my completed teaching. then we would all run on water to the closest volcano and dance around the rim, singing odd hyms to the almighty Goddess. after we were done that we would jump into the volcano and be blown back to our island by a warm air current.:) that would be heaven. and I wouldnt have to deal with evil 'friends' or anything like that. although i would miss krystal, carrie and alesha. but they could come visit me on my pet dragon. yes. I would never leave that section of islands, cause there would be alot of them, so I wouldnt get to bored. :) yes, that sounds like a GRWEAT plan. *nods* and now I am going to go make an Ashba guild.
