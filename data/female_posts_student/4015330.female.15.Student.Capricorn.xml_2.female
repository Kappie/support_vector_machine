So anyway, I was just having a normal sunday today. Yesterday I had Kassi over, and she saw my new room.  I got that warm fuzzy feeling because she thought my room was so cute and was throughly impressed with my guitar playing.  You don't get those kinds of compliments everyday, you know.  It keeps me going.  As of late, i've been sitting in my rope swing for hours at a time, as many of my friends know...lol. It's a great place to think.  So...I was thinking, in the great scheme of things it really doesn't matter if you have a boyfriend or not.  The grass is still green, the sky is still blue, you still have to wear sunscreen, still have to finish your homework, do the laundry, etc. so i ask you, why do so many people my age have boyfriends/girlfriends, many of whom are completely dependent and obbsessed with their significant other.  Some have come to the conclusion that everyone is just horny, but if that is the case then why not just find some random person... i don't know. I don't think I'm going to waste my time anymore. By going to camp, I saw that there are definitely "more fish in the sea", so really I have no other concerns in that department until I'm much older. If I do meet a guy next year and he's "soooo perfect" , then I guess I'll consider it, but otherwise... bleh. lol. Ok, enough, I know, I'm sorry.  I won't even get into the other things I've been thinking about. Soo, yeah, I'll leave you with this disturbing joke... "Your daddy is so dumb, he thought I was a hooker!" Really think about that one...doesn't it creep you out?!       nicole
