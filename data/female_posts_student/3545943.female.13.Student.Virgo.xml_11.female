I thinkk it's a psychological thing.  It's so ancient, so plain, so natural.  No need to think.  Just run.  And it represents getting away.  My true desire.  Freedom.  But am I running away from here, or am I running to a better place?  I think both.  I'm running away to.  To quote  From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler :  "'Of all the sissy ways to run away and of all the sissy places to run away to...' Jamie mumbled.  "He didn't mumble quite softly enough.  Claudia turned on him. 'Run  away to?  How can you run  away  and  to?   What kind of language is that?' Claudia asked."   Oh, Claudia, you and your grammar.  Sometimes you must abandon what is seemingly correct for what holds the most meaning.
