Love without expecting to be loved back... (goes the same with hugs..)  2. Some things are better left unsaid...  3. Some questions are better left unanswered...  4. Don't be selfish.. (dnt be selfless too)  5. Think before you act   6. Trust yourself...  7. Knw what you want (and find a way to get it)  8. TRUST GOD...  9. never ever underestimate the power of doing simple things...    i've been able to live with half of these things.. but i just realized... mabubuhay na ako ng matagal even if i follow only one rule.. that is: TRUST IN GOD...   if you believe in Him... and if you trust Him.. everything would fall into place..     >GOD IS GOOD......ALWAYS...
