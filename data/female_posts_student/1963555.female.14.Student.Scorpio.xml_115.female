She will most likely be drinking, and her "premiscous" friends are invited and they do all sorts of shit like that, but I don't know if I want to or not. Okay flash back time:  I remember in 5th grade I had the biggest crush on Chris. Okay I had liked him from the day we met back in like 2nd grade (he was in 1st) so I guess he was like my first love? and they say that is the most memerable, I don't think I like him, I mean I havn't seen or talked to him in about a year, but I've always been harboring that little hope that somthing would come of us. The closest I got to that was at my Ex-best friends (Chelsea, the one I hung out with on New Years)11th or 12 birthday party, when he was flirting with me the whole time, and he was really into me, they even did this bet thing where who ever lost at the game chicken would get to go out with me. And I vaugly remember him saying "I'm so not losing this" or somthing to that extent. (Shit writing about all this is bring back memories that I have pushed down as far as they go, anyway...)He won, but the catch to this perfect night for me, was that Chelsea liked him too. That ruined it all. See, he asked me out there I remember him calling me over to the front door, where there was walk down stairs so a little bit of privacy, he goes "will you go out with me" and retard over here goes "I dunno" But then Chelsea's mom comes over and tells us we arn't alowed down there, and need to come back up the stairs with the rest of the party, and to hid his embarrasment he started mumbling (he mumbled alot) "Uhh this is a nice front door, really nice door" It was really funny. But I was so over joyed and biting my tongue just so I wouldn't say yes because... Chelsea liked him. I could tell she really was getting pissed, she was so angry but didn't want to say anything because he liked me then, not her. And because of my fucking "loyalty" I said no, he was begging, the guy I"ve been in love with for years, but for "friend-ship" I said no. And now go read the post from New Years, I hate her now, so that was a huge waste!  Now that was one of the many stories, and how it ties into the Memorial Day party is, I remember being in 5th grade at the end of the year and soon going into sixth grade, he was genuanly worried about me, he told me "please don't get involved with the wrong people and don't do drugs" and I remember this all being so off the wall. And now about a year ago this summer, him and Dacia happend to meet up on a camping trip. (A couple of months earlier, My friends's Ex-boyfriend Dan, had beat him up, and Chris vowed to stay away from her for good) The two made-out the whole time. That really sucked. And he was also drinking beer, and I know it's not a big deal but, idk, he was like my modavation not to drink and do drugs, among other things, and then I heard from my friend he was drinking. Now I'm thinking about this party, should I drink to catch up to him, to look cool to him? Should I not drink because I know I shouldn't, because I'm a retard anyway, or because he grew out of that stage realizing it wasn't cool? I don't know. I am so confused wether I want to worry about looking good infront of him. I remember at the winter-wonderland dance in 8th grade he told me I looked like Barbie, and I was pretty fat back then, now that I"m loosing weigt, gaining abs, I might not be looked over any more. But I just don't know how I'm gonna look like to him. Maybe I am blowing this way outta proportion, and I should just go with what ever feels right. I'm just going to have to do what Andrew WK did, (he is really hot by the way) Expect nothing. That is what I'll do. To tell you the truth, I would love nothing more than to go into school next year, he would be a freshman, me a sophmore, and me skinny and totally changed, and he doesn't even recognise me, and if he does, I want him to be in total shock and have him think that I am way hotter than my friend,you know who. this is what I'm thinking about  *Cut my hair short *Dye it blonde *loose a little bit more *Get those Abs *Get my nose peirced *get new clothes  I think this just might work I'm going to switch places with her right under her nose
