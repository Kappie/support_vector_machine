All we'd need would be a digital video camera; there's people all over we could interview, and we could focus on ignorance. You knowâ€”the reason these people are so biased is because they're uninformed.  We could map out an interview, figure out what questions to ask, and go talk to neighbors and friends and random people at the D Eh?  We could edit and cut and stick it all together on my primitive vid editing program. And then we could...! Well, I don't know what we'd do then. We could mail a copy to Michael Moore, I guess. And have copies to show to our kids and brag about.  What do you think? It would be fun, and we could make a lot of people mad!  Also I get the feeling that I'm going to be really bored this summer.
