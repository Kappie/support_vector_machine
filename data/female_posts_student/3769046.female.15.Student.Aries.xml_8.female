I will not degrade myself to that level. Hahaha. Heh, but only now. That freak. Not gonna bother using hi5. Just this and yeah. Think he can just do that. But how do i know that was his intention? I can't assume, I'll be so confused. Even tho we learned in math, to make assumptions. But I believe this is not a time to make assumptions. Only time will tell. But I do believe we need better communication, in order to understand each other. And now, the only thing I intend to do this summer is to have a great time w/ friends.. *Sigh* What is a friend? "One whom one likes, trusts, knows?" I don't really know if that's a proper definition for my situation right now. What can I do? Why does he keep on freakin' asking?!? I should why did, hah. WEIRDNESS.
