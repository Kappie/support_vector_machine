Along with precal, physics has come back to a surprising and punising lead over charles.  seems he has his work cut out for him.  his plan looks to be just to run hard and steady, cutting corners and not giving a shit about any of it; and that seems to be working out for him. thats right, steve.  charles seems to know how to suck, and suck hard.  and thats just what hes doing.  all he has to do is keep it up for another week. well, lets get back to the action and see what charles' next move is, when we return to CHARLES VS CHS in the championship game 6/6... right after these commercials.  lhovhe yhou.
