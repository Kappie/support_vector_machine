It did not take too long to accomplish this with my trusty group of Ziggur, Kretais and Ellektra. They have done their jobs to the best that anyone could imagine and we had a wonderful time knowing that our deeds were the most noble of all on Norrath.  At the end of the day however I received some terrible news. Ziggur, Kretais and Ellektra will be leaving me for a short time. They must attain a brilliant sword called the SoulFire to enable Ziggur to be the best Paladin ever known. This saddened me and for a second I feared that I will be unable to meet my goals of cleansing the evil on Norrath. However, Brell shined upon me and told me that while my companions are indeed leaving on another equally important quest that the Wayfarers Brotherhood still had a need for me and its own evil to eliminate. I was proud to know that even without my beloved group that I can still commit to my quest. At that I bid my group adue and wished them on their way.
