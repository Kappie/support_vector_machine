When are you ever coming home to me? Is it over between us? I hope not because that would be so very sad. I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART!! Please dont ever give up on us. It would be terrible. Thank you for always being there to listen to me even if it didn't make to much since. You are the one that has held me together. You have truely had me from "HELLO"! :)          Well I hope that you got what I'm trying to say! Thanks Honey!!
