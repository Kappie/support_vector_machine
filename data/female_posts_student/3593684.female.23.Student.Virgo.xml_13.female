Anyway.  Today's headlines.  MR. Vince brought me a guitar today.  Yep.  A nice one too.  He's loaning me it for the summer.  His new fuckability rating: 25.  Speaking of FR's.  My personal FR seems to depend on the age of the male.  For your above-average looking 23-28 year-old, about a 4.  For your below-average looking 40 year-old: 250.  I *must* stop going to concerts alone.  I am a very easy target.  Went to see  urlLink Mission of Burma  tonight at the  urlLink MusicBox .  They also ROCK. especially for 40 year-olds.  Anyway. I met a very nice 40 year-old at the show.  Unfortunately, I am not interested. Despite my comment about the lolita thing, it really is a FANTASY, which means I don't really want to pursue it.  Except maybe with MR. Vince.  But maybe that is because he is not into me and therefor does not come across as sleazy or unethical.  Not that I think there is anything really wrong with cross-generational sexual relationships.  I just don't trust most older guys who are interested in 20-somes.    It's like  urlLink groucho  said, "I wouldn't sleep with any 40 year-old who'd want to sleep with me." Okay, well what he really said was "I wouldn't join any club which would have me as a member," but close enough.   Well. Yesterday I promised I would discuss Mr.s David and Rod.  I am too tired to talk about Mr. Rod.  He deserves more attention than I can give right now.  But here is Mr. David, in brief.  Gender: male, but not overly masculine (except in bed, see below) Race: whiter than white Age: 26 Height: not very tall Weight: holocaust victim Religion: culturally jewish (I guess that makes the last comment even more un-p.c.) Talents/Attributes: Amazing in bed, Pretty fucking good at guitar, truly smart, Tres funny, basically nice.  Things I like about him: his sarcasm  wit.  Would not intentionally hurt someone. Good taste in music.  Doesn't really care about what other people think about him. independent. Creative.  Did I mention he is really good in bed?  Things that drive me nuts: He never calls.  Ever.  He shows very little visible interest in me.  self centered at times.    But the only big thing I don't like is that he doesn't like me. At least not in the right way.  Shit, I don't reallly have the energy to explain MR. David either.    If I sound insecure it's because I am.  But that doesn't mean that I don't have a realistic assesment of myself.  So I will end with these observations.  --I am terrified of rejection --As a consequence, I hit on men who I think I have a chance with --As a consequence, I think I am now conditioned to find real hotties (the GQ models,  etc.) unattractive. --I am not, however, ugly, so there are plenty of guys who do the exact same thing that I do.  I.E., they hit on me because they think I won't say no. --If I had female friends, I would be the chick who the wingman gets stuck with.  My friend would be the hottie every one else is after. --Despite all of this.  I only date guys I am really into. I throw myself into my relationships.  I am one-hundred percent into whoever I date.  Otherwise i dont date them.   --I just want a guy who is 100% into me, not someone who is dating me because they think I am just pathetic enough not to say no, and just cool enough that they can stand me.  okay. folks, that's all for tonight.  Tomorrow I am supposed to see MR. D.  I bet five bucks he breaks the date...
