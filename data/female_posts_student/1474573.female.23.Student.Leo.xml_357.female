I tell ya, having all three at once is a handful.  Kudos to Steve's sister for being able to deal with it all.  Of course they've actually grown up with her so she's had some time to get used to the idea.  We on the other hand are almost lost.  Okay, I ain't gonna lie.  Its just me.  Steve's fine.  His teacher skills come in very handy a lot of times...    Like, last night, when the little one says he's not hungry for dinner, eats half a burger but then starts pigging out on chips at 11:30 pm, I didn't think twice.  I was just happy he was eating.  But Steve noticed how late it was, and how the little one was getting away with murder and took the chips away.  See?  Bad Auntie!  (well, not to  them .  To them I'm cool.  hehe)  Of course, I drew the line when the 13 year old was putting his dirty sock in his mouth. Okay, so I threatened to choke him with it if he didnt stop.  Sue me.  Y'know what he says, "That was some fear factor stuff right there!" with a smile on his face.  The grosser the better, I guess.  Sigh.  Today I will try and spend some quality time with the girl.  Between the oldest one grossing everyone out to the little one always talking to get attention, she gets a little lost in the shuffle. Perhaps we will go shopping.  Or maybe catch a chick-flick at the movies.  :-)
