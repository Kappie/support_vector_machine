The following meeting will be on 12 June, 4pm, at Dn Eric Koh's house. For those who do not know how to get to his place, wait at Novena MRT Station at 3.40pm and i'll lead you there. But please call me first, if you dunno how to get there...i dun wanna be waiting there like a dumbo for no one.  Do invite your friends to come along too!
