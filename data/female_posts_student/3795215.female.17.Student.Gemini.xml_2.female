But everytime you tell me it was my fault- everytime you blame I get pushed further from my goal and towards shame I want so badly to be happy and not care That feeling would be so rare. The load I'm carrying is breaking me down I feel as if I may sometimes drown in the same tears you've made me cry.  So many people hurt and I no longer wish to be part of that group. Make me the outcast I'm destined to be. Sometimes I feel as if I'm just wasting peoples' time for being around. I wonder, if I were lost, how long would it take for me to be found? It would be a blessing to be forgotten- left behind To be lost in a crowd as well as in my mind My thoughts confusing myself and others So why be around; why bother? How did it come to this again? I'm falling and I don't know when I'll hit ground I'm afraid by the time it's over I'll be too far down I'll have no time to change your opinion- it's already been made, So, into the darkness I will fade...
