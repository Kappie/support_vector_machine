My frens all tink he's a jerk, an ass but i juz cant bring myself to hate him ah.. only god knows how i felt abt him.. i had a talk wif gabriel a couple of days ago.. he said this 'sometimes when u've bn hurt too many times, it'll reach to the extend tht u cant feel anymore pain' and i agree wif him.. 'Maybe tis will help u to grow into a more mature person and so u can handle yr life easier when u get older..'. Not bad coming from a guy like him.. usually all he does is talk crap.. haha, no offense gab.. oops,gtg. later.       Ok, here i am back again.. hmm, gorgeous wasnt arnd today.. Wonder wat happened to him.. hope he's nt sick or anythin.. school was kinda exciting today(sorta). gt that case abt hui shan's stolen hp.. goodness.. i wonder wat e heck tat guy was thinkin.. everybody's bz(cept me, i was dead aslp) finishin e wishin tree n he goes around doin crappy stuffs.. haiz.. hope its settled.. gotta say tat i kinda look up to red now.. didnt knw he had tat in him.. tat honesty thingie.. nvm if u dont understand..      Anyways, tmr's e sch celebratin national day.. feel so lazy to come.. but i guess i shud anyways. to see a certain someone.. hmm.. wat ah.. haiz.. my mind's wandering back to him.. it shudnt be.. dammit, i hate myself sometimes.. but i'll relax.. what goes around comes around anyways so i'll le it be.. i'll be prepared when i do see him agn..      Btw, i juz remembered somethin.. saw city hall guy(i still dunno his name,he's my old crush btw) a couple of days ago.. coincidentally e day aft tis mess started n e last time i saw him was a day aft i met tat jerk... weird huh.. maybe i shud reli try n approach him..who knows.. =) he could be e one who'll make me forget ad.. i hope tat he doesnt start runnin away e next time tat i see him.. hehe..      And ive dropped the idea of bein a butch(lol). muz haf bn out of my mind.. thx alot to my frenz for knockin some sense into my freakin head.. i was reli thinkin of cutting my hair damn short n behaving like a guy.. but now i guess i juz wn go back to normal n juz get on wif my life.. life's too short to be wasted,dont u tink ? Whatever crappy stuffs i said i wud do were all in e state of temporary insanity.. i know ill nv get over it but im sure my heart will heal slowly over time..
