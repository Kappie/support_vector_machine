He said that he was sorry he yelled at me and that I had been very rational and reasonable and he appreciated it. He certainly didn't make it easy. He tore me apart for everything he could think of. But he's right, I didn't rise to the bait.  And I didn't accept any criticism that wasn't justified.  For once the high road paid off. It's nice to get some recognition.  I have a lot of faults but being irrational and unfair aren't among them so those accusations really piss me off.  It turns out his frustration was coming from his parents being here.  It's getting harder and harder for him to be around them. Especially his dad.  All the critical messages he heard growing up, the nothing is ever good enough routine, were torn open again.  So he projected it on to me and once again I got tirade he's afraid to release on them.  At least he recognized it.  That's good news for my boys.  Those are not coping skills I want passed on to my kids.  But enough about him. Way to much of this blog has been devoted to him already.
