I took yours down too!    Ashleigh talked to me today to tell me that she had nothing to do with what happend last night!  Well, I never thought it was her!  I figured that Ashleigh was more mature than that and she probably had better things to do, than to harass me!  And I was right!  So I told her that and then she told me that I'll never understand and that I'm always going to be stuck up!  So then I IM'd Amanda and told her that I miss my ultimate best friend, and I want her back and I'm ready to change (no more drugs, lying, her brother, cheating ...)  I'm done with it all because it is stupid and I have better things to do with my life!  Well, Amanda showed that all to Ashleigh!  I was kind of upset because I didn't want Ashleigh to think that I'm deperate for her friendship . . . I just love her a lot!  So I IM'd Ashleigh and I told her that I'm not going to do anything anymore and that I'm sorry Amanda told her the stuff!  Well she told Amanda that she loved me and I had Mark tell her that I was trying to be more mature about this fight and that I wasn't going to right mean stuff about her in my journal!  And I haven't!  I'm not going to do that because I don't want to start anymore problems because I love her!  No matter what I am always going to love her!  Sleepover at Lori's house tonight!  It is going to be so much fun!  Yay!
