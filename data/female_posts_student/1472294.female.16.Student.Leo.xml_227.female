I watched LOTR with my friends and I am so touched! This is the only film which I would cry so many times. The part where Arwen is going to die and Ewoyn hugging her father.... Hiaz... So sweet and nice! Sound Of Colors was simple and yet sweet. Really, you should all watch it during the Christmas season. Very sweet, the movie felt like honey. It warms you inside out....
