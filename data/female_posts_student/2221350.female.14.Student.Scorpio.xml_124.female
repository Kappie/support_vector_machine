Soon Devon came prancing home with Lauren and we had a grand ole' time. We all chipped in for pizza((ahem, I paid the bulk of it and Lauren paid a little))((we're pretty poor teenagers.. We had to pay the guy his tip in quarters!)). After pizza we turned on the Grease soundtrack and did the hand jive, it was fun. Then I took a shower and Devon found some old movies. We watched me in my 1st grade play and it was, to say the least, frightening. I had bangs, glasses, and a big bow on the tippy top of my head. Thankfully, I've abandoned all those things and blossomed into a beautiful maiden. ((sarcasm))  mom came home a while later and called daddy, she's arguing with him now. Here's the deal, I want to take a few HTML classes at Centenary((not LSU, oops Nick)) and it will be $150 for both of them. Well I emailed daddy and said this:  hey daddy   how are you? I am positively bored as can be. I was really disappointed when I found out I wasn't coming over this summer and I am rotting away in Shreveport. I think it would be nice to take an HTML((hypertext markup language)) class at centenary. I already know quite a bit about HTML and would like to polish up so that I can put my skills to good use. The link to the centenary highschool workshop page is at the bottom of this email and I would really love it if you would call and schedule for me to take the beginner's web page design class from June 23-27 and the intermediate web page design class from July 7-11. I love you and hope to see you some time this summer. Call me!   Love,  CAITLIN  http://www.centenary.edu/news/1997/May/summer.html PS: I talked to mompat on an IM, she sounds like she's doing pretty good. Keep me posted.   and last night, he replied with this:  Dear Caitlin, I'm really glad to hear from you, and I'm really glad you are interested in the class on HTML.  I wish I could take that class too.  I'm sorry I missed your call the other day, I did attempt to call you back, and in your message you asked about my hanging up on your mother.  I did hang up on her, as when I answered, I was in the middle of something and she was not speaking in a civil tongue and I am simply not going to tolerate that behavior any longer.  I'm certain she's stressed out, and believe me, I'm stressed too, but there's no need to behave in that manner, I don't behave that way, I've done nothing to deserve it and therefore I will no longer tolerate it. I know this will impact you and Devon, and for that I'm truly sorry.  I've wanted to call you many times over the past years, but I have been intercepted by your mother on numerous occasions and I've put off calling for that reason, it's just too much.  For this I'm very sorry and there's no excuse, I should call anyway, but now I'm afraid that it might make your life more difficult, so I don't.  I've been in your position before and sometimes it sucks. I send your mother ample funds for you to take the course, $75 is what I believe it costs, and she should be able to afford the class.  If this is not the case, please call me and we can discuss. I love you and miss you and Mama Pat will be better soon and you will be able to come to Tyler and even Nacogdoches and be with me, so please don't despair. I love you very much, Daddy   well mom made me print the email out and give it to her, which I probably would have done anyways, and it seriously pissed her off. So right this second, she is in her room yelling at him over the phone about child support and yahta yahta.  I watched Free Willy the night I babysat, and I cried through the whole thing. I got to thinking about it, and I sort of cry a lot. It's always weird stuff, too. When the kids' parents got home they were like "what's the matter?!?" and I was like "I, i, I was waawatching Ffree Willllly!" well anyways, that's what tr0y and I were talking about last night/early this morning. He's a cool guy.
