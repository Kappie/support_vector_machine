Except my new Vintage Slow Rock Vol. III (!)    But its on real soft so the house is really mellow now.    I dont care for sleeping. I think it's a waste of time especially if you are somewhere where you're likely never to come again. Like now, here.   Hmpf. Jerry's still lost. But all Tag-Boards are down.   Hello, Shakil. (mentioned)   Gilmore Girls on in 1 hour.
