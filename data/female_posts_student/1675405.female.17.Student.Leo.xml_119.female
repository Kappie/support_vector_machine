I suppose I'm just waiting to be proven wrong.    I am really glad that I've been able to "spill over" to Colucci's pizza this week. Indeed, it is the very epitome of drama-- like I need that, but still... I'm not used to girls actually getting along with me. These girls do!   I'm giving myself two lines this evening to relieve my inner teenage girl rantings: I've finally been able to style my hair where it looks cute today,  and  I ate a lot of pizza; I hope my behind isn't greeting all of these extra calories with open arms!
