Like a speeding car, it passes me by and leaves me standing, searching, on some lonely dirt road called life.  Introspection, as wonderful as it is, can be a dangerous thing. Thinking too much and too hard about a particular topic will wear you down, emotionally and mentally, and leave you more confused than when you began your ponderings. I think that Pooh had it right all along; life, and all the tiny moments that comprise it, just  is , not this insatiable push for progress that the human race seems hell bent on completing.  Right now, I am studying for a final exam, writing a paper, and trying not to pull out every single strand of my hair. Right now, I am learning to sit back, relax, and breathe. The world may not revolve around me, but it will wait on me for a little while.
