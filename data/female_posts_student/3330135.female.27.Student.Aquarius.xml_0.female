And, just like that, out of the blue, I thought: "it's about time we see Dogville". Because strangely enough, no matter how much we like Lars Von Trier, we always seem to drag it forever before we watch his movies. There's always something about "we're not in that kind of mood right now... how about a mainstream american comedy? no danger there..."  Anyway! We took it. And it turned out to be an absolute masterpiece!!! Yes, everybody else said that, but I'm not much for film critiques... I very rarely agree with them. At first, we were wondering what this theatre-like setting was about, and thinking that we'd never get caught in it. But after a very short while, we were like swallowed by it. I got so much into it, and so upset by what happened in it that I almost had to leave the room!! (I often do that... I have this strange ability to really live the lives of the characters... And don't come and tell me "it's just a movie!", that doesn't work with me...)  It felt sort of like a book... You get the story told, but plenty room is left for your own imagination to build on... Pretty fascinating, the power of our own imagination. I guess that seeing a movie like this makes you realize how braindead most of the others tend to make us...  The only think I keep wondering about is this whole "critique of American society" thing. When the movie came out, and all around the Cannes festival, all everyone kept talking about was the strong attack against Americans. But I must admit that I can't really see that.... A critique, yes. A violent one, certainly. But specifically to Americans? To me, this is directed to humankind generally...
