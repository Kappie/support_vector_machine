(Nick.. your probally gunna get so shitty...every ones taking your idea!! Haha ohh well, I'm giving you credit for the idea so be happy!!)   So today was pretty awesome, Madi and I hung out for a while and then headed to coldstone for some shitty icecream. That was SoOoOo not what I thought it was gunna be. Everyone (especially Mikey!) said that the icecream was the best...EVER! Well I beg to differ..I mean really ppl made this stuff sound like it was orgasmic. Nope, nope it definitly wasn't. Olivia informed me that Madi and I both just picked the two worst flavors in the place...so we'll have to go back and try one more time and then we'll see for sure haha! Nick was working today..aww hard little working boy..I just felt the need to say that.  I think people have a really big problem with keeping secrets. I really don't know that many people (actually there might only be one maybe two but that's pushing it) that I can actually tell something and not wonder how far it's gotten around after 10 minutes. Like one thing is I've seen it...even with some of my closest friends..They say one thing and do the OPPISITE..and i don't know why I don't expect them to turn around and do it to me. I guess that's funny that I'd call these people "close friends" when I have to ask questions like that, but I dunno..even when shit like that happens, for some reason I just keep coming back for more. W/e man haha..  Man..I can't believe schools been out less than a week..it sure as hell dosen't seem like it. It feels like we've been out for a month. Yeah I miss some stuff about school ..Like all the long assignments, hard bookwork, having to use my mind constructively, and listening to teachers and all their boring lectures..haha OR NOT...the only thing I really miss is the social part, like getting to see everyone everyday. Half the people that I considered "good friends" probally won't keep in touch. Ohh yeah I forgot one thing that I'm REALLY gunna miss about freshman year..ok get ready..JASON SABO! haha man I'll miss staring at him. (wow..can you say obsessed loser haha)But I mean really, DEEP down EVERYBODY thought Jason Sabo was hot, yeah even the GUYS haha! Anyway so back to the point..If this summer could be like school minus the books that'd be totally awesome, but since it can't I'll at least say this, This summer HAS to be Kick-Ass..it just has to be! There better be a least a couple good concerts, lots of BEACH time, hanging out with friends allll the time, and just living it up haha. Ok well I'm done for now...
