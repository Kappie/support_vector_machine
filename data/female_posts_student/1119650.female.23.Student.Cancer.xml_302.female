Last night I had a series of bizzare dreams based on various facets of the  urlLink Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker  game.  In one part I was swimming in the ocean and by doing different whistles I could control the direction that the waves would push me.  I was trying to get to shore, but I had to do all these random tasks before the native peoples (who turned out to be Japanese) would let me ashore.    The dream continued further when I acutally did come ashore I had to wander around Tokyo collecting various items.  There was a black boy around my age there who smelled really nice.  I found out it was becuase he kept cocobutter from the  urlLink The Body Shop  on hand and was constantly applying it so he didn't get ashy.  Then  urlLink Jeff  was there as well as Patrick and Arelis and we were looking for a place to go smoke the pot I found.  We went to some wierd kareoke bar/restaurant where all of my personal belongings were waiting in a suitcase.  The matire'd approached us asking if we liked Mrs. Robinson...Patrick said yes and they brought us a tv with this wierd kareoke song playing and the video was of some little old lady in a house coat scaling the side of a mountain.  WTF?  I woke up and went back to sleep.  I was in the  urlLink Food Emporium  thats by my job and I found my flute in the milk section, so I started playing various little songs on it.  One of them was a water song and all of thse water falls started falling from the ceiling and the lighting went all blue and all these hella cool fountains showed up.  I swam around some more, it was very refreshing.  Mary W. the auditor from my job was there and she was thanking me for allowing her to have reasonably priced hydrotherapy, so she gave me a small orb, I took the orb to this really elaborate fountain in the back and the water turned to strawberry milk....I floated around and drank it for a bit.  Then I woke up.  Alas heres a quick math lesson for you PaxilCr + Zelda + bedtime = seriously wacky assed dreams.
