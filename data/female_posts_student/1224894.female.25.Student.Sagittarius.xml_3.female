Now, after the break down of my computer...(what luck), again, a friend would advise me now to get an apple...Anyway, I don't know if this matters, but i might even have a hard time blogging...(as if, i blog that much). I really don't know what's happening anymore, i hardly sleep...i'm reading for the nth time, Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix...  The work on my house, has been stopped for a few days, and might not resume until next month...but i love it...at least, if my Mom tells me to go...i have a place to go to...   Hmmm...that sounds fun... still thinking about having a child though...and searching for Mr. Donor...hehehehehe That's an even lovelier idea...  Till next time...  Hey, JR...when are you blogging again.... and i saw your pics in the Apple Store...(BDW, nice legs!!!) hehehehe
