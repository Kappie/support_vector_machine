I get to see them on Tuesday though, but I still have to go to school! (Soooo unfair!) Hey Emma got the day off to get her dog!!! Ok, so err going into the mall or bristol yesterday sounded like fun... even though I don't get at all what happened! Hehe, and we have weird people viewing our website... wow their are weird people out their apart from us! (What's up with there and their? Aaargh it drives me crazy!) Oook... so I translated the French persons comments and it came out as this:  : The mede have ger semi stake have badly? Woohoo! Ahhh... FREAK OUT! So that was either a French person who said some thing in French and it comes out as crap in English who thought they would write it on a English web site... or a very confused Dutchman. Hmm... tough choice!
