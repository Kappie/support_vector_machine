SO much hasn't happened! :D  Wednesday: Music in the park! That was a blast and a half. After getting over my depression I realized I needed this day more than anything. And James called me. And we talked. He's such a sweetie and nutso. Really.  Then I went down to Laura's, where we walked into Brentwood to the park. It was a lot of fun, even if no one else wanted to dance with me. we met up with Cam, and Karissa and Nick and Steve were there, and we ran into Liz and Michelle, running some youth game. We went to the store and bought rat traps, and played with those..And yes, I still have the one that works...Yes :) Then I met up with James and we went for a drive. Then I was HOME. My morale, and life was masterly revitalised, after being so bummed lately.  Thursday: what? I decided that I had to tell Tom my feelings, cause I knew it would be impossible to do so at youth. I was right. And the email I got back was hardly satisfying, but....eh. I've given it up.  Friday: Cry it out, it's YOOOOOOOOOOOOOUTH NIIIIIGHT!!! YES! After checking my email and discovering that Laura wasn't going to go, I decided that I had to watch What Dreams May COme, which is on of my favortie movies, and the best to cry too. The whole movie, I was in tears. Man, it's so spectactualar, made me really jealous that people out there have a love like that. I know my time will come. I hope.  Then I got ready for youth, wearing my hot new shirt, and everything. I looked soo hot, not to brag, but yes. We got around and ate pizza, and attemped check in, to fail miserably. Then we went out to play some Unitarian Paintball...only because we used Q-tips, not paintballs. So fun, I think I still have purple on me :) Then we did check in, again, for real, and played Honey, I love you. I hate that game. Only because the slightest thing will make me laugh, because I am so happy:) Then we went outside and me and Fiona got involved in this impromto grass fight. I think I have all of the grass out now, not really sure. Then we got into Red Rover....Ooooh yeah. I got to hold Luke's hand, even if he was squezing it to death. It was still sexy dangerous. I forgot how hot he was. *RaWr!!!* Then Ian/Kula tried to take us out, and I ended up smashing my arm, but never letting go. And then I got to hold Ian's hand, even if it was for a minute. And it was soft...gentle..ahem. He also later said I looked hot in my outfit. At least someone noticed. (Ian is also super hot, he's like, drool...Oh man. I don't think I ever stopped liking him...HOTTIE). Then a few more guys tried taking out the link between me and Luke, it was like iron, nothing was going to. It was awesome.  Then we played Christians and Headhunters, and a few drama games that made us all laugh, and then we went inside. The guys were playing with their ring tones, which was so annoying, and watching Beauty and the Beast. Too bad I never brought my special edition...Oh yeah! Me and Lenaya were singing along to the parts we knew, and the lines where they were speaking. Then the guys...I think it was Max, Greg (my own brother), maybe Tom, and maybe Tony started throwing ice down my shirt. So I grabbed my sweater and got out of there, cause I didn't know why they were "flirting" with me like that. And I didn't really wanna know either. So I went and sat out on this jetty of rocks, then I decided I wanted to be closer to the road, and I FELL DOWN THE CLIFF. Rolled down about..10-15 feet, and it hurt, cause I landed on gravel. I limped back inside, where everyone was like, oh my god, what happened! And it was actaully bleeding too. It was ridculous, but I think it made those guys feel bad. They were apologizing after all.   Saturday/Today: Lake! We cleaned the carpets. I went to the lake with Karissa, Steve, and Laura. We went swimming for a bit, and then we played some asshole, and then...... When Fiona came back from Con Con she was raving about this card game, Egyption Rat Penis Fuck. And Karissa today told everyone she knew how to play. And now I know how to play the best game ever, and it's a Unitarian one. Oh yeah..It's so much fun. One game lasted almost like, an hour. It was wild. Then I came home, and re-organized my stereo thing, so I get maximum sound. I think I have it now.  The last few days have been really fun, and if I didn't post-overload on Tuesday, I would have blogged a while ago.
