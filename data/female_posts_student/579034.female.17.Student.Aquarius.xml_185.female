I'm home... heres the rundown of my "vacation"   Chicago:  this was fun.. when we got there we met up with Mick and his parents for dinner which was a lot of fun, always nice to see Curt and Gina, it was a good night even though Mickey wouldn't take me on the horsies. I went to see De Paul University and it was cool, i liked that it was in a city... chicago is awesome... I love it there.   Notre Dame Track Camp:  it was fun, i was always the last person to finish but.. hey.. its all good... the hall of fame was fun and seeing mick was awesome as always... my room mate was really great, Laura, shes from Fareport in Up-State New York and she runs the Manhattan Invitational too so when we have that meet i told her i'm probably gonna see her running past me cause she was really good... met a lot of nice people this year, it was cool cause we would all hang out together instead of little cliques.. it was nice. I went to this orientation for Notre Dame and I wanted to die the whole time, my dad looked like he was having a blast and a half but... I wanted to cry, it was torture, you have no idea.   Chicago Part 2:  very brief... only for one night, didn't do much.   The Hamptons:  It was great... Mick and I had a great time... we went to the beach, shopping, I got interviewed for a thing on CNN but they didn't use me... out to eat every night.. we saw Howard Stern, Kelly Rippa, and Candis Birdman.. we went boogie boarding, Mario and Mick became best friends.. it was great... being with Mick after we were havin all those problems was really good... it was great to be with him but it wasn't as hard as it used to be to say good bye... i missed him and still do miss him but i was okay when i got home i drowned my sorrows in a bag of pizza flovored Goldfish.  So now i'm home... i saw people yesterday, saw the girls at track and then hung out with deb and the boys... it was great i really missed all of them... today was pretty boring, i did nothing, had no one to do anything with... erica was away, deb was at the beach, melly was with greg... and im sure everyone else had things to do too... so yeah.. maybe tomrrow will be better. x0x
