If Oropeza wanted a paper, she should have just assigned one, and then graded us in her super non-specific, un-forgiving way. I like her as a lecturer, as a person, but the woman cannot write essay questions worth a damn. And the sad thing is that she thinks she's giving us a super juicy, interesting topic. I'm sorry, but if the entire class doesn't follow your line of thinking, maybe it isn't the class's fault. You know? I'm just saying.
