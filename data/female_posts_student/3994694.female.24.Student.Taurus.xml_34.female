She reckons that the martyrs of the second century after Christ are Martyrs of the Holy Spirit -- those persecuted for following the leading of the Holy Spirit. She was definitely one of those -- her method of praying inwardly (rather than outloud shock horror) had the Catholic Church in an uproar during her time. But she held to her relationship with God even though it went against the accepted cultural/religious boundaries of the time. Other examples would be Molinos, Hudson Taylor, Martin Luther, Fenelon and others. It just got me thinking about how some people  just  follow the Word and some people place the Spirit as higher. But really, the Word and the Spirit are one, and there should be no dissension. Sometimes we use the Word as a premise in our own man-made logical arguments -- but these arguments are not the Word themselves. Sometimes we try to step ahead of the Spirit -- second guess where He is leading and try to establish it ourselves without submitting to His timing. I really need to learn to be obedient to the Word and the Spirit. I think I can only do this through giving up  everything  of myself -- the things I believe are good as well as the things I believe are bad. For example, I might think that I am really good at worship leading and that a certain pattern of worship leading always works. But if this pattern of worship leading is not where the Spirit wants to go, then its worthless -- i.e. unless the Lord builds the house, those who labour labour in vain. That's a fairly weak example -- it could go much deeper. My ideas of marriage are good and biblical (from the Word), but that doesn't mean they will necessary happen -- I must give up my desires and submit to what God has given me (through the Spirit). There are countless other things that I hold as being spiritual or biblical but are actually still of myself -- I really want to give up all to God, not just the things I don't like about me.
