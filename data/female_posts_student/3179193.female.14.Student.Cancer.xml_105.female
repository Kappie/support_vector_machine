Called my mom to get permission. She said that Danny (aka Dan Benin), Herman, and Nima called. Herman left a message, I called Danny back but he wasn't home. I called Martin to tell him something and finally I returned Nima's call. Since I was at Moca's to hang out and stuff I didn't think it was a good idea to be talking on the phone with Nima so yeah. It was cool. Studying for History and blogging. Oh joy. Anyway... yeah. Having fun.  Today was a pretty emotional day. I cried myself to sleep last night after praying 'cos I was thanking the LORD for blessing me with great friends. Moca, Julie, and I cried at school so much. Haha... like Moca says "In the end, we're all fruit!" Funny Moca... gonna miss her. :(   *sighzZ* So much to say but I don't feel like blogging so yeah. Well, gonna go back to studying. I'm off. Peace to y'all. Love you guys.
