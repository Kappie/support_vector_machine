It's really weird, it's like the meaning of the lyrics changes depending on what kind of mood I am in.  Right now they seem kind of depressing, probably the reason being that I'm bored more than anything.  But then the song changes and it sort of ruins my point, but not really I guess.  Well, it's just something I've noticed.   Anyways, yes, so my family a.k.a. the wonderful group of people who just get along so mightily well *cough* decided to take a nice little "mini-vacation" to Connecticut.  Well, let me tell you, that long car ride with way too small of a space with some completely annoying person (my father, if you didn't figure it our yet) who is completely obsessed with hearing himself talk while other people were trying to relax made the car ride really pretty aggravating.  I definitely listened to so many CD's that my ears kind of started to hurt in that way that they do when you've been listening to your headphones for too long.  And I read for history, but I still have at least 50-60 pages to read but w/e I don't even care.  And not to mention those essays... Oh well Sunday will be fun, except not :-\.    So we went to visit Wesleyan College, which basically seems pretty boring, well it was sort of bland, because the winter does that to things, but they had a big hill that it looks like it would be fun to slide down after a snow storm.  I realized today as I was sitting in the car, that I definitely have S.A.D.D., seasonal activated depression disorder, or something like that (if someone wants to clear up exactly what it stands for that would be nice) because I noticed that the sky was really gray and I felt that if it was bright blue and summer/spring I would be really happy.  That sounds really weird, but it's true.  Also, I hate how dark it gets so early in the winter, I just feel like I have no time and nothing is as enjoyable.  It's actually kind of funny that I look forward to mud, because that's about the first sign of spring for me.    So, anyways, back off that tangent.  Then after we went to Wesleyan, we went and visited Yale.  The campus is beautiful.  It has a lot of really old architecture with a sort of medieval look to it.  I just really liked how it was set up and everything.  That's definitely the kind of campus I want to have when I go to college.  Some parts sort of look like Hogwarts, which of course is so cool.  You know it.  I decided that the top 3 things I want to have at whatever school I go to are:  1. Trees  2. Starbucks  3. The ability to study abroad  I totally want a beautiful campus and I definitely want to be one of those people who lounges around on the grass in the Springtime and I actually love the whole cafe atmosphere and you don't even know how psyched I am to study abroad.  I am looking forward to it so so much.  So, yes, those three things are what I want the most.  O tot he K, so back to my sort of nonexistent story.  After skipping some boring stuff in the middle, so we went to our hotel in New Haven and there was this whole ordeal with the indoor pool that they were supposed to have but didn't really, but it sort of long and boring and I don't feel like getting into it.  So for dinner we went to Chili's, where I'd actually never been and I got this Caribbean salad that was so so so so so so times a million good.  So that was exciting, and then um whatever the rest of our hotel stay was kind of normal and unexciting and I slept awfully like I always do at hotels.  So then this morning after we left the hotel we went to New London which is near Mystic down along the South Eastern Connecticut coast and we drove around for like an hour to try to find Connecticut College and then we finally did, but none of us were feeling all that well, so we kind of just drove around.  It was nice but not that appealing to me, kind of like a take it or leave it type of thing.  But I got a banner type poster so that was super exciting.  And then nothing else particularly interesting happened for the rest of the ride back.    My brother had been collecting change for about his whole life and he put it in those little rolls and exchanged it at the bank today.  He got $93.  That is c-r-a-z-y.  So I kept telling him over and over that he needs to get me a birthday present with that money and he wasn't very appretiative of that, but I do hope he gets me something super duper cool.    I am still trying to figure out what I'm going to want to do with my awesome fabulous coolio toolio friends for my birthday, but I'm really not sure yet.  My mom suggested pedicures and going out to eat, which could be fun.  I think I want to go out to eat again, but there aren't really that many good places too close to here.  So basically I have no idea what we're going to do, but I am still super excited about it anyways.  Only 1 month exactement until the John Mayer concert.  Seriously I am so incredibly excited for that.  (Right now I think Meliss will leave me another "John Mayer... eww" post, but I'll look forward to it anyways.)  But I am super excited.  I think I feel like giving myself a nice little pedicure/manicure maybe so I shall be off to do that I think.  I really want a light blue/aqua/turquoisey color but I don't actually have that color, so something else shall have to suffice.    It took me over an hour to write this (with a short break in the middle)
