Geetha and I went crazy in the girls toilet and we just couldn't quit rapping and dancing and singing in the toilet during recess. We changed all Singapore songs' lyrics and it turned into, "The toilet song". =\ It sounded REALLY fab anyhow!   Mdm Liujian forced me to join the Chinese New Year singing competition so Jason (hoongy) and I recruited a few people and now we've got some awesome ideas! We'll see how it goes during the practice sessions. We don't have much time left, the audition is drawing nearer.. it's on Friday! I'm really looking forward to this week. =) Not only is it Siti's, Val's, Miss Koh's and Junior PY's birthday, I want to get over all the tests. And Wednesday.. it's such an incredibly important day to me. It is the day, where by my fate would be in the hands of Mrs Abdul and finalised. My future. My dream. My hopes. There would be an NPCC meeting and I will know my position in the NCO hierachy. Man! Life is full of surprises!  Izzat and I went to the mall to get stuffs for school + Miss Koh's pressie after school today. And guess who we saw? Kym Ng and her Mamamia gang. She's so pretty that she got Izzat and I mesmorized.. By the way, the stunt she carried out yesterday was horrifying. Not many people can do that.  Toodles sweeties. Peace out. xox.
