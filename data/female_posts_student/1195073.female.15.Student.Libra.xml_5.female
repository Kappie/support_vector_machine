'just drop dead'  3. 'goodfellas'    4. going to lauren's for a mousetrap derby party (ok, that was yesterday)  things that made my day bad: 1. science tests (ok, yesterday) 2.language arts projects  random ramblings: ~damn, i want to be in a martin scorsese  film ~i want a chili cheese dog  quote of the day: "What am I? A schmuck on wheels?" -- 'Morrie' in Goodfellas
