Then, I went bowling with Brandon, Peter, and Stephen. Fun times. Except I sucked. Except for the last part of the second game. On the tenth frame I missed a turkey by one pin. Strike, Strike, 9. Grrrr. Oh well. It was still pretty cool to almost get a turkey. Then I went out to dinner with Carson. Fun times. We just sat in noodles and went over alll this stuff from junior high. All the files and stuff and we looked at the notebook and whatnot. I'm kind of glad we did it. I was sort of avoiding thinking about Junior High but now I'm kind of looking at it from a completely different angle.  And that was my lovely day. Good times, good times. I think I may go watch a movie or something now. Actually, I think I'm going to go read The Da Vinci Code. Although, it does sort of give albinos a bad name. Grrr to that. Hah, but any book that has albinos that I've ever read hasn't exactly shed a glorious light upon them.   I still feel really bad for telling him. I know it was the right thing to do, but I just feel awful I made a really good friend feel bad. Even if he's better, I know he's still upset about it at least somewhat and no one has any idea what I'm talking about so why am I even bothering??   Yeah, so...tonight. Heh. Interesting times. We stopped at the gas station to get gas and Carson was like, "get out of the car, you're helping me." So, I get out and then we like...couldn't figure out how to get the cap off. It was different than my car. Weird. So, we finally get it, and then the gas pump was evil and gave us a bunch of trouble. Goodness. I felt like one of those girls on that stupid MTV show, "Rich Girls." Haha, it was at least comically relieving. My hand almost froze off though. Ow. :(  And now....I read.  Heh. I just noticed how much I like this song but how few words it has. "I love the way you move..." YaY Outkast.
