Things have gotten better since two nights ago, but I was so selfish... I don't know.  I'm happier but nothing's going to change things with the exception of time. Things will get better... I promise. And I promise this to everyone who's in the same boat as I am.  Today is father's day. I just went on a coffee run for him. we're possibly going out on the sailboat today. It'll be a nice escape from reality, I'll probably listen to music and write. Even if we may never film it, I want to finish the script. I need to finish the script. I just have this really weird feeling the ending is going to be really really depressing. We'll see. I really don't want it to be, because it's already sort of a knock off of Rule of Attraction. I don't need to feed that impulse to my viewers... or readers... or whatever. I'll post it in my blog when I'm done. Everyone can read it. Like that asshole that left the unsigned comment. Seriously, if you can't leave a name don't even pretend like you have balls. Don't even act like it. Either leave a name or say it to my face... it's called respect, it's called HAVING A FUCKING HEART. :-) Thank you.  At any rate. I'm going to see what's up with my household. Too many people are randomly crashing at my place... it's starting to freak me out. Since when did my house become a homeless shelter? Ah, oh well. I was homeless a couple nights ago, so I don't have much room to talk. So off to the fabulous fathers day fun... riiight.
