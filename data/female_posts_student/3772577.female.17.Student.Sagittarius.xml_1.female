Usually I spend every minute with M, now he's gone off to Q-town to work, lucky him, and i have nothing to do but wander around, weed my garden, read, tan; all of which I love doing...in moderation and while I enjoy it. I sound spoiled I know. But when I am used to always doing stuff this empty void of endless blank days frustrates me. Lucky M, he has a job, I need one very badly. I have been looking since March, nothing. Yes I know I have been picky, but I don't want to stoop to the level of clog-your-arteries stink-like-grease-after-ten-showers would-you-like-fries-with-that quite yet. I plan to work this summer,  save  my money, work as far through the last school year as I can considering the amount of homework I will have, and graduate. I plan to have sent off my application to university in Ireland in the grade 12 school year,  get accepted , and leave for Ireland around August. In between Graduation and Leaving I say my goodbyes. That will be so hard. I want to go up with M to see Karin and Dale and the trapline before I leave. And the other goodbyes...M's goodbye will be the hardest. I haven't figured that one out yet. B droppped me off at the library today. She left and only then did I realize that the library opened in half an hour. I counted red and white cars until sharp ten when I figured they would open. I come in and the place is packed with people well established and settled in. When did they then open? I was grumpy from then on. The day contined like this. Very long. Finally we got home. A friend returning from Italy came and reminded me of how much I want to see Europe. I am tired of this North American blindness. I want free and sophisticated Europe very badly. Only one and a half months till Ireland. :) M phoned last night. I got all choked up. Hearing his voice was good, very good. His aunt already introduced him to some young pretty ladies his age...ggrrrr. "Uh Aunty, I have a girlfriend..." I don't think she heard. One was cute he said. Not to worry. He wouldn't do anything. His devotion stops him. I wish he were here...no I don't want to hinder him from experiencing this great opportunity of his. It's good for him to be away, to work, to see new people. I can survive. He comes home on Thursday though. I am looking forward to seeing him. I wonder what penalty his parents can concoct this time. We left his house on Sunday, went to mine, and said our 'goodbyes' in our own way. He stayed too long(read: 20 minutes); they heard when his truck left, his mom sped to stop him, yelled some power hungry fascist threats and drove away. I thought she would drive in here too, to condemn my soul, so I locked the door. She didn't though. He needs to get away from his parents most of all. I would change this for him if I could. Sometimes I wonder if that is the meaning of love; to want to do everything in your power to end the discomfort and misery and pain of someone else. Or is the meaning of love feeling the other person's pain in every part of your body when they hurt? Or the feeling that every cell in your body is the same and mirrored in their body and there is no such thing as two people but one glowing shimmering whole. I don't know...maybe the meaning of love is that it has many meanings, a meaning for everyone who has ever experienced it. Anyway there's my sappy end to this self-centered post. I hope tomorrow is better.       urlLink ">Link
