But I can't  because I have that issue once someone calls and wakes me up at 9:45am I can't go back to sleep...that and my back is killing me. Now I get to spend the day with the family, yay! :::gag me:::  At least I'm exempt from all my finals, except chemistry, which I don't have to take until 2pm on Thursday...   At night I pray  That soon your face  Will fade away
