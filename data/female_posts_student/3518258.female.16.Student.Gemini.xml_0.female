We haven't been together very long, but my feelings for you are startin to get strong. Im glad that we're together, even if it won't last forever. Im happy that we can clown around, when im with you I never frown. I hope for awhile we don't part, because when we do it'll break my heart!  ~ME!!!  Killa Bitch  Im not what you think i am in my mind im not all good everyone thinks they know me but im just misunderstood!  When they think of me they think im a snitch and they think of me as a lil dirty scared bitch!  But i could be one of those people who can snap ad go coo-coo i could be a person that would just come in and shoot you!  So the next time you call me a name tryin to put me to shame think about your death and weather or not i was to blame!  ~ME!!!  When I Think Of You another to david!
