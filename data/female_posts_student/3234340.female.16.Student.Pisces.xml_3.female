I just want to go to bed, but I promised Caryn I would come to her spring concert tonight.*sigh* I'm not sure Mom's going to let me go though. I think she's kinda worried about the weather, which is understandable. The weather is pretty bad and I don't like driving in the rain..so yeah.. I understand. I still really hope she lets me go though. I really wanna see mat tonight too. I like barely see him at school. I hate the end of the school year. Everything is so chaotic. With graduation and everything, i don't know how we ever get everything done. Not the mention, at the end of the year the food at school sucks, because they don't restock anyhtign after they run out of it... but anyways.. I love Mat so much. I can't believe we've been goin out for almost 10 months. That's a REALLY long time for me.. Other people don't think its that big of a deal, but I think its huge. I just really hope we stay together for a really really long time and stay all happy and stuff...
