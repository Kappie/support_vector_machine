Now I'm waiting for my right arm to quit being mega-huge, so I thought, "how bout a post".   Linds, is she going back tomorrow? Looking at the calendar just a while ago the thought had occured to me that it's about time.  Hmm. My guts are ablaze, the meds have stopped working altogether. Grr. I hate me. I wish I could speak guts, because they're saying something really interesting right now.  This weekend was cool. I made spaghetti last night that turned out really well...we made a bit much tho, so da will be having fun with wheat and cow for the next three days or so, I'd gather.  Bleh, I feel really wasted. I think I'll blame Kelly.  I'm not sure about the shelter. You know about girls and guys with puppies...I get hit on a lot, it's not very comfortable. Eh, but I like the place so. I don't know. Maybe I can stand it since it's only on Saturdays, with the puppies and stuff. Why don't these girls understand that when I use the "girlfriend" word in context with the simple sentence and article, "I have a", it means it's time, rather than giving me your phone number, to walk away? Sigh. I don't know, this is a not cool feeling, and I thought I would be EMO and rant it here. Grr, I was just doing my job. Grrr. I hate people sometimes. Alright, now I'm cool.  Time to go get some markers! Peace.
