I need an umbrella for tomorrow. Founder's Day. Ugghh. The only one of remotely enjoyed was the one during which it rained. Most of the time we sit outside in the blazing sun, being burnt to a crisp, while watching people give speeches for two hours. At least the food is decent.  My mother stopped coming because it was so boring, so Kelly is replacing her.  My room is a complete mess. I have no time to clean it either. So much. Today I copied Fiona's planner (she's a hell of a lot more organized than me) and I found that I have at least two humongo projects everyweek until the end of the quarter. Which is the end of Freshman year. I hate being a freshman.
