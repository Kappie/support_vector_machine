I should have been here at 8 am, but just before 6 there was an explosion and a fire underground in a manhole which knocked out the power to over half of my town.  I plan on doing nothing in the four hours that I am here.  Its very weird to be with out power.  We had no phone, no hot water, no tv, no computer, no internet, no videogames, no radio, nothing.  We were entirely shut off from the world.  It was so crazy.   Power is back on and I'm here at work again, but no one is here.  We might get a REALLY cute puppy though.  I'll keep y'all posted about that.  Eeeeeee!
