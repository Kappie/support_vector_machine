The only person I hang out with is Tregory, or Spuddy or Mary if they come over. It's kind of sad, like 8th grade summer was off the hizzy forshizzy, I guess because I was such good friends with Krista and she lived like 5 minutes away. And I went to Oneighty alot so I could see my buddies. And now I move to this redneck hick of a town and I get excited when I go to Wal*Mart. *sigh...* Nobody gets online anymore, I guess it's because they actually have LIVES TO LIVE!!! I have like this insignificant little speck of what you call a life. I wish I had church to go to...I can't wait till I get to drive by myself to church. That'll be cool. I have a boring life. A crazy one but boring. The fact that my mom and grandmother have Alzheimer's disease doesn't really help. Adds lots of drama, but doesn't help. I'm trying to work on an Alzheimer's Disease website for mostly teens but I just haven't felt up to it. Maybe I'll work on it later tonight. My grandmother is getting worse, but at least she is old enough for the regular stereotypical alzheimer's patient, unlike momma. I really wish she didn't have it...Just irks me to see her, because I know she isn't the same. Enough about that...I think I will work on that site. Later Peeps. 3 Cherry
