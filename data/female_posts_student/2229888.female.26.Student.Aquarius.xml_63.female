"i miss you and the baby. let me tell him i love him. i'll be home tomorrow (thursday, next saturday) for sure."   then tomorrow comes without him and without a phone call for another week.   i'm living with friends. he hasn't sent money. he's supposed to be on a temporary job, but it's beginning to feel permanent.   i think i may have to make other plans. the only place i can go is with my brother in Cally and thats forever away from "the valley".   i want to go to school. i want to work. i want to be with my baby. i want. i want. i want.   and then lemondrops and gumdrops were raindrops...
