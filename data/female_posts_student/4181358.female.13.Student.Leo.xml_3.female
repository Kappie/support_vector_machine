Last year was soo much fun! we were riding up an down the elevator, drinking Red Bull and even spying on the counselors having stemy makeouts with boys! HAHA      Im so excited cause my cousin's going with me. I rarely ever see her cause she lives in Missouri! Im really bored right now though. Im all packed :) Something that rarely ever happens.      CAMP at PHANTOM was a blast! Teddy and I were friends and Swimming Buddy Partners. Now thats a match made in Heaven. Everybody kept laughing at Maddie. She's so perverted. She changes in front of us  ON PURPOSE!  What kind of pervert does that. Everybody was talking about not wearing a bra and how its so disgusting thatyou can see other people  through  and Maddie comes down from her bunk and is like I CANT BELIEVE I FORGOT TO PUT MY BRA ON! Ew. and as always she changed in front of us. Anyways. Maddie came up to us and is like "keep in touch" everybody.... you know what that means right? Everyone was so grossed out! All my GIRLS I LOVE YA! AND REMEMBER BECCA STINKS!      ~Rachel      Mood: Hyper (really hyper)      Song: Hey Ya!  Outkast
