I am stupid that way..its 3:00 the hotest part of the day...on the hottest day of the year and I am outside working away! :)  It was alright though.  I got to drive the lawn mower! We have this thing where we hook up a trailer to our mower..it was coool. So I got my dad to put the trailer on the mower and I loaded about a hundred bricks into the trailer. Then I drove the mower to my garden and unloaded them.  But there was one problem..the place where the bricks were stacked was like a bug hotel. It was disgusting. Bugs where flying everywhere.  I even found a bee nest in one brick!  yuck.  I hate bugs!  After I was done stacking the bricks I dug more of the pathway where I am going to lay the bricks. Now I am already to lay my pathway!! On sunday my mom is taking me to lawn and garden land to buy all my plants!!! *woot*  I am quite excited.  :)
