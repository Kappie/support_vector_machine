I keep telling myself that I'm fat and ugly and need to lose weight. this sucks. i skipped my uncle's wedding (not that i really knew him anyway) but yes i feel bad. I dont even know if he's my uncle. He might be my cousin. I have no clue.   I planned to do so much in the summer when I was still in school, but am I doing any of it? Noo... nothing. I haven't even gone for a skate yet. That's bad. OH yah, does anyone want to sponsor my stupid attempt of being a photographer, meaning buy me a camera. maybe i should go rob a bank. just like Dr Ock in Spiderman. okay no. thats just stupid. I'm going to have to rent The Recruit, The sum of all fears and possibly Coyote Ugly. yup, im going through a Bridget Moynahan phase. its funny. Im incredibly weird. She's a pretty good actress though I must say. and she did play soccer. and ya know, anyone who plays or played soccer is a friend to me. I'm even thinking of buying a signed picutre of her and Will Smith on ebay. speaking of Will Smith,  HE IS FINE . did  ANYONE  see that body in the movie. oh my. it is  hotttt .   okay sorry. hmmmmmmmmm.. i think im hungry but im not sure. hilary where the hell are you?? you havent updated in like 4 days and im not seeing you online either. okay well i might go eat now (yes, get even fatter) hooo boy.
