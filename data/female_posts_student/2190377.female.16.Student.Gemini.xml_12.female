Otherwise... next time there will be a giant mousetrap waiting for her.    There are no raccoons.  Go to hell.    im soooo tired  ran 30 sprints, killer eights, 2 suicides, and 10 laps around the gym  *collapses*  because nothing has happened yet today, i shall instead copy and paste and be boooring wow i chose REALLY weird word order for that sentence  spaceypiXiechick: im such a seventh grade boy spaceypiXiechick: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh GoCombatChuckGo: ???
