Thank you for letting us worship and live our lives for you freely,  without major persecution.          I pray for our brothers and sisters overseas who  are facing suffering because they are your children, Lord. Help them in times of  trouble, encourage and strengthen them. As Ramadan approaches, I pray that those  believers who will go through even more persecution are surrounded by your love,  and they stand firm in their faith.           Father I pray for Daniel, who's not feeling well,  and anybody else who is sick. May you place your healing hand upon us, and help  us to recover quickly, so that we use our gift of health to serve you  fully.          For those of us at school, I pray that we still  make time for you. I pray that we see you as our Father in Heaven who will  always be there for us, when we're upset, stressed, tired and just sick of it  all. And you'll never get sick of listening to us. How amazing you are, God!!! :  )          in Jesus' name,  Amen
