Dave, in my opinion, is a TOTAL ASS for even starting to be like that. Jason? Ryan? you listening? If you just sparatically decide you ever "need your space" when the girl you're dating is perfectly normal, don't be an ass about it, or all of us with y chromosomes are going to come give a a swift kick in the behind and throw you in a tank of pirahna infested waters. with Dave. or what's left of him anyway....  Laura, that major sucks about tu madre... i know she was totally into that job and such too... a sincere wurd to you mamma... yeah, i do agree thought hat at least they were decent to her. none of this sparatic change of emotions like such (AHEM) assholes (ahem DAVE).  I didn't have too terrible of a day, but it was rather adventurous. i had to go to cupertino to get this random cd for drama, but a way different way than i usually go, and got lost. i finally get there, only to realize that they're remodling the damn thing, so they moved it temporarily... and the madness doesn't stop there. i find my way to the new place, get my cd, and walk out to find that i have locked my keys in the car. Luckily, i have my cell, so i start calling everyone i know (my mom's super sick and high on allergy meds, so driving isn't too good to her, and my dad's in LA). But alot of people are at practice for whatnot and i just can't get a hold of anyone. I look inside my car and see my frappachino, melting away without me. AAA says 3 hours. 2 minimum. It starts to rain. I look at my sweat shirt through the window and think how nice it would be to wear it. My cell battery is dying because of me calling everyone, and the library's closed. finally (yes, there is a good point to this story) my mom randomly pulls up. I was both mad at er for getting out of bed, cause she looked like she was dying, and over exuberant about me actually having some warmth. so yeah. that was my unexcitment of the day.. oy oy...   just another manic monday.....
