Nothing really exciting about that, but one more year of high school to go through and I'm done (aww Erica 'member when I was just a silly freshman...) I don't like being the oldest though...I donno, just not my thing, and being in theatre without anyone from a higher class than me is weird to think about. But oh well ya know? Summer time :D no school...school sucks...but I dont have to think about it. And I'm pretty sure I got all A's and one B...go Sarah...you can handle it.
