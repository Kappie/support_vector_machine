I guess you CAN tell between the two althought it is hard...i guess if ukno if GOD is talking to you .... u kno its not ur own voice cuz its totally something you wont' expect to hear....something that can scare you..or maybe even clear up the obvious for u..the obvious as in something u are contemplating that u kno that shoudl be but u just dont'wanna except..so u sort of deny it and stuff like that and BAM! God tells u wat to do and it freaks the living shit out of u but u kno wats going on...well i don't think u get scared....but moments liek those sort of confuse u the over all existence of GOD and what not...like u sort of beleive in HIS existence but at the same time you are shocked and u question urself and say  holy shit did that really just happen or is my mind playing tricks on me again?   then again if u didn't hear HIM speaking to u...would u even beleive in teh existence of GOD at all?..I know I wouldn't..well like I beleived that GOD was real and existed just the fact taht I didn't think that HE would want to exist in my world cuz i was such a screw up and rebelled against my conscience...dammit for even a while..i considered myself the  FATE REBEL  and i guess that was why i was so down..cuz i questioned everything that happened to me instead of just beleiving that everything happens for a reason....man like I hated the fact that something liek being CATHOLIC would like just make me lead a blind, dull and planned out life..i thought that there was no point in following GOD cuz HE knew everything that was going to happen so why in the world would i wanna live like that? if i knew someone knew my whole destiny why in the world did i want fulfill it out...well damn i was freaking wrong....thats when i heard of something called  FREE WILL . Like I heard about it all the time..it was 24/7 in my face all the time sort of ting but i never really bothered with it..i was and still am naive..like free will is basically something like GOD gave us the power to make our own choices and to either   a) follow HIM  or  b) follow what WE and the WORLD want  So with all that cleared up I understood more...and thats why i came to the conlusion why the world is SSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOO screwed up... everyone says they don't beleive in GOD cuz there is so much pain and suffering and if their was a GOD why would he let it all happen..u kno why these things happen and everyone is' suffering'? cuz these SOBs don't turn to GOD...they use the b)part of the God's free will and so they do whatever they want..and still even if U R suffering u can turn to GOD for help...suffering is not neccesarily bad... it can teach u so much things and ultimately draw u closer to GOD....like i think everyone should try to turn to GOD...like the barber story   Barber to customer: I don't beleive that God exist Customer: Why? Barber: Do you see that homeless man out there? (points to homeless man with long dirty untrimed hair) If God existed then there wouldn't be problems liek homelessness.. Customer: Well then in that case, I don't beleive that barbers exist neither Barber: (laughing) But I am a barber and I am cuttin your hair Customer: So if barbers existed, why would poeple like that homeless man that walked by still dirty unclean and uncut hair Barber: Because the homeless man doesn't want to go the barber's i guess? Customer: Exactly!..Its liek God...people have all these sufferings and pains but the problem is...they don't turn to him for help     NUFF SAID..GOD does exist..problem is..would u turn to HIM? [confused.but.still.a.beleiver]
