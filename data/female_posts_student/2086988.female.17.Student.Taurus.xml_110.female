Get to sleep in...Watch all the tv I want and have some real ME time...I like being by myself, every once in awhile you need to just be alone. Especially when someone (cough cough) Kiera is always breathing down your back about if you eaten lunch, or dinner or breakfast. If you really wanna piss me off, then that's the question to ask. Like last Friday, I had to be at her church by 8pm to leave for the lock-in. Well, my parents came home as usual late and I didn't have anything to fix for dinnner, so I grabbed a protein bar and left. Well, she offered me some fries, ok everyone knows that I always try to eat low carb. And just because I didn't want that she's all like, "Ashley you anger me." Seriously, what does it matter if I eat or not and then she argued with Katrina at the Lock-in for like an hour because Katrina didn't want to eat. I understand that, sometimes it's best to leave people alone. Then on Saturday, she asked me if I'd eaten all day, does it matter, that just makes me so mad. I know I've done somethings in the past, but after a year or so you'd think she'd leave me alone, it's not like I'm freaking anorexic, I mean I wish, lol jk. But she always does that, so thank god it's almost summer and I can have some peace, at least Ritika understands and knows that everything is ok, I just wish some people would shut up and stop breathing down my back about things, it's not a big effing deal!
