Actually, it makes me think of Emily in a...nostalgic for the summer before freshman year kind of way. which is creepy for one because...why does that cover remind me of emily? and 2) stop thinking about Emily! so anyway...why does it remind me of emily? i think cause she has/had (havent seen her wear it yet this spring) a shirt like the one girl does on the cover and the other girl sort of kind of looks like emily a little... or...like she used to look... like she could look if she was 13 again? sort of? the hair's close... and... the nose a little... and... gosh, i dunno. and theres this "soft" thing going on...and...remember the "angelic moments" talk on livejournal? yeah...  wow, im crazy.
