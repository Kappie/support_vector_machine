The bitches that think they are the only one there and take up the whole damn stripe of pavement. I'm talking about the people that jack knife their crappy ass bikes in the middle of the path, then act like you are some kind of burden when you try and get around them. The topper is when they let out a big sigh when you ask them to move over a bit, then they stare at you until you are out of their sight. This just proves my theory that humans are the worst thing to happen to this planet, of course, not including me.
