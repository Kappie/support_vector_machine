We drove from CT to NJ, normally it only gonna take 1 hour more something, but there was HUGE traffic. It took us almost 2 hour to get there, but the driving was not too bad, three of us chat together while in traffic. The Japanese market is much bigger than I thought and it was nice that there is bookstores and little stuff stores around it. We went to eat first 'cause we were so hungry. The food was ok, and I had have better before. After that, we went to bookstore first. I didn't buy anything from the bookstore, but Sugi and Toshi bought some thing. Then we went to those little stores. All those stuff are cute, but I think I passed the age to buy those cute stuff. I mean I still like them a lot, but don't wanna buy them anymore. I wanna a Japanese futo, but futo over there are too expensive!! 300 dollars something!!! I can't afford it. I am too poor. Anyway, after all those things, we went to buy food. It was fun to look at all those Japanese products. Oh, we took those small pics. I remember that Tadayoshi told me there is the machine. I think we had fun. After that, we went to Flushing to eat hot pot. Flushing is just same as always. Hot pot was good, and we ate a lot!!! This summer is Fun at all.  敏，山和我昨天一起去了新泽喜和纽约。我们先去的新泽西，去那家日本超市买食品。在Yahoo上看到只要一个半小时就到了的地方，因为堵车居然用了两个多小时，还好是三个人一起去，在车里大家可以聊天。那家日本超市比我想象中的大，但可能是因为不是周末的原因，没有太多的人在。我们先去吃东西，我吃的是拉面，还好啦。我吃过更好吃的。然后哦，山就说要去书店看看，我们就先去的书店。因为上个星期才去过日本书店，所以我没有买什么东西，倒是山和敏买了一些书。书店的旁边有些卖小东西的店，就是那种很可爱的小东西。但是因为我已经失去了对可爱小东西的购物欲望，所以什么都没有买。回到超市后，就开始买食物，然后就去照小照片！！那里有小照片的机器哦！！挺好玩的。在归家的路上，我们决定去法拉盛，去那家四川菜吃火锅！！不错，不错。很好的一天，吃的好饱，这个夏天到头来一天也不坏哦！！ urlLink     urlLink
