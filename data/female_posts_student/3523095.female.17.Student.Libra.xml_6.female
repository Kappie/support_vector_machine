I don’t know my purpose in being there. I didn’t do much there also. I didn’t go for vina class today. Feel bad about it. Guess she would have taught the last part of the keerti… it’s a very beautiful song. The tune constantly runs in my head. But only part of it….i guess I have some catching up to do…the last part is like the last piece of the jigsaw. Haven’t fit it in yet. The tune I hum is unfinished.   PW is in an okok shape right now. I have burdened my wonderful secretary. Am such a lousy leader. Oh well….i got no choice.   Am tired. Got no energy to rant. Will finish here. Guess it’s a break for you…read a short post for today…   bubbye
