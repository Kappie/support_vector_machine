Sure, the was a little shock when Monash beat us in the very first match of the tournament, but he neglected to mention our complete disorganisation pretty much caused the loss.  I suppose it was better in the fact that it  was  the shock that some of the more arrogant members of our team needed to realise that we are not in fact invincible :)  The  urlLink report for day two  was slightly more on the mark.  There is no doubt in my mind that our semi against Adelaide was the match of the tournament and way tougher than the final against Monash on day three.  I was very proud of the way Moho pulled together after our dissapointing loss.  We were a very tight unit by then end and I really really hope that we get enough people interested in going to perth.
