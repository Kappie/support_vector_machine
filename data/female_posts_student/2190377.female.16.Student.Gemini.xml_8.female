It's okay, though, because basketball starts MONDAY.  The end of my freedom. Forever........  blar  The bus rides have been fun while they lasted :D Today we played telephone.  It was made all the more interesting by the fact that Matt is almost deaf in one ear, as proven by those tests that make you take in driver's ed.  hehe. SOOOO! Chris Peterson starts "Ashleigh likes pink elephant nuts",  later turns into "Ashleigh licks pink elephant nuts" and by the time it gets to me it's turned into "Ashleigh charges nine cents a blow."  Obviously I was GREATLY offended by Chris :) So I changed it to his name, thinking that he was a dirty perv who started a naughty line.  He practically died when he heard the end result.    Ashleigh likes pink elephant nuts = Chris charges nine cents a blow  oh boy!!!  Time to start math project.  bye now
