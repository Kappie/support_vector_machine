We did take a scenic boat ride.  That was a lot fun.  We learned a lot about the history of the lake and that region, which is really cool for me cause I love hearing about that stuff.  My dad said we can look into renting a lake house for next summer instead of going to the beach.  When we get back from the beach he may take me white water rafting.  I can't wait!!! The boat tour was really cool though because of our tour guide he's really funny.  One day I'm gonna own one of those houses.  Some interesting facts about the place: The lake scene of Dirty Dancing was filmed there, the lake scene from 28 days was filmed there, there were also some other movies but I don't remember them(go figure.)
