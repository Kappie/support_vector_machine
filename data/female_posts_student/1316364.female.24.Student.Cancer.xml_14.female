The last phone conversation I had with him was last monday. He didn't even call on New Years which really upset me. I really want to be strong about the whole situation at hand but It is very hard if the person I am trying to support cannot even call me to even just say hello. Last time we talked I asked him to call as often as he could, even if it meant he had to call collect or buy a phone card. I do hope for his sake that whatever has been keeping him from calling me is important. So Jesse I say to you "if your ears are ringing, it's because I am thinking thoughts about you, so call me. Every day I have no call it makes me feel like you don't care what happenes to me. So please please please call home. I miss you and need to know you are ok."
