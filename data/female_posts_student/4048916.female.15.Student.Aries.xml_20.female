Things that say, "Send this to 45667 people and the guy you like will propose within the next 2 hours!!!" ... but sometimes, on the odd occasion, there's one one that you actually find funny, and that's what happened to me today.  I opened my emails this afternoon, and discovered about 5 forwards of the same thing ... thinking it must be good, I opened one of them, and this is what I found:   Application to Date My Daughter   1.

Signature ________________________      Thank-you for you interest. Please allow four to six years for processing. You will be contacted in writing if you are approved. Please do not try to call or write (since you probably can't, and it would cause you injury). If your application is rejected, you will be notified by two gentlemen wearing white ties carrying violin cases (you might watch your back).   Anyway, I found it amusing when I first read it. Enjoy!
