Besides wanting to seperate from my family like Church from State, I have just been miserable and moody and there is a full moon again.  I want to thank everyone for bearing with me, especially Tom and Paul... of course Michelle and Rob were kinda patient .. j/k.. but these 2 gentleman would not leave my side and made me laugh and stuff mostly when I wanted to wallow etc. Next time I see you, you get the biggest hug ever... and a present! I also have a new found OBSESSION with The Smiths!! Oh man oh man, I just wish I wouldn't have waited so long.. MMMMMMMMmmmmmmm Smiths.... Morrissey...  what am I doing here????   Well, my depressive moods have caused me much an unsettled mind and luckily I did write some of my feelings down.  "I don't need, nor will I ever need anyone in my life. The basis for this is abundantly clear that no one thinks about me in the proper form. Most everyone (avoid generality with respect to logic, not excluding anyone) has an agenda and uses me and anyone else in accordance with it. I regret to inform myself that genuine emotion from anyone not tied into how I can facilitate something for them, is absurd.  I have held in my emotions to points where they have been breakdowns and even I myself could not make heads or tails of things. I feel like I am in an abyss over taken by some force that will never clear my soul. No one would ever understand this pain because to them remote minute things seem to set me off, but that is not the story. These small farthings are pebbles falling after and before an avalanche and remind me of past and future pain, creating  present.  Its more than just general sadness, its far more. Its the realization that feelings do not matter to anyone. I take others feelings and preserve them while others see this as a   weakness."  And please no one take this as I am attacking any one person, because it was the rawest of emotions and an outpour. Next time I will relay the stories I am and have been working on fervently.
