Not only is this crap ugly, but it takes up the parking space of a mini van, and then some of the active road. Not only that, but it gets like negative four mile per gallon.  Those really annoying scooters. The people who use these machines are lazier than hipoes. I can walk faster than most of them.  They have wheels! Yet they want a petrol guzzling machine that will take them 10 miles per day. Why not get a mo-ped, even they are better! These scooters might have been less annoying if they were quieter, but nope, not even that.  Last but not least, the new Mc.Ds. It uses more electricity than a entire subway line.  Tsk, Tsk, Tsk, and I had to witness them all on friday, poor poor me. 8(
