It's there to soothe you and get you through a particularly tough time, one that is not so readily solvable, or to tide you over between tough times.  It is comfort and joy incarnate, and as it winds its way from the carton to the spoon and through your body, it spreads that joy to you, so that it can very nearly emanate from you.  Of course, it also has the effect of adding on the pounds, but this is rather a small price to pay.  It's also God's way of getting you to exercise - if you are going to enjoy one of His finest creations with as little repercussions as possible, then you'd better get your butts up off the sofa and into the gym.  Of course, it is not so easy to practice what one preaches.  It seems I want all the comfort of ice cream without any of the sacrifice.  So I am doomed to a life where I never fit into my clothes...But still I think the ice cream is worth it.
