When it became clear just two weeks ago that only one of the teachers   in Constantinople would be looping with his students, the logical,   albeit painful, choice seemed to be to close that house.    they're closing constantinople... i'd really it reather have been kyoto... because its just.... there. constantinople's got good kids, merkesh's (spelling?) got all the smart kids, and florence has the most spirit. kyoto's got all the kids who don't care... SO SHUT THEM DOWN!   what the crap. (i've taken to saying that a lot since the cousins have been here... better then saying the BAD 'F' word... but i'm afraid it'll stick... =/ WHAT THE CRAP!!!)  thirdly... victoria's having a b-day party! yay... except, i'm afraid TINO is going to be there, then she's going to complain how we haven't comunitcated at all and shyt... or maybe she's already moved *hopes to god*   um.... besides that... lifes been pretty boring. as always.  i'm afraid i'm becoming lazy and eating a lot *cries*   its a very scary time in my life....   ok, have a nice life! =D  •patty•
