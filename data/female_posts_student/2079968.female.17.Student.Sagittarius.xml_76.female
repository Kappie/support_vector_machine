I still haven't written my 1-2 minute speech for the  urlLink Leukemia-Lymphoma Society  yet...I should do that. we're gonna start raising money for the society...it's a really awesome cause. i'll try to explain the whole thing later...but for now click the link above for more info, and if you're interested in donating spare change, i'll let you guys know when this kicks off...  Cancer is a scary thing...it can affect anyone...i think it's important to do all we can to help those in need and find improvements in medicine...also, prayer helps.  it sounds a little PSA, but i guess this is what it is. this is a serious issue, for once.
