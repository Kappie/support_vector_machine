SOOOOOOOOOO  much! i would list everything must most of is personal and not meant to be said. wow..i just cant believe that im in grade 9 now, practically. its crazy but awesome! i went and hugged everyone..and it was almost sad to think i may never hug them again and have a conversation with them again. i'm really going to miss people next year, and the funny thing is i'll probably miss the people that im not close to the most...because the people im close to i'll probably be close to next year too. well..this is dedicated to my grade 8 year.. it was awesome.. to all the people who i wont get to see next year, I LOVE YOU!!!!
