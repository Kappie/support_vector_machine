Aren't any of us ever going to learn how to really get over ourselves and love each other? He talks about his definition of mature love and at the same time it seems completely right on, rational, clear and compassionate, it also just hits me how far it seems we all are from it.   "Mature love is union under the condition of preserving one's integrity... a power which breaks through the walls which separate man from his fellow men, which unites him with others; love makes him overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits him to be himself, to retain his integrity. In love the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two...  Only if I know a human being objectively, can I know him in his ultimate essence, in the act of love "...   okay, in rereading this pat definition, it sounds sort of melodramatic... but in the book he does well to define each of the words in the definition as a realistic truth, not phantasy (I like his 'ph' spelling of this word) or some idealized concept. You get the earthy reality of it.  Have I ever really even seen mature love as he describes it? Let alone experience it. Good lord, we've all got a lot of explaining to do to each other. Makes me want to treasure that magic word 'love' and be really careful with it. Also makes me want to second guess and criticize everyone I hear throwing it around all the time, myself included.  We like the word, but we don't back it up with the work that makes it meaningful .  After tearing down all of our false conceptions about love and defining its many forms, the final section of the book is called 'The Practice of Love', and it's where he really gets into what we're doing wrong, and what kinds of practices are necessary to begin to get better at this whole Loving thing. Some necessary traits to begin the practice:  ~~ Discipline - "I shall never be good at anything if I do not do it in a disciplined way; anything I do only 'if I am in the mood' may be a nice or amusing hobby, but I shall never become a master in that art."  ~~ Concentration - "To be able to concentrate means to be able to be alone with oneself- and this ability is precisely a condition for the ability to love. If I am attached to another person because I cannot stand on my own feet, he or she may be a lifesaver, but the relationship is not one of love. Paradoxically, the ability to be alone is the condition for the ability to love... To be concentrated in relation to others means primarily to be able to listen. Most people listen to others, or even give advice, without really listening. They do not take the other person's talk seriously..."  ~~ Supreme Concern - that is to say, in order to learn this art it must be of supreme importance  to you  that you learn it. "If the art is not something of supreme importance, the apprentice will never learn it. He will remain, at best, a good dilettante." How high up on the priority list is learning how to love for you REALLY? This is a difficult question to answer honestly, at least for me. It speaks of how much time and energy one is  actually  willing to invest in patiently learning one's relationships.   ~~ Overcome One's Own Narcissism - esp by learning to be objectively reasonable as well as humble. "I must strive for objectivity in every situation, and become sensitive to the situations where I am not objective. I must try to see the difference between my picture of a person and his behavior, as it is narcissistically distorted, and the person's reality as it exists regardless of my interestes, needs and fears." Here he also brings up the point of how important it is to use these skills in ALL of life, not just within the confines of an intimate relationship. He says for example "If someone would want to reserve his objectivity for the loved person, and think he can dispense with it in his relationship to the rest of the world, he will soon discover that he fails both here and there."  >0 Ahh and there is more still, I have not finished reading yet... I'll see if I can gut through the rest of it... I might have to refill my Paxil prescription first... lol. But it's a HOPEFUL book, and exciting to imagine achieving the high standard he sets... I think we have too much leeway with the word 'love', and in general accept far less than we ought to in the name of it. We also accept blindly that whoever is using it means it in the way we mean it when we say it. Does that make sense? lol... We assume everyone else defines love as we do. When in actuality, it's really hazy. Ask your lover today: what do you REALLY mean when you say 'I love you'?   Notice how we use the word love. Love is an action, not a feeling. We don't usually say 'I feel love for you', we say 'I love you'. We might say 'I feel loving today', which implies feeling expressive, active. Love is something we  do , something we enact upon the world, not something that happens to us passively that we are powerless in the face of. Remembering that it is a verb makes it seem more empowering, like there's more of a choice involved.   I think we get really caught up in this dramatic idea that we can't control our love, that somehow we don't have a choice in the matter. Sometimes it can feel that way, when things are difficult in a relationship but something is telling you to stick around and work it out. But that IS a choice- the hard choice, and a noble one if the relationship is really healthy and has some potential (and you aren't just sticking around because you are neurotically afraid of being alone). But it is a choice, and to me that makes it even more exciting, more passionate- that we would choose to stick something out when it gets hard, and put the long term priority of learning how to love before the short term discomfort of a small argument.
