Let's just say its not my cup of tea.  I can't wait to be free.  *sigh*.  I'm not really sure when I'm going to hand in the blue uniform but I'm hoping to quite before the end of the year.  If I quit, I won't go to camp and I'll actually be able to enjoy the summer time.  Finally, after many years, I'll be free on tuesday nights.  I can't wait.  There's just so much I can take.  I've had enough of cadets and I don't want to be in it any longer.  G'day to all.                                                -Julie
