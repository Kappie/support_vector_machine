Alas, I can't lament it. I'm making the most of it. I'm meeting new people. I'm learning. I'm living. I'm having a blast. Why is JSA an amazing experience after only one week?  1. Classes. I know, what? Classes, but yes classes. Oh my gosh. They are so interesting it's not even funny. It's an open debate and discussion forum where people from all over the country and out of the country just discuss foreign policy, controversial issues, and the rhetoric of politics. We make speeches, speeking of which my first one is on Monday. We discuss policy decisions. We debate. It's just great, nnd it's 3 hours!  2. Connected to classes...the teachers. The teachers here are amazing. At first I really wanted Dunkar because she's this out-of-this-world, Jamaican woman who just is so energetic and passionate. She urges us to turn the world upside down and the first assignment for her class was to read Colon Powell's report on the 2004 agenda and "come up with a better idea." Haha. She's so cool, and even though I don't have her, she's still like amazing. My real foreign policy teacher is Dr. Anand. She's amazing. She speaks like every language on this planet, it's crazy. She is also like THE nicest, most interesting person I think I've ever met. She already offered to put me up for a couple nights in her house in the South of France when I go later this summer because she's just that awesome. We click really well. Her class is just an open space for discussion and even though we already had our first test this Saturday, I feel like I'm getting so much out of the class. My Political Commmunication teacher, Dr. Worth, is different. He's not openly nice. You have to like earn his respect, which is admirable. He's brilliant, as is just about ever professor here. I have so much respect for them it's insane. He really makes us think about how rhetoric and politics are so realted and how rhetoric and "ethos" have taken over the system. Yeah, but everyone here loves this stuff, as do I. Oh for my Congressional Workshop class/ Debate class, I get to debate affirmative action on Wednesday.   3. The people. They people here are from all over the country and they are amazingly cool. My roommate's from Egypt. This guy we call Chief is from some commonwealth no one's ever heard of and took a 17-hour flight to get here. All the accents are so cool and I think I'm starting to pick up on lingo and accents slowly. Ahhh...we'll have to pull it out of me when I come back. The girls here are great, and the guys are...well some of them are amazingly cool, most are just perverted. But it's all good. There are a few who are really cool.   4. The Administration I guess you could call it. Anyways, the people in charge are hella* cool.(* hella= really- lingo I picked up from hanging with the California boy). They basically let us do whatever we want within reason. They're all college students, so they totally relate, but keep us under control.  5. The campus. It's BEAUTIFUL! Trust me, it is. It's really nice here and it also has the aspects of a city. Ice cream and Thomas Sweets and Palmer Square and Starbucks are just a walk away. Well, everything is just a walk away. It's such a nice change.  6. Campus Lifestyle. It was strange the first couple of days, but now it's great. We walk everywhere, which is great exercise haha. We eat between classes, we do homework starting after bedchecks at like 11:30, run around the dorms, stress together, it's great. I'm used to this schedule and then on Sundays we're totally free to roam Princton and do whatever crazy stuff we can think of. There are dances, which don't totally suck, and tons of things to do in a nice city like this. I might rethink my idea of living in a small, college town like Stanford. There's no TV. I thought that'd be a problem, but actually, with so much to do for classes and so much to do in town and around, your free hours are taken up and you don't need TV. I don't even miss it. What else? I don't know. Just the life of a college student minus the alcohol...which I doubt I'll add later...is great.   7. I'm adjusted, and I don't get lost. For those of you who really know me, you know I'm a total dork when it comes to directions, but you know what? I haven't gotten lost once. After just one day, I was leading other people around. Maybe, college life is my niche. Who knows?  There are tons more reasons for which I could go on about how amazing this place is, but I gotta get some researching done for my speech on Monday for Political Comm.   Let's just sum up and say this place rocks and it's only been one week so far. I can see why they say the friendships you forge, you'll never forget. These kids are an interesting, diverse bunch of people. It's a great experience and it's funny how fast you get to know people and open up when you're thrown into a situation like this one.
