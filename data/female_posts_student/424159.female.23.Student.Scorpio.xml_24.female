A rather large pile of envelopes was then shoved into my hand by Jake with the instructions that I was supposed to run these by the post office for dad.  Needless to say, the envelopes had stamps, but they had no return address.  I shrugged, dropped him off at school, and took the letters home to take care of the no return address drama.  Appearantly, I was supposed to mail these letters out, return address or not, because the collection time at the Post Office is 8 am.  Dad bitches at me, I bitch at Joe, my other brother, and Dad bitches at Joe.  At this point, it's 7:30 am and the bitch fest has already begun.  I am not too pleased at this point.  Not only do I STILL have to get ready to leave for the day myself, but now I have to go to the fucking Post Office before 8.  My car payment is due tomorrow and I hadn't sent that out yet.  An hour later, the mail has long been taken care of and I'm on my way to school.  I went to class, found out I kicked total ass on the last Physics quiz (which I guessed on 3 of 5 questions), and then I mailed off my car payment.  At this point, my day shot to a 6.  I rode the bus to the Union to stuff myself on some good Mexican Food (Taco Maker), then headed to the library to look over some Physics stuff.  I am now in the library's computer lab, wasting time untill my next class, which is my 3:30 Hebrew class.  I'm hoping my day stays decent.  More later.
