If only i can turn back time: i would wanna change all the mistakes that i made... erase all the unhappy things... if only i could turn back time: i would study harder  try to get into a better school... If only i could turn back time: i would believe i have the confidence to face ppl with my frizzy hair..  If only i could turn back time: I would persuade God to give me a better life.. not one filled with angst and sadness, and happiness and fun at the same time... If only i could turn back time: there's nothing more than i could wish for now...  wad's been down has been done... the emotional changes in me is visible.. the horrible experiences i have faced is still etched deeply in my heart. The sadness  joy some events brought to me still linger... I will nv forget some of my most unforgettable experiences.... which i have nv enjoyed in my entire life... due to my UDS.... and my lack of self-confidence...... when will i have the courage to stand up in front of ppl as a different person.. when will i have the chance to allow ppl to see the different me? When will i be given this chance to allow ppl to admire me instead of looking down on me? WHEN WILL THAT DAY COME?  LPY
