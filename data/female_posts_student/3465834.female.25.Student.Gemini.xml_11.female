Carrie inspired meas she always does: "soul-mate, two small words one profound statement" and it got me to thinking. As it did her may I add, is there really such a thing as a soul mate? Is there really one person for all of us? I mean, I can admit, I've been in love, I was fortunate to know that feeling, but soul mate seems so ever lasting and so unatainable. Maybe we make people out to be our soul mates because they somehow have a quality we would like to have in ourselves or maybe we think someone is our soul mate because we can't have them and they somehow seem better then they actually are. Are we all wearing rose coloured glasses when were single and it comes to dating? Why then when you finally have a boyfriend are those rose coloured glasses suddenly very, very clear and there aren't any roses at all?  Does having a boyfriend make you part of a soul seeking elite group? Or are you more a member of that group when you're single? Do you ever know? Is that why people get engadged? Or is it maybe because you just found someone you're comfortable sharing your life with? Are there boundaries to each relationship even the soul-mate one's? Should you not let down your boundaries in order to persue a true realtionship? Should you give it your all even if you don't think you see a future with someonein case that person is your soul mate?  Truth be told I just don't know anymore... I used to think that there was that someone for each of us, that one person that you just sort of fit with. But, I think now that I've found a couple grey hairs, some wrinkles, and had my 25th birthday, it might be time to be a little more realistic and not turn down the little less then perfect guys and pay attention to the "nice" one's. I have this image in my head when I think of growing old with someone, sometimes it's a specific person and other times its just an image. Like a white picket fence,and a bunch of babies running around - hunh, who knows for sure. Well that's all for now, I'll give this boyfriend thing a test run, but who knows... He's not my type, but he is nice...
