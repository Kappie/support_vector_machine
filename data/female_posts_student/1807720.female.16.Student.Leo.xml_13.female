Lucky pennies really are lucky cause yesterday morning I found one on heads up.  I did awesome on my Chem test compares to other marks - I got a 74% but like that is really good for me right now and I studied like mad for that test.  And Britt just called!!!  I haven't talked to her in ages!!  She goes to Scarlet and stuff and we just had like a big long talk for an hour!  Today me and Alex went out for lunch and then we met up with Tyler, Ash, Sarah,  Ali, Lenny, and Trav.  I hope I don't gain like tons of weight cause well I couldn't resist the temptation and I HAD to get a chocolate brownie Frap.  God was that ever good and well I drank that thinking I would just skip supper and it would make up for all the calories but then I get home and my mom had ordered my fav. pizza - bacon and tomato and well I HAD to have some of that.  So yeah basically I feel like really guilty cause I had way to much food today and well that ain't good.  But well I had such a good time today and Chels wasn't there.  No one to fight with means no one to upset me and it actually was really nice.  Instead of speding all my time with chels I spent it with everyone else and it was so awesome.  I think my and Alex might have something between up - the romantic chemistry is totally there and he wants to walk with me to school one day even though it will be a long walk from my house.  Everything was just so awesome today and I even did the Chem lab like really well too cause for once I understood the directions and I actually felt like I did that lab without any help and like after I even cleaned out all the beakers for the teacher for her next class and well I stayed a bit later and the Chem teacher told me I didn't have to do it but it felt good to contribute to something and I felt like I could actually help with something for once.  It was nice.  I'm happy at the moment and everything seems like it is going well.  To be honest Chels is alright but I had way more fun with out her.  It is sad to say but is true.  When we are not around each other we don't argue or disagree, I think for now it might be better for us to be apart.  Me and her are both going through alot of different and difficult times and well I think we just can't deal with all of it and it causes us to argue.  Besides I feel like I am getting to know my other friends in a greater depth.     Future and Past  These days are different Comes with a new foundation For times have been not so vast Searching for this sharp content  Then I saw the wrong,  Now I see the right Looking back in history, Shall not dwell on each date  Craft a future for what you crave In your spirit, one can recognize Where the heart slumbers in aspiration Only you know where you want to go  Take the stairs one step at a time Acquire the understanding of determination Know that amid willpower you can grasp a hold  Anything is probable, everything hugs potential  Lacking friends with choices firm Not one to steer, simply yourself to depend People transform and people depart Whether future or past, just follow your heart  ~Vanessa
