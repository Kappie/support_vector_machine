I'm in a working mood, which is good :) and it will let me concentrate on stuff to actually use my time effectively... and not think about stuff thats gonna make me sulky etc. whoa longest sentence ever!  I'm drinking 'cookies and cream' flavoured tea. its yummy :) I love tea, its so relaxing. i need to relax atm, lol.   One other thing we really need to do is yearbook stuff. I'm glad we are doing it because i want a good yearbook, to remember everything, but classes arent handing in their pages >:( bah, very irritating. People don't realise that we neeeed their input too! It's kinda rude when they just expect a yearbook to appear out of nowhere. we can't throw in pages that dont exist... aaaaanyway my rant over. i need to go write about the immune response  toodles  oh and one more thing... i got 80% on my extension speech. i feel a bit ripped off, but its not a bad mark.
