We've seen our loved ones in their decline. We've had to accept that they won't be fine. Some of us had to say good bye, To a long time loved one, and we've all cried. But there have been times in this past year, That certain events have brought us cheer. If it were possible that a wish could come true, Then this is my New Year's wish for you. May the coming year be full of hope, And may we be given the strength to cope. And now at the close of another year, My friends, I wish you a Happy New Year!
