Im thinking bout redoing my own website. When? ahh Idk.   On a non-website or prom note  My brother, mom and I went to see Mona Lisa smile today. I thought it was a pretty good movie. It's sad though, very sad. Im glad I live in the end 90's/00's decade. I can be crappy and selfish as a woman, and people will just shrug it off as pre-menopausal or hormones.   Well-  I gtg. Movies are calling.
