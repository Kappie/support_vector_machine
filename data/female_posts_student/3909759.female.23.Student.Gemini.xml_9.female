Only in Paris do I feel content watching life pass me by. Elsewhere, life feels like a race: I am in a constant race against time against love against myself ...  It feels like a brief pause when I am in Paris: alone roaming Jardin du Luxembourg, alone exploring the labrinth of the Quartier Latin alone climbing the steps to Sacre Coeur where I may look out on a city that is physical poetry that is love in the form of buildings in the form of culture. I'd ask you if you'd like to see pictures of me in Paris, but surely they'd bore you. Afterall you are in some sort of unexplainable rush to nowhere inparticular.
