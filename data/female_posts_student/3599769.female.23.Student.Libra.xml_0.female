I've been trying since yesterday afternoon. No luck, I've looked everywhere for help. So now I'm reaching out to anyone who reads and might help. Next, I have this sideblog thingy, but when I saw it on another site it looked really cool, and it just doesn't on mine. How do I box it in and make it bold or more defined? I know I have more questions but for now if anyone can please help me out with these, I'd appreciate it a thoasund flowers. Oh, yeah one more thing, how the hell do i set up sound on here? I've been to some blogs where you open up the page and music is playing!!! How is that done? or is that out of my league? Thanks.
