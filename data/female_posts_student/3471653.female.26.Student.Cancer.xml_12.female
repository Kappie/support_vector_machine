The other half say that it's neither pointed nor compassionate, and that it's not funny either.  Interestingly, the disagreement doesn't necessarily fall along the  urlLink  Christian  vs.  urlLink  non-Christian  lines you'd expect.  So who's right?     If you've seen it, share the wisdom!  Matt and Beth don't have $12 to spend on a bad movie...
