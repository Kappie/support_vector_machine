While 6 drinks is not that much, the chinese food was the crazy x-factor that lead to me driving home at 2 a.m. confused and sad (though I'm not sure there was anything to be confused or sad about), getting upset over a miscommunication amongst friends and then waking up at 6 a.m. and puking everywhere.  Its almost 7 a.m. now, I still feel drunk, I can't call out, I don't want to eat anything.  All I can do is pray that I can get the consultant out of the building by noon and use comp time I earned by going to last night's meeting to come home and try and recover.  Ugh.  Please put a bullet in my head....thats only in tha mawnin'
