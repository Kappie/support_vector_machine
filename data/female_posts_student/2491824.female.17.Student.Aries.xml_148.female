I was about to give up on connecting this afternoon, when, voila!, I was online!  ...It's mega slow though... Well, just Teoti and MSN's email.... The only two site that I really go to.. ...Except this... Blogger didn't seem to bad... But I was fiddling with my speakers while it was loading, so I don't really know.  ...My speakers aren't working... They are plugged in.. The power light is on... And they are plugged into the correct place on the back of the computer.... I even plugged them in every possible place that they could go, just in case I was having some terrible lapse in memory/intelligence...  I am dying without music, or even the sound of people signing on and off...  Stupidness...  ...But, hey!, I'm online!   Update: I'm an idiot. I had the speakers muted via the 'Mute' button on the keyboard... I guess I muted it while on the phone yesterday then forgot about... I'm dumb.
