Then we were going to go see a movie but my Dad needed the van so we just went to the mall for a while and then I drove Chels home.  It was neat today and really cool.  I feel so independent.  It was just Chels and I in the vehicle - It was cool and I drove by myself for a while too like before I picked her up and just after I dropped her off.  I love driving.  It's so much fun!!!  Yesterday I also ate hard turkey!  LOL.  See my Mom was cooking it and she put in the thermometer that measures turkey and stuff and like it was way lower than it should be to be done but we had been waiting til seven at night so my Mom just cut off the top layers and put it in the microwave for like four minutes.  My turkey was hard!  It was good though and well at least it was food!  Also I love that song by Lindsey Lohan (Drama Queen/That Girl) It's sooooo good!!  She is like one of my newest role models.  So basically my main ones are:  Britney Spears, Hilary Duff, Lindsey Lohan, and some other people that I have met throughout my lifetime.
