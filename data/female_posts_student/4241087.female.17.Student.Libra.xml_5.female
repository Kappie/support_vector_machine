Even though everyone there knows my biggest mistakes from the rumors they heard in the halls of my high school. I would give up the car, the new furniture that my parents bought, UPJ, all the guys who think I'm something. There isn't a single thing I wouldn't give up to be back in Washington.  Here I have everything that isn't important and nothing that is. Sure I have possessions now and a reputation that I would have died for before. It's nothing. It's nothing compared to being alone. Sure, I have my family and a few people I've met along the way, but they aren't to be trusted with my deepest and most precious thoughts. No, they'd just hurt me and have hurt me. It's probably my fault anyways...  And the lack of privacy is becoming a big problem.      "Home, is this a quiet place where you should be alone? Is this where the tortured and the troubled find their own? I don't know, but I can tell this isn't you, your cover's blown But oh no, don't you dare hang up this phone  Hey! Give me space so I can breathe Give me space so I can sleep Give me space so you can drown in this with me" -Something Corporate
