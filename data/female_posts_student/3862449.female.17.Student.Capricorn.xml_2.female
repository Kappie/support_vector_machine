I had to use a different database to find some of the lesser know sources, but managed to get all the information. I visited ally down in the basement when i went to get some hot chocolate from the machine, and she showed me the tests, and data she was working with. She was doing something with beads in different sized cylinders and computing ratios. I think she was modeling different types of soil.
