I think my new font size will be extra small. so for todays word of the day (i used to have a song of the day but i got lazy and theres waaay more words than songs) is Stigmata. the definition for Stigmata is as follows: bodily marks or pains resembling the wounds of the crucified Christ and sometimes accompanying religious ecstasy. Wow, what a cool word. I think it sounds kinda neat too, and it is the title of a very stupid movie. Anyways, I have a new activity that i hate. Mowing the lawn. No wait, i mean mowing MY lawn. To any of you who have had the great honor of being in my backyard, you will know that it is this big huge wonky S (with the addition of a sloped front yard). AHHH it was murder. well not murder, just a real pain in the butt because of all the curves. Why couldnt my yard be shaped normally, like a square? whyyyy!? Anyways, being the nerd that i am, i am a part of the StarWars mailing list (pushes glasses up nose with index finger) and yesterday i recieved a wounderful letter stating that the new starwars movie will be called (in full title) Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. i woudl just like to say George, your losing your touch. The old names left a bit to the imagination (think a A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back) by makign you  think  about what was going to happen in the movie. I dunno Revenge of the Sith seems... gay. We all know who the Sith lord is (and if you dont, you are living a very meanignless life) so why does Lucas have to give it away. why didnt he call it 'Anakin knocks up Amidala, she had twins, He goes over to the dark side'. No wait, that defeated the purpose of leaving it to the imagination...       ...         ...well he should take a few lessons from the harry potter lady, (j.k. rowling) and pick cool names. Like the new one (book 6 i think were at?) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Now that sounds cool. But at the same time im pissed cuz i have no clue who this 'prince' could be. she should dumb-it-down for us.         ... great i contradicted myself         ...crap          xoxo Leslee
