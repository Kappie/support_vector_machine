It: They're all lying to you Me: All of them? It: They're all out to get you. If you don't come with me they'll destroy you. Me: They won't destroy me but you will  It: That is not true I am your friend. Don't you remember me my child? Me: No why would I remember you? It: If you come with me I'll tell you. Me: Then forget it. I have people I love here It: Like Scott. Didn't he dump you. He's just lying to you so you won't go and kill yourself. He feels sorry for you just like everyone else. I could love you - all you need is me. Me: He loves me you don't. You're not real. Besides we got back together. It: He won't even stay up with you. That's not love bitch that's hatred. Me: No if he would have stayed up I would have been controlling him and that's not what I want It: Why not control him? Me: Because he has his own mind. And I want him to be happy. I love him. It: ha you actually love someone. You'll hurt him just like you have every other guy that tried to love you. You push everyone who actually wants to be a part of your life. You make yourself miserable. You whore! You'll get him to hate you. Me: I'm not going to push him away like I have with others. I'm happy with him. I love him. He keeps me sane. It: Sane! You think you're sane. Look at you curled up in a ball, not being able to control you're own thoughts. You want to die, you wish for it, you dream about it, you can just almost taste it. Me: That's not true... anymore. It: How can something die like that. Just get it over with... end it all. Come with me. You will no more feel the cold stabbing pain. No more crying, no more curling up in balls on the floor, no more. Me: Yeah no more anything. Just total blackness and I don't think I want that. I want to live so just leave me be. It: I can't do that. Me: And why not. It: Because I am you.
