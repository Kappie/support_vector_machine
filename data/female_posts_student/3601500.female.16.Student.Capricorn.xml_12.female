So, Wednesday I'll be leaving to Quebec with my little sisters; it's a 6:15 hours long bus ride. Blah. Then, I'll probably pull an all-nighter catching up on the FMA episodes I missed (my sister's got them downloaded). Will be seeing Shadow too, I expect. I never see him enough to my taste, though, considering he's supposed to be my horsie. And then, we leave to NB, which is I think another 6+ hours long ride? My dad doesn't even know if we'll go to Moncton -- my sister and I would go by to visit Yan and Ricky, maybe I'd say hello to Renelle (my childhood best friend). Next Monday, my dad's girlfriend and her two girls will join us to grandma's house, and we'll be leaving that weekend. I have to be there by Monday, since I have to monitor the horseback riding camp. Money.   Hm, yah, money. My lessons are getting expensive, and I don't know if next year I'm babysitting. When I get to University, I'll probably drop my lessons anyway, but I plan to go to Quebec in the summer vacation (yay 4 months!). I'll be able to ride Shadow. I might get a job there, too, so I can buy a English-riding saddle or something. I'll be happy to live in the basement with my sister (oldest, I'll call her kalika) - I'll bring my computer, hee.  And we're going to the con after all! Kalika said we'd be sharing our hotel room with sisters she knows from her lj. Also, we'll be cosplaying Ed (me) and Al (restored) from FMA - the coats and shirts will cost 300$, and she's paying 200$ (...she insisted). Since she got money, she also decided she's pay for eveything except my ticket to the con and my share of the hotel fee (and whatever I want to buy myself). I  .> Oh, right, now I'm freaked out because Kalika joined the Subby forum. *groans* She hasn't posted, so maybe it's just to keep an eye on stuff... -.-  Well on the bright side, the FMA wallscrolls and keychains (Roy, Ed, Al) we ordered from Ebay should arrive at around the time we're back from NB (also, our coats will be ready). I'm floating on a cloud, and I don't want to fall back to Earth.
