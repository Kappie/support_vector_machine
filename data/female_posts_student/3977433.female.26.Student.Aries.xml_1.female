Maybe all this work will get rid of my fat ass.   I have to go back in at 3pm today cause I guess they're super busy. I honestly don't mind. It's more hours, and at 10$ /hr it's not like I can complain. All I do is play with bread all day. *squishy*  Um, not sure what I'm doing tonight, as that is still pretty much up in the air. I just know that for now, I'm going to read a few chapters and then swim before work again...I'm so damned hot.   I hope everyone is having a good day.
