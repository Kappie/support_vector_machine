Ummm ... Our friendship is NEVER going to work out, so it's good that we ended it now! Well, I'm that she told me how she feels!  And I'm glad that she ended it now, instead of waiting forever!  Oh wait, she did wait forever!  She's been my friend for almost a year ... and she waited until now to end it!  What a waste of 11 months!  I've been the same person since the day she met me!  So she should have ended it starting day one!  ... So I was watching That 70s Show, and there was a fairy and he asked Eric if he wanted to erase Donna from his memory, because he could make it possible!  And Eric said no because the memories he has of her are so happy and he would never trade them in for anything!   So I was trying to think if I just wanted to delete Ashleigh out of my memory or not!  I don't think it's possible to do so, buf if I could what would I do?  I DON'T KNOW!  So I'm gonna put together a list of good times and bad times and which ever one wins will decided what I would do!  GoOd TiMeS: * Meeting Ashleigh (June 10th) ... Hippy Braids in hair, Hippy Skirt!  Woo! * Hanging out at the skatepark 24/7 * Hanging out at the movies every Friday and Saturday night * Trick or Treating and stealing an item from every house * Chicken Quesadilla's from Taco Bell, yummie! * Being introduced to Rachel, Emily, and Jesi * Ditching work nonstop to hang out with her * "The Kr3w" * Massive amounts of fun sleepovers * Watching Kyle "hold" her, thats it * Nathan going out with me (All thanks to Ashleigh, she made it happen) * Attempting to ditch school with all of them * Going out with Kyle (Wouldn't have met him without her) * Going out with Ben (She found out from him that he liked me!) * Panera * Numerous "First Times" * Following Miles car around, not knowing it was him * Being chased by the LITH cops after Sean Hickey stole a bottle from Dom. * Walking home in the SCARY rain * Freaky Friday, with Nathan!  AHh! * Sneaking into Mean Girls * Getting over my fear of Freddie Kruger (Seeing Freddie vs. Jason) * Fish and Maggot * "I'm addicted to you ..." * "So I said why don't you and I get together ..." * Kissy Kissy * Paper Clip  BaD tImEs: * Telling her I didn't need her when I was drunk * Stealing Emily away from her?  ... Leads to fight! * Stealing Jesi away from her?  ... Leads to fight! * Stealing Rachel away from her?  ... Leads to fight! * Secretly being in love with Joe * Going out with her brother * Sleeping in the basement with him * Giving Kyle stuff ... * Bitching at her * Her bitching at me * Me treating her like crap * Her treating me like crap (even if she didn't realize it) * Her obsessing over Joe, blaming me for problems * Not hanging out with her for a month and a half * Not talking to her for a long time after Kyle broke up with me * Best Friend Times Infinity Infinity = HELL * Having the LITH cops call my house because I talked to Ruby about Ashleigh (No threats by me were made) * Doing stuff with Kyle when he was still going out with Vanessa * Ashleigh going to Jacobs  * Ashleigh meets Erin = No need for Stefanie * Erin hating Stefanie for no reason * Erin calling Stefanie and bitching because Steff and Ash are in a fight * My mom not letting me go to Ash's house, but able to go to other people's house = Problems with Ash cause she thinks Im lying * Tiffany - Pig Face  Wow, surprise surprise, there is more good than bad!  But isn't there always?  Oh well, it doesn't matter!  Even if there were more bad times I could never forget about her!  God, I'm sick of the stupid fights!  It's bullshit!  I really don't need this right now, I have enough problems at home and at school ... I don't need to get shit from her too!    ... ULTIMATE best friends is DEAD!
