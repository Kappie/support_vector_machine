So I'm talking to Tayler today and he asks me if I was in cheerleading when I was little. I'm thinking oh shit..... yeah I was. So he starts laughing so a girl I once knew named kylie was on the squad and idk he just found out I was a retard on the squad. I hope you all can forgive me, I do NOW know how dumb girls sound when they say they are a cheerleader. but the point I'm trying to make is Tayler forced me to do a time warp, open the photo albums and look back. I know it sounds corney but it's crazy how much I've changed and how little I"ve changed all in the same time..... okay it wasn't corney just kinda WTF? So if you guys don't mind get out some yearbooks from high-school, pictures from grade school, ect out and look back, it gives you a really fucked up feeling that you can't get rid of. I looked at all us little cheerleaders, I saw girls from my high school now back in 1996it's nuts. I looked at dance class pictures too, those holy shit. The moms got to pic out our costumes. We looked like show girls eacha and every year, I swear. Straight up hookers....lol great times though.
