I worked on getting into my blog for about 45 minutes before giving up and using the photo route to post an entry and now...my blog works. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! How frustrating! It is time for bed...Last night I ended up only getting 2 hours and 20 minutes of sleep. Between Shawn and Nick sprawling out, I don't have any room in my bed! It is getting to be time to move Nick into his perfectly fine and close crib  or  get a much  bigger  bed!
