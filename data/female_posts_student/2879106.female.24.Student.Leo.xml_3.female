My Boyfriend (who I love so much) is the biggest jerk in the whole world. He was so selfish!!! Last night he never once thought to make V-Day special for me. I understand that he doesn't have much $$$$$ But I don't really ask for much. I just wanted a quite night TOGETHER!!!! Not a night of me watching TV and him ignoring my while he looks at his computer. What makes it worse is that today when I talked to him, he had no clue I was even mad. I guess I cry myself to sleep whenever I am truly happy!!(He is so clueless!!) OH well I guess that's what I get for falling in love with a selfish jerk. Sorry hunny if you are reading this but this is all true. Well That's all for now. Thanks for listening to me vent. I really appreciate it!! Love alway's
