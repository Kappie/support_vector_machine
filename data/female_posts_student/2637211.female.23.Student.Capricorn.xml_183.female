So the work ethic is not so much for the moment. But I have to finish the book, then write a paper... the plan is to get the book done today and the paper done tomorrow, and hopefully I'll have time to get through the book about Spain too. But first, Black Elk Speaks and his impressions of Americans... hmm.
