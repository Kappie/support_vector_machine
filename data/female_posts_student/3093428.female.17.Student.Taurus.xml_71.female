Like how I did when Matt posted about this very topic.  Yesterday was amusing. Anne, Dyllan, Matt, my bro and I went swimming and it was so fun! Matt and I started a competition/game where someone threw a quarter and then we had to race to get it back from the bottom of the deep, dark, dangerous pool. It was rad until I scraped my elbow on the bottom of the pool. Actually, I think that wasn't from the game, but that's okay. Then we sat in the sauna for a long time and it was gross. Dyllan's gross. And then we got locked in for awhile. But that's okay 'cause we were broiling. :)  And yeah, Andrew, what's going on this Wednesday? I'm too lazy to e-mail you, so I'm hoping you check this regularly.
