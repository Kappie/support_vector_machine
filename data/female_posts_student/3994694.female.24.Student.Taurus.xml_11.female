I’ve started with the boring stuff – transcriptions of interview notes into a legible and typed format, an outline of my research area with appropriately inserted references to official government documents. And then I even headed up a section ‘The community” and sat and looked at it flickering on my computer screen for two or three hours. The community!! What the hell am I doing with a little section heading numbered 4.2, with a budget of 500 words to discuss the concept of ‘community’ from the point of view of my ‘participants’. How can hours of laughter, discussions and friendship-building be coldly described as ‘observation’ and ‘interviews’?  What do you think of this?  4.2 The Community  Oh web of complex and spectacular historical interactions! Are you the elusive Community that I seek? Who is that I research? Can a place name ever contain the spirit and soul of its inhabitants? Can a group of human interactions ever be confined to a place? If you displayed your contents to the literary world, would not my own name be also inscribed alongside them, who, in the academic world must have separate nomenclature in the holy trichotomy of Researcher, Particpants and Non-participants?
