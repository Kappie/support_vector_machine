I ignored this odd feeling most of the day, but found it cropping up this afternoon at work.  for once I was content to sit back and watch the game unfold, instead of trying to stop it.  The class was loud and everyone shouting, yet I was sitting there with a grin on my face, not doing anything.  After work I went and met this new family i'm babysitting for on saturday, they were cool and by then I was back to being myself.  I don't know what's up with these weird antisocial lazy moods, but they need to go away.
