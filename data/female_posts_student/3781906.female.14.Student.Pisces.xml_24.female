For my own perposes, I'll leave a list here. Please pray for me!  1- Apathy 2- Anger 3- Jealousy 4- Pride 5- Depression 6- Resentment of my elders 7- Gossip 8- Lying 9- Malcontent 10- Disbelief 11- Lack of Faith 12- Loose tongue 13- Self-demeaning thoughts  In the next few mintutes I will be sending and e-mail that I should have sent a long time ago. Talking to my friend and praying about it made me see that. Thank you Lord for revealing yourself to me tonight.
