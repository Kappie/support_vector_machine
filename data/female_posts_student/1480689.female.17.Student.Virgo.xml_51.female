" yea nate we have a I hate nate  but we think of ways to make him think we like him club. we uh meet 2 times a week on Tuesdays.... (pause.)..........both in the morning and at night." " you totally caught your mistake didn't you adam." " yes, yes i did."  mutant flies. ah.  hopefully today things will work and we'll get a big group pf people together. :-/ then i can leave that big group and go to work, ahhhh.  singing the starting line, when you know 2 phrases of the song, makes you look REAL dumb. yea. :-D  in one of those moods that makes ya wanna hug  everybody!  bbye
