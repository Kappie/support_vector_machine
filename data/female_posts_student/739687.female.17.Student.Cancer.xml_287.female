You'd think an assload of aleve would help that sort of thing, but it just makes me feel sick and makes me want to pass out.  God, my birthday's in 3 days (closer to two days actually), and I'm not the least bit excited. I think I just don't have a very positive attitude today. I need to lose this skeptic-persona, and try enjoying my life a bit. I'll do that tomorrow. Maybe.  I still think God hates me. Really, I do. He's definately out to get me. Or I guess my constant bad luck is just an odd coincidence. Either that or satan is being a bastard, and God is either sitting back laughing at me or he doesn't exist. You know, I don't really care. Religion is a dependency, and I think it's just human nature. We have to find some sort of meaning for everything, some sort of reward for life that follows death. Otherwise I guess people wouldn't see a true purpose in living. I mean, throughout history you have these intellectuals and philosophers who have these great prophecies about some great destiny or some all-powerful being or force that controls everything. Then they gather followers, because they're ideas are so convincing. And different people are attracted to different philosophies. All it takes is a great, convincing leader. Look at Confucius, Jesus, Mohammed...they're just prophets with different philosophies on life. Philosophies that perhaps they invented in hopes for finding some purpose and meaning. Hell, look at Hitler. That man was one of the greatest leaders of our time. His views weren't necessarily on a religious level (nor were they humane), but he felt a conviction for them, and he conveyed his message, and people followed. Basically, people just need something to believe in. I personally, can't say that I have anything that I believe in. I can't really say that, at this point in my life, I need anything. The only thing that truly comforts me is knowing that I have the opportunity to leave something behind me. All I care about in life is impacting people long after I'm gone.  Sorry if I've offended anyone with my "Religion is a dependency" speech. Actually, I'm not sorry. It's my opinion, and I'm not shoving it down your throats. I respect people's decisions about their religion, and infact I admire people that have strong convictions about their religion. So if you throw some royal fit about what I just said, I'm not going to bicker like some immature child, but I'm probably not going to care either. My opinion is mine, yours is yours. So go ahead and spill it to me, but don't shove it down my throat. I don't know many people that do that, in fact I really don't have run-ins with people like that, but just in case any decide to pop up, this is forwarning that I'm open to conversations, not lectures.  *Well, I feel like I'm in a better mood now. Odd.*  Oh, The Hulk is possibly one of the worst movies ever created. The plot is so barely-there, and you can't go anywhere with it. I wanted to stab myself in the face, because it was that awful. I'm typically not a big movie critic, and I usually like most anything I see.... but it sucked.  God almighty, it's plot-line was so shallow and dull that you couldn't have saved the movie if you tried.  Well, that's all I have to say for now.  Don't ever ever see The Hulk, crazies.
