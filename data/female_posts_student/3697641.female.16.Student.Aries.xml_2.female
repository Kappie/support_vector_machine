I snapped today.  Everything broke apart and I let go.  It felt so good, and so bad I want to be sick.  I don't know what I'm doing.   is this the diary of a crazy woman?    I wish it would just end.  Everything.  All the wanting...  God, the wanting.  It shouldn't be like this.  I shouldn't feel this way.  How can you make me feel like this?  I don't know.  It's a crazy state of being.  I don't understand.  And you won't give me a chance.    So good bye.  Tomorrow is the day I turn everything right side up.  I'm shaking you loose.  If I can...   "I'm everything you want I'm everything you need I'm everything inside of you that you wish you could be I say all the right things at exactly the right time but I mean nothing to you and I don't know  w  h  y"
