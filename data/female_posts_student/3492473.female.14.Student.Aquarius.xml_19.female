I was like  HELL NO!  The inhaler helped me everywhere else but running! And running is really what I need it for! I play soccer and run track, I need to be able to run! God, if I can't play soccer, I swear,  I'll go crazy . Now I have to go to my doctor and do all these because they thought I had sports-induced asthma but I guess I don't or I wouldn't have felt that bad within 2 minutes...
