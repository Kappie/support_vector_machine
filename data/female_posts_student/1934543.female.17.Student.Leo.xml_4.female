As i am just the only one thats awake at this time it sucks too, because i would love to just run thorugh the house yelling, just for the sake of yelling. Well  i hope that everybody in the midwest gets some good night of sleep and for now that was ME with a few words of wisdom. GOOD NIGHT (?or are you already sleeping?)
