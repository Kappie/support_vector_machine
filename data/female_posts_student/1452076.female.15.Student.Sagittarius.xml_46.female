I heard the punk rock version by New Found Glory somewhere last year when I first discovered them. These lyrics are adapted from the NFG version because Astraweb has yet to post the version by North. I don't think the lyrics should differ much (There's another version by B.B. King and Bette Milder). Nice ballad anyway, go listen.       Tonight it's very clear     As we're both lying here     There's so many things i want to say     I will always love you     I would never leave you alone          Sometimes i just forget     Say things i might regret     It breaks my heart to see you crying     I don't wanna lose you     I could never make it alone     I am a man who will fight for your honor     I'll be the hero you're dreaming of          We'll live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love          You'll keep me standing tall     You'll help me through it all     I'm always strong when you're beside me     I have always needed you     I could never make it alone     I am a man who will fight for your honor   urlLink      I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of     We'll live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love          Just like a knight in shining armor     From a long time ago     Just in time i will save the day     Take you to my castle far away     I am a man who will fight for your honor     I'll be the hero you're dreaming of          We're gonna live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love     We'll live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love          We did it all for love     We did it all for love     We did it all for love     We did it all for love
