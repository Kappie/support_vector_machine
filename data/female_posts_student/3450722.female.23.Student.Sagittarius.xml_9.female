The first day I was there, I was depressed.  It was cold, windy, and rainy.  But, Karen assured me this was not the normal weather.  Karen's apartment is absolutely awesome... it's on Lakeshore Dr. and it overlooks the city (which stretched for miles and miles and never seemed to end).  I'll post my pics as soon as I get them developed.  The bars there are pretty cool... they're kinda like the bars here in good ole K-town, except with a lot of cute (and better dressed) northern boys.  Michegan Avenue shopping was definitely the highlight of my trip... let's just say that they have all of the stores I adore, except way better sales than in Atlanta (where I normally do all my shopping).  Lake Michegan is gorgeous, and I loved the weather for the rest of the weekend.  It was sunny and breezy... not muggy and humid like Tennessee's unpredictable weather.  That town definitely has a lot to offer a girl... but it is a tad bit expensive to live there.  I'd have to find a really, really good job before making "the big move."  Oh, and one thing that really got on my nerves was that everywhere I went... and I"m talking about EVERYHERE... everyone asked if I was from Georgia or South Carolina.  Do they not know Tennessee is in the South?  I know I have a very strong southern accent, but hello?  Some people could not get over it!  I was asked in the bathroom at a bar, in a gas station, and even at the airport getting my luggage!  Which, by the way, I am never flying out of Nashville again!  It was way too much of a hassle.  But, overall Chicago was really wonderful!  I'm definitely considering it on my search of jobs at Monster.com!
