We should leave now before they spot us  "You are right Aldwin," Khala headed for the door and as she did one of the gaurds recognized her and told the other gaurd," Hey you stop where you are."  Run, do not fight them just run we do not want confrontation  Khala heeded Aldwins advice and made a dash for the door all the while dodging a laser shot in the process,"HALT!" The gaurds pursued her out of the bar and down the street. Khala made a right turn down a street, then made a left with laser shot missing her by nanoinches.  She takes another left and comes apon a dead end, "Now what Aldwin, any great ideas now."  Yes climb the wall behind you and you will come out in a main street where you can lose them, I hope "That's reasurring, what the hell," she turns around and starts to scale the wall.   The gaurds round the corner and let out a barrage of shots at the wall almost nocking Khala off.  Khala makes it to the top of the wall and jumps off, but takes a shot in the right leg.  She falls towards the ground and hits and is nocked unconscience.
