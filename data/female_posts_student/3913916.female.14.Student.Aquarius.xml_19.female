I realized I've changed since the day I first entered DLSZ. It came to me that now I've grown up. I became taller, became "smarter," became DIFFERENT! My personality, for example, is really different from before. Outgoing, friendly, boyish. That was ME before. Now, I'm shy, kinda friendly, kinda girly girl. Look what change can do to a person. "Become a student of change. It is the only thing that will remain constant." Anthony J. D'Angelo.  That's really true. But we should at least think before we act. Think of the consequences that may happen if you'll change something. It may be bad or may be good. But as for me, I really didn't see that I was changing. It didn't notice that I was changing. It just came to me that I was not the same as before.  Everytime a flower blooms and then withers away, a new flower blooms and then again, withers. Everytime a flower grows it changes just like me. But, this change doesn't stop there. It continues growing until it blooms. For me, I'm still a closed bud waiting to bloom and then wither in the end. But this kind of life is useless without the sun, water and soil i grow in. These things are someone important to me. Meaning, my loved one. I can't just wither and die without being loved.
