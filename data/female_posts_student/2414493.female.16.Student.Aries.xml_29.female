For some unexplained reason, walking up the driveway was the strangest thing tonight. It's not like I've never done it--I can keenly remember walking down with Z and walking up with D ("Oh man, look at those stars!") but tonight it was the most deliberate walk up to the door. I know it's not right, but every time I think of the front door I'm inclined to recall things...  And once in a while, I'll look back at the picture. There's a reason why I've spent so much (too much, in retrospect) on that dress and then never wore it again, even for silly little stints in front of the mirror when I have too much time on my hands. There's me, with my hair up and blending with the darkness all around, my hands clutching my jacket with the corsage around my wrist, and laughing so hard (from what?) into his chest and his facial expression is a startled one, with the beginnings of a smile for the save. There's some reason why it bothers me still, why I much prefer to admire the one of T and me, same night, same clothes. Maybe it's paranoia (I still convince myself that I did something wrong that night) and I just hate that the picture epitomizes and broadcasts some deep-seated fear--truth, in my mind.  And someone's on the phone tonight. "Hi________, I'm on the phone." And I remember with a frustrated chuckle what I used to do on the phone. I'm glad it's past me, but I just embarrass myself remembering nights on balconies leaning against the rails staring at Tercero C or the other buildings, looking up at the blasted windows of the bathroom and TALKING. Forever. Until stern faces appear in the windows and tell me that it's curfew and I'd better walk the two feet back into my room. What did we use to talk about? What we wanted to do in twenty years. Everything. And maybe that was the closest they ever got to suggesting the one thing that would make me so terrifically happy (or so I thought, at the time). Sprinklers, plates, classes, familiy. And even at home, leaning against the drawers and telling them that I felt scared or stpuid or insecure or just little things to get it out of my system: "I had a dream about you last night."  So E's birthday dinner. Went to Sesame Inn, which is a small place off Wendy in NP...I'm sure I've heard Mom mention it before, but I guess I've never paid much attention. A very small establishment. Cozy. Not the best dinner table conversation ever, but it'll do...what more can I expect? The park across the street from OPHS afterwards for cake and key lime bars, made last night with J. Bitter cold. And then walking home. And you know something's wrong when you're already imagining what you'll write down before you get home.  Things go in circles.  It's hard to tell myself that I'd been having way too much fun before and that I'd better get it in my system now that it's not going to continue much longer. There are just some things, I guess, that I just can't bring myself to accept and the more I hold on, the lamer I feel. Tales of intrigue and betrayal, lol.  I'm thinking "worn-out shoe" now, but that's Chinese slang for prostitute. Maybe that'd be appropriate in this circumstance, too. OH, the scrapes I get myself into.
