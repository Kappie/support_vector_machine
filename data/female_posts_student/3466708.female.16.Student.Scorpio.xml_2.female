No, not really. I'm just easily amused and sucked into all those american shows. Hah. 'tis all good. So yeah there's only like..oooh 16 or so school days left. Fucking eh man. What a relief 'cuz I'm soo ready for summer break to begin. As soon as the weather gets hot I just can't focus in school. It's a good thing I don't live in Florida or something. Hawaii. Yeah, I'd be dumb all year round then.  Anywho..(I hate that saying)I should be going. I have a math test tomorrow and something tells me I need to study for it. Maybe it's the fact that fact that I got 50% on the pretest today. Heheh. OOh maybe I can go driving tomorrow..got my L 2 weeks ago or something and I haven't been yet. I'm sorta nervous. Ahh. I don't want to run over any old ladies. That would actually be quite hard to do..ok well I'm gone. Love you all. Or some of you. Maybe none. Who knows. Who cares. Ciao. xox
