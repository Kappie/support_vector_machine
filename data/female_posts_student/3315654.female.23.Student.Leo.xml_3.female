That or I'll call you for bail money from the federal detention center. heh! Well you know when you don't put enough postage on your envelope or what not. Well they send it back to sender right? Well what if you purposely wrote the sender's address as the address where you want it to go! They' send it back! Which would really send it to where you wanted it to go in the first place. I'm a fucking genious!!!
