Makes absolutely no sense, really. Why doesn't UT simply have graduation ceremonies on the 19th or the 20th, after Seniors are finished with finals? It's kind of difficult to be motivated enough to study when you've already crossed the finish line.  Aaron and Maggie and I studied at Metro this evening. Well...we technically talked more than we studied. ;-) It was nice. They assured me that we would go out and truly celebrate 6th-stree style after finals were over. Sounds good to me--it's high time I took a break.  Hey everybody--the Tower is lit up orange with an '03' on the sides! For some reason I'm monumentally excited about that. They didn't light the tower for me personally, of course, but it feels that way. The whole thing is rather bittersweet, because I doubt I'll be attending UT as a grad student. I still am in shock mode; I can't believe that I have a college degree. I just didn't expect it all to go by so fast! It's a scary thought.  I better go study for my final on Wednesday. Again, this is stupid.
