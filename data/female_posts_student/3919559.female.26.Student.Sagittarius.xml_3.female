We usually go outside and play frisbee for a little while, unless Mean Max the German Shepherd who lives next door is outside.  Then, I have to stay on the leash because I'm not supposed to play with him.  But then, we'll go for a short walk so that I can pee-pee and poopie.  I usually go say hi to my friend Scout, the McCormicks' yellow lab.  He likes to play with me, and he tries to keep up with me, but he's too fat and slow to play very long.  My mommy calls him a "whale" and says that his family doesn't play with him enough.  One morning, there was new dog in our yard, a Jack Russell terrier, so I got to run around with him, too.  He was pretty fast and a lot more agile than me.  We wrestled in the grass when he wasn't hiding under the car!  Then we usually go inside and eat breakfast.  My mommy's pretty tired after working all night, so we take a nap until it gets really hot inside the house.  That's when I wake her up by crawling on her and licking her face.  Later, we get to go outside and have lots of fun.  Sometimes, we go mountainbiking.  Sometimes, it's hiking.  Or we play fetch with the balls and frisbees.  This week, I got to go to two softball games.  I was a very good boy and didn't bark too much during the game.  Sometimes, it's really hard not to though.  On Wednesday, I also got to run around with my friend Basco the Boxer.  He's bigger than me and likes to chew on my neck.  But I just figured out that I can dodge him with quick turns, just like that Jack Russell with me.  We tore all across the outfield after the game was over.  There were other dogs there, too, but I just got to say a quick hi.     Today, we went for a 7-mile mountainbike ride on the Optic Nerve trail in Eagle.  I must be growing because I can run a lot faster now.  I could keep up, even up to 17mph, for short time at least.  Plus, I know when I can get a head start sooner, so I don't get behind.  I like running through all the sage and chasing rabbits on this trail.  The soil was chalky, and when we were done I had white dust all over my face.  I wonder what we'll do tomorrow!  Love, Caesar
