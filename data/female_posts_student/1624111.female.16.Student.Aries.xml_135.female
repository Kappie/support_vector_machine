Actors Gymnasium (jenna and brittany)- this was kinda weird, but somewhat entertaining. actors/acrobats dancing around and doing mimeish things. the doll girls were cool.  Secrets of Swashbuckling (lauren and nikki)- undeniably the best class of the day. didnt actually get to swashbuckle meself, but i sat up close, second row, and watched some awesome demonstrations and was captivated by their lecture. cool guys. funny. learned.  Lunch (michele and heather and emily and jessica and caitlin and rita and olga and...karen)- fun times. Emily!!! thats about all i have to say.  Musical! the musical (emily and kara and jessica and heather and...well, eric)- a little boring, moderately entertaining at times. eric-business very uncool.  i dont feel like explaining that though. damned band friends. and she wonders why i dislike them...  Najawa Dance Corps (jessica and emily and abby)- boring. not very good jessica or emily conversation either. oh well though.   two classes, lunch, and homeroom with emily!!! whoa! amazenering! especially when you consider how random this is and how many people there are! soo yay for that!  and...hmm...what else to say? i dunno. i decided i want to go to the mall with alex and tell him what he should wear if he wants to look good. cause he doesnt now. and...he could. he just wont listen to me. if only!  hmm...and...i dunno. i dont have much to say, really. i need something to look forward to, also. i need to make crazy fun plans for polaski day weekend so that i can wait impatiently for that.  ill have to do all my stupid homework tomorrow, though. erg. oh well. it was worth it to have free days today and yesterday. woo! free!  hehe, and its friday when i have school again, so no homework until sunday. woooooooo.  im gonna go sleep. odyssey is fun. i like seeing emily. i wonder if shell sleepover next weekend? i can hope. dum dee dum dum dum. im tired. i should go to bed.  but im also thirsty. i think ill go have a drink. and then lay out clothes for tomorrow. and then go to bed.  and i wonder if i should bring my backpack tomorrow? i did today and i didnt use it at all...hmmm... i guess ill be needing those siscors. bah. well see.  um...night, then.
