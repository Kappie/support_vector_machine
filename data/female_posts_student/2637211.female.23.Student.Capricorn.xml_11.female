Earlier this week,  urlLink Melissa  and I heard  urlLink Fat Sam's Band  while getting dinner at Pluto's, and I heard an interview with the band on KXJZ this morning. It looks like a lot of fun, and I bet there's more to do than at the  urlLink Stockton Asparagus Festival , the town sponsored event that I grew up with. It involved a lot of beer and deep-fried asparagus, and a lot of cheesy vendors. I assume the Jubilee is much the same, but there'll be music to watch and listen to. Could be good times, so I might talk the boy into going.
