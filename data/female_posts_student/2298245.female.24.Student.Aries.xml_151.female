Costner starts off:   "We shouldn't be attacking a filmmaker like Mel Gibson who, number one, is an honorable filmmaker ... and probably questioned himself more than anybody even knows."   So far, so good.  But then, there is his gem of a conclusion:   "So, like leave him alone."   Well, said, Kevin.  I'm sure Mel will personally call you up and thank you for all your efforts on his behalf.
