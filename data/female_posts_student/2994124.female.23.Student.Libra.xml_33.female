I watched last nights which FORTUNATELY my parents taped as I had asked, which is series 10 and then watched repeat of series 9 this morning.  So I am totally confused about what's happening when after seeing ER in Canada too.  I won't say anything about what happened because Debs might read this and I wouldn't want to spoil the excitement! But I don't think that we are THAT far behind you - about 9 months ER time I am reckoning.  oohh...mustn't forget to get my survivor predictions in....... I've watched the trailer clip for tonights episode but it doesn't really give me any clues. Also the challenge is between the survivor's families so it is harder to predict. So let's recap who we have in: Jenna, Amber, Boston Rob, Rupert, Big Tom, Shi-Ann.  I think its strange how they coincidently have 3 girls and 3 guys...mmmm.....  Right have packed the car, everything is ready, oh I just need to have a shower.  And guess what? suprise, suprise IT'S RAINING!! I thought you said that Vancouver was always wet Melanie!!
