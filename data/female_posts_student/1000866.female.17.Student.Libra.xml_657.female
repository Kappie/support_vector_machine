He called me from U of I. :) Tha was nice of him. MC and I talked too. It was nice of her to say something. It makes me feel a lot better about the whole situation and I know they didn't mean to so, I'm really glad she said something. Haha, this is weird writing this knowing she reads it though. Hi MC!!! :) Haha. So, my day is starting off much better today.
