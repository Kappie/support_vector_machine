Net posted "THIRTEENTH FLOOR", which ends in "R", so I'm posting "RABBIT, RUN", which starts with R.  At least I think it was a movie.  I don't think the sequels became movies, though.  Anyhow, next person has to post a movie that starts with "N".  Oh, and no recycling - you can use the search button to find out if your title's been used before.  Everybody check this out:  urlLink Attention movie buffs
