Maybe that just means I should be done studying for the day.  That's actually not a bad idea, now that I think of it.  I need to get up early and hit it all again.  Today was a good study day (I even raised my overall average to 61%!!!!).  I hope the next three days will be as well - then that is it!  I'm done!  I can't wait.  Of course, now that this is coming to an end, all that other junk is resurfacing in my mind.  Maybe it is just hormones.  I miss my friends.  That's all.  Though I must say, I've had the opportunity to spend more time with several people that I've neglected in the past.  It has been very nice.  People are so cool.  I wish that could be my job: hanging out with people.  That would be ideal.  I only get hungry at night.  I barely eat during the day any more, but hit 10 or 11 pm, and I'm liable to eat... anything, really.  Mmm.  Don't brownies sound good?
