I still suck and am considering giving it up again.  I have also decicded on what i want for a graduation gift.  $100 worth of my fave movies. So far I have SLC Punk.  I cant think of any otehrs i really wana own right now. I am soooooooo bored and there is nothing to do.  There's 1 month and 27 days till my b day! Yay! I find it rather interesting if you give your parents more info than they really need that they have total trust in you. So I say B.S. is in the details.  You wana do something you know you arent allowed to give your parents all the details possible that wont get you in trouble adn they are completely oblivious.  Something thats bugging me right now is the fact that my sister is such adn angel it is jsut unnatural... i know i have talked about this already tho.  There is nothing that she has done wrong accept maybe kissing a guy at a party during truth or dare.  Wow that is scary.  She doesnt use drugs and trys to persuade people that do use to stop, she gets strate A's and has only gotten one B since like 5th grade, does so much volunteer wrok you wonder how she has time for anything else, and oh she is a perfect daughter.  Now you tell me waht is unnatural about that.  Wells that was fun.  Now I am off to find something on tv or maybe watch pitch black or almost famous o! or maybe teh matrix... who else thinks the first one was the best adn only good one?
