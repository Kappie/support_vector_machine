They're those rare boy lips that are actually quite full and voluptuous as opposed to your standard, run-of-the-mill, thin, lizard boy lips.  They're lips that look really amazing and inviting when they're pouty, though he very rarely ever pouts.  They're the kind of lips that are fun to trace the outline of with your tounge and give a quick nibble to as we break our kiss.  Wether its an innocent brush of them against my forehead or somewhere a bit more naughty, they make me shiver.  They're these really cute lips that when he speaks sometimes give him what sounds like a lisp, but isn't and can make even a mumble of nonsense sound sexy.  I feel like sometimes our lips are magnetic becuase they always seem to be locked together.  I can lie in bed with him for hours just kissing with him becuase his lips are that good.  Sometimes we'll press our foreheads to one another and share a quick smooch and then he'll cock his head back and open his mouth revealing his equally as nice teeth and he'll just laugh and squeeze me to him.  In those moments, things are so perfect, that I feel like I could die.
