It's rumored that someone got a little wet at work tonight...quite funny...but very WRONG.  Someone needs to put a really long post on here.  All of these are short! Perhaps that'll be my job for another day.  Our new uniforms are U-G-L-Y! Anyone agree? The manager ones are worse than the regular ones...especially when they're 3 times too big! BLECK!  I'm done.  *~Kayla~*
