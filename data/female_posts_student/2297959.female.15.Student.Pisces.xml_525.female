OH, jon foreman's hair, that was absolutely amazing. i loved it. i loved all of them. i always do. and i liked that drew was with them. my brother was a total idiot, he thoought itwould be hilarious to film me and co. while we were sleeping and then wake us up. so i kicked him in the stomach. i don't really like my brother at all because he still thinks he's emo. and i still love my hair. i hope betsy's haircut turned out all right. my mom said she would take me out (illegally) driving. i want to drive but she hasnt taken me to get my permit yet. ah whateva
