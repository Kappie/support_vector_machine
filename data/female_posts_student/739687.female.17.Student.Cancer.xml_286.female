So I spent $15 so some guy could go buy us some alcohol. And, of course, because of the fact that God hates me, plans fell through. So I told Bo he owes me a bottle of vodka. Seeing as how other people are drinking MY alcohol tonight.  Urghh. Oh well. Now I get vodka instead of nasty beer and bitch drinks. So I guess in a way I win. Kinda.  Well, kiddies, I don't have much else to say tonight. Oh by the way, today was the longest day of the year. I hope you enjoyed it...err, I suppose *yesterday* rather.  Party like crazy, crazies.
