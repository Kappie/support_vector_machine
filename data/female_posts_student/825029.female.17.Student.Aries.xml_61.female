THERE WILL BE SO MUCH  PIE!!!   well whatever.  so yay.  i guess i dont have much to say.  something that rhymes with yay and say like day pay may nay gay hay gray ok.!!!  ummmmm.  im contemplating whether complete insensitivity to all things in the world would be best.  it would greatly reduce stress, and it seems like people like to hate me an awful lot (not you friends) but random people whom i havent met dislike me and i cant figure it out.  theres nothing i can do to please them.  so maybe if i laugh about it a lot and not care.  good idea.  ok case closed. :E  well im done so ill be going.  probably wont be another update before i leave so yeah. talk to you later all. yours.
