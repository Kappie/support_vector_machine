That was cool.  I don't know what I'm going to do this week... it looks pretty open so if anyone has any ideas let me know.  Well I guess that's it...   maybe i could tell some more fun camp stories.  We did some fun stuff at the talent show... like this weird cup game/skit thing and bethanne fell off her chair and it was funny... yeah well anyway I guess that's all.
