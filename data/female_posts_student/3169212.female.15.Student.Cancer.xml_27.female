She's going to be completely blind, but she can see a color that represents Kurama.          Kinda like Ivy Walker and Joaquin Phoenix's character who's name escapes me as of yet.          I'm also thinking that she enters these woods that are full of demons.          I hope M. Night Shyamalan won't be upset that I'm kinda taking his idea.          If M. Night Shyamalan is reading this then I sincerely apologize and I think your name is really kick ass.          I'm just going to say it for kicks; M. Night Shyamalan.
