I really wish people would give me a chance to breathe before they start the same old cycles of bullshit that they keep pulling me into.Or that they would decide to keep their stupid mouths shut when they really have nothing to say or have no idea what the real situation is. One piece of good news, my husband is going to be making more money and spending more time at home. That makes me very happy. Be back soon, making dinner and writing in my blog are not going hand in hand as well as I had hoped.
