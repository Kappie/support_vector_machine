I was actually kinda nervous cuz we haven't sung our MPA songs for anyone except the compser and some music teachers from the highschools lol. But it went well..i hope we were good. But anyway....nothing really has been goin on...i really wanna hang out at bills lol...he's the only one without parents so we hang out there. Its really fun but not when EVERYONE is there lol. It beats staying home over the weekend lol. I really wanna see...u know who for somereason....hehe. not gonna tell.  haha i don't know what ryan had in his mouth in mathclass but he stuck out his toung and it fell out! hahahahaha omg it was just so funny. And i got to arm restle with Thomas lol. I lost...of course. But thats not the point lol. Today was fun.
