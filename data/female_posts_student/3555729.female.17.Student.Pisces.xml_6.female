It's our time to shine through the down Glorified by what is ours We've fallen in love It was the best idea I ever had  Today I fell and felt better Just knowing this matters I just feel stronger and sharper Found a box of sharp objects what a beautiful thing  Do you want a song of glory Well I'm fucking screaming at you
