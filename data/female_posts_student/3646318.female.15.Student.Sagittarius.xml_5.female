Yeah, it worries me that Bianca is pretty much to Steven what Chris Pelkey was to me. My first love was Chris, and Steven’s was Bianca, only thing was Chris and I never took our relationship to a sexual place…while Steven and Bianca did. And yeah, that does bug the SHIT outta me to be honest but I cant be mad him ( well, at least with it making sense) for his past because I understand at the time he loved her ( ouch, that really hurts me...but oh well). *sigh* Okay, anyways this bit…um I mean girl is calling Steven everyday, and I’m like “what the fuck bitch, you know” but um, it’s not like I can help it or it’s not like it doesn’t make sense. I have a hella good reason. I would be mad if ANY girl called Steven everyday, and I guess it sorta adds to the anger when it’s his ex….not to mention his ex-love. The only other girl he fucked without a condom except me…so yeah I’m pissed.  And I’m not stupid no girl calls a guy everyday if they don’t like him and today…Steven found out it bugs me…what he doesn’t know is it pisses me off greatly and honestly if  knew the bit…um girl…it wouldn’t be pretty.  I…no, I hate anyone trying to take my guy...fuck that…I hate it when girls tried to take away my ex-boyfriends and I didn’t give a shit about those guys…so imagine Steven. Some chick trying to take my love who I’ve been in a relationship with for 9 months, trust him with my life, heart, body, I gave him my virginity, and who I know I wanna marry? Aw Hell Naw, fuck that shit up the ass. And Well…Of course Bianca called today and said some shit like “I have feelings for you” ( I say…”like duh!) and well Steven told me he told her they couldn’t talk anymore….( I don’t know if it’s true...but I cant do anything about it ‘cept trust him…so I guess that’s what I gotta do).  Well, whatever…I’m just saying…This shit pisses me off…and ooooh, god, if I knew what her last name was……it’d be sweet, but I gotta chill down, you know? I cant go…pulling favors for some dumb shit and some dumb reason…so I aint about at pull some shit over it. According to Steven, he don’t have feelings for her…I sense bull….because once you love someone…you cant forget. I loved Chris Pelkey, and damn, I know I still do, but I learned a long time ago…that…it’d never work out. So I don’t know I guess I’ll have to trust Steven…and the rest….welll….whatever. All I’m saying…is…this shit aint cool..so yeah.. .. I’m not cool with it at all..I think it’s some stupid bitch ass hoe shit *sigh* but then again I’m just pissed. I got a short temper, I think I’m bout to be on  my rag, and on top of that all….I’m Puerto Rican…so..yeah…aint a good time for this. Whatever….this shit is dumb.
