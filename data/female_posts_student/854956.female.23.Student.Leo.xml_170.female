Yeah... it happened.  That's reason numero uno.  The next (and most recent) reason is this:  I found out that Steve is single and looking... specifically for a very musical girl.  That I am... this pleases me greatly!  Could there be a possibility here?  I dunno... I'm going to give it a shot and see if he wants to go out sometime... if he says no, that's okay too... I'm still just in crush mode... so it won't hurt that badly... but I should probably do so soon before I start feeling more... I wouldn't wanna get shot down then.  That'd suck!
