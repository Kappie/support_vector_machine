I went to see Harry Potter III Friday. It was pretty good. I saw my Latin teacher! Very exciting! He. I saw the preview for Hilary Duff's new movie. I used extreme self-control to refrain from running out and slitting my wrists.   I'll be so glad when school's out so I can get an orthadontist appointment finally. I need one badly.   I talked to Shelby for the first time in a really long time. It was crazy. I can't remember the last time I talked to Amanda. The only friends I have...I don't know what to say about it...but...it's like...they didn't go to school with me but they were still always there. But it's not like that anymore. I should have known we wouldn't be able to keep that up this long. It's been too long. We'll see what summer holds. Though I bet they both have big plans and are going to be doing something with someone almost everyday. My summer's are like my weekends. I sit around with nothing to do, listening to the same CDs, jumping at the opportunity to go anywhere with anybody in my house(to the dump, the grocery store, wherever). That's it.  I'm trying to think of things I can do this summer to keep me occupied. Next summer will be different. I'll have my license by then. Too bad I can get it at the end of this summer. Lousy timing. Anyways...things to do..things to do this summer...    Type up lyrics. Yay. That can only last so long. I only have so many CDs  Start with the first CD on my collection and listen to each until the last.   Read. This isn't working out too good for me. One of those books I bought from my list already isn't that great. And so I started another one because I'm book-snobbish and can't be bothered with books less than anything I expected or want. The one I started is alright...I actually am willing myself to finish it though I don't really want to.   Clean my room. This'll take what? Not even a day.  Watch movies  I could study Latin...I haven't really learned much...I just always memorized grammar rules for quizzes and tests...I didn't learn. Actually this is just something I  should  do. I'm definetly not going to.  Draw...that sounds so lame but it does keep me occupied as long as I'm inspired. School is usually my inspiration though - school related things like peers and stress and stuff...   School really is my life, I'm sad to admit. I think for most teens it is. But for most teens they have lives outside of school. That is where I am at a fault. That's okay though. I guess. It just gets so boring and lonesome sometimes. I don't like to admit being lonely but it does. Sometimes I do get lonely.     Music: Angelfuck - The Misfits
