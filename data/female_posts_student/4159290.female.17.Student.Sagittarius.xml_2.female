But, I'll get to that in a minute.  This weekend has been pretty fun... and I still have Sunday to go.  Daddy took Friday off, and he and I went to Freeport for the day.  It was really weird, cuz it was like an inside out mall.  Like, there was a bath and body works, wilsons leather, abercrombie, banana republic, gap, and a bunch of stores like that, but they were all separate buildings.  And they had a bunch of local touristy shops and restaurants too.  It was pretty neat tho.  I got a really cute hot pink monogram leather purse, a stuffed animal lobster, a toy 1950s pink corvette convertible, and these nifty little 50s/60s vintagey pictures with a bunch of cynical captions.  They were actually postcards, but I'm gonna use them to decorate.  And Daddy got me these cute blue, rhinestony flip-flop shaped earrings.  We got ice cream from Diary Queen on the way there..  Oh!  I still have half my blizzard in the freezer!  *runs to freezer and returns 10 minutes later...*  Ok, *sigh* that's better.  Anyways, we got ice cream, and picked up some lobster and clam chowder to eat when we got home.  And I was really tired..  I went to bed at 11, and fell asleep within 30 minutes..  But that was prolly cuz I was up till 4:30 the night before.  Anyways, then today I slept till about 11.  Daddy was getting after me for sleeping so much.. then a bit later, I followed him upstairs, and laid down on the bed while he was rummaging through stuff or something, then he finished, and laid down beside me, and he was asleep in like 5 minutes, lol.  I went and ate breakfast/lunch and then went and jumped on the bed and scared the crap outta him.  Then we both just spent about 20 minutes pestering and tickling each other...  it was fun.  Then after we got up and going, Daddy, Cindy, and I went kayaking on the river behind the house.  We had been going about 30 minutes, and Daddy said, I bet I can stand up in this thing... and Cindy and I were like, what!? are you crazy?  So he tried, and he got halfway up, then it wobbled and he sit back down... and I was like wow, I wanna try!  So I passed my stuff to Daddy to hold, and tried.  It's pretty hard to do.  I got half way up two different times, then had to sit back down cuz I wasn't balanced.  Then the third time I got close to all the way up, and I fell in...  It was cool tho, cuz the water felt really good.. even tho it was pretty cold.  Then Daddy was amazed that I crawled back into the kayak from the water without flipping.  Ahh.. I'm just that good..  hehe, anyways..  when I got back in, I tried a few more times, and I got up a little more each time.. then I finally stood all the way up.  I did that like four or five separate times.. and one time that Cindy was videoing, I was standing completely straight up for over two minutes.  Daddy was absolutely amazed..  He didn't believe that my balancing skills were as good as I said they were.  And of course, he had to try again.. and he did finally get all the way up, but only for about 15-20 seconds.  And if you think this story is not that amazing...  then you're dumb.  It's very hard to do (except for me.)  Try it sometime, you'll see.  Oh, and we tooks some pics and videos..  I'll post a link when I get my site..  we tried to get it tonight, but I was having issues getting it to accept Daddy's credit card.
