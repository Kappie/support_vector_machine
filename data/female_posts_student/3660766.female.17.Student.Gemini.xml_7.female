Him even being around once a year would be so great to me, but he doesnt even care about me enough to do that. Then i think about all the bad shit he has done to my mom and then i dont want him around. I just dont think people realize how hard it is to grow up without a dad and not even knowing where he is at. i remember when i was younger and people would ask me questions about my dad or my family on that side in general and i felt like the biggest idiot bc i had no clue. which all led to many nights of crying myself to sleep, which still go on today... lol yah i know, im 17 and still cry bc my dad isnt here. So i promised myself that i would never have kids if i wasnt sure that my children wouldnt have a happy family and a stable one at that.
