It was horrible until Charlotte and Nick came over. We didn't do anything but it was fun. We watched the Jetsons movie.   We made a 20 second movie. Here's how the script reads: ~It's hard to make out.. it's in boy scribble... Nick was producer, writer, and director. He wrote the 'script' on a picture I drew of Mr. Bean. (it's not who you think; He's a lima bean with a cane and jaunty top hat.) HA HA HA. He's most excellent. Outgalactical. Orbital. (Yes the Jetsons kick ass.) Anyway... *Charlotte: Hi guys! How's it goin'? (Natalie and Nick enter). Natalie: It's great yo! I just got back from a spank party. Nick: Yeah, it was.... (NA  NI look at eachother and say simultaneously...) "RADICAL!" Nick: But we came back for you! Natalie: Yeah we totally love you dawg... yo. Charlotte: Woot, I love you guys too! I don't feel left out anymore! Let's go make food! -Fin- THERE!* (it actually says those last things). See Charlotte was pissed because she felt left out cause it was me and Nick that supposedly go to the party....the last part was added later. hahaha. I'm gonna stick this on my clipboard. Its just too great. Cause Mr Bean just looks so incredibly jaunty.   GAA I'm soooo excited about the Jason Mraz concert. Me and Charlotte decided we have to get back stage somehow. He's just too excellent. BUY the cd, it's sooo good. And he's the most amazing singer I've heard for a looong time.  I bought a cookie monster hat. It's sooo cute! I'm such a dork. Josh got a gay boy necklace. Excellent. ..I say that too much. Top 10 most influential movies of my life, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Heh... jk. But it is most egregious. ("Ted... we are about to flunk most egregiously." ~ "It's your MOM, dude." ~ "You killed Ted you medieval dickweed!" ~ "Dude, those are historical babes." ~ Or my favorite: "Heinous. Bogus. Most non-triumphant. Don't be dead, dude!" Hahaha... sorry... I'm just rambling now. It's 1:09 am.  * I would.. if I could.... I would do most anything... spontaneously... you know I would * -Jason Mraz  BE EXCELLENT TO EACHOTHER. AND PARTY ON, DUDES!
