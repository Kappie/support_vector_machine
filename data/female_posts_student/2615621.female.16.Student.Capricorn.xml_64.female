I'm not going yo hondorus. dammit, i dont gete to drink and party with a bunch of spanish speaking people who have no idea what the word "awesome" is. dammit. hahaha that was random, anyways, im going to go stay with my dad. staying with my dad has its pros and cons, which are listed below for your reading pleasure.   PRO: SWIMMING POOL IN THE BACKYARD TO MY SELF CON: If i get really sunburned, then i get sick haha PRO: WORKIN ON THA TAN CON: skin cancer PRO: MY DADDY TAKING ME SHOPPING :D CON: gaining 10lbs, or losing 10lbs and not being able to wear it all haha PRO: GOING ON AN ANNUAL SUMMER DIET AND THEN COMING BACK TO SEE MY FRIENDS CON: having to wait over a month to see my friends or lose some pounds! haha PRO: JUST BEING WITH MY DAD FOR MORE THAN 24HRS LITERALLY CON: having to see all the things that used to be in my house growing up, bring back memories. it took me a while to get over that, like 5yrs lol long ass story.  PRO:GETTING TO DO COOL NEW EXCITING STUFF, LIKE CONCERTS HOPEFULLY! CON: ummm...i dont know....haha getting raped? naw..hahah PRO: GETTING TO SEE FAMILY I HAVENT SEEN SINCE I WAS 7 CON: being forced on them, i know they dont want anything to do with me, but it means a lot of my dad for them to "accept" me..fuck them all. they havent talked to me since i was 7, im now 16. PRO: MY AUNTS ARE LOADED WITH BOATS AND LAKES AND STUFF... CON: who gives a fuck. i dont wanna be on their shit. hahah  now...the biggest CON of all time? not being able to see lauren before she goes off to school as much as i wanted to. I wanted to spend ALL the time i could, because i hate to say it though, shes my only real friend at our school...which sucks. i could live a good 2 months without katie and everyone else, i could talk to them through emails and be fine with only seeing them 3 times a year, but lauren, gosh, i tell her like everything (yeah u) haha and i just like being around her. dammit, it sounds like im in love with her haha naw, shes just a really awesome friend. which reminds me...  Allie moore, amy deborde, and amanda bruner, and clarise strange are like lesbos. HAHA allie made out with amy at jalisa's house like all weekend and then went and got a hotel room with clarise and then i heard amanda was in on with with allie sometime. who did i hear it from? a very VERY disgusted amdanda williams at the good ol' mayberry mall. hahaha i believe her, she was like seriously distrubed. LMAO and i saw allie and amy at lunch...the look on their faces when their eyes met...awww..LMAO  Theres so much to complain about and to say but u know...im not in the mood! haha im happy  CHRIS C. IS SO FREAKIN HOT! and to think that when i put together all the body parts of his ive seen, ive seen him totally naked!! haha how funny is that? very.   I want a guy...bad....lol and to think theres not any hot guys that live around my dads...that i know of...hmmm im getting ideas.   ANOTHER PRO: i'll have the computer ALL day to myself from 7am-6pm! haha yay so i can talk to all my friends who arent doing anything at all! haha see lauren, it wont be so bad.   VOTE JULIA STUDENT BODY TREASURER!   *much love*
