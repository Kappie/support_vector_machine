In order to complete some activities I have planned for a    P O  E  T  R  Y   E  X  T R A  V A G  A  N  Z       A    next week, I need you to have some materials ready.  Your assignment is this:  Each student in the class needs to find each of the following items.  The goal is to find the objects which will be used in class (so you shouldn’t need to have them in the same form to take back home), and not spend any money on them.  Look around the garbage can for the junk mail or a "stash-it-all" drawer for the postcards or letters, for example.  Items due in class on Monday and I will give you credit for all of your hard work.  Good luck and happy hunting!    Item list   One permanent ink marker (preferably some dark color) One t-shirt (white or light color) that fits you An old post-card (blank) An old post-card with message A very, very, very sharpened pencil At least four used postage stamps (at least 1” x 1”--the larger the better)—on the envelopes or off Ten pieces of junk mail An old magazine (school appropriate :) Some sort of blank book A piece of wood (no larger than 1’ x 1’ x 1”) An old calendar page (any month--bring extras if you find them) An old letter A map (can be local, national, world, etc.) A family recipe A shoebox to hold all of it (unless your piece of wood is too big--try to make it fit!)    Point #2 You should begin e-mailing me your drafts that you are beginning to finish.  Mail to:   urlLink lhager@mercer.k12.ky.us
