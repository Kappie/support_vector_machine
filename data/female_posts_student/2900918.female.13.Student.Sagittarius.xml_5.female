Mayb tat's becoz you're not observant enuff  im quite frustrated with the government.. cuz we don have enuff liberation.. i don realli need liberation to the extent tat America has, but even Taiwan has more liberation than us.   Altho im not a jap freak [ lyk jas ], but they have jus the right amount of liberation. If you see b4 the smap concert commercial. you probabli understand wad im trying to mean...
