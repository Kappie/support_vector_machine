It wasn't open so Katharine pressed what she thought was the doorbell. The garage door went down. Oops! Better press it again. Garage door stops. Again? Garage door continues going down...Grumpy Japanese answers the door,"oh no. What choo do? Take off shoes. Come in." now I couldn't hear this due to the fact that she was in the living room and I was in the kitchen, but I think oba said something along the lines of, "oh you take long time to get here. im fucking hungry!" (the casual use of profanity wasn't such a big surprise since last Christmas break, Katharine was proclaimed a "chicken shit" for talking during Oprah.) so then we began our sushi making. katn washed the raw rice,and I scraped  the cooked stuff into a large wooden basin. Oba informed me that I was to fan the rice with my left hand and stir in the flavoring and rice vinegar with my right;I was absolutely not to "squash rice" with my "crumsy hand." then we spread the rice on seaweed paper and put in our vegetables. I rolled the sushi on a bamboo mat with great skill. Beautiful sushi! mmm. Katharine lovingly caressed each one after we plopped it on the plate and told them how pretty they were. After we had finished making the Japanese cuisine, Katharine announced that she had an abhorrence toward seaweed and would rather indulge in a piece of watermelon that she had spied in the fridge along with a 7up.  oba: no,you spoil you dinner Katharine: I will not! Its healthy its fruit! oba:that's problem with you mother generation. Fruit desert. Let kids eat too much junk. katn: what?! Its FRUIT! Its healthy!  after lunch Katharine snored on the sofa while oba and I watched a Japanese soap opera about this kid who was forced to work at the age of seven and ran away and wound up freezing to death in the snow and was rescued by an AWOL soldier and an old man both wearing fur coats and then they taught the little girl how to read anti war poems and then her mother found out from the employment office that poor little Oshin was missing....and thats as far as I got. very cheesey. very hilarious. i brought 3 tapes home. i'm such a loser.
