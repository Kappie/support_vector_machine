I was so messed up from the goodness of today that I thought it was Tuesday and I went to my guitar lesson...very surprised to see my teacher ask me why I had come so early..."24 hours early, dude" he said. So amidst a row of supressed chuckles I grinned and walked out.  And I set up ALL MY TOYS. Yay! But one of the very expensive condensers decided that it didn't want it to work right anymore...so I have to send it back. Also...lots of sounds that didn't get through...like the drums themselves...and lots of other sounds that did...the air conditioner...the computer...the motor on the recorder...the freakin'  hum of the lights in my room ...any passing cars...my breathing...walking...bad placement of the stands...the dogs...these are the best and thus, the worst mics I've ever had. Tomorrow, I'm going to have a session, and I have a good feeling that the whole thing will be us setting up and trying to make things not gay and sound good.  I deleted the first cut of  Broken Me  for this thing. These are the final demos so everybody gets a copy reallllll soon...actually, probly the first day of school or something like that. We're a really dumb band but we're not that bad.
