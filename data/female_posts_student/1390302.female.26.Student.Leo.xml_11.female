The Internet is a beautiful creature that infests itself in our homes and grows on us to the point that we can hardly live with out it.  The Internet is a brilliant near life form, a near life form that allows us to talk to people across the country, across the world, or just next door with relative ease.  The Internet allows women to meet their dream man from half way across the country, from the comfort of their own living rooms. Something so innovative and for God sake, damn brilliant couldn’t have come from Al Gore –Its just not possible!  While we’re on the topic of Al Gore, I have a few things to say. How is it that in America a brilliant man who can run a country and a war but can’t spell Potato (If you haven’t caught on I’m talking about Dan Quale) can be criticized and made into a the bud of a million and one political –and otherwise- jokes. Then an ignorant prick like Al Gore could nearly win the presidency.  It must be some democratic conspiracy to completely screw up America.  Could you imagine Al Gore trying to conduct this War: “Give up Sadam, you have another 8 years to do disarm.  Take you time, and you better do it or I’ll say do it again!” or maybe: “There are more important issues. Now, you -send that crate of arms to the middle east, you- send that crate of weapons to Korea, you -round up all the cuban kids and send them home at gun point, and you –get me a prostitute.”  Hmmm… I think this is what’s called a tangent, sorry.  I think I got a bit off the topic…  … Internet, is it just me or is they’re more and more people meeting their spouses on the Internet.  My sister and her husband met online –I’m not saying that a good thing, especially since he’s such a huge prick- but they met there none the less.  I met my husband online and we couldn’t be happier.  Our friend Chris met a really cool girl through the Internet –granted it was a mixed up, round about way- and they ended up married.  Even my fourteen-year-old sister has two guy friends online.  It seems to me that Internet predators are getting more and more rare.  Now I’m not saying that they don’t exist and I am also not saying that don’t feel for those people who have been struck with the tragedy of Internet predators.  I’m just saying that people are getting more and more careful now a days.     Internet allows me to stay in touch with a friend who moved away in the 10th grade.  It also allow’s me to stay in touch with my family 1,500 miles away.  So who really invented the Internet?  ~Kristyn
