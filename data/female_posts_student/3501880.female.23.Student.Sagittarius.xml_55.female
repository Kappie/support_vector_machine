Which is sort of why I hope that a "schedule conflict" will release me from the obligation of editing this law review article.  I was lured by the money at first, but after the first day of editing, and the reality of the project set in, I realized that my need to lounge around far outweighs having the green stuff waved in my face. After I sent in my edits for last night, my boss emailed me and said that he would like to have the whole first edit (the article is 201 pages long) done by early next week. Considering it takes me about 2.5 hrs to edit 12 pages, I don't think that is going to happen. And I don't want it to happen. A lot more of the green stuff is going to have to be waved in my face for me to put in that amount of effort. At least double what he is paying me now! I just wrote him an e-mail and informed him of how much I am willing to work, and that his deadlines conflict with my work schedule. Now, I am sitting back and crossing my fingers that he will "no longer be in need of my services".
