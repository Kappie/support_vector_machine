It's like, 1pm on Sunday already, and I haven't done anything, and probably won't do anything, so I decided I could post about my weekend now.  : )  Friday, I didn't do much of anything, really.  I went to class, then came home, ate some lunch, and then went on a LONG walk with my Mom.  Lasted about 1hr 15mins.  It was a good walk, and the last 15 minutes I jogged off an on, and came home feeling very energized.  Then I ate dinner with my parents, and we watched some tv, and then I went to bed (sorta early, actually).    Saturday was a pretty fun day (but slow starting to get to the fun part).  I had been bumming around the house all day, not doing much of anything.  Then WHAM-BAM I got a call from Jennifer!  YAY!  Calls from other countries are cool, and they make you feel very special.  We were just talking about anything and everything for about 40 minutes.  : )  It was good to hear from her... I had missed her a lot.  Then I watched tv a bit, and then I took a nap... then I got a call, and I couldn't fall back asleep, so I just got up.  I decided to take a shower, since I hadn't felt like it earlier that day.  Then as I was watching a movie on Oxygen,  Where The Heart Is  with Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd, Ricky called.  The movie was okay... all centered a lot around Wal-Mart, which was somewhat interesting.  Anyhow, when Ricky called me we were talking for a bit, and he was saying he was going to go to HEB or KMart for his Mom.  So, I went along with him (to HEB) and we had like, 3 or 4 things we had to get.  While we were there, we ran into Mrs. Etheredge from Roosevelt.  She was asking us how things were going with school and the like, and then she asked about Marta.  It was good seeing her, I guess.  Anyhow, so we went on to Ricky's, and his Mom made dinner, and we had some GOOD spaghetti!  YUM!  After we ate, Mike kept saying he wanted to watch Mr. Deeds.  Ricky didn't really wanna see it, and I didn't care... I had heard it was bad, but hadn't seen it so I was fine with watching it.  Wolf came over (he was in town as well).  So, we were watching Mr. Deeds and Druck finally called back, so we told him to come on over.  The movie was okay... but DEFINITELY not like the other Adam Sandler movies!  : (  I'd say that The Wedding Singer is my favorite Sandler movie.  "They were cooones!"  :-)  hehehe  We finished the movie, and then we watched Batman Beyond for an hour, and then we watched Southpark.  Then all of us were pretty tired, so we went on home.  I GOT MY CAKEPAN BACK!!!  : D  WOOHOO!      Tomorrow    Tomorrow I go to the Rodeo with my parents and uncle.  Ray Charles and Neal McCoy are the entertainment.  I think it'll be an experience.  I've never been to the SBC Center, and we're going to have those close box seats again.  Like always.  I actually think that we're going to be going to the Rodeo a second time this year!  My Dad's friend from work, Mr. Larned wanted to go, but he didn't want to go alone.  I've known him forever (since I was little)... and he's gone through a lot the past 2 years.  His wife just passed away at the end of the summer from a year long battle with cancer.  I was somewhat close to her, too.  She used to tell me stuff about teaching and such, and we had some good conversations.  I miss her, and it's sad to me that she's not around anymore.  And her death was pretty sudden.  I mean, she was diagnosed with cancer and told she'd have 6 months- 1 year.  And she passed just short of a year of being diagnosed.  There was nothing that could be done for her.  Anyhow, so we may go to the Rodeo with Mr. Larned sometime.  We'll see.      Frog Name   It's been decided that the frog tattoo on my right ankle will be named Dax.  Everyone seems pretty happy with that, so I dub thou "Dax the frog."  Okay, that's all for now... I'll post something after the Rodeo to either rant or rave about the SBC Center.  : )       urlLink  postCount('2Feb2003');
