I felt the same way but decided to leave it out of my blog because I am trying to keep the same tone throughout, trying to focus on any redeeming qualities the movie may have had, and in this movies sake, spend the other 90% of the blog on the negative aspects. One of those negative aspects was the stabbing of the pregnant woman's stomach. I am not a squemish person, but i found myself looking away from the screen in disgust. I just feel that is an image that has no place in cinema.  Now if i worked for a newspaper i would have to title my review of this movie "The longest yard". The 2000 hit-man comedy,   The Whole Nine Yards  , was no masterpiece but it was a clever, enjoyable slapstick that provided a good recipe with Bruce Willis as a contract killer, Mathew Perry as his long suffering neighbor and Amanda Peet as a homicidally ambitious dental assistant.  For the sequel,   The Whole Ten Yards  , Warner Bros. has reassembled the same cast with a different director(Howard Duetch filling in for Jonathan Lynn) and come up with an excruciating sequel that has virtually none of the wit and charm of the original. The first thing the movie does wrong is jump right into its complex set of characters and relationships with no subtle recap of what we saw four years ago. So if you haven't seen the DVD lately, you're in for a 99 miniute struggle to find out whats going on. It also became painfully evident that the original was complete unto itself and the writers have had to strain themselves to come up with a this awful premise in which the stars find themselves threatened by the gangster father of some obscure character from the first movie.  The single bright spot of the proceedings is Peet, whose aspiring hit-woman set the tone of the original and sparked its best scenes. Once again, she nails the character but everything around her is so dismal that it overshadows another good performance by Peet.  Now from the best to the worst, Willis is kept on a sporadic diet of terrible jokes about Jimmy's "erectile dysfunction." He squints and strains through the role, as though he'd taken a laxative to produce comedy. (It doesn't work.) He and Perry have no chemistry; they don't work together for laughs; they get out of each other's way. Their lack of teamwork makes you long for Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin in  Midnight Run   , a far superior comedy about a hit-man and an uptight white-collar guy.
