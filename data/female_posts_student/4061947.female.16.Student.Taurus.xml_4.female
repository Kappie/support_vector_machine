The car is usually on the left side, which allows plenty of room to back up and turn around.  My parents lost the garage door openers, so the car is on the right side.  Of course I chose this day to be not observant.  I get in the car, buckle up, and start to back up.  I look behind me, since I am such a good driver.  I notice that I am starting to go off of the driveway and into the ravine.  I figure if I slam on the brakes, it wouldn't be good for the car.  So, I ease onto the brake when I hear a THUD and the car instantly stops moving.  I take a close look from the driver's seat and notice that I have backed my parents SUV directly into a tree.  How convenient.  I pull forward and get out to see how much damage is done.  There is a lovely dent in the back of it.  I go to tell my parents what I have done.  It is at this moment that I discover my neck and back hurt.  Anyway, my parents find it rather humorous and I am not in any trouble.  I just have to pay for it to be fixed.  (I just got done paying off the $793.55 worth of damage my friends did to the car trying to get my keys out of the same vehicle).  My dad says that he will try to get the dent out, but I'm not going to have my hopes up.  I will let you know how it goes.
