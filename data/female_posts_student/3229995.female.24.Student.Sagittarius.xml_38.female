But Brooklyn most definitely has his dad's looks and charm, whilst Romeo is very similar to Victoria.  Rumour: trying for a little girl, have at least admitted they want more kids but personally I think that until they are both a little more relaxed about their careers it will be hard to give any more children the time they deserve with both parents.
