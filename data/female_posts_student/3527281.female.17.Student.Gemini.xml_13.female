As you have probably noticed, I love making up random titles to my posts. It's just fun and I'm hoping that it'll catch someone's attention like, "What in the world is she talking about?!" Even if someone thinks I'm crazy, I still want people to read this!! =)  Okay before I go into the events of the past two days, I need to get something off my chest and ask for some advice. It's about one of my friends. I won't say who, just in case she reads this, but at this point, I almost don't care. Well this friend of mine, we've been friends for some time now. Probably since 8th grade and we became really good friends in high school. This year however, towards the end of the year, she really started to irk me. She started to irk me like NO ONE else I know. I've felt like she's in constant competition with me about every stinking thing. If I like a guy, she likes the same guy. If I say something, she has to contradict me. If I complain about something, she has to say something like, "Oh you don't know the half of it. In my case...blah blah." If I say something I found out, like exciting news and I'd tell her she'd say, "I know!!!" Or if I'd say something about myself or family, like one time I was talking about when my dad's birthday was, she says, "No one cares!" She has just changed a lot. And it has really started to annoy me. But I'd still talk to her and invite her to stuff and try to do stuff with her, even when I wanted to scream. I put up with her. And here, I find out she told one of our friends that she is sick of some of her friends because some of them are "so immature." And guess who one of those friends is?? Yeah, me. Supposively, I am immature. What really ticks me off is how she can even say that!!! I mean she really needs to look at her OWN behavior: she is really loud everywhere (including places, like restaurants, where you should be quiet)...Ugh, I don't want to go pointing out all her behavior, but I just don't get it. How can she say something like that about me when I've always been her friend? I just do not get it!!!  *phew* Well I feel somewhat better. I would still like to throw my fist through a wall or something right now. Just thinking about it makes me fume. Blah...putting it out of mind...  Okay.  So yesterday LeeAnne and I decided we were going to go to the new movie place in Mansfield and see Troy since I can see rated-R movies now. So we get there, and we see it's not playing. So we're ticked because we really wanted to see it, I mean Orlando Bloom is in it! *sigh* So we went to see if it was playing at the movie place by Kohl's, and it wasn't. So we went into Kohl's anyway because we like that store. And we both ended up buying $3 picture frames, which are really cute. Then we decided we were gonna go back to the new movie place and see Shrek 2 instead. So we go back and we're paying for our tickets and we see that Troy IS playing...the sign for it was down, away from the other signs, but it wasn't playing until 9:55. So we decided it was too late anyway. Neither one of us have eaten lunch, so we decide we want to get popcorn for the movie. So LeeAnne goes and asks for a small drink first and the guy behind the counter is like, "Just wait a second, there. If you order a medium for only a quarter, yes, a quarter more you get 8 more ounces." So she's like, "Ummm..okay. You talked me into it." So then she's ordering the popcorn that we're going to split and she asks for a medium and he says, "Now, now. If you order a large for only 75 cents more you get this much more (showing the comparison of the bags) AND you get free refills if you want them. *smile*" And LeeAnne's like "Free refills?! Who is going to come out in the middle of a movie to get a free refill?" lol It was quite funny. Shrek 2 was really good, btw. I thought it was better than the first one.  So after that we went to Best Buy to see if Dan Kubasek was working. But he wasn't. So then we went to TGIFriday's for dinner. It was good. Then we went to Michael's to look at crafts because we're craft people. We ended up buying buttons and some elastic (which we used later to make these really cool bracelets). Then we went to B to look and see if we could find any interesting books. There were some *ahem* interesting ones. We're like "Oh...my. eww.." lol It was funny. Then we thought we were going to get some ice cream from Chocolatiers (i think that's what it's called), but it was closed. So we stopped at Gabriel Brothers to see if the had any cheap furniture that we could decoupage, but they didn't. So we went to Wal-Mart and bought a clear plate to decoupage. Then we went back to my house. And we both realized that in that one day, those 5 or 6 hours, we had spent thirty-five bucks each!! We were like "WHA-?!" But it was still fun...  Then when she left, around 11:30-ish. My dad was like "Jacqui, can you come over here, your mother and I need to talk to you about something." So I'm thinking, "Great...some lecture on my messy room or something." And I sit down on the couch next to my dad and he hands me this sheet of paper. So I look at it....         Hmm. It's a print-out from the internet.  Why is there a car on this print-out?  Hey....wait a second....  My parents, it turns out, have been looking at cars for a while. And they found this one. So today after I worked, we went and I bought it!!!! I was so excited!! I used money from my savings and now I will make payments to my savings each month. It is: a white 1996 Honda Accord. It's a really cool car. Usually I don't like white cars, but since it's mine, it's sweet. The only catch: it's stick shift. So that was an adventure today trying to learn to drive that. I'm so glad my dad is patient because if not, well it would've been bad. We drove around the Outlet Mall parking lot for about a half hour or more. I stalled out a lot at stop signs, but I ended up driving home on 42. So it wasn't too bad. The hardest part is starting from a stop especiall if you're on a hill. And it's quite scary if your car starts to roll backwards when you're trying to let up the clutch and push on the gas to go forward. Some experience!!!  Well I promised you that  ghost story  so here it is, then I'm out!  My grandpa, my uncle, and two cousins were somewhere out in the wilderness in Virginia (I think) some where. They went there to go on a fishing trip. So they fished the first day and then they went to the place they were staying at, this old bed and breakfast place. They were so tired they just went to bed right away. They can hear doors opening and closing throughout the night and creaking, but it's an old house, and they think nothing of it. Then my grandpa "dreams" that he is lying in bed when this little girl with long, silky black hair comes and sits on the edge of his bed. And puts her head on his chest, like a grandchild would to her grandfather. So my grandpa goes to put his hand on her head, and she disappears. The next day they go fishing again and come back. And this time he goes to this hallway at this place and it has all these Alice in Wonderland stuff: books, figurines, etc. So my grandpa is fascinated by all these books and he's looking at him, but he didn't really pay attention to the figurines or anything. That night he goes to bed, and he has the same dream again: a little girl comes, sits on the edge of his bed, lies her head on his chest, he goes to put his hand on her head, and his hand goes through most of her head this time, and then she disappears. He still thinks nothing of it. So the next morning they're all eating breakfast with the owners of this place and the lady says, "I see you were interesting in my Alice in Wonderland collection?" And he says, "Yeah, the books were amazing." And she asks, "Well, did you touch any of the little statues or anything?" And he says, "No, I really didn't look at them." And she says, "Oh because one of them was moved...but it occasionally is moved into a certain cupboard in this place." And my grandpa says, "Ermm..no I didn't touch it." The figurine is of Alice looking in some mirror and seeing a ghost. And she says, "Well it's happened before." And her husband is like, "Don't tell him...." And my grandpa's like "Tell me what??" And the woman goes, "Well, this place is haunted." Of course my grandpa and unle were shocked and the woman goes on to say, "There was a family that lived her in the civil war times: a husband, wife, and their daughter. The husband was away fighting in the war. And while away, some stray bullets hit the house and the mother and daughter were killed....in the room where you are sleeping. I've seen the girl once in a while." And my grandpa says, "Does she have black hair??" And the woman says, "YOU'VE SEEN HER!!!" And he says, "Yeah, twice!!" So that night my uncle and grandpa decide they're not sleeping, they want to see this ghost. Thinking of them staying awake is quite humorous because they are notorious for falling asleep at family get togethers. So pretty soon my grandpa hears my uncle's snores and he thinks, "Aw..the the birds with this." So he gets up to go lock this door in their bathroom that connects to another room and he locks the door when all of a sudden.... it feels as if someone has put their hands on his back. And they start to gently push him and then they are pushing him to the point where he was pushed up on his toes and he had to put his arms out on the door so he wouldn't fall over. And when he turns around...   no one was there. The next day they left and my grandpa went upstairs two more times to see if he could see the girl again, but he didn't. My grandpa did say though that he never felt threatened or anything, he felt completely at ease and he believes the little girl could be an angel looking out for the house, hoping to someday see her father again.  Creepy, eh?
