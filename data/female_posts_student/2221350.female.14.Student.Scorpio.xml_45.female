I went bowling, I had fun, I got invited to a girl named alicia's house, so I went. Maybe I'm a pompous bastard who leads a semi-charmed life but.... I don't even know how to spit out what I'm trying to say! And this is my freaking blog and I'll probably never meet the people who read this but it's just hard so I guess I will shut up about it.  so all night long tiff and I sat around and watched movies while allie talked online with her 8 thousand internet boyfriends. I got up to see what they were talking about and these people((who are all waay older than her, she's 13)) seem to really care about her. Once again I'm a pompous bastard who shouldn't judge, but I don't know what they see in her. It's their businesses I suppose. Then she went off and yammered on the phone with one of these people((does she know how dangerous that is?)) and I hopped on to see what they were up to. Long winded piece of this story short, I made a new friend named nick and I got his screename and he's an internet geek like me. Then allie called nick and I said hello and she stayed on the phone with him until 4am. Ok so bla bla bla I got three hours sleep, we walked a couple blocks to tiffanys house and I seriously almost got runover!! We had this one huge intersection to cross and I was supposed to stay on the median but I kept running and I was so scared and people were honking and Jesus Christ I'm never crossing the street again. I finally made it home in one piece though and I'm glad.  the bowling part of the night was great and I like the holiday something alley in bossier better than the one here. We decided we need to go more often and get more people to come with us. Oh by the way, I am the worst bowler ever. My high score of the night was 48... Maybe I don't throw the ball right?  I just switched to some of ~The Clash~, I love them!  London calling to the underworld Come out of the cupboard,you boys and girls London calling, now don't look at us All that phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust!
