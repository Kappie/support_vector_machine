"yeah here's the general area, you can find the bathroom from here." unless they had the brail on the floor, which means that blind people would have to be barefoot, and be able to read brail with their toes. which would be the "granddaddy" talent of all talents. i hate you lindsay. lots and lots and lots.  today i did nothing. because i am far too lazy to be bothered to phone people and arrange arrangements and shiny potato-scented shit like that. buut. tomorrow i have drums :)! but i'm going to go. if i get reeeally bored i might blog later. doubtful, but possible. TEE HEE!  -joebie
