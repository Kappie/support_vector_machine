Physical Science or Chemistry? Debate or Advanced Speech? Aerobics or Health? Newspaper or Choir? Spainish or French? Will I cut it in Honors English.....what about in A.P. World Studies? Should I take zero hour? And where am I gonna fit in Bowling if I take it for my gym credit later? Where does those Tostido scoops get their shape? How does jello wiggle like that...?Is it really alive...? If listen to 'Tommy' with a candle burning will I really see my entire future? Why do they always take my Lucky charms? Why doesn't those kids the rabbit some Trix already? I bet he'd leave them alone.  Ok, so maybe those last few questions are irrelevant....  However, I do have some decisions to make.   I love choir(...Jenna and Andrea...what more entertainment do you need?...) but I'm not going to pursue anything musical and I can't go to Brazil so whats the point?   I also want to take zero hour so I won't have to deal with those crazy upper classmen and the pressure of trying to park with all them beeping their horns at me (which will most likely be the case)...  Plus, Debate will look really good on my college application, but what if I decide to do football cheer and it gets in the way?   Ugh.. I need my R.E.M. and milano cookies.  Then maybe I will be sane.
