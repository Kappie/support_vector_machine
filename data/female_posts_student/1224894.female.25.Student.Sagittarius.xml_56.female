Anyway, i'm just so happy today, not because i'm literally IN-LOVE, but, i just found some way to cope up with this bug in my heart, and somehow, help it discover true feelings and worth. Hmmm...love the song though..."I am a woman in love, and I'd do anything to get you into my world...and hold you within..."Enough of this madness, first and foremost, i would like to say thanks to the person/persons who created this BLOGGER net because this is so relaxing...:-) JCR, hey! I hope you have a safe trip to Seattle and good luck! Brum, thanks for the text earlier, i'm sorry i wasn't able to reply since, i was sooooooo busy.  For everyone's information...Brumhilda is my best friend who's now in UP-Los Banos...and i call her Brumhilda... You know what, i think i'd better sleep now, i could  hear some weird sounds from my window, and it's pretty scary...Till next time...Babushka!!!
