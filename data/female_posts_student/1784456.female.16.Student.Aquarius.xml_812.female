Have to get mum to teach me stuff. Sudden brain wave: What's new pussy cat? (You don't know that song?) Every one should! Ok, so when I said brain wave, I actually meant small ripple. :P Mmm... seeing as I'm bored I might go on typing my weirdo story! Yeay! Hey Izzy you gotta do Mr Fopple! First you have to get back from holiday... get back here!
