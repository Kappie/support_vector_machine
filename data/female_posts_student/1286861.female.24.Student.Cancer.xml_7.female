           
      I woke up late this morning�again. I got to work just in time for a party that I had planned. It was a good thing I put someone else in charge of brining the cake. After the party, I sat at my desk, starring blankly at the screen in front of me. I was there for about 45 minutes, starring�blankly. Evidently the �blank stare� is something not everyone can do well. I base this assumption on the fact that my training partner came up behind me and complimented me on my �blank stare�. She said, and I quote, �I wish I starred at my screen that well, you actually look like you could be working on something.�  I took this as a sign.  I contemplated my partner�s musings for pretty much the rest of the afternoon. Should I feel good�should I take it as a compliment? Maybe I should feel bad, guilty or something for not actually working while I was at work. I most likely shouldn�t even give it a second thought. Should I?   From the day I started my job (January 22, 2002), if I pieced all the moments of �blank stare� together, I would have approximately 3.4 days of total and complete, compacted, uninterrupted �blank stare�. And even a more disturbing thought�imagine what stupid things I must have been thinking about while lost in these �blank stare� fits. I am a self-diagnosed thinker-way-to-mucher (yes, I made that up), and I can only imagine the thoughts that may have once crossed my mind. Conjuring up that thought will give me nightmares for days, I just know it. Thinking about thoughts I conjure�I need help.  I want to work on this�this�problem. Disease? Sickness? Disorder? Whatever it is, I need to stop reading into things that may not even be there, I need to stop assuming anything (because to   assume   is to make an   ass   out of   u   and   me  ), and I need to stop trying to figure out what people are thinking. I figure none of that really matters in the end. What you know is what you know.  I think too much. I�m working on that.
