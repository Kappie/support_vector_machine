(It's not very good quality, since I had to shrink them so they would fit in the tables of this blog. The original gallery is   urlLink here  , if you need a better view... although that's still not the best quality. Ah well.)    [edit]  Okay, so I uploaded them to my   urlLink GJ gallery  , where the quality is better. You click on the photos to enlarge them, and they appear as the original size. Just keep in mind that these photos were scanned, so as far as quality goes... hahaha yeah.  [/edit]                                                                                       Yeah, and that's it. Thank you and goodnight.
