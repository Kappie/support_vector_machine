(not in 'n out, weinerschnitzel, taco bell, taco bravo, the like...) ~carlie making dinner for us/potluck. we just need someone's house for this. ~scavenger hunt! with clues!  everyone needs to put their gift in a box with the same still to be determined size, as well as the same still to be determined wrapping paper. the thing here is ambiguity! by agreeing to participate in the secret santa exchange, you are thus sworn to secrecy and cannot tell your secret santa to anyone. NO ONE. i repeat, NO ONE. if you do, you are a hoser and a loser and the rest of the degrassi clan shall shun you for life. hella no kidding.  as far as the procedure for getting gifts, here are two options:  ~you dyke. these have been your friends for hella years. you better know what the fuck to get these people.  or  ~to make it easier, and so people get things they actually want, people can make wish lists and post it here on blogger or pass them around, whichever they prefer. here, i'll start.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  maggie's hella bomb wish-list.  ~love ~jason's mom ~the live 2003 coldplay dvd/cd set IN THE DVD BOX muthafuckas.  soooooo.... yeah.  we have like two weeks. let's get a move on it, uhhhhh.....
