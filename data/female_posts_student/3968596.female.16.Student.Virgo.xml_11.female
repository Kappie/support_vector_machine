I got the Silver pkg (which included two outfits along w/ the yearbook shots) and the cap and gown option. Now, I'm usually terrified of taking yearbook pictures...for me, at least, I always hate my pictures no matter what anyone tells me. In freshman and sophmore year, my hair was curled and lil too poufy---it looked like I had afro. Seriously. I hated it. In junior year, it was mostly straight but wavy---not so bad but I thought I looked way too happy in the picture. ::sigh::  Anywayz, the studio was so cool! Lots of fun backdrops. And it went by quick too...and painless. Fun, too. I recognized a bunch of people from school there. I was suprised that I wasn't nervous a lot---actually it would have been a challenge b/c the photographers were so friendly. Probably b/c they're pros, who knew exactly what they were doing---not like the bumbling fools hired at regular school photo shoots for the year, where the flash is blinding and the risk of blinking on film is high.  Well, I hoped these pics turn out good...I won't know till two weeks. Which reminds me that I need to pick up the stuff Kristine and I painted plus I need to do my b-t-w test...
