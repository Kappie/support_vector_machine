I got up early to go with my mom on some errands, came home to be bored and have to do my independent French course, then, this evening I went to babysit the genius kid...ask me later MR, where the parents were so late that I wasn't even able to go to the party to say goodbye to my good friend who's moving to Texas! pardon me while I vent a little!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH        Alrighty...well, I don't feel any better. My elbow still hurts from injuring it on the car...yes, the car, and my neck is so tense I can't even believe it, I have a terrible headache, and I want to go to bed but I tried and I can't sleep...wanna know why?  CUZ YOU'RE NOT HOME YET !!!!! I miss you, and your humor that sometimes only I understand...lol, I miss the way you can understand what I want before I even say it and vise versa...ok, so, the fact is...I miss   YOU!   Come home soon MR. ~kendra
