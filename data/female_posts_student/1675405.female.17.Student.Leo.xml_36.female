My parents are constantly yelling at me and biting off my head for every little thing. I have a lot of stuff on my plate right now, and I'm balancing it all surprisingly well considering my short patience fuse; however, they always "nitpick" for lack of better terms. Never say anything good about what I do, but just yell at me for what I haven't managed to do. Personally, I feel as if I am doing quite well, and I could care less what stupid little thing I get yelled at for the day. I have more important things to fret about, like my HOMEWORK.  Bye Bye Birdie play practice was tonight. God.... it is going so bad. Telephone Hour is okay, Sincere is okay, but One Boy is absolutely dreadful, and I feel bad singing loud because I am the harmony, not the melody. But Sarah DeyArmand doesn't know her lines, so on Wednesday when we do act one again, I'm belting it out. I'm tired of waiting.  I am just so freaking grouchy today, but oh well. People are stupid. Marie is really being dumb, and my sister is being ever so annoying and harassing about dumb and petty little things about "whether or not I have a boyfriend." I hate it. Everyone feels as if they need to conclude why I am the way I am, and what's more, tell me their conclusion. WHY? Because I think about it, tear myself up into shreds because that is exactly what I feel like right now, and feel even worse, because in all actuality, I am what they say.
