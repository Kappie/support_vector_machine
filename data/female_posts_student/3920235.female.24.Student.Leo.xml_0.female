But there are certain things that will make my blood pressureskyrocket ina matter of seconds. One of those things is people coming intoour home and disrespect our things and not giving a shit about it.    Justin came down Thursday night and basically the whole time he was here, he was a complete slob. He got bowl resin all over Todd's desk and didn't bother to clean it up. He left crumbs all over the kitchen counter. When Debby picked him up (after he called her to come and get him because he was bored), he didn't put his pillows away or fold up the blanket, and he left half a cracker on the floor and half a can of Mt. Dew on the coffee table. Oh yes, and he made some long-distance phone calls.     What the fuck?  He's fucking 15 years old and doesn't give a shit about the things around him, even if they're not his things. What an ungrateful little asshole. Todd told Debby that he was the nastiest fucking kid he's ever seen. And the rudest.    I will give him  some  credit though, because he came down clean and actually took a shower while he was here. That's more than I can say about the last time he was down. He hadn't showered in two days and his feet were so fucking disgusting-smelling that we had to leave the camper and come home at 2am and force him to take a shower. On top of that, he had athlete's foot.    What I don't understand is how he can have a girlfriend and an ex-girlfriend that chases after him, because he doesn't give a rat's ass about anything, including personal hygiene.     Grow the fuck up.
