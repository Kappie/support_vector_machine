Haha. it was like from the 60s.  So what mainy happens is this one girls boy friends tries to make her jealous and starts making out with this fake blonde. So she gets mad and is like "i hate you" and falls in love with this old man.  yeah.  Hahhaha. So at this one point in the movie this guy picks up the main girl and she was like "Ahhh! Let me go!" and he like starts kissing her [i told you it was a sick movie!] and the old man with whom she falls in love with goes up to them both and he was like "Excuse me sir, but your molesting that girl."  I have no clue why but it was REALLY funny at the time.  Then we went to comedy sports. It was kidna akward though because it was just Me, Larry, and Heather...Larry and I volunteered for a game and they were like "What ar eyour names? and we were like "laura and larry" and they were like "Laura and larry.awwwww." and I was like "WHAT?  yeah...akwardness.  They gave us a gift certificate! wahoooo   now I am NERVOUS.  but guess what!  Larry and Heather don't like scary rides either!  And get this: Larry's favorite ride is the TEACUPS! YES!  But now I am really nervous about the competition. What if we get out in the first round?? That would suck.    Hmmm.....   YEAH!!  lallalala.  I just had another soda.  I am kidna addicted...  But I guess that is all, I will probably post something inspiriing around midnight ;)
