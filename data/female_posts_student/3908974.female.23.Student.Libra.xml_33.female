It goes beyond the cute liberal/conservative dichotomy.  It gets into emotional territory that seems dangerously familiar.  I think I might get hurt badly, and I want to steel myself against it without undermining our relationship by being too guarded.  What I really mean to say is that he's not as crazy about me as he seemed at first.  Politely, he's still heartbroken from his last girlfriend.  He still loves her a lot.  I have my own closet, chock full of old hats and musty secrets and burnt feelings.  But to hear about this "cosmic" love, to know it's on his mind, that cuts me to ribbons.  Why is everyone I meet in recovery and heartbroken over someone?  I really wanted to be the only one on his mind.    Jealousy is such a beast.
