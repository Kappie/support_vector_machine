Stop calling and texting me or asking my friends what I am up to or who are my new friends. It is no longer any of your business. You made your choice, now live with it. I feel really bad for your girlfriend, I hope she reads this and sees that you will always be a liar, cheat and will keep hurting people. You enjoy trying to bring up emotions in people, the problem is you have HURT me so much that, yes, I do hate you. Stop calling, stop trying to tell me that you love me and always will.. its bullshit. You had a VERY odd way of ever showing it, having sex with other people, while being in a relationship with me and lying to me, was that how you show you love someone? You do not know what the word is, and probably never will, nor do I care anymore. No I am not writing this with hopes to get back together, I am DONE, FINISHED. You have killed any chances. A friend had asked me, if I had the chance to tell your next girlfriend what KZ SHOULD'VE told me 8 years ago, I would tell her to " run, as fast and far as possible and don't look back." Regarding you car, I am not some little adolescent that needs to get back at you, I have moved on and have more important things to do in my life then to do something so immature, take a look at who else you have screwed over, it wasn't me, my family or friends. You really need some therapy, you are really messed up inside and will keep hurting other people, including your new girlfriend. I wonder how she would feel knowing what you were texting me with last night and that you wanted me to "save your soul," which is impossible for anyone to do. So move on, forget me, like you have before, and stop trying to hurt me more. GOOD BYE.
