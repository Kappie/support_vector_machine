(that whole fear i have due to whenever i temporarily lose my old license, plus can't renew car tags in a state i have no residence.)   and i'm now terrified that i'll fail the driver's knowledge test because i don't know the finer points of the graduated licenses and stuff of that pointless nature.  ...
