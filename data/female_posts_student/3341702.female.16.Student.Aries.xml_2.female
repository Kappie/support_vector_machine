Really really sad.  I don't think Jeremie ever told Vicky that we're dating though. Cuz...yeah...she doesn't say anything about that. Ever. Which makes me wonder if Jeremie will end up doing something with her when he goes down to Ohio...I dunno. I'm prolly just being paraniod...but still...I don't want him to do anything stupid, yah know? *sigh* I just don't know...he prolly has his reasons, or maybe she does know but she never puts that in there. I don't know...meh.  Anywayz...today is Jeremie's birthday...and I have to work. so that SUCKS. Cuz I don't get to celebrate with him...and it's Henry's birthday too so I'm missing out on that along with it. Grr...I'm missing out on so much crap cuz of my job. But I love my job...so it's kinda worth it..cuz I'm gonna buy Jeremie something tomorrow if I can get to the mall..which would kick ass..^^; lol.  Anywayz...notta much is really going on. My mom is being a bitch about how I can't go down there on weekends anymore...and it's getting on my nerves. My job is more important than going to see her for a weekend!! Who cares if she lives in Madison?!?! It's 2 1/2 hours away for christ's sake! It's not like I can go visit her and she can bring me to work or something like that. Plus, she told me to ask off on some weekends and try to see her, but I really don't want to. I mean...I love my job. I don't want to leave it unless I absolutely have to. So...yeah.  Anywayz...I hear I'm getting a promotion at work!!! *dances* Yay!! I'm gonna be working in Banquet!! ^^ though I will miss my buss job...considering that Jeremie will be a busser soon...so I won't get to see him all that often...;.; that makes me sad. I was so excited cuz I'd get to work with him...and now I can't. ;.; So not cool.   But that's all for now..^^ baiobaio!
