You know after somebody breaks up, this person’s friends usually end up saying sometime when they are trying to comfort him/ her: there are other fish at sea.  Excuse me, but that is about the stupidest expression one can say at a time like this! Do you want the person to just jump right out the window?  What one is ultimately saying is that the world is full of people: hundreds, thousands, millions, and billions of people. The chances of finding the perfect match, your soul mate, your dream man/ woman are statistically impossible. But hey, maybe you’re lucky…after all some people actually do win the lottery. Well, now to find the person who captures your heart who fills it up with joy and then to have him/ her toss back into your face and spit it out- well that can be a problem. Now this hurt person has already experienced this/ at least feels like he/she has, and you are asking them- no telling them to go experience it again?! Are you CRAZY?!!! There are also sharks in the sea, aren’t there?!! They’ve already gotten their heart amputated, what more do you want?   Hey, hey; then there’s the other saying: I’ve got bigger fish to fry. And another other: Something fishy is going on. What the heck is the big deal about fish. Fish this and fish that. Ewwwwwwwww!! Istaghfir Allah, but I don’t like fish.  WAIT A SECOND… do sharks live in seas? Whatever, that’s besides the point…you got what I was talking about. Actually, what I was writing since I’m not actually talking. Wait another second: not what I’m writing…what I’m typing.   But let’s talk about handwriting. I’m sorry you guys. I’m truly sorry that you can not see our beautiful handwriting and that instead, you’re stuck with this computer font. I mean, notice the word font. It’s got nothing pretty about it. But handwriting: the word handwriting: it’s like a flowing art…h~a~n~d~w~r~i~t~i~n~g. It’s so beautiful. Of course, not everyone can pull it off. In fact, you guys just stop lying to yourselves. I want you guys to be truthful to yourselves. That way I can be truthful with you. Okay, I guess we’re not ready for the full blown out truth: I’ll just say it mildly. Your handwriting sucks. I mean are you sure it’s your hand that wrote that, and not another part of your anatomy? Seriously, do you need handwriting classes or what? Sheshesheshe (our feminine version of heheheh. Yeah, GirL PoWeR all thE WaY!) We don’t have handwriting: we have calligraphy. It’s part of our blood.   Speaking of girl power: did we ever tell you guys that we have a part time job as ballerinas? We didn’t? Well of course we didn’t, because if we did then we would have been lying. Ha! Sadly we do not have part time jobs as ballerinas.   You know I had this really cool idea but I forgot it. Out it went- and flew into the sky, leaving me alone. All alone with the distant memory of having thought up of something remarkable that is soOoO ANNOYING!! Oh well. Bye (So abrupt yet so refreshing)
