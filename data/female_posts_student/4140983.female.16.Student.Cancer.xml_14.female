I wear my hair in a bun anyway. I got contacts. I'll use them for spinning, but not much else. There's no point in trying to impress anybody.  Purchases I'm actually happy about: I got my stepdad a card with a dancing lab, and it says, "I thought you might enjoy a lab dance for your birthday." I got my mom a Happy Bunny keychain that says, "Hi. Cram it". I got myself a copy of Revolutionary Girl Utena, manga, because a) I couldn't find the anime and b) why not? Lauren's got me to the dark side. I spent the last hour of my mall trip outside reading it. So cool. I have to get my stepdad a real present too. I have ten dollars.  It took me about fifteen minutes to get the contacts into my eyes, but once I got the first one in, the second one went in quickly. Then I had to take them out and start over. I go back in a week for a checkup, which is good. I have slight astigmatism in my left eye, and I can tell. They tried to make up for it by giving me a slightly stronger prescription, but I can't see as well. Everything's slightly fuzzy, and I can't really see distances. It's awesome, though, seeing what I look like without them. I haven't done it since I was seven, other than EXTREME mirror close-ups and pictures.  I made Dae a bracelet awhile ago but never got the chance to give it to her. If anybody else wants it? I can't really keep either one of them, they're upsetting me. I have a tanline from wearing it during Early Week, and I have to wear my watch over it. Anyway, maybe I'll just rip them apart and reuse the beads? Ah, I'm so proud of them. But they just...yeah. And I've decided to wait on making the necklace until I get an email back. I'm either going to do a peyote strap choker, or a RAW necklace.  I've started reading Wicked, I've still got Popular on repeat. I need to wash my face. You know, I don't even care anymore. Maybe I WON'T.  My mom assumes that because I had a small Mountain Dew during lunch that it's my new favorite drink. To be honest, I can't stand it. I thought the caffeine would help. It doesn't.
