I also need desperately to study, but have only done 26 questions on my first Geography provincial. Fuck. I haven't felt this sick in a long time. I hope I don't have some kind of stomach ulcer, or cancer. Fuck, my head aches.     I've been super cranky lately too, partly due to the fact that I'm sick, but also because I have no money, and seem to be working a lot for free. Nothing could be more depressing than volunteer work. Lol.    Frank puked. We both must be sick. Sigh, sick as old dogs. Sick as old ladies. Sick as your mom.
