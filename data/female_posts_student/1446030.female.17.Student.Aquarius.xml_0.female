I cant even resist staying beside her... cos..after oral pract, i cant even stop myself from going 2 lot 1 wif her to eat... such a failure rite? cant i jus let her go? y mus i expose myself to such danger?  I'm like a moth...forever attracted to the lamp which symbolises her. But...i'm reali happy 2dae. Embraced by pure bliss...(is dat e correct phrase 2 describe my situation?) Hmmz...i dunnoe whether dat is bliss or misfortune...but i'll let nature takes its own course. However, i'll still strive 2 keep a distance away from this 'lamp'. I'll be less sensitive, envelope myself wif more 'protective layers'. rite...haha...i guess i'm becoming more cheerful liao. She gives me life. She gives me joy. She gives me hope. She gives me the will to live. I need her.
