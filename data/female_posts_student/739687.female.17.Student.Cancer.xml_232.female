I guess I'm just going through some down time. It really sucks because lately I've just been feeling so wonderful, and then I dug myself into a hole I've already been in before. I just can't care. I have to stop caring about stuff and move on.  "Baby, baby stay Stay right where you are I like it this way It's good for my heart I haven't felt like this In God knows how long I know everything's gonna be okay If you just stay gone."  Hmmm...stuff sucks and wow. But I'll get over it. I'll dig myself out of this and it'll all be for the better.  Faith in better days, crazies. C-ya.
