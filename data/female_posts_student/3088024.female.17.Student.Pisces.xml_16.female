I really feel lighter with the burden of bitterness off my shoulders.  It might have something to do with fact I have stopped eating though too.  I got a compliment on my writing today.  I was told that even though the person doesn't agree with my point-of-view that my journal was well written.  How cool is that?  Now its not as if this compliment came from an English major but still it was nice.  Today was good.  I got caught up on some work, shot at the breeze, and sat bored out of my mind in study hall.  I really wish I could leave...more often than I do.  It is boring.  I have nothing to do except listen to the seniors.  Let me tell you firsthand, as a survivor of the mind-numbing, hearing about car engines and freshman for 50 minutes is not fun.  Independence is what I need.  I don't know.  I guess I can wait although it is pretty boring being seventeen.  Not much different than the boredom of sixteen.  I didn't accrue any rights or priviliges.  Just a day.  It will fade away.  So will everything else though I guess.  Everything reaches a peak and then just fades away.  Your body, intelligence, wealth, and some other stuff too I guess.  Vanity, vanity, all is vanity.  You know what's nice?   Holding someone real close and feeling them breathe.  Feeling their chest rise and fall.  Feeling their heart beat next to yours.  Not that I would know. ;)  I guess what I am trying to say is
