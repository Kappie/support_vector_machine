Now mind you I haven't attended a christian based church in years but have read and owned a bible and I am pretty sure I never crossed that verse.    This comes about because I was at the hospital the other day (reason is unimportant) and there is this old yellow boat of a car parked by mine. On the back window there are three stickers. The first one is huge and in the center of the window it reads     "Jesus saves"    All fine and good.    The second sticker in the lower left reads     "Guns cause violence like flys cause garbage."    Okay things wrong with this sticker are that no flys do not cause garbage they make maggots, much like guns don't cause violence, the crazys that can so readily get guns do.    The final sticker in the lower right corner read     "Guns, God and guts keep America free."    I laugh when Ishare that one with my friends. It is just so ridiculous.    So I left a note on the persons car, it read     "How many guns would Jesusown?"    Because realJesus didn't save with weapon or violence or acts of war,he just had faith and let that belief guide him to do what was kind and decent.    I am not aChristian but I think the bible is an interesting book. Its just to bad that most people don't get it and then kill other because of it.
