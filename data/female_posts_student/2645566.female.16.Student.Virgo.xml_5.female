The ride up to M'boro was interesting to say the least. Drew, wow, and Alex...man. Rooming with Leah and Andrea was great. It allowed me to get closer to two people that I considered friends...but weren't that close to. The first night we watched a movie and kaci came in (our rooms were connected..FUN STUFF). The next we stayed up until the wee hours of the morning just talking about whatever came to mind. It was great. I got to see people from other cities...friends...that I never get the opportunity to talk to. And that was just the beginning.  Rehearsals were hilarious, tedious, tiring, fun, exciting, etc. I don't know what was more funny: the fact that our conductor was old and didnt get a pattern and got excited over little things or the people that I was sitting around making fun of him. Either way, the music was great (minus one piece) and it was worth going. I'm glad I went.  Explanation of my name: On the way up to Mid-state, I had for some reason touched Drew's hair...a very rough experience. He said that all it would need was some conditioner..but he doesn't bother with that. Then he proceeded to say that a "friendly" shower would help as well. That would include a shower with a girl...hmm...interesting. So we joked about that for the whole weekend. Finally we concluded that "conditioning" meant having sex in the shower. So, "Man I need to condition!" would mean, "Man I need to have sex in the shower!"...good times...not having sex in the shower, but talking about that whole process...shutting up now.
