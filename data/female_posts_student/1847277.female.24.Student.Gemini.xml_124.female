Big deal.  Second, yahoo clearly beat google to the punch.  They have 2GB storage for subscribers to SBC internet or those who shell out the bucks, and 100MB (which is still a lot- it's more than my university provides!) for free.  Ah well. People are silly sometimes.  Matt and I have decided to go to Colorado in August, to attend a wedding we weren't directly invited to and to have a mini-vacation.  For some reason, I have always had this romantic, idealized vision of Colorado as a land of wonder.  Maybe that means I'll just be disappointed.
