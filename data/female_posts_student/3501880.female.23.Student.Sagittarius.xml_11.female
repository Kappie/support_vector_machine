Watching:   Coupling (the British version)...Not as funny as the Office.    Mood:   Four Hours of sleep tired.  __________________________________________  God, I am so tired. I am not sure what is going on with me, but for the last little while when I wake up, I have been getting really disoriented. Mainly, this manifests itself in  almost  using a beauty product for an unintended use. In the shower, I go to use my face exfoliator as shampoo. Several other times, I very nearly avoided using my face cleanser as toothpaste. Just know, I put a dollop of body lotion in my hand, and then in what felt like slo-mo, I brought my hands up to my hair, prepared to work the lotion through my hair. I feel like I am slowly losing my grip on reality.
