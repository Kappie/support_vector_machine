I mean its like LET IT GO ALREADY! It made me laugh once...or twice or maybe even 3 times..but after that..it gets OLD and u can LEAVE IT BEHIND... ARGH i hate it when ppl take jokes too far then it just becomes ruined.. like this chick i know..her and her sex jokes..k it was funny for liek what? the first 5 seconds..and she still goes on and on about them. I MEAN SHUT UP GET OVER IT! I MEAN EVERYONE IN THE GAWDDAMN UNIVERSE KNOWS THAT SHES NOT ABOUT TO HAVE SEX ANYTIME SOON...LOOK @ HER FUCKING FACE.. .I MEAN ID RATHER FUCK A DOG!!
