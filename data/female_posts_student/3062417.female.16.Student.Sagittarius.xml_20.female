And for some reason I'm in an almost good mood today too! Wow weird right?  Carol left my house at around 1 and after that I just sat around all day and watched tv. Pathetic, I know, but this is my life and I've come to accept that.  Since I am in desperate need of money right now, tomorrow I am probally going to go rake leaves for my grandma. Fun right? Whatever, she said she would pay me $5/hour which is better than nothing.  So, right now I am talking to Carol because she's my bestest friend ever and she's awesome. lol My speakers aren't working right now so I can't listen to any music so yet again there is no song for now. Maybe later.
