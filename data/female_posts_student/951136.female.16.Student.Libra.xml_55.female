"ya, how long does it take YOu to go through the museum?" ok. at 5:30 i was getting nervous. but gulam HAD to get something to eat at the cafe. we spent and hour talking there. by then i knew my parents were going to pull it again. i just knew it. they didn't care. it didn't make one bit of difference to them that it is SO incredibly damn rude to do that. first they lied to me. and then made me cancel on alanah and her parents. which pissed the HELL out of me b.c. i did NOT want to sit around talking for 5 hours. seriously. after the cafe we went out to eat. then we went to the book store. THE BOOK STORE! COME ON! then we went to an indian restaurant for dessert. its like they were rubbing it in on purpose. and they ASK ME why i dont want to go places w. them? b.c. they are insane and waste time and ruin anything that i had might have wanted to do. they stretch me to the breaking point. i spent enough time w. them to last me a month. so i got home at 10:30 last night. my parents call me selfish. i had to spend all night w. my dad's freind. i dont knwo this guy. i have no kinship w. him. so i wasted my night for my dad. i hate to say it, but it will be a mistake to give me a car. i'll never be home...but who says i'm getting a car anytime soon. all i have to hang on to is " three years"  another unhappy thought. am i isolating myself? probably,  i dont confide in alot of people. i mean, i have friends, but they aren't who i want to be around 24/7. i have very few ppl that i want to be around, who actually bring a genuine smile to my face. so? why should it matter if i'm not susie high school? i can invent people to talk to.  all right. enough with sounding sorry for myself. i did go to the mfah last night. and i loved it. the impressionism exhibit. amazing. really. i HAVE to bring notebook next time i go there, b.c. there were SO many paintings i absolutly loved and want to get copies of, but i've forgotten how did them, or what they were called! i wrote some of them down on my hand.   - Picasso - Girl before a mirror - Van Dungen - The corn Poppy - Hopper - New York Movie. - Picasso - Ma jolie and a bunch of Mattisses ones.   the pop art can go to hell tho. Art reflects the mind of the people and ideas of the ages....when i see that shit, its just sad... the red bird...about 200 miniscule lines of a huge canvas...EXACTLY. art reflects the trend of human kind. its all gone down hill. quite sad. everything thing great has already been done, so thats what they are left with to produce. obviously a lack of vision and skill. now i LOVE jackson pollock. and some of andy warholls work is interesting tho i didn't especially see the ones i liked on display. but over all the section i saw i loved. i recommend it. now i'm off, i need to go study for w. history....again.
