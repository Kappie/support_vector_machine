The only fun part was playing pens in sh w/ danielle, kate, mike, mike, adam, and billy. The rest was just stupid and pointless. So overall, today was an uneventful, boring, completely pointless day. I hate days like this. Also, I asked Sarah about the Battle of the Bands and she said I could go with her and Kim. It's Saturday at 7 at Mt Markham I think. Sarah's boyfriend, Alan's band is playing in it and also, I think Dan's band (Imperfect Picture) is playing in it. That's all I know about it so far. So I guess I'm going to that.  It's gotten so hard to get up in the morning. I just want to fall asleep and dream because dreams are way better than reality right now. I look at pictures of when I was the happiest person alive and think, "What happened to me?, What made me like this?, Why can't I be the happy person I used to be?". And I search, constantly, for the answers to these questions, and I find none.  Right now I'm listening to Allister and kinda talking to Gavin. Later I might be going to Kim's softball game. (?) I don't know what else.  Song: Hiding in back and never make a sound If you don't speak your thoughts They can't be turned around You lead a targeted youth Can't find the courage to leave your shell yet  Finding short term courage in a flask Another wasted day you're never getting back You lead a targeted youth Would only talk to certain few Can't find the courage to leave your shell yet Torn apart and...  Camouflaged in the background and holding things deep Never showing your true self to the kids you meet Finding shade in imagination One more day forgotten to the world  Hiding in back and never make a sound If you don't speak your thoughts They can't be turned around You lead a targeted youth Would only talk to certain few Can't find the courage to leave your shell yet Torn apart and...  Camouflaged in the background and holding things deep Never showing your true self to the kids you meet Finding shade in imagination One more day forgotten to the world    (One more day forgotten to the world)    Finding short term courage in a flask Another wasted day you're never getting back -Camouflage- Allister
