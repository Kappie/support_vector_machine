Weather is so hot nowadays in Singapore... *sweating and swearing* Going to watch The Matrix- Reloaded. the first marix movie, I was sitting comfortably on my sofa watching a rented Matrix video.... This time, with my friends... But in a way, I prefer to watch at home. I don't mind at all, ya know... ((^ - ^))--- Izzit nice? I thought of it just now. Oh, do you think I should go for tution tomorrow? I rejected my teacher since she had to go to malacca in the weekends AND my tution is in the weekends... I am at a loss... I feel that if I do not attend tution, I feel like I am a very proud and clever person, which in this case, I AM NOT !!! But if I attend, I feel so stupid and I also have a movie to catch... haiz... What Should I Do ? ? ?  Life has so many choices, but we always miss it and regret it for the rest of our life...   Waaahhhh, I can be so  profound ...
