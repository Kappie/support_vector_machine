Jason Mraz, Train, Coldplay.  ...Satisfied by your seduction like a handshake would do the job Never know how long I have waited, anticipated your smile to be pressed against mine...  your smile pressed against mine  Bright lights, big city Was quite extraordinary. The drive was pretty. I was in perfect company. The love of a lifetime, Since we were elementary friends; The one with the bright eyes...  Why can't I be optimistic? I tried to find the logic logically. I had a dream and I could not shake it. I was standing up there naked.  There's fear in the truth at hand, frozen I forgot to understand The live keep living; growing older more into a man... And I let her grow away from me.  The night. She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.  This time like every other time I believe that I never find Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again. And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lovely.  A whisper You came back to haunt me and I realized That you were an island and I passed you by When you were an island to discover  I can see the red, white and free in you You light the night up like the moon And underneath your clouds, I see the blue   You're hopeless 'cause you tell the truth The stars are jealous of your shine If you were mine There's not a thing I wouldn't do    Sing it please, please, please, Come back and sing to me, To me,  me.  Cause after every day The wind blows the night time my way And I imagine that you are Above me like a star And you keep on glowing And you keep on showing me the way  Say it again. Lovely. So lovely....to do it again Again.  Loving again.  It's coming again... It's coming again Lalalalovely.
