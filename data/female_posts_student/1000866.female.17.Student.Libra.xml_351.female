I went out with Chris to lunch, and we just hung out and whatnot, and then before going to Nikki's, I went to Joanne's and hung out with her, Mary Clare, and Kelly. That was cool. Haha, we were drawing faces on the balloons. It was funny. Hmmm, then I went to Nikki's, ate lots of pizza, and finally watched Lizzie McGuire!!!!! YaY! Haha. Then, I went out with Chris again, and that was it, but.....I was gone from my house nonstop today.   I'm still worried about this whole thing that I can't talk about in here...yet. I'm finding out tomorrow, but I'm SO SO scared, and it's not even happening to me.   I think I just need to go sleep.
