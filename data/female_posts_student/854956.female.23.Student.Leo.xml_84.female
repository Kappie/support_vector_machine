She turned 3, and well, the party was fit for a little princess and her court.  :-)  She got one of those jumping castles, which by the way is NOT made for tall people!!!  Her party was themed with Hello Kitty, and she got lots of items for her new "house," which is out back.  Oh man... she is SO pampered!  She has this little playhouse in the backyard, and it's all landscaped around it.  They're going to put in a pond and a little stream (which already has a cute little bridge over where it's going to be), and lots of pretty flowers and rock-work around the trees forming planters.  Oh my gosh...!  It's not even fathomable to me that someone could have it so good at age 3...!!!  What's even MORE unbelievable is that lots of the play appliances she got for her house are POTTERY BARN!!!   I  don't even have Pottery Barn stuff...!!!  Haha... We had a fun day... the kids played DDR... we were there all day.  After all the other people left and the only kid left was Trinity; Ricky, Wolf, and I jumped into the castle with her.  It was SO FUNNY!  She'd run out, and then Ricky and Wolf would act like they were going to "get me."  Trinity would run in and she'd growl at them, yelling "Leave my Kelsie alone!"  One time she TOTALLY lunged at them, throwing herself across the castle at them to save me, then she ran over to my side, patting me and hugging me saying, "It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.  I got you, I got you, I got you..."  hehe  It was the cutest thing I've EVER heard.  Well, aside from her yelling at me from the castle earlier in the day, "Kelsie, come here!!!  Don't you LOVE ME anymore?!?!"  Damn you, Ricky!  Damn you to HELL!  Other than that, not much has gone on.  My brother's coming in town on Thursday for Easter weekend.  My little cousin Travis had surgery this morning... he's doing good.  I'm anxiously awaiting the end of classes.  :-)  I just want it to be over.  So far I'm pulling 4 A's and one B.  If my final grades reflect this, then I'll make the Dean's List.  That is a VERY exciting prospect...!!!  Hmmm... OH!  I STILL haven't started on my 10 page term paper for World Lit... hehe  It's due in about 2 weeks... hehehe  I'll get it done eventually.  What else?  Oh, the new template... it'll be on here eventually... maybe by this weekend...?  We'll see... Depends on how much time the HTML Genius has this week.  Anyhow, now I must jet, I shall post something later (most likely for the Wacky Wednesday).
