Mom and I leave Wednesday after school to begin the college segment of the trip.  Then she leaves and I stay in Charleston with my religious school director, Abby, and the twins.  While nothing particularly vile is happening and I don't actively hate everyone going I'm not having nice feelings about the trip.  I come home Sunday night and have to go to school on Monday.  So then comes all the stuff due Monday and Tuesday.  Next week is the end of the grading period and that means that everything is due next week.  So while I'm in Charleston I will miss a calc test and an APUSH test.  Due Monday is the take home test for English and some poster presentation in science.  My massive history paper is due Tuesday and I just spent the past four hours working on it and made absolutely no progress whatsoever.  I have work tomorrow afterschool, an SLA meeting next Tuesday, an overdue Spanish journal entry, another one due when I get back because I'm missing the Spanish flex activity.  I have my their eyes were watching G-d study guide due tomorrow as well as two nights worth of calculus and the dogs won't stop crying, not to mention my mother keeps calling up the stairs asking me when I plan to do the dishes.  My room is so disgusting that I couldn't sleep last night and I somehow managed to make it worse when cleaning it, I have no clean laundry, or if I do I can't find it in the wreckage.  Kayla stayed home today watching movies and ransacking the house, all signs of illness mysteriously disappearing after all family members left.  Also, my phone is missing and dead somewhere in the house.  I could go on but I'm making myself feel worse instead of better.  Now I have to try and track down a copy of Kissinger's new book and somehow read it and incorporate it into my paper by Tuesday morning.
