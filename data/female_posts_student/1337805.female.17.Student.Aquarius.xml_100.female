Celery said that Asparagus and Leaks were playing and I got so....Moody. Asparagus is super confusing. First he tells me how much he loves Leaks, then he tells me he doesn't know who he wants, me or her. Meanwhile, his like, best friend, Jalepeno is trying to get down my pants. Maybe that's why Asparagus is tempermental and stuff. I'll tell him, I DONT WANT JALEPENO. Or maybe my problem is that I'm faced rejection again. A comment Tom made the other day really, really hurt. Why is a stupid reason. It jsut made me realize what he was really after, and what I wanted. Reminding me why we ended. There's still that lonely part of me that hopes I can change his mind and come running back to me. I'm still hoping for that con fling idea. I still can't bring myself to talk to San. The only reason this whole war started was because I needed someone else on my side besides Jess. His reaction was so out of the blue that it shocked, scared, and angered me. Then suddenly my good friends (some) came clean about their feelnigs, and I started to admit them to myself. I've even gone out and told a few people. It's making me a bit stronger inside.
