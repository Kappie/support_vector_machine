Hung out with F and his friends on Thursday night at Faegan's...man, I love 1Ls...and we all (except the sober driver J, of course) got piss ass wasted, freakin' awesome.  I had a great time that night, let's just leave it at that.  Friday I went out with my 2L "summer boys," as I call them, b/c I got pretty close with them this summer but haven't seen much of them outside of school when the actual school year started up again.  GAWD, I loooooove those boys!  I have nothing but a great time when I hang out with them.  I always end up drunk really early and I go home alone, but aside from those two things, I have no complaints.  They are some of the most fun, quality dudes I know.  Saturday...hmmm, what was Saturday?  Saturday I was getting ready for the mommy to make her appearance in Syracuse.  Got in a fight with the roommate on Sunday, a screaming and yelling fight, interesting.  And then here I am, trying to work on CT.  Ugh.  I guess I could sit online all day and avoid it, but honestly, the UCC is calling my name and I have quite a few more statutory provisions to get through in order to attempt to be caught up for tomorrow's class.  Not to mention I'm taking mommy-mo to the airport reaaaaaaaally early in the morning.  So here I go...bye bye, don't miss me too much.
