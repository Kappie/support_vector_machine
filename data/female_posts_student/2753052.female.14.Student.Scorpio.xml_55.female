I should really put some makeup on before I go. I don't think scaring old innocent ladies is a thing that I'm willing to do today. Tomorrow may be a good candidate for that though... Adi's coming over tonight.  OMG! I'm going to see the Notebook again tonight! I love Ryan Gossling. Must touch... *streches out arm* Neyeh. No use. So as i was saying before I so rudely interuppted myself...Adi is coming over tonight. Hopefully she will fix my webcam. It's starting to drive me crazy. Damn thing. I just want to throw it against the freaking wall! Calm down, Heather. *breathes* Ok. So now I have to go do my makeup and get ready for perfecting my oh so hopeless locks (which i personally really do love) by dying them blond. Well some of them. It's only hightlights. Not the whole shabang. I'm out.
