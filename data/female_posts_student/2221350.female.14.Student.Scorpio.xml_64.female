So I'm here, momma is pissed at mammaw, mammaw is pissed at everyone, we might go see LOTR,  and it's all good.  the last two days haven't been so much hectic as they have been... Congested. I've had all sorts of tests and projects i needed to do, and mom has been gone the last two nights((meaning mammaw was here, and i wasn't going to be on the computer if she had anything to do with it)). But I'm here now, relaxing.  although mom hasn't been here and I've had tons of schoolwork, I've been in a great mood since Sunday night when my mom's old friend Michael came over. He's cool and extremely smart.  Monday was pretty slow, slow enough, in fact, that i don't really remember what happened.  Tuesday was about the same aside from going to gym and not being able to play. Since the ROTC kids were using the gym, myself and the little group I'm in went to the dance room. It was fun, i think i laugh more in that class than anywhere else. Jonathan made up blues songs and played his harmonica ((there's a skittle on the flo')) ((is pank and purdy)) and yeah! On Monday i do remember going to 5th hour and jean and Jonathan ex-plaining skiing to me. Then we got on the topic of sonny bono running into a tree and we were talking and then i couldn't decide if i would rather be run over by a car or ski into a tree. We debated on whether or not the tree would rip you in half, and decided that it all depended on the size of the trunk.  "Nothing is beautiful from every angle". Someone posted that on their blog, i don't remember who. We are reading The Tempest in world lit., my favorite quote came from that play. I'll put it on here:  For that he was a spirit too delicate  To act their earthly and abhorr'd commands  Refusing their grand hests, they did confine him  By help of their most potent ministers  And in their most unmitigable rage,  Into a cloven pine; within which rift  Imprisoned, he didst painfully remain.  most people wouldn't consider that a good Shakespeare quote, but i think it holds a lot of imagery. i especially love the last line, so poetic.  my backpack is full of change. i filled a bag with all the change i had in my piggy bank((ok it's not really a piggy, it's more of a jar)), and put it in a ziplock in my backpack with the intention of going to a friends house and playing poker. Well i never got to play poker, and i forgot about the money until last week when the bag it was in busted and change spilled in the bottom of my backpack. Now when i pick it up or move it at all, i make a jingle noise. It's become a kind of inside joke among my friends, which is why i haven't taken it out yet.  alright, you know you read too many blogs when you go to the recently updated list and two of the blogs mentioned there are ones that you already read daily. i thought that was funny when i surfed over and saw Benedict's Blog at the top of the list. i also added a little butterfly to my site, i think he's supposed to be a traffic monitor, but he was just too cute to pass up! i named him fucknoodle. ((noodle for short)). Oh and please let me know if fucknoodle is acting weird, he's supposed to just fly around and if he's messing up the template i need to chunk him.  lately I've noticed I'm more banged up than usual. i have a sore spot on my head from getting hit with a cup((thanks ricky and Brandon)), a bruise on each arm from rough housing with my mom((i licked her so she punched me? No fair)), a big red streak where i burnt the shit out of myself((thanks bleu cheese popovers)), a bruise on my chest from being hit with a volleyball, little blood blisters on my hand from hitting a volleyball too hard, and for some reason the top of my left thigh hurts and i have no clue how that happened. The weird thing is, i think it's all hilarious, getting pummeled by anything((volleyballs, cups, popovers)) hurts for about five seconds, but you laugh so long about it afterwards that it seems worth the band-aid.   ok, i know it's their blog and they should be able to do whatever they want... BUT I HATE POLITICAL WEBLOGS! THEY ARE SOOOO STUPID! WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING AN ONLINE JOURNAL IF ALL YOU DO IS COPY AND PASTE CNN ARTICLES INTO YOUR SITE, THEN PUBLISH IT AND LEAVE US WITH A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT! i mean really! i also hate blogs that have NOTHING but song lyrics on them. Now hold the phone, i like posting the occasional set of lyrics on here, but every single day!?!?! So we never actually get to know the person, we just know that they're good at hitting Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. Glad i got that off my chest...  i was really hoping the Panthers would win. But i heard the patriots have four LSU players on their team. Pooh.  i was trying to explain to mom about how spongebob is like drugs because you can allow yourself to relax your brain so much that you are almost comatose, yet you don't miss any of the underlying jokes. she didn't get it, and said that whenever devon leaves it on tv, she sees that starfish and thinks "penis penis penis!" i told her that if she ever runs across any star-shaped penises, she should give the enquirer a call. she laughed.  wow, i'm so... glad about everything. ((hope i'm not dying))
