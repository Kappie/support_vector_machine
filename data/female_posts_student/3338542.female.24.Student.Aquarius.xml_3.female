There's so many things I want to say, but I know that it won't go the way I would like it to.  (God please help me)  I want to hand him a Praise  Worship CD that I've compiled to help me get through this tough time, but I just feel like if I try to hand it to him, one of 3 things will happen.  1. He won't take it  2. "escort" will grab it from me and say I shouldn't offer it to him 3. he will take it and destroy it in front of my face  someone told me that he is just using this trivial argument to find a way for the breakup to be my fault.. because he doesnt want me to break up with him the next time and it be his fault... i can see that.. hes been hurt so bad in his life... he told me once that he tried everything to push me away... and that i never left... we'll its true i never wanted to just walk away when i knew he was upset... i wasnt trying to stay as his girlfriend.. i was trying to stay as a friend.. I'm not walking away from this by trying to get my necklace.. just trying to take away something of mine from his possession because he has everything else that is intangible... everything else that can cause so much more pain...  I don't know how he's going to take me going there to get my necklace... he threatened to put a restraining order on me the first time that we had our argument (i dont know if it would have passed as grounds for me being restrained at all according to my Harvard Law School friend...), but still I don't want to give him a chance to make me out to be a harrasser... so.. I'm taking an escort.  I feel that because he is so sensitive that he'll freak out again...   he might get mad that i brought an "escort" with me to get something.. He might get the idea that I think he's dangerous..(which i dont) He might think that I am trying to make him look bad (im not) I feel like i have to do this.. even though there might be a chance that he'll be more upset that I brought a third party into this.. i feel like if i dont bring someone on my behalf.. he'll use it against me.. I'm damned if i do and damned if i dont... trapped....  I'm sure deep down inside the real Isaiah exists.. the one that talked to me on Sunday.. the one the broke down and realized i was there to help... the one that realizes that He isnt the only one that can get hurt....  I'll be there for him whenever he needs me if i can.. (even though my friends plan to physically restrain me.)  Well.. time to pray before I go.
