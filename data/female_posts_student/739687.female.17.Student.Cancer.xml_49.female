Anyways...I went to the carnival today...it wasn't all too bad. So then...not much else to say. Besides the fact that I have a contradictory mind. I think one thing, and at the same time think the exact opposite. My, how I confuse myself. Ok, well, I'm gonna go now and find something a bit more constructive to do. Au revoir.
