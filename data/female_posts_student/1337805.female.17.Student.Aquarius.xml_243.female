Been a bunch of busy, HOT few days....a beautiful heat wave rode in Tuesday, and has stuck around for a while...weatherpeople are saying that it's gonna be like this for a while, so huzzah! Been wearing skirts and finding other, nice, coool things to keep normal. Temperture wise, that is. Thursday and friday had a cross grade for English....Don't think I bombed it, but I know I could have done better on the short story paragraph...Poor time management, and easily distracted by the cool, refreshing looking sprinkler outside.. Thursday night, Tom drove me to Karissa's dance show at Spectrum...We met Matt, Dan, Nana, Sean and Nick there...watched Karissa dance. The theater kept getting hotter and more uncomfortable as the night wore on...but cute little girls dances, and they were really cute....:) Karissa was really good as well, the whole show was supremo..Tom nearly melted after watching Karissa dance to American Woman...as did every other guy there probably. Nick and Sean kept doing the funniest things too, so it was hard to be quiet and keep a straight face during it...It was awful :P And warm.  Friday, I had a practice math test, which showed I needed to study a bit more...alright, a lot more. Then I had a test in Earth Science, then my crossgrade. I burst out of my crossgrade exhausted and hot, and I just wanted to have a water fight, but then Nana and Sean invited Nick and me to the lake with them after school, so I ditched the water fight idea. That was fun. Durrance was crowded as hell, and it was hard to try and find a place to swim so we could be by ourselves, but we finally found a spot...It was nice, all the preppies float toys drifted over to us, and never came to claim them, so we floated around on those for a while, then just ditched them on shore, where they picked them up as they walked by (The only thing bad about our spot was that it was a quick, steep dropoff to the water below, and that we were RIGHT beside the path). Then me and Nana discovered the magic of using our boyfriends as floatation devices...Needless to say, I don't think I've ever had that much fun at a lake before...and...I really really wanna go night swimming now..Just..cause... I've never relaly wanted Nick more at that time :P Calvin swam over too, and he had to talk to Sean and Nana because me and Nick were..umm...swimming. Yes. Swimmmmmmmmming. Hee hee.. Unfortunatly, the wind picked up, and threw a few sharp bursts towards us, and then the sky clouded over with a big thunderhead, so we left. As we were getting changed and stuff, some guy walked by us on the path, and started commenting on my huge boobs, and what he'd like to do with them, etc. And then we were walking back to the car, Adam Steele whistled at me...:S Guess it comes with wearing a slightly revelaing bathing suit. Mom bought me a new one too, to replace my corderoy one, cause it isn't really for swimming. So that was sweet. And we ran into Kim and Karissa and the rest of Sandra's birthday party...that was cool.  We drove back home, and we noticed all these branches and leaves and pinecones and everything all over the roads..and then the lights were out at the interesction on Island View, and at my house..and at Nick's. It was very, very weird. Evidently the winds were very, very strong everywhere but where we were. Oh well. Hung out at Nick's until about 11ish. We had fun. :) As per usual.   Today, I woke up and did homework! And that's what I've done all day. I finished all my english homework, which is nice. Now I just have to do the thing on the planets, start that worksheet-y thing, and then study math. Hurray! I was outside today, trying to catch a tan at the hottest point of the day, but...it was hoooooot...:( So I went inside, where it's a tiny bit better. Mom *finally* bought a printer/copier/scanner dealie, so that means I can scan my pictures soon! I'm so excited, but we prolly won't set it up until tomorrow or Monday. Hopefully there'll be a water fight tomorrow too, I'm in the process of trying to set one up. It'll be hot enough for one, that's for sure.   Better get started on the rest of my homework, so I'll chat back :P Ciao for now, esteemed, bored readers.
