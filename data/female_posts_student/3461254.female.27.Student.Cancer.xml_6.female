Wow, my first DID experience.  Well, maybe I've had DID (Dissociative ID disorder--the fancy way of saying "Multiple Personality Disorder") before, but it's never been this confusing.  I am again in the process of updating my website.  Having pictures on multiple servers is a bitch.  I'm transferring everything big to Craig's account to simplify things.  Also news is that I've started playing Final Fantasy XI, my first online game.  It is every bit as addictive as any other bit of net-crack, and Craig and I are already chomping at the bit to play.  We can't play simultaneously, and logging in and out is an ordeal.  Jen, if you've got any time to kill, this is a rather amusing way of doing it.  Not sure if you'd like it, but it's definitely interesting.  Amber, you and Nick will love it, and probably fight each other to play--expensive though, if you don't already have the PS2 hard drive.  I'm Yunie, a Hume in Bastok on the Ramuh server if you ever get there :)
