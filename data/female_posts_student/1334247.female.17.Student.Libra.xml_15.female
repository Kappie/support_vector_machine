I don't care so much about all the other people watching, it's more about my family and close friends of the family watching me. But, I had to practice with the microphones yesterday at school, and there were people in the gym, and I did fine, so I'm feeling I'll do ok tonight. It's just the nervousness...but, hopefully that will die down a little bit.   Micki's home. This morning was already an adventure. We went across town to get breakfast at the old Country Kitchen. So, we sat down and before we ordered our food, Micki realized she forgot her wallet at home (which consisted of all her money). So, we told them we had to run home real quick and we'd be right back. So, we finally got home, and both of us didn't feel like going all the way across town again, so we went to the Ivy Bake Shop instead (which is just a few blocks away from our house). So, it's good that we didn't order our food at the old Country Kitchen, but we did tell them we'd be right back.
