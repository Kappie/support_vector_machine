Unfortunately, my anti hippie plan seems to have backfired just a wee bit. For, you see, I have purchased a hair product--a lovely shine spray smelling of orange cream pop things--made of, of cannabis seeds. Yes, that's right. I'm drenching myself in weed juice. nooooooooo.   and yesterday,I had decided to play my favorite joke on my parents. I bought some snap and pop fireworks (the kind that explode when you squeeze them) and carefully taped them to the bottoms of the toilet seats so that when the unsuspecting victim would plop down to relive herself, a nice little explosion would occur--mainly noise and smoke. But having forgotten that I had booby trapped the downstairs bathroom in addition to the master bath, I honkered my arse down. Needless to say, I immediately realized my mistake. Whoops. But I did get my dad. When he lifted the  his toilet seat to whiz a few popped and startled him.  oh. And I saw a very good documentary today called SUPER SIZE ME. Everyone in America must see this film. Save yourselves from McDonald's! Obesity is replacing smoking as the number one preventable cause of death. Being fat causes: diabetes, increased risk of various cancers, gallbladder problems, liver scaring and failure, kidney ailments, a myriad of heart and circulatory problems, as well as gastrointestinal disorders and difficulty sleeping. In the documentary Morgan Spurlock, a very slim healthy man, embarks on a month long McDonald's binge eating 3 square meals of fast food each day. Spurlock gains 25 pounds, lets his cholesterol go sky high, and abuses his poor liver while his vegan chef girlfriend worries over him and informs us that sex between the two isn't so hot anymore because burger boy gets too tired. Maybe that's why viagra is so popular...people are too fat now to have normal sex??  (oh, and if you click on the title of this blog entry, you will be swept away to Dear Mr. Spurlock's web page)
