And their husband will fix more things around the house. So let it go, and love you and your circumstances.  Think about it. The prettiest woman in the world can have hell in her heart. And the most highly favored woman on your job may be unable to have children. And the richest woman you know -- she's got the car, the house, the clothes --might be lonely.   And the word says if I have not Love, I am nothing. So, again, love you. Love who you are right now and let God be your barometer. Mirror Him. Look in the mirror in the morning and see how much of God you see. He's the only standard and even when you come up short; he will not leave you or forsake you. Smile and may God continue to BLESS YOU Real GOOD!!    "I am too blessed to be stressed and too anointed to be disappointed!" The shortest distance between a problem and a solution is the distance between your knees and the floor. "The one who kneels to God can stand up to anything." "Winners make things happen.. Losers let things happen." Be Blessed ladies and pass this on to encourage another woman. "To the world you might be one person, but to one person you just might be the world"
