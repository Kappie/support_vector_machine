Shannon said SO many funny things!! I could like not stop laughing.  Hahhaha. She was all like "You can make a cow go up the stairs but he wont go down" Hhahahahha...she said many other things, but thanks to my poor memory I can't remember them. :)  Lalala!  :D  Well, I better go!  I love you all..  :D  Laura
