She said she was tired of being the moderator and had her own problems. I feel so selfish now. I told Ginny about my problems, and she seemed a little resentful about me pouring them onto her. Mon and Gin both have their share of problems, they don't need mine. *sigh* The ones i need to care the most don't care (although I can't say I blame them), and the ones i need to care the least wind up caring too much. I hate people who try to fix things that aren't broken. If I don't ask for help, then I don't want/need it. So fuck off.  I'm sick of dealing with people! Let me be detached and blissful in peace!
