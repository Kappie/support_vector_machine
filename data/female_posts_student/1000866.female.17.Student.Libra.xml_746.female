And so, I find the picture I want, not even bothering to look at what website it is, then when I go to copy the location on here, it says it's from transexuals.org...    Interesting.     Well, that wont stop me from using a perfectly good picture. However, it does make me wonder why a transexual site that's probably clearly popular, what with having an easy domain name to remember, has a section on telletubbies. I do understand the great debate over Tinky Winky, but really...I don't know. That's a little weird, even for me.    But, anyway, I was looking at some of the pictures and, I realized how long it's been since I watched the show. Look at this place. Who wouldn't want to live there? And, you get more than the nice land, you get the dictator baby face as a sun!
