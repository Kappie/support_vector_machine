(funky Tut) Did you do the monkey? Born in Arizona, Moved to Babylonia (king Tut).  (king Tut) Now, if I’d known they’d line up just to see him, I’d trade in all my money And bought me a museum. (king Tut)  Buried with a donkey (funky Tut) He’s my favorite honkey! Born in Arizona, Moved to Babylonia (king Tut)  Dancin’ by the Nile, (Disco Tut) The ladies love his style, (boss Tut) Rockin’ for a mile (rockin’ Tut) He ate a crocodile.  He gave his life for tourism. Golden idol! He’s an Egyptian They’re sellin’ you.  Now, when I die, now don’t think I’m a nut, don’t want no fancy funeral, Just one like ole king Tut. (king Tut)  He coulda won a Grammy, Buried in his Jammies, Born in Arizona, moved to Babylonia, He was born in Arizona, got a condo made of stone-a, King Tut!
