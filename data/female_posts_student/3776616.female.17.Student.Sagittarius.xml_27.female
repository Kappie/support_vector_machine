And scaring people, b/c that's always fun :)  Then we walked down to Pier 1, b/c neither of us had been to this one yet, and Lainie didn't really want to go home.  We picked out all the stuff that we'll eventually have for our houses... :)  Themed rooms of course, b/c that's the best way :)  Then we sat in my driveway listening to music and fogging up the windows until Lainie had to go home.  Muahahahaha!    Anyway, dad's home and I'm bored, so I'm gonna go in my room.  I still need to give him an answer on whether or not I'm going to Florida w/ him and Kait. Should I?  The idea of being alone in the hotel room/timeshare w/ Kait while he's working doesn't seem all that appealing to me, but beaches and whatnot.... Hmmmm...  Idk, he needs and answer by tonight, so I suppose I'll figure it out.  Anyway, later!
