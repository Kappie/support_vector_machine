Unfortunately I can't discuss the rant that is  just BURSTING out of me right now in detail.... all I'll say is that the  urlLink UAW  is involved. Though no one at work reads my blog.... YET  I'm sure more detailed accounts will follow.  Umm....Guy? Can I borrow Rules for Radicals when you're done?  *(Guy I went to thesaurus.com to look for another word, but no other one describes me as accurately as that one. We're simply going to  have to share)
