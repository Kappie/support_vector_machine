I don't know yet, or maybe even longer between updates. I don't really have alot to say about the past week. I went do DHOS yesterday, and it was lots of fun. Got some new anime, but the only problem is the only thing that can play them, my computer, is currently soundless. Quite the problem if you ask me. So here I am, 2 anime series, and no sound. I tried to use my mom's computer, but I'm not sure if that would work or not. I'll ask her about it later. Also, I'm one week closer to getting to see Kristina, which is a big plus. Come on time, start flying. I've got to wait until March or later, and it ain't fun. Anyways, maybe this next week will be full of cool, fun stuff that will happen to me, or it's gonna suck. I don't know yet, but time will tell. Also, anyone want to buy me a new cd player? Just wondering.
