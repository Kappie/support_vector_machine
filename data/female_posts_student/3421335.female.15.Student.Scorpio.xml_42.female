The remaining loneliness Why the moment I open the door He didn't light my heart  He doesn't know, he still don't know Leaving was only Heaven's will: Stay away from me If I say what's in my heart It will be the warmth I desire  He doesn't know, forever won't know An embrace could be everything This love must have been enough  What I want would have been loneliness I sigh my woes in the cold and it floats away The past memories holds a grudge in my heart he didn't say a word but my tears flowed It's not that he didn't give enough It's that I don't know whatI want  He doesn't know, he still don't know Leaving was only Heaven's will: Stay away from me If I say what's in my heart It will be the warmth I desire  He doesn't know, forever won't know An embrace could be everything This love must have been enough  Beacuse I had harboured too many wishes My shooting star had been too heavy It's time for my heart to go back  He doesn't know, he still don't know Leaving was only Heaven's will: Stay away from me If I say what's in my heart Will be the warmth I desire  He doesn't know, forever won't know An embrace could be everything This love must have been enough
