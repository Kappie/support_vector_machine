Captured on numerous 8 1/2 by 11 sheets of a lost passion that was once so vibrant and lively, it has now become the vaguely remembered past of the lifeless being I have become. It was once the portrait of youthful aspirations, engulfed with loving support. My words were eloquent yet simple and touching, flowing from the heart of such an innocent child. But I am the anti-masterpiece; the once wonderful, now shameful prize that past supporters scorn for their foolish faith in something so disappointing. My 8 1/2 by 11 sheets of paper are tucked away painfully in cluttered drawers, out of the eye of the public, and hidden from a shattered, empty heart. My words once so beautiful are crude and lifeless, and are the meak attempt to rebuild an innocence that is far beyond repair. My soul is now the image of blurred and lost dreams; a work of art that the world is unable to love.   Well, that's all crazies. Have a spiffy day.
