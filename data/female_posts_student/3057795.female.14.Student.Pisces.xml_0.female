Been a while since I felt this way. Just hearing her voice makes me smile, her mere existence makes me go on. I know that somehow we would have to part ways but I won't let go, not now, now that I found what my heart beats for. ".....i have no idea if that entry was for me .......or HER......how i wish i knew...what makes me think that it's not for me?..well,mag-on na sila at that time eh..but my besty,whom i just spoke to a while ago told me that it really might be for me...she told me "  minsan may mga tao na mare-realize nalang nila na mahal nila yung tao kapag iniwanan na nila  "...can that really be true??...i have no idea..................i hope so....=(...ito pa..during that very same day, he had another entry..made just for me coz it had the..-08-........    1:05 p.m.    even if they steal my heart   they'd give it back   'coz they'll realize   it only beats for you    they could take me away   but it wouldn't matter   'coz whatever happens   I would always come back to you    they would never have me   'coz I don't want them to   I only want to be here   in your arms... it's true    -08-     2004-03-14 - 2:54 p.m    in thought you might say you have many rivals, but here in my heart you will always stay unrivalled...      2004-03-15 - 12:32 a.m.   You First Believed Lyrics     How many times did I pray  You'd find me  How many wishes on a star  Gazing off into the dark  Dreaming I'd see your face  Safe at home unafraid  Captured in your embrace   So many times  When my heart was broken  Visions of you  Would keep me strong  You were with me all along  Guiding my every step  You are all that I am  And I'll never forget   It was you who first believed  In all that I was made to be  It was you looking in my eyes  You held my hand  And showed me life  And I've never been the same  Since you first believed   There were times  When I'd thought I'd lost you  Fearing forever was a dream  But it wasn't what it seemed  Placing your hand in mine  You could see in the dark  You were guiding my heart   It was you who first believed  In all that I was made to be  It was you looking in my eyes  You held my hand  And you showed me life  And I've never been the same  Since you first believed   How many times did I pray  You'd find me  How many wishes on a star      2004-03-15 - 1:18 a.m.   [ Verse 1]  I brought you here so that i can express the things i've been thinkin bout give me your ear.  cuz i don't normally do this so bare with me through this. there are so many things that i  want to say. but let me start by saying this saying i thank you. darling just because..   [Chorus]  i used to love someone that i didn't like we used to want to break up every other night. i  used to think realationships were a lot of stress. i used to think that pain was a part of  happiness. now all that's changed since you've come my way, but i don't want us to become  another used to be.   [Verse 2]  I hope what i'm saying don't discourage you in any kind of way cuz i do believe that you have  the potential to be everything i need. i hope that you can really understand that i would hate  to be with someone new, and tell them what i'm telling you.   [Chorus]  i used to love someone that i didn't like. we used to want to break up every other night. i  used to think realationships were a lot of stress. i used to think that pain was a part of  happiness. now all that's changed since you've come my way, but i don't want us to become  another used to be.   [Verse 3]   cuz it would only be another waist of time and all the moment to be raised i would bout my  mind. another memory a part of history. I cant forget cuz it keeps haunting me. Now that your  here is evidently clear, but i don't ever have to have this worry again again. ooohhhooooooo.   [Chorus x3]  i used to love someone that i didn't like. we used to want to break up every other night. i  used to think realationships were a lot of stress.i used to think pain was a part of  happiness. now all that's changed since you've come my way, but i don't want us to become  another used to be.      2004-03-16 - 10:02 a.m.    Moonlight   It was a day that I would never forget…   I was sitting by the window holding my guitar playing my heart out. It was then that I saw the girl walking alone under the moonlit streets. She looked at me but I looked away, I love someone else after all. So she went on walking. The next time I met her was at the local coffee shop, where I always stop by to buy a vanilla frapuccino. We talked awhile and went our separate ways thinking it would be the last time we would see each other. But I saw her again that night, but this time she was crying. So I went out and walked with her. She fell in love with someone she wasn’t supposed to, and she told me all I needed to know. So, she said it was better if we parted ways, because she knew I love someone else.   She passed by a week after and asked if I could be with her one last time. I couldn’t see anything wrong with that. So we walked and sat down under a lamppost. She held my hand so tight, and then she looked at me and walked away. I tried to go after her but I thought it was better if I didn’t. So I went home and went straight to bed.   I called her up, she was surprised to know it was I, and I told her something of mine was with her. She put down the phone. I sat down and the phone rang, it was she and told me, “I don’t think it’s with me but if I do find it I’ll return it to you as soon as possible.” “You don’t have to return it,” I replied. “I thought it’s important to you,” she said. Yes, Very. And we hung up the phone.   I thought I wasn’t going to see her again. But as I was sitting outside the coffee shop, she passed by. This was my chance, my only chance, maybe even my last, so I stood up and called to her.    “I think you have something of mine”  “What is it?”  I paused awhile and took a deep breath  “My heart”  …And we became silent  “You don’t have to give it back, it’s yours”   And she stopped and she looked at me and we kissed under the moonlight   -080-     ...but of course...this was back then.......ngayon?what's his entry... 10:41 p.m.  " I just realized that the feeling of wanting to be with someone the rest of your life IS true. Maybe because I only felt it now...with her ."  ....now this is definetely not me...but HER............mahal nya talaga siya no????????????i hate my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ganito ba talaga kasakit at kahirap magmahal?!?!?!?!?!?...*sigh*     Forgive Me Forgive my mind for it can't forget the day we met, The day my world turned upside down The day I finally said that my life had begun. Forgive my soul for all it can see was that we were meant to be for each other It doesn't see that we may never be. Forgive my feelings These feelings for you that I just couldn't kill Feelings that would take me back to yesterday Feelings that would recycle my hatred and make me love you all over again. Forgive my heart for all it wants is to love you still Even though it knows that you already belong to someone else     I LOVE YOU EVEN IF IM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LOVING YOU ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUT I DONT THINK YOU'LL EVER SEE...YOU WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND ME............DAMMIT!HOW CAN I MAKE YOU SEE?!?!?!?  ..... I KNOW THAT A MILLION WORDS WOULD NOT BRING YOU BACK..........BECAUSE IVE TRIED.......AND SO WILL A MILLION TEARS..............BECAUSE IVE CRIED...............AND I STILL DO EVERY SINGLE NIGHT..........  ......oh boy...di nananman ako makakatulog nito....haiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.........................=(
