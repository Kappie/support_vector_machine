Happy face, cheery, bright, and smiling.   Some know   Some don't   But no one cares   I act like I don't either   But each night   The tears fall   Upon my pillow   as I stare at your picture   remembering every hateful word      In the shower   the tears are again disguised   your words cut deep   as does my razor   But no one knows...Or cares...
