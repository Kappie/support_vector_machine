I know that this has been a rumor for a while, but they now have  urlLink actual actors  and are trying to get  urlLink reindeer  for the White Witch's sledge.    This has got to be prompted by the immense success of  Lord of the Rings  and the Harry Potter films.  Any guesses on how faithful the Narnia movie will be to the books?
