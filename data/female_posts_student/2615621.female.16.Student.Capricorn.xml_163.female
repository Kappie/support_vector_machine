Because..well......hmm...enough said.  Charlie (east surry) just told me he missed me and was glad i was coming home early..haha but then he added "FUCK! im going to cali july 18th-31st!" and we decided we will both be in town saturday afternoon and nite...hahahaha. he lives right down the road..so u know...  Alrighty, im done here...im sittin here naked in a towel!! can i getta "whoop whoop"?! things are great..bay is telling one of her friends to pretend she knows me..and talk to danny..hello, thats weird. dont pretend u know me and say a bunch of lies about me to a guy...hes gonna see right through that. "yea julia has pretty brown hair!" danny: "oh, i thought she was blonde".."oh yeah! thats what i meant..shes blonde!" fuck. my life is going down a waterslide and hitting the sides on the way down. hope i dont crack a rib.  *much love and rubber stamps*
