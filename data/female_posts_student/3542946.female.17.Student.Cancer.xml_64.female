The film telling the other side of the story, commercial (channel 9) media wouldn’t dream of showing.  Though funny, this film presents serious and present issues, having some very disturbing scenes inappropriately followed by a hilarious George W. Bush anecdote.  Throughout this film I foundme grinding my teeth out of pure hatred of the us government and restraining my self from charging at the silk screen, yelling abuse at the war hungry tyrant pictured before me.  There was no mention Australia's involvement in the Iraq war, which shows how little impact we had for all the trouble it caused.  The film focusing onexposing bush and his lies to a mindless nationblinded by media, government, confusion and patriotism.  This film doesn’t really have the charm and humor used in 'Bowling for Columbine', using hard facts and having a greater emotional effect.  I would definitely recommend this film to all, I think Peter and Mavericks should definitely see it just for research sake or to open your minds.
