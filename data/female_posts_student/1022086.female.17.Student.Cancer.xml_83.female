I was supposed to wake up now, but because I'm so used to getting up super early no matter how tired I am, I woke up an hour ago thinking it was now. So, I go up to my mom's room ten minutes ago and ask if she's ready.  She kind of looks at me and says, "Now? It's only 9:00." "No, it's not." "Yes it is. Look," as she points at the clock.  Then, it finally dawnes on me that I hadn't really heard the alarm clock as I thought and that I had, indeed, screwed myself over to one less hour of sleep. Eh. At least it's not as bad as that time that I woke up at 8 pm thinking I was super late for school. That time, I actually got ready, walked in the living room to see my sister and her boyfriend watching TV, and interrogated them about what silly reason would cause them to be up together at 8 am watching TV. Then they elightened me, and I felt stupid. Hehe.  Well, I've got about 40 minutes to kill, so breakfast it is! Yum! And then off to school for 2 pointless blocks and a Crackulus exam (wish me luck!).   Arrivederci!
