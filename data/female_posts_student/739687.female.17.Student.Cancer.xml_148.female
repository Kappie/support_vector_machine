Like, the one above the C that's above the staff. Damn it was cool.  Anyways, enough of that. *Sigh*...and blah. I'm sleepy...I'm always sleepy. Most likely because I never sleep. I've had alot of trouble focusing on anything or anyone lately...so badly that I can have zero distraction and still not be focused. And it's not like my mind wanders or something catches my attentions...it's that I just stop thinking completely...just blah. Haha...it's cool though. No one really has much to say of any importance anyways.  Alright...adios crazy kids.
