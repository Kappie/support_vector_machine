Brandi's surgery really accomplished nothing; they removed very little of the tumor--only enough for a biopsy; it was not encapsulated, and was already spreading so much into her temporal lobe that it was nearly impossible to distinguish normal brain tissue from tumor tissue, and removing the "whole thing" would have left her paralyzed and without the ability to speak.  Other than a general siezure last night and headaches, she should be recovering well from the actual surgery.  We won't know the final prognosis for another couple of days, when the pathology report comes back.  But when your neurosurgeon comes in and says, "Let's all have a prayer--we need a miracle"...that's not good.  Bottom line is that she (the surgeon) wanted to prepare us for the worst-case scenario.  I appreciate that, but at the same time it is quite difficult.  We're not going to mention any of the gory details to her until she's more recovered and we have the final pathology report.  I'm assuming that her oncologist will discuss the final prognosis with her.  I really want to be with her there when that happens, so I'll probably be back in Houston or in the general vicinity by the end of the week.  The good news (if there is any to come out of this) is that she has a fantastic support group--hundreds of people have visited her within the last week.  She will not be without people who love her very much to help get her through this ordeal, and I know that she's a strong person with alot of faith.  When it's all said and done, she's got it covered--either here on earth with her friends and family or in heaven with her daddy.   But she is very scared, and needs all the prayers that she can get.  Today is Brandi's birthday.  She is 23 years old.
