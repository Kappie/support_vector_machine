The sun isn't shining, I'm the only one who wore a t-shirt today in my class, my fave pants are this close from wearing out, I'm tired, I'm feeling sweaty, there's too much work, I just ate a donut, and everything's wrong.  Heard at school that the biggest modern art museum in the country (Kiasma in Helsinki) had bought a videowork, where the 'artist' gets a cat from homeless animals center, tortures it in various ways and kills it with an axe only to masturbate on it. Signed a petition to stop that kind of thing to be displayed and concidered as art (instead of the torture that it truly is). Yeah, yeah, it's not the same as all the cruelty that happens to people in the world, but it still made me feel sick.  Can't say that learning about that made my day any better...  What more could I complain? I don't know... I just feel so tired of everything right this moment... I don't want to take care of anything... although I know I should do all kinds of things.   The next 3 days ahead depress me also.... nothing but lectures of surgey all day long, 3 days. Nothing variable... school on saturday, bleah!  I'll write again, when I'm feeling better, should be writing an essay on feminism... once I get myself to do it... most likely not today. All I wanna do is zzzzz....... but can't.
