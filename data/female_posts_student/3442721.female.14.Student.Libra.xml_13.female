I realized this after one of my so called friends decided that she wanted to hang out but I wanted one of the post members to come and my friend said no because she doesn't like the group. So I'm not going any where with her! I'm happy to have my post though because I know they would stick up for me. Unlike my friends who would back down and shut up if a prep insulted me. I had to defend myself and with no support to hold me. It was like being on the high dive with no water in the pool.   I love the way the place is run too. Officer meeting, our meeting, break, learning. See it is fun. I just wish some people would understand that a post is more then a few people learning EMS, it becomes you family. That is what I love most of all.
