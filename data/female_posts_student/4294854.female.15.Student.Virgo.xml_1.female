Talk about mixed signals. One day a guy will act like he likes you but then the next day he barely talks to you...whats that about huh? I mean come on if you like a girl just ask her out what can it hurt. So she says no at least you got the courage to do it. Its so frustrating. Ive had so many guys like me (and i like them back) but never come and tell me then when its too late come and tell me they like(d) me. And why is it (no offense) but all these rude/slutty/ugly/mean people get boyfriends and nice friendly funny pretty people dont get boyfriends. It makes me soo upset. Well i cant rant n e more. Bye
