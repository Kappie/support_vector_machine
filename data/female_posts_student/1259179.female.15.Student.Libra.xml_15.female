You basically know about all the medical problems I have had since November... well it all started with my conclusion that I needed help losing weight ~ Surgically ~.    Well he wants me to see a gastric surgeon before he operates. which won't be before the fall.  He feels that I can't loose weight on my own and KEEP IT OFF... Who Am I kidding...I can't even loose 5 pounds on my own...  I am sooooo confused.  I am trying to keep my mind off of this.  I am looking for web design sites with FREE graphics.... anyone know where I need to look...  I really appreciate it..  On this Jeudi soir,  have a nice tv night and ..........Be good
