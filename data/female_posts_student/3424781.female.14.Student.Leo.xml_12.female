I have on A long black vest  dark jeans. I also have on a black band tee. (the band is Neat-O, a local ska band.) Then I have on three necklaces. One is a black string with a silver peace charm, another is a silver chain with an antique key on it. The last is a silver cross that I got from one of those 50 cent machines. And last but not least I have a black sorta fedora hat. So cool. If I can get a pic it's going to be in my portfolio.
