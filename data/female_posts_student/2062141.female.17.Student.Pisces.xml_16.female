And you'll laugh.  *A new definition of a tortured artist* Too... many... projects.... I have to draw the posters for Alice in Wonderland, finish my cup in pottery, work on my portfolio, and paint these 2 four foot tall megaphones for cheer. Just out of the goodness of my heart. Stupid Mr. Grossman and his convincing ways. I better get credit for this for my damn portfolio.  Halloween is almost here... I used to love Halloween.... I still do... if only I was like 5 years younger. I so have the best neighborhood to trick or treat in. Damn. And that stupid football game ruined any and all plans of a Halloween party. I wanted to dress up... I've done NOTHING on Halloween, besides handing out candy to snotty tweens and silent kindergarteners ("Say thank you Davie....")... And I have so many cute ideas for costumes... Tinkerbell, Betty Boop, Peter Pan... i had a million i swear.... but I'm destined to spend another Halloween by the door. Maybe I'll scare people this time. Maybe I'll go to the damn football game. Yeah... then Charlotte and Nick can just come to my house... no to Seattle... we can go to one of those delightfully lame haunted houses. Yeah... maybe it will be okay.  Another drama filled day... these are my conclusions, though they probably mean nothing to you... I don't want to play the innocent card anymore. Don't act like you know how I think. I don't want to put faith in people who betray it without batting an eye. How am I supposed to care about you if you don't care about yourself? I do care about you. But give me a reason to. You don't know how many times you've let me down.
