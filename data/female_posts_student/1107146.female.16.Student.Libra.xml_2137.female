I was on the computer checking my e-mail and blogs and my twelve year old brother came up here and told me to "get off, I have to do homework" ths sounds like a reasonable request; until you realize he had been on the computer for at least three hours already this evening (we had gotten home approximately three and a half hours before this point, and the half hour not accounted for was dinner) and for at least two and a half hours I watched him play games on the computer.  So anyway, he comes up here and demands the computer again because he forgot to do something, at this point it's approximately 6:30, giving him at least two and a half hours before he has to go to bed, plenty of time to get back on the computer after I get off in less than five minutes.  So I tell him he can wait the five or so minutes it takes for me to check my blogs and respond when I think it's necessary.  He then goes berserk, crying, stomping, whining, screaming, temper tantrum, runs to mommy dearest, and demands she make me get off.  She then yells at me for "being a computer hog" Anyone whom knows my mother will find this extremely funny because she spends at least ten hours a day on said machine.  And he proceeds to run up here and stick his tongue out at me and generaly look like he won. At this point I'm to this blog and I decided to start a topic about him.  so he tries to get me off for several more minutes, in which I type the message, go to all games free, play several games of collapse, etc.  I finally decide his frequent kicking, screaming, and biting has become annoying and decide to allow him to do what ever it is he's spitting about.  So he sits down witha smug look on his face to print off whatever it was, then he proceeded to go to Big Cheats or some sort site. This I decided would be an ideal moment to unplug the computer.  I didn't; but I did unplug the monitor and make it look like I unplugged the computer.  He then attempted to kill me in that abmisal fashion in which children think their punches actually hurt, but then I put my foot in his face (not kicked him, just put my foot on his nose) and he decided this wasn't a fight he was going to win, so he stormed off. At which point I plugged the monitor back in and shut the big cheat window and went back to what I was doing.    My question is why does he think he can get away with this?  What exactly is it that makes him believe that he can ever get away with this? and BITING? is this kindergarten?  Oh and I have a poll, I want to see just how special my brother is, How many people remember someone biting another person in kindergarten?  thanks
