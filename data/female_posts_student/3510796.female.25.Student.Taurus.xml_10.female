Every once in awhile I'll come back and add stuff 'n things.  I'm a sports freak, so my postings might all be about sports for a few weeks.  Like now, my Indiana pacers are in the eastern conference, trying to go 4-3 over the Detroit pistons.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed!  Lets Go Pacers!  More tomorrow, after the game.  By the way, CUBBIES WON!
