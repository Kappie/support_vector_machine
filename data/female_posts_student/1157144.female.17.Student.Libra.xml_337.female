ALSO: the district board meeting is on the FIRST OF MAY. i say we all at least show face there.  also to billy, you mean friday probably, right? i can go in and otu or whatever as far as i know. i really don't know what my "carnival schedual" is, i'd have to see. but anytime your bored, just call me beep me if ya wanna reach me homes.  i am so frickin sick right now...
