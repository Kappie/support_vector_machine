I have ample reasoning for conclusion that today was a shitpile, a disaster, a complete and total fuckup.   on the way to school mom mentioned((to someone she was on the phone with)) that she needed to go straight home because strangely enough, mammaw had asked her to and said they needed to have a serious talk. So I spent the better part of the morning conjecturing the details of this "serious talk" and came to the conclusion that when mammaw went to the doctor on Sunday he told her that her health was diminishing and that the cat would have to go. After anguishing the thought of losing my cat, I had to take a biology test((which will be important in a second)). Now please don't think me a selfish bitch just yet. I decided that if something was wrong with mammaw she would have told us by now and that the cat was the only other thing in jeopardy, which is why I wasn't reeling over mammaw's health.  so about that test.. Of course, I had studied all the wrong things, every single minute piece of information not mentioned on that goddamn test I know by heart. The reason I would study so fervently? Mom said if I didn't make an  A on all 3 tests I took today, I would be grounded from the internet.   so as of tomorrow, I won't be allowed online.   I....  i don't think most people would understand the way I am totally cut off at the knees without the internet. Some people have sports, some people have best friends, some people have fabulous lives or are too ignorant to realize otherwise. I, however, am not one of these people, I have an internet hookup and a knack for typing. blogging is my refuge, the way I center myself, the little part of my day when EVERYTHING is about me. My feelings. My ideas. My own selfish ramblings.  and yes, I do depend on the sympathy of complete strangers((well, strangers on some levels)) to keep myself sane, and yes, I believe without the sympathy or sharing of joy with others we'd all clutch stuffed animals, rock back and forth. And feel sorry for our own existence until we died. died wallowing in self pity. Died feeling that nobody cared. So do I feel this need to blog because "nobody listens to me!!"?? Maybe. But probably not. I simply enjoy it for the sake of space. space in my own head, that is. I take all these woes and throes and throw them into the computer, taking solace in the fact that somebody will know about it besides me. That somebody might have a solution, or a philosophy, or just a kind word.   I also do it because my ego tells me I have good ideas, and that I should spread my genius among the people. But that's besides the point.   enough spew about that.   I'm home now, enjoying my last day as a legal blogger, and thinking about mammaw.  her talking with momma had nothing to do with the cat.  my grandmother has colon cancer.   and you'll have to forgive my indifference towards the situation at this moment, as the gravity of it hasn't had time to sink in yet.
