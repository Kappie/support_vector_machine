"and emily did reorganize, and it was good."  except now my basement looks like a disaster zone. i coduln't find enough space for all of my music, so there's staff paper everywhere. i thought it'd be fun to just throw in the air out of frustration, and dance in the glittering mass like i did when i was little with monopoly money. and by when i was little, i meanfreshmanyear new year'swhen andrew, karen and i threw monopoly money in the air at 2:30 in the morning. but manuscript paper is heavy. it didn't flutter at all. i thought about sitting down and giving it a lesson in fluttering, maybe make it watch the opening of forrest gump and study the fluttery feather in that, or the plastic bag scene in american beauty. but would that really be worth it? i'd have to go rent american beauty. and i doubt that the empty staffs would have learned anything about the art of fluttering. the other day when i was playing taboo, i got flutter as a word. i coudln't say "hummingbird" or "butterfly" or "wings" or much of anything. but louisa still got it anyway. i'm good at explaining things without really using words. i was like "so...this animal flies...yeah...and when it....uh, flaps it's limbs really fast, it's...______ing, and..." see? i'm incredibly eloquent. ooo, boy meets world is on again. i'll see you tomorrow. well, not really. maybe acctually. tomorrow  is  friday technically, even though i'll be sleeping until it feels like thursday. i'm still on wednesday. time is so stupid. days should be measured in when you sleep. except then people who don't sleep for like three days straight would prolly get confusted busted. BUSTED! you know,their momwould be like "hey get up for church, it's sunday" and the kid would just be like "screw you, it's still wednesday in the mind of the INSANE!" because you're legally insane after a certain point without sleep, and so if he hadn't slept since wednesday, he'd be legally insane. pretty cool, huh? i should probably clean up before i go to sleep. and boy meets world is on. again. so no one told you life was gonna be this way *clap clap clap clap* ooo where everybody knows you naaaammmee BA BA BA when it's boy meets wooorrrllldddd pling! all great tv shows have a theme song with some sort of obvious onomonopia or however you spell it.
