While all my friends have cute visual aids... I am left out in the cold.  Both Simone AND Marissa have tried to help me with the predicament, but when they start talking all computer-ish my brain shuts down. Believe me, I don't want it to. I know that I should be comprehending it. I keep telling myself "Listen up here, Katherine!! This is useful! C'mon.... Don't nod off!!!!". And yet... What ends up happening?? My brain just starts to melt and the little red button labeled "WTF??" starts blinking.   Much the same with Math.  But the truth is, I seriously and hopelessly do not get computers, their codes, their files, their accessories, and ESPECIALLY their need to bombard me with pop-ups. An example:  I want an I-Pod. What can I say? I am a victim of good advertising. Those shadowy figures dancing around to catchy (almost hypnotically so) music is something I just cannot resist. But here's my deal: I do not know how the freakin' things work. I get that they play music without cds, that they can hold hundreds of songs, and they are really expensive, but I do not know how to download whatever it wants me to. Even if I did, I can pretty much guarantee I'd screw it up. The only way I will ever figure it out is if I ever come in contact with someone who (by some miracle) has this (and can properly use it) handy device, and they can show me how easy it is to work, and then make fun of me for my ignorance *ala* Saturday Night Live Jimmy Fallon-annoying-office-computer-guy style.  Another example:  I want a digital camera. Since I am turning 16 in July, I have a very high chance of receiving one, because I keep reminding my father that some kids get a car for their sweet sixteenth (plus the fact that he is whipped). However, I want the kind of camera that you can buy a printer for and you don't need a computer to print the pics off. Yes, I am so desperate to not interact with my computer that I will go to extremes to not deal with it.   But I should probally stop talking bad about my computer, since it is most likely monitoring everything I type, just waiting to attack.  Now I will have to stroke it and whisper sweet nothings in its speaker, just so it won't freeze.  ****  Song of the Day: 'Light Up My Room'- Bare Naked Ladies
