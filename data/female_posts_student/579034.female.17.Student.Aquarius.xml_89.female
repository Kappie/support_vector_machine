They get you dancing 4. They play good music 3. They have good bodies 2. They hand out those cool hats, sunglasses, inflateable microphones, twirlie things, and glow sticks  and the number one good thing about Sweet 16 DJ's...  1. They can make you feel sexy and pretty when they dance with you... and a few nice words can go a long way on the Self-Esteem Meter   The Bad  5. They dance so good they seem gay 4. They play gay music that only the parents wanna dance to cause it brings them back to the "glory days" 3. They play gay group syncronized dancing songs like "The Cha Cha Song" 2. The don't play the songs you request even when they pinky swear they will  and the number one bad thing about Sweet 16 DJ's...  1. They think they are the "Buffet Line Lords"... they think that they have the power to tell us when we can and cannot go up to get food even when people tell us we can.. and then they go and be a dick and say "Thank you Table 8 and 9 for getting up when they weren't asked and making the buffet line long".... penis
