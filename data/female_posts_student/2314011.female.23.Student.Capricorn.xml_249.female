I should write about the last few days, but haven't the strength, so that post will wait until tomorrow sometime after coffee and before quality futon-time. I think the biggest shock is being alone after having been surrounded by people non-stop since Wednesday; find myself wanting to have someone to cuddle, chuckle or cry with, but I haven't been great at chatting with the few people I've come into contact with today.   But the plants look fabulous...the babies are coming along nicely. Thanks, Calam.
