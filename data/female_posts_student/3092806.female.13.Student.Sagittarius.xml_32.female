Usually at school I am a mime during any given social situation that includes people other than my very best friends. I have no clue on what to say or how to act so I just don't say or do anything. I just sort of stand (or sit or lay) there, blinking at the person. God, I am SO clueless on how to behave around other people. People take this as good manners but that truly is not it. I don't know how else to act, I wonder what rude manners looks like... I suppose I don't want those, but for once I just want to be known other than quiet, smart, and polite by the general public... I mean, I don't want to loose my intelligence (though sometimes I've thought about it) nor my "good" manners, but I just don't want to be known as quiet. I want people to say things about me like, "Oh, she is SO much FUN to hang out with..." Or "She's got some seriously cool ideas..." Or "She's very opinionated about certain subjects but she's also very open minded about whatever you've got to say..." Seriously, that would be AWESOME. If only I weren't such an anti-social, paranoid, freak! I don't mind being a freak and paranoia doesn't hurt all that much but sometimes my anti-socialness gets to me... I mean, when I look around there are tons of kids hanging out with at least ten friends, doing crazy things... Ah, being different, sometimes sucks...
