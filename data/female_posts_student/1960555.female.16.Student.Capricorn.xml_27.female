I"m back again to how confused I am with... everything lately.  Well, yes, I am.  This whole "boy" thing is just getting on my nerves.  I JUST WANNA KNOW ALREADY!!!  I can't take the suspence.  (Russel Crowe is the man, he's so Gladiator it hurts.) By the by, Claude, you're not allowed to show him this bloggy thing... "How was your, um, hike?" LMAO (sorry, slight A.D.D moment there).  Have I also mentioned that Amy is seriously on crack.  We were awake until atleast 5:07 last night (it was the last time I checked the clock), and she had to be up at 5:30 to do the papers... so needless to say, she is quite delerious right now.  I'm rather scared actually.  -ducks and covers under Shane's blanket- I'm out youngens--
