We had fun, but they started talking about getting drunk and stuff, and I could tell David was just kinda...I dunno. Not upset but, just didn't want any part of that. Anyway, I went home and he called around midnight and we ended up staying on the phone all night (or shall I say morning). He is just so amazing, and he's the kind of person that makes me wanna be the best that I am. I've never met such a strong Christian and amazing person. I can't even describe it. He's leaving to go back to FL tomorrow, and I don't know what I'll do when he's gone.....
