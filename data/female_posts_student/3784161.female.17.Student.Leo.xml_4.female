Sometimes I feel lost, and always I am without direction. Disapointing, discouraging, dissatisfying - the three d's of my past year.   But I survived! I'm me, more than ever before. For the first time ever I'm not following people around with my tail between my legs trying to squeeze into conversation - I'm just naturally welcome. It's so nice to not be afraid to be alone.   As with so many things, I wish I could explain it. There are a few things I would have done differently, but I didn't know then what I do now, as lame as that sounds.   Anyway I'm happy. I look forward to tomorrow whatever it may hold. And I think I like my new blog. I wonder if I'll let people read this one.
