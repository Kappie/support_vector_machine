You see, This all started back in.. O.. Let's say April. Around Prom time. Now, for those of you who know me, you know that my parents and I are the coordinators for the Prom that I attended this year. So basically, my life was hectic and yadda yadda. Well, I had trouble finding a prom date cause well... ( I'm a chicken. ) And so I didn't really ask anybody. Well, I asked Aaron, but now that I think about it.. I realized that might have been uncomfortable. Yes, but anyways, I had asked Aaron and was waiting for him to ok with his parents and everything. Whilst I was waiting I was talking to Arturo via AIM and was talking to him about the whole situation. Out of the blue he was like "You know if things don't work out there you could always send me a plane ticket and I'll take you"  Is it possible to choke on your own spit? Because I swore I did just then. I was seriously shocked. Why? Because I did think about asking him. But I didn't think he would go for it. I mean, yea we were awesome friends then and stuff but I still felt kinda weird about the whole idea. Right so anyways on with my story.  Me: Are you serious?  Arturo: Yea. Me: AHH! Me: Why didn't you tell me sooner?! I would have sent the plane ticket agessss ago! Arturo: Are you serious? Me: Yea.  We both decided it was too late for this year, but next year was a definate thing.  It was funny cause, in order to come he would have to stay at my house. Which- is about 366.53 miles away from his. So, naturally we were gonna have to have permission with both of our parents (for obvious reasons, and so forth). I talked to my parents about the situation and they asked me if that was what I wanted and I was like: "Are you kidding?!"  So my parents were cool with it. Actually, I think my mom has been excited ever since I told her. Lol. My mom's a dork.  So the only thing we had to do was get permission from his parents. I was a bit worried since Arty's 8 months younger than me. But he said his parents weren't going to have a problem with him coming. Still... I was worried. I'm a dork. Lol.  My mom  dad sent a letter to his parents stating all the questionary stuff and so we just waited for their response. It took an enormous long time for it to get here. It wasn't his parent's faults though because the mail was running slow or something. Yea. So- I got this today. Or rather, My parents got the letter.  I was getting ready to go somewhere and my mom screamed up the stairs: "Meghan it's here!" And she walked it upstairs so that we could both read it. When she opened it, a check fell out! Lol! It was the money for his prom ticket! Our very first one sold! It was an awesome moment. Then of course we read the letter..   (Arturo I hope ya don't mind this part... I'm not putting the whole letter in here but yeah, this made me feel so awesome that I just had to share it...) The friendship that Meghan shares with Arturo is very sincere in spite of the distance between them. They confide in each other as if they lived on the same block. We would like to let you know that this is the first time we have let Arturo go on a trip by himself. He has never been to a sleep over, but because of the good friendship that he shares with Meghan and because we see that Meghan is such a nice young lady, (for that we congradulate you as parents) we are confident he will be in good hands.  Thank you very much for inviting Arturo to be a part of this special occasion in Meghan's life.  I had to read that about 15 times. I just... I don't know. I felt really super special in that moment. And then "left hand" popped into my head and it kinda disappeared for a minute.  But it came back. I did a happy dance. I couldn't stop smiling. I was like: "omg.. OMG O.M.G! I can't believe Arturo's my prom date!"  It was an awesome feeling. Hehe. Arturo's one of best friends. I'm so stoked about seeing him that weekend. Even if he thinks he's going to get attack by hicks with pitchforks and see millions of acres of cornfields. (Dork.)  I just.. bahhh! I can't stop smiling!
