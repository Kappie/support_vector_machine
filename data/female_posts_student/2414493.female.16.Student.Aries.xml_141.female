I'm just sitting here and I have a whole bunch of stuff around me: math packets, markers, tape, opened letters, a plate for a brownie already consumed. I wish I had Norah playing, but then again I'm too lazy to retrieve it, and it's probably nearing dinnertime.  Everybody knows spring break has to end sometime. I was conscious of the fact, and always, but I didn't prepare myself. On Friday or Saturday I didn't go ok Lydia, this is it, you better get your homework in order, clean up your room, just get ready, etc. So now I'm sitting here, as I've said before, and just cramping and feeling lost. Maybe I'll do the Alamo review tonight. I don't know if we're obligated to finish the Spanish AP work since we were given all the answers.   I just wish I could clean up, maybe. That'd be a healthy start.  Brainache. I can't sit in that math class for two hours and listen to the rules of logic that I learned the summer before ninth grade. Wow, it seems like a long time ago, and it isn't. Test scores are improving, but slightly. I'm sure there's an easier way around some of the problems I do.  School predictions tomorrow: we'll get yelled at by Freeman for not doing the reading. Spanish will just be a pain, but that's nothing new. Math test coming up. Physio coldness, maybe a new chapter? Journalism mayhem, Ballard's super dallying in honor of spring break, Derky hell, as usual.  Making a face.
