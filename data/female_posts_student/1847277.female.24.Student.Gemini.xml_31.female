A cool wind blowing, a storm coming in.  Does that really make me happy?  No.  I can't focus today.  I fell asleep during Yoga.  I don't know if the instructor noticed or not.  You'd think that would be pretty hard, but we did "corpse pose" for 15 minutes, wherein you lie flat on your back and close your eyes and clear your mind.  That's just asking for sleep.    Sometimes I can't tell who my real friends are.  I mean, there are a select few who I know will always be there for me, and vice versa, but there are a lot of people out there who I have really depended upon at one time or another who I can tell couldn't give a shit about me.  And that's such a bad feeling.  Ah well.  I'm trying to be more independent- we'll see how it goes...
