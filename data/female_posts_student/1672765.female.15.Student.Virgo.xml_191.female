My dad and sister are going to this thing at this place. I don't really want to go, I don't really know what it is but I think there are going to be lots of people around and I'm not big on that. Besides, my sister would probably kill me if I went. She doesn't like me very much.  My mom is going to the store today and normally I would go just to get out of the house and maybe look at the CDs though they never have anything I listen to and I would die if they did but I don't really want to go.  So I do have options to relieve my boredom but I'm not taking them so I have no one to blame but myself.    Music: Nothing
