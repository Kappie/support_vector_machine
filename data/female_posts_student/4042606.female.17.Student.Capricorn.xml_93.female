When it is brought to our attention that Mute's mother is going to have the day off tomorrow, making it almost impossible for us to get up in the morning without bringing unwanted eyes. If there is a way to pull it off I would do it in a heart beat, I am actually screwed at the moment because I am at his house right now. My ride won't be here until around 10 tomorrow. So we are just going to enjoy things while they are good, and worry about that little problem that will occur in the morning.
