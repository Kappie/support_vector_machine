       
      I failed my osd assignment.. Misled by my local lecturer, the great Sherman Chin I don't expect to pass my module since the damn assignment is 40%. And my mom has to go around spreading news.. I hate my relatives now.. I hope I don't have to see them again... I don't have to darn well answer to them for god's sake.. I hate gossiping...  I hate life, I hate everything. Darn it
