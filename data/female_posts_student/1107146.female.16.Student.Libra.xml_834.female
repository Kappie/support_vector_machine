This is her night to be treated like a princess and I won't have you screwing it up.  Get the message to Rob and Gossett, that applies to Amber and me too.  Here's what you need to do:  1) Talk to Gossett and Rob about splitting a limo (remember this is April 17), and then book it.  We won't need a stretch probably, just one big enough to hold 6 people.  It needs to be at my house at 5:30.  Make sure the guys know that everyone is coming to my house beforehand, around 4:30 for people's parents to take pictures, etc.  Yall can just leave your cars here and then after prom the limo can bring us back and my mom will have a "midnight breakfast" thing fixed.  The girls will spend the night and the guys will leave about 2:00 or whenever yalls parents want you home.  2) Make reservations at Carrabba's for six people at 6:00.  That will give us about an hour and 45 minutes to eat, so we can leave about 7:45 and have about 20 minutes to get to the factory so we can make a fashionably late entrance (we don't want to be the first ones there).  3) Remember (and remind Rob and Gossett) to order (wrist corsages for everyone is best) corsages at least a week in advance.  You will want to coordinate with your date's dress.  Abby's dress is hot pink, so you'll want to tell the florist that.  They're pretty good about helping you coordinate.  I'll try to get her to give you a swatch of the fabric to give to the florist.    4) Get measured for and order a tux ASAP (like, say, this weekend, since I KNOW you have nothing going on since it was going to be a DI weekend) because otherwise they'll be all gone and you'll be stuck.  Go with something pretty classic and you'll be safe.  Please please PLEASE don't dress really outrageously.  Now is not the time to be funny.  That's a great way to make Abby and her mother mad.    5) Relate all this info to Rob and Gossett.  And get ALL this done SOON.  If you wait any longer, there will be nothing available and then you will be left with three incredibly angry girls on their prom night.  It's not a pretty sight.  So please get everything done in the next week.    6)  If this stuff isn't done by the end of the month, I'm serious Josh, we are getting yall's parents on your case.  And don't print this out because it'll make me look like a real witch.
