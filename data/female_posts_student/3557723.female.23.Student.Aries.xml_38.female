The mail never stops so if I am on the courier route that has the Parcel Post contract, (that is to be read as parcels sent by the average Australian individual/company to another Australian individual/company), work increases at an alarming exponential rate.  Public holidays are worse when they're not national holidays, but state ones. There have been two long weekends in Australia in a row. However, not all Australians enjoyed two lots of three day weekends unless they were jetsetting across the nation.  On Monday, 7th June 2004, it was Foundation Day in Western Australia. It celebrates the founding of our fine state. However not many know this and use this day as an excuse to get drunk or achieve little else. We managed to do the gardening, housecleaning, laundry, shopping, wash the car and bid for Connect-a-Snoopy's on eBay.   I missed the MacDonald's release and didn't know until the last day which coincided with this particular Monday. I won the bid. However, processing of the payment was delayed even though it was done over the internet. Internet banking is not convenient when you still have to wait for a human to process it.  On Monday, 14th June 2004, it was the Queen's Birthday long weekend in the eastern states of Australia. This means a mail delay which means the shipping time of my Connect-a-Snoopy's will be lengthened. But I am assured that they will be reaching me in the very near future.  The $200 we were owed has been paid. Even then, we had to approach the person in order to get the money. It was too much of an effort for them to get off their butt to pay us. Go figure.
