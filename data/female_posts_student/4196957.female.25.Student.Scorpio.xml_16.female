Once upon a time, there was a three headed old man in his cabin. He had three dogs, one for each head. They were called Uno and Mino and Calico. He had a crack through his cabin. Late one night, the old man heard a strange sound. Just as the old man started to run, he reached for a taily-po. A mad wolf came through the door and chased the ma, but the old man lost him. The old man cooked it and ate it and he went to sleep. But he wasn’t asleep very long. He could hear a “Scratch” and the old man said, “What’s that?” Those dogs ran and tore the fence down. That splooter had left those dogs way in the swamp. The old man was by himself and went out and called his dogs. He said, “Heeeah, Heeeah!” The dogs did not come, but the old man threw some snot over at the wolf. So the old man went back to sleep. When he went to his bed, a furry wolf was laying under the covers and he said, “You know, and I know, and I want my taily-po.” The wolf could see him and he got clearer and clearer. The wolf reached out to scratch him in the face, but he old man was too fast. He jumped out of the way. And the old man said, “Hang on a second. I have to use the bathroom. Hang on wolf.” And he jumped in the toilet and flushed himself into the swamp. And he was stuck in the toilet and the wolf could see him and he got closer and closer. And he said, “goodnight” and that thing scratched everything up and the old man went back to sleep. The next morning he chopped the wolf’s head off and made some wolf’s head cheese. Then he said, “I’ll have another wolf come to my house tomorrow. It will be real comfy.”
