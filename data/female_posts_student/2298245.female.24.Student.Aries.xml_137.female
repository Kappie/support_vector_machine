I have a little reading to do, and if I am very very good about it, I can stay away from Queens tomorrow.  Woo hoo!  Then classes start on Monday, which should be depressing, but is somehow a relief to me.  I think it will be nice to get back into my routine.  Oh, yes, and the best news at all....I'm finally getting internet in my apartment.  This means I will be able to spend less time in Queens over the semester.  This should help my mood during the semester.  Last semester the traveling back and forth nearly every day was draining a lot out of me.   Feeling very optimistic today...
