Well, this is quite a change from my  urlLink livejournal  :o) But I figured since my hubby got himself a blog (due to his little brother having one) I figured I'd get one, too.  Today is our 5th wedding anniversary - and we went to McDonald's. He had a QP Burger Combo, and I had a McFlurry (yes, bad me, since I'm not allowed to eat these whilst on Atkins) w/Daim and Caramel in it. But since I am around 8,000 steps after hiking 2 hours with a girlfriend and our dogs around half of Dal√§lven in this 28*C weather, I figured I deserved a nice cold ice cream. :oP""   Happy Anniversary, Sweetie!     That's all for now... ttyl!
