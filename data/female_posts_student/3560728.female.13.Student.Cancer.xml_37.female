OK, so I went up to the cabin on June 29th and stayed until July 2nd or something. I did a lot of writing and thinking and picture taking and canoeing and a lot of other things that one often does in the summmer time. The weather was pretty nice, except for the two hail storms we had, but that is to be expected when you stay in the Cariboo (sp??). I celebrated my birthday and received the new Spitalfield CD, which is really good. If anyone reading this is interested in Jimmy Eat world, and similar sounding bands you will probably take a liking to Spitalfield, as they have the same sort of vibe. Ummm...I've for the most part tried to stop thinking of N.P. I'm way to good for him anyway! LOL! So that's what happened @ big bar lake, but afterwards I visited my friend's cabin, which was really fun despite an infestation of carpenter ants. The architecture in the area is totally insane though! There were houses painted fuschia and turquoise and lime green and stuff, which was very different from the dull greys and whites that are frequently seen in Vancouver. I got to watch a bagpiping concert there too!! It was deffinitely a new type of music for me! The performers even wore the traditional tartan kilts and stuff, which was kind of strange. After watching the concert there's only one thing I should say: the bagpipes are perhaps THE most difficult instrument ever. Just watching them play I was like "Wow..." So that was entertaining, and I am in slightly better shape after walks and hikes and swimming and stuff. So, that has been my life lately. I'll post a couple of songs and poems in a moment....  Bad Dogs and Gentlemen  I burned down your house and watched the flames lick at it I'm not a pyromaniac yet the sense of satisfaction was immense  -Chorus- this is the calm before the storm a chance for us to breathe before we dive right into the tempest  The lightning's your words the thunder my bitter retorts that fades into the night and is forgotten  I'll escape from these flames and slip thru the door like the breath U let out before you told me you didn't mean for it to be like this  -Chorus-  U said, "I never meant to lead U on I never meant to make you believe I felt that way I never meant to deceive U."  too bad you can't change what's already happened (bring an end to this tempest)  -Chorus-  Yeah, nothing ever seems to change... -end-  Creaking Floorboards (giving away secrets.)  The wolf howls as the sun dips ever lower the beauty of this forsaken lake but I'm not sure if this is heaven of if it's hell please deffine what I can't seem to put into words...  I'm powerless as your eyes meet mine but will you be my saviour pull me from destruction or will you push me ever deeper into the flames??  Soon I'll know what it is to have one's life stolen by fire to burn with no release...  I don't know what I'm feeling anyomre I've opened my own wounds ever wider and I wonder why they never seem to heal.  the sun slips away behind the hillsides as the full moon errupts from it's hiding place it spreads it's shallow light over the fields encompassed in a darkness that's otherwise unbroken  I can't seem to hide from you anymore so I cling to whispers of you and these glowing embers that burn out so quickly I'm just asking to be hurt... -end-  Flight 187  The land that lies below me appears as patchwork I'm spinning through the air in a craft I've no reason to trust flight is so unnatural to me...  When tomorrow dawns I'll be miles away from home miles away from reality my past will be unknown I'll meander through crowds, Anonymous.  I'm the secret that everyone's dying to know I'm the one mystery in a world that's been robbed of all it's cryptic secrets  I'm the shadow that hides when it rains I'm the whisper you never should have heard yet will never forget -end-  Fountains of youth  Would you like to buy the world from me?? God knows it's falling into disrepair This empty countryside stretches into forever and there's nothing here that I haven't seen before.  Although the signs claim there's so much to be had here we both know that's a lie all that's left are broken dreams and jaded creatures  -Chorus- Life's for sale won't U buy into this?? Though we said "cross my heart and hope to die we never kept our word and now nothing really maters anymore. (NOTHING REALLY MATTERS)  Heaven spits on us for we've betrayed the angels  Our dreams for lives behind white picket fences have faded away we locked them up somewhere and lost the key...  -chorus-  I've lost the power to slow this down (SLoW THIS DOWN) What happened to the time we had left?? (TIME SLIPS AWAY)  -chorus-  please buy the world from me -end-  Talking backwards  The church parking lot's empty this morning they say the believers never die but did anyone believe all of this??  Chorus And now we're talking backwards not meaning what we say can't you break this silence?? and fix what I have broken  This small town's falling apart I can't reconstruct it because it was never mine  now there's a car parked on your front lawn I thought you'd like to know  -chorus-  we're all to wrapped up in our own problems to bother with yours... (there's a car on your front lawn..) ---roundy thing----  -chorus-
