Where did the time go, and since when have you been like this!? I know I've changed. I know some would think I haven't, and to others I'm a completely different person. I think I've changed just enough. I'm still a kid and by no means think I know more than I do.. Probably underestimate myself a bit too much and its the root of my destruction. But I look back, and things I would have said and done then, and what I'd say and do today. Like the middle of 9th grade. I was the biggest bitch in the world. I mean, I have no excuse -even now, except I was trying to keep it all in, and everything else out, and didn't want to listen to anyone. I was that girl you scream at to the TV because I'm doing the totally wrong things. I was horrible to ken for no reason. I blew it so out of proportion. And some ppl said he wrote about me in his blog. I just want to say thank you for not letting me read it. I would have laughed obdurately, and not thought twice. I know better now, but, still...I know what I was, and who I was. And I'm not too proud. I'm glad I've changed. Yet, now, contradictorily, I've lost myself in the long run. I've been running head first blindly. And suddenly I don't know where the hell I am. I don't know where someone else stops, and I begin. I don't know what I believe- who I believe in anymore. I'm around certain ppl, and I just look at them, knowing that they were so much a part of me before, but know, I don't know whether its me waking up, or what...I don't know. I can't look at anyone, and say that I know them. And it scares me. After all this time, shouldn't I have something to show for it? But I don't. I just have this huge emptiness that use to be filled with bits and pieces of everyone else. And ya- sure, I know there's no escaping ppl influencing you, but I've been sucked in too far into some kind of dream. How am I going to get out of this one? I have to basically start all over again. Except now, I notice, I might have used up all my chances. I've floated away from everyone. I don't know Jennifer Hermann anymore. Haven't had a conversation w. her in a year. Jessica I never see. Ekta has always kind have been that friend of a friend. I don't know her very well. She was my dancing partner at the party. And we've done stuff together- but because she was a friend of a friend. Its weird. Right now, at this point in my life, I have more guy friends than girls. And I'm actually glad. I kind of want it to be that way.well, it makes sense to me at least.  the other day, I was wondering if my brother knows me. Really knows me. He's the person I've been friends w. the longest. But, he's really been gone for the past 4 years. How could he know me? Alyssa has known me since 7th grade. But I haven't been around her for more than a few days in- three years. How can she know me? Alanah might. She probably does. But not a me I want anyone to know. I haven't become a better person in my change. And even around my best friends I feel weird. When I say something, it never feel important, or that they are listening, or that they care. So, I guess it just doesn't matter? Its just not that important. But, everything everyone else says seems relevant to me. It matters to me...   by the way- Steve Tyler's going to be a grandfather... who knocked up Liv?! What did I miss...
