I've never taken any of them before, but I've heard it's a quick and dirty way to get extra hours in.  And they are supposed to be easy.  My Schedule is as follows...  Genetics - MWF at 8am and lab on Tues morning - 4 cred hours Chem 151 - MWF at 10am, recitation at 12 on Mon, and lab at 5:30pm Mon - 5 credit hours!!! Comparative Seminar - MW 1:30-2:45 - 3 cred hours Oranized Crime - Weekend workshop (2 weekends in a row) - 3 cred hours Crime Scene Analysis - 'nother Weekend workshop - 3 cred hours  Im excited for all of them except the chemistry.  At least people I know will be in all of the classes.  That's what I get for being an undergrad for so long.  Last night after dinner, we went for more Ice cream on Mass Street.  This guy ran by us as we were standing outside, and my comment was "I want that."  I think it was my entire family's plan to make me feel badly for not liking bar scenes, but what can I say?  It sort of turned into "you have no social life" attack on me.  Im focused, I can't help it.  I don't think I will meet anyone I will like in a bar, because that's not exactly the best place to meet people, in my view.  Even my dad was making fun of me for not having a date for quite a while.  I could have a date, if I wanted one, that's just not something Im thinking about right now.  I don't really have much time to spend on a boy anyway, so he would probably feel neglected. Anyway, my fam can be pretty catty.  I think it's hard for people to understand that I like school so much.  And they don't understand that Im a little afraid to get into anything serious right now.  Don't really enjoy getting my heart stomped on, so Im trying to do it less and less.  And plus, with the possibility of moving in a year, what's the point any way?
