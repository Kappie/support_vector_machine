And of course I got the new FFT for the Game Boy Advance, so when I'm not working I tend to be playing that.  Or watching Alias.  What a useful existence.  It's another crazy busy weekend, what with having to write a prospectus for my Ancient India paper and working on two new prelim topics.    I'm experiencing some pain getting used to the Mac.  I fought with it for a couple of hours the other day trying to get my printer connected, and then yesterday I got a little fiesty when I was trying to save image files from Noah's CD to my hard drive.  Of course I never did figure it out, so I now have about 320 pictures of people I either don't know or met once (like his gf and his Mutti) saved to disk.  Ah well.    Right.  This entry is even crappier than normal.  Ah well...
