I had the best time and thanks to everyone especially Tiff for making it a great weekend. Now its on to Cali to see Michelle next. Tiff if you find a time that works for you about anything would work for me. Well I will blog a little more later but for right now go to  urlLink this  website and vote for Chuck Altizer. We can't let some little highschool bum beat out a Hokie.
