We just messed around and had fun and laughed and stuff. Drew was mad at me and he wouldnt tell me why. So at the end of the night, we were still at the bowling alley, he told me why he was mad. He talked to Kayla on the phone and the subject of FLA got brought up. Of course it cant be dropped and left alone. Kayla tells Drew that I was "all over" this guy, Jeff, I met in Florida. (I think I wrote about him in a previous post) So of course he is really mad. But the thing is I didnt do that. How can I be  so sure? Because I am afraid of guys. With the exception of Drew, because he is the only guy that I truly trust and I know wouldnt hurt me. (physically at least) So I IMed Kayla and told her I needed to talk to her. (she had an away message on) And this is the conversation: rockalwayz88: hey u needed to talk to me...? IXIrebel2007IXI: yeah... IXIrebel2007IXI: y did u tell drew i was all over that guy? IXIrebel2007IXI: and i would appreciate it if u wouldnt share with him this convo rockalwayz88: well shelby...i was telling my side of the story and that was a part of it IXIrebel2007IXI: but i wasnt "all over him" rockalwayz88: well yes...u were...u grabbed his penis...i think that qualifies for "all over him" IXIrebel2007IXI: what? nooo i did not rockalwayz88: whatever gets you to sleep at night IXIrebel2007IXI: when did i do that? rockalwayz88: after i left and then came back to talk to you and you and whatever his name was invited me in... IXIrebel2007IXI: i didnt do that. b/c i have learned my lesson about guys rockalwayz88: well you know what...i really really dont want to fight with you...i told my side of the story justl ike you told yours...and i dont think i was hallucinating when i saw that...but again, whatever you gotta tell yourself to get through the day IXIrebel2007IXI: havent u ruined enough in my family? guess it wasnt enough... u had to ruin me and drew with something that didnt even happen. so i thank you for that rockalwayz88: yes shelby...i am a life-ruiner, i get paid $30 an hour for it...so your welcome, just doing my job IXIrebel2007IXI: well u really good at it rockalwayz88: shelby...i dont want to fight...your vision is tainted and you have a warped sense of reality right now...i think you need to get some sleep IXIrebel2007IXI: tainted sense of reality? riiiight... u r the one who needs desperate pshycological help.  IXIrebel2007IXI: im threw with this So, Im the bad guy here. And she has drew to believe her and he wont talk to me. Thanks alot. Some friend. I dont think I have ever been so upset. I cried for what seemed like days. My mom came over, ans she is very mad about the situation. So is my grandmother, who supposedly acts like a 5 year old according to Kayla's psycho cousin, Brittany. Thats a whole nother story to be posted at a whole nother time. Then this morning, when I went to bed at 3, I got up at 7:30 and went over to Lauren's house. Then we got picked up by Mrs. Terri and went to clean their house. That was fun. Then she drove us back (us as in 9 people in her excursion... Terri, Loribeth, Devin, Lauren, Chelsea, Dalton, Me, and Jordan) to Lauren's house. Then I came home, went to sleep and here I am. Im back into depression again. Thats pretty much it...
