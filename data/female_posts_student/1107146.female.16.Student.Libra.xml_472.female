Think of the wowifical nombre of posts all the BLogs have been getting lately...HMM. I wonder why.  Man, I was reading the archives to all the BLogs the other day...what nostalgia. Good times, friends, good times.  So I'm sitting here and I'm really hot, because I cut the grass a second ago. And with me, I took a portable listening device called a CD PLAYER, and took the wonderful band LINKIN PARK with me. It was great, I haven't listened to  Hybrid Theory  in a long time. But anyway...I was listening to  With You  and I decided...I need to learn every instrument possible. I was listening to the turntables thinking, "Damn, it would be awesome to blingity bling on 45s," and all the sudden I was stricken with a fervor of, "Hoo-ah!" So's this should be fun. I really want to play a harmonica, but the piano would be nice, and I've been threatening violin for a long time. So we'll see.  But I have to start scratching soon...more about practice than learning, 'tis. Just to be proficient in every field possible. w00t.  Nonagons and nuptuals, friends.
