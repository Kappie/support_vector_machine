Anyways then the family went to this good nice family restaurent called L'acamdemie and our waiter was really cute. Then we game home and then Julia and I "studied" for a while mom and dad were grocery shopping. Oh what fun then I tasted a martini which suck. Its true taryn and then I had a shower then got majorly sprayed by Julia and then I played cards with my grandma and then had a whole bunch of vegetables and then finally here I am typing my new blogger. And on the phone with my best friend Taryn who just moved and has bathroom for herselve. Sooo not fair. And I had a dance recital yesterday and it was cool. I did pretty good. Man I hate Mary-Jane and Dominque. Dominque had this dress and she was being soo snobish and it looked soo bad on her cuz she has no tits and has a belly. I laughed. Go me being mean and evil. I will write later.*Kisses  Hugs *
