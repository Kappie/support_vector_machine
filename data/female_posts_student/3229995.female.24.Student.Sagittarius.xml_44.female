This film made me laugh AND feel embarrassed on their behalf. How could he go from making Snatch and Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels to...this? Was he trying to be funny? Was it all a joke? One thing I'm sure of, is that Madonna had more than a little to with it. As usual she is playing basically herself. The best bits are when she dances around with a fish, a rabbit, some fruit and a motorbike. Once the couple in love appear to ascend above the palm trees and fly horizontally across the sunset...    THE PLOT 3 filthy rich couples on a cruise in the Mediterranean. Amber is the spoiled and nasty wife of a drug baron ("he's in chemicals"...) who treats Beppe (an Italian crew member) really bad on board the ship. She orders him around, treating him like a slave. Then guess what happens? The two of them get stuck on a deserted island, and here the roles are reversed... The Italian fisherman can catch fish with his hands and Amber obviously can't, so she becomes his slave! Among the things she has to do for him is sing and dance and call him Master...and after a while they fall in love (of course..?)   Let's build a home. Right here! The former rich bitch turned nature child Amber does not want to leave her Italian stallion or their Island. But he wants to test if she can love him in "the real world", so they go back to civilisation...and Amber decides to stay with her husband! The moral is: Stay with the guy who's got the money!   WHO WROTE THIS DIALOGUE?  The captain tells Amber that Foking is the name of a fish in Italian: "Well I don't care if it's foking, puking or a fxxxing kung-fu king, I want that fish and I want it tonight!" Amber tells Beppe she loves him: "But if you hadn't been shipwrecked, you would still be a rich and happy American wife, and I would still be a poor, Italian, happy fisherman."
