And I wake up before my alarm (6ish). That means something like maybe 5 hrs. of sleep. Ugh. I don't know whether its excitedness or worry that's making me have such problems. Maybe it's the fact that school is coming up. I'm going to get some textbooks tomorrow, if my loans have been deposited yet. Then Im going to be debt free! Well, other than student loans. YAY! I can't remember the last time I had no credit card bill to pay. It's amazing the weight that's lifting off of me.  I don't really have much to say tonight. My work schedule is wearing on me a little this week. I'm going to have about a 40hr work week, when I normally have about a 20hr. work week. And that's not including my working on my internship paper or doing research/office work for Dr. M. Little tired. And all the crappy people I have to deal with at work (ie. the unwashed masses).  I think I have to speak at this orientation thing on Thurs. I'm not so good with the public speaking, although after last semester when I had something like 8 presentations to give, you'd think I'd be stellar. Not so. I get so nervous in front of groups. Im better one-on-one.  I'm a little worried about my research group with Dr. M. I didn't get on so well with some of the people that worked with us last semester. One girl, Laura, I think is the sweetest person I have met for quite a while, and we get along pretty well. Blaine probably despises me because I ditched him as a research buddy for our school research forum after he left me to do all the work on a project for the regional psych conference. I wasn't too happy about that. And he couldn't understand why I was upset with him. Kelly... I don't know about her. I had a running joke with one of my buddies that she was my girlfriend. I don't remember how it started, but Megan said she tends to hang on my every word. That kinda stopped. She said something to a friend of mine that hippo observations drove us apart, but it was more that when I needed a friend, she couldn't be there for me. I had a rough time dealing with how awful my mother is actually doing last semester, and one day when I was talking to her about it, she rolled her eyes at me. Like I wasn't...giving her a chance to get a word in edgewise or something. Or like she didn't think I was upset. All she ever said to me when I discussed anything was, "I don't know what I would do without my mom."  Yeah. I didn't like not having one either, while growing up, and what really started to bother me was the feeling that I will never get the chance for a normal relationship with her. I have been pushed into a mothering role with her, and it makes me angry because that is her job. Or was. But she's never done it. Not since I was maybe 7. It terrifies me that I will never actually know my mother. I know my dad. Well. He shares just about everything with me. Anymore, I don't know what's real and what's not with my mom. I don't know if she's telling the truth or making things up, and I don't trust her. That is what makes me most sad about how things are now. The good news is, I don't think about it much. My sisters have started thinking about it more, and have become more involved, which is good.  Yuch. Sorry. I'm getting a little too introspective with this thing. I need more ren  stimpy type comedy to liven things up...  For a boy update: I have no luck. I need to move out of this dead, dead town.  Soon (tattoo boy doesn't even visit me much at work anymore, and zoo boy has been busy).  I have cute shoes.  Tell me Im not the whole package?
