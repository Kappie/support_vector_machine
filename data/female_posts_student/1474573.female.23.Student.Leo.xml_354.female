I feel bad, because according to my site meter, I get about 25 visitors a day. Which means 25 people are looking forward to reading about my life. I feel so honored, really...      So sorry, guys. But now here's a recap of the weekend. It's kinda like VH1's Best Week Ever. I give you the highlights of the weekend without all the boring stuff.      Friday Steve grilled Steak and we ate that with french fries. It was yummy. Oh wait, that's kinda boring, isnt it...      Okay so Saturday Steve went to play golf while I waited for the cable guy to come and hook up basic cable in the bedroom upstairs. I would have done it when we hooked up the other tvs, but we had this terribly old television upstairs so there was no point. On the July 4th weekend, Sears had a sale on everything and I got us a new tv for like $75.00. So now with the new tv comes more options and therefore we just HAD to get the cable up there. And besides, it was only a $9.95 installation fee. But wait, it gets better! The cable guy was supposed to come between 11am and 1pm. He was about 20 minutes late. Because he was late, I got the installation for free! YAY! Hey, I'll take what I can get, man!       I got so excited about the cable upstairs that I weeded the front garden. Yes, I know you  think  it's unrelated, butwatch this...See, the fact that I had to actually get out of my pjs on a Saturday morning and look decent for the cable guy compelled me to actually leave the living room (y'know, since I was dressed an' all.) SoI went outside on the porch andwas reminded of the weeds since the clover was taking over so much you couldnt see the begonias... It was about timeI took care of it, so I did. Ah-HA! See how its all related? At least in  my  head it is. hmmph.      Moving right along. Steve had gotten me tickets to see Alanis Morissetteand Barenaked Ladies at the PNC Bank Arts Center for my graduation and Saturday night was the concert. He also got me her new album which I wasnt impressed with but I didn't have the heart to tell him until I played it for him and about half way through he says, "Can we shut this shit off?" HAHAHA! You gotta love this guy! So basically we were really hoping that BNL would go on first which they did. They were really awesome! Such fun, I tell ya. Always look like they're having a blast on stage. I'm also in love with   urlLink  Ed Robertson   . mmmm-mmm.        Aside: Steve and I have this thing: if we had the possibility of having sex with a famous person, we'd forgive each other. It's only right since the opportunities dont come around that often, right? Right. So John Cusack was at the top of my list but now I think I've replaced him with Chad and Ed. John is still in the top three. You'll have to ask him who's on his list... I know Halle Berry is probably #1, but I dont know about the rest. It's cool though. I think he's got good taste. ;-)       But I digress. BNL rocked out and then Alanis came on. YAWWN. I mean, she sounded pretty good, but she was so boring. Just standing at themicrophone singing her songs. Saying the obligatory, "Thank you New Jersey!" once in awhile...but overall? Eh. So after "You Oughta Know" and giggling at the 40-something, bald, probably drunk, fat guypumping his hands in the air and screaming out the song, we left. (So what do you think his favorite line in the song is?  'It was a slap in the face/how quickly I was replaced/and are you thinking of me when you fuck her?'  hehe)        Another aside: According to I Love the 90's on VH1 (yeah I watch a lot of VH1...AND?!), and a friend of mine confirmed it, that song was written after Dave Coulier broke her heart. The guy from Full House that can make the Bullwinkle voice. For some reason a passionate relationship with that guy is just kinda hard to picture...and its also kinda gross...         So anyway, moving right along. Us Northern East Coast dwellers had a lot of rain on Sunday. And I have cable in the bedroom so guess who didn't get up that early yesterday? Thats right, children. Me. I was in my pjs all day and it felt pretty darn good. Get this. I showered and then put other pjs on. I was going for the long haul. Wrastled up some grub and plopped on the couch for some quality time with Steve and Showtime On Demand.    Since we haven't had Showtime all this time, I thought I'd catch up with   urlLink  The L Word   . Its all about gorgeous lesbians in LA and their gorgeous friends. So Steve was into it. (snicker!) We got sucked into it and watched like, 4 episodes in a row. Then we ate some more. Then we watched some more tv. Then we ate some more. Somewhere in there I did the laundry and made a few phone calls and even IMed a little. Then we went to bed where I proceeded to watch more television. Then I fell asleep and dreamt about gorgeous lesbians.Just ABOUT THEMon their own... Not with me, youperverts... Like I was still watching episodes and predicting how it would all come out...      And lastly the piece de resistance! I found my friend Rose. YAY! Her birthday was yesterday and I ALWAYS call her for her birthday. We've been friends since we were 9. But we kinda went our separate ways and keep finding each other along the way... its cool. She's one of those people that no matter how much time passes you can talk like it was just yesterday. I love huh. So anyway, I tried calling her cell and it was disconnected. So was her phone! So luckily her mother stillhas the same number since we were 9, and I called her. She told me Rosie moved to Miami and gave me the number. AWW. She was all like, "AWW, YOU ALWAYS CALL ME!!!" We talked for an hour. Love huh!! Y'know I dont mind losing people that didn't mean much, but when there's a connection there, you always gotta find a way to hook up and keep them in your life in some way or another.      So there you have it folks, the weekend. It's funny how I feel like I really didn't do much at all, and yet I can blab about it this much. hee hee!
