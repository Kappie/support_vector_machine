I had SO much fun over the last month, but it was SUPER hard.....ask jess....she looked at how many notes we took a day.  We had class 3 times a day....this is what our schedule was like just about every day!  wake up 7-8:30- Breakfast 8:30- Class 11- whenever Lunch 1:30- Class Again 5- Dinner 6:30-class we usually got out around 9 or shortly there after, then we had to be in the dorms by 10 and in our rooms by 11 for the first week, then we all started falling asleep in class and so we had to be in our rooms by 10....that sucked!! oh well.....It was still a lot of fun!! If you wanna know more...just ask! Ill fill you in...if you wanna see pictures, I can give you some....I've missed yall! Leave a comment
