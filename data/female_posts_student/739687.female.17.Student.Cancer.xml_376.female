Someone is messing around in my trunk, and now I don't know if that bottle was spilled or is someone messed with it. I think my dad might know. Now you're wondering why he wouldn't say something to me? It's simple. He'll probably hide it from my mom until some day when I piss him off and he brings it all out. Now honestly...yes, that will suck. But let's not forget that I know things that could be revealed at such a time. Because the only way to win with parents is to invalidate their authority. Cha-ching. If you're lost...then it's all for the better. :)  So I'm not really too worried.  So last night also sucked because I was crawling out of my window in my room (please don't ask...) and my belly button ring got caught on the brick and it kinda stretched it and it started bleeding pretty hardcore. :( painful.  Okay time to go. fear me crazies.
