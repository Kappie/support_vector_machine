The only part of this which actually seems newsworthy to me is that he claims to have smoked it "by accident" ... which of course has a faint whiff of Bill Clinton's wink-wink "didn't inhale" scandal in the early 90s.    The only thing which could make this better is if McCartney tried to claim that he SHOT heroin by accident, but I guess you can't have everything.
