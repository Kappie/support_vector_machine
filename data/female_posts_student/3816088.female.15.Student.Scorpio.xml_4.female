I did like my usual walk around my neighborhood where like I go behind it and then all the way to the front but some of the like scariest but funniest things happened. First I start walking in the back like bike trail or whatever they call it and back there everyone has to have those roughtiron fences so you can see through them and i guess it was potty time for all the dogs because EVERY house I walked by back there I heard like clinking of the chains and then like the dogs would bark like cRaZy!! Now im used to being barked at by the "construction workers" but by the dogs?!? jkjk it was pretty scary.  And then I walked a little bit farther like close to the railroad tracks and there are bigger trees back there and all the sudden this swarm of birds come swopping down and like look like they are about to bonbard me! It was like this is like the movie!! But it turns out they only wanted whatever was in that tree.....THANK GOD!  So i continued to walk the neighborhood and I finally got out of the back part so i didnt have to deal with anymore nonsense...at least i thought! So i walk to the very fornt neighborhood thingy thats like seperated from my neighborhood but connected? its weird but yea its like in this circle thingy so i walked around there and i thought it was just me and all the sudden i look up and there is this old lady knitting on a rocking chair and i jumped like 5 feet! i was TERRIFIED!! Then she was like "How are you doing today sweetie pie" and i wanted to say something like "just dandy you old scary scary women!" but instead i just said in my sweet voice (once i caught my breath of course) "really good thanks and yourself" but inside i was soo upset! man you think i am bad when you tickle me....no just try scarying me! aHhHhH! So yea then I figured it is definatly time to go back because this is getting out of control! So i start back tracking and head back the same way I came and the "barking construction workers" drove by in their truck and like waved and I was like "ok its not like this hasnt happened before im ok just keep walking, walking, walking" so i keep walking and then i hear  ::beep beep beep::  yes thats right THEY BACKED UP!!! i started picking it up a bit then. I dont mean like speed walking or walking a little faster I mean like in a jog! but then it turns out they were backing into a lot lol I felt kinda stupid but OMG!! it was soo scary.  So yea I HURRIED home!! I know I walk really fast sometimes but this topped all of those times by like 10! And when I got inside those doors I had NEVER been so happy to get home in my life!!
