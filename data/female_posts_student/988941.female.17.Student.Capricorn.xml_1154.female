Talk about what you wish and things. Most Mondays / Sundays someone posts a subject to discuss all week. There are a few basic rules which are: a) no blatant or however it is spelt promo for a website (cough david t cough) and b) no excessive swearing unless your in an incredibly evil / mad / depressed mood. Fair? I think so.  Well the ball last night was fab. Jackie, Matt and Max, you sooooo should've come! It wasn't really valentines influenced at all in fact it was just like the leavers ball except it was on a boat and there wasn't as much food. But it was soo good. I got Dean to buy me a drink, go me. It was so fun. Paul looked so loverly :) Everyone looked so loverly. I went to bluewater today with Lisa and my rents. I got some new shoes! And a few other things so it was a sucessful day in all.   Right now I am going to go and collaspe onto my bed after I have tided the chaos that is my room as it is in mayhem from getting ready yesterday. Rah.
