All I talked about was the..."wonders"...of the blood bomb, and how much I've learned about the absorbancy of feminine care products this year. I hate me a honeybunch.  I'm getting sick, I think. And it sucks. And to top it off, Abby was sick yesterday, and that is not cool. And then, Alex left early, and Linds didn't even show. It was a fucking great day, all cloudy and whatnot. It kept everyone pretty somber during Algebra, tho. I think they were listening to the rain and thinking, "Heymaybemetrogotoutthatwouldbecool." Spinks even came up to me and flat out said they'd look online and found out that Metro got out.  People...come on! Metro doesn't get out for shit, and never has! Especially for one day of off and on rain with little squalls here and there. Just because they don't have the greatest attendance record doesn't mean they aren't strict about telling peeps to come to school. Everyone knows Williamson County is the only one that lets out because the clouds "were dark" and "I think it's supposed to be cold tonite...that could be an indicator of snow in the near-future".  A lot of people=dumb to the fifth.
