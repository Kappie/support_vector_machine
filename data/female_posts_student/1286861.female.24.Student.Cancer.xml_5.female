Being sick has led to nothing but an unhealthy amount of time with nothing to do but lie on a broken back and think. So I thought and thought and thought. For me, thinking in the first place can lead to disaster. But I think I did a fairly good job at keeping the casualties down to a minimum this time around. I made the initial mistake of thinking about certain individuals that I really shouldn�t think about anymore. I started feeling sorry for myself, sick at the life I was living, and wishing to go back in time and make things as they once were. I was on this train of thought for a while, and then I realized�no wonder people say I needed to start this site. I have so much crap in this head of mine that I need to forget and let go. Why has it taken me so long to discover this? And may I please state for the record this discovery came without any outside aid of prescription drugs or otherwise!  There are certain things that I wish to bring up with these select individuals, but I feel this is not the correct forum to do so in. I just want to express the relief and joy I feel at this time. I am taking the power away from �the people� as a public mass to make me happy or unhappy. That is really the end of it.  I will also tack onto the end how completely upset I am that I am almost 23 years of age and have yet to be even remotely swept off my feet. I am bitter about this on many levels.  Woo. Okay. See, I promised it would be just a second!!
