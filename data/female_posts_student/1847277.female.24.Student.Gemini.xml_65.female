Of course, I tend to be anti-music stealing, so thus far it just has various songs from all my CDs (mostly alternative type stuff from the mid-90s) and some of Matt's.  I am definitely one of those people who associates music with particular moments/times in my life, and the music I have constantly makes me think about sophomore-junior year of high school.  Not always a good thing.    Blagh.  Not in the mood to blog.
