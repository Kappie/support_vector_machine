I don't have a choice in the matter.  I spent most of yesterday at my friend's Doug and Suzanne's house. I had a lot of fun, and I was glad I was able to sit back and relax for a little while. I have been busy working on my story and looking at options for self-publishing.   So, for now, I'll leave it at that. I would like to try and talk to my old friend again. Hopfully he won't put up a wall with me again.   And, be sure tp check out the President's Website!http://www.georgewbush.com  "Michael Moore, one of these days, will be shot...And I'll laugh!" - Bebe Renolds  Ambershai
