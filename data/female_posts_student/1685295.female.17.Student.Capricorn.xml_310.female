Yeah, well I might not even show up for our first day back, really don't feel like it, or come back to just face more failure, not that it even bothers me anymore. Its just the look of disappoitment that does. Oh well. Yeah, I got my pictures back today too, wel...technically yesterday. I look horrible in all of 'em, just as expected. I did manage to pick one out of the horrors, and I plan to burn the rest.   College guys? What've you people been up to?     Iggy  the Trolls - Whatever  I'm sittin' like a stone On a solitary evening Without my girl life has no meaning She didn't say why And she didn't say what for she just said "I've been thinking it over" And whatever, Whatever Whatever She doesn't want to play And her voice just fades away Whatever  The solution to love I haven't found yet Does God have curlers and a hairnet Everything I say comes out To be a no no The feelings I had were the Only promo Whatever (x3) She doesn't want to play And her voice just fades away Whatever  Now I'm just one of the Joes On the corner I guess I ought to stay home And watch the porno I wanna get close But no one Will let me I wish someone would reach out and get me Whatever (x3) She doesn't want to play And her voice just fades She doesn't want to play And her face just fades She doesn't want to play And her touch just fades away  Whatever (x3)  (x2) She doesn't want to play And her voice just fades away Whatever (x3)  She doesn't want to play And her voice just fades away    There's not much left, I'm starting too see, maybe nothing at all for much longer. But there is something out there, and I kinda wanna see it, no matter what it takes. It'll just tear me apart to do so though, since I'll haveta leave what I do have behind, but that'll probably just have to be something else I'll get have to used to when the time comes. And when it does, I'll have to say "I appreciate it"  I'm Deadinside, and dead outside.  "Hey there world, here I come"
