Then I doodled a little pic of Zakuro (from tokyo mew mew) and it turned out great! grr. lol Oh welllll.     I might play on the playstation or something now. Oooooooo its 2:15. I think I'll get some lunch :9    Looooove Zen    (this is the pic I drew, although whenI scanned it, it made it smaller lmao)
