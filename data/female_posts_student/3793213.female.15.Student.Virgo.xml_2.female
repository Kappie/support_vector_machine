Well, we dwelled on the past, seeing as I haven't seen him in a year, about us dating in the eigth grade, and about how our goodbye ended up unlocking feelings neither of us were ready for. It is really quite sad because we've liked each other a year, but haven't had the chance to act on it. I want to, I don't know why, but I really want to just have one more chance...things were cut off so short! But anyways... I talked to him until midnight last night and we reminessed and just talked for a very long time. I usually can't hold a conversation that long, but it was easy to talk to him and even though people say things to me, I know what he is really like and I don't take any heed to what I hear. I wish my friends knew him, understood how I feel. And oh good, I just wrote half a blog with the intelligence of an eight grade girl...moving on. I have to go to work today at Dairy Queen, land of soft serve and fat people who order massive icecreams. I don't mind it though, I enjoy working there. But since father dearest is off at an onsite I have to walk there today, not fun. I thought about doing some homework today, but no. Too much homework, no patience. I really ought to start my next essay, even though my first one isn't very good, and I'm very dissapointed in myself for the simple fact that I'm inept at creative writing. I have to question what I'm doing in AP classes, I don't feel as intelligent as everyone else, I feel a little underqualified but I suppose I'll just have to make myself blend.  Well, this whole post, again like the last, was pretty pointless but I really had to spit it all out, so I don't explode, like a spontaneous conbustion type of deal.  Auvoir mon amies! A demain,  Kayle
