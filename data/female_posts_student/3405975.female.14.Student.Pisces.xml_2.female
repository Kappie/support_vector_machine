OH MY GOD, I did not even know why I was such in a depressed mood... Felt like crying but cannot cry, and in less then 3 minutes later, tears came to my eyes... >. don't like  crying infront of other people, including my good friends! I think that it feels weird. Hey, maybe I'm a loner 'cause I prefer to cry by myself! Haha... Well, enough about depressed moods and crying, let's turn back time and go back to the morning, at 7am! Woke up at 6am...on a Sunday morning!!! Helloooooo...Rarely do people do that?! Guess I'm special. =P Anyway, upon reaching school, realised that there was only Fion, Jasmine and me. *Looks out and thinks ' Why did all the people go?? '* Anyway, most of the other people arrived at 7:30am and 8am plus... Helped out with last minute preparation and   voila  !   It was time for the carnival to start!  Ding ding ! Wow, there was sooo many people and quite a lot came to our "Dart 'em all" stall! Basically, just throwing darts at balloons. Hmmm... Honestly, I like the haunted house the best. It's so kool and scary!!! And the doorman did not help make things better by saying that the band room(the place where the haunted house is) is haunted!!!!!!!! I was standing in front of my group somemore... We went in in groups of threes. Fion, Hui Shin and Liying. MIng, Karen and me. Yiting, YingLi and Jas. You know what, odd numbers are unlucky numbers! =P Saw lots of "ghosts"! SOme hands touched my legs too! Maybe I should sue them for molest! Haha... Then there was this scene where a girl sat infront of a mirror and old chinese music was playing in the background!! *shivers* Heck, I'm gonna suffer from a heart attack!!! And Ming's hand was holding mine so tightly!! But, it's all right 'cause she's mi wifey! There was this spot where someone jumped infront of us! That was when we all screamed together! *pants pants* Kool! I want to go again! ^^ Anyway, went on to shoot small basketballs into the hoop/basket thingie. Got 3 tries, but only one got in and it was by luck too!! -.- I really,   really   wanted the red soft toy that was like a gigantic, oversized mouse. I think it was a cartoon character. And right now, I'm recalling the scene where I saw a girl hugging a lot of soft toys (or maybe there was a few big ones, making it seem a lot). A guy, I bet is her boyfriend, placed his hands on her waist!!! Awww...so sweet. I bet he won those soft toys for her, 'cause he's sweating and everything. *Envy* I want a boyfriend too!!!! Hahaha...I'm hopeless. I scare guys away, man! *Victory sign* ^^ Anyway, I caught some fishies in long kang fishing!!! Erm...Not me who caught it... I failed to catch any within the 35s time limit. The people in charge caught 4 for me! So good!!! Haha, and the fishies (plus 5 more which I bought in the market today) are swimming in the fish tank in my living room! So cuteZ! Anyway, left school at 5:15 for West Mall. That was when they were playing Qing Tian... And maybe, it was because of Chicky that I cried... Hah! Impossible! *denys, denys and  keep denying!* Anyway, Liying bought one very nice red wasit pouch!! Converse!! It was so cheap! $9.90 only! Lucky, yesterday was the last day of the sale... Liying predicted it correctly! *ding ding* Anyway, that was basically yesterday's events. Hmm...  Ast  -If love can be counted into stars, I bet the universe is not big enough to contain my love for you. -
