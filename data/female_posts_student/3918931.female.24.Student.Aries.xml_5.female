Then, instantlythere is that horrible buzzing near your ear.  The plan for tonight is to kayak out under a bridge near here on the Santee river.  We will set light traps in order to catch larval crabs.  If we get enough, I will be able to finally start my vertical migration project.  I was hired for 10 weeks this summer, but my project only takes about 5 days once its started.  The picture is a rental car that Steve (the PhD dude) got while his Civic is in the shop.  Its a Chrysler Pacifica and they start at about $30,000.  If only that company knew what we were doing in their nice luxury SUV/VAN.  Ta well!  urlLink
