Borrowing Neitzche’s polemic on Wagner let me say my criticism for Love should in no way be mistaken as praise for anyone else in music.  Love is still head and shoulders above 95% of her industry.  I’ll be honest and admit that you’re “seething hatred” bothers me, not because I require universal praise for love, but you spew such contempt without being familiar with her work.  The “I hate Courtney Love” fan club is large, I’m probably in the minority- someone who not only appreciates her works but acknowledges the fact publicly, -but the club seems to hate the woman, not her work.  Courtney Love has released four albums, I wonder how much of that work the club has heard, yourself included.  I bet not much.  Courtney Love is an artist.  She’s angry, unpredictable, funny, sad and yes a bit mad.  But she also forces us to look ourselves, to re-examine and re-evaluate what exactly is art.  I’m with you, look at the art for what it is.  You’d have to wretch my copy of  Pirates of the Caribbean  from my cold, dead hands, but movies, music, magazines and popular culture can’t be strict entertainment.  Yes we need to be entertained and transported from our everyday lives, but popular culture also needs to move us, make us think, put into words that which we feel and recognize and illuminate what is both good and bad in ourselves.  Though I agree creativity as a whole is lacking, I don’t share your pessimism.  To borrow a worn out cliché- the glass may be half-empty (or more so), but what we have is so rich, so vibrant, I’m o.k.
