The who's who:   Stella: Kim's mom;  Nancy: My mom;  Kim: My wife;  Jessica: Our daughter; and  Alyssa: Our Granddaughter.   Flash failed on the two darker pics - I fixed 'em up as much as I could.  We were at the Macaroni Grill, Nancy (in from Kalamazoo) was treating.   Alyssa's a real handful - started walking this week, constant ball of energy, always getting into everything.  Wow.   Let me know if the links don't work!   Daf
