If you thought you managed to get off doing the R.E thing - think again, she said we could do it next week, but we have scary visitors coming in so we might have to do it infront of them! :S Oh yeah, i put you in the larries group, which has a whole 2 people in in! (you and alex) I'll just read your blog about final fantasy and pretend to understand who you're talking about. Hey, do we have a guestbook on here?  Do you think anyone reading this knows what we're talking about? Do you think Phil is going to find out that Mark's not the dad? Do you think i even know what i'm talking about? Hey, did you see Eastenders last night? I missed it. Yet another of hassall's friends have added me - and they're talking to me and they're in the middle of a lesson at school, and we have an inservice day! Woooooo!
