Even tho it's two walls (I'm doing half my room dark purple and the other half yellow.. perhaps I shall share pictures once completed..? *sceam* (sp...?)). But she had to complete the bathroom and today was busy feeling for some reason. I wasn't really at home at all and this is the first time today I have been on the computer *feels strange* o_O.  Anyways... I was cleaning out all the crap in my email account and I came across this pic:     Dear god.. I must have laughed for 5 minutes straight... XD (yes my life is just that uneventful..) Well, I'm gunna go back to my pathetic little flash movie creativness and try to figure out how to use a button to start the movie... A mistery to us all... Or maybe only me -_-
