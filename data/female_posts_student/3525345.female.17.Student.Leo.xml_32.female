This meant we had to arrange an alternative at very short notice.  So we could get them up and running again as quickly as possible, those worlds have now been moved to one of our other existing providers.  Their new home is 'nlayer'. We already had a few worlds there and were very happy with their reliability/performance, so in fact the relocated worlds should hopefully run faster than ever at their new location.  All the worlds should now be functioning normally again.  *Taken from  urlLink www.runescape.com
