I thought he said to meet him here,  But I'm not sure. I've got the money  If you've got the time. He said, "It feels good." I said "I'll give it a try."  I want a lover I don't have to love, I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk. Where's the kid with the chemicals? I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full. I need some meaning I can memorize. The kind I have always seems to slip my mind.
