The computer told me that it didn't post at all.....argh. Your new quote? Homines libenter quod volunt credunt. Have fun. Make sure to give me an author if there's one. (Which by the way, if you don't give me an author, you get 150 points instead of 160. If there's no author, I just give you the full 160.) Points: Alison: 900 Michael: 520 Nathan:510 Sarah and Marten: 470 Olivia: 460 Jonah:320 Evan: 160 It's been really quiet here. I should be doing my summer reading, but I'm not. I'm getting too lazy for my own good. I know though that I am not going to have all that much time next year, and so I'm enjoying not doing anything. Ah well.  I'm gonna go upstairs and read. yay...  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"
