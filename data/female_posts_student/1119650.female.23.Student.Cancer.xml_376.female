Be sure and click all of the links, because no 2 links are the same, and some of them are pictures from our trip while others are awesome links!  I hope you make it to the end, good luck and Godspeed!**  God, where do I even start trying to recap this weekend?!?  I know I'm gonna leave a kajillion things out, but here goes:   Friday  Anna, Missy and I arrive in Boston in the early afternoon and we're greeted by a cutie with the Bah-ston accent who wants to "pahk our cah".  Check in and check out the  urlLink room.   Real plates and glasses, silverware, a fridge, heated floors everything was brand new, free highspeed internet access, alright, we were kinda pimpin'.  We were starving so we wandered around the Charlestown 'hood, but we some how ended up in the  urlLink ghetto , so we called for a cab and decided not to wait on the corner 'cause we'd look like some hookers.  The cabbie picks us up and takes us to  urlLink Newbury Street  for some  K I L L E R  shopping.  We had a quick lunch and realized in Boston that they don't talk about the penis so much as they talk about the "CAHCK" (those wacky Massholes!)  Anyhow we hit up  urlLink the shops at the Prudential Center  and spent WAY too much money in  urlLink Sephora (you devil store, you!) .  Back to the room for some time primp and get ready to go out.     urlLink We got all gussied up to go out and pimp it with some of the local boys.   We asked the valet guys in the lobby where we should go and they suggested a delightful little spot which I now hold dear to my heart, called  urlLink The Rack .  We were all a little skeptical on it, but it turned out to be a veritable martini Mecca!  At the Rack we enjoyed a myriad of delightful new 'tinis like the trusted old favorite  urlLink the Apple Martini.   This one, however, had a new twist, it was served in a glass rimmed with green sugar, and garnished with a cherry, candy apple slice and a little jungle animal toy.  There were also some new yummy martinis like the  urlLink watermelon martini  and the  urlLink blue raspberry martini.   Tres yum!  Needless to say the drinks kinda snuck up on us and we started chatting up  urlLink the guys next to us  and found out that one of them,  urlLink "Awesome" Andy , is a super big fan of local New York radio superstar,  urlLink Sheeplover .  Being that we have the pleasure of knowing him by his real identity,  urlLink Don Labia  we got to score some extra points with Andy and  urlLink his boys.   We got drunker and decided to call it a night and when we got back to the hotel there was much running through the halls, pleading with the front desk guy to let us swim and ordering pizza to be had.     Saturday  We were a little hung over Saturday morning, and poor  urlLink Missy  was feeling sickies, but we decided to head out to the  urlLink New England Aquarium  where we got our picture taken with Sammy the Seal (that pic will come later, 'cause its on "real film"), we saw some penguins and got a little annoyed with all the little bitchy kids in there, so we hightailed it on out.  Oh, I almost forgot:  this is a big fuck you to  urlLink Digital City  because every single time we looked something up on there we found out it had gone out of business like 2 years previously, like our sushi place where you sit on the floor and are all cool or our psychic or any of the other bum directions you fucks gave us!  But I digress, we did some MORE shopping at  urlLink Faneuil Hall  (apparently its pronounced Fan-yull).  We waited in the room and napped and what not until the lovely  urlLink Lisa  arrived.    Then we got all gussied up again and headed out for dinner.  We came across a place called  urlLink The Rock Bottom Brewery  for a pretty yummy dinner, but not before getting harassed by a  urlLink bleeding bum  for cigarettes.  Although it wasn't a total loss cause we were held up long enough outside to run across a  urlLink bachelor party  brimming with hot, HOT guys.  Woo wooo!  The night kind of sucked from there, because we went to the  urlLink Roxy  which sucked some seriously hardcore ass.  Picture a normal, packed dance club in Manhattan, full of trendy people (even if you LOATHE places like this, just picture it for me).  Now: make these people 2 years behind in fashion and remove like three quarters of the people from the club.  Age the remaining quarter by 10 years and make half of those Portuguese, now you can imagine perhaps even the littlest bit how shitty the "Boston Roxy" was.  We left there to hit up  urlLink The Good Life  because their business card promised  urlLink oversized martinis , alas there were none.  There were, however, some  urlLink cute boys there  (although they were kicked out immediately following this photo).    We decided to split and head back to the  urlLink  Rack  so we could show Lisa how good the  urlLink appletinis  were there.  We also saw more  urlLink Boston fashion victims  laughed, danced, were accosted by boys, met some normal ones, saw some junk and almost got in a fight over a cab (fucking masshole bitches, we're WAY better).  We made it home in one piece and called it a night.   Sunday  We were all sick, we ate sushi, I puked and a bird shit on me, we drove home, we saw a bad accident.  The end, thanks for reading this much!! MwAh!
