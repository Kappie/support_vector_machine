As long as I grab my POLS final by the tail and swing it into the direction of an "A" I'm happy. I'm looking forward to seeing my parents, my sister, Irene and hopefully Scott. Missa and Gary said they would try to come, and Blair might even come. We shall see.   I'm still worried about what is to follow graduation. I so want that Disney job now that the FS is out, but I also REALLY want to go to Ft Myers for a while and CHILL OUT! Conflicting feelings... everyone says its normal, but ARRRGH!!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I got to talk to my brother tonight!!! SO EXCITING! We are what I consider very close and not being able to talk to him for the last half month (or so) has been driving me crazy. He's doing a research sailing expedition in the Pacific. Well, today they went into a port and he had the opportunity to call the family (all of us) and we got to chat for about 20 minutes or so.     http://www.tahsisbc.com/blog/2004/07/tall-ship-to-visit-tahsis-in-july-2004.html   If you go to that website (via copy and paste) you can see his ship. He talked about how he had seen dolphins riding the waves along side the ship, the humpback whale that surfaced right next to the side, the gale/storm they went through, and even what it was like to ride the bow and be plunged into the surf. I'm really excited for him.
