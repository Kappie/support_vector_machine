On Saturday me and Ayla went, and brought Maxy out in the boat, and floated around..I performed a marathon (yet terribly exhausting) swim across the lake to my air materess floating away towards shore...it was fun. I was surprised I was able to do it. Nearly died after though.   Two weeks till we leave, I'm excited. I've made a list of stuff I should bring, and remember to bring (surprisedly, I always, ALWAYS seem to forget deoderant..>  I'm stuck babysitting her tomorow and wednesday. But I'll bring over my DVD's, and maybe go to Nick's and bum some of his :P and I've got more yarn, so I can crochet, and maybe actually finish my quilt....That'd be so cool if I could. Anyways, I'm hungrey. And still sleepy. Ciao (mmm..chow..) peoples.  Ullgh.....I have so much work to do and bring with me to Qualicum..stupid....everything.
