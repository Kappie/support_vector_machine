Yes, just yellow. So? Eyes can glow another color?    That to which she is referring is neither schizophrenia nor multiple personalities disorder. To reinforce her idea on this, she even researched the two; you can be sure that her analysis is correct.  As for glowing eyes, I am aware of only one chemical which can cause this, and it has a tendancy to cause the eyes to flash in a yellow or golden light. I hold no expectation that there is no other chemical with such a property.
