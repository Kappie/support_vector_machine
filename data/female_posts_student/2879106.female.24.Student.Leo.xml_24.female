I hope he has a good time while he is there and I hope he doesn't get too depressed over the idea of leaving everything that he knows. He was supposed to go up there this weekend with Courtney but she had to bale at the last minute. I wanted to go but unfortunately I have to work. SO he is up there all by himself. I just hope he comes home soon. Anyway, I have to stop it because I am going to have to learn to deal with it.  Before I go I need to tell you that I start full time on Monday. I am so excited about the idea of having more money. But I am not excited about being in that building 40hrs a week. Also I am not excited about working full time and going to school full time. URGHHHH Oh Well sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I will just work hard and prove to myself that I can do anything I set my mind too. Pray for me because I will be praying for myself every night.
