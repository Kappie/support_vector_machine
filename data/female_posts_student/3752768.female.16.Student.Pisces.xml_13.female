Me my mom and my sister all had to go to my work so I could get my schedual and so Kendyl could pick out clothes for the fashion show she is in. Eka had a job interview but he went and got Ryan too and brought him to my house. I had asked Liz if she would do it for me (bring Ryan to my house) because she had told she would help me out since I helped her and Ryan out with one of their dates...but she threw a fit and told me the favor I did was mostly for Ryan....yeah dont even get me started a true friend would never do that. But hey I know now who my true friends are. But any ways.....    On my way home I called to see if Ryan was at my house and he was. It wasnt how I planned exactly I wanted to everthing my self but Ryan helped me cook dinner and then I locked him in my room so that I could decorate the kitchen all romantic. When I was done we sat down for a nice romantic dinner.     Ryan had told me that he didnt have enough money for roses for me....I said that was ok but really I was a little sad.  Then in the middle of dinner he got up and went to the other room and brought me back 2 dozen pink and yellow roses...OMG they were beautiful. I cried and told him that I loved him...It was awesome!    After dinner we went into my room and watched some t.v. and 'nuggled with eachother...He told me he loved me and he wanted to spend forever with me...awee...I Love him so much!    Then we got our dessert. He bought a little cheese cake. So we went into my room and we ate it and it was so cute. Then we 'nuggled some more. When 11pm came around he had to leave so I dropped him off at home.     It was the best night ever!
