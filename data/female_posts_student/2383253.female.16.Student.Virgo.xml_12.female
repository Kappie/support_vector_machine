So, of course, the doorbell rings at liek 11:30, and, who else would it be?  Nick.  We talked for about 10 minutes and then he left and I tried to get some more sleep.  In Journalism we sat around and did nothing during interviews.  I'm going on Friday.  Yay!  Now...it's time to write that English essay on "love," study for the Physics Quiz, and finish the portfolio.  Laters.
