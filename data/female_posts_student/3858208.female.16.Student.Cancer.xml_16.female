The only thing I had problems with was that I kept speeding. Don't ask me why; I never do that. Luckily I had coach Hardin, whom I've driven with before, so he knew that I don't usually do that. He made me go to his son's house lol and sit in the driveway while he talked to him. Val passed, too, yay!    It looks like the cuts I made on my leg are going to scar at least a little. I hope so, anyways.    Zeus escaped from his locked crate today. I'm not really surprised; I'm mostly curious as to how he managed it. Ever since he was a puppy he's always been the little escape artist. His middle name (yes, our dogs have middle names, shut up) is Houdini for a reason. He didn't chew anything up while he was out, thank goodness. He's been so bad about chewing on stuff other than his zillions of toys that I was seriously thinking of selling him there fora while.    We'releaving to gocamping Thursday night. It will be nice to be able to relax, although in reality I doubt I'll get any good relaxation time in because it will Zeus' first time to camp. It ought to be an interesting weekend...     RIGHT NOW     mood ::  relieved   listening to/watching ::  nothing   eating/drinking ::  nothing   craving ::  food, ha.   talking to ::  Katie   thinking about ::  I PASSED!   wishing ::  nothing at the moment, haha   wearing ::  jeans and a gray tank top   random ::  I don't like to drive, I just do it because I want the freedom it allows.
