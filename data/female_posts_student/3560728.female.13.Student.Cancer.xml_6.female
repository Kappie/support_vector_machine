I think the latter is worse, but it's what I'll probably end up doing cuz I'm so insufferably shy and screwed up...I feel like there's this major battle going on inside of me and I can't escape it no matter how I try. I'm seriously a really angry, emotionally intense person inside, and sometimes I scare myself...all of this has been totally apparent in my poetry and song lyrics that I've written and co-written with one of my friends lately. I wish I could just snuff this out like a candle or watch it fade quickly like a weak fire...I don't like being stuck in the purgatory of Indecision.  Have you noticed that everything is just one big analogy, and if it's overexplained and picked apart too much it loses it's splendor? Actually, I don't even get that...it was something that just suddenly formed in my head but what I'm trying to get at is that I wish I could stop analysing this situation, and linger in N.P's eyes...even though they won't last for ever. They'll burn out and I'll never see them again...oh God, I totally can't deal with that...I'm scared. I'm scared of myself, and what I'm feeling, and what I'm writing. I'm not in control of anything and that's seriously unnerving. It scares me that EVERYTHING that he seems to be doing that suggests he might possibly like me could all just be my imagination. Am I a romantic who's just totally desperate for this to begin? It scares me that I'm not in control of what I'm feeling I just have to go with the flow, and take risks, even though I've never been able to take them before...What's to say I'm ready to take a risk now??! There's so much at stake here and it frightens me that one decision could totally turn everything upside down. Why can't he just do all of this fucking thinking instead of me? Why am I pondering about this and Him constantly?? Why can't I forget? No matter how hard I try to distract myself, there's always someone who looks like him, only of course they'll never measure up to him...IS this an infatuation?? Am I in love?  Maybe I am, because I feel like I am...but see that's the thing, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?? I've always believed that we should leave some mystery in life and live without defining things of people, but right now I feel like I really just want to know so much stuff that I'll never find out...for example, how is he feeling about this whole thing? I bet he hasn't thought about it once...well, I'm thinking enough for both of us, aren't I? I'm getting exasperated...I went to this Grad dance thingy after school on Monday, and I passed him and he waved and yelled "Bye Emily!" and I can't even explain how I felt hearing his voice directed towards me...it was one of those little things that just makes you feel awesome. And I want more of those little moments with him...is that too much to ask for? I don't even need to date him...I just want to be with him sometimes. Right now that's the only thing I really want, but only, of course, if he wants it too. I wish I knew what he wanted because that would make this so much simpler. I'd rather know that he secretly hated me than not know anything at all...besides, that would make for some wicked emo songs...maybe I'll try to ask him discreetly about how he feels. I know I hardly know him, but the thing is if I don't move this whole thing along quickly nothing will come of all of this time spent thinking, or of my feelings...Maybe I'll ask him, and I'll be prepared for the worst, because emo will come of it, and writing an awesome song always seems to make everything alright...
