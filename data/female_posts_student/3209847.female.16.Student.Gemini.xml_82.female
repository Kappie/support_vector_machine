We shall see...  First of all and most important, I had a great time in Canada. Spending 7 days with Sarah, in CANADA, not in TEXAS, was absolutely perfect! It was just unreal. Amazing. Thank you Sarah for such a great time. I loved Bobcaygeon, your home, your boat, everything. Thank you. I don't like the heat here. Its way too damn hot in Texas right now. Oh well.  Sarah's leaving in a month and a half. It will be very sad yes, but I am so excited for her. We've promised each other we'd have an awesome time apart. I am excited to see her grow as an individual and she is very excited to see me grow as well.  I'm really tired and I might go take a nap in a few minutes. We shall see.  I'm running Spybot right now because something took over my computer while I was gone. Its so annoying. Oh! I'm getting a new computer. Very excited about it. As my birthday present. Woot.  I'll post more later =)
