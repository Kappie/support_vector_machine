Look where it got me ;) First off, ill try to keep it clean cause i know none of u want to hear about my hot passionate love for Melissa Renee Nieves so all ill say is that shes the coolest suitest awesomest and hottest girl on urth to the point that i cant spell words correctly when i think of hur.  OK!  other than that lemme think of what else to say... life is a crazy thing... right now its sort of boring what with school, band, homework, eating, sleeping, and school again... but maybe we can squeeze in a few hours of IHOP time in there somewhere... hm. Michael and Michael, i give you my sincerest reguards.  U guyz r kuul^10. ive officially recorded all the movies ive seen in a complete year since october 10, 2001.  65 movies.  thats roughly 325 dollars put to movies.  not including food and such..... but oh, its worth it.  u even get little pieces of paper with the movie theater and time u saw it.  fancy schmancy. well i think im done for the night i cant think of much else ta say. ill see you cool cats in school, baby.  later.  --Charles
