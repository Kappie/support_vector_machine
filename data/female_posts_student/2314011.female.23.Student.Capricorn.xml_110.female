After all, it's what I was trained to do in my undergraduate degree, both in and out of the classroom.  For whatever reason, the universe conspired against us and many hours were spent retaliating against Page 11.  It was a difficult battle, and many casualties were suffered.  That beautiful policy pontification; the beyond-perfect quote from a spot-on case.  Ultimately, though, we were made stronger and our papers more persuasive because of those editing passes.  Or so we've convinced ourselves.  At any rate, the thing's done, finished, turned in and left to the good graces of our esteemed Professor.  And we are all a bit happier because of it.    The weekend rounded out rather nicely.  Everything on the agenda completed, including some quality time with the orphaned novels.  Plus, dear Harley received some long-overdue attention, involving open highways and loud music.  Now the week's off and running without Monday's usual easy introduction.  In addition to the usual heavy class load, this week is full of activities: the classy dame bringing the major class action suit against Wal-Mart for gender discrimination will be here tomorrow, sharing her experience and imparting her wisdom during the day and cutting it loose with students, faculty and local attorneys at the winery downtown in the evening; Natalie's competing across the way and that always leads to exciting (if not a bit frightening) places; and Joey's birthday is Thursday, so I'll have to arrange some fireworks for that.    And then it will be Friday again!  Who knew?
