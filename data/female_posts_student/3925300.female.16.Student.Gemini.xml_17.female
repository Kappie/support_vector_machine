I watched Hidalgo yesterday....It was ok not  one of the best movies ive seen personally but o wells  Yay church tonight!! im so happy...I just havent been to church in forever  This Mortal dies... But, in the moment when the light fails here, The darkness opens, and the vision clear Breaks on his eyes The vail is rent,-- On his enraptured gaze heaven's glory breaks, He was asleep, and in that moment awakes.                                                John Oxenham  let your character or moral disposition be free from love of money, In cluding greed, avarice, lust, and crazing for earthly possessions and be satisfied with your present circumstance and with what you have...    Hebrews 13:5
