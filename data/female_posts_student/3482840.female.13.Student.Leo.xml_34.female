We got lost in the Labyrinth trying to find the bell, but Carolann  I still beat Kevin at finding everything. Mom bought me an Elven crown, that's a single strand w/ a hanging crystal. Mom's is the same only hers is two strands woven together w/ a crystal. There was this one guy there at a stand, who dressed his little poodle up as a dragon. He was sooo cute! The dog, not the guy.  Aside from all that, we saw pasrt of the Tortuga Twins' show (("We've upped OUR standards, now UP YOURS!!!")), some dagger-juggling, a comedy show by Issac Faulkes - Magician and his assistant, and bagpipe players. It was really cool.  Well that's all for now. G2G!
