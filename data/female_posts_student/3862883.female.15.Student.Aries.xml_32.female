The setting is really important in every story, because it tells you the background, where the story takes the place and even the time. In this story "Wine on the Desert" placed on the desert, and it really effect strongly to the story. If it was just placed on the forest under by strong sun, the story would be okay, but it doesn't touch across to your heart. Which means not enough power on it. The background is really important even for you. After you have all those background or basics, you can go next step after that. Can the baby run before they crawl? No, there are some steps to follow. And the setting is one of those basics in the story. It can decide the value of story by the setting or background.  It was really hard to read this book because there was so many things are described by other things. But those kinds of things grab my attention. I couldn't stop reading the story. In some parts, I just read over and over again to understand clearly. It was the best short story I ever had read.
