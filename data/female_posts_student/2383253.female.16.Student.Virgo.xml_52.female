Sorry to hear about how sick everyone got from the eggs at Six Flags, but CONGRATULATIONS on all your awards.  The band program has come along so far, and after seeing your concert, I know you were incredible.  English was...also low-key.  I read all of "Their Eyes Were Watching God" over the weekend, so I could actually participate in our activities.  Boring though.  Heather and I went to Jamba Juice at lunch and I got the new enlightened smoothie... Berry Fulfilling I think?  It was actually very good.  Made it back in time for a sub in math, where I think I did absolutely nothing productive but talk to Meryl, Julia and Jenna.  That was fun, and "Mean Girls" is officially the best movie.  Came home and went off to Gary's Tux shop to get my tuxedo.  Since Steph's dress is black and white, I got myself a super black and white tux, and I think it will be a good step up from the band tux I wear every year.  So now I'm just sitting here, making the rest of those plans for prom.  I think the most important thing is that we have a fun time, and don't get caught up in all the drama and shit that can always find itself appearing at school dances.  Later!
