I am really against with this kind of habit. I couldn’t tolerate with him no matter what he said. I couldn’t believe a good student would do this kind of things. What make me angry the most was he did not feel any sorry or regret to what he’s going to do…   He was cheating himself. It isn’t an “EXERCISE” as what he said. He refused listen to my advice and I think he would carry on his “plan”. Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! I think I should let him go, just as what he said: “JUST IGNORE ME”.  Perhaps, I have already gone too far from certain extent. I think I have put too much expectation on him. I know it clearly that I’m a no-body to him and he does not have to listen to any of my words. Ok, I shall think about it again.   To everyone of you who pass by this page:  Please, never cheat during the exam. It’s not the way. Even though you know you might fail the test or get a 0 for the test, please… do not cheat. It’s your fault. You should blame yourself and think about it clearly why you will fail the exam. Those who don’t study for their test should face the music.   P/s : I hope he would change his mind.
