I stayed up too late reading last night, but I can't get back to sleep. The Pillows rock my world. Check them out, just don't try to listen to closly to what they're saying. You won't understand it, it's japanese. Still really good though. I'm too tired to type anymore, so I'm going to leave. ~Gone~
