Then us chicks went to aprils and the dudes went somewhere else. Then they came over till 11. Then it was off to bed at around 12 cause we had to get up at 7.     Saturday:      We woke up at 7, got dressed, packed, etc. then we were off at about 8:15. So we drove for about 3 hours, got to Asateague, set up camp (me, A, S, and R got a 6 person tent!) and went to the beach where we got tan/burnt/swam in the ice cold water. Then we went back, ate dinner, watched the sunset, and went for a walk on the beach. oh! there were horses! lots and lots of them! which means shitloads of shit. it was pretty gross. but that's ok. so we went back and went to sleep.      Sunday:      We got up at like 8 and ate breakfast and got paked and stuff. Then we went to the beach just to hang out cause we didnt want to go in the car all gross. but then, like 15 minutes before we were supposed to leave, we realized that there were showers. So we all went in the water and it was much fun! then it was off to eat and go home  To anyone still reading this: GET A LIFE what are you doing still reading about my weekend? you must really love me! or are just bored probably the latter.  bye
