Three men find a jeanie and the jeanie says "tell me what you want people to say about you at your funeral, for example 'he was a great humanitarian' or 'he was the richest man i knew' and i will make it come true" the first man said "i want people to say 'he was the greatest football player of all time'" and the jeanie grants it then the second guy says something like "he was the nicest trillionare i ever met" and then the jeanie asked the third guy "what do you want people to say about you at your funeral, and the third guy says "'OH MY GOD, HE'S MOVING!'"
