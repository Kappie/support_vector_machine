Key word...ENJOY. rapeface...argh. get out of my face.  I'm feeling so tired and sick lately...I think my medication is to blame for the stomach ickyness i'm feeling...the tired part is all my fault...hey i HAD to watch the new real world episode last night at 11 okay...  Today was okay. After school was nice, no HOMEWORK for once! woo! and what did i do with this newly found free time?   I read. ...and attempted to sleep. and then matt called me and i had to go to panda for dinner. meh, I love my panda, but i also enjoy my sleep, so i was in a piss mood.  Cleary on day 28 of my cycle, as makenzie put it.   Today was a "hate people because of their bad qualities" day. Makenzie and I are the same person...seriously...she says she knows exactly what i mean when i say im in this kind of mood. Its like....i just get so negative that i see all the bad qualities of people and hate them. What? hormonal? noooo....not me.  I'm crazy right now.  I need some action. I've been actionless for weeks. I need some good fondling god dammit.   ...   My dads new girlfriend writes trashy romance novels for a living. Weird? cool? kind of...until i pick up her latest copy and it refers to my dad in it....yeah. likely senerio which would end with me throwing up all over the book, myself, and possibly the closest person to me at the moment (hopefully eating kid)  Volleyball tournament this weekend. Good. I need a break from school.  weeee.   You think your to cool for...school....*mumble* bleh bleh....  sleep.
