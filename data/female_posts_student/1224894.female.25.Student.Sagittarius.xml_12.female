More than always, I get goose bumps while reminiscing memories and moments shared. Maybe because Christmas is always a time to share, to express feelings, to give love and to be thankful for what I have. I know it definitely sounds like a cliché, but, that always make me glad.  	Sometimes, we are overworked, stressed out, and burned by all our daily experiences, and daily events. As we grow older, we become grouchy (like someone I know), temperamental (like my Mom) and impatient (like my Uncle). Sometimes, I am forgetful, like I’ve just suffered a short case of amnesia, and I can’t help it but be a grouch, but, in other cases, maturity and age sometimes make us somber and we view life in a different perspective.   	But, I think the best that we could ever do, is to not lose the child in ourselves. We have to keep in touch with our inner youth rather than be jaded by reality. I’ve often thought about the chances that I’ve ignored and the doors of opportunity that opened, yet left unexplored, and wondering if I did the right thing? But If I succumbed to regret, then, I might be living what’s left of my life as an old, grouchy and unhappy person.   	If I leave this world, as we know sooner or later we would, it just depends on who goes first, I want it to be with no regrets. Mistakes that were made in the past are the things that shaped my future. No matter how hard life is, and how bad things are, there’s no way but up.  	So, I guess, it’s up to us what we make of our future, how we would want it to be and who to spend our life with that could make our life a little more bearable as we grow older.
