OUCH!,  Today is my newphew's 9th Birthday, he is gettting so old.   I also , Have an interview, for a job, i will most likely turn down, do to my scheduling conflicts. (School)  Wednesday, was my mom's birthday, my sister and I took her to the great Cuban restaurant, it was great. As a Cuban-American, I would have to say that the food was really authentic, and tasted great.  urlLink Cubanitas , Just like mom use to make. After dinner, we took my mom to Potowatomi, she has never gambled before in her life, my mom has just turned 51. (my mom was married to my dad for 15 years, and are very strict Mormons)  My mom had so much fun. She gambled on a nickle machine on $20 for 4 1/2 hours. I lost all my money in 20min.   Just to let everyone know about this blog  urlLink joemygod.blogspot.com   This is the best writing ever. Everytime I read one of his stories, it's like I am there watching what is going on. The only thing I hate about this blog is that he stops writing when it is getting good, and says "TO BE CONTINUED" I get so mad, I swear I will never read it again, but check back every hour to the hour until a couple of days later he updates Damn you Joemygod. I suspect that this person is a writer in life there is no way that someone with that much talent doesn't write everyday.  Well just wanted to bring it everyone's attention.   ANGELA:: You should call me!! Don't be pissed!  And for Shannon's mom, she is doing great, alright for Shannon's Mom!!
