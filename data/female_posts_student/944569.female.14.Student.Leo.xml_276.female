Tuesday you are in the middle of a situation where angels fear to tread, and should also watch your step. Pay close attention to details on Friday. Monday and Tuesday investments are long-term if you don't have time to wait for profit. Monday's new love union demands the attention and patience you have little of, through Friday.
