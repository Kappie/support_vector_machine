(the ones that erica have, kailing)  and then I went and wrote notes to you guys!  I got the markers under the pretense that I needed them for my commapps project.  (and I do!  just don't NEED them... more like want to use them)  so anyways, then I just sat around for some time and ate and sat around some more.... and now I'm here typing this and thinking that I might actually sleep before midnight today!!  it would be so astounding if I did... I mean... wow!  unprecedented!!  or perhaps I'll go and write more pointless, stupid notes just so I can use my markers... yes, that sounds nice, too...  lol.  ++sunny
