I mean, she's quite pretty, and has always been the pretty natural girl, which gave us hope........ and I am just not into this whole DIVA thing......  She went from being (a little creepily, i may add) folky with "Pieces of You," to being really earthy with "Spirit," to being a little more rock-y with "This Way," and now this pop goddess phase. The following are all actual songs on the CD.   2. Run 2 U    5. 2 Find U           8. 2 Become 1                     11. Yes U Can           12. U  Me = Love         Erm. I guess the number title was appropriate..... If you'd like to sample them you could go  urlLink here ....   but I haven't even listened, so whatever floats your boat.
