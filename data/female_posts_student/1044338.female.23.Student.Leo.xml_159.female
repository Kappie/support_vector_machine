Ok, so no sign of abs yet, but I can  feel  a difference when I wear my pants. I also slacked off a bit (just a wee bit) over the weekend - I probably ate things I shouldn't have, but oh well...I got to have some fun too! I am not sticking 100% to the plan though, since it's suppose to be 40% protein, 40% carbs and 20% fat every meal/snack I have. I up the protein intake (with Isolate protein powder) and I'll sometimes substitute other ingredients in the recipes. But I think that as long as I am  relatively  eating around the same Kcounts as I am suppose to, it should be okay.
