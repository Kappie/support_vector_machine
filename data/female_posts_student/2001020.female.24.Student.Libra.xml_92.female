I hate my face, it's breaking out like mad because of all the worrying.  I wanna go out and drink but I don't really have money for that.  I am listening to the awful background music of one of No Doubt's very first singles, "Trapped in a Box."  I wanna kill myself, or the radio.  I think I'm going to nap.  I have nothing really exciting to say except, oh yes, funny story!  I was talking to my ex JB (well, actually, he came over here and we drank some beers and talked), and he happened to tell me that MP, who I hooked up with the last time I was home, worked as a maintenance man in a warehouse and never went to college (and if he did, he never graduated).  Funny, 'cause he told me he was going to go to MED SCHOOL in a year!  What a fool!  Did he really think he had to lie?  And did he *really* think I wouldn't find out?  Ha!  Idiot!  I mean, I'd still hook up with him again, but I'm totally confronting him!  I mean, he could be a slimesucker and I would've hooked up with him if I'd already made up my mind that I wanted to...it's not like he has a chance of marrying me or anything.  Oh, amusing, amusing hometown boys.
