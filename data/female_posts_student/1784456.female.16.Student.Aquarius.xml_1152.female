So I went from Japanese to French to English! AARGH! Go have fun  urlLink http://beaulieu.free.fr/japon/vocabulaire.html  And then be green with envy that they can read English and all we can say in French is "Donne-moi l'argant sinon tu vas regretter" Or some thing like that! Fun! (Oh, and they don't have a word for fun!) How sad! I could never live with that, I'd probably end up making up a random word for fun instead!
