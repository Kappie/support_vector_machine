Cai Yingning:             Saint Anthony's Canossian Sec  2. Chan Boon Luan:           Temasek Sec got to know her in first 3 months of MJC. didnt know her very well at that time. well, she is always with rebecca and not joining us. i didn't know it was a blessing or my misfortunate to be in the same class as her again. because in the first 3 months we never really talked to each other. but now, i got to know her better and she is now one of my closer friends. this girl is forever complaining that she is fat and wants to go on diet. and her diet is always going start the next week! well in my opinion, she is not fat. i think it is because of canoeing that she trained herself to become like this. but size doesn't matter. in fact i think she is quite pretty.  3. Cui Yan Ting:             Balestier Sec yanting is a very quiet girl in class. but sometimes i feel that this is not what she is supposed to be like. because she occasionally says some lame stuffs and make people laugh. and from her testimonial, i got to know that she was the band major in her sec sch. that is very very surprising. because to be a band major means that she is one who voices out her opinions and controls her people. she does join our group sometimes but i can sense that she feels that she doesn't belong here. i want to make her feel welcomed by our group, but i don't know how to go about doing it. i hope i get to see the other side of her soon.  4. Lee May Yin:              Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' Sch a nice girl she is. the first impression she gave me was someone who is very "dao" and only makes around with the guys and the cool people. so i didn't really want to mix around with her too much. however, as time goes by, i realised she is actually quite friendly, and sociable. a very smart girl too. 8 points for L1R5. like to bully me sia~ haha.. but i kinda enjoyed it and i know it wasn't intentional.   5. Low Si Ni:                Tanjong Katong Sec didn't really like her in the first place. the first time i saw her was during orientation, where she was the OGL. she was alex's dance partner. then saw her again first day in class. she sat at a row at the corner with all the guys. then a few days later i saw her again, she was late for physics lecture. again she was with another guy. this led me to thinking that she is some kind of flirt. haha, but this is totally untrue. i got to know her better, and found out that she is just being very friendly and sociable. but recently she got a boyfriend, and her results were quite bad. i guess her relationship kinda affects her studies.. which inspire me to strive harder and not to think of guys. =)  6. Lua Si Suan:              Tampines Sec SiSuan..... hmm. got to know her through Puileng. they were in S208 in first 3 months. i think she has nice hair. haha.. that's not the point. okok, she is very hardworking and diligent. this frequently gives me stress and makes me frustrated. she is also in my PW group. i was rather happy in the first place. but sometimes, i feel that the ways we do things are so different that sometimes i cannot stand her. but having her in the group is really a fortunate thing. she is like our leader, motivating us. she is like the facilitator, and she is the one who provides the most information to our project. most of the credit goes to her. she is also nice, in that she shares her secret with people, regardless of who they are. that is very nice of her.  7. Peh Kai Li Kelly:         Compassvale Sec a maths genius. she often helped me with my school works. in the beginning, i didn't like her as well. haha, that was because at that time, only me, boonluan, sisuan and tourmaline were good friends. then she always appear out of nowhere and join in between us. come to think of it, it was quite hilarious. i got to know her better, and see her as someone whom i think i can confide my problems with. she is someone who is the trustworthy type and u'll feel that your secrets with her is kept totally confidential. saw her that time at the mass dance. she looked so different from the way she usually looked like. that day, she wore all black and look like those kind of people whom u see in the street and think that they are the cool kind and u wouldn't want to offend them.   8. Seet Wei Leu:             Chung Cheng High (Main) 9. Sukhpreet Kaur:           Bedok South Sec (i think) 10. Tan Cher Min Tourmaline: Temasek Sec 11. Cheng Ying Hui Isaiah:   Temasek Sec 12. Foo Thong Seng:          Anglican High Sch 13. Kok Hoe Ming:            not yet found out. 14. Law Sin On Jackey:       Ngee Ann Sec 15. Lim Kai Fong:            Damai Sec 16. Lim Ming Hao Wilfred:    Tanjong Katong Sec 17. Loh Xun Yong:            Temasek Sec 18. Niam Chao Wei Mark:      Tanjong Katong Sec 19. Ong Shi Hao Joseph:      Temasek Sec 20. Ooi Aik Chong Shawn:     Montfort Sch 21. Siah Wei Sheng Vincent:  Maris Stella High 22. Tan Kian Tong:           Temasek Sec 23. Tay Kun Xiang:           Anglican High 24. Yeo Kian Giap:           Temasek Sec 25. Zhang Zhi Yang:          Temasek Sec  i think the rest i shall continue another day. there is too much to be said and i have go off for my dinner now!!!! =)  [Love is like a knife.
