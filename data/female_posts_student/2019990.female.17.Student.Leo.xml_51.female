Granted they were developd at Walmart's one hour photo, but still even they should be able to do better than this.  It looked like they printed them off, and the printer was running out of ink.  The color saturation was nowhere near what it should have been.  They all have these lines running through them, and there is one line on each picture that is the saturation it should have been.  So from now on, Walmart will take no part in developing my pictures.  I got back some of the ones from when the EGS'ers were at Laura's house.  I had two of those that looked decent.  One of Uma, and one of Giles.  But the rest are crap.  My aunt from ND was trying to tell me that the focus was off, but it wasn't, you just couldn't see anthing because of the lack of color.  I seem to be really upset about this.  You wouldn't think it should matter so much.  It's strange. Well anyway.  I met the other lady that is going with my aunt and I to the Ukraine.  She's seems a little scatter brained.  Although she did manage to find us almost 20 bibles in Ukrainian.  We're going to be giving those to some of the orphans. Right now I'm reading Main Street, and I'm so frightened by it.  One of the farmers even has the same last name as one of my dad's emloyee's does.  I really wish I had my own copy so I could hilight the parts that sound like home.  Oh, i wish I had a hilighter too.  This entry really isn't going anywhere, so I think I will.  I'll talk to you all later.
