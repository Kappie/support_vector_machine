Like...Bill said "I dont know how to play Minesweeper" so I explained it to him..and when I did he was like "you're wrong" I've been playing that game for a long ass time, because my Uncle is the shit at it and he taught me when I was little. I want to ram a fucking spoon into the back of his throat...that had no purpose..:-P that wouldn't really do anything...but hey, atleast I didnt say that I wanted to stab him. I love Bill...I just hate when he tell's me I'm wrong when I'm not. AHHH! Anyway...I kind of had fun today I guess. They day was pretty much boring though, because Bill and I spent barely any time together at all. Now...this is what Bill got on and said to me.  NegativeWilliam: I can't do this shit.. Auto response from NegativeLaura: waiting for Ashley to get on...:-) NegativeWilliam: ..can't do it..NegativeLaura: You can't do whatNegativeWilliam: Bye.NegativeLaura: DO WHAT? NegativeWilliam: Just can't be with you..NegativeWilliam: ..just can't..  It's like..what the fuck, I didnt do anything..I was just explaining how to play a game and then he tells me I'm wrong even though he didnt know how to play it from the beginning:(....I also hate how he gets mad because I hate the phone. It's not so much that I hate the phone all together, but that I hate the phone at night..and he likes to talk at night. Yeah, sometimes I swallow my anger and talk to him, but it's just like...It's sooo frustrating because we never get off until really late at night, and then he gets mad when I dont call him early in this morning. It's just like AHHH! I'm not complaining..it's just SOOOOO frustrating. But I still love him:)...  I had to let Charlie go, but I dont feel like getting into that. Actually, I dont feel like doing anything anymore. Sorry I haven't been updating a lot..I'll try to update more from now on.  Oh yeah..The Goonies! haha..GREAT movie! ::claps hands::
