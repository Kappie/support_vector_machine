I am kind of distracted coz firstly, I am listening to the Community Chest's Charity Show and on the other hand, I am kind of confused as I have too much stuff to tell to the world. Hmm... Let's see, let me start from Friday onwards.    *Friday*  After I have done what I am supposed to do, I went to my Senior's house. Hiaz... what to do? All my other friends have plans and I also have my ''appointment'' with my Senior... I went to her house in the morning and we hang around till my other friend came over. ---PAUSE---   *My brother is using the com., will update later... See ya*                                         ---END---
