But, I watched the game on my fuzzy TV and was glad to see Michigan do some stompin'.  Hopefully the rest of the Big Ten can step up to the plate, too.  I was reading Matt's Northwestern magazine today (the alumni association hasn't figured out where I live yet), and I never cease to be amazed by how ridiculous some people are.  The last ten or so pages of the magazine are dedicated to alumni notes, which include weddings/births/deaths, but also random things sent in by alumni.  I mean, we have so-and-so from WCAS01 who sends in a note that they are now working for Kraft as a "cheese consumer data analyst."  Who the hell cares??  If it was a joke, it would be one thing, but it seemed totally serious (as it was paired with an announcement about what the person's fiancee was doing).  Matt joked that he should send in a note to say that he is now a cheese consumer and see if they'd publish it.  If you're actually doing something cool with your life, by all means tell the world.  But if your job sucks, why advertise it?   So while I can't say that I've completely gotten over my addiction to email (I checked yesterday and I've actually sent something like 150 emails in the month I've been home), I've gotten to the point where I'm less enthused, probably because no one is emailing me back.  But, once again, not everyone is as psycho as me.  And I suppose it's true that once classes start, I'm just as bad as everyone else.  Only three more days...
