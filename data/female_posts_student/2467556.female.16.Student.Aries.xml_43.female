First we score the beginning goal, then L.A. scores before 1st period is over.  THEN we score another goal and we hold the win for almost the rest of the game.  UNTIL the last 30 SECONDS!!!!!  at 21 seconds left in the game, the L.A. people score and it was a terrible goal that i personally think Marty could've blocked.  Oh man, you should've seen the players on the bench's faces.  Niko looked like he was about to kill someone, Zubie almost broke his stick, Mattie looked like he was trying to convince himself it was all a bad dream, and Jere looked like he was about to cross the ice and hit Marty over the head.  I would've hit Marty, probably yelled at him alot too.  I'm sorry, but at this moment in time i think Marty Turco sucks at life.  And of course that game ended 2-2 in overtime.  Well, at least we played better than we did on Friday where the under-30 team called Pheonix kicked our asses major 6-0.  I was at that game too but i left early.  I weep for the Stars.  So i haven't really done much of anything for the past 2 days except eat, sleep and watch hockey.  Oh and i did homework for a little while, but i've decided i'll just finish it in French 1st period.  Wish you all the best of luck trying to get up for school tomorrow,  ~~~Taylor~~~
