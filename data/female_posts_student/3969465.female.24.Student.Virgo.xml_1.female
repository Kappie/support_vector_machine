At least it'll give my flatmate yet another opportunity to call me a 'geek' and doing this is a bit like going on Ricki Lake anyway- baring my soul to the entire disinterested world.    Granted, I reckon the world would be interested, if I started shouting randomly at people as though I were in Jerry Springer, participating in one of those ludicrously complicated stories in which one's mother has stolen one's boyfriend who then turns out to be gay and has an affair with your younger brother after having impregnated your younger sister, who by the way is not your sister but the baby you had when you were thirteen and that your mother graciously took on as her own to spare you from the shame... grand and then you go on Jerry Springer to reveal it to the world!    Yes, I do think that if I wrote stuff like this here, I could arouse a certain albeit perverted interest in my life. But since I neither have a younger sister nor a younger brother, nor any intention of ending up on Jerry Springer telling the rest of the world that I'm a 'whole lotta woman, girlfriend' I'll desist and instead bore all those who chance upon this with what they never wanted to know!    Part of this exercise is to keep a'fieldwork diary' in which I follow Cressida's footsteps, whom I should have mailed ages ago but failed to do because of several reasons.  Fieldwork? Ah, yes, some of those who may chance upon this may be labouring under the impression that as an anthropologist, doing fieldwork involves sitting around in a mud hut somewhere in the highlands of Papua New Guinea during the monsoon season, wishing one were back home, but as for me, it doesn't.    Doing my fieldwork in Germany, that doesn't apply and I know, I know, some maysay that I'm doing nothing but going back home. Buteasy as it sounds, it doesn't work quite that way. Here's a bit of biography for everyone to get the picture: Having grown up in a remote village in Germany(out of the door into the cow-s**t) I left home immediately after leaving school to move to London, to go to university.Five years later, having never lived in Germany as an adult and therefore knowing full well what to do to get a phone connection in Englandetc, I suddenly find that I have no clue as to how living in Germany works.    Take a simple thing for example: Litter! How many of you have seriously ever spent days on end trying to figure outwhat to do with one'strash and then, despairing because thesystem of dividing it up is so complicated, resolved to drive the 20 minutes to France to dispose of it there?  I get a lot of stick for such things from my compatriots who all fail to understand that a) things weren't so complicated when I left, b)things are a little different in England and c) it may sound crap but it's number one in Germany.    The latter at least relievedme from years of trying to defend my compatriots against accusationssuch as that David Hasslehoff is still a force to be reckoned with in the German music industry. Yes, I say, yes, he is! And finally I have solved the puzzle surrounding my inexplicably bad taste in music- it's not my fault, it's part of my culture and upbringing, and I have a whole nation standing behind me sharing the same bad taste!
