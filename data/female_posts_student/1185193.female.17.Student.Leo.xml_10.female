Famished from not eating lunch and trying to operate on a 6am bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios, I race down to  urlLink Whole Foods  to get something to eat.  I love their store so much because it has diverse, fun food.   Plus, it also has totally delectable fresh food  to order. So I headed over to that section on the far left of the store and got an organic burrito, sliced pineapple, and a  urlLink Pom .  Sounds yummy, right?  So I return home, pop the burrito in the microwave, and begin devouring my  pineapple and juice.  By this time, I am like  starving for this spicy, succulent burrito.  I am literally tapping my foot, counting down with the microwave.  Bing!  Oh, yes...it smells so good!  I set up my little lunch on the paper bag that it came in by the computer to check on the afros that I ordered for my Jefferson's dance.  I decide to print the confirmation receipt of my order, roll back my chair to reach the printer, and my food goes flying everywhere!  It  was another one of those "f***!" Starbuck's moments.  I didn't even get a taste of the burrito before it gracefully hit midair and plummeted to the carpet!  I scrambled to salvage it, but it was definetely unedible-looking.  Since it has been getting warmer outside, my cat has been shedding her hair, and we've been doing our best to keep the carpet clean, but the the cat hair was glued to the innerds (innards? too lazy to look it up) of the burrtio.  Very disappointed.  So I just ate my pineapple and drank my Pom, cursing at my cat and my natural tendency to spill things.
