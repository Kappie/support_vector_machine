It was a lot of fun though. I didn't get to see Sara though, or watch Finding Nemo with Lauren. That sucked, but other than that it was cool. Lauren, Max, and I hung out last night which was...a lot of fun. Heh heh. Well, I guess parts of it weren't fun, but we all got a chance to talk and it was really nice.  Anyway, I'm reallllly tired and I still need to call Chris and probably Bryan to explain stuff haha.  I was just talking to Emily about Bryan and I, and she's like, "sounds like things are going well with you and Bryan," and I was going to say, "yeah, definitely," and then I realized...well, things are going well on MY end, but I don't know if he's happy about stuff, so I told Emily that and she reassured me. Why am I so paranoid? Oh well.  Alright, I think I'll go...I don't know, do something productive.
