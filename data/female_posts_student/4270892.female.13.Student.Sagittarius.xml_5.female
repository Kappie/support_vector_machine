A simple slide of silver razors across the delicate skin of my fragile wrists...a knife across my throat, or an overdose of Coriciden ending it all. But I cannot die...not yet. I couldn't bear to leave knowing how many would be hurt by my loss...Bianca, Ainsley, Ali, Stephanie...:( And more. I know Ains wont wanna read this..he'll freak. But sometimes i need to feel better by writing shit down...  Anywhoo..hehe...I'm in love. With a sweet teddy bear...ainsley. aww....hehe. yea....comments peeps!
