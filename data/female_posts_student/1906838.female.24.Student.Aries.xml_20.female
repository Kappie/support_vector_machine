And it all stems from the fact that i am bothered with the BIG issue which has been haunting our relationship eversince the day he told me  that there was this BIG issue. Hell .. my ex had the same kind of BIG issue and now ... i told myself that i would never ever get tangled up with BIG-issue ( err... i dont mean the magazine sold by the homeless) guys. Even gave the same advice to my ex's sister who is herself like a sister to me. And having survived such a traumatic relationship which was damaged by the BIG issue anyways .. am I any wiser???   The fact is i am starting to have some feelings of affection for him now .. and with that affection, there often is an associated possessiveness as well. I mean, the BIG issue bothers me .. not a LOT but it does. And i regret the fact that because i am letting this BIG issue to bother me, i always tend to find faults with him .. and end up being like your classical shrew .. which i dont think i am.. or am I?  i told myself .. there are many ways to deal with this so-called BIG issue i have with him. I know that the BIG issue shall only stop bothering me once i stop loving him. It will never go away ... it will stay with him forever because that's just what he is. A guy with a BIG issue. My options are .. leave him and hence the BIG issue shall automatically no longer be a BIG issue for me, or continue this BIG-issued relationship regardless of the BIG issue ( ie ignoring it completely), or to confront this BIG issue and try to resolve it myself .. which is impossible because like i said this BIG issue is permanent. No way around it.  *sigh* .. BIG issue or no BIG issue i want him to know that i dont mean to be nasty to him .. i dont mean to holler at him like some mad woman. its just that i am bothered by this BIG issue. God, i wish one day i could just wake up and find that this BIG issue would have miraculously decided to disappear on its own ...
