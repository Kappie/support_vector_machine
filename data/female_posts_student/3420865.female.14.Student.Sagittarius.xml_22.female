"KATE HAS A PENIS NAMED NOAH!"-chloe. wow, best quote ever.  "what colour do you want your conversation box to be?"-me "black. no. orang. e. orang with an e."-chloe "ok. as apposed to the orange without an e..."-me  sofija drew me a picture today. it has a pair of pants (my pants) and it has a little boy sitting in the middle of them (around the crotch area, in case you were wondering). it represents noah being in my pants. but chloe came up with another interpretation for it: he is my penis. but you know, whichever works.  i made my mum buy fortune cookies today... wow they're the best things ever! but the fortunes sucked.  *opens fortune cookie* "'you will have a very good life in your old age.' sweet."-james *opens another one.* "'you will have a very good life in your old age.' what the hell? didn't i just get that one... ok. so it means that i either will have a VERY very good life in my old age, or they cancel out eachother. frik."-james  ack. i would have more quotes, but i'm on my computer upstairs (i was using the one downstairs today, and ALL of the good quotes are on it). so we'll save those for another day.  ok so. worst blog ever.  eeeeek. movies tomorrow. apparently it's cheap night ($8), so it shall be fun.  well, i'm outtie now. paice. (i love how i ALWAYS say paice. cuz, you know, i'm gangsta.)  i will play until the sky is black.  kayte.
