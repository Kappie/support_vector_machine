A bunch of us went out to see Fahrenheit 9/11 and then wanted to go to Zen Cha, but it was closed. So next best thing? The Shi Sha lounge on High St. I've never smoked anything before, but since I know its really watered down tobacco, I admit, I have always been a little curious about shisha. It was rose flavored to boot, and the pipe (someone said its also called a bong, but I thought a bong was the smaller kind of pipe, whatever) was really pretty, so I tried it. Donny kept laughing at me when the smoke made it mostly out of my nose and the rest came out my mouth. Apparently I didn't smoke properly. But I did smoke a lot. I was in between Scott and Oren, so each time they passed the pipe back, I got another hit. Smoking twice as much as either of the guys didn't make a difference though. There was no buzz, no sting, no coughing. I think I would definitely do it again given the right group of people and a good flavor. And no, its not my gateway to more nicotine. I hate cigarette and cigar smoke. Its too acrid. I wonder though if the Smoke Free Columbus deal applies to Shi Sha. Especially since its a really weak smoke. I guess I wouldn't miss it if it did. Glad I tried though.
