They exude love, like the perfume air of flowers in bloom, or musky scent of pine trees on warm nights.  They have a long story, longer then some I suppose, but not as long as others.  I was there the night she went to his dorm room door to take him things to fix a cold and I knocked on the door and ran to force her to talk to him.  She was so angry.  I was a part of several practical jokes they played on each other in a butterfly courtship flirting that lasted another year before they could say that they were truly in love.  I was there when her roommate had a crush on him.  I have sat with them and watched Durango mountain sunsets.  I was there the night he wrote her, confessing his love, and the night he came over asking advice on a gift.  Their joy pours through me, so excited, like they are both breathing for the first time, like it is the first time they have really known God, though they are both deeply spiritual people of the Christian faith.  I will known them as we all grow old, because that is the kind of friends they are.  I will stand near her at the wedding, dress in the most tactful bridesmaid dress I have ever seen, something that I want to dance in, or wear bare foot out into a clearing with aspen leaves raining down on me while Beethoven plays in the back ground.  I will stand near her and I will cry, letting hours of makeup and prep time run down my cheeks in rivulets.  I will not be able to stop, because I can hear their vibrations nearing one another in a note of yes.  There will be no dancing at their wedding.  It is at a Baptist church and apparently they don't agree with that.  But I will step outside, drawing them with me in my heart, and maybe a few of the other bridesmaids who know that god is the air under your heels, and we will dance in the parking lot praising and thanking with wild spins, I will thank in my own way that one day like this will exist for my friends, and I will thank that there is space for moments of sugar sunlight and sweet violets in this vibrating violin string world.
