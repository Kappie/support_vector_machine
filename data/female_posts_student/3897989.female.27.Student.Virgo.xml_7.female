I should have journaled this out last night, because I had nightmares all night long. I felt so disconnected from myself. My smile was so hard to find. I took time for myself that morning, but it seemed nothing went right from the time I stepped outside my home. By the time I got to work I was in a sourpuss mood. I know it's time for my monthly pms, but I usually have more control over it that I did yesterday. I felt like a negative magnet yesterday. I'm so glad that day is over!! My coworker pissed me off and I let her know about it, I parked in the "wrong" parking space and had to move, I forgot about our sales meeting, it took forever to get things accomplished yesterday, I kept dropping everything (thank goodness nothing was breakable), I was triply exhausted when I got home last night. Then my ex starts in how he doesn't want to go home, just let him stay. How he's so in love with the "old/new" me. He doesn't realize how he stifled who I really was for 9 years. Without him, I am able to express freely without bondage and criticism. We go through this every time he stays with the kids while I'm gone, but I just didn't feel like hearing it last night. I was a total bit@# at work and at home yesterday. I was really pissed because the side that my classmate worked on versus the side that my instructor worked on was very swollen. Only a couple people noticed that I was ill, so most of it was internal dialogue. I tried to be positive, but to get through the day only, was a challenge. I did make it through, and that's the important thing. Life goes on whether we sweat it out or not. It is passed and over with and no more time shall I dwell. My time is worth devoting to comforting and nurturing my positive energetic efforts.   I did go and see my hairdresser on lunch yesterday. She has opened her own salon. She's invited me to rent a room from her when I get my license. I've had several other offers here in town,but I know her establishment is where my journey needs to begin. It's right on Broad St., the heart of the city, plenty of parking, I've known her for 9 years and she's known for not being your typical "gossiping" cosmotologist, she's very professional and brings in the "big time" clients. What really sold me on her new place (teary eyes) was when I walked in the front door, the whole place has a beach designtheme. My heart often tries to carry me back to the time when I had my first awe inspiring moments there. The walls are alternately done in ocean blue and sandy brown. One wall has been painted to looklike you're under the ocean. Huge seashell spiral chimes are hung in each corner. Fishnet and starfish are on the upper ceiling. She showed methe room for rent. I'm the only one who will have a "room". It's quietly placed right beside the bathroom. It's alarge room with new berber carpet that looks like sand. I would want to keep the beach theme in thereeven though I ultimately want an oriental theme when I find a permanent place of my own,more like a holistic healing theme. What's so strange is my deep tissue instructor's office is done with the beach theme also. It feels right and I wouldn't have to work for anyone, I could come and go as clients demand. She told me anytime I needed practice on anyone she has plenty of client volunteers. If they could only count toward my school hours. She's going to be very good for my business. I found outyesterday that they are no longer doing Massage Therapy at the hospital here in town anymore. They are too short handedin the physical therapy side, so they had totake that part out. Hmmm.   I'm thankful for the opportunities that have arisen in my life. I feel immense power resonating within my mortal nature. My heart slowly heals with scars that form a net for all the thingsthat I shall capture tobringthe expression of my true self.    With love,   BLG
