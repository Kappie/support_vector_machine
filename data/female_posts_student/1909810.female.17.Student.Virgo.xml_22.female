Hopefully I'll be able to find my brothers appartment, it shouldn't be too bad.    My cat was just giving me the scariest look. It's sitting on top of the screen with its paws hanging off the edge and was staring straight at me with one i completely open and the other only half way. I think I've become obsessed with this little creature. She got stuck on the roof today...I had to rescue her, and yesterday she was stuck in a tree. Poor thing.  I got out my violin today and managed to tune it...I was surprised.  I am teaching myself a Yellowcard song, it's a band that has a violin in it. Yay. I like playing.  I should have never given it up, damn me and my...stupidity.  I am getting tired, and seeing that I will be driving tomorrow I should sleep. Good Night.
