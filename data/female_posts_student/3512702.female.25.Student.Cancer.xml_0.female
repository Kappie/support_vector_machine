Oh let me Tell You..He was just great. He sang all his well known hits except "1999" :( sad but expectable. At one point Prince just sat down with his guitar and a stool and the spotlight and sang acoustic versions of "Cream, Little Red Corvette and Rasberry beret" BRILLIANT!!!!  He also did a copy of Led Zepplins "Whole lotta' love" that in itself was awesome. Last song he opened up his shirt and revealed a Pistons jersey and the crowd went nuts! Concert supposivly ended and the lights went out and the crowd roared and lighters flared and 5 mins later you see a purple rain looking curtain appear and you look to your friends and say.."Now would he REALLY do a concert and NOT sing "purple rain"!!!????? OF COURSE NOT!!!!!!! That song is so beautiful and I'm so thankful I got to hear it done live and by the master himself. Oh my god it was just breathtaking..At the end where its just the guitar and "oooooooooooohhhooooohhohhhh!!.." The whole entire audience had control over that one!! The concert was an almost entire 3 hours which I hear is longer than the previous Michigan concerts done this summer. Halfway through the concert I'm already begging my husband, "can we please come back for the 31st show???!!!!"  Ha most likely in my dreams but hey, Prince is worth seeing 1,000 times over again. I was lucky and got 2 shirts, one which I am so proudly wearing today. Now I have concert-idas..stems from going to a kick ass concert and not getting quite enough!! God Bless Prince:)
I wanna go back!! 
By the way....I miss somebody-------where the heck are they:P??
