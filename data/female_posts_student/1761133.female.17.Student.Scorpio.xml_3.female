You may be tempted to lie about it, or at least avoid mentioning the situation. Don't give in to the temptation, however, dear Scorpio. Your desire to shield those you love is understandable - but could lead to upsets in the future. There are things you can't protect people from forever, and most people prefer to know the facts.
