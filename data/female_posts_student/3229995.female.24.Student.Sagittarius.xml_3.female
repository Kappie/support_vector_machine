It all seemed to   work out for Sissel in the mid-90s with her excelent performance with Placido Domingo on the Norwegian Olympic song 'Fire in Your Heart', the Europeen number one hit 'Prince Igor' and singing the soundtrack for 'Titanic', but then the songbird went silent. She had been a superstar in Scandinavia since her debut in 1986 with 'Sissel' and her huge hit 'Love' ('Kjaerlighet'). She is to date the most successful artist to ever come from Norway and no artist has sold more records in Norway than her.   'All Good Things'   is a streamlined pop album with no big highs or lows. What the album can show for is Sissel's trademark; her remarkable soprano voice. Forget Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Barbara Streisand and other great vocalists, Sissel has one of the most superiour voices in the world, she sings like an angel.
