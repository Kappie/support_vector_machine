LIfe still sucks...like i say..that's what my stupid brain tells me. Shuttup man.. U SUCK.  Does brain have gender? I wonder... I feel that my brain and my tangible form seemed at odds with each other. I looked female but my brain's a transversite..Can't help it. That's the only way I can rationalize why my brain hates me so much.  I want to look into tommorow without the shades covering my eyes!   Zouk sent me another pamphlet today. Hmm..the Linkin Park Thingy looks tempting.. BUT i'm BROKE...AS USUAL money doesnt only make the world go round..it makes my world stop too. Damn.... wanna go for Moby PLay..but it's over I guess... sighz..a pauper's gotta do, what a pauper's gotta do.. *find sugar daddy!* haha Well, I'll set out my task to look for a sugar mummy though..Men after all sucked..they painted my cornea with black oil. Going to be an usher tom for  church..hurhurhur weird. I dun remember if i ever been holy. I'm a schizo man..I lead double livessss but u know what?  Like I did actually care.
