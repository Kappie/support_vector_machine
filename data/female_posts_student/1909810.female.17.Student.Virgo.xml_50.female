My brother came home, and I was eating dinner with my family, and I was talking quite a bit...and only recieving these blank stares in return, then after dinner in the living room with my brother and my dad I received the same looks and sure, they talked to me a little...but it always seemed like they had this "when is the bitch going to shut up" kind of tone to their voice...and maybe I was being a bitch...i donno...it didn't seem like I had an attitude...but I had a lot to say and it felt like everyone wanted to tell me to shut the fuck up...and it was like....gahh it pissed me off. Or maybe it was just that I didn't have anything interesting to say...am I really  that  boring?  Yes Sarah...yes yes you are. GAH! I should just stop talking completely...that would be fun...anyways my mom did the same thing yesterday...i was trying to talk about something i thought was funny and i was reading something to her, and i maybe had about 3 sentences left and she goes "alright that's enough" and walks away. What the fuck is that about!? They don't understand why sometimes i don't feel like talking and when i actually for once want to share something they don't give a shit! I'm just angry...lately I've been feeling a bit...ignored I guess you could say, by friends and family alike. Maybe I'm making all of this up in my head.  Could be.  I'm just pissed right now.  Another thing, i love my brother and all..but when he comes home from school...my mother! GOD! I'm sure I'm probably exaggerating some of it in my head, but she acts like he's this amazing wonderful being worthy of everything...I donno...I just feel...less important when he's around maybe? I can't describe it.  I feel like so much more of a bitch to my mother when he's here...that's what she makes me feel like...or...the way her actions when he's here make me feel like. Something like that?  Maybe it's just I like her better when he's not here. Oh well, what the fuck, I'm just going to sit here drinking my rasberry hot chocolate and reassure myself I am making this all up.  I'm convinced I'm a psycho...
