That came from Joy and I's talk about how in Washington, DC at breakfast when Joy tried to throw a cornbread muffin at Julia, but instead she missed and it his Ashleigh in the back of the head. OMG!!! So funny!! I was sitting between Ashleigh and Rob McClenaghan and all I could hear was me and Robert's laughing, Ashleigh's screaming at Joy, and Joy's loud squealing/shrieking laugh in back of me. Ashleigh went on a murder rampage after that incident. When I was talking to Joy on the phone, before I even brought the topic up, I was in hysterics, shaking and crying from laughter before Joy even knew what was going on. So, now I have an incredible headache from laughing so hard. Um, I'll do another post in about a half-hour, so until then all! Love and Madness!
