Kanina ko lang napansin ang happiness ng mga tao sa mukha nila. Talagang nung Monday at medyo nung Tuesday, ang lungkot ng mga tao. Tapos ngayon, makikita mo sa mga mukha nila at sa mga ngiti na abot langit ang tuwa nila, at kasama na ko dun, having Sir Guinto around.     I know it was only "God's plan" and part of life that, that happened to us. But at least we've learned a lesson not to take someone for granted.   Memories...  It's nice to bring back all the memories. Even though we had some tears or sadness in the past, its nice to remember all these and see what it has done to us now in the present.  Just like the one I said, after the tears and anger we had before, now I can see some discipline and LOTS of happiness and laughter in their faces.  Ang saya tingnan ng mga tao  after  all that  happened .      **Sorry for bringing back that topic...Ãœ**
