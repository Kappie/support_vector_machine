Amanda and I have took it upon ourselves, in a way to honor Natalie, to incoprorate the folling words into our vocabulary: golly, jimminy, gollygeewiz, silly, swell and exceterea. (I added the last one.. if you don't mind Amanda, I think it adds a nice touch.)  Rehersal sucked today. Sucked sucked sucked. It was just loong and boring and my feet hurt. Yes, I know what you are thinking, "whine, whine, whine, all you do is whine Caitlin!" Well, it's true, but this is my blog and I can whine all I want. Actually there was a pretty funny part of today.         It happened in the time directly following lunch. The actors were clearly bored and tired and the sound of the heavy rain patting against the roof filled their ears. Natalie was staging "Right Track" and the mood was strained as 20 bored people tried desperatley to focus and learn the tedious dance. Caitlin's feet hurt as she has just started breaking in her new Capezio T-strap character heels. Then suddenly, the actors heard a strange noise coming from the back of the theater, intantly gaining their attention and shattering their focus. But what was this strange noise? It took them a few seconds to figure out it was none otherthan....SAM. Yes, Sam was sitting in the back of the theater with his headphones on and his head burried in his script. His eyebrows were furrowed in deep concentration. The strange sound reaappeared and once again it took the actors a few second to realize, not only was it Sam, but that he was singing! Very loudly from the back of the theater was Sam singing "Love song.. na na na na na na na na na." over and over. Only, he was not just loud and distracting, but not even close to the right notes. It soudedmore like someone singing in the shower loudly over a radio than the lead in a local musical. The noises continued as Sam was unaware that he was being loud and distracting. Finally, James, being fed up with the childish giggles and feeling bad for Sam (or most likely, just wanting him to shut up) asked Natalie, "should I go tell him.." Interupting him Natalie answered, "No actually, I kinda like it." Then all the actors laughed appropriatley and Sam said, from the back of the theater, "Go ahead, laugh all you want." Apparently he was well aware of his singing loudly and being distracting. Although, I'm not sure he knew he was singing badly.         Sorry, I am a horribly mean and awful person. But only to Sam.. because he can take it. Basically that little story was the only fun part of my day. Other than that it was pretty tedious. Thats all. But I love Sam, I really do. And I don't know what I am going to do when him and Joe go to college. They are like my best friends right now... I don't know, whatever happens I just hope we don't lose touch. I hope I don't lost tough with anyone who goes to college. It will be so sad!  And by the way.. I AM GOING TO BE A JUNIOR NEXT YEAR!! what!? How is that fair! It feels like middle school wasn't too long ago.. and the 8th graders, they can't be SENIORS!!! This part of growing up and everyone getting older.. kind sucks. Because really.. those guys aren't seniors, and I am definatley not an upperclassmen. Ahh! Scary. And cool. I take that back.. its just cool. Haha! I'm an upperclassemen. (This is the point in the entry where the reader stops to think to themselves.. "Hmm, is Caitlin on crack?")  Ok, I have said enough for today. And I don't have a very interesting evening planned so I doubt I will update anymore unless I get really bored.  Love Always, Caitlin  PS- Leave a comment!
