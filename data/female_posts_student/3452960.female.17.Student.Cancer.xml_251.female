Dave and myself will leave you tomorrow for a two day expedition of some of the most extreme terrain ever seen on Bodmin Moor.  Preparations have begun. Even as I write, I'm eating spaghetti bolognese.  We will be offline for almost 36 hours.  And we won't be able to reply to your texts. (Dave couldn't anyway cos he has no credit)  So, if, in our absence, you pine for our company...  Tough. We are not here.  (PS, I don't think anyone has   ever  pined for my company, but nm.)
