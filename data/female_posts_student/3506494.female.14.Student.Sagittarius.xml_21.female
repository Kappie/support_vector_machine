I went there pretty early...about 11ish and didn't end up leaving till 9:50. XD We just laid around, watching X-Files(Creepy! O_O) and such. A woman, as Kelsey puts it, was totally Invisi-raped. XD Nolan and his friend were being weird and dragging eachother around in sheets. Strange kids.  From Trey's I went over to my Girl Scout's leader's house because our troop was totally going to Magic Mountain. It was so damn fun. I got to ride on all the scary rollercoasters. =0 Man, I was so scared of one that I was actually hyperventilating and getting dizzy before I even got on it. XD it turned out to be a blast though. The only bad thing about the trip was the 8 hour bus ride there and back while trying to SLEEP. My back is killing me. =(   Yeah. Now I'm home.   I got my glasses. I look lame.
