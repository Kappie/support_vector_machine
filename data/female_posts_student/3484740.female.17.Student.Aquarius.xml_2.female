Which, I know of a few just by him telling me...also his comments like, "most of mine were virgins so theres no way I have anything" and I already know half of them were young. So my comment was very true. I did perhaps go to far with the 10 year old thing, but it was meant in a way, of me saying they were young. Which, compared to his age, they might as well be 10.   Yes, this is public, but no one can find it, at least, no one knows who I am if they do read it. Does it say my name anywhere? Does it have my picture anywhere? No...it sure doesn't. For that reason exactly. I started this ONLY because he wanted me too. He wanted me to start to Xanga one, he wanted me to continue the one he made for me a while back on his site, so I started this one. I'm not very good with words, so writing things down in a letter or on here is much easier for me than actually telling someone. Either way, the message still gets across. Its funny, since I was falling for him again. I couldn't handle the distance before, and now that I don't have a car, it would be really hard. He is busy, he is always talking about all the things he has to do, I don't want to mess things up for him. I was always doing something to screw things up with him, maybe not him, but with other people. People started to not like him or talk bad or whatever when we got together, things happened with teachers that never happened before. So yea, I didn't want to bring all that back on him. No I haven't told him this, but I really don't care.   So you can say whatever you want to say, it doesn't make a difference to me, but it would be very nice if he could grow up for a few minutes and let me tell him a couple of things that he needs to know. Perhaps he could shut up and actually listen to me and then quit talking to me. Not talking to him, would be completely fine. I don't need him, I have no desire to want to be with him anymore, so it really makes not difference to me. Yes, I did want to be with him a couple weeks ago, and I even asked him more than once to come see me. He came on bad terms and that was my fault as much as it was his. It didn't work out the way I had planned on him coming for the first time. But life goes on.   All I want is to say a few things and I'll be gone. If I'm a bitch, then hes a bastard. Because you can't judge until you know everything, and I'm sorry hun, you don't.
