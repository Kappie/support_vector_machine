The past few days was okay, I went for a field trip in Grand Corpthone hotel, it was okay la... then i went to Orchard with my friend and the both of us are feeling very pain lor, cause we are wearing heels and walking along Orchard road...  Been watching quite a number of tv programmes these days and typing my work... Will be rushing for projects soon... I'm just a last- minute person...lolx...  Heard from my friends in sec sch that they have got their 'O' level chinese results le... Some did well, some did not... Well, for those who have done well, a good job done. For those who have not, continue to work hard... I, nyself retook my 'O' levels chinese, it ain't that bad though!  Just something to add on... If you met a person who's very much a like to another in terms of behaviour, would you mistook the first for the latter???  Answer?
