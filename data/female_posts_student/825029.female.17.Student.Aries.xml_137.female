I’ve been busy and stuff- no time for my blog  Well, I can’t exactly recap everything that’s happened since my last post, so I’ll just say that things have definitely been better.  But, oh well- everything will work out in time : )  So yesterday was Earth Day so I had to go to a stupid NHS trash pick-up... then went to IHOP for breakfast so that was yummy.  Then went home and showered and went to the galleria for a while.  Then I went to Godspell with Becca last night... it was really good.  But the weather sucked.  A lot.  I was really worried about my car... the hail was crazy!  So after Godspell was over, Becca and I hauled butt outside and it was too dark to see if there was any damage, but since I had parked under a tree, my car was coated in leaves.  I couldn’t even see out of my back windshield.  So I took her home and my mom called me and was like “HURRY HOME” so I hurried home, only to find that the hail had broken one of our skylights, so there was a huge HOLE in our roof.  So my parents and I are standing outside in our driveway and the neighbors behind us come out and one of their skylights broke, too... so my dad and our neighbor went up onto each roof and put plastic over the holes and then buckets and trash bags and stuff on the floor in the house.  Then I go in my room, only to find that my window is leaking.  There was water everywhere.  So I went to bed a little while later, got up early this morning for sunday school and then just a few minutes ago, I went out to assess the damage on my car, so I grabbed some towels and a broom and had to sweep all the darn leaves off (my goodness, there were a lot) and then I could finally actually see my car!!!  Only to find that there are tons of little dents everywhere.  :*(   My mom felt bad, but there was nothing we could’ve done about it.  Ohhhhhh well.  Today’s gonna be a pretty lazy day- just church and homework.  Hopefully I can get some sleep since I haven’t gotten much at all this weekend.  Plus sectionals tomorrow : (  *sigh*  IS SCHOOL AMOST OVER?!?!??!?!  I can’t take much more of it.  Cool song alert!  Evanescence – “Going Under”  That’s all for now!  Until next time.....
