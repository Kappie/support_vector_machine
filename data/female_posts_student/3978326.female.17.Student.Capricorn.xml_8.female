These impertinent mutts with unwarranted fury always seem to be on their heels, flushing their anger at the wrong direction. Which ever way you see it, they suffer nothing in turn of their despicable character, unless you count all those irritance emancipating out of the pores of their previous victims.  Well, to those who haven't meet a dog with ultra-sensitive smell reseptors on their smooth, black nostrils, you might be suprised that you can actually find them anywhere. Not only do they guard houses owned by sufferers of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder, in terms of security in this case), but, thanks to this era of globalization, they can be found even in office premises....  That brings me to the discussion of the day...  Has anyone been to the Centre of Pre-University Studies staff office without getting clearance from the dedicated 'watchman' (in this case, our security guard in question has to be promoted)? Then again, the bigger question is why do students need clearance to meet mentors, their only guide in the seemingly never ending bower of dreary theoretical facts. However unrelevent all these facts are in the real world, students need all these facts to get pass this hurdle. This hurdle of course starts with a mere height of a millimeter to the height where only the   escape speed   can take you....(  the minimum speed required by a space craft to escape the earths' gravitational   field  )  Back to my point, since this 'watchman' is after all human, it is not exempted from partiality. Well...let me put it this way, if you throw a big, fat, juicy bone to a dog, it would most certainly lick you, but if you were to step on its tail, you'll be visiting your local doctor for your rabies vaccine injections........  Thus, students tend to give various accounts of the accountability of the security system in this little secluded office.   "Who? Oh 'watchman'? Well I'm mostly lucky. It's always busy when I walk in. Like the other day it was having a bone wedged between its paws and its ears, muttering non-stop in a highly serious manner. So I simply mouthed the name of my lecturer to it and with the wagging of its tail, allowed me enterence to it's lair..."  "Gosh, don't remind me. Why is it so difficult to let us in? We can't be giving away bones all the time. All I needed to do was to put the book on my lecturers' table. But it went on barking, denying me entrance...."  "Apply Newton's Third Law lah my friend. To every action there is a reaction. I just walk in equiped with a bag of fresh chicken bones for its inspection. I mean, you need to apply the psychology of the 'opposite-sex' to get your way sometimes.......in your case, it can't be applied..."  "It let you in without having a bite of your flesh? That's not fair at all! **ry, **ry, what a contrary!"  "Of course it won't let you in, you didn't pay your fees for the next semester right. Your friend did, that's why it was sniffing her instead of you..."    Examples shown, it would be pointless to go on. Remember, if you venture to the staff room in the fourth floor, you have been forwarned!
