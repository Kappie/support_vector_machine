Boy, was I shocked to click on your name and see the novel you had written since the smelly poo incident. One thing though. It's not a comma!! It's an apostrophe. I think I was having a"dumb" day.It's a day unlike any other. It only comes, like,once a weekor so. So, I don't really know anything about comma's but I know when to use an apostrophe...sometimes.  But mike. Let's talk about you. Do you think that because I use a lowercase 'm' when writing your name, (good comma, bad comma?) I think little of you? I don't. I just don't like taking the time to hit the shift key, hold it and then hit the m key. I'm lazy. But back to you... is heather pregnant yet? Is she? Is she? Is she? Hm... You know, mike,you don't lead a very interesting life. I mean, you work. And then you goto church. That's about it. See where the lack ofinteresting is?Tell us about youmike!!!You can't just comment. You have topost something. If you like I can make up an interesting story about you and heather.What'cha think??
