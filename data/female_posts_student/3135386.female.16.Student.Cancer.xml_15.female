Not horrible, but I thought it would have been a lot better. In toronto, I met up with the other exchangers. I didn´t reconize them (they weren´t wearing their jackets) and they didñ´t come up to me. Fine. I guessed who they were in Miami, and found out, at least one of them was such a bitch!! Geez...Miami was the shocker. Nobody spoke english. We were expecting it in brasil of course, but Miami?!? Nope, english is a minority language. They speak spanish, or portuguese there...on the plane from my Miami to Sao Paulo, I sat next to the camel man. More about that when I get home. He didn~t shut up! Even when I fell asleep, I bet he was still talking. He asked for my e-mail be for we got off, so I gave him my old account, which I never check. *shrugs* Isn´t it a bit wierd, a 50 yr old asking for my e-mail? *shifty glance*   I´ve been here four days now and I haven´t been home to sleep before 1:30 am. My first day here, we went touring around florianopolis and then Maju and I went to a Festa de Juinia party at friend´s of Maju´s. All the guys (very cute, i might add) were teaching me english, and how to dance, and everyone was dressed up (it´s kind of like halloween, except people all dress up as peasants)....I had so much fun!   The next day we went to another Festa de Juinia party, this one in the counrty, about 40 minutes away, at her relatives place. After, Maju, Carlos and I went to see Shrek 2. They thought it was going to be dubed in portuguese, and subbed in english, or vise versa, but either way, it was~´t, and so I sat through the complete portuguese version of shrek. *grins* I must say, even with out hardly understanding a word, it was better then the first. After that, we went out for sushiu. Real sushi. I loved it! I didn´t realise how late everything´s open until here, until we got home at 2 am....@_@   The next day (yesterday) was a rotary BBQ, where I met all the other exchangers. (most of them long term) I mainly hung out with three australians, two americans, and a south african boy...I had so much fun with them (and finally, people who had english as a native language) after the BBQ, Maju and I went to another one of her friends, and we watched movies (in english, they had portuguese subs on)   Today, to my horror i slept in until 11am! We did some errands around the town, and then at 6pm went shopping. I bought a new pair of jeans, and a shirt as well. I still can't get over how cheap everything is here!!  I also got invited today to go to school for a couple hours with one of the girls I met yesterday. (She´s a brazilian girl, going to Mexico in august) I was so surprised to get the phone call, we exchanged phone numbers with several people yesterday, but I didn´t expect anyone to actually call me!   Anyway, it´s late here. I´m tired, and really homesick I think. I really mis all my friends, and Dime and my parents...I really wish I could go home, just for the night to see them, and give them all hugs.   I´m having fun here, but...it´s not the same with out them. It´s so overwhelming!   Anyway, I´ll write more soon.   Tchau!
