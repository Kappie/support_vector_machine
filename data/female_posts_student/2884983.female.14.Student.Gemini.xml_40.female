I am so tired of getting yelled at for telling the truth and trying to help. so I am just going to stop. I dont know how long I will be able to but we'll see. aahh....garr...sometimes it makes me so mad. we are killing the earth and each other, this world is being controlled by money and power hungry bastards that make me want to stab my self with rusty spoons. argh....GAAAR!! i desperatly need a punching bag.  Goddess Bless.
