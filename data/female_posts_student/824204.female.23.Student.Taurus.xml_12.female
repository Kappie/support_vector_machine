Its just that, there would be times when my mind would drift and tears would slowly just start pouring down, and I'm not sure I should be feeling that way. I'm not sure if I'm still allowed to feel like that.        You know what sucks? That feeling when you KNOW someone is intentionally avoiding you, or doesn't want to see you. I've never really been in that situation, at least not when its done intentionally, until recently. It just hurts, to think that someone you used to spend everyday and every night with doesn't even want to look at you. Yet you can't help but see this person, even for just a moment. It is so hard to let go, its so hard to think that "the one I gave my heart to" has the power to make me feel so damn bad. It's only been a few months, yet I feel like this hurt I'm feeling is never gonna go away.       More than half of the time I would say that I'm really OKAY, but then there's those times at night when I sit in the dark and just start to cry.... I don't know why, sometimes I wish I wasn't so damn emotional!! It's such a fault! Nakakainis!
