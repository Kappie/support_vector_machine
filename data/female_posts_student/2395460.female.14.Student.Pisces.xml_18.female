It makes me think of the exquisite burgundy silk cheongsam that  urlLink Kirsten Dunst  wore in the first  Spiderman . Kirsten looked lovely but if I put on a cheongsam I'd look like I just clocked out of my shift as a hostess at the  Golden Dragon . I might have to stick with one of these silk cell phone bags. They're the perfect size for just the absolute essentials: cell phone, credit card, and a lipstick. Just a few bucks each, so you can buy one in every color.  Available at  urlLink Pearl River  (although their online store is currently sold out.)  Also at  urlLink Teenage Dope Slave , a cool shop full of vintage clothing and accessories, not an online opium den.
