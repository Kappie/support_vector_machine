I wake up, take a bath, eat breakfast, leave for school, wait till the awaiting doors of our classroom open.  we waited for a while and soon boarded the bus.  the next thing i knew was i was standing an alley with a muddy ground...sun shining so brightly that we were sweating right away, the scorching heat...houses that are crowded and can barely holda population quite large, but it seems they still can manage to keep it as their ownhome. So...this is the  real world.      So i have been living in the dream world...not quite...  We were directed through an alley and we shortly found our foster families.   I, Steph and Vicky were assigned to  Nanay Cynthia . She was a very low-toned woman. She's a mother of 3 children. Ate Rochelle, 14 yrs old, 3rd yr hs. Charlo, grd 3 and little Ryan, 3 years old.  as we went inside their home, i wasn't more surprised...not that im criticizing them, but its the fact of life, it was a house (more of a "barung-barong"), crammed house...but still it was a home to them.  Nanay Cynthia  said sorry for their house's condition and told them the street was being reconstructed and their old house was on the way, so the gov't had to demolish their home.  yes...it was their way of life, no assured home...can be demolished by any higher official...they were used to that way of life...they could not complain... they just follow the authorities...but i guess its for their own good...(?).     back to reality..oops, this is reality.  we were offered a chair, actually, sa kahirapan nang buhay it was a plastic monobloc kiddie chair. They had a small dining table. It wasnt really a dining table, it was more of a study table good for 3 year old kids... yes...that is how hard life is in there...  we were introduced to Charlo, Ate Rochelle and Ryan.  We gave away the coloring book sand activity puzzles we bought for the kids. oh boy! when they saw it, their faces immediately had a big grin!...i never knew coloring books were so fascinating and a good find. well, for these children, it was their treasure...indeed... another man's trash is another man's treasure.     tbc. in part 2. too long..sorry. :)  Lari
