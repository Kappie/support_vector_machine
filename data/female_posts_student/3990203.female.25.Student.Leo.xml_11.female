I had a really good day yesterday in Arisage as the weather was sunny and we had two caravan site inspections to do. The weather makes a big difference when you have to work outside.  the day before that I was in a hotel with Mark doing a kitchen inspection and the guy actually remembered me from when I was there in 1999, god we must be scary for him to remember me from so long ago!!  I'm just planning on chilling this weekend and sleeping!! Although Chris is home on Sunday so may do something.  How are you all doing ? Iv not herd from a few of you in a while!!
