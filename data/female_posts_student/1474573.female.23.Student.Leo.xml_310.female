I've wanted this for a long time.  Saw them in Amish Country (around Lancaster, PA) and they were well made and relatively cheap.  We bought a house with a porch where it would look so inviting.  We would not be able to fit one of those things in the car.  Steve PROMISED he'd get me one.  So we searched on the Internet, searched around NJ and everything we saw was either poorly made or cost too much.  So we decided to go back to Pennsylvania with a larger car and get real deal.  Getting the larger car however, was tricky.  It meant driving out to Long Island to get my sister-in-law's minivan.  We had to go there (about 75 miles away) on Friday night, drop off our car, take theirs, drive to PA in the morning (about 160 miles away), get the glider, drive back home, drop off the glider, then go back out to LI and come back home.  Oh, and yes, we got stuck in traffic through most of the 300 miles back and forth in LI.  It was not fun.  BUT, I have a glider, baybeeee!!  I even stenciled a nice design on it.  I love that thing.  Its the best!  I have the best friggin' husband in the world!!  He ALWAYS comes through for me.  (gush, gush)  Anyway, onto other things.  Wait a minute, there arent any other things.  Its all about the glider.
