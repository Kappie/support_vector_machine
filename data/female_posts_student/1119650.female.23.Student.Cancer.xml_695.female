Wow.  Anyhow, Blink were very funny, very good,  Travis is TOTALLY insane, but there were some akward moments when they started to play some old stuff (and by old stuff I only mean pre-Enema of the State) and they cut out to let the crowd sing and most of the teenyboppers there didn't know the words.  It was a little cringeworthy to say the least.  Also: I'm not exaggerating there must have been about 200+ people there (guys and girls mixed) in BRIGHT PINK blink trucker caps  VonDutch (or VonBitch) shirts.  Seriously, I hate them all and wish scorching cases of the clap for all of them.   Also I'm making a mental note to self:  Kill Ashton Kutcher, he really annoys the everlivingpiss out of me.   No Doubt was acutally really good, they played almost entirely singles, but there were a few old school songs, and I am absolutely enamoured/obsessed with/need to be Gwen Stefani.  Seriously, she fucking kicks ass.  The seats were pretty great **BIG UPS TO ONE BROWN EYED HANK FOR THE TIX!!** and it was a fun time, even if I was awash in a sea of 8th Grade Puberty Love.  It was a fun way to kick of my summer of concerts.   I used to go to shows religiously and I haven't been to one in ages, well, except last summer, but before that it had been like 2+ years.    The rest of the summer concert line up is as follows: June 24: *possibly* (I'm still looking for peeps to go with) Reel Big Fish at Roseland Ballroom June 26: Dashboard Confessional/Thrice/The Get Up Kids at PNC July: The Roots/311 at PNC August 7 or 8: Warped Tour (still finalizing) August 18: Maroon 5/John Mayer at Jones Beach  and a few others which are TBA.  Yeah, so I'm a huge teenybopper/lameass/whatever you wanna call me, but screw you guys I like these bands so eat my butt!    Tonight there is a school benefit with a $20K raffle and open bar that I'll be attending with the lovely OBE Hank, The Future Mrs. OBE Hank, Reg, an assasinated senator and a few others.  Needless to say some sort of debauchery will ensue (photos to come).  The rest of my weekend will probably be spend recouping from Friday, but if you wanna hang out hit me up, no promises, but if I can move: I'll be there.     24 shopping days left until my birthday, hoes.  I love you all so dearly and since my last 2 birthdays ended disastrously I expect some of you to help me kick some ass this year.   I've been a little under the weather the last few days, today being no exception, but I'm trying to make the best of it.  I'm getting better daily at driving stick and I'm averaging 21 miles to the gallon, w00t.  Um...thats really all thats been exciting thats been going on with me.  So I guess I'll end it here.  Oh!  I almost forgot:  CONGRATULATIONS TO: Ian  Katie on the birth of their first child, a son: Rowan Daniel on May 17, 2004 (daddy  baby have the same birthday (c:  ) Andy  Jess on the Birth of their first child, a daughter: Juliet  who was born Tuesday or Wednesday June 1st or 2nd.  (I said it before, I'll say it again...June babies are the best babies!) Happy Belated Birthday to K.C.
