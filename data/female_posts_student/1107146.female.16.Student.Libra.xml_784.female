They have really nice people to help out over there, they didn't do the whole "awwww how CUTE!" thing, they didn't judge by the black nailpolish (the doorguard did, then dropped it pretty quick, I think someone gave him a lash of a glance or something)...yeah man. It really wasn't a whole lot. I'm serious. Well, yes, if you knew, Abby wouldn't be the only one killing me, from a cursory personality analysis.   Yes, I am damned insane, but I tried all the other places and didn't find anything I liked. Maybe I'll just scrap the boxes and leave the necklace in the jewelery box or whatnot? I dunno. And I still don't know what to do after "phase A." I've had some ideas, but eh.  I've known since I had the thought to even get the sucker in the first place from where I did, but wanted to make this all something special, because I love her. I may die, but it was all worth it. Heheh.  It's the least I could have done. Eh. I just hope she takes it and doesn't barf on my shoes and run home crying or something. And after "phase A," I'm not counting that out of the possibility spectrum. Heh, 'k not really.  Yazoo.
