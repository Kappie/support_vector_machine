And you don't know how much that comment meant to me...But it left me speechless. Hun, I really do like you A LOT. And after thinking for a day I know what I wish I could have said...     John...I really do care about you a lot. And liking you is something i never thought i would feel, but its also something that I'm happy for this summer. When i talk to you, its like nothing i have ever dreamt of before. Your voice is just so...sexy. I would stay on the phone all day just to hear your voice, and even with our awkward silences just hearing you breathe puts a smile on my face. Your always on my mind, and in my dreams when I go to sleep. And when you asked what reminded me of you, I just wanted to say everything. Everywhere I go, Every song I listen to, Everything I do...It makes me think of you. I can't stop thinking about you. Being with you is so awesome. When we went out on Friday, I never wanted that night to end. And I wish that we could be together even more because every minute away from you is torture. And I really do care about you a lot  I don't want to lose you ever. And after thinking, I do realize that those 3 words are serious, and I guess I don't feel that way yet. Its just that what you do to me is so...Indescribable...and a simple crush just doesn't do it. I know its more then a little crush but love IS rushing it. But I just really really like you a lot. Your so perfect to me. Every little thing about you. I wouldn't change anything about you. I hope that we can get to know each other even more.
