Ok, we went the beach the first day and all four of us were horrifically sunburned... we're peeling and blisterin all over the place. So... now we are all four here now, so we're gonna say some cool stuff...   Well, It's rained for the past 2 days, and we have not started said documentary yet... we have had several encounters with boys, but none of them seem to like me.  They always fall for Natalie (most of the time) or Phileda, and I am surprised to say that Virginia hasn't really had them falling all over her... she's so pretty i would expect them to.  Anyways, I don't think it's that important anyway because I mean, boys might seem important now, but in the long run, the only thing that matters is that we have a blast!  Which at the moment, I am succeeding fabulously!  So, I guess all is good on the Tantiginous Donut.    I am very tired because we have been getting up early to either go running or meet boys at 8:30 in the morning (throw's hairbrush at Phileda).  I plan on sleeping late tomorrow morning, ahem, no matter what.  Well, I'm sure my lovely girlies can think of ways to get me out of bed, but I'm so so sure that it would be incredibly incredibly hard to do... see? I'm rambling on like a crazy woman! This is a sign of tiredness...  So the sun finally came out today!  We went the the pool and further developed our sunburns... i mean... uh... TANS... we are... TAN i promise... well, its all good.  it will turn into tan, but im just scare of becoming one of those gross 50 year old ladies with really gross leathery/cancery looking skin... so i make sure to apply SPF 30 everyday, even though it has given me sun poisoning in the past andmy dermo in atlanta told me not to do it, but i really dont wanna get too much more badly burned... and im not breaking out it itchy red bumps so i dont have sun poisoning, so ive decided that my dermo was wrong... WHOA im going way off subject...  So seaside has rocked my socks off so far, and its so exciting that its so much fun!  we actually go up to talk to boys this year instead of just watching them and giggling... oh we were so silly!  well, I'll talk to all you cool people later... i have some serious dinner to eat!    You know I'm worth it!  -Jilly
