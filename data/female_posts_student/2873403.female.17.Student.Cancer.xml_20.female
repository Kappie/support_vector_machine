Oh here's some news:   So Friday, I walk into the locker room after school to get ready for practice, and there is a crowd of girls standing around 2 pieces of paper taped to the wall. All of these girls are lacrosse players, and some of them are crying, so we know what these papers were. THE LIST. So I mosey on over to find out what's going on. The first page had a list of names under  Varsity  and a second list of names under  JV Regular . Then the second page was entitled  "JV Foaters"  (we figured out it was supposed to say "Floaters") then under this was Group A and B. Under Group A was about 6 names, and then a different list of names under Group B. We were/are really confused about this. So anyway, I look on the regular JV list first just to be safe. And holy ball sack, guess what the first name on the list is! Yeah it looked something like this (with my added little side comments):   JV Regulars  1. Danielle Enman (Yes that's right, me... starting JV... bleh) 2. Nicole Gagliostro (What the gay? That upsets me more than seeing my own name on this list.) .blah .blah .blah .some random names including Hilary, Cole, and others 11. Kristen Oyen (crazy sometimes-goalie-kid) 12. Amy Spoer (my Spoergasmo! yay! Damn goalie bitch :-D) 13>Elaine Kubik (yes with that exact typo) The End. I forget who was 3-10. No biggy.  It was slightly retarded. So then I looked on the Varsity list, which had 20 people on it. It was Kendahl (obviously), Lauren Brierly (yay), Noel, Shell Promnitz (yay), Taren, Marissa (whhhhaaaat???? Ouch.), Allie ( :( My bench bitch wont be sharing the bench with me anymore:( ), and Kelly (yeeeahhh....). Then there's some other random people that I really don't care about. And then there's Linda. It comes as no surprise that Linda's on varsity, because, well, Linda's awesome. The rest of this list was bullshit. Oh well.  Then this Floaters list. Apparently, its mostly just the people that would have gotten cut but since someone's a pushover and didn't want to make cuts, we ended up with this floater list. The people in these group alternate between games. Group A plays one game and Group B plays in the next. The JV Regulars will play/ start in every JV game, and some will be moved up to varsity. And honestly? I think this system sucks.  Oh yeah so Friday, Phil was allowed to come back to school, which made me very happy. So happy, in fact, that I jumped on him in the hall after lunch and gave him quite a dramatic kiss on the cheek, and people looked at me weird. :-D  Oh well. Friday night, I was waiting around for Nick to come over, and Chris Korwan decided to stop by, and ended up staying the whole night. So it was me, Nick, Chris, and Steve, eating frozen french fries, wrestling on the trampoline, and watching Ferngully. Chris was all with Steve, which was... creepy... to say the least. So then blah blah blah, random things went on, blah blah blah. The end. :-D Oh yeah Steve kicked me really hard it the back and it still hurts a lot.  Yesterday I had to get up and go to my lacrosse scrimmage in Millburn. It sucked. But me and Amy ate mac and cheese on the way there, because we're awesome like that. It was really cold out. It sucked. On the way home I saw a house with a lot of lawn flamingos in the backyard. I'm jealous.  So then I went home and slept, and then at 7-something, Meagan's all like "Hey, lets go to the movies." So we did. We wandered around the mall for a while before the movie (50 First Dates) started. We went to Hot Topic and bought shoelaces, and there was all Family Guy stuff everywhere and I was like, I should get something for James, seeing how he's obsessed with Family Guy. But I didn't. So then we wandered into H why I'm not sure, but it was fun. I tried on this crazy ugly poofy black and red skirt with a red and white striped shirt. It was great. Then I made Meag buy a blue plaid skirt. We got in this big music discussion with the cashier guy. It was strange. On the way back to the movie theater, we ran into Britt, Adam, and Stasha. That was strange too. So then we went and saw the movie and it was ok, then we drove home blasting various random punk. It was fun. Then I got home at like 12:30, and started watching "Pieces of April" (which kind of sucked by the way) before passing out.   As for today, I have not accomplished a single thing other than cutting up my Finch shirt and digging an old shirt out of the back of my closet and cutting fuzzies off of it for like an hour.   Good times.
