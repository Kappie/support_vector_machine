I knew the blisters were lurking but I thought it would work like my nose and just start peeling. I didn't think the blisters would come to the surface, or something. That was pretty stupid. It started peeling last night in some of the areas that hadn't been BADLY burned, but today, when I got back from being all nice and sweaty at guard, my upper arms, collarbone, cleavage, shoulderblades, and upper back were all bubble wrap. The blisters have stuff inside them, I discovered that at the same time I discovered the blisters. I went to fix my bra strap and popped like three of them, I thought I'd spilled something until I went to change clothes. And the area that was peeling before the blisters is now rashy red. Nice.  I got my first paycheck today. $70.05. Not bad, considering it's for only like 15 hours. OK, you're right, McDonald's is a bunch of cheap bastards, but money's money. I thought I'd have enough to pay for my contacts and have fifty left over, but they pay you for the work you did a month ago. So I'll be getting a 70 dollar paycheck every two weeks from now on. Just working one day a week, 8 hours. My mom and stepdad are paying for half my contacts, so I can afford them with 10 dollars left over, oh joy. I need to call my dad back and confirm that he's also sending money. I can use my money on contacts and his on clothes. I forgot to call him the other day, I SHOULD do it now. But I won't. Lauren's first on my call list, and I'm waiting for HER to call ME, because she's always busy. Anyway, if I tell him I'm using his on school clothes, he'll send more. That's just how it works.  I spent a good part of my day reading Maddox. I don't know why. It's not like he has anything to say that I can't get anywhere else on the internet, AND he pretends he's a pirate. Woo. Party. We got a Delia's catolog in the mail. Actually, it was addressed to my mother, but she gave it to me so I can buy overpriced clothes online. Yay? I'm thinking about signing up for the arts and crafts portion of the county fair, all entries are due Saturday. I don't think I have anything good enough, but you never know. My crochetting sucks, but I think I could be entered in the teen category and kick some ass. Why? Because there aren't any other crochetting teens in my county would consider entering. I'm the Craft Diva and they know it.  Janet was online for all of fifteen minutes today, but it was still great to talk to her. She won't have internet full-time until SEPTEMBER 6, when she's in college. Tara's moving into her dorm today. I miss her already. We had a big fight last night. I apparently make her so mad she wants to strangle something. Over the internet. She only said fuck about a million times. I cracked up laughing, and told her that...she only got madder. It's HER problem if she lets some internet chick get to her that badly. All because I care about her enough to not want her to move. Although if I REALLY cared about her, I'd want her to do what makes her happy, even if it means we'd never talk again. I hate loops.  Oh, and the carwash Peggy got us at WALMART is cancelled. Lesson: don't trust Peggy. She hasn't come through on ANYTHING so far, and she damned annoying.  Tara just came online, didn't say anything to me, and left to watch gymnastics with somebody named Bridget. Seriously, when will people learn that I'm usually right about these sorts of things?  I will now go back to my miserable existance of waiting for phone calls that will never come, pretending I have a life, and procrastinating. (Overused punchline:"...or, I could do it later.")
