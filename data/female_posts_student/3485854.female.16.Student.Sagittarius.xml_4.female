I really don't want to bring her down. I guess it's a good thing I have to work tomorrow so that I don't have to think about my father's death until i get ome. Maybe I can avoid it all together. It took every bit of will power i had not to cry when picking out cards for my grandpa and my mom's boyfriend. I go through this every year and I hate, I hate it so much. But I suppose I'll get through, just as I do every year, every birthday, and every holiday. I was glad to pick out a card for him though, because he has done so much for us already. We're moving into a new house thanks to him, and he's made mom so happy. I guess I can't compain. I just wish holidays and stuff were easier. Anyone else who can sympathize through the death of a father or anyone else close like that for that for that matter, comment or e-mail me, maybe we can help eachother through tomorrow. Well, I went out with Danny after he got back. Come to find out he did try to call me, but mom apologized because she made me pissed of at him because she forgot to tell me. It's all better i guess. I guess we'll see how it goes over the summer.  Speaking of summer, I promised the familyi would take them to Holday World, not the chech I get the 29th but the one I get one the 13th. If I take any pics I might post them, along with one of me, finally. If there is anyone who think they might be scared away and say I shouldn't....TOOOO BAD!!!!...lol.  Well, since i've neglected my blog for a while now, I'll give you guys a longer joke to read...enjoy. ~Joke for Today~  Ouch  Joe, a successful man by most standards, began to be bothered by some incredible headaches.   When both his professional life and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who claimed he could solve the problem.   "The good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to  remove the testicles," said the doctor.   Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to accept the operation.   He left the hospital wearing a diaper under his clothing, but his mind was clear and no headache.   As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He decided then and there that he could make a new beginning and live a more fulfilling life.   As he walked past a men's clothing store, he thought,"That's what I need, a new suit." Joe entered the shop and told the salesman: "I'd like to see some of your suits."   The salesman eyed him briefly and said, "Let's see . . . size 44 long."   Joe laughed, "That's right, how did you know?"   "It's my job," replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit and it fit perfectly.   As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, "How about a new shirt?"   Joe thought for a moment and said, "Sure . . "   The salesman eyed Joe and said, "Let's see . . . .34 sleeve and 17 neck."  Joe was surprised, "That's right, how did you know?"   It's my job," said the salesman. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly.   As Joe looked in the mirror and adjusted the collar, the salesman asked, "How about new shoes?"   Joe was on a roll, so he said, "Sure . . . "   The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, "Let's see. . 9 Wide."   Joe was astonished, "That's right, how did you know?"   "It's my job," said the salesman. Joe was feeling great, when the salesman asked, "How about some new underwear?"   Joe thought for a second, and said, "Sure . . . "   The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, "Let's see ... size 36." Joe laughed and said, "No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."   The salesman shook his head and said, "You shouldn't wear a size 34. Eventually it will press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache."
