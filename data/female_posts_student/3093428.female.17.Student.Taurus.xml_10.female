I can't remember how but it was soooooooo funny!  Anywho, when your tired, everything seems extra long. While walking to No 3 I thought I was there, I wasn't even half way!!! Everything seemed to crawl!!! I was like, oh well, 7:30 in the morning on a Saturday, I'll have the B Line to myself!. YEAH RITE! It was full!!! Where are people going at this time? It's a Saturday!! Sleep in! The walk from 70th to my house was even worse, because I just wanted to be home, NOW!  I got home and I closed all the blinds and curtains in my house and turned my living room into my bed room. I couldn't really sleep so I brouth the PS2 up, yes I wasn't sick of it yet, and played a game of hockey. Sure enough, it worked! I went right to sleep and woke up at 4! It was a great sleep!  So now I sit at home with nothing to do because I don't want to call others yet because they might still be sleeping. Anywho, if your bored, call me, or message me, anything!  Attention JC and fellow Bloggers! I propose lunch at my house Sunday after church! It would be fun! My nice cozy house all to ourselves and I could cook! Haha! yeah right. But if interested, let me know!
