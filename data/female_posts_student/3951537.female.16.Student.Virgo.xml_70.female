She decides to make a list of the things that make her happy. She writes 'plum-blossom' at the top of a piece of paper. Then she stares at the paper, unable to think of anything else. Eventually it begins to get dark.                          --Despair, 15 Portraits of Despair  SERGEI: The people in the city seem paper thin in the mist. They believe they are dancing to the music of their lives... But I think, like the puppets, each of us is pulled upon invisible strings, until the night comes and we are put away. I shiver, and hurry from the square, as the darkness of the city closes over me like canal water or the grave.                           --Death, Death and Venice  I have heard the language of apocalypse, and now I shall embrace the silence                           --Despair, 15 Portraits of Despair  talk about a weird series.  sandman, i mean.  neil gaiman.  good writer.  read neverwhere if you haven't.  okay, i'm ignoring this.  i won't trouble you with disturbing quotes.  generation terrorists has good quotes though.  night.
