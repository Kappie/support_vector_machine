She went to some civil war sites and she'll be going to some more during this week. She's also going to see the musical 'Chicago'!!!!! in NY and she's going to try to go to the Today show on wednesday morning, so if you know her...look out for her lol. Lets see, she'll also be going by the Mtv studios and stuff like that, she's also going to the 9/11 memorial which is cool. I'm glad she called too, i just havent talked to anyone lately. while she's having a wonderful time in NJ tomarrow i will be helping out with a garage sale. Fun. No it frikkin sucks! I do not wanna be in the sun all day, (its more of a yard sale) mom just had to get me into it, and its not even out sale, its one of our neighbors'. why does life need to suck this much? I need something fun todo. like IOA, i'll be going there again soon. yay! So right now im listening to Something Corporate, their album is so pretty. Oh ya and the Vans Warped Tour '04 is going to be taking place tomarrow in St. Petersburg which is really close to here, but im not going, its like 30 dollars a person, but hey theres always next year. Ok well thanks for reading my 'exciting' post.
