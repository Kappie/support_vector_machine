I know, I focus on semantics too much, but this is a truly perplexing weather forecast. If it is raining, then how do we differentiate rain from a shower? Is there a meteorological phenomenon known as a 'shower'?  Whatever it means, I expect tomorrow to be wet, with intermittent spells of wet, followed perhaps, by more wet.
