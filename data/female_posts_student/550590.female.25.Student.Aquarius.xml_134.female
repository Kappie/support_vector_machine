I swear I saw video footage of Shawn Werner in camp in the middle east...but overall I wish the troops well.  Go USA!   ~D~ PS: People who are still wasting their breath protesting at this point are just plain obnoxious. Go over there and take the place of the Iraqi citizens that Saddam is forcing to act as human shields in order to protect his weapons of mass destruction.
