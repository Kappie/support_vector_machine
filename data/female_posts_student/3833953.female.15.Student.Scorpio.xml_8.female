Got up this morning because my brother woke me up. (how nice of him -_-) Not sure when that was...I think it was just alittle before 9 this morning. He can be a jerk sometimes..ok.. a lot..but i still love him as a big brother. He doesn't realize that he is my roll modle. Anyway, I got up and had a bit to eat and went outside where my mom told me to feed the animals...gerr I hate doing that. It got done reguardless. Later my sister's friend came over to stock us up on some pop and whatnot for the 4th tomorrow. I was confuzed and thought that she was going to be over tonight to do fire work stuff with us and all...but i thought wrong apparantly, and I supose we'll be doing that tomorrow night then, since tomorrow is officially July 4th :p     My sister's friends are over tonight, Brandy and Aaron. I have no clue what they are doing as far as if they are going to have a bonfire tonight or what. Reguardless I'm sure it will be just as boring as any other bonfire that is usually here. I usually end up being the slave then,  getting the food and stuff and dragging it out back, chairs, setting up the table, all that good stuff...and I dont seem to get a thanks. It sucks being the youngest.   As for the Brandy and Aaron thing, my brother Tom (the one that woke me up) was just plain rude to them, or atleast Aaron. Tom was working on his usualy computer stuff, and getting frustraited when Aaron glanced over at his work on the computer and stuff, and Tom is like "dont touch my computer!"....in my opinion, Tom has got some seriouse issues to work on with his people skills. Hes like that all the time..but to a guest? Thats just plain wrong! following this, Tom went out into our patio room and slammed the kitchen window shut..he has an anger issue with hearing people when hes doing something. anyway, when he did this in his anger he knocked down one of my mothers little snow globes that was sitting on the window ledge and broke it. He was too busy webcamming with someone so I didnt want to be rude and interupt him, unlike him who must come barging in on whomever he likes and getting an attitude, so i went on AIM and told him he had broke it..he didnt give a sh*t..just said "i was f****** SICK of hearing you!"..God sometimes i want to kill him......but i still love him as a brother. Im stuck with him so i have to deal with it.   It was about that time that my mom and sister walked in. I told my mom that Tom was having an additude and being rude...i was upset about his comment about the sick of hearing me...I was about to send im a IM tleling him that i was P'd off at him. Of course my mom saw it, and had not been there to witness what Tom was doing..She told me to settle down, i mouthed off at her because i was upset and told her to tell Tom that. she told me to stop..i was angry and i had never done this to my brother before, telling him what i honestly felt so i just ignored her and continued my typing. she threatend to unplug the computer, i told her what she knew was true "you know how he acts..you know that you want it to stop too" she paused for a second, i could tell i had hit her where it hurt, the "you know what, she right..and i dont like it" spot. Anyway, it ended up that she yelled at me...for what Tom had done..once again taking the blow of what others do. its amazing how that works here..or anywhere im sure.. you know what, if it ends up that there is proof at this house that i didnt do something its just a big F****** mystery about who did it..and a lot of the time its not me, but since im available, its my blame. Like i said, it sucks being the youngest. After i went to my room and slammed the door in anger, i started thinking and stuff..I wanted some way to write down things, like a journal, which i have but it takes way too long to write as oppose to typing so i decided to start a blog..so here it is and there you go. ...If you cant tell.. im one to make a novel out of one days happenings..but since today was the first day to do this i had a lot on my mind...whenever i next update, i dont think it will be as long..  well, cya  -Rachel  aka "The Fledgling Phoenix" aka Phoenix aka WingNut (Wnut) aka Spirit White Wolf (SWW) aka Risk Taker (RT) aka Light Of The Stars (LOTS)  (yup..that sould about do it for nick names :p)  Later!
