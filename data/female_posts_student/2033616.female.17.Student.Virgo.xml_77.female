Take me in your arms, my love Never let me go You safety wrapped around me Your presence seems to grow  Now you hold me as your sweetheart Because you promised me one thing You would never wish to hurt nor harm The heart of my being  Teach me what it means to love To fully trust you To firstly trust, my God above I want the spirit that's in you  I do not know if I can trust Enough to never cry Enough to never feel alone Or be suspicious of a lie  Show me that He'll always be The only man for me That you are just a living proof Of love, eternally  For this love between You and I, is not based on us But rather we are followers Faithful in God we trust  I ask you now, please lead me down The path to sanctity And show how YOU have grown to be A living child for Thee  I wish to live to praise the name Of He who sent you me Who brought you here so we could be One with heavenâ€™s three  Teach me how to love  Unconditionally So I will never fail you Nor worse my God mighty.
