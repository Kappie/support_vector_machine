Must be hanging around the poofs too much. Which reminds me, Andy's got a new fella who I spoke to on the phone the other night and he sounds  lovely . Gonna go and meet him on Sunday methinks.  Yeah, so music. I'm still loving all my dykey indie and old stuff though. Liking Motown stuff at the moment, especially Jackson 5 and Stevie Wonder.   I took a Sociology exam today, it went pretty averagely I think, you can never tell though can you?! We shall see... no exams for a week and a bit now, and I swear to God I'm going to get my arse in gear and revise properly for History and Spanish!   I spoke to Sarah before, we're gonna go and get pretty drunk on Saturday, which should be interesting as I'm meeting up with the QYA gang that night too... David, Michael, possibly Nadine  Katie and maybe RiotGrrl, HoobaciousPixie (who is rather fit!) and a few others too. That could go either way really. I will most probably want to spend all night with Sarah and James, if he's there. Which could make me eager to leave the QYA gathering, which I don't want to be apparent cos I actually really like everyone. Hmm. Not sure the QYA lot will mix well with Sarah and James. Especially if Nikki, David and Carlos are there. Oh well, let's just see what happens shall we?  My little sister has just got home in tears, she says she's being bullied by her whole form at school. I remember what that feels like and I really do feel for her and want to help. The trouble is I know how arrogant and cocky she  can  be... Just a bit brash and loud really and I think that could get her into trouble.   Another thing today, after the exam I went into Bolton and bumped into  so  many people... Suzanne, Danny Fay, Gem, Rachel Scudder, Vicky, Harriet, Leanne, Alex, Clare Gaffney (who talked for ages!), Clare Bleasedale and some other year 10s on work experience. It was nice really, just chatting randomly to everyone. Isn't it funny how easily you can talk sometimes... yet other times I find it really difficult to keep the conversation flowing. I was speaking to this girl on the net today (katieactually) and she was really easy to talk to... we were chatting about Python hehe. When I think of people who I can chat forever to, I can't help but think of Katherine. We get on so well it's not funny! Michael reckons there is a lot of sexual tension there which might possibly be true! Shame she lives so far away eh?   Right, enough... I'm sure I have better things to do. :)   xx
