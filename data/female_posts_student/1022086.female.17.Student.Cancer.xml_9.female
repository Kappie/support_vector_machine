I sense another bad grade coming my way (quiz tomorrow). Of course, the Oxford Traditions people are being ever-so-horrid and making my application nearly impossible, and I am so mad at them for the email that I received today that I am considering not attending their stupid program after all. Of course, I go to my room to get some things that I'd left in certain places, and *poof* everything's gone. I suppose that either a) my papers magically sprang legs and left    or b) someone moved my stuff which is very likely, though no one will admit the crime. All sorts of applications and junk that I need to do and learn and understand and bleah are just driving me insane.  Calculus is frustrating me beyond belief; I keep losing points because of stupid, tiny mistakes. I'm not even sure my grade in there is an A anymore.   In light of recent events, I realize that there is a possibility of my having to take the TOEFL. It is a test given to foreign students to prove they're stupid and cannot proceed in their studies, normally administered by Satan (the College Board). Fortunately, many are able to prove Satan incorrect. Although I know it would likely be no biggie for me to pass this test as I think I possess a decent English vocabulary, I'm still irritated by the thought of yet ANOTHER test to stress me out-- as though SAT's and ACT's and AP exams and all that jazz weren't enough.    I'm really tired, and I feel awful. I hurt everywhere. Every single muscle on my body feels as though it were about to tear. No, it's not an exaggeration-- I really feel rather awful.   Just blah. Eeeeek. Ew. Mech.   My apologies for a most pathetic post, but then, you didn't really have to read it after all, you know... You saw the title.      "All I Really Want" by Alanis Morissette   Do I stress you out My sweater is on backwards and inside out And you say how appropriate I don't want to dissect everything today I don't mean to pick you apart you see But I can't help it There I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off Slap me with a splintered ruler And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already If only I could hunt the hunter  And all I really want is some patience A way to calm the angry voice And all I really want is deliverance Do I wear you out You must wonder why I'm so relentless and all strung out I'm consumed by the chill of solitary I'm like Estella I like to reel it in and then spit it out I'm frustrated by your apathy And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land If only I could meet the Maker  And I am fascinated by the spiritual man I am humbled by his humble nature What I wouldn't give to find a soulmate Someone else to catch this drift And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses Falling all around...all around Why are you so petrified of silence Here can you handle this?  Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines Or when you think you're gonna die Or did you long for the next distraction And all I need know is intellectual intercourse A soul to dig the hole much deeper And I have no concept of time other than it is flying If only I could kill the killer  All I really want is some peace man a place to find a common ground And all I really want is a wavelength All I really want is some comfort A way to get my hands untied And all I really want is some justice...
