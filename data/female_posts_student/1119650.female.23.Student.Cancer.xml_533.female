Well on that trip I mentioned that we had stopped at  urlLink Stewart's Shops  and stumbled upon a very strange flavor of soda called "Vichy".  Now, you're prolly asking yourself the same thing we were "What the hell is a Vichy"?  Well, it wasn't seltzer water, it wasn't a citrus, it wasn't even tonic water or gingerale-ish (though it did come in a green bottle).  The  urlLink Stewart's  label didn't even offer much in the way of description.    This weekend on the trek home from snowboarding we stopped at Stewart's again.  We brought the bottle to the register and asked the kindly Saugerties native (with his three glorious, shiny teeth) what exactly is Vichy.  With a look that was a mixed bag of disgust, contempt and disbelief at our "lower New York" stupidity he said " What's Vichy?!?!  It's like club soda."  It was so matter of fact that we felt so ashamed and stupid for even having asked.  We stewed in our feelings of disappointment for a few moments as we walked silently to the car.  After a good laugh about how shocked he was that we weren't in the know about "Vichy" we stumbled upon the next of life's seltzery mysteries: what is the difference between Club Soda, Tonic Water and Seltzer?  Will we ever get to the bottom of this?
