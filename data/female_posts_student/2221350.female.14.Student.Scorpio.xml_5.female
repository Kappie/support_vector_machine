About 11 she came and checked me out and we had mother/daughter bonding time.   First we went to nicki's((Mexican food.. w00t)), and we were just chatting about random stuff when mom noticed me looking at the dude in the booth behind. She turned and looked at him and we started joking about asking him to come sit with us. So, of course, mom aked him. Turns out he is a really nice guy. Ernie, married, 4 kids by two different wives, has great taste in music, knew some people from mom's highschool. Then he bought us lunch and mom's peacock feathers puffed out because "you know you've got the prettiest mom when strange men will buy her lunch".  Then we went and got waxed((thank heavens for well-groomed eyebrows)).  Then we went and saw cold mountain. It was supremely depressing and in my opinion, not that wonderful. Every five seconds something((animal or human)) would be mutilated and killed and they didn't hold back one bit on the nasty details. Then before i could even chill out was the scene where they sawed a cows head off, they were having big ol' totally naked crazy Nicole kidman sex.   Then we came home in a fabulous mood and as soon as we walked in mammaw was like "well Shannon, if you meant to hurt my feelings you did a good job, you knew you were going to the movies and you didn't invite me". And mom was like "bla bla bla" and i thought "oh crap, now i feel bad about having a mother/daughter day and not making it a mother/daughter/grandmother day. Does she really mess up my moods like that? i mean, really.  So now I'm back home, Devon is spending the night somewhere, and it's all good.  Has anyone besides me ever noticed that smell you have when you've been outside near the dirt? It's not a bad smell, it's really earthy and calming. And i only smell it when I've been near sandy dirt, and it's not too hot outside. Well anyways i smelled it when i came up from playing tennis the other day and thought it was nice.  Yaaawn i better get some rest, I got a big day tomorrow. I invited shane to come bowling with me and tiffany and Chris, I hope he shows.  OH by the way the song of the day is devoted to nikki my bloggie buddy, the whole -sex fiend- thing might not exactly describe you nikster, but you get the idea. ((but hey, you could be a sex fiend and I just don't know it!))
