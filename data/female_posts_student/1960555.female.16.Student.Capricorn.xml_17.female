I' fine with hard moshing, hell, I even promote it, but when you purposly go out to steal things from people BUTTONED pockets and purposly hit/bite/scratch/pinch/grab them, I got problems.  I'm wondering why we like music.  Do we love it because it makes us happy, or it relaxes it, or maybe we just like the sound of it?  Do we like music because we can mosh to it? I think it's a bonus.  Why do we go to concerts?  To mosh and relieve stress and to see.hear our favorite bands in person.  I don't know about you, but I've never attended a concert to be robbed and beaten.  (Yes I know that accidents happen at concerts, but things are getting out of control latley.)  I've always felt safe at shows, until recently that is.  Take the Warped Tour for instance.  I felt safe, 1) becasue I was with friends who watched by back, and 2) the people there were sane.  No one was mugged at the tour, why you ask, because people there were there for the music.  You go to a festival like that with good reason.  I don't think many people spend $50-60 to go and be dicks to people and get yelled at.  WHY ARE PEOPLE SO STUPID???  Love the music.  Respect the music.  Respect the people.  Go to a concert, and please, please, don't be an ass.
