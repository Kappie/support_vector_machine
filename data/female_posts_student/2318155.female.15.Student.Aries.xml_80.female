As you played with my hair and kissed me I couldn't help but smile straight from my heart. I could see how much you cared from the look in your eyes. It made me never want to let you go. To just stay wrapped in your arms forever. Where nothing else matters but me and you."~Robyn Workizer  "Why is it that we spend a lifetime trying to define what love is.. what love means.. yet we know in an instant if we are in it?"  "Everytime I look at you, I know how much I love you. As soon as my heart skips a beat, I know. The second I feel the first butterfly in my stomach, I know. When I can't get rid of a smile that has been on my face since you left, I know. The way my eyes light up when you walk into the room, and how through out the day, you're the only thing on my mind. When you look at me with those big colorful eyes, I know you know too."  these are some quotes that remind me of jason! (:
