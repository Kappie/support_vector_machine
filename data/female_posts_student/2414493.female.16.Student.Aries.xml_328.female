He walked up to Charlie one day and drank all of his chocolate milk. He's surprisingly calm.  We're going to Brown tomorrow. More early mornings, ugh.  I just watched  The Shawshank Redemption.  Mighty good.  Somehow, everything seems to be all right again. Friends are just that magical.  Do I really want a relationship right now? It's one of those honest questions that you never dare ask yourself for fear of seeming shallow or scatterbrained or anything like that. Besides, the possibility becomes more and more remote by the day. We go back to the fact that I, in a strange way, am only attracted to people who don't know how to date.  And it's late. What kind of discussion is this anyway?
