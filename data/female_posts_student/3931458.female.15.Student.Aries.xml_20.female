But today austin miree and i went to st. anthony's it was great! we decided to go there cuz they get all into the hugging and hand raising stuff that we just dont do! so we went there and sat in the back and we pretended like we knew what we were doing with our hands while we were singing. and during the Our father austin and i played tug-a-war with miree!!!! oh and miree was hitting on me! it was kinda gross she kept putting her arm around me and touching my leg! oh oh and the preist was so funny cuz most of u guys have read about the catholic priest's and how much they like little boys and so during the homily the priest goes " i am going to tell you a story about two BOoooys." i dont know if u will get my meaning when i write it but he dragged out the word boys it was really funny that was great!!! Oh and we decided to leave after communion so that way we wouldnt have any trouble with getting out of the parking lot.  After church we went to see kayla at sonic! thanks for the message on my bag Kayla and for all of the condiments you gave me! Oh miree taught me how to jump into connie. i thought that if i did i would break my leg or something but i didnt.   When we got back to my house connie was being annoying cuz she wouldnt let miree take the keys out and she wouldnt start. so she is calling her dad and i go inside and get austin and miree is freaking out yelling at both connie and her dad so austin just calmly says " put the car in drive and then in park" and so miree does and it works!!! connie lets go of the keys and everybody is happy!  oh and my dad had us watch this old show or something where the guy didnt talk and he was pretending to use a chemical set or something. sorta like a mime it was confusing i didnt understand it!!!  oh crisco thanks for the comment!!! now at least 3 people read my blog!!!! and yes u did shun me!!! i cried myself to sleep many time over the years and its all cuz of u!!! hehehe j/k you are a great friend. we have to get back together again soon!!!
