It was a disappointed sigh; a viciously disappointed one. She had, in fact, run over this duck. With her own car, started by her own key, and propelled by her own foot. This was not a good sign.     Noel didn't usually believe in omens, but she knew without a doubt that this definitely was one. A horrible omen to have come across on the day of her last AP final. Noel wasn't frustrated at this fact, nor angry. Just... very disappointed. How could she have let this happen? She was a  wonderful  driver. License obtained on her 16 birthday, 50+ hours driven beforehand with her permit. This was a very disappointing event indeed.     Biting her lower lip, Noel crossed her arms and continued to stare at this deformed animal sprawled across the roadway. Vulture food is the only thought Noel had floating in her mind. A very graphic scene indeed. And then-- what would her friends think? What would they say? After the crude questions and remarks along the lines of, "Did you smash it?!" or "Was it gross?", Noel's friends would be simply horrified by the accident. Appalled. Noel herself was appalled at what she found herself capable of-- involuntarily, yet without and urge, effort, or thought to stop what would ultimately happen to this poor, poor duck who had been wondering across the country road.     "Where is your family, little duck?" Noel wondered, a calm, puzzled expression glazing across her face. Where had this duck been off to? Down the road for a soda pop? Surely not.     The ferocious sound of a car horn whirled her back to reality.     "Get out of the road, Bitch!" yelled an obviously upset teenage boy driving a beat up Honda Civic.     Noel, composure intact, glanced down at her watch revealing a time of 7:22am, and frowned. She was now going to be late for 1st period. Looking back at the duck once more, she decided that maybe it wasn't that huge of a deal in the first place. Maybe it's not even worth telling anyone else about.    Strolling back the her immaculate Chrysler Sebring Sedan and popping the drivers door open, Noel eased herself into the seat, turned the key, shifted into drive, and lightly pressed the accelerator; not forgetting to signal the fact she was getting back onto the desolate road, of course. Driving away from the scene, Noel was left just as she had first been-- disappointed.
