We found this cute little farmette out in the country, with two houses (one relatively new, nice pre-fab and the other a fixer-upper) on 5 acres going for less than what we paid for this monstrous house we live in now.  Hubby wants a lot of land because he and his Uncle used to raise and show German Shorthaired Pointers in field trials all over Northern California. His Uncle just went professional (they'd been doing the amateur circuit for like, ever) and Brian wants to get back into it too. This little farmette would be perfect!  Plus I hate this neighborhood, I hate the neighbors, I hate the houses on top of houses, I hate that there's no trees and no yards and regulation after regulation in this psycho-ass neighborhood.  So this might be a good thing.  We've discussed it and if it's feasible and we can actually accomplish it, we're going to put in a bid on that farmette and move the hell out of the city.  Thank god, because I'm totally a farmgirl at heart and want to have room to have a garden with all the damn lawn gnomes I want.  Plus, with 5 acres, we might be able to get a horse, which I would love!  The only problem is the fixer-upper house. It'll take forever to fix it up, but Hubby loves that stuff, and it's a beautiful old house with all hardwood floors and a wraparound porch and a big side window with a windowseat... And hubby can do all the repairs and I can pick out the decor and stuff, and then later on we can move into that house and maybe rent out the pre-fab home to someone else.  This potentially could be a really good business venture... Hubby's the business minded one and he seems pretty excited.  I'm just glad to get the fuck out of this house!   Cross your fingers for us! -Me
