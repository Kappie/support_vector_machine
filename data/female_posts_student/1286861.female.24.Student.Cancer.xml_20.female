It will be really exciting. You know what else will be exciting? When I get to the point where I have something else to be excited about besides theatre�an exciting job, or maybe an exciting boy. Oh well. There is more to life. THERE IS MORE TO LIFE.  So I have been chatting with a new friend. I know, I am full of new friends, but this one is special. Robbie was kind enough to pick me out of the proverbial �online crowd� and say hi. I really need to stop meeting guys this way, but I am afraid it is habit. I think it will end when I meet the man to keep me from it�hopefully he exists. A girl can dream. Back to Robbie though�he will be coming to see �Machinal� on Saturday and then we will go out afterwards. I am very self-conscious about what he will think when he meets me. Appearance wise, I mean. He says not to worry but I do and I will till after Saturday. I am crazy�and I have to constantly remind myself� THERE IS MORE TO LIFE.  Update on other things; babies are all good and healthy, took a typing test at Countrywide Home Loans this morning and passed, they will be calling in a week or two to set up a second interview, my license has been officially suspended so no driving, and I am finding it harder and harder to get to sleep.   I will write more later. Just a couple thoughts I wanted to get down. Thanks again to all those who read this�this�pathetic cry for attention. I am pretty sure that is what it is. :)
