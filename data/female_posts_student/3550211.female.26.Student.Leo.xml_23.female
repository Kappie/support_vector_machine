On Monday, at the White House unveiling ceremony for the Clintons' official portraits, Bush evidently acted totally out of character: "witty, engaged, amiable, bipartisan and magnanimous.   Mr. Clinton told friends afterward that he was blown away, that W. had never been so nice to him before. There was no smirk, no begrudging.   The article goes on to state that perhaps our presidential leaders have been rewired like the stepford wives.   Unfortunately, Cheney did not come out of the "operation" as well as Bush did.  Mr. Cheney isn't programmed to process evidence that shows he was wrong; he simply keeps repeating the same nonsensical claims as if he has a microchip malfunction. ... Cheney-bot just keeps going and going: "He had long-established ties with Al Qaeda. . . . He had long-established ties with Al Qaeda-a-a. . . . He-he-e-e—— brzzzrrrp!"
