They stared venemously as we walked by, ignoring their children as they made backhanded insults about Gavin's hair.   "Is that a boy or a girl?" asked Kurt, knowing full well he's a boy, considering he asks every time he sees him. "Oh," he said sarcastically, "I couldn't  tell ." Stifling the urge to kick him in the ass, I merely shrugged and said "He just has long hair, like his dad."  We had wondered why they seemed to have such trouble getting over our altercation from last week, when it happened that my mother ran into Stupid Head's mother at the mailbox ("Stupid Head" is a term of endearment, in this case). She told us that, shortly after our very public argument, which all the neighbors had been eavesdropping on, the evil neighbors let their kids out with balls again. After having their car hit, one of the good neighbors came out, bolstered by out outburst, and told the kids to cut it out. When they refused, and another short argument with the parents ensued, the good neighbor called the manager. The manager gave them the business, but not two minutes after he left, they sent their kids straight out again in defiance. They truly believe that their kids have every right to run unsupervised and throw balls at our cars, you see. Truly, they are on a crusade. And so that very night, several of the good neighbors walked over to the monthly board meeting that was in session, and reported them by name. An official warning came to them by post, with the threat of fines for future transgressions. And so it is that the neighbors aren't sure who it was who reported them, but are suspicious of us because of our past incidents with them.   I must say, knowing that they suspect us of turning them in to the board makes me feel much better about being on the receiving end of their poisonous glowers. We may be innocent, but we are happy to take some of the credit for getting this all underway.  Mwah ha ha!
