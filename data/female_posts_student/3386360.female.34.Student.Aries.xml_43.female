Depending on the path that each choose is depending on if they are lucky enough for find someone to share their lives with. Have you ever met someone who just seemed to fit perfectly with you ? Someone that you seemed to share something with that is unexplainable ? Have you ever had that person be unobtainable for whatever reason ? Same sex and your straight, they are married, you are married or you just realize that no matter how perfect you two are it would not work now ? I'm blessed with knowing some of my "souls" out there. One is married, we can talk about anything, comfortable silence, we know each others moves if walking we know when the other will turn type thing, his children are like my own, my children like him, we enjoy the same things, there is sexual attraction and there is a sense of contemptment as well. Just being near each other we can "recharge" our low battery. His honor is what keeps us apart. He would not leave his wife. At least not yet. We have spoken of a life together, we have even had the same dreams of a life together. Maybe one day it will happen. But for now he is with her and I am with someone else to a degree. I had made a promise to myself many years ago that I woudl never be with a married man. I know the pain and heart ach. So why then when he is around me do I feel like it is not wrong to be in his arms ? I do not feel it is cheating on the man I am with, I do not feel it is cheating on his wife. No we have not had sex yet and I'm not sure if we ever will. I know that there is something between us, I know that we fight it, I know that everyone sees it. Even people at his work will mistake me for his wife just by the way he "watches" me. People mistake his daughter as mine. Saying we make such a beautiful family.    Where does my future lay ? I dont know. I seriously do not think it is with him. If it is it wont be any time soon. Is it with the man who haunts my dreams ? In a huge way I hope it is. I do not want to think that I was in any way a cause of a break up in a marriage, besides the one who haunts my dreams holds my heart in a strange way. I believe it is important to talk about these things, these feelings. Not to hurt anyone but to be honest and open. I would never hurt the one who holds my heart, I would never cheat on him and I have turned down others who have asked me to have an affair.    Well I'm waiting for the satilite guy to come and hook up the stuff. Hope fully he will be here soon. He arrived and it's set up YAY cable again I missed t.v.  I need to clean my kitchen and do a few things around the house. Then wake up Tony and ask him to carry over the chair and bunk bed rails out of the old house. Today my mood is beyond good. I've not felt this good in many days. Oh yeah I'm taking the medication like a good girl (ugh) I hate pills and I take 4 a day now.. But on the plus side (not meaning my weight ether Lol) I am eating more and that is helping me lose weight   I just got a phone call.. Don is dead. My friend who had cancer. I'm rather in shock over this. I cant help but think of how he asked me to be with him but I was so involved with my other life. I didnt love him not the way he wanted me to. I did love him but as a friend. I think it is time for me to do some work. This makes three deaths within a month.
