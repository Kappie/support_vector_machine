Oh, I've also demoulded the bathroom, which involved putting purple stuff in the bits between the tiles with a toothbrush, then washing it off with a cloth then a wet toothbrush. Oh, then 'polishing' it with a dry cloth! Aaargh! my arm kills, and that took ages too! So less bored now, did any one else see Neighbours? Random question, but yeah... I me so it would have to be (EH?) Neighbours is so funny cause it's totally not serious! Mmm... aahhh! I need chocolate! I'll go get some bubbidibi!
