I did not know that...Dear Isis I am an airhead. I invited Stephanie (best friend lol) to come, so it will be pretty fun! She always makes everything fun. One of her talents hehe. I dunno..Im not sure I like zoos..i only like them because they keep animals safe from humans and such. But...it seems sort of mean to gawk at them like aliens or summat. I know how they feel...behind bars, looking on the outside, an outsider, being treated like a circus act. I know how it is. *sigh*  On Sunday, we're going to the movies. My brother is going to see some YuGiOh Movie (I HATE YU GI OH!!!!!!!!!!! *throws fetus at TV*), but IM gonna see The Villiage! :D Omfg it looks great. After that we're going shopping...I need new clothes. So...yea, Nikole is gonna be a busy person. Well, I hope everyone's day went well...I am gonna go. If anyone wants to caht on MSN, my name on it is;  urlLink Mydnyte_fantasy@excite.com . I know it sounds wrong shutup...mydnyte fantasy...it was the name of a showhorse I happen to be a fan of ookay? :P Lol..ta ta. Sleep tight all..dont let the fetuses bite.  *random thought* hmm...I want Irish Creme Coffee right now...really bad. Or a MooLatte from dairy queen...hmm. I have strange urges for coffee at the worst times lol. Ta ta.
