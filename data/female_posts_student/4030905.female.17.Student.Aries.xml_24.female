Actually got morning call..but I was too sleepy. Cos I didn't want to sleep yesterday, even though I was really really tired. Haven't been sleeping enough. But nvm..I got ways to keep myself awake just to sit through boring lectures. Half a can of coffee every morning before class starts will do the trick. So boring. There's school for me tml. so happy. Dun have to stay at home. Can see my friends and play and crap. hahaha..
