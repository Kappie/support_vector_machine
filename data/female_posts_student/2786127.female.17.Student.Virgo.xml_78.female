The trip seems surreal right now... we've planning parasailing, surfing, snorkeling, swimming with dolphins, a dinner whale watch cruise and riding a helicopter around the Island. Holy. Shit. Coolest vacation ever...and i think i'm begginning to actually like Stefs daughters...they're actually really nice and pretty funny.  So...thats all good.   whats not all good...is I that I wrote Lindsay an email saying I've been trying to get ahold of her foreves and haven't been able to and that she should call me/write me soon....and I have yet to recieve a phone call and/or email. Man.  *hums* Istambul the city of dreams...*hums*
