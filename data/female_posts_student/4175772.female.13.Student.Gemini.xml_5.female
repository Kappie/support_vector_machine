Our car got assaulted by a tree branch today in the Wegmans parking lot.  I could have sworn I told my Flagglets to protect the Trailblazer with their little lives... Hmmmm.  Maybe I need to pay them more for that kind of work.  "I'm not so think as you drunk I am." -Margaret "Shut your pie hole." -Steph K. Radar: "Sir, we're expecting an enemy parachute drop!"
