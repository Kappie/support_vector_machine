So at 8 I wake up and realize it's raining pretty good. Once I ate breakfast, I went to straighten my hair. The only I straightened it was because I was bored and I knew it was just gonna curl right back when I went to out. (because of the rain since my hair is naturally curly) But my hair was all, I don't know, greasy perhaps is the word? Like it didn't make any sense! I took a shower and put in my shine stuff that I've been using for a few weeks so it's just strange that it got nasty this morning. So blah, blah, blah. I go to wake up Eddie because he was going to my Grandpa's with his friend to prime and re-paint his whole house (outside) but Eddie was like, "It's raining, I can't paint if it's raining." And I felt bad because I know how much sleep he's been missing out on while painting my Grandpa's house but I was like, "Eddie, you still have to get up, you have to take me to City Hall." And he was whining, "But I don't wanna!" He still did though!  Aww, isn't he so cute?!  LoL! So I get to City Hall and a few people are there. The reason I had to go was because the Board of Education wanted the fall activities to pass out booklets on the Levy in August to all the houses in Wickliffe. So I was paired with Matt, Nicole, and this Devin kid. We were the first to leave and it only took us a half hour to do a whole street. But Nicole and I went back and did one more street. It's wasn'tlong so that was good.I was so wet when I came home. Like my pants from being attacked by flowers and bushes. And I was sweating so much! It was funny. I think I burned a good amount of calories because I was starving once I came home. LoL, and it seemed like I always got the crazy part of the street. The first street, like my drive ways were like 50 yards long! Then the next street, it seemed like all the houses had dogs.  Evil dogs.  At this one house the dogs were like ready to break the door down and eat me! So when I came home I ate, read some of my magazine that I've been ignoring because I've actually been reading Lord of the Flies, and then I went online to check my email. Since no one was on, I just signed off, and went to go see what was good on TV. Go figure, nothing was good. So I laid in bed and tried to read my magazine. I read like one page and then I decided to go back to sleep. Which is really weird for me because I never take naps. So I fell asleep with my cat for almost 2 hours. Now that I'm up, I still feel a little tired. Oh well. My eyes hurt pretty bad too because I was too lazy to take out my contacts before I went to sleep. But now I took 'em out. I just need to go get my glasses. It's weird, I need my glasses or contacts for everything really but when I wear my glasses and I'm on the computer it's makes it harder for me to see. Maybe because I'm near sighted and my glasses make the print bigger and it bugs me. Oh well, just felt like sharing my strange experiences.   I'm a dork!   I'll post a poem later or something like that.
