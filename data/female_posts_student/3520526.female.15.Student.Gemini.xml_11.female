It was pretty intense (yeah i know that word is overrated) anyways...it was quite the fun time...maya got pretty agressive towards some guys (you tell 'em maya) hah greatness. man i am really not respecting this weather..or lack therof...it's very blah. hey well i'm off champs :) oh yes, and happy father's day to all you fatherly figures
