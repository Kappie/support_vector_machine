It was so weird to see men with nothing but tight tights on. My friends actually liked it. Hey, I wasn’t there to check anybody’s out. I was just there to kill time, to enjoy myself and hang out with friends. Not to lie but there were a peek here and there but that was it.   I was surround by much much older people who obviously never heard of any of the songs being play before. Such as, I got five on it, in da club, baby boi, etc. Its amazing to see how many people cannot move for shit. I’m not trying to say that I’m any good but it was one hell of a laugh when you are dancing soberly. Of course, everyone got his or her own lil sass, twist, or spunk to the beat.   I think that dancing is something that you were born with. Something that you actually like doing naturally. I was able to pick up the moves just like that and throw some of my own moves in and got some extra credit by the instructor. I was honor and I was turning red at the moment but hey I had a great time. Did I mention that dancing is a part of me? I love it no matter what type of dancing it is. I think that dancing is a gift, why not use it rite. I wont let that go to waste. I will enjoy it every grips I get.    I enjoy dancing and music. At the clubs, what really annoys me most is when I’m on the dance floor trying to dance alone or with a bunch of friends in circles. Dudes from nowhere started dancing around me trying to get attention. WTF. If you are trying to pick me up, just talk to me let me judge your knowledge.
