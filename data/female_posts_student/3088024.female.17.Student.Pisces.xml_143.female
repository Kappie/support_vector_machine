Secondly, it would not hurt one of you to start reading entire sentences or paragraphs.  I, at the top of a comment, direct it to a certain person, and you respond to me as if I said it to someone else.   Instance #1 of misinterpretation "Dustin- I took offense to the comment you made to Julie regarding her heritage. Not only was it sarcastic, but you called her...arrogant?"(From Jenna)  I said "I love your need to point out your heritage.  I thought I would too.  I have decided to be proud(not arrogant) of where I come from."  I did not call Julie arrogant.  I said I was not being arrogant due to the fact that "arrogant" seems to be your catchphrase for me.  Instance #2 "**cough** Back off Jules."(from Jenna)  When did I directly attack or fight with Julie?  Intance #3 "As for Dustin: It seems that you forget what you write and then refuse to back yourself up, so I'm going to try to help you out. TO START, you wrote, " I have decided to be proud(not arrogant) of where I come from." I am quite proud of my heritage, believe it or not. If you question my values on my own family history, you will want to take it back... be VERY aware of that."(from Julie)  When THE HECK have I EVER questioned your values?  You jumped into the middle of a disagreement between Seth and I and act as though I personally attacked you before I even knew you existed.  Instance #4 "You said you were holding yourself back to an extreme extent. Really, what do you have to say to someone you have never met and tried to outwit? What do you have to say to me that you are holding back so darn much? Because if you believe your balls have finally dropped, and that you have the right to say I am arrogant about my past, just try telling me what your holding back."(from Julie)  LEARN TO FREAKING READ!  I did not say I was holding back about anything you said.  I was holding back on Jenna's need to jump in attack me and be very two-faced.  ALSO, I NEVER CALLED YOU ARROGANT!?!  Instance #5 "You also claimed that Seth was anti-semitic. If you look at Seth's journal under the date - 5/19/04, you said: " I do not appreciate your anti-Semitic idiocy." Either you have extreme short-term memory or you are just ignorant, because he is my best friend and we also dated for two years."(Julie)  I did not forget saying this.  I never said I didn't say it.  Sidenote:5/17... It took me forever to realize there is no 5/19...  Instance #5 "you about doing the same EXACT thing to Seth, and now you are doing it to Rosey and Annie as well. Just quit trying to be a higher authority."(Julie)  WHO IS ANNIE?  WHEN have I EVER mentioned her?  Instance #6 "you attempted to wave your little IQ around to impress me. every mannerism of yours that i have experienced is dripping with arrogance."  HOLD UP!  When have I tried to wave my IQ around.  Day 1 I acknowledged your IQ was higher than mine.  I am SO far from arrogant.  Don't talk about judging people you don't know and then call me arrogant.  It is hypocritical.  ALL THREE OF YOU misinterpret EVERYTHING I say and call me arrogant.  There are so many more...I have things to do though.(I bet that is probably  arrogant )  Anyways, Julie I have never said anything bad about you...so other than me calling Seth an anti-Semite...I have no clue what your beef is.  I would suggest you move on and forget about me as my importance is miniscule in the scheme of things.  Jenna, words cannot even express...  Seth, I would also suggest you find a way to let go of your bad feelings and lighten your load.  Also, I miss my spot on the blog.  I felt loved.  ;)  I wish things had not gone this way or this far.  You are pretty cool.  Julie, I don't know you.  At all.  I do not try to say ANYTHING about your beliefs because of that.  I would appreciate since you are older and hopefully more mature, if you could do the same.  Bottom line is I DON'T MATTER.  Stop wigging out over everything I say.  If you have a comment, I have a comment link.
