I'm not sure what's going on at all. I guess I'm going to go talk to the TA on Friday to talk about where I went wrong, and what I can do in my next essay to do better. This is starting to be a pattern, so I'm beginning to think it has something to do with me and not just my TAs. I guess I'm just not working as hard as I have in the past... I miss von Henneberg. I could always write clever, thoughtful essays and tests for her. She had a really approachable and well organized style that I miss in my teachers this quarter. After 4 years of As, getting a big patch of Bs is really disheartening. But I just need to work harder and not give up completely, which is what I'm tempted to do at this point.
