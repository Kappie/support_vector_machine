But I haven't seen you When normally I don't have to try to see you When normally you just appear Like the last time I saw you When I nearly ran into you As you were entering and I was exiting When I saw you then, I didn't feel The shock to the heart, followed by the pang of overwhelming sadness That I usually feel when I see your face. If I hadn't come face to face with you I might not have noticed you at all. So perhaps I have seen you and didn't realize, Becoming more like you. But still, I wonder where you've been, So maybe not.
