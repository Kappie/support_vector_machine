Both of us are originally from satellite communities of the Dot, and have been to the tradtional "coffee houses" and "battles of the bands" when the highschool-aged bands we went to see were kids we went to highschool with.  But standing there, both of us now 19+(++++) it tickled us both to think that no fake I.D. was required.  I kinda wish it were...  But of course, these are different times.  These are times unlike the teenage years when friends' parents were introduced as Mr and Mrs.  Now they're Ken and Marilyn, and I get kisses on the cheek and big familiar hugs and invitations to be a weekend surrogate daughter.  There's another difference, one that I'm a little reluctant to admit to...  This scene, this indie-rock, coffee house, battle of the bands scene... well, it just isn't my scene anymore.  No more do I have any desire to stand around in a smoky club listening to so-so rock-n-roll until 1 in the morning.  By 11:30 I was giving Amy "the look": whenever you want to bust a move on outta here, I'm ready to go.    All of the above does not mean I didn't have a good time... I was just pooped by the end of the night.  But I had an awesome time.  It was great seeing Ky again--it's been since our last exam, a couple of weeks ago--and I've really missed her.  It was really weird driving into the city, parking at the school parking-lot I usually use, and walking up to their apartment building.  The buzzer box still has Ky's name on there (J-Lo has been added yet) but the difference once I got inside the apartment was phenomenal.  It's not Ky  Ames' place anymore...now it's Ames and Jeff's.   I don't like it.   Jeff's a nice guy, sure, but he's a guy!  No walking around half-naked (ok fine, it's not as if we did that excessively before, but at least it wouldn't have been inappropriate had the need arisen), no peeling girly laughter at all hours... it's just not the same.  And, he's junked up the place with all sorts of typical guy crap, like signs that say "24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case.  Coincidence?"  What a jerk-off.  Ok, maybe some of this hostility is a little misdirected, I just hate that Ky's gone now.  As we were both equally drunk (which is to say, not very) and equally bored, Ames  I stuck by each other most of the night.  Ky was the blizted social butterfly, making friends and solving problems all night long, so Ames  I were left to our own devices for a lot of the time.  At one point, Ky went to grab us another round of beers, and when she came back she found Amy  I deep in a catty conversation (!) and she pulled Ames into a hug, I dog-piled on top--"I love you guys!"  And when we all pulled away, there were the fattest tears streaming down Ky's face.  Awww... "Don't be sad, Ky!"   "I'm not sad, I'm happy.  I'm so glad we're all friends, and I miss you guys so much!"  OK ladies, time out.  Let's go to the bathroom and blot some of these tears and come back and finish our beers.  My class starts next week.  I told Ames to be prepared, I'm gonna be calling her a lot!  I've gotta remember that she works at Koffler now, and not Woody's, 'cause I can go swing by there for some coffee  conversation.  Not to mention all-day breakfast at Hart House, sushi at New Gen, and I'm sure the occassional brew or two at a local establishment.  It's really such a shame to have met such great chicks that I became such fast friends with right at the end of university.  I partially blame that on the relationship.  Granted, breaking up with B sooner wouldn't have caused me to meet these chicks any sooner, but I might have forged and maintained more and better friendships had I not always been rushing back home.  Ah, what's the use in being theoretical anyway?  The friends I've got are great ones, I'm grateful for them everyday.  And you guys know who you are... (you blog voyeurs!)
