And I need a front wheel bearing or baring or whatfuckingever.  Total cost: $1200.00  I had to cancel my drug testing appt at Covance. They would have paid me $1200.00.  Something'snot right.  I really don'tneed this shit right now.  All I've ever wanted to do wasprovide for my family and friends. I can't do any of that in the position I'm in right now. Granted had I not provided for my family in the past I wouldn't be in this position. But shit happens. You live, you fucking learn. I haven't. So I will remain in this position until the day I set myself on fire on the east or west coast, preferably the east coast.  I wanted to cry a little today.  I wanted to quit my job.  I'm being a real shit to everyone...and I don't care.  I'm having a BAD DAY.  You know what really pisses meoff.  People are smiling and waving todayas they leave. I don't feel like smiling. I feel like saying to hell with it. All of it. All of it except my babies. laya, day and erra. I have to stay for them. Cause in my head, nobody loves them as much as me. And in reality nobody sees them less than me. That's sad. I don't have time though. When I do have time all I want to do is wallow in self pity. I like wallowing.  Yes, and today, it's all over 1200 dollars. But you have to understand the cycle.  I have a shit load of other bills. I've added to them 3 times in the last 4 or 5 years. My laptop, my car, and my credit card. All things that have benefited me. My laptop for school work, my car to get to and from school and my cc to slowly but surely rebuild my credit. Other shit just comes up. Like my dental bills and my hospital bills and the electric bill and other shit on my report. And every time I pay something off, something else comes up. And it's quite discouraging. Ya know.  And this fucking phone will not stop ringing! I hate my job!!  But that's it. It never ends. It won't ever end. And it sucks. What sucks even moreis I can't kill myself because I don't have life insurance!!!! (I'm just angry, suicide is for sissies.) How pathetic is that?!?!  Probably not more than this blog.
