I HATE Katherine reading this with all the passionate venom in my body) but ... it's addictive.  Fousseau.  Well, that was an interesting experience.  I can't really be bothered to write about it.  I'll write about  Nick , though.  The stupid lil ...  We were on the ferry on the way back, and there was this TRULY fit guy with the school that was next to us.  They were from some weird-ass place in Bristol.  So anyway, people wanted to know who I was gawping at, so I told everyone ... including Nisha, who asked him what his name was.  (Nick, obviously.) She also found out he's a Gemini.  (50% compatibility, but the reason is Cancers like to stay at home and not go out, while Geminis are party animals.  Well, I lurve going out, so I'm thinking that's not so true, maybe.) I don't think he knew who "that girl over there, her name's Jools, she fancies you" was, but Harris and Luke Smith asked him if he'd go out with me, and apparently he said, "No, she's a dog." *Spits.* I don't know whether to believe them or not :S Clare reckons Nick thought they meant her, cuz she was wearing a pink top and jeans too, and Nick and his mates were giving her evils - but can anyone really call Clare a dog?  I don't know.  Anyway, I made up a song and I was singing it on the bus on the way home.  It's my MSN name as well.  "Oh Ni-ick, I thought you were fit but you were a prick, I'm glad they took you away-ay, oh Ni-ick ..."  Madame Field heard me singing it. I've never been looked at so strangely in my life.  We were talking to a bunch of the boys from Nick's school, who weren't Nick, or his mates (especially the one we nicknamed Rastafarian, because he had Jamaican sweatbands on his head and wrists) so they were really nice.  Nisha got a crush on this one (even though she swears she's a lesbian) because he had a "sexy voice", but then we found out he had a throat infection, so that was why it was all husky.  He was called Anthony.  There was Josh, Stoner (a.k.a. Francis, or Franny), another Nick, Dan, Paul (Nisha kept calling him Theo for some reason) and Steve, too. They wouldn't believe we were in Year 8; they thought we were Year 11 or something.  They all thought we were sooo posh cuz we go to a private school.  Then Steve pretended he went to Millfield but he got expelled for setting a toilet on fire ... we all thought he was a pyro until he started telling us we were really gullible.  Oh yeah, and I almost forgot about Will.  He had a water bottle and he kept spraying it everywhere.  We were all drenched.  I really have to do my homework now.  I didn't  mean  to leave it this late.  To whoever left that message, yes, I am scared, and no, I don't know who you are.  So, who are you then?  Sean? One of Katherine's friends?  A weird stalker?  My life is addictive ... well yeah, I can't live without it, can I?  What am I, a soap opera?  How am I disturbed, anyhoo?  See you later, *~Jools~*  Oh my God! It's almost summer!! Can I get a hallelujah?  Hallelujah!
