I told one of my friends about the fact that evidentally us falling for each other is an earth-shaking event.  He said "You really are a prep in purest form."  Whatever that means.  So, I hear from Linds I've had a couple death threats.  Classy people.  At least this Elizabeth girl likes me, and Rosie.  Wow, I was just checking some of the history on this blog, but the one thing I want to know most of all is, who's Mitch?  Look, I don't really know any of you that well, so if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer.  I guess I should tell you about myself or something, like Lindsey said, I play football, I throw for track, I lift, I don't know.  I don't want to bore everyone.  I just know I met her Monday night/Tuesday morning a week ago.  Since 1:00AM Friday, I have been in a state of depression over the possibility of not seeing her again.  You guys don't know how lucky you are.  I gotta go, see ya.
