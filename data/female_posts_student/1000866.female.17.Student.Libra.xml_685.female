However, here I am....writing....to you, the beautiful people that read my blog. *Crickets chirp*.....Well....ok, maybe to the beautiful  person  who reads my blog. Hi beautiful person.   Anyway, first of all, I'd like to say thank you to Joanne for your lovely comment and Mary Clare. I love the few comments I get. I suppose a few worthwhile comments is worth far more than a bunch of comments that don't mean anything. And thank you to the person I don't really know who leaves fascinating comments here. I enjoy them. I do intend to go buy my shoes later. :) And, I'm going to love them.   Last night was great. Really fantastic. You know those experiences you have that really make you appreciate what you have and your life and how wonderful things are....even if it just lasts a day, it still happenes and last night was definitely one of those nights. It was amazing how many people were there. I didn't realize how tough it would be for me though. The Luminaria ceremony was really, really difficult for me. I just kind of separated from my friends, walked by myself, and...well...cried my eyes out. I don't know if they noticed but I think they did. I think they also sensed I just needed to be left alone for a bit. That's the great thing about having best friends that know you really well. They know when to just let you be. So, I cried, a lot. It was the first time in a long time that I really let myself think of my grandma. I just kept looking up at the stars thinking, I hope she sees me doing this and is proud of me. She used to be someone I'd love to impress. Not to say I was doing the walk to impress anyone. I guess the only person I'd want to impress with it would be her.   So, after I had a good cry which, rarely, rarely happens with me I finished walking with my friends for the reast of the Luminaria ceremony. It just felt great to be alive and have terrific friends and...it felt good. That was the only time I cried all night though. I kept myself from crying a lot. I almost did when Audrey walked with her mom. She's Rebecca (Kathryn's little sister's) friend. She had cancer too. I think she was the youngest survivor there. It made me really happy to see them do the survivor walk together and to see Audrey and her mom cry. I gave my mom a giant hug when I got home today. It felt really, really good. I mean, I hug my mother on a daily basis but, sometimes...certain hugs mean more than others.   And today, I think I'm going to go get maybe an hour of sleep and then...it's off to trumpet sectionals. Three hours. Sigh. That's unfortunate but, it wont be too bad. I'll make it. Maybe I'll go get some caffienated beverage. Wow, I just checked my spelling on caffienated and I spelled it correctly the first time. That's amazing. I usually have a lot of trouble with that word. Anyway, this turned into a much, much longer entry than expected. I think I'll write about the funny aspects of the evening later. This was a more serious entry for me.
