That heart, held within your body In those confusing nights I dream  	The wind, its halting words are a gentle illusion The clouds, the broken future like a distant voice  The moon, a heart flowing in the clouded mirror The stars, broken and swaying, like tears unable to be hidden.  Isn't it beautiful, to walk together in each others hands I do so want to go, To your city, your house, into your arms.  That face, A soft touch, Dissolving into morning, I dream.  "Isn't It Beautiful" From the game Final Fantasy 10
