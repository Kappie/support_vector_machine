(o by the way if you have seen it...there really is or was no guy with a chainsaw that killed people...ever. the stories of  psycho ,  silence of the lamb s and of course  texas chainsaw massacre  are all based off of a Wisconsin killer  Ed Gein . Yeah ... and he used a pistol to shoot his victims so don't believe everything you hear and see.)
