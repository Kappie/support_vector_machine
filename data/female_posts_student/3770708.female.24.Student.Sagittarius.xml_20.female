I point an angry finger at the patriarchy for making women vomit to keep themselves thin. And even so, I look in the mirror and feel ashamed. Last night, I stayed up and watched Road Rules. My eyes flickered longingly over the thin teens, I had fleeting thoughts of buying TrimSpa so I could look like Anna Nicole Smith in her commercials. By the end of the night, I had made a vow of starvation and executed dozens of crunches. I had fantasies of waltzing into my high school reunion in three years and making Justin Miguel remember why he gave me that half-naked picture of him.  It could be worse. Last year I felt like dying. My stretch marks from giving birth were angry and red. I had lost only 15 of the 42 pounds I had gained. My hair was falling out. I watched Mike and Peter and Chrysa swim, tanned and lean and uninhibited, and I felt a deep sickness and self-loathing. I was sure I would never be attractive again, doomed to be fat and pale and tired forever.   In the past year, I lost two more pant sizes. My stretch marks faded. My hair grew back. I have a tan, I wear shorter skirts. Still, I feel shapeless and ugly most of the time.   Today, I started my "diet". I picked at a scrambled egg. Drank tea for a snack. Felt guilt as I ate a sandwich at lunch. By dinner, I was so disheartened that I allowed my mom to feed me a tv dinner and ice cream. Just fucking great, now I have to start over. And I know this is all wrong.  I look fine. I'm healthy, I'm slowly losing weight as Gavin continues to nurse. I know I should love myself, and by and large I'm far more accepting of my body than I was before I had a baby. But still, I find myself running my fingers over my torn skin and trying not to cry in horror. I stand in the mirror and pinch the permanant bulge of baby belly that throws my figure out of balance and makes me look like a pear. I look at pictures from my teens and remember being able to dress however I liked and know that the boys would look as I walked by. I feel surges of anger at the people who told me I was fat in high school, when I was muscular and tanned and on the swim team.   I know it's wrong, but I hate myself a lot of the time. And I don't know how to really get over it.
