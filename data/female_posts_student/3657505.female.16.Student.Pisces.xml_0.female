This has been a bad day, a very bad day, one of those days you look back and go "Glad I'm not her".  I would tell the whole story, but to tell you the truth, I'm really, really tired and can't be bothered with the typing and the emotions and the thinking of different intteligent sounding descriptive words to litter my post with.  I honestly think this all comes down to tiredness. I haven't had a full proper nights sleep in about... uh... nine days. My problem seems to be going to bed too late. Saturday night is usually my saviour. The one day I know I will get that full nights sleep. Alas, I had to wake up really early on the Sunday to get to a gig, to que outside to get a good view. Thus, my sleeping was disturbed.  I'm tired, I'm emotionally tired and physically tired. Is it just me or does anyone else feel offended when they get told "You look tired" or "You look ill".   Whoah. That yawn could have swallowed my whole face there! I have to go and rest my eyes. To conclude, I'm clumsy because I'm tired. I'm tired because it's my own fault I don't go to bed early enough.  Thank you, and good night
