Yesterday - the day of mixed blessings.  1) Good: JumperCable Rental (VSO Truck place) has everything ready for the VSO.  Bad: I rear-ended another car on the way back to school.   2) Good: Car isn't damaged. No police report needed. Bad: I was late to class any my nerves are shot.  3) Good: I understand  SPSS  programming for COMM 3800 Research. Bad: I was late and missed the statistics part of the lecture.  4) Good: We got the  stage  set. Bad: Because Plondke didn't check the schedule to make sure we had the stage at the earlier time, crew got an hour and a half late start setting up the stage.  5) Good: We finished the stage. Bad:  Plondke's  not happy with it.  6) Good: I saw  April Holstrom  (AGD). Bad: She thinks I would be good at AVON (what she is doing) but - Like I have the time.  7) Good: I formally have a job interview w/  NYLIFE  in Columbus. Bad: Its really not the job I want.  8) Good: I talked to the  parents . Bad: They want me to do what they want me to do.  9) Good:  Shaun  called, interested in hanging out Friday evening. Bad: I have VSO  10) Good: Passed  German  quiz. Bad: I'm still not doing well in there.   All I am doing these days is stressing out. VSO really isn't helping. We have this "last minute craziness" and everyone seems to loose their brain and get PMS all at once. Oh well... I knew this would happen.  More Later.
