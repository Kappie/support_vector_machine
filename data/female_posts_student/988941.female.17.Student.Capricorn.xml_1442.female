I really don't like the game itself and I have made the effort and watched a match before but I find it incredibly pointless because in my opinion its some guys kicking a ball into a net which doesn't actually require that much talent. I like footie when your playing it with your mates and its just a laugh but anything bigger, no thanks. Give me a good ol game of rugby, a bunch of lads with a ball. Simelar to footie in that aspect but there are many more ways of scoring etc... And that really is talent, just look at Johnny Johnny Johnny Wilkinsons lastkick. Yuss! Although lately I have become a bit partial to cricket. I love it. Woo! The barmy army, love em!! So back to why I hate football. I hate the world cups and stuff because you get all the football hooligans which I know isn't everyone but it seems to be most people and then they have to go off and get pissed and get into fights (something riugby goers do not do, a game I went to the fans simply shook hands said good game then wandered off happy as bees) just take Croydon as an example. 400 fans in Croydon, riot. Smash windows etc..., surrounded a tram. 15 or so policeman were injured. Thanks a lot, what if that had been my dad working that night? Luckily he wasn't but he could be next time. I see why people drink alcohol at games but there is no need to drink that amount that causes rioting. I mean, what exactly were they rioting about?? The fact we lost? well we still have 2 games left and even if we lose oh well, theres always next time.
