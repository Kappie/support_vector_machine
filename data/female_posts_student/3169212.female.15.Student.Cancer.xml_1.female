Now, the Fremen cracked open her eyes to find her vision blurred by some sort of gel. Air appeared to be administered to her via a tube and mask from the surface, and she noticed her clothing to be a bit on the revealing end of things. Unhappy with this situation, she swam (so to speak) to the top of the tank, where she found very little life.  She groped by her side, where she found that her beloved crysknife was missing, as was her zatn'katel. That certainly would not do.  After quickly checking the nearby side of the large tank for life, Khala broke through the wires connected to what little preserved her decency, grabbed a towel, and rid herself of the strange coverings. Once this was done, she climbed down a ladder that led to the top of the odd tank, where she found her Tok'ra garb.  Finally comfortable enough to settle down a bit, she gave the room a more thorough look-over. Small beds with white coverings, each with a set of curtains ready to surround it, lined two long walls. Khala estimated that there were twenty altogether. Another strange tank towered beside hers with two more on the opposing wall. In the center of the wall to her left was a glass door, which led into a seemingly featureless hallway.  Three of the beds on the far half of the room were occupied, but on her side of the room sat only one person: a human (she did not sense any naquada). This woman sat on one of the beds, facing Khala's tank. Her head was down, and she stared at her hands.  The Tok'ra approached, cautiously watching the stranger, noting that her weaponry lay undistrubed on the sheets beside her. After slipping around the tall woman, she replaced the knife and zat on her person. "What have you done to me?" Khala asked.  Jinix looked up, her yellow, cat-like eyes catching the Tok'ra's attention. "I saved your life, for one."  "My life was not in danger."  "Well, you had a pretty bad wound."  "It would have healed shortly."  "And how would I know that?"  "My clothing."  "Why would your clothes give that away?"  "Do many species here dress as I do?" Khala asked, indicating the brown leather garb typical of Tok'ra.  "Only on Tatooine."  "And do these Tatooinians heal quickly or not?"  "I don't think they do."  "Oh." Khala's eyes widened as Thellas reminded her of her trouble with the planetary authorities. Such matters seemed so foreign to Tok'ra. "The locals. Are they still looking for me?"  "We pretty much took care of them."  "Good. We did not want to completely incapacitate them as we did customs."
