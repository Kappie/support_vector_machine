I'll miss Wade and Ashley very much. I know that they won't read this, but you are. I wanted to make it known that part of my heart is leaving with one of the two, no names mentioned. And as a special note, I declare the following statement officially and on the record: Jean Ellen Schultz Harrison Hilton is no longer related to me in any way.
