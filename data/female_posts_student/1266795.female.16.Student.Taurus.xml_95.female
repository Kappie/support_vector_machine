Quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentes. Your hint? It comes from a famous book! wOOt! And the last one? "Pacta Sunt Servanda" (Accords (or treaties) should be observed (Basic principle of International Law)) Ah, something profound. Don't worry. I will soon throw in some non profound ones! And some in French! yay! Yes, so. House has gotten a lot less quiet. The kids are back. I think that I just might go with my grandfather. Although, I am still on the fence about it. Ah well. I shall figure it out! :-D Hmm..the young one, aka Chelly, is complaining.  She also brings news of the mailman coming. He had better have brought that report card. I might go crazy if it doesn't come soon, lol! Ah well. That's just me.  The young one is still complaining. I must go. I shall update later. Goodbye.  "I never tire of being useful."
