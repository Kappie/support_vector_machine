Finally, I lay down and fell into a deep slumber.  I dreamed… I was in a dark room.  It was so dark that I felt I had become darkness itself.  It was dark and I liked it.  Suddenly, a face appeared as if it had been pulled out of murky water.  Its eyes stared vacantly at me with sorrow.  Its lips moved slowly. “Choose,” it said,” choose…” If eyes truly were windows to the soul, I agreed that this creature was, indeed, soulless.  “Where am I?” I said. The specter did not answer.  I realized, to my horror, my lips were paralyzed.  I felt foolish for becoming trapped by my own dream. “Choose…” crooned the looming face. An extravagantly decorated head appeared from behind.  Its earrings were of small, delicate and milky pearls.  Its hair was of lustrous red brown colour.  Yet, its eyes stared vacantly like the first. “Fortune…” it whispered as another beautiful face appeared.   “Fame…” said the other. Many faces were appearing out of the dark.  Voices echoed against each other.  Some shrieked in agony as others whispered in a honey-coated tongue. “ Beauty, luck, talent, joy…” The clashing voices continued until each face had stated its purpose. “Choose!” they shouted together. My heart raced.  Here, I could have any wish I wanted! Here, I could do anything!  I began to choose which face I should take.  I was excited until greed slapped me like a glove. “Choose!” they said angrily. I burst into tears.  I could not believe how selfish I had been.  I struggled to resist the power that was sealing my voice. “No!” I shouted to the faces.  I was as shocked as they were.  I had spoke! “No!” I continued,” I do not need your power!  I can decide my own path.  I will achieve what I want myself not by someone else’s power!” I stopped.  I was panting, no, gasping for air.  Fear began to run into my bones like cold water. “No?” Repeated the faces, lividly. I curled into a ball.  I waited to feel the angry faces tearing into my exposed backside.  When I opened my eyes, I was sitting in an old wooden chair in front of a fire.  An old man nudged me lightly with his cane and offered me a cup of cocoa. “ Welcome to Simplicity,” he seemed to sing slowly,” I believe you came from the land of Greed.  Many people have joined Greed and become one with the faces.  You are one of the few who refused the faces.  You see, every now and then, people dream of us.  We teach them wisdom.  Now, dear child, you may ask me a question and I will answer it.” I gripped the empty cup of cocoa in my hands.  I licked my lips and answered, “  What is the meaning of Life?” “  Life?  Silly child! Not everything must have a reason!  In life, you love and are loved.  You either help the world or hinder it.” I sighed. “Well, if you must know, the purpose of life is-“ Ring!  I woke up and slammed my alarm clock.  It just had to ring when I was about to learn the meaning of Life.  Then, I smiled. It was better this way.  I could learn the meaning of life myself.  I could almost hear the old man chuckling in the back of my mind. I spent the rest of the day at school pondering about my strange vision. “ Settle down, class” said the teacher, “today we will debate on quotations.” Character is what you are in the dark                 Quoted from Dwight L. Moody Was neatly printed on the board.   My arm itched as I raised my hand eagerly. The teacher nodded towards me.  I rose and began to speak. “ Had I been the person I was, I would disagree with this quotation.  But, since I am now a more learned child, I agree because of a dream I had….” And, the old man smiled.  End
