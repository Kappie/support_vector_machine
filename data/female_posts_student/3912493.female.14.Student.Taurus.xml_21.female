Pretty soon it will just be me and all these super good nerdy people so I will get last chair every time and won't have any friends! -Sally   I wish I could write everything that's going around in my head, but I just can't... I'll try to write everything as much as possible. I think my head's just gonna explode if I don't write this down.  I told myself that I wouldn't quit band until ninth grade is over, but this is just a freakin' hard promise to keep. After being in marching camp for five days, I have decided to throw in the towel. I just don't like band any more. Band used to be fun back in 6th, 7th and 8th grade, but once you start 9th grade, the world of band just becomes so different. It's a lot of hard work, and I'm just not having fun as much as I used to have. I mean, I don't like marching bands, but I enjoy concert bands. If you had a choice between marching band and concert band, then I'd sure as heck choose concert. I just loathe marching, and I'm not good at it. I lose my balance, and I can't play and march at the same time. I also have trouble keeping up with the tempo.  I just want to move on. I've already had the band experience for three long years. It was a very fuggin' nice and awesome experience, but it's time to see new things. I'll make my own decisions, and I won't let my friends influence me into staying in band. Sure, marching band looks like a lot of fun, but not everything is as it seems. In order to have fun in this marching crap, you have to work really, really hard, and when you work that hard, the fun is gone. I sure as heck had a lot of fun in eighth grade, and I enjoyed band back then. I thought marching band was gonna be fun, but then I found out it isn't.  If I let my friends make the choices for me and make me stay in band, I won't enjoy it. I mean, band just doesn't mean anything for me anymore. I hate having to practice the flute, and I can barely play the music these folks have given me. I could surely stay in marching band all the way through senior year, I sure as heck could. But the problem would be that I wouldn't be enjoying it, and I would not practice and hate every moment of it. So that's why I'm not staying in band any more. I'm so fuggin' happy right now.  So I talked to my parents. My mom told me it was the right thing to do, and that she wasn't very happy that I had chosen marching band in the first place. Why? Because of all the pressure and stuff. See, band gives you your P.E. and Fine Arts credits. So to cover for the Fine Arts credits, I'll take Art. P.E. will be a problem. I don't wanna have to take P.E., but if I have to, I will. Another way is that I can choose golf, one of my favorite sports. Though, I don't know what I have to do in order to be able to get in... I really hope I can get inside some golf club or something... I don't wanna have to take P.E. =X  Don't you dare to think that I didn't give any fuggin' thought to this decision. It was really hard to make...honest. I don't wanna quit, but the other part of me tells me I have to. Right now I have people telling me to not quit...saying that I'm a wimp, a loser and stuff like that. They just have no fuggin' clue how scared I am. They're not gonna change my choice. It's about me, not them. I could really care less on whether they want me to quit or not.  As I was talking to Keely-san and Sally-chan (they were the ones telling me not to quit), I became unsure of myself. Did I really want to quit? Was I making the right decision? Are they right and I'm wrong? All those questions started to pop up in my head. Sally-chan showed me pictures of what I was going to miss out...all those band trips, skipping class for going to contests and other endless stuff. They were trying to convince me on staying...and I was sure as heck falling for that.  So I was undecided. That almost never happens to me. Once I make a decision, I know I'm making the right one no matter what. At that moment, no one was supporting me...except Michael-kun. Yes, folks, he's quitting too for the same reason as I am: too much preassure. He, as of then, was the only one that was thinking like me...and of course my parents gave me support. But Keely-san and Sally-chan weren't helping at all... They even said they wouldn't talk to me any longer. That made me feel all alone and without any friends.  Since I was getting kind of upset with those two, I left the conversation. I talked with my mom, feeling so weak because of what Keely and Sally had said. My mom talked to me again, telling me to follow what my mind was saying, not what my friends want me to do. She told me that if I didn't quit now, I'd be dreading band for the rest of the year, and I sure as heck don't want that. My dad also talked to me over the phone, encouraging me to quit if I really wanted to. Once again, I felt better. I was now sure that I was going to quit band once and for all. Not friggin' friend was going to make me unsure again.  I got dressed and wore my musical shirt...just for irony. Since we didn't have morning or afternoon rehearsal, we were gonna have one at 6 PM. My mom was gonna take me there so I could tell Mr. Shine that I wasn't gonna be in band any more. Before I left, though, Ms. Callaway called me about the flute lessons. She asked me if I wanted to have them tomorrow or wait until school starts. I told her neither, because I was gonna quit band and I had already talked to my parents. She just said, "Noooooo, why?!" I told her I didn't like it any more, then she asked me if it was ok to give my spot to another student. I said it was alright. Last, Ms. Callaway told me that if I changed my mind, that I could call her so she could fit me in schedule. Pfft, like that's ever gonna happen.  When I got to the Panther Stadium, Jessica-san [W] came up to me and told me that she didn't want to be here. I said, "Well, I'm just gonna tell a band director that I'm gonna quit band and I'm leaving."  "Oh my gosh, you are soooo lucky! You get to have your life back!" That's right, folks, Jessica-san doesn't like band either. She wants to quit, but her parents don't let her. They tell her that she's going to regret it, and that she'll be mad at herself for having quit band.  "Well, if I regret it then it'll be my fault and I'll blame myself for this... It's my life, not theirs!" Sucks... I wish she could quit. It must blow to be in band when you don't like it. I felt lucky right then.  So I looked around for a band director, and Jessica-san went with me. Soon I saw Mr. Shine walking, and so I told him that I was gonna quit band. He seemed ok with it, and didn't ask me many questions, except my name and what instrument I played. He also said that right now was a good time to quit: right before school started. Once Mr. Shine told me it was alright, I ran to look for Jessica-san, 'cause she had gone to the restroom. When she came out, I told her the good news, and once again reminded me how lucky I was. I was so fuggin' happy that I was jumping around like an idiot.  When Jessica-san and I went back to the stadium, I saw Sally-chan. I exclaimed, "Sally, I told him! I got out of band!" and gave her a two thumbs-up. She just said, "BOOOO!!!" I really don't know how this is gonna affect my friendship with all my band friends... I really hope it doesn't change... I don't want for it to change.  "C'mon, Sally! Give me a hug!" She didn't say anything. I could just see that she was fuggin' upset. The good thing was that Yaqui-chan wasn't there...or Michelle-chan. I wonder how they'll react? They'll probably be mad at me, too, but hopefully this madness will stop soon.  "Ok, Sally! Say good-bye to Daniela!" said Jessica-san. This is the best day of my life. I'm free. I feel careless and so hyper. I said my good-bye's to Jessica-san and Sally-chan, then left the stadium. My life had just started.  I will never regret this choice. My friends can show-off and complain to me about band, but I won't care. Being in band was a great, awesome, and incredible experience. I met a lot of friends because of band, and I owe it one. But it's time to move on and see other things. Band is not life, and life is not band. There's no turning back now.
