It sort of feels like the movie  Groundhog's Day , because almost the exact same thing happens every morning.  1. My alarm goes off at 6am.  2. I hit "snooze" until about 6:20am 3. I get up to go to the bathroom  4. Go back to bed resolving to sleep until 6:35am. 5. Magically, it is 7:30am, also known as The time I should be leaving for work!  It's terrible, and it happens every single day, which has made me about 15-20 minutes late for work every day. No one has said anything, but still not really good for the image either.  ****************** Yesterday, I got the new  Entertainment Weekly  in the mail, and I noticed an article featuring a list of guilty pleasures. Most of them, I could at least understand...hey, to each his own, but I do vehemently disagree with the addition of Kevin Costner and Peter Cetera to the list! Gross. (sidenote: am I the only person on the continent who HATES Peter Cetera?) If I didn't hate Tom Cruise so much right now, I would be more outraged.  But alas, I shall just make a list of guilty pleasures of my own!  1. Saved by the Bell 2. Danny Bonaduce 3. The short-lived New Leave it to Beaver 4. Cheesy romance novels 5. Freddie Prinze Jr. 6. TLC's A Wedding Story 7. Dr. Phil 8. Dr. Phil's son, Jay McGraw 9. Sharon Osbourne's talk show 10. The Real World 11. Britney Spears 12. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen 13. 7th Heaven 14. Days of Our Lives
