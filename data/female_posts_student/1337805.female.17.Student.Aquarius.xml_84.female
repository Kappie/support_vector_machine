I'm starting to give punk music a chance....:O HIT ME! I dunno why, but maybe I can have some fun being a punk now. I'm planning dying my hair too... It's either going to be pink and purple, or blonde, or red, or turquiose with black streaks, or brown and turquoise streaks. Comments, anyone?  *name has been changed for very personal reasons
