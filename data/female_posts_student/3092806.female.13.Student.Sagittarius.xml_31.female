I'm so tired of all of this that this second I could just pack up all of my things, walk out of my house, and never look back. Oh, I'm feeling terrible inside... I'm seriously sorry for ruining this blog with my petty suicidal thoughts and rather unfocused feelings, but I can't help it! My life is driving me absolutely insane at the moment and I hate it... I don't like NOT being in control. I hate being me. It really, really hurts... It's not only my social interaction deprivation but it's everything else. It's my love life, my parents, my sister, my friends, school, Camp, things online... Oh, it's everything... I wish things could just slow down at the moment so I could stand back and take everything one step at a time or go really fast so that everything is over before I'd know it. If only wishes came true!    Okay, with my romance life thingy, I REALLY, REALLY like this guy but it's like he'll never see me. I never get to see him and whenever I do, he is always laughing with a bunch of other girls. What sucks the most is that I know I can never have him even as a friend because we come from such different social groups and I wouldn't exactly fit in with his group. Another thing is, I'm not the least bit attractive. I'm SOOO ugly. I wear the same baggy things over and over again... I've liked him for a really long time. I've never told anyone this of course... Anyways, it really hurts because I can't stop looking around for his face every single place that I go to. It's so annoying and whenever I see him my heart practically melts...    Then there is my EBGF. One summer, when we were little we climbed onto his roof and watched the fireworks that my city does every Fourth of July, up there. It was beautiful up there. I had loads of fun and I was sort of hoping that somehow this summer, we could have done that again. I know that we're not friends or anything and I know it was kind of stupid to think that it would actually happen, but I don't know, I just wanted it to happen so badly... I miss having someone who's not apart of my family but is my friend and has known me almost my entire life... Like someone that could totally get me... And my EBGF used to be that for me.    There is so much more, but I have no time to write the rest of them down. God, I just wish my anger would take a walk for once.
