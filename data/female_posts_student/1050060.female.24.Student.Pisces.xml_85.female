I think I will be going home for Easter this year. Then I will be back for my last two exams on the 16th of April. On the 17th I will be going home for the summer. Can't wait for that....I am tired of studying all the time.   Amanda will be coming to Fredericton next weekend. I can't wait to see her. I haven't seen her since Christmas. We will be going out to some bar here in town. I haven't went out in a long time. Anyways that's all for now. Have a good weekend!
