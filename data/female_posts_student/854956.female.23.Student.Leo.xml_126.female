Several attendants and ushers or only one of each?  Probably several... I have too many friends to pick just ONE... 3.  Outside or Inside Wedding?  INSIDE... I wouldn't want a wedding in the rain (like my brother's) 4.  Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall wedding?  I'll most likely get married in the summer, but I've always liked the idea of a winter wedding... :-) 5.  Big or small wedding?  Towards the bigger end of the spectrum, but people that have big weddings would call mine smallish... 6.  Morning, afternoon, or evening wedding?  Afternoon w/ an evening reception... 7.  At the reception:  dinner or finger foods?  Dinner 8.  Hire a band or a dj?  BOTH!  I'd want a band for all the important dance stuff between groom/bride/father of the bride/mother of the groom stuff and a DJ for the other people to have a party... 9.  Flowers on corsages:  fresh or silk?  I'm going with silk, just because it's easier to keep them w/o having to dry and press them... 10.  Wedding Ceremony:  Short or long?  Short ceremony, long reception... :-)
