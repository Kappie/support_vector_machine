She spends her life in Adelaide, South Australia, and she studies at  urlLink Flinders University  to complete a Master of International Business Administration. She hopes to graduate in 2 years but knowing how lazy she is, she might be a student when she'll be 40!!  Anyway, the story starts; Adeline has completed the first semester of her degree and she has met a lot of very nice people in her class from different culture and background.  She is now on holidyas for a few weeks and she will take the opportunity to go to Sydney to welcome her sister Maud who is staying there to study for a year at the  urlLink University of New South Wales .  She will try to share with you all her adventures and stories during her stay in Australia. Don't hesitate to live comments (in any language, she will call for an interpretor in case she doesn't understand!!).  Have a great read and don't forget to enjoy your life!
