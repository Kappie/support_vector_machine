Lindsey always gets on my cussing and "border line" language, but tonight when Kasey was like filthed mouthed and i was like "Lindsey wouldnt like to hear you talking like that Kase" he just kinda laughed and Jake was like "why would she care??" i was like "Lindsey doesnt cuss" and Kasey goes "she almost did at her birthday party!" and Jake was like "she does on AIM!! like when she saw my 'hairdownthere' screen name, she was like 'What the Fu**!!' and she always cusses other times too" i just kinda was like "oh, i didnt know that" i think Kasey noticed it bugged me cuz he changed the subject after that. but why would Lindsey get all on MY case when she does it too? even using the F word! i NEVER use that word, unless i am super upset or in trouble. another thing that kinda bugged me was her listening to Korn. she was all like "i listened to it the other night and it was Satan!' so she broke the cd and said she wouldnt listen to it anymore! she promised me and i promised her i wouldnt listen to secular music AT ALL when she only gave up Korn, now, i know she loves them and its hard for her.... but if it was so bad for her to listen to it the other night like it was Satan then why did she listen to it LAST NIGHT!??!!? or whenever?! but, it was after the Satan thing! i dont know, that just confuses me... and i have been trying so hard with this Christian only thing, which is really hard, like tonight at Kasey's he put on a cd and i was like "i cant listen to secular music" and he was like "WHAT!!? why?" and i just go "Lindsey and i have a deal, im doing it for her" and he was like "thats stupid" and turned it up louder and pulled me over to the speaker and was all like "listen to it, isnt it nice?" in his freaky Satan voice... i dont know, its just not making much sense. i really just hope Lindsey isnt lying to me, cuz that would really burn...well, i gtg... bye!
