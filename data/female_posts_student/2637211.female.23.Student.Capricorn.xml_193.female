Then I scolded him for only doing things if he was the best at it. No one reads this anyway, but ideas? Opinions? I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I will probably need to actually publicize my site or something. We'll see. I just think it would be interesting to write exclusively about history/politics/media/television, and keep my personal rants here. I also think it would be good practice for writing and journalism, if I really want to pursue that at all.
