Codine should only be saved for special occasions  I'm so done.....and this is supposed to be a happy moment and it's so quiet . No applause, no ballons, simply a Video tape  with more vulnerability on it then I'll ever show in my poetry.   I don't get to walk until next year but that's ok, because it'll give me a chance to plan a party a huge one! I'm done with undergad...and it only took 5 years........   Cheers to the next 5
