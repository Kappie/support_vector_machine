I'M FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!    Wait....... I still have Regents.....  DAMMIT, CARTMAN !!! *sigh* Oh well... at least tomorrow is a dress-down day.  I'LL BE ROCKING MUH JEANS, BABY BAY-BAY ! Anyways, I'm getting my working papers today... well... actually... here's how the rest of my week looks...    Today After School  Prepare for Regents tomorrow. Fix cuts on my arm. Call Brandi. Drink iced tea. Clean room and vaccuum hallway (maybe).   Wednesday  Take Regents. Come home around 11 or 12 in the afternoon and enjoy my vacation so far since Mr. Johnson and Ms. Sassine didn't give us summer work.   Thursday  Work at Pantry at church giving out food to the needy like I will be doing every Tuesday and Thursday for the summer. Chat on computer and update my story. By then, I should be allowed on.   Friday  Try to relax. Call friends up. Use computer.    Saturday  Look for job at the ASPCA habilitating cats. I looked it up today. Volunteering with animals ROCKS!! They said all I have to do is commit for 8 hours a week for at least six months. I can go every Satuday once school starts and this summer I can go Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, or maybe just Mondays and Wednesdays for 4 hours a day... or LONGER!! KITTIES!!! WEEE!!!! Enjoy vacation.     Excuse me, I need to finish looking up my summer volunteer program. :)    -SmoOkie
