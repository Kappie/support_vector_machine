And I think I'm going to continue calling him that, cause I think it makes him feel special. (Hey Bob, take care of my soul, will ya? Don't let it go through the wash, i dont want it to drown:P) Rob heh, he knows. And that was interesting.  he asked me what we should do about it. I panicked. I never gave that thought...I was only thinking about youth group and the whiskey (wee), not the future...And there's so many little things to worry about...Classes and youth group, and everything.. I'm glad I get until friday to think about this, he does too. We agreed.
