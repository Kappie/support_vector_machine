First similarity, the natives are all treated like nonhuman. The army destroyed a village for they like surfing there, and hundreds of natives die or injured. In the book, the British also treat Aricans as ants, they think the natives are insignificant objects, there(natives) life depends on the mood of British. Secondly, both US army and British are going crazy. The madness in their minds cause a lot of problems, such ass: killing people, destroying the enviroment. Even more, they suicide. That proove they are totally insane, they are no defferent barbarians. Thirdly, the description of jungle are pretty much the same:dark, specture, sombre, eeire, dangerous, blooming, damp. The settingmakes readers think of indefinable unsureof the enviroment.
