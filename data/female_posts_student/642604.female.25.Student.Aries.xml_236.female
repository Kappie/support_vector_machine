I got the packet of stuff I needed to know for my entrance exams and for my entrance audition and decided to take the T home.  I managed to make it through yet another day without a cigarette but it was pretty difficult today.  I saw everyone outside the main building smoking where I used to smoke and I wanted one so badly I had to go across the street and buy a pack of gum just so I had something to chew on.  But it was driving me crazy.  Anyway, so there isn't much to tell, at one point today it felt like spring weather, but it wasn't really since it was just barely above 30 degrees but in comparison to the weather we've been having it was gorgeous.  Then of course I come out of one of the meetings for orientation to find it snowing and that the weather dropped significantly.  Damn it.  And it's just dropping from there.  I hear we'll be back below 0 soon enough.  Anyway, I need to get back to rehearsing and then get to bed, I have to get up early in the morning.  Wish me luck!
