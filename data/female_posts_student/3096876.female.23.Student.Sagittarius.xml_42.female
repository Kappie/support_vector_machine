I figure I'll just live as a sun-tanning ascetic, living off the generosity of friends, family members, the government...heck, whoever will give me money!  OK, teeny lie.  I'm back at work today (much to my chagrin) but had an excellent time while off.  So excellent that I really couldn't justify spending any time in my dank basement to download tunes, or email, or blog...   hee-hee-hee-oops !  So now I'm back at work, back to abusing the resources made available to me...tit-for-tat, I think.  And I've got the perspective needed, now that I'm back in hell, to appreciate the very good time I had while off work.  Hmm...  Friday night: went to Sharkeys (!!!) with Mike and some of his friends.  It was a great night, even though everyone there was at least two or three years younger than me ( this is especially odd in that I was partying in the same spot as many of my friends'  younger  siblings--like Bridget's little bro!  I don't suppose he's really "little" anymore, but in my eyes he'll probably always be the bratty little punk that always gave us a hard time whenever Bridge  I hung out at her place .)  In terms of hanging out with Mike, it totally confirmed my suspicion that going to a bar and partying with your boyfriend is absolutely the most fun.  Brent  I never did that, except on my 19th birthday (which I do not remember...) and on that fateful night at the Madison when things really started to fall apart.  It always seemed like a really big source of fun and socializing that he  I missed out on, so it's really nice to be able to do this with Mike.  In fact, it's really nice to do a lot of things with Mike.  We went to the Georgetown Highland games on the weekend, and we're going to the zoo next weekend.  It's really...nice.   Where's my thesaurus...?
