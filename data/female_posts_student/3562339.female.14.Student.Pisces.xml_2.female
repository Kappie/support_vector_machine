Everyone came other than Jamie, cause he had friends over, and S'rah, who apparently never said she could come considering it's her birthday, but apparently, I have hearing problems when it comes to the phone.  Can and can't sound very much alike you know.  Anyways, everyone came in little groups that kind of amused me.  Both people from Villanova, Sam and Rachel came together.  All the guy Narbs came together, Faich, Tim, and Ben.  And that's about it for groups.  And I have no idea why I found that amusing.  *ponders*.  Anyways, we had food and stuff, even though we were a little behind schedule.  There was pizza, cake, and soda, all the necessities for a heart attack.  The pool was actually pretty clean, though it was kind of cold and Tim, Sam, Ben, Rachel, me, and finally Maggie and Sophie in the last half hour of the party actually swam and played games.  The other people just kind of hung out in the hammock and talked and ate and junk like that.  Mia didn't come until near the end of the party, and since she goes to a different school, only really talked to Sophie, my sis, and Dot.  It saddened me.  But eh, whatever.  And there were no teary good byes this time 'cause most of the people are going to Britta's party tomorrow.  w00t w00t.  Earlier that day I went to the mall and got some really cute capris from Aeropostale!  Shut up Alicia/Faich.  Then we went shopping for stuff for the party, like globe lights for the umbrella, and citronella tikis/candles.  The tikis were set all around the pool and looked really pretty at night.  There may have been a fire hazard considering the trees, lol.  But even with all the citronella filling the air, I still got like 2 mosquito bites.  Grrr.  But that's not nearly as many as I got at Tim's party!  Yay!  Hope you guys had as much fun as I did!  ...la Gu
