I can't say the s word coz some diarylander might come over and...do bad stuff to me. I'm paranoid,see. Ok, I'm supposed to be at Tribune now but I was half an hour late and the tyrant Ms Chia was there. She scolded me before and I swear her spit flew onto my cheek. Geez...she needs to go for anger management sessions for like forever...sheesh. Not that we'd miss her or anything. That old hag always says no to what we tribuners do. It's supposed to be the student's voice, not the freaking teacher's voice. Goddammit she wears too much makeup. Her mascara could like bury the Great Pyramid. Ok that was lame but never mind.   Oh my god... I'm like so damn tired lorz. You know last week I didn't even have one day off but i think last week was the best damn week i'm gonna have in ages. I gort a sayang in sec 2 here in rg(Kak Syazwani) and my other boy sayang Paul ;P kept calling me. He's so damn cute! Btw he's from ri. So now you know who Paul is and why I'm so damn crazy about him. I have like so much to say but to keep the suspense I shall start from the beginning. ON Sunday last week all the Malay peepz from rg and ri had this Malay Society CIP thingie. We invited some kids from Mendaki to come over to ri to have a day of fun. Btw, they're all orphans so we had to be super-super nice to them. I was a facillitator(all the sec-ones were) which means I had to look after all the kids in my group. They were from P1 to P6. THe lil ones loved me and they liked to jump on me suddnely to make me scream. Naughty fellers. Haz.   Dani said we could come the latest by 8.30 a.m. that Sunday so i did. Kak Fadz was there too and I almost wore the same pans as here. Phew. She had her shirt tucked in and so did i! Bzzt. Kak Atiqah gave my shirt and I changed. Then we gort into our groups. The first thing we did was play Wacko. Paul kept calling my name and since his name was the easiest to remember I kept saying his name too. I think I shall cut my hair soon. Suddenly. He changed into his shirt soon but he didn't get out of his ri pants. So exact orz. Then the kids came and we split them up into Sports and Aesthetics. So sad Paul was in Aesthetics but I was in Sports. It lasted two hours and then it was time to eat lunch. Finally. THe kids were all bugging me about lunch and saying that they didn't wanna play anymore. Btw, everybody kept mistaking me for one of the kids. I was really quiet lor so I guess it was like sort of true. SORT OF. Paul came back after lunch and we ate and ate and ate. Before we started eating, we had to wash our hands...according to Kak Fadz. She said cuci makan sebelum makan wifout realising and then she was paise lah when her group member I think pointed it out to her. SO i washed my hands...rite beside her coz she was supervising the sinks. Den when all the kids were gone she put her arm on my hip and then asked me if I'm tired. Yuck... this sounds censored lorz. Then she put her face close to mine and then asked me if I'm tired or not and I said yea. Duh. I was so high after that...so embarrassing...*blushes bashfully*. After lunch was prayers and then the movie screening. The kids told me they wanted to go to the toilet and they were girls but I ahd no idea where the girl toilets in ri were. So Paul went with me and showed me. He waite duntil I came out with the kids!!! Then we went back to the hall to the movie screening. After the kids were given goodie bags, we went back to the halls for a telematch between all the groups. My group got 2nd. Kuning rox aniwaea. Then the sec 4s did some persembahans. Dani knows how to breakdance! So do some other ri guys but Dani's the best. Kak Fadz likes him... I think... and maybe he likes her back coz they were always sitting next to each other. *smiles* Kak Fadz sang I think. But her voice was really soft. According to my dear friend Natalie Tai my voice sounds like Kak Fadz's. COz I'm sick mah. Supposedly. *smiles agen* Imran can't sing, he so syiok sendiri...but he didn't care so I guess it was kinda cute. Hey btw I dun like any ri guy cept for PAUL!!! The others are so kental. Poor Raphael. He's a chs guy who's in my third lang class and I used to like him until Paul came along. *makes face* Hey during the concert Paul sat just beside me! Isn't that cool now??? Yurpz. Paul rox my sox...which are so low I can't see them if I look at someone else's view. *smiles* K gtg now...5:30 liao...the softball peepz are finishing soon. Kak RosFarina is in softball...and Kak Faz too!!! Btw Dani's in art. gym according to Arina. Hey guess what there are 3 coms at home and all of them are gonna have access to the interenet. But I carn use them now coz they're [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]. *smiles* gtg...agen. Cya!
