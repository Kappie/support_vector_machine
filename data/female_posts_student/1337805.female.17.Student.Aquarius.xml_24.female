He's been acting rather moody lately, and its been weeks since I've have a real conversation with him. Ever since I told him I had smoked pot, he wont talk to me. And even though he forgave me the other day, he still isn't the same fun loving Liam I know and love...He's different. First, he replys on MSN. You have to wait half a century, or threaten to leave to get him talking for a bit. Then he gets all moody when you call him on it. He won't answer the phone. And since we live no where near each other, and I'm going away the next 2 weeks, I won't be able to talk to him until the end of the month.  He claims he tried to kill himself on Friday, and that I should thank Kat that she stopped him. Well, I'm not even sure that I would have minded at this point...He's not the guy I used to know and love sooo much at all. I've deleted him off my list until I feel better about talking to him, or until he can grow up and tell me what he's feeling, like before, so I know and can help him...until then.
