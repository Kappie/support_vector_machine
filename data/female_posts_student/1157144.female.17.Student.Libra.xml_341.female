I'm planning to practically stick with Tyler all night long since I'm his date, and since it's his senior prom, and only my junior prom and whatevers. So if his friends are having pre-prom fun fun, then I'll be with them, and then I'll be sitting at their table for dinner @ prom, and I'll be with Tyler and his friends at their after-prom party, assuming they're having one. I just think it's fair that I stay with Tyler and don't ditch him and stuff, so as to make his senior prom memorable and stuff  junk like that. I'll try and find y'all at prom and stuff, and maybe I'll see y'all on the dance floor, heheheeee. But yeah, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, and get my explanation crap all out so it didn't seem like I was ditching everyone. I hope everyone understands, but yeah, okay, i'm done.   *did i mention that work to rule sucks major ass?
