Only after A tried it out first though ^^; (*G*G*G*G*) Anyways, turns out it's awesome and pretty and easy, unlike hotmail, soo... new email! Of course I'll still use  urlLink feuxfollet16@hotmail.com , because it's easier to remember and the 'normal' email, but this one is just cooler and more interesting...   So, here it is:  urlLink ei.thrd3ey@gmail.com
