I have heard about the sickly shade of green your eyes turn when things don't go your way. Well I damn you again. Don't you come back here, or else I might get mad again, and if you remember what happened last time, you'll remember that neither of us came out well in the end. So go on! Git! Run away like the cursed dog you are. Beware of the violet eyes, glowing in the dark Me
