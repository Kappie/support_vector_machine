All for a mere amount of 50 cents  (I still pay children's tickets to the public pool, never yet been caught! haha)  I'm going on a trip to bintan with my family from May19-21.. Yippee!  Asked my best buddies J and M along... Really really hope that they can make it! M says that she has a project to hand up.. Hopefully she will be able to finish everything by then and go with me..  Its wierd that I'm actually feeling bored when my projects are done.. One more to go! Oh I forgot.. and exams too.. sheesh...  Think I gonna go take a nap.. It's been ages since I get to sleep properly.. Nitenite
