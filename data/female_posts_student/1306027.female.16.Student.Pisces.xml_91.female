Well that was an awesome movie..). Anyways back to the subject.  I am addicted to the internet. I don't just surf and chat. I mess with web design, I chat in aim, msn, and yahoo, I blog constantly, I surf, I email. So, maybe you can understand this deep conversation I had with my friend Lorraine earlier (note: this has been edited to fit into the space allotted.):  Me:  Blogger is all shiny and awesome now...  Me:  it's like xanga only you don't have to pay for it!  Me:  plus.. you can audio blog too  Lorraine:  meghan you amaze me  Lorraine:  Lol  Me:  I amaze myself. I think the weird you were looking for was "freak" or.. "weird" or... even... "You freaking weird nerd-dork!"  Me:  or..  Me:  word..  Me:  *cough*  Me:  let me retype that.  Me:  I amaze myself. I think the word you were looking for was "freak" or.. "weird" or... even... "You freaking weird nerd-dork!"  Lorraine:  you just surprise me with your knowledge of things like that among other things  Lorraine:  when your day revovles mostly around insipid conversations  Lorraine:  you get surprised by more meaningful ones  Me:  *blinks*  Me:  Wow, that was deep.  Me:  lol.  Me:  and yes- I do get surprised by meaningful conversations.  Lorraine:  lol  Lorraine:  yes...things like that come out sometimes  Me:  And when they do... woah buddy... someone, somewhere is definitely cringing with almost indefinable terror...  Lorraine:  lol more than likely if I ever said something like that to people I'm around they would just give me a blank look  Lorraine:  don't know if that would be better or worse  Me:  Lol  Me:  I would crack up  Me:  and then say "I been vacationing with the Dali- don't mind my zen reasoning"  Me:  and then that would get an even blanker look  Me:  and perhaps a "Who's Dali??"  Lorraine:  omg  Lorraine:  lol  Yea, so maybe the Dali-zen reasoning reference was faulty, but I mean, if someone has to ask who the Dali is than are they really going to know what zen reasoning is? I bet you 5 bucks they don't give a flying monkey poo about either. That's just how it is these days. We are kids- we aren't supposed to care about anything. We're just supposed to have fun and explore ourselves and make mistakes that we should learn from . I can't tell you how many times I have opened my mouth and speak, only to leave some poor adult in the dust. They call it "disrespectful". Well, gotta give some to earn some, buddy. How bout' a little love for the kids who work their butt's off only to be told that they are completely worthless at everything. Granted, a lot of kids could care less. But I do care. Some say that when you choose your path, your choosing all the stipulations of it too. I say- instead of making excuses for finding reasons to cut someone down, take a step back, and take a good long look at yourself. Are you perfect? No. Did you make mistakes? Sure. So what gives you the right to judge somebody? Seriously, that's God's job. Not yours.  Does this have a direction? Not particularly. Want to guess why?   Because nobody cares..   Now, you may be saying "How very manic depressive of you Meghan." Maybe. Or maybe, I'm just flushing my mind. Kurt Vonnegut did it in  Breakfast of Champions , granted, he did it in a completely different manner. And his flushings were actually published in paperback. Mine- well, they are temporarily suspended in an internet browser.  Hehe, I realize that some of you want to shove a sock in my mouth and tape it shut right about now, and I would probably offer no resistance, but, somewhere, someone will read my blog and have the inspiration to use too many commas. Or perhaps even, just maybe, write about TICTM.    I leave you with this... Neo killed my cell.
