Opened your eyes in a darkened room  You melted into my sweet embrace  Felt your eyes try to open me  Myself reflected in your face.    Took the last of your innocence  Made you mine for one night  Let myself fall into the darkness  Abandoned truth and right    Tasting sweet, seductive sin  Knowing it was wrong  Words whispered in the hot, flickering light  Should be forgotten by the dawn.    My tongue felt your sweet crimson life  My fingers felt your heat  Fed my ardeur from deep within  Conscience lay dying in defeat    Never kept against your will  Not becoming a slave in my bed  My heart is mine, and mine alone.  You can have my body instead.      ~fin~      A/N: Request, Tonight, Unclean, and Whore all refer to a friend I slept with who just happened to be my ex-boyfriend's sister. Oops. We're still good friends. All three of us. I have no idea why I wrote so much about one rather meaningless night...
