Not enough to pay the $65.00 ticket price (horror!), but definately enough to take advantage of a free ticket (won in a radio contest by friend's sister but sister had prior engagement that night) and a chance to head out to the Tweeter Center venue.  So friend and I are in the dark surrounded by swooning 20-year-olds women and their equally swooning mothers and grandmas.  It was a good concert.  He sang stuff in Italian, Spanish, and perhaps Portuguese that I couldn't understand, but it sounded impressive.  He sang the stuff in English that I've heard before.  Once he sang "You Raise Me Up," friend and I figured we had heard all the stuff we wanted to hear, it was 10 PM, and we had hospital work in the morning.  Let the true fans sit out the 3 or 4 encores.  Yes, I know someone out there may want to beat me up for not savoring every moment of the concert.  But, y'all, as much as I luv me some deep male voices ::shivers up spine:: I can only stand so much Italian.
