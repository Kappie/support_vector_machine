I have tried my best to avoid this, but i love him.There is a downside to this, however. My parents want me abstinent from relationships until I am 16. I say abstinent because i have been rather prominent in the dating world throughout the past two years. Now i must be single as a long-stemmed rose in a glass vase. So, I'll let him know the news when he arrives home in a week or two. He'll be tired and probably sleep for a few days at home before I see him, but i'll let him know. I won't defy my mother's rules. At all. So there's the end to it. And I'm okay with that.
