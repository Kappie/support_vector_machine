Anyways, today I skipped part of the morning session because it was basically orientation for the people that weren't at camp last week. That made me a little perturbed, so at about 10:15 I went home and mowed the lawn and showered off and went back to camp after lunch. The rest of the day was pretty much a normal day at band camp. Normal. Right.      Last song I listened to:   25 Or 6 To 4  by Chicago.   Last album I listened to:   The Very Best Of Chicago: Only The Beginning .   Last meal I ate:  Salisbury steak and fries with gravy.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I returned to band camp yet again.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Crackers plus saliva yields... You complete the reaction equation, Dan :P.   Last person I talked to:  Dan.   Favorite song today:   Things Goin' On  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.   Favorite food today:  Fries and gravy.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Um. Stuff.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Paul brought a gas mask to band camp in case of a biological attack :P.
