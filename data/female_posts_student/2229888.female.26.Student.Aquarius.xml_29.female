I said horrible things to my mother out of anger . . . i have later apologized and had my apologies excepted as well . . .    The epiphany revealed itself before the apologies and after my inexcusable behaviour . . . i was extremely angered toward my mother after she declared before myself and two of my siblings that she doesn't care for us . . . she used a more crude device to relate this term that i won't attempt repeating . . .      At our age, I suppose it shouldn't matter much whether our mother cares for us . . . but it does and weighs heavily on me as well as my brothers and sister . . . she's decided that we are horrible selfish children that are attempting to marr her happiness after she gave up so much for us . . . this so bristled me that i said a few choice and hurtful things in response . . .  i felt satisfied with this for only a moment before pangs of guilt presented themselves to me . . .  i then listened to she and my brother recourse and realized through hearing this exchange, that it is fruitless to attempt changing her opinion, and idiotic to spout mean words for temporary satisfaction . . . the epiphany??????   We are no longer going to argue, but accept . . . accept and go on with our lives . . . why does this seem a huge and new idea to me????  everything in my personality rejects this course of action . . . i don't like accepting and moving on, but last night i realized the road that would be carved if i continued would be a bitter one, and those suffering in it's shadow would include not only my mother, but myself and those who love me . . .   so here i am . . . accepting . . . .and moving on . . .  la la la la la :)
