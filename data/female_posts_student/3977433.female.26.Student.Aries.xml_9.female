I want  ROMANCE  and kindness, sweetness and thoughtfulness...I want to feel deep down inside something, a spark, a light of some kind. I want to have fun, and smile. I need someone to do little things for me,  ALL THE TIME . I don't want to have to remind people to do nice things for me...Because really that makes me feel horrible that I have to remind someone to do something so simple yet so meaningful to  ME . I want surprise ecards/cards and flowers, letters in the mail. I want to be able to talk and hold an interesting conversation about things that I like. I want to play chess again with someone. I want people in my life that are at the same maturity level, and filter out gossip, name calling, backstabbing, lying, all those horrible things that I just don't want around me. I want to have creativity back into my life by someone or by my own accord...But I need someone to be able to do things that interest me and get my brain working on overtime (for good reasons).  I need to feel that I'm living every day to the fullest, alone or with someone. I want to be wanted. And I want all these things all the time...Not just for a little while..Or until the  'effect'  has worn off. So far I haven't been able to find these things.  Now, for these things my search begins.     Feeling: Sore Watching: Beetlejuice
