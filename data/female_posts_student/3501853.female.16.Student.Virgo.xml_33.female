I wanna talk to Kev soon cuz I know he's sad and I feel somewhat the way he does..but we havent really hung out cuz either I'm busy or he's busy with others so =\..  last thing bugging me is my mom's having a really stressful week at work and since her new car won't come til next week [ya im pissed bout that still but o well u cant fix it] so she still has to like give me the car and we have to deal with making plans based around each other then she has to wait up for me and stuff and this is selfish but i can't go out in the day only at night so she has to wait up and get home early for me argggh i feel like an inconvenience 2 her but then agian, i dont wanna be stuck at home..  argh, im gonna go paint then sleep cuz saves the day is 2morrow...
