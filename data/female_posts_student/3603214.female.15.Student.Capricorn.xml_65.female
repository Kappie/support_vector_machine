Imagine there's no countries It isn't hard to do Nothing to kill or die for And no religion too Imagine all the people Living life in peace...  You may say I'm a dreamer But I'm not the only one I hope someday you'll join us And the world will be as one  Imagine no possessions I wonder if you can No need for greed or hunger A brotherhood of man Imagine all the people Sharing all the world...  You may say I'm a dreamer But I'm not the only one I hope someday you'll join us And the world will live as one   *there's a shirt at the Peace Frogs store @ Mills that has John Lennon on the front and the chorus to Imagine on the back...I was going to get it, but I'm poor...it was WAY hott...
