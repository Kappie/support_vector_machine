Not to mention, when I looked in the paper this morning, if I had done my time, I would have come out fifth. The fastest I had to go was 12:06 to make it into the meet, I could have done that time in my sleep last year. I can just hear the others - she just had freshman luck. Good thing my calves kill today. Anyway, reading my comics, waiting for sis to get up so we can go to church.....
