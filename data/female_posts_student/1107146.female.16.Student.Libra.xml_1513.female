Josh I feel sorry for you, first your girlfriend leaves for Junaluska (thank you for the correction) and then Rosie finds out that you weren't at church.  you have my sincere apologies.    Congraulations RosiePosieTaoTaoTheRabbit,  you have learned to speak your mind clearly and pass fourth grade.  Why do you care if Josh misses church? What does it matter to you?  If Josh is damned to Hell for missing church, that just means you'll just get to hang out with him in the afterlife Miss "I'll never be perfect again".  And if Josh needs to "be shot for missing Sunday Worship"  I'm sure the devil will oblige him.  Why do you want to shoot him anyway?  Do you want to speed his voyage to Eternal Damnation?  Or will getting shot save him?  Is being murdered by a crazed Chinese religious zealot good enough to get you into Heaven?  Do you really want to find out?  Seeing as the answer to the last question was no, why don't you ask why he wasn't at church instead of threatening his life, it wouldn't piss me off quite so much, and it might illicit a more proactive answer from Josh.
