And although you may not see it,  I have a lot to hide.  Behind my clothes the secrets lie,  behind my smile, I softly cry.  Please look a little deeper, a nod maybe you will see. The lonely little girl,  that lives inside of me. Please listen carefully to her,  she'll show that she is insecure Please try to be a friend to her, and show her that you care.  Please just get to know her,  and maybe you will see. That if you just look deep enough,  you'll find the real me.   (great poem, not written by me)
