I say that now, but I'm sure once school starts, I'll be dying for Early Week. I mentioned in an email earlier that I like busy, as long as it's scheduled busy, but I'm starting to question that. I'm a serious planner, I hate fuzzy plans, but I'm starting to get some spontaneous. I think it's because my mom is actually letting me. Joining Guard was probably the best thing to happen to me, because there are so many last minute things that aren't optional.  I'm insanely happy I didn't work today, even thought Sundays are slow and fun. Breaktime. I'm almost dreading going back to work, because I've been away so long. At heart, I'm a lazy bum. If the manager hadn't taken away all my reasons for quitting, I would. As soon as I save enough money to add to my growing pile of possessions. I hope we don't move any time soon, I've gotten complacent. I used to be able to pack my room in four boxes, not including the two in storage, but I don't think I could do it anymore. In the six months since I moved here, I've become a complete different person. It's weird, because I crave routine and regiment, but I die if I'm in one place for too long. It keeps me from growing.  Yeah, I think the reason I don't freak out whenever we move is a) because moving is part of the yearly routine and b) my room basically stays the same. Because I DO freak out when my computer is screwed with or somebody moves something on my wall. Since my room stays constant, I can deal with moving it to another part of the town/state/country. I have a feeling we'll be moving in January. Our lease here was for six months, so I figured we'd be moving after that, but we didn't. I'm fine as long as we stay in West Fork. It may be a small town, but I'm committed now. And I refuse to drop all my activities. I already had to do it once. Anyway, my mom thinks we might be here for awhile, at least until I graduate. She doesn't like moving any more than I do. Her dad was in the Air Force.  Tara's moving. To college. Tomorrow. I don't want her to go, it's already different. I know we won't talk as much, we already don't. It's killing me. Jeff was over at her house. She said it was "a goodbye thing". I don't want to know. I don't want her to tell me. I won't freak out again, that was a one-time thing, but I'm still pretty pissed. I want her to make the right decisions but I can't really influence her.  I have no tact, by the way, as evidenced by this:  nay the obscure (9:56:50 PM): [12:51:26] Happily Damned: I only hate you because you're stupid, Nadine. A Thing for Jaz (9:58:00 PM): Hm. It means very, very little coming from me, but I don't think you're stupid. You're the only person who sees through my crap. nay the obscure (9:58:01 PM): :'-( A Thing for Jaz (9:59:13 PM): You aren't stupid. I can see why people would hate you, but that's because of noncompatible personalities.A  Thing for Jaz (9:59:40 PM): Wow, I always manage to say the wrong thing... nay the obscure (9:59:55 PM): yeah, I was thinking that... nay the obscure (9:59:56 PM): =p A Thing for Jaz (10:00:12 PM): Wait, you were thinking that I always say the wrong thing? That's funny! nay the obscure (10:00:29 PM): why is it funny. nay the obscure (10:00:36 PM): if it is TRUE!!!!????!!!??!!!?!?!?!?!?!?  I mean, I knew I had no tact, but to have another person say it...I've been trying to keep my mouth shut when I know I'm about to say something tactless, but it doesn't happen. I've been getting worse lately.  Oh, and I've been getting WAY better at controlling my public stupidity. I managed to get through a conversation with Monica without completely going crazy. I need somebody to like, follow me around and smack me when I say dumb things. I mentioned that at the pool party the other day and Monica smacks me in the head and goes, "Shut up." Monica's great.  Yesterday, Jenny says, "Can you stand up if I do this?" and kicked me in the back of the knee. I had my knees locked at the time and like, fell to my knees. I have a huge bruise now, it's hurting to sit. She apologized, and I know she didn't mean to hurt me, so we're OK. But if it happens again, that is IT. Ooh, which reminds me. Conversation I had:  Me: OK, you know what, do that again and I'm going to open up a can. Her: What? Me: A can. Her: Of what?  I've decided to wait to get my ears pierced until my second check. I called my dad and got like 40 dollars towards my contact exam. That was another amusing conversation. Anyway, that gives me about forty more to spend on clothes. I screwed around with my money last year and didn't buy stuff I needed. This year, I'm not making the same mistake.  I need to get started on Dae's rainbow necklace today. I need to mail the bracelet I made her in the first place. Damn lack of stamps.
