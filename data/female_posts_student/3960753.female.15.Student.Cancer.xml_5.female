First, we haven't finished our project in English, which will be submitted tomorrow! My friend, Jerelynn and Russell was left by their bus. And me and my other friends were stuck in school because of the rain. So what we all tease each other and do some crazy stuff. The only thing we did is to talk, chat, talk, and chat the whole afternoon, we were the only one left in school because it's halfday.      It was almost quarter to 3 so we all just recorded our voice in the radio, and we dubbed all afternoon. We was so noisy that the teachers in the faculty room almost heard us. But we still talked and talked. We were getting really noisy, so our school directress ( which we call the "penguin" ) heard us and started calling Mang Bhay ( our school's head janitor ) when we heard her voice, me and my friends started running, and we hid at the back of our school's canteen, but "BULAGA" one of our janitor in school saw us. So we all run to get our bag and head off the school's gate. I was getting my radio so I was at their back when our english teacher saw me. I acted as if I didn't heard her, but I saw her furious face so I ran to catch up with my friends.     We were in the gate and were trying to find some umbrellas we can use to protect our head and our uniform from the rain. Then when we had a glance from our back we saw "THE PENGUIN" coming, so even wothout umbrellas we ran in the streets with only a folder on our head.      So we thought were free from "BAD LUCK" but we were wrong, we were all WRONG, when we was walking on the side of the street, this F****** jeepney splashed a mud in our skirts!      THE END grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
