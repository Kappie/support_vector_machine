He kept stealing my purse. Then i got insanely bored in French class. We seem to be doing the same thing over and over and over...again and again and again...well you get my point. It's driving me insane!!! Then I insanely amused at lunch because of Nick again. Ummm...oh in english today this guy came to the door and her told Miss Notti to make Ashley Barton colse her eyes and when she did he gave her pink roses! How sweet! I don't even think they were going out. Wow...good thoughs... Ah getting too sappy! Anyway, band was alright. We have a concert coming up and the stu[id people STILL don't know their parts! Science was better then usual. wasn't watching the clock as much. And I have my rock collection done and I probably should finish my book for English. Still not nervious. As soon as I put on the dress I will...
