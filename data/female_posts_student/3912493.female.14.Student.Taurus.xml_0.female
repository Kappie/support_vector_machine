Ms. F gave all of the All-Region band members the music that they're supposed to learn before the AR Concert. You're supposed to learn this music by yourself because some time on January, there'll be this huge band rehearsal with your AR band and you'll practice the songs there. Of course, they won't teach you the rhythms because you were supposed to do that by yourself, but whatever. I didn't look at the pieces at all. That's right, folks, I was  sight-reading  on the rehearsals because I didn't want to look at that stupid music. What music was it? Here it is: Sons of Liberty, Arranged by Larry Neeck ; Music From CARMEN, Geoges Bizet but arranged by Richard Saucedo ; A Song of Hope by James Swearingen ; and Under an Irish Sky by Larry Neeck. Though, just two days before the "Big Rehearsal," they decided that we weren't gonna play Under an Irish Sky, so they decided to switch that to Nevada Expedition by Alan Lee Silva, which was a much harder piece to learn. It didn't really matter for me, though, 'cause I hadn't bothered to look at the music. Well, yeah, I looked at it, but just to number the measures. w00t, I rock. The All-Region concert was gonna be some time in January.  Friday, January 16, 2004 - All-Region Band Clinic 'Tis the day of the AR Band rehearsal... or clinic, whatever. It started at about 4.30 or 5 PM, and it lasted to about 8 or 9. The Symphonic had it on the auditorium of Reed Middle School, and the Concert Band on the band hall. Oh... my... fuggin'... goddess. What a pain in the neck was to rehearse in this place. We played for a whole lot of time, and we only had breaks of 5 or 10 minutes. Can you believe that?! They were trying to kill us! Of course, like I have said before, I was sight-reading the whole time, and sometimes I didn't even play. =P My butt was aching the whole time because I couldn't stand up. Oh... the horror. The percussionists sucked (Shaw-san and Erica-san would have kick arse) and the saxophones didn't have a good sound (here's where So-Young would have been the star). I was so fuggin' tired at the end of the day. We sounded kind of good, but to me it wasn't good enough.   Saturday, January 17, 2004 - All-Region Concert This is where you find out that the AR Tryouts and making it to an AR Band is not worth your time nor your effort. Before the AR Concert we had another rehearsal, which was about 5 - 7 hours (a pain, eh?). We were the second band to play (the concert was at around 7 PM in the Alexander Auditorium), and lemme tell you this: the Concert band played way better than us. But I guess it's reasonable, since their music is easier than the one we have. Our concert sucked. In Songs of Liberty the flutes weren't playing at all in this part where they had the melody with clarinets. There was only one clarinet playing at that time, which was Elias. Then Sarah B came along, then Ciarra, Michelle and so on. It was horrible. Ms. Payne, the director for the Symphonic band (she was a really nice director, by the way, too bad we couldn't give her all of our energy), kept humming the rhythm so that a flute could come in, and she finally whispered, "Sarah, someone come in!" And that's where Sarah B caught up. What a shame. Some of the songs were good, though, like Music from Carmen (oh my goddess, that song rawked!), Under an Irish Sky and parts of Sons of Liberty. Nevada Expedition was ok, but at the end we sucked. Of course, what can you expect when the AR people throw you a piece of music which is uber hard and they expect you to learn it in two days? Not much.  We finished the concert and we headed back down the steps. As we were exiting, this lady was pulling patches out of this bag. Patches. We got patches for being on an AR Band. After all those months of working hard and preparing for the AR tryouts, endless chair tests and yellings from your band director, then wasting two fuggin' darn days sitting on your darn butts on a fuggin' seat for most of the day playing some stupid music, we receive a fuggin' patch that says this: ALL-REGION BAND, JHS/MS 03-04. Darn you all. Darn you all stupid and moronic fools who came up with this bullcrap known as All-Region Tryouts. First of all, this patch doesn't even tell you what band you made. What about the chair that you got? Nope. How about at least your initials? Nothing! Not a darn thing about what you made on AR or about you was on that pathetic excuse for a patch! So, as I looked at it with disappointment with my friends, I said, "This? This is what we get after our hard work?" Then this lady came up to my shoulder, who obviously was eavesdropping, and said, "And it's worth every penny." Screw you, you fugtard! It's not even worth a darn penny to tryout for this crap. She doesn't know what pain and trouble we went through in this AR crap, so she thinks that we, or maybe I should speak for myself, are satisfied with some crappy patch. Darn you all. I pity myself for having worked hard on trying to beat Michelle on AR tryouts. Why? It was not worth it, and now I'm kind of glad that I didn't get a better chair than her. Maybe I wouldn't have pushed myself so hard and wouldn't have been disappointed if I knew that my reward would be a crappy patch.
