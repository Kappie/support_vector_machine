Maybe it's because I just didn't go to sleep last night..hmm.... I think i might keep this for my own private viewing for a little while..and then i will show myself to the world..ha yeah.   Yeah well...speaking of weed...? yeah i dunno..my parents recently found out that I have been a "shmokin da reefa". Yeah it was pretty bad.  Damn those blood tests. My mom was really mad. Well more sad than mad. She cried. I cried. We all cried.  I had to keep assuring her that I was not a drug addict and that i did not need to go to drug rehab.  I feel really bad.  I'm not a bad person. It's really weird when your parents know that kind of shit about you. I'm not going to smoke anymore.  I get random drug tests now! YAY! Everything's cool now.  My mom jokes around about me being a pot-head (which i am SO not). I just can't lie to her. She is extremely against lying.    "He" hasn't called in 2 days. Damn those boys.  I swear..i have the WORST luck with guys.  They all either A. have girlfriends          B. are cock heads ( like the certain guy with thick ankles bah)          C. aren't even interested          D. are ugly (sorry but hey..i guess i'm shallow..i dunno)          E. or ALL OF THE ABOVE! and i know there are more choices!   I give up on guys.  Seventeen years old, and i have NEVER in my life had a boyfriend.  I have finally come to the conclusion that i don't want one. I don't need one. Yeah..i'll just keep telling myself that. I'll stick to the flings and the random hook ups...they're fine with me.   I looked for chalk again today. Not a single peice. Really pissed me off.  What does someone have to do for chalk around this damn house.  Sorry..i will stop venting about chalk.    I must go work on yearbook. ahh yes..designing spreads..mmmmmmm..i think i'm hungry too....
