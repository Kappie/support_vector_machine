Like all the guys are a foot taller and actually half decent! Amazing. Harry, where to start. He is as funny as ever, he used to have such a possy voice in P.S. And now, now, he is like really, really deep. I mean, i used to do like duets with him and stuff, and i just can't believe how different he and his voiceis. I forgot that Eleanor was such a nice hilarious person. Eleanor is like the knife that cuts the tension. She is soo funny, most of the night we just sat there remembering old times, getting half way through a story and bursting out in laughter. She reminded me of the time Max got a pen up his butt, Shima got a pen up her nose, James sat on pip's arm and broke it and the infamous time when Lazar, on September 11 (terrorist attacks) said to Eleanor "I know who the terrorist was. I will tell you if you if you kiss me. Or even just pat me." Eleanor responded by patting him, and the next second, he scouted the area around them, slowly leant towards her and whispered "Mike...". Lol. Vanessa was as sophisticated as ever. Laura and Karlie are identical. So qte. Luke has a mini 'fro. Sarah is so gorgus...Wiso! Wiso know1 believes that chris actually became popular-they just laughed unbelievingly.  Good times...  LOluv CM
