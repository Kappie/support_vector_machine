Today Holli and Alex came over and we hung ou   t   . We rode bikes down to Amanda's house. Amanda is in Utah. Utah is a state. Holli is jaded, according to Al   e   x. MOMMY, WHEN WILL DINNER BE READY? The answer....PRETTY SOON. Chloe embarrassed herself today. She    j   iggled her boobs as she walked into the computer room, and she saw Alex. I suppose she forgot that Alex was here. Alex is a freak! She ate all the flavors    o   f the nasty Harry Potter jelly beans....without even flinching! Me, on the other hand, had a vomit one, and I almo   s   t did just that. It was gross. Hmm...well t   h   at is about it for now.
