We saw uhh.. Jaze, Jon, Santi, and Richard there. That's about it. hah I ran out of tickets really fast, so I went up to some ppl that I sorta knew and this one dude gave me a lot of tickets... it was pretty cool. My throat hurts bad from screaming on the rides so much. We were up there for about 3 or 4 hours. It got old really fast! I have a bad headache right now, it sucks. I should go to bed.. goodnight!
