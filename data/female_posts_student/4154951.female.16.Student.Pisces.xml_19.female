Now I'm listening to And I Love Her... All the Beatles songs were so sweet back in the 60s...      Listening to Boys again.... So suss... OMG, I have nothing to blog about! And I have like 5 minutes left!! I really should be doing my Society essay about Personal Reflection.. But nyehh.      Hold Me Tight... *sigh sigh sigh sigh*      OMG I seriously can't talk about anything... I don't even have any Useless Camille facts! *overdramatic gasp* I'm gonna sign out...
