Seriously-my new roommates and I have only known each other for 48 hours, and we're already talking like old friends.  It is definitely a comfortable situation.  We're all so much alike, as far as study habits/living environment/social environment, it's not even funny.  They seem to be a lot like me, studious and responsible, but not afraid to let lose and have fun on the weekends (or even occasionally during the week, lol, as Jess proved tonight-coming home drunk after a night out w/ her internship buddies, the girl had 8 vodka tonics and was still able to walk AND talk AND was NOT puking-why can't I be more like that?! Why not, bc I have a toilet at IHOP that loves me...hehehehe).  In addition, they like to cook, clean, and enjoy watching reality television in addition to being addicted to HGTV (as am I)-why couldn't I have had them as roommates LAST semester? :o) Needless to say, I'm very happy w/ the situation.    Class tonight was by far the worst one of the semester-one of the guys summed it up by saying that he didn't think there was any activity that could have been more painful than that 3 hour class! So boring, so dry! Information that I have heard a million times, partly thanks to Poli-Sci 312 at UIUC-it's like a longer, more boring version of that, if such a thing is possible (Amy A. and Diller would tell you it's not) Oh well, that's why I'm glad that this particular class, despite its dull nature, has some of the most gorgeous guys I've ever seen on campus. DAMN. The hottest one of all, named Dan, is someone that I could seriously sit and watch all day, and to top it off, he's so nice.  It's a shame this is his last semester, but oh well. I'm interested in someone else-but every girl needs good eye candy. Enough drooling for one evening on that account.  Oh, and I talked to Victoria tonight, we caught up on life in general and since I hadn't talked to her in a week or so, I told her the gory details of the hellish roommate situation.  (I swear, does anyone else have such random things happen to them? I think not.)  She was, of course, shocked by the horrific details, but was pleased that I had been removed from the situation.  She expressed similar sentiments as Natalie and Krissa did, by saying, "OMG-get the hell out of there!" Don't worry, I AM! :o) Anyway, yay for her and Natalie coming to visit next weekend! At least they won't build a fort...  Oh, and my sister was in town tonight! She was downtown next to the Crown Plaza w/ some of her fellow KC students, they're in town for a student presentation there tomorrow, so I got an opportunity to go and visit w/ her. Yaaaayyy for that, despite our different personalities, me and Lori are really close.  It reminded me of KC and similar trips for StuCo...great memories :o)--we had so much fun! So many crazy  stories...if they wanted to, any of my fellow StuCo officers from my sophomore year could probably ruin any potential political career of mine before it even started-but just like the UIUC CR's, we have made a pact-what happened in Centralia, stays in Centralia (similar to Champaign)-although, there is still a questionable videotape out there (don't get excited, it's not porn, thank you-none of us are Paris Hilton wannabes)-but we won't discuss that any further.  Ty, if you're reading this, here's hoping that tape has long since been DESTROYED! I know it contained many priceless memories *AHEM* of our KC glory days, but here's hoping that it has gone up in flames-for all of our sakes!  Anyway, with that said, I do believe it's time for some sleep-it's gonna be a hectic weekend, studying, thesis proposal work, actually WORKING at FB, in addition to Superbowl fun at Dempsey's. So night ya'll, go getcha some! Sleep, that is! What did you think I was talking about, you perv!
