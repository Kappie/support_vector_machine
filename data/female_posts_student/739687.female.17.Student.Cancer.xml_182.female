"Life isn't one damn thing after another...it's the same damn thing over and over."  Trying to figure out where I heard that quote.  Yeah, so, had a family discussion...well, that is, my mom, my brother and I. It wasn't a happy family discussion either...it was a depressing one. Like ones I remember from about a year ago. When shit around here sucked. Gah, none of us know what to do anymore. I sure as hell don't know what to do. I mean, I tried a year ago to solve things, and it obviously got me back to square one. It's like...not in my hands.  Sometimes it takes something seemingly bad to make things better.  You know what it's like to see someone who has just wasted away life? Like someone that is just like a perfect picture of hopelessness? Doesn't someone like that just...make you so depressed? Just to see someone like that...it brings your heart down...it makes you just sink a little. What if you had to see someone like that every day? The same person just wasting their life away? It drags you down...and I am being drug down day after day after day. I can't live with that anymore. I just can't do it. Two years of it is enough to drive a person to feel that their own life is hopeless. It's like watching a depressing movie over and over and over and over and over. After a while, everything just seems completely hopless and depressing. I mean, wouldn't that melancholy repetition just get to you? Life should be a more pleasant balance...sure, drama is necessary once in a while, to keep a person interested.  Anyways, the point I'm trying to get at is that being around such hopeless people all the time can have a horrible effect on a person. I wanna come home to a house that isn't a picture of such hopeless depression. And I want to be surrounded by people who are at least  somewhat  hopeful and optimistic.  Gah, that's all the ranting n such for today. Very sorry...I just had to vent a bit. Adios you crazies.
