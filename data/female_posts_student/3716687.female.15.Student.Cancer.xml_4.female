That's right, I will no longer claim Calvin Presbyterian as  my church  anymore. Anyone who was involved in youth group or the 4th of July "program" knows why I am leaving, and there are very few words that describe the joy of getting out of that congregation.   Today Nicole comes and gets me, we go back to her house, and take our time because we think that kempsville is right next to Lynnhaven. Well guess what.  It freaking isn't.  It tooks us almost a half hour to get to the movie theater, where we were supposed to see a movie with mike and several other people. But, as soon as we get there (which was 20 minutes late) we're told that the movie sold out. SOLD OUT!!!! Of course I'm pissed off and had already had a countless amount of dissapointments this week, and was on the verge of tears. Nicole said come on we're going to the beach.   After 20 minutes of driving and some old school Weezer, I was calmed down quite a bit. We parked at Nicole's Aunt Mita's house, and walked with surfboards in arm down to the beach.  Now, the time I had gone surfing before didn't work out very well because it was extremely flat. But, today there were decent waves. I stood up twice, and bruised myself a thousand times that. I did alright for someone who's only surfed once. I do say, it's addicting.  I come home to my grandma's house and ate some sushi (which at this point I'm thinking hey, things are gonna look up). Yeah, well they didn't.  I get a call from my mom saying our choir director, whom I've already told that I would not be at our old church for a rehearsal before the program because I'd be at my church, has decided that he  is  going to have rehearsal at the time I'd be at my church. After an hour and a half of being told to shut up, stop talking about it and being threated to having any contact with my friends taken away, my mom finally said it's your decision, do as planned. I don't give a flying cracker if I upset the stupid choir.  I've made every single rehearsal, I'm the only one who has, and this really isn't my responsibility.  I was volunteered by my mother to play in this program.   Enough complaining about the crap going on, I'm out.  -Allison
