Without faith I am lost To turn my cheek Has a cost What I believe Wont shine through My heart is blinded When I talk with you I cant say Goodbye to you Goodbye To everything I knew Goodbye To all the things I hold on to I have the will Yet, still I cant find my way Whats right is left And left is wrong I sing the words And talk the song I scream in silence And talk in tears I live in faith And dream in prayers
