It seems that alot of us have our lives so packed with activites, that we forget what its all about.     Why do we have Valentine's day?   I think its to fill the void of time between Christmas / New Years and Easter. Lets think about it... it provides us a chance to run to the super market and load up on more junk food than we should eat in a year, and oh yeah, if you are single you are shunned by our commercialized culture. All we need now is a day to celebrate the single life... think about it... Valentines: couples, Easter: cute children (ie family), The Fouth: Family cookout..., Labor: day at the beach with the kids, Thanksgiving: dinner with your family and then there is Christmas... again a family event. The only "single friendly" holidays out there are 1) New Years (but tough to get out w/ no date) and 2) St. Patrick's Day (where is the fun outside of Savanah  Chicago... (definately not much in Valdosta). Now some could argue that Marti Gras is a single's event - but the idea of flashing my chest for a collection of cheap plastic beads made in China just doesn't ring my fancy. What we need is a day where we celebrate the indiviuality of singles and allow for them to go out with no "hitched" folks around... Just my opinion, I may just be bitter at the moment.    This blog should be titled www.i-need-a-real-life.com.  Well, I did get to hang out with some friends tonight... that was fun.  Just some thoughts. Anyway... So, yeah I gave Miranda the "scoope" on me - actually the guy I've been interested in the last few years... I feel good about getting it off my chest... She is the first person I've told, and maybe she can knock some sense into either me or him. I talked to Martyne about "unfollowed apologies" by the one guy that has given me such hell. She said... "maybe he just had to get it off his mind, he knew he had done wrong and he had to clear his conscience." Why hadn't I thought of that... Makes sense to me.   I just had screaming thought crash into my brain. THE FORMAL!!!!!! Oh my god... BREATHE Liz.....! I have never, ever had a guy ask me to a formal. I have always asked. I really really really want a guy (that is halfway decent) to ask me out to this. I deserve it!  I am a good girl that just wants to be treated like all the other girls  that I see get asked out on a regular basis. When Kim and I talked after her breakup of Fall 03, she said she was asked out by 11 different guys... damn. That is about my life total. I have helped every roommate I've ever had get a date, and I have worked hard to keep other friends together - including driving to other cities to "chat" and "knock sense" into folks, holding heads while they were sick in the toliet because they had tried to drink away relationship problems, listened as they have bitched about thier ex, held friends while they cried, needed help with papers, school, family, money, car, GRE, Regents, proofreading, WHATEVER!!!! My God! I am tired. I think I need to spend some time on me!!! I have beaten myself silly trying to help others, and here I am, 22 and have yet to be formally asked to a formal (and believe it or not, I have never been formally asked on a date, as in "I would like to take you to dinner/movie/play/concert/ballgame." I have had alot of "lets hang out", "lets grab a bite to eat right fast" and of course the dreaded "would you please hook up with me" or "can we go to a bar". What the fuck? Do I have a tshirt on that yells SLUT? I didnt think so. That shirt lives in, well, i wont say it, ____'s closet. I never ever want another guy to come up to me at a party and say "lets go to my place [wink wink]".  Gary once said that any activity you have one on one with a guy is a date.. but I dont think I believe that anymore. Sometimes there is no intention of dating, but just to hang out for company. Just a date, just a date to the formal- thats all I ask.  Gosh, that was a fast vent. I feel better now... I wonder if, when I read this tomorrow I will agree with it all, I just typed very fast, spilling the first thing that came to mind onto the "paper".   Moving on... I killed a possum this week. I really feel bad for the critter. He had the bad judgement to cross the road in the rain right in front of me, I still feel completely ill when I think about - I can still hear the crushing bones. Ugh. No critter deserves that. Flash to today, I was driving back to the school from Wendy's when, on Baytree, there was car heading right towards me in my lane. I just came to a stop, as did the truck beside me... and I really thought this oncoming car would never see me. She did, and then swerved back onto her side of the road, missing yet another vehicle by what I would guess 7 inches. It really could have been a disaster. My question is: where are all those VPD cars when something like this happens? Some people do not need to drive... end of story.  College life... ITS SO DAMN CONFUSING.  Goodnight.
