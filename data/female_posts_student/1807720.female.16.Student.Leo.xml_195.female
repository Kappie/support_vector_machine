I came across a very reputable website that described what EXACTLY matches me.  I mean EXACTLY.  It totally describes me, it's really scary just how 'dead on' it is.  Conceptual/Holistic Processing Disability:   When your weakness is in the conceptual/holistic area, you probably can memorize details and facts pretty well but really struggle to understand deeper meaning and general concepts. You may read rather quickly and easily but have difficulty understanding what you have read.     For this type of disability it is most important to take extra time to try to develop a deeper understanding of what you are learning. Although you may finish assignments quickly, you need to spend extra time to figure out why each assignment was important and what you really learned.    The following may be most suitable for you:   1.  Extra instruction  about underlying concepts and deeper meaning. Why is this information important?   2.  Overviews  and summaries to provide context before and after lessons.   3.   Concrete visual aids  (drawings, charts, video, etc.) to help understand the "big picture".   4.   Extra time for thinking  through tests and assignments.  5. Textbooks and assignments with  highlighting  of the most important information and concepts.  6.  Hands-on experiences to use your other senses to learn.   7.  Reduced assignments to avoid feeling overwhelmed.   8.   Concrete examples  and/or demonstrations.   9.   Linking information  to real-life situations.   10.  Encouragement  to go beyond superficial understanding.   11.  Clarification and repetition  of concepts.   12.  Outlines  listing key points and concepts.     And here are some things you can do for yourself:   1. Take more time searching for deeper meaning after completing assignments.   2. Pay attention, watching and listening for any important information you may need.   3. Ask for explanation when you don't understand concepts or meaning.   4. When reading, stop after each paragraph to see if you understood what you read.   5. Take time to break large assignments into smaller(manageable)pieces   This sounds just like me.  EXACTLY like me.  Especially the part about memorizing the details and not understanding them.  That's EXACTLY what I do for social.  When they give us the long answer questions, I write out the answer and then memorize what I am going to write.  This way it seems like I know the information, but really I just memorized it without actually knowing the meaning or understanding.  And the part about finishing assignments quickly, but not understanding is just like me too.  I do the assignments, but I don't really learn anything because I just plainly 'answered' the questions without actually understanding them or going through what they actually mean.   I like concrete examples because I learn from totally structured environments, and often I do need time on tests and stuff like that.  I usually need clarification and ask questions beyond the original information presented - so that one basically hits me dead on.  It's so scary how accurate this is.  Also, this might explain why reading comprehension is so bloody difficult.  It's so true that I can read, I mean reading is not my problem.  My problem is understanding what I have read, which makes it very difficult to answer comprehension questions.  Maybe I have some sort of processing problem, which is why a lot of things are difficult and school can often be frustrating.
