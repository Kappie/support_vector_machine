Joey said that Nima asked her and she said she didn't have any feelings for him. Now, I felt really sorry for him. What made me confused was that, they were going out and she didnt have any feelings for him. Later Konica told me that she told her that she was using him and was planning to dump him before graduation. I didn't know what was going on. Now, I really really felt sorry for him. Some say that he gets what he deserves, but I don't think that. I mean, I don't think it's his fault for having feelings for someone. You can't help from liking someone. Sometimes, it's just a feeling, your mind can't tell you to stop, because your heart keeps on telling you to. So I don't think he deserve anything.   Later Konica told me that someone told her that they weren't going out. Now, my head hurted. But her not liking him was true. If they were going out, Joey said that I should tell him. I said I couldn't do that because I didn't want to interfere with any relationships, except that relate to me. A lot of people told me to tell him. I didn't want to, actually I couldn't. Either way I'm not.   My friends say that I shouldn't even feel sorry for him at all. One of the o4` said that now he's going to know how I felt. I said, "I don't want him to go through what I went through." I know that sounded lame, but I was serious. When I think about it now, I don't even know what I went through, but I know it wasn't happy thoughts or memories. But my friends got me through it, even when I thought I couldn't. Yasi finally made me spill the beans. She knew I wasn't well about everything that was happening. I finally told her that I was lying to her. I felt really bad. I was always telling her that I was alright. When really, I wasn't. I was in some points in my life, and some points I wasn't. Different feelings always mess me up. She said she knew what I meant, she's so understanding. Same with everyone else. I feel so lucky to have friends that care about me so much. Even when it's about the littlest or dumbest things ever.   Nima and Joey, my best friend and sis, are doing well, well duh. Anyone who can't see that has some issues. I feel so happy for them both. I mean, some people can't find that love at an age like this. But they did, I'm greatful. Even though it's not happening to me. It's happening to them and it affects me in a way. It just makes me smile.   I guess that's what I wanted Safee to do. I just hope the rumours aren't true. I just want him happy, because I couldn't make him smile.
