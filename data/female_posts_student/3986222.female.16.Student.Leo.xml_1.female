I watched this with my little sister (actually she's not a little girl anymore, she has the same height as me!!! aaaahhhhh am i ever gonna grow??!!!) anyway, enough about my drama and let's proceed to my movie review of prince and me... I kinda liked the story. It will certainly give you that "kilig" factor that most especially the part when Eddie proposed to Julia Stiles (i'm sorry I forgot her name in the movie =) anyway, i could say it's stereotype because in the end they end up being together but the different thing about the story of this movie with the rest of the romantic-comedy genre is the situation of the girl. The cute thing about it, the prince was the one who was intimidated by the girl and the character of Julia Stiles did not leave the guy due to the heaven-and-earth, commoner-and-royalty difference, she left because she wanted to pursue her dreams. Well of course at first Eddie let her go and she went back to States but at the day of her graduation, he came and asked for a second chance because he is willing to wait. Well, as I said it turned out good. I could say that our 65 bucks is "kinda" worthit but... if I were you I'd wait it in the video to watch it. If you're the  hopeless romantic  (like muah!!!) well this movie is for you but for others who are looking for a deeper sense or meaning to this movie, you will not find it. Anyway, that's all folks and hope you liked my review. =)
