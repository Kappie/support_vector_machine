However, before he left, he gave me a kiss.  It was kinda unexpected but not really.  I had been getting the feeling he was going to do something like that soon.  But I had just seen him like fifteen minutes ago, so why didn't he do it then when he was busy doing something?  That boy can be random sometimes.  Anyway, my weekend was a relaxing one for once.  It was nice.  Sam and I both agree that I'm an empath too.  She wants to help me with it, but I dunno.  I don't see what it could do for me.  I have an appointment with the therapist this Thursday.  It's about time if you ask me.  Maybe I'll finally be able to get some stuff off my chest.  I don't like telling people my problems because I hate pity parties and I don't like looking for pity.  It doesn't do anything anyway.  But to be able to talk to someone and just have them listen and hopefully not say anything about it (except to tell me what kind of a person they think I am) is great.  I'd rather not tell my firnds my problems cuz I don't want them to worry about it.  I'd rather it just be me worrying about them cuz if I know they're worried about me and I really am an empath... I don't need all that worry.  Too much!!  Anyway, it's nice to know something about yourself though.  It just kinda scares me how deep I am in this empath thing...  The thing Sam had given me to read a while ago... I dunno, it's all kinda weird and I know because of this people are gonna start questioning my sanity, but I think I can make this believable.  Cuz what I've been going through has actually happened.  I need to stop reading Rachel's books.  ok I'm done rambling for today later dayz
