Just a night involving a lot of tequilla and fireflies...The pictures will be up soon.  I have to do one of the following first:  1: break down, learn html and get a real website of my own.  2: fight with geocities for more webspace  3. reorganize my entrire site.   But before I can do any of that I have to rejoin the world of people who type whilst sitting up.   PS: Hey Kimmie--quit stealing shit from my site.  My picture pages have been Picture Pages for a year and a half....grrr....
