Imagine the most horrible, wretched things you would want to say to your parents when you were in middle school, combined with the worst act you ever thought you could commit at that age, add the ego of your middle/high school's star quarterback or homecoming queen and multiply it times 50 children.  That is what my Thursday is like...then there are the other 4 days of the week.  Jason asked me tonight if I was happy with where I am in my career.  I responded with an unconvincing "sure."  Sigh.  What a mess my life is becoming.  Another 3 airlines followed suit today.  Now there's only 2 domestic airlines and the international airlines that are giving commission to the travel agents.  Please write a letter if you haven't yet.  Eventually I'll post a way you can email the airlines, too...not that they care.  I'm extra bitter tonight, it's been a long day, and this weekend will probably be mildly to moderately stressful and emotional, too.  Please AIM me if you get a chance.  I need a good cheering/morale boost.
