Woke up early to go to the softball tournament all the way in Jersey City- we won wahoo! I was there alll day!! then came home, showered and went to the bowling alley to see Matt for a while.  Nothing to exciting but Im kinda tired.  I just got back from Florida on Thursday night with the softball team! What an awesome time!! SOooo many funny moments!! haha Gotta love the NBC softball girls! Then, what's even crazier, is this time next week I'll be in Florida again with senior trip! Im so excited!! I got some color so Im no longer clear! I can't wait to get even darker.  There's been a lot going on in my head lately though.  I suppose I will share it in here since most people won't read it anyway.  Let's see, where to start.    Things have been getting crazier and crazier.  Im almost out of highschool and its so exciting yet so scarey.  In about four months, I'll be in college! California University of Pennsylvania here I come! yet- Im not sure I'm totally ready.  I am going to miss so many things about Northern and the relationships there.  I don't have many friends in the senior class- which is ok when it comes time to graduate because we're all going our seperate ways. Yet, I am pretty close with underclassmen and even a lot of teachers that Im going to miss.  It's going to be so weird not seeing them like I do now.  I know I can still keep in touch through email and I know I'll be back, but I guess it's just not the same.  Maybe Im scared I won't make any friends in college.  I think that's it.  I honestly don't think I have many friends in highschool.  I used to, but I guess I'm not good enough for them anymore. I don't really know honestly.  I grew apart from everyone.  As weird as it is... Im not really sure it is a bad thing.  I have come to realize who I am and what makes me happy but I honestly miss them. ALL.  I miss going out with the girls.  I don't have any girl friends that I hang out with outside of school.  It sucks.  I think that's making me fear that I won't have any friends in college- because I lost all mine in highschool.  It was weird, I roomed with Danni for the Florida trip.  We used to be best friends, then we stopped talking- long story.  Anyway, Danni and I hung out almost the whole trip.  It was like old times- which I guess is good and bad.  I miss what we had.  I honestly do.  I think Im a better person because I was able to find who I am since we stopped talking, yet... I still miss her.  She was my best friend... I don't even know what you could call us now honestly.  Oh well... I dunno anymore.  I can't wait to get away though, because I can't stand being in my house anymore.  It seems when Im here, I just get in trouble.  That's why I spend so much time at school- in the training room.  I fit in there. Im good at something, Im needed, the people understand me, I have fun.  I dunno... I want to be part of a group. I know Im part of groups now... like softball and the training crew and all, but I want a group that I see outside school.  I want that group of friends that you can hang out with, invite over- party with.  Im a senior in highschool and I've never been to a party.  I've never even been invited to one. It's rediculous.  I dunno... maybe I have too many regrets from highschool... maybe I'm just a dork. I dunno...   I think that's all Im going to post right now.. Maybe later I'll post on the Florida trip. I don't feel like it right now though.  Later!!
