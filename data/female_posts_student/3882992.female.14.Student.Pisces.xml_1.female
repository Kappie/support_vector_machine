I fall in love with the idea of lying down and having somebody to think about and have them also think about you. I fall in love with the idea of always having somebody there for you to hold and to kiss and to love you forever. But it's not love--it's the idea of it--that's why I fall so fast. I find myself very mental. I fall in love with the idea of love--I say thingsI don't even mean--I lose all the time and then it comes back again to bite me in the ass. I dont even know why I bother anymore. So I guess from this day forward I am promissing myself never to get hurt again, to protect my heart and to not let myslef fall in love or in love with the idea or whatever you want to call it. The reason is because even though I am slowly trying to recover from the death of a guy that I honestly did love with every ounce of my heart and soul---I don't want to feel like that again. With him it was different. I was never in love with the idea of love with him. I was in love with him. His eyes, his heart, his mind. Everything that he did I loved, because I loved him. I never want to feel like this ever again (even though I feel like this 24/7). I try to act happy--and from the wayI act you could never even tell. But whenever I am alone or I drift away from the world for a few seconds--tears form in my eyes--and in my heart.      Recently when I drifted away for a few seconds tears formed up. My friend kept askingme what was wrong but I just ignored it and told him that I got a mosquito in my eye. It happens to me all the time-the fact that I cannot accept to move on with my life and leave old thingsin the past. Butfor me the past makes my future. And without him there is no future for me. Death to me is a really funny thing. Because it makes you realize the small things around you. Like now for me--no more drumming sessions with him-no more sleepovers--no more talks--no nothing....     Death makes you realize deep thigns too--like what you lost and what to make of yourself and how the hell do you recooperate form this feeling. For me I was never a fast healer. Hell I am still trying to recover from my grandparents dying (that was in november) now I get dumped on with this??? What the fuck? Why does life or god or whatever life force there is out there, always pick on me? Why Lindsay? Why Ryan? Why the girl next door?          I swear if it were'nt for a talk I had with a friend one night (while watchin a really cool movie) I swear I would not be here writing this right now. So I will protect my heart--and save myself the trouble of nver falling in love again.Ever.....
