I'm very very sorry that I didn't write yesterday, except I was reading my book ( Windhaven , by George R R Martin and someone else, now finished) and just in general being a slob.   I did very well on my civics. This is good, because I like civics and I want to do well in that course. I think it's terribly fascinating. Maybe I'll be the next equivalent to Trudeau or something ^^; That'd be fun.   I hope everyone here hates Stephen Harper. If you don't hate that redneck leader of Conservatives you're not allowed here ^^; hee, no, I'll just be relatively icy cold to ya up until the election. Then, when the Liberals blow the Conservatives away, I'll be nice again. k?   I also saw  Kill Bill  yesterday. That is the most stupid and ridiculous movie I've ever seen in my life. It was all violence and fight scenes; no plot. Normally I wouldn't mind so much; fight scenes are cool. But these fight scenes  sucked ass . Honestly. Half the time those samurai kids were just jumping and waving their swords around. How is that fighting!! There were  at least  50 baddies, and they all insisted on fighting that yellow-headed chick ONE AT A TIME. How stupid can you get?!?!?!   And she was allowed onto a plane with a frikkin katana... jeeeeez. It was painfully unrealistic. I was disappointed.   Other than that though, I've got no news. Other that I am pissed at a few things. Mostly G. He said I looked like the lead singer from The Vines (what with my hair cut and all) (I agree with him, except he has no right to say so) (plus he said it in a demeaning way; I think it's cool) (stupid kid). And he didn't do the damn brochure so now S and I have to do it  on our own time  and we're gonna get sooo many marks off for it being so fucking late... I SHOULDN'T BE RESPONSIBLE. I WASN'T THERE. Ahhhh!!! I hate that kid. Stupid Giggles. Also I am mad that we have to eat lunch with our homerooms tomorrow. I hate my homeroom. Okay, I don't hate my homeroom -- I am just indifferent to it. As in, I have  no friends  in my homeroom  at all . Arghhh!!! Spending time with my homeroom is absolute hell.   Ok, I am finished with my self-pity ^^; You can all roll your eyes and make an ugly noise at me now. Byee!
