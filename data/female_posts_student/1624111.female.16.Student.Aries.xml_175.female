I dunno what it is, I dunno... but i definitely still like her better than (most?) other people. life is crazy like that i guess. with the not explaining to you why you feel certain ways... but thats okay. And i like this "coming over" concept... as opposed to spending forever trying to come up with something to do. perhaps i shall make use of this this summer. that will mean i have to clean my room thuogh....hmmm...  But you know what else i decided? If she and i only talked on a fairly regular basis we could still be really really crazy close. its not that any major change in either of us is keeping us apart or anything, its just...we need to talk more. and no classes/few classes/no mornings/big long list i could continue forever...makes it hard for us to talk a lot. so thats what im hoping for this summer. that we talk a lot. often. i want to have an amazlingly fun summer. with photo. and caitlin. and vacation. and Emily. and life in general. i hope, i hope, i hope. no big, bad shs to really get in the way too much.  and i love thunderstorms and im scared to drive on monday. test. yikes.  and...wow...so tired. i cant think if want i wanted to say on here...  i guess the main thing was to express my contentedness cause of seeing emily. yay. i love Emily. :-)
