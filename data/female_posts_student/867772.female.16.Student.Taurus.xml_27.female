I hope I'll find the one guy who was "meant to be" and get into some kind of realtionship with him someday. But until then, fuck boys. They make great friends, but if I know I'm not head over motherfucking heels in love, I don't think all the bullshit that comes along with dating is worth it. Not at all. People take everything so seriously. We're only motherfucking freshman at the motherfucking highschool. What's the big motherfucking deal?  I'm done, thank you for listening to my motherfucking ranting (If youre still actually reading..).  :P  On a less premenstrual note, I went to work with my mom the other day. She works in a theater, where a new musical, Marty, is showing. I met all these cool people. The main character was in the Perfect Storm (John C. Reilly), and I met him. The writers also wrote Annie, Bye Bye Birdie, and Applause. I met them too. Just to name a few. Everyone (almost) there is so nice. This made my previously shitty weekend.  The coolest part, though, was hanging out with my mom. Sounds pathetic, I know. But even if I claim to "hate that bitch to death" sometimes, I know I feel exactly the opposite. And it gets lonely when she's working 8AM to 12PM everyday except Monday, and she uses that day to fit in the week's shit-to-do. My daily conversation with my mother usually consists of a reminder to take the dogs out, feed the chickens (yes, chickens), move a load of laundry from the washer to the dryer, and make Bagel Bites for dinner, written on a used Dunkin Donuts napkin. We spent the day together. We showed up at the theater, and I helped her set up for the day. We went and got subs for lunch, which we ate at the table on the set. She had to work during rehersal, and I read my english book (or, the cliffnotes ;P). For dinner break, we walked around for a while, looking for something to waste our money on, and settled for Ben and Jerry's ice cream and Rolos. She got her dawgz to sneak me into the preview show that night, and lucky me, there was an empty seat in the front row. The show was awesome. It's going to Broadway after this, as well it should be.   We spent the day sneaking York Peppermint Patties from the crew's bag of candy.  The next day, she found time to take me shopping.  I feel like a spoiled little mothafucka.  LOVE YOU ALL----bbyz.
