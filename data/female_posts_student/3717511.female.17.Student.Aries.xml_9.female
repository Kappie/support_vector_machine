The pictures, drawn by a brother-sister duo, depict thin spindely figures with big eyes hovering over poor defenseless littlestick figures. According to the author of the site, three types of aliens exist: the Mantis aliens (these are the leaders of the plan for world domination), the Greys (the Mantis' bitches. they do all the dirty work), and the Reptilians. All of which are able to communicate telepathically. Using their powerful telepathy, the frail beings can subduedextrous humans and force them to comply to their evil will which is to breed icky hybrid offspringwho will replace the human race andtake over the earth. Luckily, if we all wear protective thought screen helmets this terrible fate can be avoided.   The website also features alovely step by step procedure to make a thought helmet, as well as some pictures and illustrations and riveting user testimonies. Oddly enough, my friend observed that none of the helmets seem to shield the frontal lobe of the brain, a region important in thought processing. She emailed the guy running the site. Ive posted it below.

Lining a leather "flyer cap" with 8 sheets of Velostat is effective. It works just as well as one that covers the forehead, plus it takes an hour less to make.I also make baseball caps lined with Velostat. I plan to put instructions for making them on my website before the end of the year. Abductees do feel safer in the leather hats than the baseball caps but the feel bettert wearing the baseball caps during the day.  Thanks for your interest,eamil me back if you have more questions.    Michael Menkin    The kook never did say WHY the hats work just as well when the frontal lobe is left naked. I know your hats dont work, you shifty little stinker. next i will ask him why he chose to make the hats from Velostat and how that acts to deflect the aliens sinister brain waves.
