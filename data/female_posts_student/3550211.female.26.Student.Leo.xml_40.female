Evidently the cable people have been hard at work. I'm sure that there was some significant and deathly important reason for this, but for the life of me I can't figure out what it is. In fact, I don't even care. All I know is that I now have to sit down and figure out where my favorite channels are hiding. Not the biggest deal in the world ... just a complete and total waste of time.
