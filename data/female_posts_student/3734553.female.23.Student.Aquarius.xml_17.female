I became close friends with a group of senior boys who were on the team, I was their little sister.  They drove me to and from school and just generally looked out for me.  After they graduated I lost touch with most of them, except for this one guy, Shaun.  He wasn't on the soccer team, but because he was close friends with the guys we got to know each other.    He was in a horrible car accident right before school started, and one day when one of the guys were driving me home we stopped by the hospital to see him.  It was the first time we meet.  But we got along really well, and he is just one of those people you can tell anything to.  So through out high school, I was a little rowdy.  And I would drink too much and then sit on the couch and talk to Shaun about everything, usually the screwed up relationships I was in.  And he always knew what I needed to hear.  I know he couldn't have been around that much because he was in college, but it seems like he was always there for me.    In college, we only spoke every few years (we both went to A).  Last year, right after I graduated he stopped by one day while he was in town.  I was leaving the next day for the Islands, and we could only talk for a while.  But I remember how shocked he was when we talked.  He kept saying over and over that I had grown up.  That I looked the same, but just sounded different.  It was strange.  And I hadn't seen him since then, until tonight.  He happened to come in with all the guys I used to run around with, most of them were married and with their wives.  We could only talk for a minute, but I am excited to hang out with him later this week and catch up.    My whole point is I am really bad about walking away from people.  When I graduated I only said goodbye to a handful of people.  And because I graduated early, no one knew what happened to me.  I left Krysten to answer all the questions.  And I wonder if I have lost some good friends because of my bad habits.  It was so great to see someone, who knows me so completely.  And no matter how much time passes between when I last spoke with him, he still knows me, and it was like we were together the day before.    It is said that the older you get the more you need the people who knew you when you were young and I guess it is true.  He has seen me at my worst, from a silly 14 yr old destroyed by a boyfriend, to a 21 yr old at 4am stressed out by finals.  And he still thinks the world of me and knows what advice to give me about boys.
