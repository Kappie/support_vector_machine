We have learned all the stuff, been tested on all of the stuff, and no it aaalllllllllllllllllllllllllll comes back to give us the most stress we have ever had in our teenage life!! Why??? No one ever will know, but as long as they keep coming, let's not freak out. I'm not as worried as before, but yes I'm freaking out! I mean, it is a test, we've done them all before. Now we just have more then usual and longer then usual. The point I'm trying to make is don't go on a panic attack. There's more stuff then usual, but after like a couple days, your partying hard! So show those exams whose boss! And Jesus is always there too! Remember... Love that's STRONGER, Love that COVERS SIN, and TAKES the WEIGHT of the WORLD . Yeah, the weight of the world, are the exams. Jesus will take that weight so don't worry! Be Happy! ok, that was Bob Marly
