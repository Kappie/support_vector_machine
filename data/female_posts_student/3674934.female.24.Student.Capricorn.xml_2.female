I am excited let me tell you. Feeling much better than i was last night although I do believe that feeling of dread may well return on thursday evening - when I am at work serving a zillion customers! My boss rang me today after my exam - which would have actually beeen during my exam had I not left so early - to ask me to work all day - wednesday I said uh NO! I used to love my boss up until 2 weeks ago - when she wrote me a note that absolutely floored me. Now no doubt if anyone is actually reading this you may think hey what she said is true but I was so upset (I am a wee bit on the sensitive side - and for some reason I just cant hack being told off by anyone other than my parents) Anyway the note said that she had never met anyone that is sick and grumpy and tired so often ( FYI I have had  maybe  6 days off in an entire year and 3 months - and at least 2 of those have been for exams) and that she is sick too - sick of my complaining! I had to read this not in front of her by the way. You know it probably doesnt sound that bad but she used to rant and rave about how fantastic I was always willing to do whatever whenever and now my the tables have turned. So basically the story is that I dont wish to be that social and jovial with her anymore - I dont want to know anything about her life and she's not to know anything about mine either. And all of this a night before my first exam - and I cried at work! How embarrassing - I didnt let her see though. I know that I'm being like a petulant child or something but she says I do it all the time?? Well then she's had a freakin year to tell me about it hasnt she??!! Ok I had better stop.  I tried on the bridesmaid dress - its perty darn nice I'm quite pleased to say that I even fit into the size 10 as well... I wish all clothes came in this particular label's sizing cos then everything I own would be a size 10 or less. Yay~ Anyway its quite exciting the bride has picked her dress and shoes and head piece, we all have our dresses and shoes sorted - all that has to happen now is the venue for the wedding and reception + dj + photographer... oh yeh and the catering and bouquets etc etc! I bet the bride is having so much fun :) She's actually quite happy I think - I did see her today - its a pity she lives 3 hours away. Ok off to do more study!
