Proverbs 31:30  Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting;  but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.    I love that verse. We can all try to be beautiful and everything but eventually that beauty will go away. What's gonna be left? Our character! I would work more on tyring to be a good person rather than trying to be tthe next Giselle. [a supermodel...]   Today I went to nordstrom. Like I said yesterday, shopping isn't fun anymore!! I managed to find one nice shirt that matched with my plaid pants so I am quite happy. Then I went to the shoe department but becuase my feet are so gargantuous they didn't have the shoes I wanted in my size! So they are shipping them in and I should have them on Monday. Haha.  Then we went to costco to get some stuff for this big barbeque my mom is having for her bible study. It's kinda funny how my mom chose the week everyone was going to be gone except for I to have her party. Haha. I am going to have to baby sit a zillion kids but oh well. It will be fun!! Little kids can be nice.. :)  I love to talk to them because they are so clueless about modern society. They don't care about politics, dating, or much except if they get there applesauce. I wish more people could be like that! But, alas, we all must face reality!!!  I wuv you alllll!  Laura Fantora  [P.S. Is anyone else having problems with the spell check? Mine doesn't seem to be working...]
