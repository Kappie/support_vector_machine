My mom was more excited about the end of school than I was.  She doesn't have to drive me down there again until August.  Wow, guys.  August.  We have no homework until August.  Why is this so weird to me?  This has happened, what, nine other times?  Oh, well.  I will get lazy and used to it.  I need to find stuff to do.  Let's see.  Focus on piano.  This means an hour a day, four or five times a week.  Do you know how much better I would get if I did that?  I'm gonna go for it.  That would rock.  Also, I am going to start running more often.  Listen to lots of music.  Oh, and you know I will make friends with the Blockbuster folk again this summer.  For a while, my mom and I referred to the employees using their first names.  We should just get Netflix already.  And what else?  Write stuff, read stuff.  And keep in touch with people!  I must spend time with all of you.  Don't stray too far. Hey, it's Thursday now.  Shit, I need to make sure my dad remembers to go to the Hawaii meeting tomorrow.  I am excited about the party!  Ok, I'm tired.
