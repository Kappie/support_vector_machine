Nothing out of the ordinary happened...besides the "dead people" walking around school today...that kinda bummed and creeped me out at the same time. Erika came over after school and we played a little volleyball-type thing with my sister with my giant red bouncy ball. It's amazing how many times we let the ball roll into the street before we realized that if we moved higher into the lawn that that probably wouldn't happen...lol. I decided to take a shot at asking my mom if I could drive around the neighborhood with Erika. That was a big NO. haha. Later, Jenn came and picked us up and we went to Jay Gees and got some ice cream. I got vanilla soft serve with extra gummi bears on top lol...lets just say i ate all the gummi bears and none of the ice cream...cuz thats how i do yo. lol There is officially 3 days until the Kiss Concert :)It's gonna be so much fun. I'm planning on meeting Maroon 5, The Calling, Jessica Simpson, Kimberly Locke, and possibly Avril Lavigne...cuz i'm curious to see if she really is a bitch. lol I'm pretty upset that Simple Plan isn't gonna be there this year...but I guess I can deal. I think thats all I have to say for today. I should get to bed now...Math MCAS in the morning...fricken awesome huh? NOT! Goodluck to everyone else who has to take them...hope u do better than I do! :) Peace out homie g dawgs yo.
