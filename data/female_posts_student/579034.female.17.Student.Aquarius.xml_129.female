I wish they had a creative wiriting class or something cause I mean the only class that really teaches you how to write is tied in with something I really don't want to do. Like, I'd take it for half a year and then I'd take something else and I relaly don't feel like doing that. Then there's Media which seems like it would be helpful cause I kinda wanna go into Journalism. I'm deffinitly doing Marketing and Finance and I wanted to do Web Design. I was gonna do Physics but I dunno, I'm a little shaky on that. I really don't want a science next year. I hate science. Ugga...   Decisions, decisions, decisions.  Tomorrow is Jr. Day of Renewal. Should be a truly holy experiance.
