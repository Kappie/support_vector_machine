I used to be able to compose entire entries in my mind.  I can no longer do that, I don't know what to expect when I sit down at the keyboard anymore.  My fingers do the typing almost before my mind knows what it is thinking.  It's odd but I learned to live with it.  I got used to the soothing flow of clicking keys and being able to watch my thoughts progress in front of me.  But even that is gone.  My days have become lazy, trivial at school and systematic at home.  I come home change my clothes and lie out in the sun reading for an hour, then I come in and shower and either go next door or settle down in front of the TV.  I eat dinner and then waste time pretending to do homework or talking online.  Nothing new has really happened, at least not worth recording.  I need something to inspire me.  I need some sort of muse.  hmmm, where can I find a muse?
