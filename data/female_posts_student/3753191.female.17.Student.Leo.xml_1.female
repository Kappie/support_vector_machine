So if you were expecting some kind of major rant against her, think again.    Leave the girl alone.  I am sick of reading posts online by (teenaged) Britney fans playing mothers and fathers to her.  She is not a child and if she cared whether or not her fans approved, she'd ask your opinion.  But she didn't.  So leave it alone.  What irks me more is that this Kevin guy is being judged and because of his image, Britney is being treated like some little girl blinded by "love" who can't see that he's nothing but problematic.  Perhaps he is.  Why does it matter to you?  Oh wait, let me guess.  Because you  care  about Britney?  Give me a break.  If you cared about her you'd let her make her own decisions (and yes, even mistakes) free of ridicule.  I still don't see why any teenager thinks that he or she has any ground upon which to tell a grown adult how to lead her life.  It is utterly pathetic that Britney must be judged and criticized for her every move, choice and bad decision when people her age and  older  are out there doing the same damn things (or worse).       Yesterday my dad and I were watching FoxNews.  They showed Britney and Kevin on some beach with the paparazzi swarming around them incessantly in a scene that reminded me much of a group of angry bees attacking some poor defenseless individual.    I would  never  want to be Britney Spears.
