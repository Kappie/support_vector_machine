"How 'bout (that) you put your patch on MY eye!?" "Thats not a wooden leg thats my ....." "Yo Ho Blow the Man Down stairs" "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggghhhh you free Saturday night?" "Is there an 'X' on the seat of your pants? Because it appears that there's wond'rous booty buried underneath!"  Thats when Brigadier General Bud Light came and the party was complete.  What an awesome time.
