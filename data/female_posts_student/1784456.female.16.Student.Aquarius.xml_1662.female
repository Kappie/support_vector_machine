Don't worry, I'll never forget about Rage of the Winter! Or Smashing Blue! *yup, i circulate around freak songs* I swear you could almost see me in the Donnie Darko sound track! Ahh I've been looking at AS/A2 level courses... I said that I couldn't do some and my mum hit me with her ball of wool! It really hurt! Apparantly I'm not allowed to say stuff like that again! *aww, what a loving mum* But she didn't have to hit me so hard!
