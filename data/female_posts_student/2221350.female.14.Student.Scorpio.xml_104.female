It's just another day in paradise."  I always know how to make her laugh.   I suppose I can start with the kitten story. Sunday night((right after I had written the last post)), my mom came home with a kitten and told mammaw she found it near a dumpster behind expo hall. I was ecstatic, but not too much so, as mammaw was not supposed to know that the kitten actually came from some lady's house. So then I had a cat, a little cat, and I made sure it was all happy. By Tuesday I was well on my way to convincing mammaw to let me keep the "stray" kitten.. Or so I thought. Tuesday morning during third hour mom called me and simply said "mammaw reads your blog, she knows about the cat, we're busted, and I'm going out of town." after a few good hours of reeling over the fact that she knew about the cat thing AND that she's been reading this blog for the WHOLE time, I slinked into the house and then proceeded to have a screaming fight with mammaw which ended in me blubbering about the cat and mammaw immediately relenting and letting me keep it. Well what I haven't mentioned yet is that the cat is ugly, loud, annoying, and max((my other cat and the apple of my eye)) hates the little bastard. So we finally decided that we were going to find a god home for the first cat and get me another one that was calmer and that was a girl so max would like it.  HOW DARE mammaw read my blog? Huh?!?!? I asked her nicely to not look for ways to read it and I trusted her good will that she would keep her ass out of my bushiness and let me have that one shred of privacy that I need to keep from going insane. I should have known she was a horrible nosy control freak liar. This is why there is now a password block on here, so I am absolutely positively sure nobody but who I want to look is looking.    Wednesday, after they had a fight, mom decided she was going to dump Steven. This will be the third time she has chosen to free herself of that pansy and the third time she has failed. So all day Wednesday she literally wailed and puked for no reason. By Thursday they were a happy couple again.    Thursday afternoon I came home and found out that they had already given the cat to an old woman who had called about the ad we put in the paper. I was kind of upset that they had given it away before I even told him bye, but I didn't have a chance to worry about that since Steven was picking us up to go mother's day shopping. We ended up getting her books and bubble bath, which is what we have given her for every holiday since I can remember, and which I disagree with since I think she spends enough time in the tub reading anyway. Oh well.  Friday night Emily called me and invited me to the movies to see 13 Going on 30, which I have already seen and hated it the first time. Yet after a few seconds of cajoling I decided to go at which time Emily told me that it started in 15 freaking minutes. So I didn't go because I knew I wouldn't be able to make it in time and that movie was stupid the first go around.   now it's Saturday, the day before mother's day. Presents have been wrapped, plans have been made, and arguments about every detail have ensued. mammaw is pissed about the fact that mom wanted to get her lobster and steak as her gift, arguing that "that was something everyone would enjoy and she wants something just for her" ((that's a direct quote)). Now, is it just me, or is that totally fucked up? My mother was going to prepare a lovely meal for her and the fact that we were going to partake in said meal and share a happy family moment was just a side note. But noooo! I suppose she would like to eat surf and turf while we hide in the corner? Would THAT be JUST for HER? So her and mom have been fighting all morning, and on mother's day weekend no less. Mom went and got her something that would be only here's and then went over to mimi's house to give her a gift. Mimi is my ex-step-grandmother.   I finally solidified the plans for me to go to daddy's all summer. I will stay there and possibly come back for the weekends. During the week I'll get to hang out with daddy and get paid to help mompat((dad's mom)) organize her business. Daddy told me that I saved her ass last year because I fixed the mistakes in her income taxes and then remembered to make two backup disks.   I'm tired of mom and mammaw's fighting. It's every single fucking day and it's always over something stupid. I am sick of being their punching bags((not literally of course)) after they have these arguments. I am sick of always being the one who listens to mammaw bitching and makes mom feel better when she "breaks up" with Steven. I am sick of being the live-in psychologist and the only person who wants this "family" to stay intact. I am sick of being the strong person, the shoulder to cry on, the one who will always cover for you, and the one who never minds doing you favors like bringing you water every night or coming when you call or washing your sheets or doing your homework or taking your chores so you can go to pool parties or letting you smoke in the house or letting you drink in the house or keeping mom and mammaw apart when they argue or mediating or worrying about things that most people my age don't even know exists.   this is why I'm going to live with my dad this summer, because I just can't take it any more, and because I feel so unappreciated. Maybe without me here they can do their own chores and maybe without me here they will just kill each other. They will never work through their problems with me always pacifying them and solving the problems. It's just not my fucking job.  that's my piece and now I've said it.  there is something else that I thought wasn't a big deal but then realized that if I have to put off writing it in my blog then it must be. I've been struggling with putting it in black and white, but I think it's something I ought to do. When we lived in the apartments we had a neighbor that we called Mr. Jean. Mr. Jean was a nice guy, and he was always bringing us little presents. Well mom would let us stay at Mr. Jean's house sometimes so she could run errands and we almost always went to the pool. Every time we were with him he would.. Touch us. He did it all the time and since I was so young I had no idea it was wrong. I can remember him sticking his hands in my bathing suit and watching him do the same to Devon. It never got worse than touching, and I know I'm lucky.  that was hard to type, but I think I will feel better later.   I found out later he was put in jail for doing the same thing to his step-son.  that sick fucker. I hope he rots away getting ass-fucked by all the other inmates.
