I love it when the power goes out because everything goes really still and you get to play with lots of matches. I finally finished getting everything ready for my Dad's accountant and I'm meeting with him on Thursday. Also on Thursday I have to drive up to Jasper AGAIN! I'm so sick of this. They think the problem with the landcruiser was that it was struck by lightning. They think? Well that have no explanation for a 100amp fuse being blown so that's their only answer. Dad wants the dealership to buy it back from us but that's alot of money and they probably won't. Tommorow I have spanish class and I'm spazzing just a little bit because I have all this stuff do on Friday and I don't know how I'm going to get all of it done. Tommorow I am going to get up early and see if I can finish the lab work before class. Oh and I had the best barbeque I've ever had at Greentop on highway 78. I love it when my family decides to cut off all the water in the house while I'm in the shower without informing me. I wish Edwards wasn't Kerry's runningmate.I can't wait until I can start using the pool daily. I've wanted to for a long time, but there are always workmen around it. There are so many dvds that I want to buy, but I'm slowly going broke now that I'm unemployed. Sigh. This weekend I am going to bake so many cookies, woop woop. I think it's really exciting that you can apply to be in the FBI online, I think I'm beginning to lose alot of faith in the government. I might consider. Like for instance, now you don't even have to have a highschool diploma to be accepted into the police academy. That's exactly what we need... more idiots running around with power. I watched the movie Magnolia last night. It made me hate Tom Cruise and love Julianne Moore. I think she's one of my favorite actesses. Her character was just so believable. The movie itself was extremely strange and has such a silly climax. So I still have yet to make up my mind about it. I also think that I want a pet iguana now. I loved the ones in Aruba. Mmmm.
