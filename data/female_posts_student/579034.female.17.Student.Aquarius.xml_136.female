What's really sad is it's one of those accidents that shouldn't have happened. What scares me is that Melanie was supposed to be with them so thank God she wansn't. I dunno what I would do without her. It's just so sad... this is the second boy from Farrell thats died in a car accident in like a 2 month time period. Freshman year it was Luke and Diana from my school and now in Junior year two boys from another school. It's like, kids shouldn't have to deal with this, parents should not have to burry their children.... it's just sad. x0x
