'i dont want the world to see me, coz i dont think that they'd understand'  i cant get these lyricks out of my head! for the last few weeks i wake up...i put this song on...i shower n i sing this :$:$:$.....i got to bed n i listen to it! i think it's now part of my world! a part of me, lyricly trying to understand myself before i attempt to make others understand me! in a way i wish i could get into my brain, so i could try to figure myself out. i think im a bitch. i always manage to hurt the ppl who mean so much to me. i mean i hurt simon, pete and sam all together! go me:|:|:| now ive hurt katie. itry not to think about it coz i hate the thought of people being upset because of me! ive been upset enough to no what its like. normally i try my best to go out my way to make people smile and feel wanted- like the lil things like runnin up n randomly huggin em! its dumb but when someone does it to u, esp. someone who loves you, you feel like your priceless! it makes your heart bounce and makes you feel soo wanted and loved! *EAK!* :$:$:$ well i hope it does.... ive neva actually asked ppl..:S :$:$:$ but thats how i feel!i love being made to feel special and i love even more making other people feel special! especially when they are as special to me as katie and all my close ppl are to me! its my way of expressing that i love them. i dont know what id do if i lost any of them..i dont think i could deal with it! n i keep thinkin what if...what if id neva met kim n ppl, n waht if i hadnt gone to bhasvic! i would b stuck in the tiersome circle at blatch.....pretend to be someone im not to fit in...leak abit of me-age...them notice abit of me and see how they dont like the real me...so i get rejected for being who i am.....endless pain and depressin...lost identity...lost soul trapped in a world of fakeness and unwantedness. all i ever wanted was to fit in! but they never understood that because i wasnt like them! if i was still at blatch i would still be arguing,still be crying, still be hurting. there were endless weeks of getting home from school to lock myself in my room crying in a corner for hours, and other times sitting in tears telling my mum how much i hate my life and how much i want to die more than anything! its not natural for a school girl to wanna kill herself! but thats how much i wanted to be accepted and wanted!  *opps got off the point abit:S i doont even know where that came from, but it came with alot of tears and emotion. i take i didnt let out all my emotions about this stuff so it was still bunged up:S:S *blushes* i seriously dont know where any of this comes from! its like i put my music on really loud through my headsets n jus ttype..i start to type n i jus tcant stop! im not thinkin about any of it! i hav 2 go back and read it jus tto find out what oi put (and to try and correct some of the many mistakes!)  k so where was my point?! oooo! yea if i hadnt gone to bhasvic then i wouldnt hav such good friends- wouldnt hav met my new ppl and wouldnt have got so muchcloser with katie and liana! i couldnt, and wouldnt want to imagine my life without them...because its just a horrible thought!  its actually really strange! i like it at college! i wake up..and instead of eargh school! its yay college! not my lessons of course! (appart from media n photography) but for my free's and jus tbecause i feel so wanted because my friends are so amazing! i no that sounds dumb, but even if we dont tlk that much theres jus tsomthing there that shows how mch we care about eachother, and for once in my life i actually feel like i fit in by being myself! n im gradually getting more confidence- not ashamed to be me, so ill invole myself and get myself noticed more for being me! altho i still find it so hard! some days i get to college and im just like.....omg everyones staring at me...i look such a mess...thats y they're stairing at me...they're judgin me....they all hate me...!!! n of course no one is actually staring at me....coz i mean i me so y shouod they! there are some amazinly gorgeous ppl at college! you see them and jus tfeel completly inadequite! its taking soo much for me to actually get some confidence! most people cant understand me, because theyve never been like me...they dont look and feel like i do so they dont feel as insecure and disgusting as i do! people always say they understand, but they couoldnt possible!its on of those things you can only feel if you've been there! empathising doesnt work! thats y ive hurt myself as muc has i hav, not for the pain, but because i hate how i look (in my fits of phyconess) i always feel inadiquite and worthless! however much effort i put in! theres always everyone else who looks, acts and is better! thats one reason i love having a blog, i feel i can tell al of this and it cant respond! coz if this was one of my friends i was tlkin to then they would be sayin o no thats not tru ure better.....blaahh do blaahh! coz they think its the right thing to say!but really its not! ppl think complements will make things better, buit they just make things more doubtfull!
