We decided we would go to the 311 concert tomorrow night together. And he was like you never told me it was free, I was like ummm listen to the radio. So a few days ago Jesse asked me if I would go. I could go with him, Allen, and Trevor. So i was down with that because I hadn't talked to Brent in a while and just thought that he forgot what with Staci and all, you know. He's a little side tracked. Although the other night he got on for like 5 minutes and was like I just wanted to see how you were doing. That was my aww moment of the day, even though I kinda thought it was bullshit...but whatever you know. He told me that Brewer might go with us....which heh...definetly so NOT a bad thing by any means. I mean daHHamnnnnn boy, you fioyn. The concert should be fun, because dammit if it isn't, I'll fucking make it. And then I'll go find Jesse....heh heh heh..Like I seriously told my mom I was like if she's there, i'm callin him and I was like would you be mad? She goes no, as long as you come home alive.
