You make me feel so good, you make me wanna rock side to side, you make me wanna shake alil harder and torch alil harder. I must admit that it was the most in creditable nite of my life.  I was singing, I was dancing in the shower, I was so happy. Just bought myself a little portable radio and placed it in the shower. Now, every time I hit the shower I get to listen to music too. Music that makes me wanna do so much but I’ll leave that up to imaginations.
