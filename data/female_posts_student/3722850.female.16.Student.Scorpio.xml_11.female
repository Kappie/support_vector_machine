You have more stability than you realize, even if you feel like you are lost in a deep fog. The more closed in the mists are, the more you'll need to rely on your intuition to figure out what's on the outside. Hang out with good friends now, for they can give you the support that you need, in order for you to maintain your direction, no matter how poor the vision is at this time.   LIBRA You already know that you don't have to express every emotion that you feel. But this doesn't mean that you shouldn't feel them. If you bury emotions, you will end up being controlled by your fears instead of by love. Even in the workplace, you'll be pulled between the safety of rational thoughts and the vulnerability of feelings. Logic may create security, but it won't cure loneliness.
