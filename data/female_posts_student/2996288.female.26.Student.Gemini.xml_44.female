The area around here is a bit...sketchy, but the room is okay, and there is High Speed Internet, which is amazingly nice.  Otherwise, I'd only have the television to distract me.  Now I have the interenet, too!  I'm not feeling very clever tonight.  I feel more like if I move my head too quickly, all the information that is precariously balanced in there will start spewing out my ears.  I will be so glad when this is over.  Oh my, oh my.  Soon.
