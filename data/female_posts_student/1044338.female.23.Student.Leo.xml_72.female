I made an appointment for this coming Tuesday at  urlLink Bear's Skin Art  Tattoo  place. I'm going to get a little diamond stud (I want it to be very classy and subtle).  Since Dan already calls me "Fu" (as in shortening my last name - Fung) -he's already decided to nick name me "Fudolph" (as in Rudolph) because my nose will probably be red for a couple days. Hmm...not looking forward to that part. :/  I'll be getting it on the left side, since 99% of the people I've asked told me they see it on the left. 
 
 I'm excited, yet nervous at the same time. The girl that's piercing my nose told me to make sure I eat before I go in, so I don't faint. Yikes!  My parents are freaking out about it because they think I'm mutilating my face. It's definetly the riskiest thing I've done in terms of self-image, but I don't think it's over the top! I don't think I've ever heard of anyone's parents being okay with their child getting any kind of piercing aside from the normal earholes.
