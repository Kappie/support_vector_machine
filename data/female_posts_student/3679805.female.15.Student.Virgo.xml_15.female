But Never say I love you if you dont truely mean it because you'll end up hurting someone in the end.  But why cant friendship be enough?? Why does it need to be something more??  I have asked my self...       why back to him?      why not the one i truely like?      why not find someone new?  And i always come back to the same answer    "b/c i thought i loved him and couldnt live with out him"    WELL LOOK AT ME NOW! im doing fine on my own!!      ~kc
