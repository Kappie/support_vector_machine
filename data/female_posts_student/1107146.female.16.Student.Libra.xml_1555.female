You think he'd learn after the thousandth time or so, "maybe I should decrease that time a lil' bit"? Well, I dunno.  Drunks With Guns. I've only found one song called  Pavement ...it's a musical, and I must add, it's very drunken. As is most of their music. It turns out, Drunks With Guns began in 1984 as a punk band and spent more time making up the names of their songs that actually writing them. The music is incredibly worthless, it's the same throughout the entirety of the songs, so I've now heard, after hearing the very wonderful  Punched In The Head  and  some other songs with pretty offensive names ...just go look for them if you really want to know.   As with any punk band, they broke up from internal dissent and began a legal battle for possession of the name Drunks With Guns. So it is. But they are very drunk, let it be known right now.   True, I'm more of a Coke person. For a while I was a Pepsi person, I dunno what happened. I guess Coke got cheaper and I started buying that again. But Coke is like...the Jack Black of the carbonated beverage world, whereas Pepsi is more the Turning Leaf Chardonnay. Take the caffeine out of it and make it diet, tho, and it becomes Sewage In a Gold-Plated Can, Calorie Free. Gross. And whatever happened to Pepsi One? That stuff was horrible too, but I haven't seen it lately so I wondered...  Eep, I dunno about MSN but I don't like ICQ...I used it for about three days and then I was going to cry and do something dangerous with a sharp object to myself. But what's so evil about them from your standpoint?  Sigh. Days are really slow lately...has anyone noticed?  Something incredibly random: your skin actually cooks if it's thin enough and it touches a sunlight-heated car surface. My knuckle will bear testament, it was really sporadic and incredibly gross. But anyway...no more wasting electricity on the stove, no sir.   Goodnite friends, have a flower-filled, sunshining day.
