(p.s. erin, i wasn't trying to be bitter by saying that.) ok so my day:   math - did a diagnostic test... gay.  art - worked on my final assignment (an essay about a freaky-ass painting) and mr olsen tried to help me with it... except now i have to change everything i already had, cuz all his ideas were different to mine... and obviously, he's right.  lunch - hung out with erin... we caught up. saw tara! she=SO effing pretty. god. bought pizza (even though i had a lunch). t'was alright.  gym - played handball - kindof a long game. and we got time to work on our notes for our in-class culminating thinger...but did i? psht. no.  geography - wow. best class of my LIFE. only cuz erin's in it...and she makes me laugh. but we had an exam review test thing, so that part kindof sucked... and i think i'm ready for my exam. yeah, that's right. ready.  "oh so we do have a test today? aaah i told you, mike! aha stick that in your pipe and  smoke it !"-ray. ahaha it's funny cuz that saying is the older than old cheese. (woot.)  "hello lula!"-me and erin about 37972 times today... in a chinese accent. guess you had to be there.  "hey do you want to be in the 'i heart erin t' club?!"-erin, as she writes 'i heart erin t. heart, heart.' on my hand...wow so random.  "aaah should i go to summer school? i don't know if i should... should i? maybe i will. what do you think, kate? do you think i should? i don't know... will you come with me to hand in my summer school form to the guidance office? but i don't know if i should go..."-sylvia. continues like this for 5 minutes.  "wow. doesn't he look special."-vanessa, after seeing you-know-who (guy on my bus who makes me have seizures when i see him). she probably meant retarded.  "sarcasm is like my life..."-me "ahaha that was sarcasm!"-vanessa "...uh no it wasn't...?"-me "yes it was!"-vanessa "no, i was exaggerating. not being sarcastic."-me "same fucking thing."-vanessa --yeah that really  was  funny...another one of those things that you had to be there for.--  k that's all for now, folks.  these eyes they're strongly covered in disguise- they're waiting on the real time again.  kayte.
