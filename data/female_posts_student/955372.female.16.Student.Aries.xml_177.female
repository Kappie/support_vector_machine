Yeah and speaking of that saddo, he wore a black turtleneck sweatshirt and we're all like "why would you wear that again, you look like such a frigging retard!" poor confused man. OMG our math sub today was amazing, he looked like a bald fat gene wilder. he was hillarious, only not on purpose. He's all "yeah those sun valley kids" and i'm like "your my god" So kelly wanted a picture of me, and i was like "ok but i have to find a good one." So i come home and i try to take a picture of myself thats good. and well that didn't work. So my sister took a picture of me, and that one is good. I sent laurel all my tries. We had a good time laughing at them. good times good times..
