It's the theme color of the wedding of course, that light purple, but a little shade off cause we both agreed that I don't want to match every flower and table piece.  And I even got shoes that I can walk down the eisle without tripping!  They are soooo awesome, and I love them so much I will cry if anything happens to them.  We destroyed like 5 million stores and tried on about 20 thousands pairs of shoes.  Finally, my sister found these ones that were made of ight blue leather and like, with a nice heel that isn't too high and I wont trip, and one the side of my small toes there is this little butterfly thing.  It's so classy, so sexy, and those shoes so say "ME."  Kind of ironic too because the meaning of my name is butterfly.  When I saw them I just said "those are the ones" before I tried em' on, and when I put them on they fit perfectly.  Today I am not really doing anything much.  Relaxing I guess.  I worked hard for exams, and now is my time to relax.  I am also working on my audtion for the play.  I have almost got my monologue down, it's going to be great.  And even f I don't get a part in the play (cross my fingers and work hard and hope I do) then I am sure I wil be busy enough with drama as it is.  Megz and I were talking to the drama teacher and he said that he thinks we might get to do "travelling drama" where we would go to other schools and show them the scene work that we did, or our script work maybe.  I sure hope we get to do that.  Semester 2 is definetly going to be time consuming and hard work.  I think after doing chem though, I feel like I can do anything.  I remember all the times I cried over chem, all the times I wanted to drop Chem.  I was actually reading only posts of mine in my blog and just about everyone second post mentions Chem. lol.  And well I have to go to dentist later, (dentists are evil) but well yeah I haven't been in a year, so at least my teeth will be white instead of yellow.  Something to look forward too.  lol.  I actually really badly want it to be semester 2 right now!  I think I love school a little too much, but yeah I am soooo excited for Bio too, and Drama, Drama, DRAMA!!
