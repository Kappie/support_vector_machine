It's really a good feeling to be loved and to know that you can talk to the peopson you love. I began feeling really hopeless when he was gone, but I really should stop dwelling on that...I'm just happy again. Which rocks but we have to tell our parents soon, no wait! I have to tell our parents soon, oh yeah, can't forget about that, and I am kinda stressing out so that sucks! ha ha...it all just goes in one big circle...
