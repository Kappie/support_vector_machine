The last three days had indeed been an ultimate busy one but come to think of it, it was all worthwhile.    All the events started to unfold on wednesday morning. All the preparations through the past 1 week or so was up to use. It started off with the students' Council investiture. I would like to apologise coz' i was actually the vice ic for the invest. but i'm not sure why i was slowly drifting away from it and ended up only Tuan and Wacky was slogging for all the programmes. There were loads of misunderstandings between HC and SC during this period of time i wld say. There were also loads of last minute tings before the sc investiture but overall it was quite smoothly done though i wld not dare to say that it was an outstanding investiture. I clearly remembered Han Nee helping me to pin on my sc badge and hugged me! My idol!! haha! This symbolises the start of my new sc life. I know that there will be great challenges ahead but i'm sure i gonna be able to face it and bring glory to myself! hehe! Immediately after the sc invest, i rushed over to the AHS visit where i said sumting i vaguely remembered and my teacher actualli commented that my speaking skills improved. I felt greAtt! haha. After that was the Mass dance show for the ahs peepz. haha i dance like mad!! then after that was Temasek IdoLS! haha D7 and F4...u all rocks all the way!! Although u all weren't really professional but it was still worth all our cheering for u all! it definitely liven up my sc lifee! After that was the 200km run. my class had to run 2.4km. At first i felt really sick, the stupid frequent headache..what the heck is happening to my head! 05 and 06 ran together!!! haha and we all cheered and cheered! i really couldn't believe that i actually ran all the 6 rounds without stopping. What a acheivement for me!! haha! Then i went out to have lunch with caroline zirui royston sam yazit and valerie. LUNCH at 4PM! can u imagine how packed the whole day was and it din't end here! i had to run back to support the titans. I had to run over to buy plastic cups and after that the alpha seniors realised they have no ppl to cycle and i had to cycle 7km!! with a bicycle which my legs cannot even touch the pedal when i sit. Was really great trouble but i juz can't complain. During the journey, could see that the titans ppl struggled through with ramblings here and there, but THEY did it! i strained my thighs but again i could juz suffer silently. What was the pain as compared to the toughness the titans ppl are going through...that was what kept me going. After the 7km ran was the log events. I was totally amazed by the toughness of that event man. I wanted to go for titans nxt yr but after seeing what they have to go through, i start to have 2nd tots. It was like if i'm not gd i will let down the whole team but still i muz train up though and hopefully i am able to do it! Our titans did really well! i'm very sorry for not cheering hard enough coz i was really quite sick at that time! But i seriously thought that you all were great and marvellous! 10000 cheers for all of ya! And after that event you might think that my whole day has ended. NO! had late night meeting with izzat aqil and zirui for investiture. It was actually for investiture, but we ended up toking about our com and pouring out our displeasures and encouraging each other. You all were great man! I felt better after toking to you all. We should have more this kinda toking sessions! House Captains all the way! zirui too! haha! After the tok which was like 1+ am i tink, we went back to sch to have our real invest. meeting, our brains were quite dead but we have cum out with things! That finalli marked the end of wednesday and if you think i had a great sleep after that...YOU ARE WRONG! i went back to the dirty student lounge to have my sleep. The whole place was filled with rubbish and i have to slp in the uncomforatble sofa! wad the!! haix it was cold dirty smelly everything u can tink of. But was great with all the councillors around. I slpt with the blazer on, disrespectful to the school huh..=x haha..after a fitful slp, i was woken up at 5+ am. Han Nee could not find her specs and she was really frustrated. I tried to help her to find but was in vain. Seen another side of her man=x haha~ she was quite fierce. Me and Tobias kp telling her to relac. I could sense the anger within her. Finally Dhana helped her to find it! so happy for her..but...i lost my 1 hour of slp=x heez.       A new day...Thursday! i got no feeling that it was the 2nd day. Coz everything juz goes and passes so quikly. Morning assembly saw the end of the 200km run. I din't really watch on coz my head was so pain that i could not cheer. I actually was supposed to help out for sports carnival since i'm in house com. but they could not find ushers for science fair and i decided that i shld actually help. i yawned throughout the whole duty. the minister of edu. was there too` at a point i was chatting with ms lee. felt so bad coz i got super low for her chem test. She's a great teacher arhz! Then the great part of the duty was the buffet! free food! hahahaha! i simpLy love it!!!! food rockS! then immediately after that was temasek idols finals...we went there specialy to support D7! haha..and for other singers, all the other councilors were practically sleeping including me. we din;t reallie cheer very loud for D7 coz i tink all of us are toooo tired! Charles and silver sound were great and undoubtedly, they won! haha! After this, FOOS ball!! My classmates disappeared and i was so damn worried that i kalled and msged gladwin to "scold" them, felt bad for the sms and kall! sorrie gladwin! I felt totalli stressed up then and was really on the verge of breaking down. luckily there were more den enuf ppl fer the game! i played!! was really fun man...enjoyed it! and sumting bad happened. The opponent kicked too hard on my left ankle and it sprained again. At first i tot that it was ok, but after that it was soooo damn painful that i had to forgo that game. Din't care about it until i saw it swelling..haha..den aya helped me to apply the cream and it felt much betta=p then i went back to student lounge to finish the sovenirs. i din't get my house com to help coz i tot they shld help to support titans. i ended up getting "scolded". everyone was saying that i do everiting myself and stuff and i do not know how to dedicate jobs. haix...prolly i sucks arhz! i noe i have over drained myself and i will learn k! thanks dhana, sam,angeline etc etc for helping mi with the sovenirs=p then i went to support the titans, it was log relay and log throw...tiring tough...i wld say. i din't really support much coz i was "preparing" for the invest. rehersal after that. then came the prize presentation. i helped to wave the flag haha..so hard that my hand are so painful now. haha but this is nth compared to the titans.
