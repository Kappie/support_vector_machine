I think it's growing up and maturing, clarifying my own thoughts and philosophies and all that jazz. It's pretty cool. I mean, I'm a fan of happiness.   Well summer, to me is cool air condition, mixes, sleeping, laziness, nice cool early morning weather, late night thunder and lightning storms, no school, movies, books, swimming, sunburns - but aloe, mowing the lawn, being outdoors. Lots of stuff.  I love mixes though. I love making them. Especially for other people. But I don't know anybody to give one to. Until my friend Lauren came along and I made one for her! That was the greatest week of my life. I spent the entire week planning the perfect songs for the mix, then the perfect order the songs would go in. I tested them and made sure they sounded okay together. Taking painstaking measures for little things - like making sure Joy Division and Interpol weren't together, but put AFI and Tiger Army's True Romance next to each other to see if the listener could pick up on Davey Havok's vocals continuing to the Tiger Army song in the background.  I was unsatisfied with the Blondie song, though. I put it right after Minor Threat and I think that sounded weird.  Anyway, I was spending the morning making an AFI mix. So far it's just on my computer, I haven't burned it yet. I was putting the songs in order. But I have just been listening to them on shuffle and it's so great. This is the first real AFI mix I've ever made and it's so great! I go from Cruise Control to The Leaving Song to Death of Seasons.   That reminds me, I, as a big long time AFI fan, am worried about the next approach AFI will take in their music. I admit, I'm not the biggest fan of Sing the Sorrow. I like the older stuff a lot better. I like how Davey's voice is more undeveloped and it's underproduced. That's my favorite type of music, most of my favorite bands are the old ones, with weird recordings - The Misfits, Minor Threat, The Damned.  So I was listening to Death of Seasons today, because I added that on my mix, and I hope they go in a direction to that rather than more like Girl's Not Grey or Silver and Cold. Now, don't get me wrong, they are beautiful, really intelligent songs. You can tell the artist is very talented when you hear it. And that's great and all, if that's what you like. And I do like it, really, it's one of my favorite types of music, it's just not the top favorite. You know? I'd rather hear Very Proud of Ya than Sing the Sorrow. But the thing with AFI, is they are so unpredictable. I'm so anxious to hear their new album. But I know we still have a long long while to go yet.  That's one of the things that made me like AFI so much, and why I have been a fan for so long, it's that they change and evolve. I love that. Someone who hears Answer That and Stay Fashionable after hearing Silver and Cold on MTV every morning...it's like two different bands. That's so great! All the other bands, all their albums have that constant trademark sound or whatever. Linkin Park's new album's songs sound exactly like their first ones. Where's the good in that? It's boring.  I didn't mean for this post to get all long like this about talking about AFI and all that. I was just going to post my AFI mix-playlist. It's so hard deciding on what songs to use! I want to play them all from every CD! He he. Well so I finally got 27 songs, that make up about an hour of music. 27 songs! In an hour! Do you believe it? I can fit 20 more minutes on a CD! I didn't think of that. I might add more songs.  While I was at all this music burning and mixing and playlisting madness, (which I don't usually do, because songs take up a lot of space on one's computer, you know) I downloaded Winamp. I'm so excited. I used to use it all the time but when I got this new computer I never downloaded it because this computer already came with Windows Media Player and Musicmatch and all these media players, it was crazy. So I figured I might as well just use them. Windows Media Player is great, I like how it has info on the band and the album you are listening to and all that.  But I used to love Winamp so much because of it's simplicity and I liked all the different skins you could have.  So I downloaded it today and I have this continued feeling of nostalgia. It's so great. I remember how to work everything. Ha ha. I think the feeling also comes from listening to all this AFI. I haven't listened to them this much in a long long time. It also comes from summer I think. And the end of another school year.  I got off topic again.  Check out this skin I found:  urlLink Click here!!! New window will open  It's SOOO awesome! I like it alot! I tryed downloading this one with Robert Smith but I couldn't figure out how to work it right. Ha. Me stoopid. O____O It was an awesome one though, and I already have a totally awesome wallpaper with Robert Smith on it and it would have matched perfectly! They are both dark and dreary (It's the Cure so yeah ha ha) and in black and white. I got it off of I think www.curiosity.de (I'm all about giving credit where credit is deserved). I'm pretty almost positive. I got it a long time ago.  This is my mix, in no order: 1. A.F.I. - He Who Laughs Last... (1:50) 2. A.F.I. - Keeping Out of Direct Sunlight (0:58) 3. A.F.I. - Half-Empty Bottle (1:39) 4. A.F.I. - Three Reasons (1:33) 5. A.F.I. - A Single Second (2:12) 6. A.F.I. - The Boy Who Destroyed the World (3:05) 7. A.F.I. - Totalimmortal (2:44) 8. A.F.I. - Brownie Bottom Sundae (1:46) 9. A.F.I. - Sacrifice Theory (1:58) 10. A.F.I. - Girl's Not Grey (3:10) 11. A.F.I. - Of Greetings and Goodbyes (3:04) 12. A.F.I. - Cereal Wars (1:16) 13. A.F.I. - Death of Seasons (3:59) 14. A.F.I. - Smile (1:31) 15. A.F.I. - Coin Return (2:33) 16. A.F.I. - This Secret Ninja (2:20) 17. A.F.I. - The New Patron Saints and Angels (2:17) 18. A.F.I. - The Last Kiss (3:02) 19. A.F.I. - Your Name Here (2:27) 20. A.F.I. - Today's Lesson (2:14) 21. A.F.I. - Crop Tub (1:50) 22. A.F.I. - Don't Make Me Ill (2:40) 23. A.F.I. - Consult My Lover (1:35) 24. A.F.I. - Open Your Eyes (1:16) 25. A.F.I. - Cruise Control (1:11) 26. A.F.I. - The Leaving Song (2:44)  I realized only when I was halfway through typing them I didn't really need to keep putting "A.F.I." since I already established the fact that they were all AFI but whatever. As I said, I'm stoopid. So those are more or less my favorite AFI songs from each album. I said more or less. Because it changes of course and others I like but aren't quite as listenable for mixes, if you know what I mean. @______@  Oh oh, also, I said 27 songs, because I did have this one but I took it off.   That is all. Have a nice night whoever sees this!    Music: Sacrifice Theory - AFI
