       
      Been tired and busy, too busy to update.  My thoughts on the Oscar nominations will be forthcoming though.  Never fear.  I'm going to see one of the movies that received a couple of nominations today, so I wanted to hold off on my thoughts until I see it, since my whole analysis may change.  So there.  Otherwise, I'm just sitting here in the library, occasionally doing work and trying not to fall asleep.
