"The Second Summer of the Sisterhood" [wow. that title has alliteration; i have a thing for alliteration lately] anyhoo. after falling into a deep sleep around 3:30, i slept for about the next 10 hours. then, close to 1:00 in the afternoon, during my lovely dream, which by the way was rather interesting, i was awakened with a phone call. leave it to one of my friends to call me during my sleep. oh well. it woke me up. yay. so i woke up. talked on the phone for about an hour, and then my mom went out. so, then i played some video games. SPYRO!!! [year of the dragon] i love spyro. i havent played it in ages, and today i finally beat this boss dude named Buzz [he's this overgrown toad that looks hilarious] and got to go to a new level. it is so cool. i cant wait to play again tomoro night!! after playing video games for like the entier afternoon [from like 2:00-7:00] with of course supper in between that somewhere, i lazily put on some clothes [no i wasnt naked but i put on y'know, CLOTHES CLOTHES] and went to church for praise practice. i have to run the powerpoint tomoro so yeah. now i am home. i wanta play spyro so bad. but since its practically Sabbath, i shall have to wait until tomoro night to play it again. *sighz*. im trying to think of something interesting to write in here. unfortunately for me, my life is anything BUT interesting. i think i MIGHT go take a shower now and possibly braid my hair for tomoro. or wait. no. i think i'll shower in the morning and just put my hair in a pony tail tomoro. im gonna wear pants tomoro. my outfit shall be all black. lately i havent really cared how i look. no makeup is perfectly fine for me. but tomoro i think i'll do the whole all black goth type look. black mascara, [heavy?] black eyeliner, and maybe even some dark lipstick, but i hate lipstick so we'll see on that. yes. tomoro is goth day. oh yes. hmm how shall i do my hair? i have to ponder that one for a while. i think. i'll..... im too lazy to braid it. maybe. we'll see. coz if i braid it i'll have to take a shower tonight, and im way too lazy for that right now. oh well. im writing exactly the type of turmoil-ish thoughts that go on in my mind. when im pondering, i think back and forth just like that what i just wrote and yeah its almost as if im talking to myself. but wait. i do talk to myself. oh well. ok. enough blabbering on and on about stupid stuff. bye!!
