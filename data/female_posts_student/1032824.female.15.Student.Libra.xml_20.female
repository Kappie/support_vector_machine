I wish some things would stay the way it is. unfortunately,  nic  is right. things do change, people do change. but we can't just put the blame on people/objects. that isn't what life is all about. we have to accommodate ourselves to the new requirements from time to time, which I admit, can suck at times. life is all about challenging ourselves. without obstacles, life would be effin' uninteresting wouldn't it?  That is why I believe everything that we are put to go through in life happens for a cause. we just have to sit back, and think calmly of what we ought to learn from it.
