I'm sick of it, in fact, and it burns up my soul, and I'd rather none of you discuss it anymore. It only serves to make me hate, and hate is not an emotion I enjoy feeling. Regardless of what the hate page says.   MORE THOUGHTS ON TEEN COUPLES: It takes two very mature people to make it work. If you can, dandy. If you can't, equally dandy. But I don't give a damn either way. I will not persecute any of you. Love is something I would like myself and I would never, ever discourage anybody else from it. Savvy? I have naught but good will toward all of you.  But PLEASE. Do me a favor.   Stop telling me about it. It hurts.   Some days I really wonder if I'd rather be a stupid innocent hurt person who believes or a happy one who is unhurt. That's all love has really done to me, just caused me to wonder that fact minute after hour after day.  I don't want your pity. I just want you to understand. I don't want you to feel sorry for me. I just want you to know how I feel. I want you to know that I've got all these scars from my past experiences and sometimes it hurts even to see the people I love together and happy because I'm not. I don't call it jealousy; I call it longing. I am SORRY that sometimes I feel that way. I just can't help it. I don't know what to do other than wait.  And I think I've already waited forever.
