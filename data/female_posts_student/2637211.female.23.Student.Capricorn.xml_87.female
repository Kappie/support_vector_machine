Oh wait, a flash of inspiration: we have bacon, eggs and toast. That sounds like dinner to me. I need to eat so I'll stop fucking around and feeling so sorry for myself. It's a bad day when I start with the self-loathing and self-pity, but it's full force today. God, every noise Lisa makes sets me on edge. Clearly I'm in a funk. Maybe I'll think about yelling. Hasn't happened yet, though.
