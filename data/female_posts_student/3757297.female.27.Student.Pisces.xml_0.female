They did not.  I got week 41 and I thought, “well, some people are up to 2 weeks late, so maybe that is why I am still getting them?”  However, when I got the newsletter for week 44, I knew there was a problem.  After a few weeks of messages with titles like “Hello, you are now 50 weeks pregnant.  How do you feel?” I decided to try to “unsubscribe.”  So I clicked on the “unsubscribe” button only to find that they will require my password in order to stop sending me ridiculous emails.  Well it has been approximately 40 weeks since I signed up for this newsletter initially, so not only did I not remember the password, I did not even know my username!  Well of course you need your user name to access your password on the odd chance that in 40 weeks you may have forgotten it.  So I am basically doomed to receive these emails until I die or change my email address, whichever happens first.  Every time I get another email I just want to scream “I am apparently pregnant with an almost 2 year old.  How the fuck do you think I feel?!”
