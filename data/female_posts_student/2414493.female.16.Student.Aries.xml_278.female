I don't remember who's coming today. Or when. That sucks. I hope it's Kaitlin today so I can at least ask her mom what time Wednesday is.  I somehow am missing 12 points on homework in math. I wonder how that happened. Well, I have to get 97 points on the final, or a 70-ish percent to keep the A. I hope it's easy. I'm slumping second semester. Edline ranks me as fifth in math, second in English. But I've stopped caring, so everything's a-ok.  Amherst is paying for 200 minority students to visit for a weekend. I'm applying, though getting test scores together will be a bummer. I'm too tired for that kind of stuff, though free plane tickets, housing, a look at Amherst sounds interesting. I wonder if I'll get it.   I wonder what there is for lunch.  There's four Mexican cleaners at our house. $300 for the day. I think, that's a lot of money, but then again, that's their whole day, so $75 a day. If they worked for 10 hours, that would be minimum wage, but I doubt it. So a little over minimum. I wonder why I even care. My room is cleaner than it was in a long time, though my birthday stuff in the corner has been removed.  Oh, I wonder if I have to call collegeboard about taking writing in place of the math 1. Maybe.  Forgive me, I'm out of it.
