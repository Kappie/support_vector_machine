In the center of this park is the very popular Bever Pool, which I consider to be a blemish on the otherwise beautiful landscape. Damn man-made structures. Anyway, the pool is a relatively small part of the park, yet nearly everyone who visits Bever does so for this pool. To me, this perfectly symbolizes the priorities of today's teenagers. The vast majority of them take their money and go to the pool, buying into all that is normal, popular, and common. They are caught up in conforming to society's standards of the "average teen", focusing on that small, trivial detail of the park and missing the bigger picture. Only a select few are wise enough to see past the moment, see past what is commonly accepted and realize that there are far more important things out there. Only a few see the rest of their lives and what they wish to do with them--the others care mostly about themselves, the people around them, and what they can see with their own eyes and in their near future.  There is a tall, wrought-iron fence surrounding Bever Pool. Are  you  inside the fence?
