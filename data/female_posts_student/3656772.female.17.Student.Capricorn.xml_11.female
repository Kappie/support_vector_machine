It was SO FREAKING COLD in our w.s. room today, and he let me and sam borrow his sweater and fleece in his closet. It was sooo nice! Smauss and I will be making him a cheesecake, just cuz hes so awesome. Sam! You should help!! We need your spring form-pan too.  Sam, Smauss? I have to talk to you guys, we should have a sleep over, I have to talk about Greg. I don't want to, thats why I havent yet, I need it pried out of me....I just can't bring myself to say it at school, I feel like it needs more time than that. OH, and don't worry, I dont like him again.  "Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song..."  I miss herding cattle. I should go become a cowgirl and leave this stupid, depressing life behind. Only thing stopping me is the feeling I can make a difference in this world, and I shouldnt waste my chance. *Rolls her eyes* The one part of me that decides to be an optimist....lol.   N E ways, I'm off to bed. I'm going to sleep for three days straight when school ends, just you watch.
