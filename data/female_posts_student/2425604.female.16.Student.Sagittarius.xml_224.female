We're turning to go home. And the silence from the side of the car, Tells me everything and how we are.  Is there no more trying to make this so right. Theres no more trying tonight.  And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone,  And I wonder if, I'm alone in your head.   I know something is wrong,  I just don't know what to do.  You say it's only me, and, that I'm so perfect for you.  I don't want to try no more,  I don't want to make this right. I just want you to be true to me one time.   And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone,  And I wonder if I'm alone in your head.   Twelve days gone by, since I have saw you last,  I'll give this one more try,  I'll give it all my best, and, I'll ask  What could you be doing that is so much fun? Without me by your side, Without me by your side. And, I will take a step back, and, I'll let you ahead,  And, I will take a step away, and, see if you come back, Because there's no more trying to make this so right,  Theres no more trying, Theres no more trying tonight.   We will never be the same,  We will never be the same,  We will never be the same, We will never be the same,  Until you're done.
