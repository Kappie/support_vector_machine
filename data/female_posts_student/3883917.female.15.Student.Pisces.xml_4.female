I've been doing okay with it, keeping myself occupied with chores, work, redoing my room (and actually moving into a new one), shopping, ect. He's in this huge beach house with his family, some relatives and a few friends of his parents who also have kids. Kids. Sure. They're girls who are 16 and 18 years old. (I knew this is what it would be like before he even left.) He told me I could trust him down there, and that I wouldn't have to worry about him.  Before he left, he gave me his cologne because he said he wouldn't need it where he was going to be. I left my bag at his house that day, so after he left I went to his house to go pick it up...it had a short love letter and a burnt CD with all of our songs on it. He has called me every night so far, and everything seemed pretty okay. He bought me a bunch of stuff, he's always whipping out our picture and telling people about me...whatever. Well, last night, he calls me...of course in an area where there's almost no reception (which I have to say after a while I was beginning to enjoy) telling me how him, his brother and one of the girls sleep in a room together...how they walk on the beach at night together, and how they stay up until 5 in the morning together. The whole however long we were on the phone, he talked about them. It was all about those preppy bitches. Needless to say, I was upset. I just sat there and faked every last "I love you" and "I miss you", while on the verge of tears, and at the same time trying not to freak out on him on the phone. So after we got off, I'd say it was around 10:30, I went online to talk to my friends about it. Since my circle of friends (I must say) is very unique, I got different responses from all of them...irronically (that was sarcastic) contemplating each's personality. Christa was all laid back about it, "Eh, he's having a good time...when he comes back just do something to turn him on and make him happy so he'll forget about them." Sarah was all "GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GO TO GOD FOR HELP GOD GOD GOD" down my throat, Dani goes all spiteful on me "Oh, I get NO credit at all I give you help for all of your guy problems blah blah blah" I wasn't mad at any of them, because well they ARE my friends and like I said their responses are their personalities...the reason why I became friends with them. I finished a conversation with my friend Joey about it (who kept coplaining about being single)...he helped me out a lot. After talking to all four of them, I made a decision not to answer his calls for the next two nights (and after that I'm going to summer camp for a week, so I won't talk to him or see him there either) just to give me time to cool off. That night, I took everything that reminded me of him...the stuffed animals, his sweatshirt, his cologne, I put it all outside my door just so maybe I'd be able to sleep that night. (Which I didn't anyway, but that's besides the point.) I took his necklace off of my neck (he lets me wear it) and dropped it right into the lizards cage. I turned all of our pictures around, took the CD out of my CD player and broke it, I did everything I could. I woke up in a little bit better mood, but still hadn't changed my mind about what I was going to do. As long as I get through today without answering the phone, I'll be okay. Tomorrow I'm gone all day, Tay's sleeping over, and then we're going to church and then to camp from there together. I told my sister Karissa about the whole thing (b/c we're like best friends) and I kinda joked around with it to make us BOTH feel better (she had a hard time with some stuff she was trying...she's also working on letting go of this one guy she's liked for a long time who just moved)...I went into my room to take some pictures down from the walls (I stated before I was moving into a different room) and every one of him I took down...I don't know, it was the strangest thing...I didn't feel anything. I turned on the radio, and ironically in the matter of 3 hours all of our songs on that CD played (between the two stations I listen to.) I keep thinking about it, I just can't get it off my mind. To be completely honest, I don't know if I'm learning from this, or if it's driving me crazy...
