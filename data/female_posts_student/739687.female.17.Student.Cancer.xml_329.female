Maybe it's because guys don't care enough to not like me, or because as girls...we're just like that.  Whatever the reason, it's a pattern I've noticed.  And I hold nothing against anyone who doesn't like me. It's not an issue really, I mean their impression of me is whatever they make of it and that's just that.  Some people, unfortunately, take it too far. Like getting obsessed with hating me. Like getting other people to hate me and threaten me and blah blah blah.  I don't care that people voice their opinions about not liking me. That's life, that's people, hell, I'd do the same thing.  But quite frankly I just don't care enough about disliking people.  If I don't like someone, I don't like them, and that's that. Done and done.  Some people freak me out about it.  It's too bad that some people care grudges too far. The majority of people can make the best of it, but some people have to go and be all psycho. That makes me uncomfortable.  Other news: School is gay. I don't like it...I want to graduate and run far, far away. To New York City. I don't think I was meant for Keller. I don't think I was meant to be around here, to be stuck in a place that's so dull. I don't think I care for high school in general. I don't care for the drama or the rumors or the haters... why can't we live in a world where everyone just doesn't give a fuck?  That would be such a lovely world. :)  I hate the fact that I have this stupid blog. Like I have to be dramatic and thoughtful. I want to just put stupid shit in here. I'm sick of that blah-de-blah love-heartbreak-drama shit.  I am quite a cynic tonight. Mostly because I'm done concerning myself with 90% of high school altogether.  The only 10% I care to associate with are the crazies that don't bitch.  I think I'm doing a good job so far.  Lata crazies.
