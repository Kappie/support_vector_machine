That has never been her, she is always the one hiding in the corner.  Afraid to come out, to show herself, For she fears of being torn apart.  She stands infront of the mirror and says to herself, "If they dont know me, they cant hate me."  I just want to shake her, shake her and say, "If they dont know you, they can't like you."  But i can't, she can't know i can see her, everyday crying, sulking and wishing.  Wishing, that once she could be good enough, Good enough for the other kids her age.  So she could show them who she is,  Show them the "real" her.  But she's too afraid to be original, or to be different,  Or to stand up and tell everyone what she thinks. For she believes if she says something stupid,  Everyone will laugh at her, and she couldn't take that, she couldn't take the pressure.  The pressure of feeling alone, or feeling like everyone is centering her out.  So for now, she will stay, sheltered by the crowd. Because she's the shy one.  She's the one who will just sit and take everything in, And when someone pays attention to her, she jumps.  She gets all nervous, like she can't breath, but she shakes it off, she just shakes it off and says nothing  Because if they dont know her, they cant hate her.
