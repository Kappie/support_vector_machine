Actually I think I got more stuff than last yr... lol :P and the dance was alright, also we kicked SO MUCH ASS YESTERDAY!! i almost had a heart attack that game but we pulled through.w00000t.  I have a blow pop. mmmm. and reeses, and chocolate brownies and mocha ice cream mmmmmmmmmm. Not that I'm being indulgent or anything.  Nope.  My weight fluctuates so much it doesn't matter though. la. Um, so yeah. I bought a hair straightener and dyed it brown, even tho it came out red.  I think i have hair ADHD.  For reeeeeeeeeal.  Cause even though I dyed it like 3 days ago im already like.. umm.. blonde crop! weeeee. WHY AM I SO DUMB?!?! i tried to get my permit but forgot to bring my social security number thinger. grrrr. oh well.  blarrrrr.   i wish i could grow, so i could buy an entirely new wardrobe because right now i have so many clothes i cant buy anything.  i was going to write a deep entry and then decided against it because honestly who cares.  our freshmen are so hot. SO HOT. please someone marry me.  maybe i should actually talk to them. maybe. what am i even saying right now. ill actually say something real later.  except maybe... lets make a list of people who rock really hard recently:  rachel jose andrew... even tho hes a big dork joceline ella VIDYA and erin because she actually has boobs lol and maddie because she gave me food  not that everyone else doesnt rock.    because everyone does.  really really  i wrote a story about a girl named minxie. who the hell is named minxie? i dont know where i got that from... but either way if i have two girls, one is gonna be kiki and the other is gonna be minxie, and the boy will still be something completely normal.  omg maybe ill name him harry. Then I wrote this.  "Art imitates life.  Or so they say (I think.)  But in some cases life imitates art.  And in some cases the art isn't necessarily good, clean, or even remotely pleasing.  You could say that television is a form of art.  For some people, their life's art is more of the basic cable variety.  Take Jerry Springer for example."  That's about all that came out of an hour and a half of hum class, well that and minxie.  and me coming writing really weird metaphors involving dogs, raccoons, and garbage cans.  I can COMPLETELY incapable of writing fiction. what a shame.  and deep breathing. man mrs robbins and her yoga really rock.  rachel miller is insane. :) but she should take me home with her one day cause i feel bad about never seeing her.      im going to stop writing for fear of never shutting up
