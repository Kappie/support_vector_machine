There's no one to talk to on msn or on IRC right now. =/ Don't feel like hanging on the phone tonight cos I feel like goin to the loo every once in a while and it's making me feel dizzy and my whole body feels as if it's made of lead! =P  I hate these moments....now where's my knight in shining armour to rescue me? 
 Lol, I wish it was that easy. =P Unfortunately, we're living in reality..so, yeh, it sucks.  Or am I the only one feelin this way?--Fluffles--
