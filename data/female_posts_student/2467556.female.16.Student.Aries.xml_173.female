Then i went to GIG at Mrs. Ferguson's house with the gang.  friday: hmm....i stayed home and hung out.  i can't remember if i finished my coupling season 3 dvd tonight or the night before....but it was good!  patrick and sally finally admitted they loved each other, steve and susan are having a baby and jane....well....she is kinda alone and so is jeff.  but it was such a great season finalle!  now i just have to wait until season 4 is on dvd!   saturday: me and connor went on our first date (at least i think it was a date?).  we saw "The Village" (greatest movie ever by the way, not scary at all and its not meant to be).  it was fun, we should go out again sometime i think and he agreed.   today: hmmm probably not going to do anything  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
