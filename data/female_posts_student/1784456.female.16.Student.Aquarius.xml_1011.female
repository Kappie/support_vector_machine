Hallelujiah! *however you spell it, leave me alone!* There there, don't strop! *GEEZ! WHICH THERE/THEIR?* Ahh heck. Any way my coursework was a bit ...erm ...individual? different? Yeah, different, but not in a bad way! Aww... depressing music I'm listening to. *sniff sniff* I'll be ok! Wasn't that cool in English? Our teacher Mr Nutbrown is soo cool! He's totally phylisophical! Which is cool cause it gets us all going 'hmm' which is good! In a way... it gives a point to my babblings! When is punishment acceptable? Interesting point huh? Well, not the way I put it! Should we be allowed to hit out children? I don't think so. Doesn't that teach them that the only way to deal with some thing is by voilence or force, and doesn't it not teach them how to reason with people? My parents have never hit us, so my brother's now really good at reasoning and he can get my mum to do almost any thing for him! So it's gotta be good! More pocket money! Yeah! I'll go crawl away... I'm getting excited about nothing again! Well yeah, that's what I do. I'll come annoy you later, don't worry. Oh, I'll learn to spell in a few years though so you're still safe.
