Please tell me then I can clear it all up for you!! Hee hee.  I'm all prepared for maths am now trying to learn all this medicine through time stuff, does anyone really care who invented this that adn the other.  I mean yeah its good that it happened and all but who really cares??? Am listening to Meat Loaf, yay, do you know that I'm pretty sure hes a vegetarian!!! Useless fact there for you!
