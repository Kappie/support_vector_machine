I settled out on the pond ledge with my boom box and my dog and literally just sat there for an hour.  The sun was glinting off the pond's surface and the fish frolicked below.  My dog too seemed entrenched in the moment.  Luck never sits still yet he lay at my feet, ears twitching in synch to the music.  It has been a long time since I have been so wrapped up in a moment of rest, and I didn't realize how I missed it so much.  We all need more beautiful days filled with nothing but beautiful thoughts.
