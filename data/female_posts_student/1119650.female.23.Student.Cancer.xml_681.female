Seriously, I think the news is a cleverly devised way to satiate everyone's need for gossip, while doing it under the guise of being informative and keeping the public abreast of issues.    If you think about the nightly news stories on your local news broadcast there are stories about the current state of our country, about the war we're fighting in Iraq and then there are the tabloid pages.  People who delve professionally into the lives of celebrities digging up dirt.  Does anyone really care about the details surrounding Marc Anthony's divorce and marriage to Jennifer Lopez?  Does anyone really need to know that teen-queen Lindsay Lohan's father got arrested for fighting with his brother or that she *might* be dating Wilmer Valderamma?  Seriously, if this is all you have to care about in your life or you're even remotely interested in this kind of mindless fodder: I'd like to have the ignorance-is-bliss stress free vacation that is your life.    Once they've covered all that we get to the local stories.  Children's parents fighting at local sporting events, people stealing money from a county office, pedophiles in a church, people fighting to keep a Burger King out of their town because it will "attract the wrong kind of people".  We watch this every night and head in to work the next day to stand around the water cooler and gossip about it.  Inevitably someone in your office will have an "inside scoop" on the story from their "husband's dog's mother's postman's chiropractor" who once sat next to the guy accused of having the house on the block that's an eyesore at Gino's Italian restaurant in Bay Ridge and can attest to the fact that he's a nutbar based solely on the conversation he over heard.    They'll put these stories under the guise of human interest, or a problem-solvers type of story, they'll even file it just under general local news.  None of this really makes us more informed individuals who are now more socially aware of our surroundings and the issues that will affect us everyday.  No, its just made it easy for us to tap into the guilty pleasure of voyeurism.  We can get away with having our nose all up in other people's business with out having to get to know them or feel ashamed for being so nosy.    I know there are people out there ready to offer up the argument "Well aren't blogs basically another form of voyeurism?"  Yes, absolutely.  I don't have beef with the blogs though, because they don't sensationalize every single minute and retarded story like the world is going to end because Jane Smith from Putnam County forged checks on the Board of Educations check stock and deposited them in her own account.  I think the media generally has gotten out of hand, we don't get a fair picture of ANYTHING these days and everything is hounded and blown so far out of proportion in such a disgusting way that I don't find the news even remotely credible these days.  I know as a whole we'll never get a completely accurate picture of events from the news, and I know that it is informative somedays when an issue comes up that was unbeknownst to the public previously, but will seriously affect them.    My point is just the media needs to be put in check.  They need to start reporting responsibly and not just jumping the gun to be the first to break a story.  It doesn't matter if you broke it first if you have none of the details correct.  I believe in our right to know what's going on with our country, but at the same time I'm willing to trust the government (at least one person, somewhere in the government) knows what they're doing and I don't need to hear about all the new behind-the-scenes safety measures.  Didn't you ever think they're behind the scenes for a reason?  This tabloid-fueled peeping Tom media frenzy needs to stop and we need to turn back to a time when there were responsible journalists reporting ACCURATELY on issues that matter to everyone, not just filling an hour with stories that let us our noses in someone else's private life.    This has been my Diva-torial...Thank you!  Whoops, wrong  urlLink place
