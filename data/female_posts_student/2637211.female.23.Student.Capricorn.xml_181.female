My dad forwarded me an im discussion the two of them had (he asked if this was alright first, and I agreed), and I am just amazed at how self-righteous and illogical she is. She basically told my parents that they couldn't see her baby if they don't accept James. And my dad is right, he knows it will not be a good scene if they were all in a social situation together. I completely agree with my parents, but I feel so pulled at by Alex to take her side. And when I'm hesitant or uncomfortable with anything, she refuses to acknowledge it. I'm really unhappy about feeling stuck in the middle, and I feel like I've given way more than I've gotten.  Oh well, had a long phone conversation with my dad, and I'm feeling better. Hmm.
