When I finally broke down and went thru a severe depression, I had people around me, saying,   It is all in your head or Only weak people have a burn-outs  ...  Let's face the facts...  First of all.. Burn-Out is a yuppie way of saying Depression... Second of all, weak people don't have depression, they just feel like they do ALL THE TIME.  The ones that are strong are the ones that fall the hardest... Trust me..   Because when you are in it,  you basically tell yourself that YOU ARE OK,  first mistake..  Talk to yourself and listen to our loved ones... They see the side that you try to hide (very badly) and can get you help.  Let yourself be open to suggestions and helping hands.    All this to tell you that,  2 of these people, the ones that couldn't understand about depression, are actually in one and are off work and on meds and are in a bad way.  I wish my friends would  listen to advise and not dismiss it.    At Christmas, our church family lost a great lady to depression and it's very dark side.  She  I use to talk often and I am still, today, so upset that she couldn't find help.  And yes I feel like I could of help.  So on this, listen to your body, stop and breath more often.  Talk to friends, doctors and even to your diary.  If you are not OK, you can't take care of anyone.  OK enough, take care everyone and......... Be Good
