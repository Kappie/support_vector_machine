(Sounds nice huh?) Ahh I'm going to see Akira at IMAX! Yeay! (I sound like a kid again!) Aaargh Kazaa's annoying. Every one gets really good conections with us and we get 0.09kb/s! Damn it! *we're too nice* Not really, I close it so it gets rid of all the uploads and then reopen it! *muhahaa!* Mmm... I really need an After Eight! But they're Nestle! Are there any fake rip of After Eight's out there? *maybe I should put an add in the paper*
