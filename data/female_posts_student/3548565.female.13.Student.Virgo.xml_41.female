The 1st ques was a killer. 5 choices, wif practically no possible gud essay. Well, some ppl mite hav written greeaaaaaaaat essays tho... haha... Neways, I changed my ques in the middle while writing the 1st ques I picked, which was the letter thingy... but I had a feeling that I wrote the addresses in the wrong order, so I changed it to another topic on road accidents.. eugh. Haha.. ya it's a 'karangan fakta' n I hate that kind. But well.. I had not too many choices...so.. yeh, I'll keep my fingers crossed. =)
