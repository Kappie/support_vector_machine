I've had driver's ed starting on tuesday. really boring. one hour lecture and one hour movies, plus driving every other day. I drove today to harvey, and I am sooo happy I didn't screw up terribly. I went a little too far to the side of the road once, but other than that, it's all good.  I got my grades today in the mail. I pulled off all a's and a-'s for everything except science, which I got a B+. I am so relieved since I worked my but off on these tests. I also made honor roll w/ a 3.816 gpa. I still can't believe freshman year is over.  planning a bridal shower is nuts. first of all I really don't even like bridal showers. I get bored since I'm really not interested in what is talked about or what games are played. and know I've gotta plan one! good thing I love my sister so much.  I found an article ripped out of the classifieds in our kitchen. it's for a job offer in ames at cy-ride for my dad.  I wouldn't think much of it except for the fact that since he's worked at cy-ride before, and cause of that I would say he's got a pretty good shot at getting the job. and if he does I know we'll move. my mom is miserable with her job all the time, and my parents love ames. don't get me wrong, I do too, but I really don't know if I wanna move. It's such a change. I'll have to keep thinking about it...
