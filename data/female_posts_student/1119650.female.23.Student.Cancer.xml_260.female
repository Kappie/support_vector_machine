To Tina I leave all my CPK, girlie 80's toys, powerpuff girl  sanrio stuff and my tilt jeans. To Lisa I leave all my shoes and chapsticks, Aidan and sordid secrets for good gossip later. To Lou I leave all my shitty pop music cds...do what them with you will, but I know the temptation to listen will over take you eventually. To Jon I leave my vibrators because as you once said (and I quote) "I can't compare". To Missy I leave my kitties and my martini shaker collection (complete with cool martini glasses). To Anna I leave my detective hats, feather boas and digicam so you can take awesome SG.com pics. To Petrina I leave my top-secret brownie recipe, my simpsons figure collection and my cat, Milo, so you can have Milo  Otis. To Michael I leave 25 million dollars so you can buy your downtrodden soul back from Whitey.  The rest of you can fight amongst yourselves for the piddly crap I have left (and if you find my furby, burn it)
