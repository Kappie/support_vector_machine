I guess i'll just have to let it pass because some of the stuff that she said to me really hurt. I mean she doesn't know what it is like to lose a mother....I mean....she thinks it is so easy to get over something like that and it's not. She keeps telling me that it's been long enuf that i need to get over it...and i think she just needs to shut up because she has no idea what it's like...i don't care what she says. I dunno...I miss Sam..i wish he were here for me to talk to. I got to talk to Brandon today...i think he's gonna break up with me..he was telling me that he thinks that it would be better if he weren't in my life right now...not untill i "get better" because of the consequenses on his side...but he has helped me he was the one who got me out of "my shell" in the first place i owe that to him even tho he may not even kno. I just don't know right now. I'm just so confused!!!!
