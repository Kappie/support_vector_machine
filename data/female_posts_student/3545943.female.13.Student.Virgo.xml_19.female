But then when you look at it, most of our governing leaders are bad.  Then there's the question of whether or not they are really bad or if it is just our perception.  Does an effective leader remain in the public's favor no matter what, or does s/he do what is the best choice for the public, even if it means falling out of favor?  It seems as if the choice of one who is pure in heart would be the latter, but if you are in the public's disfavor, they will do what they can to stop you.  By choosing the "right thing," you may inspire a revolt, throwing the country into political turmoil.  And then have you done what's best?  A people is only at peace if it believes its leader is doing a good job, so if you go against public opinion, might you be taking away the peace?  It seems as if our problem is based in that the only people that would run for government office are those not intelligent enough to realise how difficult it would be to make such decisions.  Only those that don't think through all the options are willing to make such decisions.  And then there's people like Bush, who neither make good choices nor remain in the public's favor.  Or does he?
