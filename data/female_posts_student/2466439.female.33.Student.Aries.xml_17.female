I had been using it for personal stuff, but lately I've been reminding myself about the hot issues that are important to me and asking my (future) self how they turned out.  I think  urlLink futureme.org is pretty nifty. I've already gotten emails from my past self. It's also fascinating to see what other folks write themselves about. People write a lot about relationships, wondering how they're going to turn out.
