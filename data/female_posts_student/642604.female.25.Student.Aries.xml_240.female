And I managed to cut the vegitables without a cutting board and a decent knife (all of this was before I looked over and remembered that I had the chopper which I completely forgot about).  Since, aparently, we only have one frying pan and one spatula (sp?) I managed to fry an egg with butter on one side of the pan while making grilled onions and peppers on the other side with a little oil.  Then I was able to get all the water out of the pot without a lid or a strainer AND finally was able to mix it all up in the pan without the rice searing itself to the pan itself.  I feel so proud... and a little sad... I miss my good knives, my multiple pots and pans, my cutting boards.....
