Six long hours later, and she took me to the airport. She cried when I left her at the security gate and I proceeded to fly on my own. How extremely exhilarating. I felt as might Cami Agan, when she travels to France in the summer all independent with cultural class . . . except I was headed for Ohio and it wasn't going to be a lazy retreat from agenda. And those droll agendas were 1) secure a place to lay my blonde mid-country head for the next 10 or so months and 2) to find some creative way to pay for that place. Poor Jonathan was fated to endure the stress and type A personality of the LaChelle.  As in all solo ventures, I met an interesting and slightly off person: Steve the scientologist. Need I say more? Well, after a plane delay in a somewhat empty airport in St. Louis, I finally made it to Dayton. JP and I stayed up for a little while to talk, but then I felt so sleepy and I had a tour scheduled for the next day, so I unpacked halfway and went to bed. The next day, we did the whole tour thing led by a sophomore in college and then called Mae to ask if we could swing by to see my sweet new graduate pad, my livin' large lounge, my own tiki bar getaway of self-sufficiency.  Yeah. Well after parking and walking across some undefined foliage, dry and the shade of last century's ugly, we were greeted by a five-foot happy Asian woman with rotten teeth and her tall, silver-haired white husband. (I notice teethers since I got braces.) We went inside and I wondered if anyone was actually living there. Boxes with dirty laundry spilling over, dinosaur-matted carpet, and a crevice, er kitchen, that bred rust and broken tiles revealing the black beneath. I think they were using my room as a living room, and was there even a door attached? Before I could be warned, I almost stumbled into the second floor bathroom, but stepped back when the odor of urine hit my nostrils. I was in a hurry to get out, so after thoroughly jamming my head up against the low, attic stairway ceiling and then back down the stairs, we smiled politely and ran. So that was a $100 deposit down the fallopian tube.  With an emerging headache and massive glowage (aka girl sweat), I suggested we end the day and start again tomorrow. Jonathan had some business to take care of at his church anyway and then a viewing to go to, so I washed my face and changed into lighter clothes and sat around the apartment. I called Delisa and then Josh and then I took my Bible and wandered outside to the patio. There was a friendly little wasp tinkering through the green hedges and I turned to Matthew chapter 8 for us both. I've decided to read the NT straight through again. I hate skipping around. The sky turned to a more mellow northeastern indigo and JP and I decided to go grocery shopping for Mediterranean salad ingredients. It was probably around nine or ten when we got back. I selected his Monty Python dvd to watch since I (and I say this now with shame) had never witnessed its glory in full form. I think some girl in an honors class had shown a clip of it for her paper presentation my freshman year, so the "is she a witch" scene was all I had seen. We rinsed Romaine lettuce and spinach leaves with water, chopped up carrots, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, and green peppers, tossed in Greek red olives, basil, feta cheese, and blue cheese, and then dressed it in Emril's house vinaigrette. Thank you Emril for the happiness.  Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday. I convinced JP to drop me off at the campus early Wednesday morning and wandered around McMicken Hall to see what professorly specimen might still be around Ohio instead of Europe for some unearthly reason. Russell Durst was there - he had been on the awards and acceptance committee - and talked to me about his upcoming sabbatical to Spain for the year. Oh God, please let that be me one day. Sabbatical. That word thrills me with shocking lemon sorts of thrills. Then I saw Nancy Bauman and John Alexander and Leeland Person. I met Professor Kamholtz. I love them all. I want to be them all. Then I hurriedly gulped a Wendy's chicken sandwich from the University Center and maneuvered to the corner of Martin Luther King Dr. and Clifton where Ellen was to pick me up in her silver SUV.  I didn't have to stand in the waxing sunlight for long before I glanced over at woman waving at me through her windshield. I click-clicked in my strappy black high-heels down the sidewalk and into her car. Ellen is this woman I met as a result of a registrar mistake. A couple of months earlier, when I got my scholarship letter in the mail, with it was a scholarship letter that was meant for a Brendan Snyder. Well, I sent that letter to Brendan and got a letter back from his mom. Brendan is about 30 years old and in some country I can't think of right now for the Peace Corp. Portugal, maybe? Ellen has a voice that makes me think of a bicycle ambling across railroad tracks. I think she must have smoked about five cigarettes during the day we spent together. She is cracker thin and leathery and wonderful. We serpentined through neighborhoods and she told me to use her cell phone to call numbers on the For Rent signs staked greedily into patches of yard. We chatted nonstop about everything from her scary smart sons to my lack of an Oklahoma accent to her regret that she never had a daughter and would end up in a nursing home with no one to watch out for her. She lived by the river in some multiplex hotel made of blue glass and we drove by and waved back at her fat, tan second (or third?) husband whom she said was hilariously vain. Then, while we were waiting for Jonathan to drive back and pick me up, we ate at Graders, this cute ice cream shop and talked more. Oh, then we window shopped for awhile too. There were two places that I thought I could live at. One was this gorgeous Anne of Green Gables mansion/cottage with a dozen rooms and a couple of living rooms, kitchens, and a perfect little breakfast nook with swinging windows. The landlady lives on the first floor and reminds me of a young Glen Close with soft, wavy chestnut hair. She doesn't wear makeup and her skin is sun-kissed tan. Manhattan accent, political, and a feminist, (I think). The other place was cheaper and very tall and there was a laid-back and considerate guy named Paul who kept a vegetable garden of Oriental herbs and onions in the back who showed us around.  On Thursday (I'll be pretty impressed if you are still reading, which is good if you have stopped because I have recorded shockingly scandalous events up ahead . . . just kidding . . . or am I?), JP and I slept in (at least I did) and ate leftover salad and Cajun-spiced fettuccini for a late afternoon breakfast. I think it was four o'clock by the time I got around to taking a shower and getting dressed. We went to a few thrift stores. At the first one, JP found a wok and a steamer in pretty good condition. I found another awesome lime green sleeveless top, a lacy yellow top from the Wet Seal, and then this soft purple and lavender striped long-sleeved shirt. Then we went to the giant St. Francis Thrift Store and spent a lot of time in there. I LOVE Catholics and nuns and saints. The first gigantic floor had lots of clothes and downstairs to the basement was old gym equipment, dress patterns, Christmas decorations, outdated hymnals, books on etiquette. We didn't buy anything at that one and the second store we went to was already closed. By then, the sunlight was fading and we drove by JP's old house, which was in a nice neighborhood.  After that, we decided to go to the Metro Arboretum. Vegetable gardens of cabbage and squash, rose bushes, specks of would-be azaleas, butterfly shaped gates, trickling streams and stepping stones, lilacs thistles and daffodils, long paths of crab apple trees and a bird blind with croaking bull frogs and ducks. The bird blind was a three-walled wooden hut that jutted out over a swamp at the end of a curvy wooden deck and haloed by cattails. The hut had a border of nothing cut into it through which it was easy to hang my head and chest out of to peer down at the many large bullfrogs. There must have been fifty of them still as death, immovable with marble slime eyes. We left from there to drive downtown, taking pizza from Uno's to the river. We set a navy blanket on the pristine concrete path that ran along the river and ate while we talked and watched the stars and glowing light towers of tangerine and aquas wave and glower (so what if that is a made-up word) in the water. At last, we left for home when the lights went out along the river. But we ended up taking quizzes on Tickle.com (used to be Emode.com) until late anyway.  Friday, my last real day in Ohio, JP and I went up to campus one last time so I could meet with William Zipfel to ask about a position in the Writing Center at 11:00 and with James Cummins in the Elliston Poetry Reading Room at 2:00 in the library. We also went to see the rooms for rent on Howell and the place on Cornell so that I could take pictures. For dinner, we went to a pretty good Mexican restaurant with JP's friend who totally rocks named Brent (he works at the church with JP). After that, we went to the drive-in until 3 am to see Spiderman 2 and The Anchorman (the movie with Will Farrell) and then Spiderman 2 again while listening to the soundtrack to the other movie that was playing on the screen behind us - I Robot or something like that. The sky was dark and cool and we sat in the back of his car with the hatch up. The rain greeted us in clear sprinkles and splots throughout the night. I have always wanted to be at a drive-in during the rain.  Then I went home. Sadness. But good for you, because this journal entry is close to ending. I bet the only person still reading is Jonathan, just to make sure I didn't tell all his secrets. Wait, I don't have any of his secrets. Crap. Man, JP tell me some secrets so that one day I may use them to my advantage. I didn't say that correctly. Oh, poo. Auvrey, tell me your secrets. Someone . . .  I'm getting off track.  Where am I now, after going on such a marvelous trip and seeing the campus? I don't know. I really want this to happen, but (to state the obvious) unless I find a job that will pay me enough to pay for rent, etc. and not have to work full time so I can go full time with graduate classes, then I guess I just can't afford it. Bonny, how are you doing it? How are you working enough to pay for living in a new state and still going to school? I need guidance. All I do anymore is not talk to my parents, go to church and cry uncontrollably, and think about how to make this happen. AND Josh probably can't drive me to Ohio anymore because he is getting a new job and can't really starve himself and forgo all income just because I need a driving partner. Josh, by the way, why don't you update once in awhile, you dork? Just kidding, you are fab.  I need to shave my legs now and think about stuff. Maybe I'll sit in the bathtub for awhile and think about my life in the glory of warm water.
