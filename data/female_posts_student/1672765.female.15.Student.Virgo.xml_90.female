I asked Amanda when I found out, last Thursday, if she could meet up with me there. So I let my damn hopes get up and thought it would be alright.  But she says today she has to do like something or other, 3 things, I was too disappointed to really comprehend anything for a minute She said she was sorry. "i just don't know what i'm going to do..." She said to go and have fun and inserted a grin face. "hi...have we met...i'm no good around other people...i have a low selfesteem..." something else, don't remember exactly She asked was there going to be no one else I knew there. I said that was right. Me: "it's okay" Me: "it'll be okay" Her: r u sure? Me: "itll be alright" Her: good :)   It's not going to be alright, I didn't mean it when I said it, but she always takes that as an answer and doesn't press it.  That makes me feel bad.  I'm tired of her always being so busy all the time. I don't understand how someone could be so busy and have so much going on. It makes me sick and sad and disappointed.
