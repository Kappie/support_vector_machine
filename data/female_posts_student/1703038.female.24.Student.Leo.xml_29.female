Seriously, two weeks of bitchy kids and bad, bad instrument playing, and it ended up being like $3.33 an hour. Still, well worth as far as hanging out with some pretty cool people plus we got some kickass cafeteria food.  I almost creamed my pants on Pasta Showcase night.  Plus a kid insisted I made the best snacktime Kool-Aid ever.  It washed down the generic peanut butter crackers just right.  I can't believe I haven't posted in so very long.  I just get lazy and try to pretend I don't have a blog. I also completely missed out on the whole Laynewatch thing because of band camp, but I guess it was better that way.  I got all the info. without wasting my own time on Google.  I still type in plainlayne.dreamhost.com out of habit every time I get on the computer.  No offense, Quiplash, but it's still kinda disappointing to see your page instead of her stuff.  Real or not, I dug the writing.  I hope that corner of the blogosphere stays alive, but for its own sake and not Layne's.  I had a problem pandering to Layne's style of writing since she was one of my four readers, and I used to give up out of frustration.  There was no way I could turn a phrase like her, and my life certainly isn't as interesting.  NO ONE can make teaching music lessons or being a TA for the Badger interesting, not even Layne.  Anyway, maybe her absence will be a good thing for the little people in the blogging world.  Maybe not.  Either way, I'll miss the drama and I'll definitely miss reading about the girl in the mirror.
