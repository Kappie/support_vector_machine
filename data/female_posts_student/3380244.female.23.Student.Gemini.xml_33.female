Mmmmmm! on my walk back to the car, i passed a house with a sign out front, "the dutch market." this was very appealing, because i have been to germany, and several scandinavian countries and i truly miss the food, smells, people, and chocolate! i stepped in and it felt like i was back in a small pastry shop in sweden... i bought some chocolate (and ate that, right after i finished my truffle) and picked up a menu. i want to go back someday for afternoon tea or a pannekoeken... anyone interested in dining with me?   when i returned home, i ate an extra large salad... felt i had to after all that chocolate! :) so tonight is the 2nd east end festival, i hope it goes well. i remember the one last month was less than pleasing for me, i went with ben and we ended up running into a group of girls that oogle over him. they gave me mean looks and were rude to me, and i remember in my drunken stooper trying to run away from ben and take a taxi home. basically, i was being a stupid drunk girl, and ben was being stupid horny boy.... we're not a good combination when we're like that. this evening i'm attending the east end festival with ben and tony (his best friend from high school that's back in town- yay!). i think it will be fun, because the 3 of us are a lot of fun together... but i have those stupid memories from last month that won't go away.   in closing i will say this... rochester, i heart you!
