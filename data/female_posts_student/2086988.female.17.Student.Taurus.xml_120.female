United seems to be the cheapest, $330-$292 (which after taxes and fees it comes out to $326.38) so whats like $4 dollars? Or I could fly to Omaha which is a little cheaper, but I don't know, have to ask the rents. They seem ok with me going by myself I think, I just don't know about the whole where I would stay part. But I'm definetly coming June 30th and staying until July 7th or 8th.   I talk to you but its not the same as touchin' you And every time you whisper my name, I wanna run to you We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long But it feels like forever, and its hard to be strong  Baby 'cause I'm missing you now And its drivin' me crazy How I'm needin' you baby I'm missing you now Can't wait till I'm alone with you To show you how I'm missing you now  Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do Got my arms around my pillow at night, they should be holdin' you Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I know I can't take this much longer, its so hard on my soul  Baby I just can't wait, till I see your face Chase away this loneliness inside When you're close to my heart, right here in my arms Then and only then, will I be satisfied I'm missing you now We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long But it feels like forever, and its hard to be strong
