I realized that I was going to feel a bit sad that I wouldn't see them everyday for 2-1/2 months, but I didn't think that it would affect me like this.  I can't sleep.  Everytime I shut my eyes, I have dreams about them... Even though I tried my hardest not to have favorites... I do.  I love them all in some way or another, honestly.  Even the ones that CONSTANTLY test me, and see how much they can get away with.  Some of the girls in the 4th/5th grade group have told me that they are going to cry when they leave.  Oh man... I don't know if I'll be able to hold it together if I have little ones that start to cry on my shoulder.  :-\  At least they'll have pictures of me to capture the memories.  They've been taking pictures with me for the past 2 weeks.  I've already had to say goodbye to a few of the kids that won't be there today... but I don't think any of this will hit me until I'm there, and I see all these kids and say to myself, "I won't see them everyday anymore... not until mid-August."      Must keep going...   I can't allow myself to totally fall apart... I have a fair amount of cleaning to do on Friday morning.  Rob (my brother) and Kathy (my sister in law) are coming in town from Houston on Friday night for the weekend.  I wish they were staying til Monday, but they decided they will leave Sunday to try and beat the Memorial Day Rush getting back to Houston.  So, I was actually thinking they were going to wanna go to  urlLink Schlitterbahn  on Saturday... and I was going to laugh in their face about it (being Memorial Day weekend and the first that ALL 3 parks were open)... but my brother said they wanted us all to go over to the  urlLink San Antonio Zoo .  It's not a really awesome zoo, but not all cities have one, and at least we have something.  And apparently the SA Zoo is one of the largest in the country.  Go figure.  I personally would rather go to  urlLink Seaworld , but I know it'd be crazy this weekend.  The zoo will probably be crazy this weekend, even.  And what's so bad about the zoo?  Not much... if you like birds.  I don't.  I'm scared of them... I don't like them looking at me, and I KNOW they can sense my fear.  So, I know that it's inevitable that my brother will FORCE me to walk through the birdcage areas with them, even though I really don't want to, and I'll end up feeling like I've gotten off a really curvy rollercoaster afterwards.  :-\  What can you do?  At any rate, I am really looking forward to seeing my bro and sis-in-law for the weekend.  And luckily, I'll get to see them again on 25 June!  We're going to Port Aransas for a week, and they're coming for the weekend.  They can't take any time off of work to stay the whole time, because they need the money.  They are fairly certain that their house in Spring, TX will be ready sooner than they thought...probably in July (as opposed to mid-late August!). Okay... that's all for now.  I'm going to attempt to fall asleep again for awhile w/o dreaming about crying kids. :'(
