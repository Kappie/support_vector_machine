Rub it in his face. You're to good for him. You were going to leave him anyways, he just beat you to the punch. Who cares if she's witty. You have a sarcastic charm to you. No, you're down right hysterical. Far funnier than she is. Yes, far funnier. And, not to mention, your ass if a good 2 inches higher than her's. Granted her teeth are whiter, you atleast don't have a nasal drone to your voice. ... Except that what you here in your head is different from what other people hear. No, you have a lovely voice. Suits you perfectly. ...Not nasal at all. And you can write poetry. I bet she couldn't write poetry to save her life. Now, now, let's not judge the book by the cover, everyone has the potential to write amazing poetry, they just need the proper muse. But back to the subject on hand. You have much better taste in music. Although, you do listen to many of the same bands... You can make some mighty fine cuisine, but in all fairness, you've never tasted her cooking. ...And you can't dance to save your life, let alone sing...  But on the upside, you do have this hot date. Even though his teeth are a little crooked, and he is wearing an absurd amount of calogne. Just take him for a walk outside. ...Air him out a little. And I'm sure you can find some way to keep his mouth covered. ...But if you're making out with Hunky over here, how can you keep an eye on your Ex? You must make sure his hands are at an appropriate hight when he's dancing with Sluty McSlutson. ...So when you're trying to cover up Stinky's bad teeth, Mr. I-Think-We-Should-See-Other-People and Miss White Trash Van Isle will be doing Gawd knows what on the dance floor. That's it.  I'm staying home. I need a pint of icecream to drown my sorrows. ...But, my ass is still nicer.
