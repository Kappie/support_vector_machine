More presentations, more lectures, and then Mr. Eldred had his back to me when he came to talk, and Trupe was like cracking up at the faces I made at him.  Turns out we can do any art that we want, so long as it doesn't offend people.  Oh, great, when has art, well good art anyways, never offended somebody?  Anand, Steph and I have some definite brainstorming to do...  Went to US History for the second final, which I ended up doing better on.  Then I read Heather's author project for the rest of class, but I've still got many pages to go.  Nick and I went to O'Brien's for lunch, which was good, and then we went to class.  They didn't announce editors today, I guess they had to have another meeting first.  We'll see what happens Thursday, eh?  Afterward, Steph and I rushed to Jamba/car gas, then Tierrasanta for yet another session of Junior Journalists.  It was fun; the kids are really great...but I don't know if they're gonna do any of their homework.  There's this one girl, Carmen, a sixth grader, and she seems like she knows what she's doing.  She's got a really witty sense of humor and there's a definite passion there.  Steph and I pulled her aside afterward and told her that we recognized that she probably knew most of what we were teaching and that we were going to give her special assignments so she could have more fun.  That made her happy, and at least we'll have a few articles from her to have published in their self-titled "Firenerds" publication (haha, they liked the idea of Falconerds...go figure).  Came home and studied lightly for calc.  Steph and I talked about all the concepts on the phone, and I think that's most helpful.  I think I may just understand this calculus thing.  I'm so beaching during 6th.  Give me a call if you want to come with us!
