So when I returned with all my Advanced Algebra homework done I came to find Mr. Kellman's absence. I walked into the room. Michelle violently jolts her hand into a pointing motion for me to leave. Mouthing the words, "GO GO GO!!!" So I press the rewind button and walk backwards out of the room. Laura gives me an evil look. I want to give her the finger because I painted the rest of the brown on the art pillar. We went shopping after talking with Michelle's now psychotic unemployed dad. Value World is fun! Got a Hard Rock t-shirt from Niagara Falls. She got a pair of Old Navy pants to which the tag and stickers were still attached. Went back to class...   I'm heading up to Flint tomorrow. I don't care if I'm a party girl or not anymore. I'm going to enjoy shit to the fullest. I'll figure everything else out in the morning. I've got daisies to make me happy. Daisies everywhere. And no, I'm not stoned.  I'm ready for tomorrow's day of school... C'mon bitch. I'm taking that shit head on.
