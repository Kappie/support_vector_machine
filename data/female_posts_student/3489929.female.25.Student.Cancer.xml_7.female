Posh will kill me... I promised to start so we can help each other. But, considering the fact that the girl is only looking to lose ten pounds- that she really can't afford to lose- I'm not feeling too inclined to encourage her weight loss anyway.  I keep telling myself that when I get my Gazelle, I will actually stick with it and use it every day. I've been lusting after one for a year, so this is a realistic thought. However, knowing myself, I know that I will probably be gung-ho for a month and then store it under my bed, never to be seen again. C'est la vie. That's me.  I want to watch X-2 tonight; I saw it when it came out in theaters, but due to my squirrel-sized bladder, I missed a couple of parts of the movie. Same with Harry Potter three weeks ago. I need to go see it again because of my God-forsaken, useless Kegel muscles. My Ben-Wa balls will go to waste, of this I am certain. Anyway... I am waiting for Lisa to make up her mind as to when she wants to start the movie. She said earlier that she didn't want to watch  Finding Nemo , and lo and behold, she showed up 15 minutes after I had started the movie and watched the whole thing. Weirdo.  LMAO... she just came in here waving a pencil with a penis (or "payness," as she pronounced it) eraser and yelled, "It's a glow-in-the-dark tallywacker!"  Between her glow-in-the-dark eraser and my Day-glo condom finger puppets, we could have a really kinky adult puppet show going on up in here.
