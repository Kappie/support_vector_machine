DAIRY CHALLENGE: drinking a large choco milk  and eating a sunday. the firts one to finish wins.  so we started and my moms wiggin out cause 'we're at a resturant'. it was the funniest thing cause we're trying to make each other laugh so the other one would choke and have to stop temporarily. eventually i won.  so heres some nice metal for ya- Here I Go Again  Artist: Whitesnake   don't know where I'm goin but I sure know where I've been hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday. An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time but here I go again, here I go again.  Tho' I keep searching for an answer I never seem to find what I'm looking for. Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on 'cos I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams.  Here I go again on my own goin' down the only road I've ever known. Like a drifter I was born to walk alone. An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time.  Just another heart in need of rescue waiting on love's sweet charity an' I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days 'cos I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams.  Here I go again on my own goin' down the only road I've ever known. Like a hobo I was born to walk alone. An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time but here I go again, here I go again, here I go again, here I go.  An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time.  Here I go again on my own goin' down the only road I've ever known. Like a drifter I was born to walk alone 'cos I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams.  Here I go again on my own goin' down the only road I've ever known. Like a drifter I was born to walk alone. An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time but here I go again, here I go again, here I go again, here I go, here I go again.  so later days             MEH
