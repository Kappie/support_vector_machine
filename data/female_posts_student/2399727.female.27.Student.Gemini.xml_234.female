The black spot is still there, of course, the flashing is still there in certain lighting conditions, but I read a lot today and don't have any intraocular pain. I hope it stays that way. I'm cautiously optimistic.  It's been a productive day. I was awake at 5:55am to sign up for my courses on the university's system. It wasn't slow at all, which surprised me to no end; when I signed up for my summer course I was competing with hundreds of others and I expected that to be the case today also. To my surprise, though, it wasn't slow even though all of the first year undergrads were eligible to begin course selection at 6:00am along with me.  Ah, they will learn that the early bird gets the worm (or, in this case, the course) soon enough.  I was the first person in the Faculty to sign up and got all of my desired sections so I'm chuffed about that. The only surprise was that they changed the time of the choir from 4-5pm to 12-1pm Tuesdays. That totally screws up my participation in Out of the Cold in both semesters. I'll have to make sure that's not an error before I drop out of that commitment.  By 6:10am I registered and had a choice -- plough on with the day or go back to bed. I opted for the former. I answered various lengthy emails that had come in during the night, I took care of some banking, I went to the grocery store and picked up this week's necessities, I showered, cleaned the kitchen and living room, prepared some baked chicken for dinner, sorted the recycling bin and by 9:00am, I was working on my Psychology review for the final exam. At 11:30, I headed over to Mass hoping Fr. D. would be the celebrant. No such luck two weeks in a row. He's either on holidays or shifted his Mass schedule. I returned by 1:00pm, went to CALSS, learned that I have a seriously damaged modus operandi in most of relationships in my life and bought a couple of new notepads for all of this revision I'm doing over the next 14 days.  Upon returning home I popped my chicken in the oven and did a little more Psych review. I also created an elaborate schedule detailing what I need to do each day to keep on schedule for studying. It's not easy relearning 751 pages of material.  Speaking of Psych, the third term test marks were posted on Sunday. The class mean was up four percent to 71%.   I scored 96% with my multiple choice grade (98%) and my short answer grade (90%) combined. The shocker was the highest mark on the test ... 96%. Yes, I actually got the highest mark in the class on this test! I was shocked, stunned and in total disbelief. I must have checked it three times over the next two days to make sure I wasn't dreaming. Apparently I know my social psychology very well :-) ... I keep reciting facts and figures in normal conversation (much to the annoyance of others, I'm sure) so it's clear that I understand this stuff.  This week is fairly quiet. I will probably go to Mass again tomorrow provided it isn't pissing rain; I also have to complete the revision of two more chapters of notes (as a minimum; I'd like to get ahead so I might be able to take a day off somewhere down the line in this schedule.) M. and I are having our last lunch together on Thursday. I have extremely mixed emotions; while I'm obviously looking forward to seeing her, I'm also dreading saying goodbye.  Although she assures me it is not 'goodbye' but 'see you later', I don't like saying either one of them.  To be frank, I'm not convinced that she'll return to Canada in a year as she says. After all, Canada comes with separation from family, friends, loss of a job and renewed culture shock.  So, we'll see how that goes but I am not looking forward to it for the most part.   I am free on Friday and Saturday except for a load of laundry, and then Sunday is Cottage-D. day. I'm looking forward to seeing him but mostly I feel only trepidation about the reunion. I don't like expensive restaurants for one. I always feel out of my league. I'm also unsure, maybe unconvinced, that C-D's intentions are merely friendly. In Hamlet (III, ii, 239) Queen Gertrude says to Hamlet, "The lady doth protest too much, methinks." In this case, methinks  he  doth protest too much. He keeps extolling friendly love and he has said more than once that he has turned down the romantic love offered to him by two older women whom he considered platonic friends. He has also said at least twice that relationships with a significant age gap are very difficult to navigate because of the different goals of each of the parties. Perhaps he is trying to convince himself.  Onwards.  More to come...
