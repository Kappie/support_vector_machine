I remember this kid named Caleb from one of my classes in 6th grade. I always thought he was cute, but nothing more. Of course I had a crush on this kid named Sam at the time, so you know, everyone else was like nothing to me. lol Anyways, I looked at him 2day, and he's really changed...he's no Andrew, and I know physical appearances shouldn't matter, but still, he's WAY hotter than he was b4...and then there's this other kid who's sort of a skateboarder, and has changed a whole bunch since last year in 7th grade. He's cuter ever since he cut his hair, and just the fact that he skateboards is cool lol. Uhh...I worked with him in EXPO last year, and he kept burning himself with the glue gun for fun. We all thought it was so funny. But we were all SO impressed by the way he could build houses out of like these popsicle sticks. Any ways, that's way off topic, and the point to be made is that maybe Andrew's not the only one, maybe I need to open my eyes a little more.
