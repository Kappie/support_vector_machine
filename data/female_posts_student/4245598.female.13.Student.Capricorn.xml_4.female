Your JuST A PIECE OF CRAP and every1 knws that... so i went home with ezowen and azlyn..and we went to 7-eleven cuz izyan wanted to buy something.       So she decided to buy mashed potato frm the machine..she asked me to place the cup for her cuz she's scared.lol. and the mashed potato came out i dunno. disgusting. it was all watery so we didn't knw as it was our first time and the evil cashier said that it won't be watery after some time. izyan went to the counter to pay. when she was putting the mashed potato on the counter SPLASH!!! it all fell. the cashier wiped the floor and another one came. cut short the story. the other cashier came and examined the machine and found out that the mashed potato had finished .. she added more and Izyan got her mashed potato and this time it didn't fall.lol.funny. she said it tasted delicious. right Izy???? : )                                                                                                                                                   Sign off,                                                                                                                                      Diana[the unknown]
