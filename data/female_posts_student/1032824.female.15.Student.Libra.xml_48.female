(changi sea sports club)  I guess you already have an idea of what i did yesterday hey? haha. yup, you're right. i went  kayaking ! val and i signed up for the  1 star course  which consists of two lessons, both from 10am-5pm.  Our instructors were  serene  and  charles . serene is a NPCC ma'am and i think she's in her twenties. she's very good looking. charles was from NCC and he's quite corny. we changed into our wet attire and intro-ed ourselves to our group memebers! there were 10 of us altogether. val and i were the youngest. most of them were in their twenties.. from poly.. uni..  :) we had a lesson and introduction on the parts of a kayak. then tried to paddle. all the different strokes. we learnt lotsa' stuff yesterday. mainly:  - embarking - disembarking - forward stroke - backward stroke - sweep stroke (360 degrees) - J-draw - capsizing - T/X rescue  I don't have any problems with all the strokes. capsizing is scary but the more i try it, the more exciting it becomes. however, you wouldn't like it when all the salt water gets into your nose. very annoying =\ i personally find T/X rescue the most difficult =( it has to be done in pairs. one person has to rescue, while the other has to capsize on purpose. then the rescuer has to paddle to the capsized kayak, somehow lift the damn heavy thing up onto his/her own kayak with the haul facing upwards to allow all the water to flow out. then your partner (the person who capsized with the kayak) has to hook both legs and arms on one side of the kayak so it appears to be a  see-saw . (both kayaks are in a  t  shape) then you hold on to the deck line and swim to the other side and do the koala-bear hug again. it the kayak tilts and all the water flows out again. later, flip the kayak back with the haul under water then you gotta climb up the kayak with the help of the rescuer, which is damn tough for me.. * sigh * especially when we did it in the deep sea because the waves were so huge =X plus, i'm so heavy! so i need lotsa' arm muscles. haha. i should train up. one time, i kept trying to jump outta the water and flip my body onto the kayak until i had a cramp on my calf. so pain sia! * tsk * i had to do it 3 times altogether yesterday, 2 times compulsory while the other was volunteerily. and all 3 times i got up with the help of my friend. * phew * :)  At about 5pm.. we ended and had to wash our kayaks and trolleys. it was quite fun, i love to play with water hoses. haha. i also spoke to one of my group member...er.. i forgot her name.. i asked if she was a  butch  =\ do you think i was being rude? i hope not.. cos she said she wasn't offended :) she also said that she wouldn't classify herself as a butch. so i just smiled at her and asked if she was ready to carry the kayak over to the shelf. teehee. she's soooo very nice.. she helped out in our rescue by anchoring our kayaks when we were nearer the shore. and she has such huge arm muscles! i learnt that she was a dragon-boater from her partner :) val,  charlene ,  joyce  and i washed our hair in public at the showers and pipes where everyone goes to to wash their kayaks, cos' the shower room was bombarded with peeps. then dried our bodies and got changed. debrief after everything.. and left for dinner with my seniors at changi village :)    WOW , what a day! and i got sun burnt too. but last night i put like duno how many donkey layers of mosturizer cos i don't want my skin to peel. it looks okay now.. gonna return to the usual colour soon. hopefully by tomorrow :)
