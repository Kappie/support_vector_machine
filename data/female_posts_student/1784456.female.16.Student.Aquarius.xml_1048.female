First we had science and I hadn't done the homework! So I had to copy it off of Izzy, but then it figured that we didn't have to hand it in! Aaarghsie! Then we had CROSS COUNTRY! Noooo! Which was hell by the way. We had to run around our school, oh yeah *run*, then out and to another school which we ran around, then back and around our field. It . was . so . much . fun. :| Not really. The only preperation we had for this was going around our school - once. So seeing as we such at fitness at the moment it was dead scary! Then apparantly we cut corners and didn't do it right so we have to do it again! AARGH! To our PE teachers - Piss off, not likely! My knee kills now and I remucked up my wrist. :( So basically, I'm not a happy bunny and I can't hop far. But at least I didn't bring the school down when I cooked macoroni *whatever* cheese *bigger whatever* Ugh, me tired!
