He was a boy/ and she was a girl/ can i make it any more obvious?/ He was a punk/ and she did ballet/ what more can i say? He wanted her/ and she'd never tell/ but secretly she wanted him as well/ and all of her friends/ stuck up their nose/ and they had a problem with his baggy clothes/ he was a skater boy/ she said see ya later boy/ he wasn't good enough for her/ she had a pretty face/ but her head was off in space/ she needed to come back down to earth/ five years from now/ she sits at home/ feeding the baby she's all alone/ she turns on tv/ guess who she sees/ skater boy rockin' up MTV/ she calls up her friends/ they already know/ and they've all got tickets to see the show/ she tags along/ and stands in the crowd/ and looks up at the man/ that she turned down/ he was a skater boy/ she said see ya later boy/ he wasn't good enough for her/ now he's a superstar/slammin on his guitar/ to show her pretty face/ just what he's worth  anyway. i'm sick still. and elder pattersons parents are leaving tommorow. and his dad kind of creeps me out, because he's sort of like larry nelson, with the back rubbing, and touchy-feely ness. i just don't like it man. anyway. i'm bored. and exaughsted. i mean, out of wits end. i am SO tired. this has probably been the worst week for me, in my entire educational career. jeez.better go. i've got stuff on. actually i don't, but i am really bored of typing, so i'm leaving. known around the house as: jules, julia, jul-iA (patterson and his thick north carolina accent.)
