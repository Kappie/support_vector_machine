To people like me , who are kinda bit cracked up in the head find it very interesting. The one thing abt change which fascinates me is that change is the only constant thing in the world and i sewr that is not my proffesors quote but i did hear it somewhere but i have forgotten it completly. In todays world we all are so much under pressure to keep on changing continuoulsy and evolving but the strange things i sometimes do wish that why cant we stop thinking what we have to do instead do what we want to do. And lets not be judgemental. I say a lot , I wish i could do it. I do it sometimes and that sometime is just once in a blue moon but whenever that time is ,it is bliss. I love being structured in a unstructured manner , you would have noticed i make thousand grammatical mistakes and spelling mistaked. I want to make a confession here, I have not mastered the art of being creative or for that matter expressing my traing of thoughts within grammatical boundaries.I wish i could, I wish one day i could write whatever i wanted without thinking twice and that would be acceptable to all sections of society which i know is a dream which will always remain a dream.U would be thinking I am so damn philosophical and serious.On the contarry I am an opposite person who is bundle of contradictions and i am an hypocrite too. I am not proud of it but i know i am , i am trying to improve. Anyways I better go otherwise I will again crib in the morning.   So chow, have a great night and i will end it by saying that"Life is the greatest Gift that you will ever get from God enjoy it till it lasts and have a ball" This would sound cliche but trust me it is true. (see ya )
