Going to lunch wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, although I still prefer eating in Mr. Powers's room 4a so I get to eat earlier.    Tidbits: ~Contrasted to yesterday, Mrs. Krull thought I was a senior today.  Thanks, you made my day!  But she also thought Kate and I were sisters, so.... ~Renae, I think Jason likes you.   ~Hanson is awesome! hehehe Don't give me that look Renae!  They so need to come to Sioux Falls! ~DBQs suck ass! ~Inventor of Oreos was a genius! ~I have that spacing out feeling again so I'm gonna.....go to bed
