It was cool, cause I knew McDonalds was gross, but now I know all about it, like how they only have 6 things on their menu that doesn't contain sugar, and their salads arn't one of them. Yeah well, now I figured out I will never eat at McDonalds, unless I am getting a Sundae or a McFlurry. Mmm, icecream. Well, I am going to stop this one now..I have things to do with my site..I decided I want to give it a "makeover," because I have nothing better to do. Kay bye..and until next time..love from your punkrockpromqueen!
