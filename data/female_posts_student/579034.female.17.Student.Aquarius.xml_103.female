I was walking down one of the wings in the mall today, and I saw these two old people a man and a woman on their old people mobility scooters laughing and going as fast as they could, racing each other.  How great is that?? That is deff gonna be Eirca, Mel, Deb and Me when we are like 80 with our old lady hair cuts and our stockings falliing aruond our anckles. And let us not forget the floral pattern house dresses that will become normal day attire.   LOL Being old will be fun if I have them with me. We are deff gonna be those old people that have been through so much together and like knew each other so long that we are sick of each other and like we yell all the time about who is going to die first.   Ah... the momor- well.. they aren't really memories cause they haven't happened yet.  So.... lets rephrase.... Ah... the (__insert word here__).... humm... what's a good word to put there? I dunno.  And OH MAN... I totally wanted to crawl into a corner and die today when I went into Finish Line. Now, Mick always tells me I look younger then him and I don't look my age and stuff but I thought he was just crazy. Okay, I was looking in Finish Line for this Jersey he wanted and when they didn't have it I just decided to return the shoes I had bought the other day and get the money back. So the girl goes "Didn't find anything to exchange these for?" and I said, "No, I was looking for something for my boyfriend but you guys don't have his size." and she goes "Boyfriend? How old are you?" Knowing what was coming I said, "17." and she goes "Oh my God, you look so much younger!" I was like "Yeah, I get that a lot." I wanted to like die.  Any ways... Lee Ann's sweet 16 tonight should be a blast and a half. I got a new shirt today and lets just hope my pants make it through the rinse cycle with out being destroyed. x0x
