Black is my colour, and I am even more pleased than I was a few days ago lol.   Anyways, what's new... my eng. teacher called me on Monday and I have to write one of the two entries for this personal essay/creative writing contest. I'm not even old enough. Anyone have ideas of a theme that involves 'privilege?' Or any idea what a personal essay is?   I'm flattered, obviously, but I'm still flipping out. Very anxious about making everyone proud - I'm a people pleaser, no doubt about that. *sigh* I'll live, no doubt. And I won't be too upset if I don't place, even if that is losing out on $500 to $1000. I don't need the money. I'm not a needy person.
