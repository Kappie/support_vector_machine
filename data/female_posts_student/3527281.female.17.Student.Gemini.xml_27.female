I'm so excited. We're leaving Sunday evening to go up to Port Clinton to stay at my grandparent's place. I called them this past Sunday to make sure we could stay at it. I talked to my grandpa and he said yeah, that it sounded good and everything. So then I called LeeAnne yesterday and told her and we were all excited. Then on the way to Brooke's baseball game yesterday my mom tells me that my grandpa isn't so sure now. It's not that he doesn't trust us, it's the people up there he doesn't trust. So he was thinking that he and my grandma could come up and stay with us, which I really don't want, not because they're my grandparents, just because it was supposed to be a get away thing for ME and LEEANNE. So I was not happy. But now he's just gonna meet us up there and make sure we get in okay, turn the hot water on, and tell one of the neighbors we're staying there. So it's all good as far as I know now. But I feel really bad saying I don't want them up there with me. I love my grandparents, but this is just a friend thing. A chance for us to get away. So yeah. We're going on Monday to Cedar Point and coming home Tuesday sometime. It'll be a lot of fun.  But today I was watching TV and the news was on and a cable broke on the Top-Thrill Dragster there yesterday or something. So isn't that just great! I hope nothing bad happens, like the place closes down or something. It's just my luck. Everything always gets messed up for me when I really want something to go right. Hopefully everything will work out. The hardest part will be actually getting there.  Okay, I get on the internet just now and the MSN homepage opens up and there's this ad for State Farm Insurance to see which cars were most stolen in 2002. So I click on the ad just for the heck of it to see. I figure it'll be expensive cars or something. So the page loads and I look. Guess what is number  2  on the list?  Honda Accord. MY CAR!! Great. One more thing to worry about. You know what this means, LeeAnne. We have to guard our babies!!  *sigh* So I started the Hillsdale team blog. I just gotta wait for everyone to join and then it'll be great.  The link is www.blue-and-gold.blogspot.com  Well the organ/piano player/youth choir director at my church FINALLY called me about piano lessons today. I was in bed when he called and the phone kept rining and I was really getting ticked off. Thankfully the machine picked up. So hopefully I'll be starting piano lessons soon because if I want to be a music major, it'll help.   I thought I was going to go on a few college visits this week, but it looks like we're not going. We were gonna go over to Bluffton and Ohio Northern. But who knows! I want to see Kent sometime too, just to keep my options open. So far though I am definitely leaning towards OU. SO MANY DECISIONS!  Okay well I need to get off and start making lunch. We're having my favorite: corndogs. Yum.
