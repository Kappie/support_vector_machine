This girl in our school Lynne heard in the loo *just nod* talking to her friends about how she had a square butt! *okay, they weren't in the loo, lynne was they were outside doing... whatever they do i dunno! brushing their hair?!* Phew, dug myself out of that one! Kind of... Then in Tech when she walked away all her 'friends' were saying "No don't worry, it looks rectangular to me!" Geez that's sad, who cares! Why do people have to be so preened up that they care about their butt? Isn't their more to life than looking like a Barbie doll? (Apart from acting like one? :P) Mind you, this girl is a bitch. Why is it that some girls I know *so people won't be offended* get a tiny inkling that they look 'nice', so they go and tart themselves up and start being bitchy? What is this, some kind of fashion? POWER TO INDIVIDUALS!!!! Yeayyyy! I seriously think I would be murdered alive in a American high school!
