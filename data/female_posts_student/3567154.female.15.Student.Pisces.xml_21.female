Yea Tuesday i went to ceader point with Jake and his family it was cool. I was kinda in a weird position cuz like i don't like coasers but i went newayz it was a lil weird. But o well i still had a ton of fun. But yea. yesterday was my day to rest i did absolutly notheing like all day long. I was gonna mow lawn today but it looks like it is gonna rain and it is really REALLY cold outside. so o well  i guess whatever!  I can't wait till sunday i am hoping my mom will let me go and see Spirder man and go with Jake and go do our sunday thing. I like going and doing stuff on sunday it is fun and relaxing. But Jake wants to go eat at newport so one of the ppl he works with can meet me. Tim still scares me i don't really know why he just kinda does. O well...ok loss of things to say peace out
