Last Way Out Of Here by Paloalto.    Running faster through the trees Feeling nothing underneath Your eyes are opened wide Let it come in Looking for the laughter show Is it out there anymore? Your head is lifting up to see how far to run  And you're feeling who you are And you don't care who it is How do you feel? And you're barely wonderful And you don't care if it hurts How do you feel? It's the last way out of here  Falling backwards Broken knees Waiting to be in between You lay just where you are Feeling amused Yelling, screaming on the floor Louder than you were before You might just bite your tongue When you're reaching for the world  And you're feeling who you are And you don't care who it is How do you feel? And you're barely wonderful And you don't care if it hurts How do you feel? It's the last way out of here  When all your walls are down When all your walls are down There's love  And you're feeling who you are And you don't care who it is How do you feel? And you're barely wonderful It's the last thing that you think And you're feeling who you are And you don't care if it hurts And you're feeling loved That you can't hang on It's the last way It's the last way  Stop to think (when all your walls are down) When all your walls are down Then there's love You take in what you give in When all your walls are down When all your walls are down Then there's love It's the last way out of here
