Guy: Then tell me you love me.  Girl: I love you. now slow down! Guy: Now give me a hug *Girl Hugs him*  Guy: Can you take off my helmet? It's bugging me.  In the paper the next day: A motorcycle crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it. Only one survived. The truth was halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him, felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so she would live even though it meant he would die.
