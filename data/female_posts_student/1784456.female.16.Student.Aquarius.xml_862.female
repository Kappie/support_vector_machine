I need to de-rust this metal sheep called Reg and I need to write out a load of Spanish, kick some guys ass on FFX and give Broadie a hug. (You really had to think to ask, didn't you?) Hehe, they didn't! Well... their's no out out there and unless the little green men have come back again! HEY! COME BACK WITH MY COUNTER! *beats them with a citrus flavoured HTML script* Hehe, that should teach them! Hey... don't go... Or do, it's your choice, as far as I know (which is about 2cm of sugar tape) this is still a free country and hey, we're not in Iraq are we? Well... I hope we aren't! Hmm... maybe some people came and picked up the house and flew it over to Iraq? Maybe my imagination is too big... Hehe, that would be funny! Imagine seeing a house fly past! Ok, so now they picked it up and started flying, it was stupid in the first place! Oh Izzy! Mr Fopple!  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/020802/140/d6koc.html  Things get a bit freaky don't they... I'm gonna go hug Broadie!
