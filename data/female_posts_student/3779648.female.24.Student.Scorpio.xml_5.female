Yup, i almost dont belive it myself to be honest! Its very strange to think i will be a wife.. but also very cool:) I am very happy and excited about it. I feel that it cant come fast enough. The lucky guy is Andre.. lol. Well, maybe i should say i am the lucky one:) Or okay, we both are! Now, the thing is.. andre lives in Germany. And yes, i still live here in michigan but that will be changing soon. Like i said, not soon enough. I really cant wait to get on with my life. I want to start my life with him and be with my best friends. I will be able to get my back fixed after we get married (which will be early nov. i guess.. not sure on an exact date) and then i can go to school! i will learn german again:) And i will also be able to work then too! I will help him run his buisness (a Subway near to Hannover). And down the road from nowim sure i will get another job as well, after my german improves of course..lol.   I just told my mom about 2 hours ago. That didnt go very well at all. I didnt think it would but at the same time i didnt think she would be QUITE as mean as she was. She doest believe me for one thing.. i wish she would only because its really going to happen. And well, even i know its a crazy thing to do but i dont think its neccisary to put me down and laugh in my face either. Anyway, im just really mad at her right now. I know she will eventually get over it and so will i but in the meantime i cant stand to even be around her. She said that anyone that cares about me at all will laugh in my face and say the same thing she did. If thats true then im not going to bother even wasting my time telling anyone because i dont really care anymore about what other people think. I cant. Something that i cant get over though.. she always tries to make me feel so bad about myself by saying "you always do what you want to do!" Well, what the fuck am i supposed to do!? thats really want i want to know! Am i supposed to do what SHE wants me to do? Or wait, maybe what my dad wants me to do! My sister? my friends? Hell no! I am not living for anyone but myself until the day i have kids and you know what.. im NEVER going to please everyone. never. So why should i feel guilty about doing what i want to do? That is really so fucked up! I wish i would have said that to her in the moment too. I didnt because all i could think was "no actually i really dont always do what i want to do" Sure, i do sometimes. Why wouldnt i? But i think i should be doing what i want ALL the time. If this is selfish.. well call me selfish then cuz im sick and tired of trying to do whats "right" for everyone else!  Now, i told my dad, step mom, and grandma this weekend up north. Of course they were shocked and had many questions for me.. but thats why i love them so much.. they will be supportive and accept me no matter what i want to do. I am way more like my dad in that way, and i love that. I cant even say that he doesnt want me to go! Because he knows that if i will be happy and i want this then i should do it. That doesnt mean that he doesnt think its risky but he has at least a little trust in me as a person and i really wish that my mom was more like that.   Leaving my family will be so hard i know. Marriage alone will not be easy, on top of moving 5,000 miles away and leaving everything you know behind.. but its what i feel is right for me. So, good times, bad times.. i will make it in the end. Hell, i always do! And im also not so nieve to think that everything will be perfect and effortless.. it will take work. But, its not impossible by any means:) Not even for me.  I really have so much more to say.. but Erin is here now with dinner and we will be watching big brother and amazing race! damn, ill miss that shit! gotta take the bad with the good though!  life status: alive relationship staus: engaged (in a weird way without a ring..lol)
