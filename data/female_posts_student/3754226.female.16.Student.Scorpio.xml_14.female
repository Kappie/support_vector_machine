     
      open my eyes  To see nothing but darkness  I tried to hide  But I could still feel the creeping emptiness   I feel my eyes turn crimson  As I run to nowhere  Burning sensations…  Will my soul be spared?   I am swallowed by inexistence  Slowly gaining unconsciousness  Lingering in wretchedness  Embracing unto death’s roots   Held by insanity  Devoured by desolation  Saturate my spirit…  Before I am lost into oblivion
