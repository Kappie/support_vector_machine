I am feeling much better so ignore the previous post. i was basically typing out how i felt at that moment. i didn't mean it. on a brighter note, my lil' sister and i have reconciled. haha okok it wasn't that serious but we ignored each other for a night. she designed a postcard and apologised to me. that was before i went for my  kayaking 1 star course  on sunday. *sigh. like, she stayed up til' mid night to do that for me... i said sorry to her too.. because i also made her cry and i wouldn't say i wasn't in the wrong because  i was . as an older sister, i really should've handled the situation by giving in to her. my dad reprimanded me for that. anyway!! now that we've made up, i would so love to squeeze her cheeks =D i want to be a better older sister. i wonder if i am a good one.. people say i am like a mother to them. but at home, it's tough for my lil' sister to respect me and treat me as a role model as much as i wish her to, because i  do not  set a good example! remember i have a list of accomplishments which i want to achieve? i have added that in.. in fact, i have longed to be a good older sister since i was younger.   After assembly today, i went for a lil' shopping spree and spent quite a bit. i felt good letting go some money. anyways, i am off to fill my stomach. so take care ya'll =) lotsa' love and friedrice
