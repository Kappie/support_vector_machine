I asked Chris to give him a haircut because his hair was really getting long over the ears and in the back and, of course, I didn't want my baby to have a mullet! So, Chris buzzed it! It was shorter than I had imagined (shorter than Chris had imagined, too, I think). I was so upset that I made myself sick with tears! He didn't even look like my baby! But, with time I have gotten used to it. Grandma Patty says he looks cute and it's not so bad. He is quite a baldy, though. Thank goodness hair grows back! The worst part was that he was deathly afraid of the buzzer the whole time. He cried through most of it so the haircut/buzz didn't exactly turn out perfect. I couldn't help much because I was too traumatized! I am fine now, though.  My backaches seem to be getting slightly better since I have been using more pillows and a few Tylenol every night. The baby is still kicking, but not all days are active. Sometime S/He just likes to rest. Can't wait to schedule an ultrasound on the 16th of Aug. I really want to know what this baby growing inside me is going to be!
