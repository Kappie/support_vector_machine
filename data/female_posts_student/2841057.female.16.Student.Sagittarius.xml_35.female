I told her that I don't have enough money to buy her a great gift kaya ganun lng ung gift ko for her. But I'm damn glad that she like it very much and actually, she said that she often wear it. She also said that it is the one that she'd been lookin for at the malls and she is so happy that I gave one for her. Well, I'm even happier for her. IT just means that I'm a good crafter. And you know what? I think she likes it evry much better I made it so special, just for her. *If you're reading my blogs, You're welcome! Ã¼*
