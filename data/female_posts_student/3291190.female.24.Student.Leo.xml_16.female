Peering out into the world, but out my window is just an empty street Listening to my own soundtrack, one monotonous step after another, watching my feet I pad down this lonesome road, and inside my head I think about my future, confused and full of dread Do you think my life will sparkle or give me wings to fly? Or will I stand behind some dirty counter, watching the minutes drag by Filling my day with monotonous tasks,  And jumping whenever someone barks orders, doing whatever they ask Will I wonder where my dreams went? And wonder how my passion slipped away? Drifting back….living off happy memories of yesterday There is a conventional life waiting for me, with plenty of responsible things do I refuse to live life bye the rules just to appease you Follow me  Slip into my dreams… Come with me to experience the most bizarre things I sit alone; squeeze my eyes shut, and dance to a silent song Pace my room, running circles around ideas, painting all day long Suddenly I begin to laugh as I ponder what will become of me Tracing circles around a photograph of where I used to be
