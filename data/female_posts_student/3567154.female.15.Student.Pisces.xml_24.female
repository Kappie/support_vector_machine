One lets get this stright it is my section too not just YOURS and i was mad at one of them so you know what just shut up now. Too I never treated you like a whore if i had done that i would have belive that u and Jacob did something that would be treating you like a whore. And last but not least, how do you think you have the right to say that Jake and i our relationship "dead on the water" Do you live our lives or spy on us and know every tiny thing that we do? NO i don't think so!! So how can u tell me wut we are. You have no idea. So I wanna know who gave you this idea that u can just go around tellin Jake and I what and how our relationship is?? Stay in your own relationships and stay OUT of mine. I guess i thought if i left you alone you would leave me alone but i guess that ain't the case. Oh yea i don't want you to forgive me even tho you have to reason to be pissed at me you are the one that lied to me!!! Ok I am done with this sh*t!!  Ok now on a happier note. Well i don't know how much happier but more pleasent thats for sure. I have been so busy the last three days. Thrusday i went and did the concert in the park. That was really fun. Elizabeth Ward played with me when i played with the little kids. Hooch and Jason Ward played trumpet with all three of the bands too. I didn't play with the 6th graders cuz i let the percutionist play the stupid cymble part. Well after that i went out to eat with Jake and his parentals. I saw Jake and Harper there. They were being dorks. They were puttin the bibs on there heads and around there necks like capes. LOL it was accutly funny. But yea then Jake came back here and we chilled for a bit.  But yea then yesterday i cleaned bathrooms, did the dishes, and took out all the trash and my mom still wouldn't let me go to see spider man with Jacob i was so sad. O well. I have a feeling that Tre will go see it today but i ain't going with him he pissed me off to much yesterday. O well i guess. Today i gotta clean my room and mow the lawn. yippie joy joy. NOT!! O well. But tomorrow i get to go see fire works with Jacob. YAY! This should be FUN FUN FUN.I love fire works. but yea then Monday my mom has off. Maybe we can go somewhere so i can drive. O yea did i mention that i got my permit the other day. I was sooo happy. LOL. but yea. Then Tuesday i get ot go to Ceader Point with Jacob and family.(excluding Mr. Turner.) T has a class he has to go to in Chicago. He is gonna be there with Hutchie. :( i miss Hutchie. I wish we could get him back i mean i like Franks and all but he just isn't Hutch. But ok i am done talkin i need to go mow lawn and call jacob to see what is up with him. love ya Jake P34(3 0|_|7
