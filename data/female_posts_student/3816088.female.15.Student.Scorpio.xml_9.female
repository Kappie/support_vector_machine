I woke up around 11:30 and then just laid around the house and did chores and then finally around 4:30 I went driving with my dad until about 5:15 or so because we had to get home for church....  but then when we were pulling out to go me and Mitchell noticed that one of the wheels was like almost totally flat so we had to stop at a gas station to like pump it up and check it and all that good stuff...Well just our luck...Someone was pumping up their tire too. By the time we FINALLY got our pumped and all even with all the other tires it was 6:10 and church starts at 6 and it takes about a good 10-15 minutes to get there. So my dad decided it was best to skip so we didn't like just come for communion like some people really do. So yea we didn't go to church and OMG!! That is like the first time we have EVER skipped. Besides like when we are on vacation and absolutely cant find a church. So yea Ill just say my mom was a little pissed at my dad but it wasn't like he had any control over it and we didn't want to have a blow out so I guess there is a good reason to skip but my mom told us to go and say our rosaries tonight. lol that's my mom for you..The married motherly nun!  Well I'm going to go because there is absolutely nothing exciting to tell you!  I love you  heather    *mindy* hey my dearest llarrintt sister!! Good luck with moving today! I guarantee that KC wont be bad at all. You will make soo many more friends and stuff and I PROMISE I will fly up there and visit you, I don't care if its a longer flight I'm going to come no matter what because remember we WILL be friends until we are like 105!! Don't forget I'm always here for you if you need me. Good Luck and have fun!! I love you soo much!  **Your Llarrint sister
