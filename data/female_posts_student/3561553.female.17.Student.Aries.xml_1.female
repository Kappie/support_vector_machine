Everynight i wanna die, but thats not the way i was taught I feel like there is something missing, something deep down in my heart. I get that feeling now all the time, but especially when were apart. Those 14 months were the best of my life, But since we broke up, i have experienced nothing but pain and strife. I realize now that i need my life back, whether yer a part of it or not.  I cant go on living in this depression, i need to face the truth i've fought. So please make up yer mind, dont string me along like yer pet.  I have my own needs too, and i dont believe their being met. So leave me now or leave me never, and remember that if you leave me now, you'll be leaving me forever
