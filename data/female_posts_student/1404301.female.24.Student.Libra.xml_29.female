I started fencing because I loved Zorro when I wsa a kid, and I didn't want to do the same sport as my brother.  I will talk about this fantastic sport regularly because I love it. I would like to give you some information about it and today I thought I would start with the number of weapon that you can play:  -  Foil         It is he lightest, you can hit only with the point and the target area is represented by the figure below (red area):        -  Epee         It is the heaviest, you can only hit with the point and the target is represented by the figure below (red area):        -  Sabre         You can hit with the point AND the blade and the target is reprsented by the figure below:        In terms of rules, epee "doesn't have any rules" which means that the first to hit the other gets the point and if the two fencers hit each other at the same time there is a point for each of them. Foil and Sabre work on the same rules: there is a pripority to the fencer who is attacking.   In the next lesson, I will talk about the equipment needed to fence.  If you are interesting in this sport and want to find more about it, I advise you to look up on the website of your country's federation.
