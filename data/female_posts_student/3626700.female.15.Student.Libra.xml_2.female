I give it my all, and thats all that counts.  In first place, myself, i seldom find. So I push it to the limits- I wont be left behind  Some people say you can't. Some say don't. Some simply give up. i reply, I won't.  The power is here, locked away in my mind, My perseverance is my excellence. I won't be left behind.  Make the best of each moment. The future is soon the past. the more i tell myself this,  The less i come in last.  Throughout my competitions i learned what winning is all about,  a plain, clear lesson: Giving up is the easiest way out.  So every night before i go to bed i hope in a small way i have shined tomorrow is a brand new day and i wont be left behind.    I wrote this poem while i was living at my dad's house. It got me through a lot. And sometimes to this day, it still gets me through...piece by piece. but for the little things now. I automatically remember it when im being challenged. From just test to other things that i have to go through in life. But now i have the Lord for my stength to get through. That, and i finally have love, that love that gets you through a lot. The Lord has donnne sooooo much in my life, i am soo grateful to just be alive. He has saved me and made me conquer all my quest. HE can do the same for you to...all you have to do is have faith.    "He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases strength. Even the youth shall faint and be weary. And the young men shall utterly fall, But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strngth; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint." Isiah 40:29-31  Powered By God's strength,   Samalamadingdong.
