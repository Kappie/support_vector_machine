I WENT OUT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING WITH MY GRANDFATHER, AT MARIES, BUT WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE ENGLISH MUFFINS, GRUMBLE, BUT THE KOLACEK WAS ECCELENT. I BOUGHT TWO NEWSPAPERS, A SPLURGE THIS MORNING, THE NY TIMES, AND WALL STREET J. ANYWAY, ABBREVIATIONS ASSIDE, I AM THINKING ABOUT MY BOOKS THAT I'M INTO, GO DOWN MOSES BY FAULKNER, A BOOK ON GREENLAND BY EHRLICH, A BOOK BY PELEVIN ENTITLED "HOMO ZAPIENS", AND A NEW ADDITIONAL INTERESTING DIGRESSION, IN THE DEVILS BY DOSTOEVSKY, TRANSLATED AS EVERYTHING I READ IS.  I HAVE WORK NOW.  BYE. ALISIA
