A stir of life every now and then would be nice, eh? That's the second time I used "eh" in a sentence, once as a question, once as a stand-in for a period. I must be turning Canadian! Cool. Maybe I can be a Mountie. I hope they give me a huge stick, either that or put me on artillery/rock thrower. I really wish I knew what the hell is wrong with me. Actually, I can hear my dad laughing himself to a hemmorhage in the next room, that's probably fueling the fire. I don't know.    sometimes it's just better not to ask   Rock on, all.
