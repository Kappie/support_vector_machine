No! you can't have any money! hmm, in other news, I went with Chelsea to this place called Pottery for you and Beads too! It was fun, though Chelsea took FOREVER to finish painting her clay figurine. The guy that worked there was 16, and he was flirting with me AND Chelsea (who is 19). lol. He found out she was 19 and sorta backed off after than. Of course, I didn't enjoy him flirting with me or anything. OOH! TOMMORROW IS SATURDAY! I'm so excited!!! I mean, overjoyed! wahoo! I can't wait! anywho, after we finished at the pottery place, we went to the ickle Fair that was in the Books-A-Million parking lot. We rode The Ring of Fire, and I got to hang upside down for 30 seconds over 60 feet in the air! The view of Huntsville was great from up there. LOL! Chelsea was so nervous about being up there though. I wanna go ride it again! I fear no ride! What I really wanna do is go to the Morgan County or Lincoln County Fair and ride all the scary rides there. I'll show everyone up sooooooooooo bad. hehehe..I love roller coasters! ooh and I got my hair done today. It looks so pretty..and blonde. lol, really blond. People won't recognize me tommorrow when they come over. It looks sexy *wink wink* MY COMPUTER IS BEING HOMOSEXUAL AGAIN! I think we'll have to wipe the memory on it out entirely and start over again. I'm writing this on my parents' computer. Well, I'm starting to write almost as much as Chelsea does. I might wanna stop before I write an entire book. Oh, and Nick, if you read this, I want ya to know something........I LOVE YOU!!! -- Shannon  "Pray for mercy from PUSS...and boots." --Puss 'n Boots from Shrek2.
