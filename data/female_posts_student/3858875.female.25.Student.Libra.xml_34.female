Last week we were out cycling, and I got ticketed for not wearing a helmet. i'd been wantonly breaking this law for quite a while. to be honest, i resisted getting a helmet for over a year because whenever chris wears his helmet, he ends up with triceratops hair. but now that i've been fined, i thought i needed to take action.   i got a helmet. it sounds so minor, but i never thought i'd do it. given the popularity of the new cruiser bikes, I wish that cycling companies would come out with equally well designed accessories. i did find a helmet that matches my cruiser, and the girl at the shop assured me that i won't have the same hair probs as chris. i've tried it once now, and i think she's right. yay! although i'll no longer feel the wind through my hair, i think i'll feel more secure tearing through the streets and less sheepish when i fly by cops. i hope i get to keep the name though - it's quite endearing.   UPDATE: Last night we went on a half hour bikeride, and after a quick brushing, my hair fared just fine.
