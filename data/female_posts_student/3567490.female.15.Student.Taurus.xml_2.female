Came back from the trip...honestly speaking,i'm not feelin anything, no happiness, no sadness...just ok...i'm back in S'pore... Am i trying to be myself? or am i just tryin to be like smone? tryin to break the stereotype?dots...i'm getting lost...in myself... I think a lot...to the surprise of many people, and i act a lot, much to the surprise of more people, and i keep and hide secrets, so contrasting to the supposed happy-go-lucky who laughs a lot?(thou sm pple tot i laugh v weird?in a -ve sense i mean) hmm...i really do not express my thoughts usu, not my true ones...really...i often wait for the others to take their initiative to make theirs before i do...and mine usu follow theirs(70% true)...but 30% not really...sm are kept hidden...and i'm gettin used to keepin them hidden...cos no one bothers finding out... i sound pessimistic but i'm supposed to be optimistc, judgin fm the way i console pple...i've double characters...the other one has always been hidden, and it is feelin bored...and it wants to come out...sounds scary? i think i think too highly of myself? i think i'm always lookin for excuses? i think i'm trying to reason myself? i think i'm too nice to be true? i think i'm left out? i think i dunno wad i'm thinkin... i think i'm tryin to find acceptance by toking bad abt pple?? i dunno...i'm losing myself.. read a junior's blog...in total shock...had always expected myself to be v observant...shocked that her true feelings were like this...the world is not so innocent, people are jealous,just that they dun show...maybe she gave me the inspiration to really pour out my feelings...reality is the most cruel thing on earth...i wan to be an innocent girl...where has the girl went to???
