So some one sweep up the cobwebs that'll gather and clean out the flooble box cause Izzy's used it too much. :) :) :) Hehe, aren't I nice? So any way... the point being...? Oh yeah, this won't get updated for a few weeks so you're just gonna have to walk over the links or dig through the arcive... or leave compeletly whatever! Geez, I dig myself into holes don't I? Oh hey I entered a poetry competition! Let's have a vote, last or second to last...? Hmm, tough choice!
