But washing the car is really hard stuff for us. So I told Leah if she has $10 we could drive over to Mikes Car Wash and get it done and dad will think we did it. Well, she agreed. She agreed to it only if I go.  I was like ok, 2 minutes of torture isn't as bad as 1 hour or more. So my dad came in the house to check his E-bay stuff, and we made our get-a-away then. So yeah, we go through the car wash and I have my choking spells and what not. But I survived. Maybe I survived because Scooby Doo and Mickey were washing themselves too, so I felt safe. Well we make it back home to find dad hasn't moved from the computer. Mission accomplished. Leah finishes vaccuuming out the car and all goes well.      Moving on, today was an okay kinda day. I woke up a little after 9 to see if we were going to church. Mom said no, so I went back to bed til 12. Then I got up, looked through some ads and then that is when the whole car washing situation came. That got done and dad asked us to go get him some chicken at KFC. Of course, we did. Then I finally got around to taking my shower when I heard my brother Dustin was coming over with his girlfriend Krista. After my shower, dad said he had some places to go and if I wanted to go I could. I did, and so I asked Leah too. But as we were about to leave Dustin shows up followed by Krista. So Leah stayed home and my dad and I went out.  We went to Pep Boys and Meijer.  Dad didn't get what he was looking for a Pep Boys but he did buy some car air freshener that smells very good.  By the way, my dad did question what Leah and I wash the car with and thought maybe he should buy us  some special kind of soap to help us. I told him not to bother with it cause we dont't wash the car that much. Sheeeeesh, that was a close one. Anyway, we go to Meijer to see if they might have had what he was looking for, but no luck. So we went back home to find Leah, Dustin, Krista, and Leah's friend Shannon playing Phase 10. I just went to my room and slept. I thought maybe we were going to get ice cream but dad ordered them all pizza so I assumed ice cream was out of the picture. But o well, they ate all the pizza which helped me from the temptation to eat it. So now it comes to me just sitting here writing this out.       Ok, well now you know of another phobia of mine. I am a pretty strange individual. Well, nothing more to say tonight, so I am outtie!      Music Playin' in The Background-  All Cried Out-Allure
