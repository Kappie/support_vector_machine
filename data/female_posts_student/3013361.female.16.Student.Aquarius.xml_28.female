You don't chill with your friend when you're 30 and they're like "so what should i name my kid?" and your reply most definitely will not be "well, let me figure out what x equals and then I'll factor this equation and I'll have the answer for ya!" NO THAT NEVER HAPPENS.  I did a survey and 4 out of the 4 adults I asked (all over 40) if they'd ever used algebra, or trigonometry after school they all said a big fat NO! It's pointless I tell you. Not to mention I'm learning virtually nothing because my teacher is crazy. Completely insane. She also is ugly which makes it hard to concentrate. She also has weird habits of making little strange comments. But if I listed all the reasons I can't learn in that class we'd be here all night! In conclusion Math Sucks. I even made a little song about it. It goes like this.  Math is gay Today is april fools day I'm not fooling though Math is gay and it's a ho I hate this math I'll never use it wish i could burn my book  That last part didn't rhyme but it's true nonetheless and i don't know how math can be gay or a ho but you know. Ha, I rhymed.
