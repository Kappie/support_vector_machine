He's got a job at the Prospect Resturant (about 15 seconds from my house) and he's excited for the talent show so I'm happy for him. I think I'm gonna go to the talent show (??). That should be cool. Well I just can't wait for this week to be over. It is crazie. Eh, whatever, everything works out in the end right? I hope so.   Well right now I'm listening to "Like the Angel" by Rise Against and wishing that I could play bass and be in a bad. That would freakin awesome. I'm also downloading some Rooney songs right now and looking up information on Japanese immigration for English. Rooney is a good band. I love music. It takes me away from all my problems. It takes me to a place where I'm happy and normal and I don't have to think about my problems. Music Saves Me.  Song- Like The Angel- Rise Against
