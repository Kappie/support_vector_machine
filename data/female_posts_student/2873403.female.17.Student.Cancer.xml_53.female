But I found out something from my best friend last night and even after all the fun I had, to be quite honest, I went home and cried. Not even the best night ever can save you from the truth.  You pretended to be some other girl's boyfriend. While we were still together. Not just "Hey I'm her boyfriend." You put your arms around her and everything. Then you blame me for keeping shit from you, shit that wasn't even my fault, it wasn't stuff that I did out of free will, but what you did was. You blamed me for everything. You just needed an excuse, it sounds better than saying "hey I don't give a fuck about you anymore." You blamed me for everything so I would come out looking worse than you. So you wouldn't have to hurt nearly as much as I do.  Just when I thought it couldn't possibly hurt any worse, here I am.  I want nothing more than to be completely motionless.
