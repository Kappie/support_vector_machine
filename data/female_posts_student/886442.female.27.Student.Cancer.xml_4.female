What you will find in Ceren's Garden is a collection of information about me, my booklogs, a weblog, and anything else that I find worthy of mentioning. My writing here is obviously intended for an audience but I also intend it as a manifestation of my new life where I will start living out what I have been dreaming of and planning for all my 25 years. I know this last sentence sounds weird to all those who do not know me, but I am afraid to those who do know me, it will sound just like me.         Ok. So who am I? My name is Ceren Arik and I am a Turkish woman of 25 who works as auditor at a foreign private investment bank in Istanbul, Turkey. I am Turkish and I had my secular education in an American school, which I am pretty proud of,  here in Istanbul and hence the English.   The first weblog I read was dear Karen Grünberg's  urlLink Karenika . I came upon her page while I was looking for some cool Istanbul pictures to send to an American friend of mine. I was at work and you're not supposed to surf the net while at work but I couldn't help it. I read half the content of her site (yes, including the archives) right that day and read the remaining half at home that night. At the end I started feeling like she was my friend but the problem was she wasn't. Still, the feeling was wonderful. I thought we had a lot in common as far as feelings go but we just reflected in ways totally different. She is this wonderful manic caring person (don't know if you'll agree with the 'manic' part, Karen) who's in love with life and who wants to make time for yet another wonderful activity each day.  On the other hand, I cannot handle the intense love I have for life and my amazement at its ways as well as Karen can. It turns out that I am depressed rather than manic. The manic and the depressed have a lot in common, that is something I have always believed in. But of course I am talking about a certain type of depressed. Mine is more a way of being, of existing, rather than a condition. Well, so much for depression anyway. You just make sure you read Karen's pages too along with mine. And thank you Karen for inspiring me the way you have for keeping a blog and trying to make the best out of life.   I have to go now, I'll take this up tomorrow from where I leave it, so see you then.
