They did a full body-scan, and found out that i had a tumor in  one of my Ovaries... so i freaked.. and i called your mum  and said: I'm really sorry, i know i'm gonna break your son's heart, but i have to break up with him, i was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and it's spreading to my breasts(???), I don't want him sad or leaving his studies because of me, so i'll just tell him that i can't stand the distance thing, and that i have to break up with him. And your mum was like: Oh, ok, i understand. So i called u up, and told u that i cudn't take the distance, being far away from you was killing me, and that eventually you wud get over me, and u just screamed WTF, and hung up on me. I called my teacher, and told him that i had a tumor, and that i was gonna leave the school, and try to follow home studies. Everybody was so sad and stuff, and visited me.... And u didn't know anything, u just thought that i was a bitch for breaking up with you for no reason...and  hated me. For like 4 years i did Chimio sessions and studied at home... Then the cancer left, and i graduated...So i decided to call you up and explain why the hell i broke up with you...and i called ur place and Vera answered , and said: escuta, ele num ta, ele saiu, and then your Brother grabbed the phone and started screaming at me, saying, you bitch, you call after 4 years, when he's all happy with another gurl, and you want to make him miserable, and you shud just fuck off, and i was like : Wud u pleassseee shut the fuck up so that i can explain to you why the heel i did that... so then he said, that he was sorry, and he gave me your cel number( which was my actual cel number...kinda weird) And i called, and i said: Hey Marcos, it's me, and you went,: Kate...? I said Yes, and i said: Ok, listen i know that you have a new girlfriend( called Patricia)...and u said: Fiancee, not gurlfriend. I said: oh, ok, sorry, my bad, fiancee...But i just think that i owe you an explanation about wut happened 4 years ago...And you said: listen i really don't want to know.. I'm over you , you made me suffer so much, but im over you, i found someone that's actually better than you. So i was like, Oh, ok...and u hung up on me. And i was in this flat on the Paulista..( the first place that i stayed at in Brazil)....and u called  ur uncle, who told u the hole story so u started searching on the net and calling people to find out where i was staying...and u lived in Sao Paulo and u thought that i was like in France or something but u where just beside my flat. And i kept crying and crying and crying...and then u called me up saying that u were downstairs in the lobby, waiting for me...so i said that u cud come up to my room...and i openned the door, and i was standing there with my bald head,  and u were like: wtf? and i explained to you, telling u that i didn't want to disturbe  your studies and that i wanted you to make your mum and dad....And i told you that your mum knew all the way...and u got so pissed off...and you were like saying that you were sorry, that you didn't know..and i was : yeah but i didn't want u to know.. i didn't want you sad... cuz i love you more than anything, and i didnt want u to suffer....  and we started crying.....And then i woke up, Crying.. A LOTTTTT!!     moral da historia: I'm fucked up...
