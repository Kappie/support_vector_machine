I called my mother over to look, and she exclaimed, "We're blessed!"  Perhaps not all buzzing leads to carnage, and perhaps sometimes you have to look up hoping for the best instead of looking down expecting something dreadful.  I was still sullen and angry today, brooding all night over things I should have said, remembering things that were said to which I could take issue. I imagined confrontation scenarios with everyone around me. "Hey lady, why don't you put some pants on your kid when you take him to the store?" "Don't you tell me how to raise my children, you don't have kids," "Oh yes I do, and I would never be rude enough to bring him out in public half naked.." from which point the imaginary argument became racial and degraded into irate babble. My mother, detecting my problem, bought me a bottle of Irish Cream.  I watched the offending neighbor lady today as she actually stood and supervised her children while they played. I wondered if she was inviting us to come out and resume our argument.  Perhaps she was only pointedly demonstrating that she was an alert parent. Whatever her motives, we were pleased to see she was actually watching them for a change. Funny thing, they were much better behaved. Who would have guessed?    With regard to certain New Yorkers who are not all the same, I would have to say that so long as said persons were not living in New York and offering to let me sleep in a dank basement while holding hateful conversations about me directly above and within earshot, I would be happy to come visit at some point. Otherwise, I would invite those persons to go jump in the Hillburn pond.   I told Mike that we should go live in the country on the mainland, and he sighed and leaned back, turning his face into the afternoon light to gaze at the mountains, and said "I just can't imagine living anywhere but here." It makes me so happy to see him content, but I fear we will have to leave before Gavin is old enough to have the Aloha Spirit wring him by the neck.  I'm considering reading up on Buddhist philosophy to deal with life. I get very tired of reading  philosophy that deals with the meaning of life, which I feel is fruitless. Rather, I'm interested in the philosophies of living. I may lack spirituality, but I still want to be a better person. Without any real suffering at hand to help shape my character, I suppose I need a book or two instead.
