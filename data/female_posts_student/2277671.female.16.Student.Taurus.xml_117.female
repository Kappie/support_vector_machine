Thats what happened.. i was gonna wake up early, do my hw [ flip book ] and take a shower, blowdry my hair... eat breakfast, buttfuck it, I just stayed in bed longer, got up, did my flipbook [ it sux ] and im gonna wait till 7, to go take a shower... Yeah i think i woke up too early. Well last night, Markus said he was gonna take the 7 o'clock [82] to my house.. and then walk to school with me, but he fell asleep [ on the phone] and i couldnt wake him up, so i dont think that is gonna be happening. I am supposed to go over his house, too, but i think his mom said no... she usually says no, then she says yes, i dunno, its confusing..?? Well yesterday i ran the mile, and i wasnt TOO tired, and had my geometry final, it was hella dumb, some of the stuff he hadnt taught us yet. I was so tired last night, i stayed on the phone/computer till 11, listenin to markus snore, and burnin cd's for his brother... then i wanted to go to bed hella bad but my aunt called and i had to talk to her for like an hour, then i went upstairs and my mom wanted me to lay with her so i watched j- leno with her but she fell asleep in like 2 minutes and every time i'd get up to go to bed, she'd wake up... but its aLL gravy. im gonna go take a shower right now, yup yup.. if i dont come home after school, everyone have a good weekend.     ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
