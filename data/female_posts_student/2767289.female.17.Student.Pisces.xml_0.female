My favorites, though, were My December, Oceano, Mi Morena, Remember When It Rained, and Never Let Go.    After the concert, Alisa, Catherine and Serge and I went over to stand next to the busses and wait for Josh to come out.  Surely, he did, but he just waved and blew kisses and hopped into the bus.  I understand its for health reasons and really because they had to leave for CA.  But anywho... we met the band (which is the next best thing, hehheh) and got their autographs and pictures.  Wow.  I never realized how easily approachable they are!  They're sooo nice!   Well...I still can't get over the fact that I have seem Josh LIVE!!!  It might take a while before I come down from cloud 9... heeheehee!!
