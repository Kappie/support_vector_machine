I wasn't sure what to expect and I didn't bring anything to read because I'm not really a writer, or at least I have never thought of myself as a writer.  I just went because LaChelle wanted me to and I thought it might be interesting.  I had no intention of reading anything.  But when we got there, we were given a topic to write about and I was actually able to come up with something.  It wasn't even close to what everyone else had written, but it was fun.  LaChelle's autobiography was awesome.  She makes me feel so inferior with the way she makes a story about her life sound like Shakespeare.  I don't even understand all the words she uses.  Ray's script was really cool and WB-ish.  J's story was great, as were Quentin and Jonathan's.  Everyone did a great job.  But back to the part about me not being a writer.  It's not that I can't write, but I'm just not usually inspired to sit down and write about something.  If I'm given a topic, then I can write like I did Thursday night.  I'm not saying it will be great, but I can come up with something.  But the really funny thing is that this morning I was totally inspired to write on three separate occasions.  And the topics were all completely unrelated to each other.  I probably shouldn't admit this part, but I actually stopped working to write down what I was thinking about and how I felt about it.  Words just kept coming to me.  I've never experienced anything like that.  So now I have three writings (I'm not sure what you would really call them) that I can share at the next writer's circle or open mic night.  The only problem is going to be working up the courage to share them with people.  That's the scary part.  If I get too scared, I'll just come up with some more OU haikus!  But I'm really excited that I actually almost felt sort of like a writer today.  Maybe I will be inspired more often.  I hope so because it's a cool feeling.
