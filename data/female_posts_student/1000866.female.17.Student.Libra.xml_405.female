Kind of a scary/sad/eye-opening experience that I don't think I should write about in here considering more peole than I thought read this.   Ah well, tonight was fun. I went over to Carson's to finish our Satire project. It was actually a ton of fun. We have to make plans to watch Chicago now. I've really missed spending time with her. And...David called while I was there!!! Aww, I iss him so much. :( I wish he'd come back from Georgia. Who likes Georgia anyway??  I really need to talk to Chris but I haven't had the chance. Ah well. Anyway, I think I should be getting to seep now. Gooood night all. I'm so glad my day finished well. I'm really glad I was with Carson. She was there today and she knows my day just wasn't going well. She was really there for me.   Au revoir...french rap is Godly. :)
