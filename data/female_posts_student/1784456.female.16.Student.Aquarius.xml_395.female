So anyway, new word for today: foosies; means: when you get depressed about some one else and/or there problems. So wahay I'm wierd! Laura had the foosies today because some one was upset... well not really but we were being upset for her. Hmm, I think David has a thing for Lynne! Hehe! Today has been fun though yeah bit mad though! We made popcorn in tec and it was really nice! No one told me it was that easy to make! You just get a pot thingy (with a lit on) with a little bit of oil at the bottom, then you add a layer (1!) of dried corn and put the lid on over a mild heat (hey, that just sounds cool) and leave it until it stops popping and take the lid off and get hit in the eye with a piece of flying popcorn, then you get hit on the head by a giant piece of gold popcorn and some how end up in a wierd story type thing me and Sniz are writing! (Oooh, fun!) Hmm, guess it is nice knowing there are wierder people out there (if you mean you I take the as a compliment) Hey! Hmm... guess my other head is right... But seriously, we should all drink more ice! (Uhuh!)
