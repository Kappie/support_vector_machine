Tonight it was called "Painful Secrets" or something like that. It was about a girl who cuts herself because of all the crap in her life. And I can relate, I know a few people (very close to them) who cut themselves. The movie, in my opinion, was a bull shit look at a cutter's life. First of all, the girl in the movie didn't really have problems. Like  big  ones... Her parents frought a little in the beginning and she had no friends but her parents didn't scream their lungs out or beat each other. And no one actually made fun of her in a terrible way, it was bearable. Cutters don't really cut for the above reasons. They have  more intense  excuses. They feel like they have so much pain in their life that the pain they cause on themselves makes it feel like they have control over at least one thing. How much they bleed, how deep the cut, how long the cut, how many cuts...those types of things they have control over. Some, they do the first cut and then they just zone out until they're done, and  THEN  they realize what they just did and how bad or how much and so on. Most of them know what they're doing is wrong and harmful but it helps them and some aren't as extreme as others so it doesn't bother them. I know a lot of people will disagree w/ me but whatever: I feel if a person is causing harm to themselves in a small amount yet feels better after they do whatever is "their thing" then so be it. They're not soo extreme where they're gonna kill themselves so just let 'em be. But watch out for them to make sure they don't hurt themselves. I believe that if you know a person with a problem such as cutting or an eating disorder if you make it clear that they can come to talk to you anytime about anything, especially their problem, and if they talk to you, you can give them the help they need to stop and realize new ways of dealing with pain. sigh. The movie was just bad. It didn't even show how the girl really felt or how she started and why she kept going deeper and deeper. And her therapy sessions were nothing...  Lifetime, your movies suck!  Or at least do some research on the topic before you make a movie on it! Great, more drama, fill ya in later!
