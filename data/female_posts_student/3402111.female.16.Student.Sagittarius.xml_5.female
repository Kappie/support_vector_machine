Like in an office situation, you walk up to your close friend's desk and say, "Can you bring the Leopolf file up to me office later?" And what you really mean is I got something we need to talk about....  Of course this wouldn't be in a work-type situation. Afterall, it is only high school, and not even almost done.... halfway through high school. But it would be cool, no?  Speaking of only halfway through high school.... I think I am ready for college. At tech, I would walk down the streets alone absorbing the atmosphere, and I want that atmosphere. I want to get away. be me. become me. See what is really inside there....   Oh and a mystery was solved.... engaged
