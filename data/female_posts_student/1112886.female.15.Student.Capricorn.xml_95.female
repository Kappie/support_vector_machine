(u two will switch, anj u hav next week) the song of the week is platypus (i hate you) by greenday which goes very fast and only kelly can hear what they're saying. here it is: "Platypus (I Hate You)"  Your rise and fall  Back up against the wall  What goes around is coming back and haunting you  It's time to quit  Cause you ain't worth the shit  Under my shoes or the piss on the ground   No one loves you and you know it  Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care  Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you want  to hear.  I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU   I heard your sick  Sucked on that cancer stick  A throbbing tumor and a radiation high  Shit out of luck  And now your time is up  It brings me pleasure just to know you're going to die   Dickhead, Fuckface, cock smoking, mother fucking, asshole, dirty twat, waste of semen, I hope you die HEY   Red eye, code blue  I'd like to strangle you  And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull  When you go down  Head first into the ground  I'll stand above you just to piss on your grave  pleasant lyrics huh?
