       
      It's 10:18.  I think it's time to admit defeat, and start again, for tomorrow is another day.  I just pray that the good Lord gives me strength to make tomorrow more than just another day - to make it a productive day.  And not productive in the eat-ice-cream-and-watch-TV kind of way either.
