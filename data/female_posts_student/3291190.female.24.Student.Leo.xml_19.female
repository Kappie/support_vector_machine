And why didn't she get to finish hers? My mom said that maybe she finished what she was destined to do here. Is that true? If so, when will I be done  will I be ready when its time for me to go? It just makes me want to throw away all of the material possessions, stop wasting my life in the pursuit of money and actually acknowledge, listening to the person beside me. Maybe thats how we are supposed to live our life.
