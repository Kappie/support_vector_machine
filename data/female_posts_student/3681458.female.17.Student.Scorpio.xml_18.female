I am sick to think that I kissed him.  It is repulsive.  My stomach is in knots.  I would have liked to have thought that it was real.  It was all a lie.  I doubt he would have broken up with me before college.  Ugg.  I don't want to think about this.  I hate him, I am burning his paintings and pictures.  Anything that has to do with him, I am burning today.  Maybe I will send his mom the paintings.  Not sure.  Ack.  I don't want everyone to know.  I'm sure he doesn't either (but who really cares now...).  I am embarassed.  This will change so much.
