Maybe it's just the rollercoaster I seem to have been floating on and off of, or maybe it's just the fact that so much has changed so quickly that I can't even begin to grasp the effect of it all, the magnitude of everything. Ben left on Thursday and the entire time I just felt sick to my stomach. I went to Emily's house to get my mind off of things and everywhere I looked I was reminded of him in some little way and it hurt but not as much as the fact that now I have stepped away from the relationship, I can look back on things he has said or done to me and see just how stupid I was not to see it then. That as much as I wanted to believe it he didn't really love me the way I need to be loved. At first, I was just so..nauseous at the fact that we had broken up and that I could no longer look at him the same. The change freaked me out so much that I almost threw up Wednesday night. I couldn't sleep because I just felt so horrible and choked up. But now that the world is moving and the clock is spinning I'm feeling much better and much more optimistic about the future. School's going to be starting soon, My sister and Shane are moving back home, Jessie and I'll be heading out for some good shopping trips and Em and I will hopefully also hit the stores soon. Life looks pretty damn good right now so screw the opposite sex and bring on the fun...:) It's about time for rest and relaxation away from myself.
