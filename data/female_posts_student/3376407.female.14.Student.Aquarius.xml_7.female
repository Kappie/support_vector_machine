I've been loading this movie* for like 15 minutes and I still haven't gotten to the actual movie, all I've seen is like advertisements for like Target.  * Go to   urlLink  www.happytreefriends.com    : It's like violent cartoonscharacters who like, kill themselves in every episode. There's tons of blood and only sometimes do you feel sorry for the little guys, because they are soooooooooo stupid. :) We were at ECHO and Margaret showed some of us and we were all sitting there laughing because the guy was so stupid. :)  I have practice today and then I have to work, but by the way my coach said I'm allowed to bring friends to practice, so if any of you Gus swimmers want to come to practice with me, well please come. It's not all as bad as I sometimes say it is. :)  Song of the post: Avril Lavigne - My Happy Ending  Quote of the post: I won't admit or deny anything... makes me more interesting." - Orlando Bloom
