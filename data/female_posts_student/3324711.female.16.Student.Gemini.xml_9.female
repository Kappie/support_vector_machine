[that and hanging upside down at lunch and watching people jump.. but thats another story.] Anyway so hes having a good time.. Well he said he was but he sounded like he was trying to convince himself more than me. But hes spent almost all of his money so if it was me Id be having a great time!! He said he got me a present :D I love presents! And hes coming home on Sunday..3 days.  Even though I didnt go kayaking [again], it was one hell of a day. I love this sunny weather.  Shit.  Note to Self : Get new jeans.  Semi is next week! I cant wait. Its gonna be so awesome.. Tyler are you still going with Ellen? Or what is the deal there? Ahh, semi. What great memories from last year.. Contemplating wearing a skirt.. leaning towards a yes. Which is very, very difficult for me. But meh, semi comes but once a lifetime. Or twice if youre awesome like me.   Everyday she wears the same thing I think she smokes pot Shes everything I want Shes everything Im not   I should run.. Wheres Daniel when I need him.. but hes so gd fast and I can never keep up. By the end of the summer, my friend.. Not really I just like to think so.  Anybody else notice how fast this week went by?
