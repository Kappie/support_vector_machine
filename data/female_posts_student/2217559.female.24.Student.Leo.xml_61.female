I hopped into an open air taxi and cruised over to the beach resort, El Cid. I hung out and had lunch by myself, watched the ocean, thought about coming home and went to the pool. I listened to the entire cd of Shakira - apparently Mexicans think she should be played everywhere - they must be trying to reclaim her after this american stint. I got tons of sun in the short 3 hours I was out.  It was really nic eot be back in Mexico.  I am really really really looking forward to being in Puerto Vallarta tomorrow. We have this huge flaming gay group on called "The Pied Pipers"  and they are taking me to some gay resort in Puerto Valarta tomorrow.  It's called Blue Chairs or something?? I am going to do some research on the internet and see if I can get an idea before I go.  The last thing I want to do is parade around Mexico with a heard of naked "Gay and Away" travelers. Hehehe.  Nonetheless, Lisa and I areplanning to head to our own territory in the afternoon, "The Crystal" hotel and resort for some last minute memories before she leaves on the 5th.  I can't wait to have on of those pina coladas again.  Didn't I write earlier that I never wanted one of those again?? Hahaha.  well, nothing too new here folks.  Still on the ocean. Water is still blue and I still miss all of you. (Oh look, Jen, I made a poem - hehe).   see you in 29 days. remember when I had the 108 day count down??? we are getting closer here!  luv, shell.
