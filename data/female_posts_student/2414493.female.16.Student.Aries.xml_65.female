Then people come. Apparently, there's this new teacher in our area (could it be the one from USC W was talking about?) who studied with Bricard. Korean. Talented at piano, apparently. I have much respect for her.  It's great. These people have played so much that they just call it "Le Tombeau." Ok, so we'll have the Toccata from Le Tombeau first. I go play. It's not the best I've ever done, and even according to my standards it's not magnificent. But there are so many things I must fix, according to Ms. Bricard. She's a pedagogue six years into her retirement. Smallish lady, short brown hair, middle-class grandma type. For one, I need much more staccato technique, which calls for a spastic hand movement I can't match. It was pretty humbling: the new teacher had warned us beforehand that she could get a little excited and yell, and I found that to be true. I got a good loud NOOOOOOO! which echoed sharply in the sanctuary. Fingering concerns. Note accuracy, which is even worse. The footnotes comment. See, I knew I would just set myself up for this.  I guess it would have been all ok if it'd only been me, but S and N also played. Well. So I tried to be penitent, sitting still. But redemption in such circumstances is more difficult than that.  So now I am afraid to touch the Ravel. It, for one, will require a long session at the piano. And I've somehow screwed up my right wrist so that it hurts when I rotate it. I have no idea how that works. Plus, I have another master class at Colburn Saturday then the Bach Festival April 3. I just finished practicing a little Bach. Learning from today, I'm redoing all the funny fingerings in the fugue since I, as usual, was a sloppy student and made up my own fingerings which result in floppy hands and same-finger jumps. I hope it works. Remember what happened at Bach last year? I can't afford to put myself through that again.  Piano outlook: busy. I will have performed...five times this month. Hopefully, three more in the next month if I do well at Bach, but then I don't mind. I got lucky: Dr. Lepley from Colburn called today to see what I'd play Saturday, and I was playing piano. I was the last time she called too. Am I making up for last year's Panel flop? Maybe. But I'm going first Saturday. First last Sunday, first today, first in two days.   There must be something wrong in the wiring of my system. I remember I never had the nervousness problem as a little kid. As I got into elementary school, it developed more and more. And then last year it got better with the concerto performances. Now it's still a variable. Why am I scared of playing for an audience when I have no problems with public speaking?  Some pondering on piano to do.
