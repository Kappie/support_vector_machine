I don't know why I was so nervous, after all *if you've read before* I somehow went from invisible dancing nobody to part of a trio for the recital. Now my ballsy-ness was gone, totally gone, I swear I couldn't find it. So, chicken-shit me, lol, I spend the whole day at class and at the lab, debating whether or not I even wanted to go. (The first week is mainly going to the classes, meeting the student choreographer(s) and seeing whether you can do/or like each dance.)    First up I tried to take an advanced jazz class, yes I knew it was already a little out of my means, but I still wanted to try anyway. I was the only person there that hadn't been dancing since the age of 3. *Damn rich kids*...anyway they then proceeded to have a try-out of sorts with 40-60 girls lined up into four lines and then given directions very quickly.  "Pomerey, pomeray, double pirouette. Pomerey, pomerey, double pirouette."  I could do the pomeray's and that was it. Then the next batch went like this "ball-change, step, leap, leap, leap while arching your back as far as you could go, and emotionally throwing out your left arm."  I got so nervous that I kept forgetting what the hell I was doing with my legs that I used the wrong leg everytime. Did I mention the choreographer girls were watching the whole time, along with the whole group of dancers. After this, they wanted step ball-change side leap (toe touch) and then repeat. Um, there was no way I could possibly do this,  so I tucked tail and went downstairs to the beg/intermediate jazz dance . Good thing all my friends from dance were there because I was really flustered.  Next was the Britney Spears "Toxic" advanced jazz dance, (sidenote, I didn't want to do another britney dance at first since I'm going to my friends "Me Against the Music" advanced jazz dance.)  My trio partner was in it with me, I think it's going to be awesome...but Ashley for some reason was having issues with her long legs. lol.  Today I'm going to see how the beg/int jazz dance goes, it's supposed to be taught informally, the song is Alicia Keyes's "Heartburn". (Keyes's is right, I just learned it in my grammar class.)  But I'm really excited about thursday, there are a few dances I want to go to. There's one more on wednesday, but I don't really know about that one yet. After all, joing dance troupe is just for fun for me, a way to get out and get away from the piles of homework that I have.
