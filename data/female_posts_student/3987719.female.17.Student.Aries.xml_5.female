After losing two future hall of famers i n Alex Rodriguez and Rafael Palmeiro, Blalock has led this young team with his .303 average and 23 homers.   National League Midseason MVP Barry Bonds:   It's nearly impossible to consider anyone else, Bonds is by far more important to his Giants then anyone is to any team. Bonds along with Schmidt carrying the Giants with  maybe another batting title, and he  set the single season record for intentional walks only half way through. He is hands down the best player in baseball, and arguably the best hitter in baseball history.   American League Midseason CY Young Mark Mulder:   He doesn't have the best stuff or fastest fastball, but Mulder has been consistently the best SP in baseball. His team is 13-1 in his last 14 starts, with Zito slacking Mulder as kept his injury full team in the race. Mulder has been more dependable then any other AL sp this season with his 12-2 record and 3.21 ERA.   National League Midseason CY Young Jason Schmidt:    Might seem like i'm favoring the Giants players, but Bonds and Schmidt are clearly the best two platyers in baseball. Schmidt 12-2 with a 2.38 ERA is just amazing. Bonds might be the only run support he has, and to see a 12-2 record is very impressive.
