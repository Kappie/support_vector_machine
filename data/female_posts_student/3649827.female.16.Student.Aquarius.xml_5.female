Interpol is pretty moody, isn't it? but it suits me. it was raining like hell today. it was nice. storms are awesome.  and of course what did i think about driving through it? you got it. i'm so pathetic. i need it. i need something. i need more than one thing i think. what has this got to? and i don't think it's bad at all. i need a good fix.  a fix. haha. make of it what you will.
