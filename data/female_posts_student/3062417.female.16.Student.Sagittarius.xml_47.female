So after I got my score I talked to Pat for a couple of minutes and then I left Remsen (I don't ever want to go back). Then I went and rented some movies and then picked up my prom pictures! They are all so prettyful!  So, right now I'm listening to HIM and that's it because I have a boring, boring life. I hate the people that wear Bam shirts and try to be just like him. This is what I have to say to them: I hate you. Get your own life. He isn't that great of a person. Stop copying everything he or anyone else does. Find who you truely are and stop trying to act "cool" by being a wannabe. Noone will ever respect you unless you are yourself. Well, I could say more but I won't.   Song: Confusion writhes around our hearts impatiently It drains the faith that lights the dark and sets us free From the chains of our war and the pain we once called love The poison of doubt enslaves our minds and we bleed We abandon the trust that kept us blind and disappear Under the crimson wings of hate where the lost are safe Until they love again The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there And that hope will be our love's requiem We pray to the serpent of delight desperately The questions are answered and we try not to weep Until we are sure we're suffering for love In the dungeon of our dreams we're so weak The promise made to be broken still haunts our sleep We won't open our eyes afraid we would die for love again  The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there And that hope will be our love's requiem The salvation we seek will be waiting us there In the heart of darkness lonely and scared With a promise of death for our love And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love I'm lost And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love I'm lost The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there And that hope will be our love's requiem Take me into your arms and sing me your beautiful song Hold me until we're one and sing me you're beautiful song The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there And that hope will be our love's requiem Take me into your arms and sing me your beautiful song Hold me until we're one and sing me you're beautiful song... -Love's Requiem- HIM
