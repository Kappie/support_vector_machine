I dont think ppl want to read our blog coz its boring and only about the lives of a handful of tfsers.  Blogs are made for expressing your thoughts and opinions in the world.  Or your philosophy of life.  Most people like to read blogs like that.  In fact, i was reading a blog and it says and i quote, " Have you guys ever read the other blogs here?  I have.  We sound more like geniuses compared to those people who only complain about their lives.  I dont think there is anyone intelligent enough out there to write a DECENT blog..." I dont think you guys would like to do philosophy but why not take this chance to get to know each other's thoughts and opinions better, hm?  Now why dont you look at my opinion and tell me if you agree or not.  Opinion   What do you guys think will and should be done with Holly Jones' murderer when he/she is caught?   I personally think that this ,guys, is sick. I believe that this monster deserves nothing other than an execution. Who could possibly kill a girl like that? WHAT A COWARD!!!!! I really really hope they get an execution because:   A) they killed a child who hasn't even lived her life yet  B) it's people like them that waste the oxygen in the air and are a waste of blood and flesh in this world  C) there is no excuse for this outrage!  D) All of the Above   Answer: D)   augh! This is so stupid, though! They're probably going to put that person in jail for a year or two and set them free again. YEAH RIGHT!! As if that's gonna teach them a lesson! Blood for blood, death for a death. I believe in that for case of murders and murders only! If you're gonna put them in jail like that, why dont you just give them a stupid lollipop, pat them on the head and tell them they did nothing wrong.
