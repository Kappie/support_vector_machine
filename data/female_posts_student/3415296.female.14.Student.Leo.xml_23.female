I asked why, he said it gave him the feeling to think. Today Alex told me to not even think about Safee. I asked why, he gave me one simple line. He's going out with her. I wasn't that shocked about hearing it. I was expecting it. Just not this soon. I guess time moves fast. Or I'm taking a while to get back to the regular me.   Yesturday I asked him why he wasn't there. He said he waited for a second and didn't see me so he left to walk her home. I didn't complain. I just wish I knew that because I was waiting at school for an hour for him. I thought he was going to come back. I was wrong. Krystal told me to go to her house and call him there. I did, and he wasn't home. He was still walking her home. At the end of our conversation, he had to go and sent me one single line of words, "petals will crumble from this rose and will rot to dust like so has our love washin away from us". I really had an odd reaction. The first thing coming to my mind was,  I rather not have you say that . But he did. I guess he wanted to make it clear.   I'm talking to Ashley and Krystal on MSN. They said I should make him feel bad for what he did. But I don't want to. I would never want to. I just want him to be happy with her. I wanted to tell him everything, about us before, but it's too late now. I wanted to say everything before it happened, but it did. I can't say anything. I can't say what I wanted to. I guess this really is over.   ashwee*_ you never realized how much she loved you   [ o4`=bff] says: if he loved you and you guys broke up, he'll still think abt you.. he cant get over you in one week!  alice - lotr.freak.show.

'oo2 [ o4`=bff ][ 95 - 1053 ][ i really just wish.. ] says: he was alice - lotr.freak.show. 'oo2 [ o4`=bff ][ 95 - 1053 ][ i really just wish.. ] says: he just said it..cuz his mind said he did..but his heart belonged to someone else  That was our conversation. That's how I feel now. However, it doesnt hurt me anymore. Like it before. Now, I'm just me. I'm back to myself, where I didn't love him. I am me.
