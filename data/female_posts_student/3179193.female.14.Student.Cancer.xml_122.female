I don't wanna know If you're playin' me, keep it on the low Cuz my heart can't take it anymore And if you're creepin', please don't let it show Oh baby, I don't wanna know  So sad... sad sad song. :( But so meaningful and stuff. Blah... Downloading it at home. Well I'm off... yes, again. See y'all laters.
