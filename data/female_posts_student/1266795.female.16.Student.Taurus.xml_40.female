But about french since we seem to talk so much about french, I thought i'd give my title the "wonderful" movie that we saw in french about the guy with the secret identity. i think...no i know that i completely failed the french test cuz i couldn't remember how to do plus-que parfait. i'm a failure...btw...no need to stress on that fact...i know well:-p   Summer is here and it's so warm and nice outside...now we can save gas just by opening our windows since gas is also so expensive. School's gonna be over soon and i'm gonna miss y'alls that i only see at school. we must get together and do summer stuff...like go swimming and shop for summer stuff.  i need a tan so bad...i pasty and that means i'm not gonna be wearing shorts for a while. as to answering sarah's question, i love the period key. i dunno why, but i usually use it a lot when i'm trying cuz i love to link my ideas together.  but if the question was more broad, i'd pick all the keys that you'd need to make all those really cute smiley faces. isn't this so cute?:Ãž hehehe BURGLE!!!!!
