OMG, I have so many freaking tests this week and next. ok, why did the teachers assign all this during late night rehearsals week? Are they that freaking EVIL? Yes, they are. Literary Terms test in English on Thursday, as well as a quiz in SAT Prep over verbal words, prefixes, and suffixes, plus a German test, yay! Then on Friday, I have an Algebra 2 test and the Unit 3 test for US History, which I know I'm going to fail, so no use studying. Then next week, I have 2 tests in English, one over Huck Finn (which I'm half through) and out Required Outside Reading (ROR) which I haven't even started! haha...Then a Chemistry test, and that could be it...well at least I won't have probably any homework over the break. :::yawn::: I need to go to bed, but I have uber amounts of homework, I need to finish reading Chapter 17 for History, and then do those German worksheets that will "supposedly help me on the test" and I still have like 5 chapters left to read in Huck Finn by Thursday. And I seriously need to start the Joy Luck Club (my ROR)...I'll give it like till 1, that's how long I was up last night =p!  :::backstage with the "mini fairies" (kids)::: me: "Jimmy this is why we can never get drunk together" :::points at little kids::: jimmy: "We'd just be producing like bunnies...pop pop...." Seriously, me and Jimmy can never get drunk together, lol. ANYWAYS I LOVE MY DAVID TOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-*   "Hey, wait a minute, don't go 'Cause I'm still in love with you"
