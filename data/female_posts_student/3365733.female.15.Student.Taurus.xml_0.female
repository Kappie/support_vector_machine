Went out with Ms Wong. haha. Some girls from school are, dare I say, jealous? =) Too bad. I don't give a damn, seriously. Jealous, so what? It doesn't affect me. Nor Ms Wong. Our consciences are clear. We're doing nothing wrong. Oh yeah. =)  So, yeah, as I was saying, we were just talking about movies... And I realise she watches movies once a week on average. *Hears the gasps from everybody* Yes. One movie. One week. Teacher = Supposed to be very busy, no? Apparently not =D  So, yeah. Both of us were crying ourselves silly during Troy (AGAIN!) and A Walk To Remember. Was at her house, you see. =) We used up like, 3 boxes of tissue? Okay  lah , the first box was almost empty. Hehe. Ohyeahs I was telling her about the shoe thing right after Troy and she burst out laughing. Whahahaha. So comical!  Will be going for the Media Camp from the 3rd to the 5th.. So yeah, bye everybody.. =) Journalism, here I come.. =) Ms Wong's the teacher in charge, yes. With Ms Leong! I'm gonna kachiao them like mad. Whahahaha.  Comments worth noting:  `We had to choose 20 participants for the camp. You were the first name that sprung into our minds.' -- Ms Wong =)  `IT WAS SO DAMN SAD WHEN HE DIED *SOBS*' -- (Yes, caps intended =P) -- Ms Wong  `I've watched The Day After Tomorrow.' `You've watched it? Never ask me go with you...' `I've watched Shrek too. Haha' `Yuck Ms Wong I hate you *=P*'  `How come *sniff* Paris doesn't *sniff* die? He should *sniff* die *sniff* because he's such *sniff* a hum*sniff*ji.' `Because *sniff* the directors were afraid that *sniff* the 10 million Orlando *sniff* fans will charge and murder *sniff* them.'  =D
