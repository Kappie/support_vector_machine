Neither the Republican presidential candidate nor the Democratic presidential candidate had enough votes to win the election. Therefore, it was decided that there should be an ice-fishing contest between the two candidates to determine the final winner. There was much talk about ballot recounting, court challenges, etc., but a week-long ice fishing competition seemed the (manly) way to settle things. The candidate that catches the most fish at the end of the week wins.  After a lot of back and forth discussion, it was decided that the contest would take place on a remote and frozen lake in Minnesota.  There were to be no observers present, and both men were to be sent out separately on this remote lake and return daily with their catch for counting and verification!   At the end of the first day, George W. returns to the starting line and he has 10 fishes.  Soon, Kerry returns and has zero fish.  Well, everyone assumes he is just having another bad hair day or something and hopefully, he will catch up the next day.  At the end of the 2nd day George W. comes in with 20 fishes and Kerry comes in again with none.  That evening, Bill Clinton gets together secretly with Kerry and says, "I think George W. is a lowlife cheatin' son-of-a-gun. I want you to go out tomorrow and don't even bother with fishing.  Just spy on him and see if he is cheating in any way.  The next night (after George W. comes back with 50 fish), Clinton says to Kerry, "Well, what about it, is George W. cheatin'?"  "He sure is, Bill, he's cutting holes in the ice!"
