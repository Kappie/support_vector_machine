One girl insists on showing everyone her new piercing...YA! It's down there!!! She is sort of the leader in that particular sorority house and all the new freshman gurls had to act like it was all ok to look at her and not be embarressed. It's really funny. Then they started talking about how all the houses are starting to have one black girl. They said this in front of the black girl in the house an dall she could really do is just laugh and say, "Yup, that's me!" I really wanted to join a sorority when I got to college, but hearing alot of these things about how they DO have eating disorders is just crazy. They were talking about how the plumber was a frequent visitar because of all the stomach acids that were eroding the pipe lines from there vomit. Or how the lunch ladies noticed hundreds and hundreds of plastic sandwich bags dissappearing, and the plumber would find them in the garbages and toilet pipes of the sorority houses. GrOsS!!!     The bully was a pretty good story. I think it is neat how even though Tony was a bully to Roger in the 7th grade, he still helped him out and gave him his numbers and wanted to do lunch with him. He could have easily been like you use to do that stuff to me in middle school. Like garbage and now that your in theposition for me to make fun of you I think it is funny that your handicap. Or anything along those lines. That was very big of him to put things behind them and not hold anything against him from what happend in 7th grade.
