The deal is you make 50 bucks for every 5 deals you make, as commission, then another 50 bucks as bonus for every 20 deals you make in a week. Thus, since I started working my 5 hours a day, 6 days a week, I have made 300 bones extra. So, with the math, that comes out to $780 for 50 hours of work. (comes out to $15.80/hr.) not bad, i know, for a shitty telemarketing job. okay enough showing off my hot job.  yay the parents are gone! they left this morning early, so i wasn't up to say bye. norm's coming over tonight and we're going to the drive-in. i havn't yet been, i'm excited. I think we'll have sex for the first time together tonight.  we'll see. apparently the drive-in goes till like 1:30 am or something, so maybe we'll be to tired to do anything anyway....is this blog getting to personal? do people really care about my sex life?  There's this guy I work with named Kelphon. He's really cute/obnoxious. Cute probably isn't the best way to describe him. He's very similar to me in that he's a pure social butterfly. I wonder if Norm wasn't around, I'd be interested in him. I know I would. I got him to open up to me yesturday. We discussed who he 'liked' ( I know, that's such an adolescent term) and other follies about sex/love. He's got different taste in music than me. That is one thing that I know doesn't seem that important in a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, but I can't stand a guy who listens to only rap/hip-hop. I'm not saying that I don't listen to that stuff myself, but I really don't that often. Brad listened to that music all the time, and I couldn't stand it. Joel didn't, me and JOel had similar tastes in music actually. Now me and Norm do as well.  Being a preppy rich bitch, people don't expect me to listen to classic rock. My favourite song of all time is Goodbye Stranger by Supertramp. Everyone has a song that when it comes on, your body just comes alive with joy. That song does that for me. Classic rock isn't all I listen to though. A generic get-to-know-you question is "what kind of music do you listen to?" A generic answer is, "a bit of everything." I can honestly say that that is the only answer I could really produce for that question, excluding heavy metal and most hard-core country. Beyonce, Billy Talent, Dave Matthews, Vonda Sheppard, Nora Jones, Led Zepplin, Fiona Apple, the Trews are all favourites, plus random oldies from the 70s and 80s.   John Kerry's  speech last night was terrific. Being a preppy rich bitch/occasionally mistaken for a ditz, people are suprised at how knowledgable and interested I am in politics, particularly American politics. I can't help it, I find it incredibly fascinating and oddly entertaining at the same time. Sure, Canada's had it's share of quality humourous polititians ie, the poor  Stockwell Day , the Jowl-ed  Joe Clark  or the Caricature-looking  Brian Molrouney .   BUT nothing compares to  Bush . I mean common, the guy's a walking, talking joke.  If he wins the election I, along with the majority of sane Canadians will be devastated.  Is anyone actually reading these posts? or am I just talking to myself?
