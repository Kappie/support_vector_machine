In other news, Spring Dance is Friday and from what I hear it's probably going to end up as girls night since apparently the guys in our grade think they're all too cool for us. Haha, jk- we still luv u guys, but if you're one of those guys who are thinkin about skipping- DONT. We'll have fun, I swear.  BAND PEOPLE ARE BACK! Yay! Haha- btw, alison and paula, you know that deep down you agree with what I said today during advisors about "S" .And Im sorry for giving out the info on our views about"M" And for peter and kyle- we were not talking about a chick. But I gotta say... he's hotttt... but then again- I think 75% of the guys on the planet are hott- needless to say that I'm not too picky.   So anyways- Vienna girls piss me off. Especially the damn steroid from soccer yesterday. Jesus christ child- ever heard of a thing called self-restraint?   I'm so excited for summer... 17 days left- no more logo rule... life is good. :)
