Poor Kyle.    Well last night kayla and i went to the mall for dinner and then the play which was "excelent" in the words of Miss Mateja.  Then, today Kayla was sick... so no movie party at Kayla's.  So then Laura and I went BACK to the play, where we kidnapped Kyle, and attempted to kidnap Sean but he had plans... which was okay b/c i still love you anyway Sean.  So Laura and Kyle and I went to IHOP.. ate breakfast (at 10'o clock at night) and then dropped Kyle off at school to pick up his car.  Why didn't he drive his car you ask?  Well you can't be kidnapped and then drive yourself!!!!  And then we found Kyle's car had been painted on!!! which was extreamly mean and very much angered laura and I.  Then I dropped laura off and come home... only 30 min after curfew.. no biggie.  I would comment on the rest of my day except it was very much not a good day... except for seeing the play again which is wonderful.  I laughed, I cried, i screamed for Kyle and Sean, i slapped Josh... it was a good capper for a bad day.    You know what I have noticed.... the people that my "friends" have been the most judgemental about, the ones they mock the most... are the ones that lately... have proved to REALLY be my friends.  Thank you to all my friends from school, I'm sorry if I've ever placed you second to anyone else in past years. :-(  You guys are truely one (or a few) in a million.  And on that lovely note I am off to bed...
