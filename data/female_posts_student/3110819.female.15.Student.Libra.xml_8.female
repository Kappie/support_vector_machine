Quick, painless, uninteresting.  Anyway, I get home, and on the answering machine there was a message that I need to come in ASAP to get more scans done.  So my mom came home and took me, turns out they needed a test with an IV in! (FYI, totally hate needles) The scan took forever, the lady annoyed me, and the stuff in the IV made me feel sick.  Now my arm kills, and I've got a band concert tonight. Fabulous.  Angel last night was pretty good for this season.  Bringing Conner back was hilarious, and I was hoping he'd keep his old memories once he killed that dude.  But I think he didn't.  Unless he did and is faking it.  This shall be interesting.  Although I'm slightly confused on what happened to Gunn, since I missed last week. ??  Okay, I suppose I should probably go and do homework...
