History was awful, what with that horrible, horrible movie we had to watch, but I didn't actually watch it so I'm fine with that too. French wasn't too bad. A few well-loved people, and I'm set for the day. Add to that we were mostly just learning about the French trip next year, and I'm happy as a clam. To quote that Brent kid from  Corner Gas . Love that show!! No canned laughter or anything. Lunch was fun, what with A flipping up C's kilt, and me snoozing in the grass, and everyone throwing peanuts at everyone else... Science was pretty cool too. Wish I was the one who dumped the water all over G. *g* Too bad P missed that. Also Frodo is insanely cute, so that was a plus too. heehee!!   So yes, here I am, sitting in Number 1 Dress, wearing shorts underneath the kilt in case A turns lezzie again, and I'm talking to a guy from the debate. Pretty cool. Also slightly relieved, since T (the guy, not the girl) has totally been ignoring me lol. A few more days like this and I'll delete him off the list. B says he's pretty cool when he talks to her, though, so maybe something will 'blossom' ^^; Because, ya know, he's got seductive eyes.   Congratulations to A for getting her first Brazilian commenter! *falls off chair* LOL!   And I love Maynard. I love him I love him I love him. Except I heard APC is 'going on hiatus' June 13 or something!! Aiee! No! I love them! Even if I kinda like Tool more now. Tool just has the cooler music/lyrics. But anyways. I'm done for now, see ya'll later. And thanks A for posting the lyrics to Tori Amos. The lyrics are nice, anyway. But I like to think I'm not hanging myself from a cross daily.
