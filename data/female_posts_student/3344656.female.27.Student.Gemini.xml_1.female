Rather I've had time to indulge my musical needs.  I've played the guitar for at least 2 hours each day for the past few weeks... I'm finding I'm only thinking of about 8 songs, and needing to look up others in my book for inspiration.  I've also been in the mood for old Ani DiFranco songs (from the first 2 albums) because they're so simple with just her and a guitar, and not that penchant for horns she's had for the past few years.  And I'm ALWAYS startled when I hear "Pictures of You" (Cure, not AD) in a commercial for HP.  But it makes me bust out my Disintegration  album, and sends me back to that place I don't necessarily want to be...  However, in travesty notes, I just today learned that my Disintegration CD is nearly destroyed with skips and scratches of unknown origin.  I think I have to buy a new one.  Of all things, I might be ready to look for an open mic that doesn't necessarily get on you for playing covers for your whole set.  Fantastic lightning show today.
