I heard you guys were at the library yesterday and I think Josh said he saw me. Sadly I didn't see you guys, otherwise I would have stopped by. Hopefully your study group thingy went well and I'll get to meet you all some time soon. I was there picking up some stuff to read for school to take to the beach. Yah I'm going to the beach next week :)  Well I gotta run, I'll post more about myself later Liz. Nice site by the way
