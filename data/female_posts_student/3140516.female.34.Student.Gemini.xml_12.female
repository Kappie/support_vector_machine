I am being very picky about this, because, well, I want to be, quite frankly. I have always been relatively docile about these things, and for some reason this time, I simply don't want to be...I want to be as truly happy in where I live as I am in the direction my life is going, as truly happy as I am with my darling and dammit, I am not going to settle. So, all this pickiness is leading to a LOT of travel time, stuck in a car for hours reaching one destination, then stuck in a car again, looking for something else, then coming all the way back home. I despise having to drive for hours as it is....I prefer to drive because I WANT to, not because I HAVE to...however, I have found a place that I think may be perfect...antique maple woodwork, stained glass windows, absolutely beautiful...going to check with the owner next week... Anyway, I also found a lovely brownstone, and I am also supposed to go back there next week..I had made all the plans for travelling and everything the other night, and said goodnight to my friend and travelling companion(I cannot drive long distances alone, because of my condition), and planned to just kick back. However... I had been having a bad feeling all day, and just couldn't shake it. I knew something was wrong with someone I love, and I couldn't put my finger on it...went to make a sandwich, and suddenly it hit me that I needed to check my cell for a message from my kids, because I had not heard from them in a couple days, and I worry about them when they are in Iowa with their dad. I went to pick up the phone,(mind you, it had not rang), and suddenly I was listening to my daughter sobbing on the other end, begging me to come get her and her brother. I got her calmed down enough to tell me what was wrong, and finally, she spilled out the whole story: Her dad and stepmom had been fighting, screaming at each other ever since the kids had gotten there, and it had finally come to a head; my ex husband was watching a movie in the living room, and his wife was screaming at him to turn it down, he stepped outside for a minute, and she followed him out there and pulled her fist back and belted him one. He had gone back in the house and she got back in his face and he had shoved her, and she ran to the phone in their room and called the cops to have him arrested, telling them that he had cornered her in her bedroom and he was going to shoot her. The cops showed up, saw the mark on his face, saw the marks on her, and arrested BOTH OF THEM for domestic violence against each other...AND ALL THIS HAPPENED IN FRONT OF MY CHILDREN! Now, what would you do? I have physical custody of my children, and he has visitation rights. As far as I am concerned, since he was drunk and making threats(okay, he couldn't have shot her...his guns are at his parents' house and they are locked up and he does not have the key-because he is a drunk and stupid), that shows a lack of responsibility on his part. I did not know the people who my children were about to be sent to spend time with while daddy dearest and the bitch he is married to cooled their heels in jail. So i did the first thing my instincts told me to do: I called my best friend and little brother and asked the two of them to accompany me to get my children. After we got home, I called my attorney(wonderful woman) and told her what had transpired, and she said if he is really dumb enough to go into court and try to charge me with violating his visitation rights, in which case, the court would be told what had transpired that night, and chances that any court in the country would fault me for my actions are slim and none. I was acting in a reasonable manner to protect my children in that I removed them from a house where domestic violence and threats of deadly harm were occurring. I have no doubt in my mind that if my ex had had access to his guns, that that one punch from his wife would have been enough prompting for him to put a bullet in her brain pan. I will not allow my children to be in that type of environment. I left him because of that behavior, and he lied and told me that he was no longer getting drunk and that he was no longer violent. He then whined to me on the phone, and I told him that I think he and his wife both need anger management and therapy to deal with their anger issues and the obvious trouble their marriage is in, or else they need to get the fuck away from each other and stay that way. The only reason I have allowed the children to visit him without reservation until now is that I believed he was being honest with me, and nothing like this had happened before. Now that it has, it will be a cold day in hell before he has unsupervised visitation with the children again. If he wants to see them, he is gonna have to drag his ass up here and see them. He went and pissed off the one person he does not want mad at him again. Stupid fucker. So, anyway, now all my babies are home with me, where they belong, where they are safe and loved and above all, HAPPY.
