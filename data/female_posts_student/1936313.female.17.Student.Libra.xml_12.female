(All semester there hasn't been a single day she hasn't given us homework) and Matt (who sits across from me and is constantly mooching things outta me) all of a sudden asks.. of all the stupid things "Do You think you could push a cow over while it was sleeping?".....dead silence.. then everyone bursts out laughing... It became the debate of the day, somewhat like this:  "Matt I doubt your strong enough to push a cow over." "Yeah Matt, cows are vicious, they'd probably eat you first!" Matt: "You don't know that! I'm going to go push a cow over, come on guys!" Mrs. Knull: "Matthew I can't let you out of this classroom until the bell rings, then you go ahead and find your cow in the city." "Did the cow really jump over the moon?" "Do cows sleep standing up? Maybe you could push one over while its sleeping." "No, cows sleep lying down." "Matt could push over a baby cow." "Matt are you a vegetarian" Matt: "Hell no Beef all the way! I'll push a cow over, I swear I will afterschool." "And get arrested for terrorizing farm animals."  and it.. went on like that for a good half hour... crazy stuff.. crazy day....  AND.. sometime between writing my Trig 2 exam yesterday afterschool and coming to school this morning my graphing calculator went missing. Poof.. Gone. I left it in my locker.. went home.. came back... no calculator. Exams are coming up, one more thing to add to my list of panicky things.  Spanish sub again, sucked. Got no work done. Creative Writing, we... talked all period.. Got no work done. Social, was supposed to be working on prepping for the Essay on Monday... Got no work done. Today was a very productive day.    - -....Sadness is beautiful, loneliness is trying to call so help me, I can't win this war... - -    I'm having a rough night, missing Michael something fierce.... really bad... gotten to the point I'm playing old Backstreet Boys... (SEE? Thats bad..) Michael used to serenade songs from the alblums when we were like... 13 or something... I miss that...     - -....Show me the meaning of being lonely...is this the feeling I need to walk with? Tell me why, I can't be there where you are... theres something missing in my heart...- -      I don't think it helps that I'm supposed to shadow a student at MHC on the 7th.... I feel so completely lost and alone. These are the things they were supposed to be here for... my graduation.... college.... I know its still such a childish wish.. but I want my mommy.... I've forgotten what its like to have her behind me...     - -....There' s nowhere to run.. I have no place to go.. Surrender my heart' body and soul.. How can it be you're asking me to feel the things you never show... You are missing in my heart.. Tell me why I can't be where You are...  Show me the meaning of being lonely.. is this the feeling I need to walk with? Tell me why I can't be there where you are.. there's something missing in my heart.....
