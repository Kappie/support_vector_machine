Or at least I think I saw him. I caught a glipse Across the way And the person I saw had the feel of him But I didn't investigate So I don't know. I was strong. I kept on walking, even though I really wanted to know And carried myself far away Where I couldn't see And stare And wish And cry. And I managed to forget completely about him. Until now.
