F00!   Also theres a new leaflet being brought out telling us what to do in the case of an emergency, one of the things was that if a BioNuclear Weapon is dropped on your head and you get infected and start dying, do not try to go home, you must wait for decontamination, i mean really? Is it that important cos I wanna go put me feet up and watch bigbrother after Osama Bin Fudge Face has just given me leprosy!   Good Lord
