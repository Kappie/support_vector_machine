Well maybe i think hockey is dull, but i agree it can be intense. Especialy the hockey game tonight, Calgary and that other team. Tampa bay? See what do i know about hockey. I really dont care for it much. I think its stupid. And not worth watching. Even those hockey players have passion in it. My mind is set that hockey is stupid.  Hannah
