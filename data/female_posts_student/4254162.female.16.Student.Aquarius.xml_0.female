The life i have now is going to be made up of physics chem econ and trig homework and the one and only P/K EVERY saturday and sunday night.  Okay, i honestly want to know who came up with the original idea of the new shoe rule.  For those of you who dont know we have to wear shoes with closed toes AND closed back aka no clogs.  Thats all i wore!  Its ridiculous that they are paying more attention to our feet then the crappy academics we already have. Last year in my math class when we had a sub come in we were teaching her how to do the problems, and this year she got a job at my school and we'll be attempting to teach me physics.  Oh well...im trying not to focus on that right now...      Last night i went out with janelle and mooney after work, we just drove around and talked for awhile which was nice.  Do you ever have friends where you love them to death but they just rub you the wrong way?  Well, I do, and we talked about it too.  I just dont think they realize what they are saying and how stuck up they sound when they talk.  Its always about them and that drives me absolutely crazy.  I think i might talk to them... i dont know we'll see.  Then janelle went to drop me and aileen off at my car (i left it at P/K) cuz she had to be home at 11 and it then came to my attention that my keys were sitting in the passenger seat of my car...my locked, all windows rolled up and sunroof closed car.  This is the 2nd time ive done that at work.  So we called adam and he came and got us to take us to mooneys car at school and went home got the spare and went back to get it. Fun, let me tell you.        Now im sitting here watching the last minutes of summer tick away...and to top it off i have to go back to work..but i gotta go pick up and get ready...later gator.
