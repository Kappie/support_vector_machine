It is the language that French, Spanish, and Italian stem from. It is also the class that I have right after French, which sucks. Let's see...some examples of Latin would be.... Cogito ergo sum. I think therefore I am Vini, Vidi, Vici. I came I saw I conquered. Ars gratias Artis. Art for the sake of art. (points go to the person who can name where that's from!) Semper fidelis. Always Faithful SPQR...something something que Romae Eh, that's all I can think of that would make sense. Anyways.... Yay for 13.5 hours of sleep! Woohoo! :-D And YouNa, burgle comes from my inablity to use the English language. (Read the first paragraph of my last post. It'll make more sense.) Well, I might post later. By the way YouNa, what's this Festival? I don't understand....  BURGLE!!!
