Everything has just sort of sucked lately, nothing has been going my way, I'm really stressed out over my grades, and life has just been shitty in general. I forced myself out the door this morning because I had a giant presentation to give in health but I was running really late so I got a ride with my mom. On the ride over I remember thinking "Something bloody good better happen today, life owes me that.". The second I set foot on the sidewalk in front of school the late bell rang, I just turned around and stared at the building. Finally I just said "Fuck this." and got right back in the car. Evidently life wasn't going to be nice to me so I was going home. My mom yelled at me for a few minutes but I just grinned at her like a madwoman and eventually we drove back home. She thinks I've gone insane, she is not wrong.  Yet, I think I got my good thing this afternoon. My dad was making me clean motorcycle parts in the backyard. I was sitting out there scrubbing part of an engine case when T walked up. Fuck, just talking to that guy makes me happy. I don't know, I made a total ass of myself again but I'm still happy now. He's just so sweet... Talking to him makes it seem like nothing else really matters. So despite what he may think of me, I owe him a lot for that.
