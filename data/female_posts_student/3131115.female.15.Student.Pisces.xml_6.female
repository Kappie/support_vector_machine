Well, I guess that I'll start from the beginning. I woke up early this morning, and took good care of the Iguanas. I accidently picked up Niblikitosh instead of Tizzy, I felt so bad. Anyhow, after that..I went to Williams house. Things were..good, then horrible...and then great again. KILL BILL -Volume 1- was EXCELLENT! I can't wait to go see KILL BILL -Volume 2- Friday. William is taking me, being the sweetheart that my Booskie is. After the whole \car/ insident...things were spectacular.   Anyhow, I got home and I cleaned the Iguanas cage. I then took out Tizzy, he only struggled for a few minutes before calming down. While holding Tizzy, I found myself desperatly wanting to hold ^Nibby^..and so I did. After spending time with Tizzy, I took out Nibby, after about a minute and a half of TRYING to get him out of his cage. He finally calmed down, and after holding him for a while I started to fall in love. I tried letting him down, not wanting to hold him for too long, because my sister told me that he doesnt like to be held. Being the nice person I am, I was going to let him be. Surprisingly, Nibby didnt want to leave my hand. He stayed right there in my hand, and let me pick him up again. Four times I tried setting him down, and he just wouldnt leave. So after a long time of sitting with him, he fell asleep so I decided to put him to bed. I fell in love. Holding Nibby was a challenge(?)..and now I am able to reach my hand in his tank and pet him without him scurrying away. I know none of this means anything to anyone, but it does to me. See, I love Nibby now..and I am not going to want my sister to take him back. :'(...One more loss in my life. I should have never got attached.   So...today went okay. These iguanas are taking over my life. My mom is even talking about buying me one, if my sister wont give me Nibby. Im very excited...because, this time..It was my mom's idea and not mine. I feel weird, because other than Bill, all I can think about are these iguanas. Beside the fact that right now, I really want Bill to be holding me. Im always scared to go to bed now. He goes to bed so early, and me..being the bastard that I am go to bed late all the damn time.   DAMN YOU BLOG..YOU'RE KEEPING ME AWAKE!   .:I beg you to listen but you refuse  I give you a choice and you wont choose I show you my tears and you laugh walking me onto an unpleasent path:.  Boredom...I want to call William. It's only 9:30..I WANT TO CALL HIM! I want to wake him up and tell him that I love him. That's mean..and selfish. I dont want to do that, well I do..but I wont. Grrr..I need music.   .:I was never good enough to be a permanent part of your life. Even the distance could not have stopped us, *before* but now you have so many better things to do with yourself and it comes down to this.. something you said that would never happen.. I am alone, and without you ~forever~!:.    Going to bed...Sweet Dreams, to -|myself|-
