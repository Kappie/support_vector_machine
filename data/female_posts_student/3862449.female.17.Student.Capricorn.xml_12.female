I learned about how he created a way of sorting through sources of X-rays from star clusters. It was hard for me to understand all of it, because i don't know enough about astronomy. There was not a whole lot for me to do that afternoon so i helped the remote sensing interns to research death valley rocks. We didn' t have much luck. Later that day, Dr. Richmond introduced himself to me and talked to me about his joh and experiences as an astronomer. I learned that there are two branches of astronomy: theoretical and observational. He is an observational astronomer and offered to give me work if i need it (which i do). He said that i can help him use the telescopes to take pictures of variabl stars and evenutally learn to do it myself. This sounds very exciting to me. Helping him with his data collecting of variable stars may eventually come a big project for me this summer. I can't wait.....VOLLEYBALL TODAY!!!!
