I was supposed to get the car registered and get plates today but my mom screwed up the paper work to put the title in our name and now i have to wait like another 3 weeks till we get a new thing to fill out. im so mad i was so ready to drive my car today. so i guess it still has to sit there. in the meantime i can clean it 300 million times. if the window gets a smudge i have to go clean it. kinda paranoid i know but i just wanna be near my car. so now all my friends have red cars. we're gunna be soooooo cool!!! but something really dumb happened and now i might not get a parking pass for school cuz theyre doing a lottery for passes this year cuz some how we went from over 500 spots to 300 don't ask me how and u need all ur paperwork in by the 24th in order to be in the lottery for the first semester and i won't have my license by then so its really stupid and im really really mad...they should do it by gpa theres no way the 600 and somethingth person needs a parking pass theyre a complete idiot. or do it by involvent someone who goes home and sits on their ass all day after school does not need a parking pass...i dunno whatever the whole thing is messed up and once again the school doesn't think of all the situations
