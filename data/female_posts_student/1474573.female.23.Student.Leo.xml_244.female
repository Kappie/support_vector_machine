Got my 6-month review yesterday.  Positive: I'm loved over here, not only by my bosses but by the CEO who, as I hear it, doesnt really like or trust anyone.  So that's all good.  I still have a job.  Negative: I only got a miniscule raise because the company is trying to fix its budget.  A raise is a raise, I know, but I like to feel it in my check, if you know what I mean.  I mean, I like to look at my check with my new raise and go "whoo hoo!" like I did when first got this job and realized that Jersey takes out WAY less taxes than NY... but alas, its only like $40 a paycheck more.  I get another review in November and by then I'll supposedly be taking on more responsibility AND I'll have a BA, man!  YEAH BABY, YEAH!  So I can really talk $$ then.  However, in reality, even if they didnt give me that much then either, I wouldnt leave here.  Although I could be making more in the City or something, I really truly like the people here and the office is so close to home.  It couldnt get better than this.    Something of note... I have to stay over my grandmother's house tonight because my mother, who has been her main caretaker, is off on some Senior Center hike or something near Ithaca, NY.  So I've got 'watch over grandma' duty tonight and my brother and his wife are going there tomorrow night.  My granny has a tendency to think she can do more than she actually can, so she tends to fall a lot and also has trouble breathing at night so someone has to literally sleep in the bed with her.  So, needless to say, I'm extremely anxious right now.    Firstly, I have serious trouble sleeping in a place/bed that's not my own (unless its a hotel and even then the first night is usually uncomfortable).  But in this case, I used to actually live there, and so it causes me even more anxiety than normal.  Strange, right?  Well, I'm not really one to go backwards in life.  I tend to not look back when I leave something.  I am not the type to move back in with the parents if the going gets rough.  That's just not me.  Mainly because I have a strained relationship with my family...   However, my anxiety comes from a different place.  I moved in with my granny and my dad when I couldn't take it anymore at my mom's.  My grandmother does not speak English.  I don't really speak Spanish.  I think the only word she knows in English is "tenk you!" so obviously, it was hard to communicate with her being there.  At the time, I had my dad there as the interpreter and I was taking Spanish in HS.  By the time I left there, I was able to speak Dominican (as opposed to real Spanish, hehe) and we were able to talk.  Moved out, and a few American boyfriends later, I had lost all my Spanish speaking abilities.    When my father passed away, I visited my grandmother less and less.  Part of it was because the house reminded me of my daddy, and part was because of the fact that I couldnt just have a conversation with her.  It was soooo difficult.  Then she started getting sick, and I got anxious about the fact that I couldnt talk to her about how she was feeling and whatnot.  I can't stand to sit in that house for more than a hour.  It's a terrible thing and I'm a terrible granddaughter, I know it.  My sister in law is a better granddaughter than me, but even so, my granny loves the hell outta me and never says one bad thing about me!  I buy her sugarfree Jello and I'm a fuckin' princess!  Go figure.  My Spanish has gotten better, from college classes, and when there's someone else in the house who speaks English, I can have an interpreter if I need one...so things have brightened up a little.  I even try to visit her once a week, even if it's only for a half hour or so...  Well, anyway, I'm still anxious about being there tonight.  I now have to  sleep  in this house ALONE with her.  The grandmother, the house and the neighborhood that does not speak English.  The house that gave me horrible allergies. The same house where a waterbug crawled across my face and traumatized me for life.  A house where my father no longer resides and where my grandmother is dying.  Basically, I feel like no one can truly understand this anxiety and it sucks ass.  Wish me luck.
