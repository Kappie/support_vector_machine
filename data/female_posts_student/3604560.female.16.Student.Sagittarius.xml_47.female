Moving on... yes.. that was a relief... TAMARA... no wonder i couldn't think of it.. its very random. I declare that i am a good driver... "HEY YOU THERE, STOP LAUGHING" *wait until i get out of this room and run over you brains* i went on another drive around the block... it took me half an hour, nevertheless, i made it safely around without killing anything *that wasn't worth killing*.   see you hotties... mwa      urlLink       urlLink                 urlLink
