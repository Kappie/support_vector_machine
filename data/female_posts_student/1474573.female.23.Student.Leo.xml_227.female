I told him that luring 18 yr olds with credit cards and 20% interest is offensive. My 500 dollar debt has turned into 1200 dollars in interest alone. I haven't used a credit card in almost 3 years. I cut them up. In fact they've stopped sending me bills. The LITTLE money that I DO make goes towards paying them off and this one is one THEY just started calling me about. Honestly? I can't even REMEMBER having this card. Yeah Im a financial mess, usually something that I'd be to ashamed about to even mention but then I think about what got me into this mess. ,  I had paid off all my debt before moving to nyc anticipating a cushy job at AOL TIME WARNER well 9/11 killed THAT idea and the only thing I could do while going to school was waitress and bartend,but now I had an apartment and food/bills and I was not about to quit a school I had worked so hard to get into, so  I spent several months basically living on my credit cards. Long gone are the part time jobs with tuition re imbersment, medical and flexible hours. So I've always been semi employed just enough to pay for school and food and I've paid off most of  my bills so when I got this call, it was uncalled for. I'm sick of creditors calling me. I talk to them, tell them my situation and pay them when I get money, but is there no recourse for this kind of harassment? Can they call me up and start yelling at me and berating me?  I'm like FUCK  YOU MOTHERFUCKING ASSHOLE! IM DOING THE BEST I CAN YOU FUCKER! I GET PAID 600 dollars for the WHOLE FUCKING SUMMER!  *sigh..............christ   I'm gonna go watch  Tru-Life I'm a Muay Thai Fighter.
