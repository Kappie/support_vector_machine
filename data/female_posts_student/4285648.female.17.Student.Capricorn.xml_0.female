When i came home from kellie's, my dad was really pissed off that i didnt do the chores i was supposed to do friday, and he yelled at me a lot and lost his temper like he always does. normally i can tune him out pretty good but this time it bothered me just because everything had been going so well since monday (first therapy session). I wonder how much mom told him about what went on during that. Sometimes he's really out of the know.  I got 5 1/2 hours at work tonight, which was good, i can use all the money i can get. Renae asked me to come in a 1/2 hour early b/c Naomi didnt show up for work and she couldnt stay the extra hour. which was fine w/ me except for that she called me at 4:30 and i had to come in at 5 and i still had to do a ton of vacuuming and get ready and stuff. But its cool, i made it on time.  It was me and the boys tonight. I was on ice cream, and Josh, Matt, Andy and Aaron were working. It could really have been a lot worse tho. and i was thinking about it and i remember working a lot of nights with like Esser, Ryan, Simon, and Andy or something like that....basically all the guys that are dicks or at least are dicks when they're with eachother. Those nights blow. But Matt is really nice, and Aaron is just weird even tho he's still nice, and Andy really isnt a dick when he's not around Ted or Simon and Josh is really nice too. Josh and Matt are guys i could see myself being friends with even if i didnt work at the movie theater.  The Ice Cream Parlor was BUSY tonight! It was fun, i really like working nights like that. I even got a couple tips:) I'm gonna ask solomon if we can put out a tip jar;) even tho i'm sure we would get hardly anything, but it was actually a request from a customer! He gave me a 40 cent tip:) big money:P I got to take home some chocolate shake b/c i made 3 of them tonight and kept all the extras, so that added up to quite a bit, i didnt even finish it all.  Being at work really does put me in a good mood, Sharon asked me that monday if i liked being at work and the people i work with and i really do. There was a while there that i wanted to quit really bad and i was really hoping i would get hired at subway, but right now i really wouldnt mind staying there for another year. I enjoy pretty much everyone that works there.  After work I could of gone to Shane Meendering's dance at Children's park but i decided against it and gave Jenni a call and hung out in her dorm for a bit, her roommate is so nice. It made me want to go to college so bad! i cant wait, i could just skip senior year and go to college that would be fine with me.  I just remembered about a dream i had, then this is gonna be the last thing i write about. I got kidnapped by Indians, like Arabian Indians not Native Americans, and they were driving around in my mountaineer and they also kidnapped Eric Miedema but we were in separare vehicles and they let me talk to him on the phone and i was crying and stuff, then they drove me to my house so i could pick up some clothes and stuff and they pulled into my garage and took a nap while i got my stuff together and while i was inside i called the cops. Wasnt that smart of me? i was very proud. Actually i'm not sure that was smart of me, or just stupid of them.  Anyway, i guess i had a lot to say tonight, so i'm signing off....
