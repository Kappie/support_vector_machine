The picks are courtesy of my 'brother' Eric who's been stationed there since...hmm...March? *shrugs* He's a fun kid. But yea, if you thought our spiders were disgusting, you should see these, so be thankful! I think I'm scarred...I'm like Ron...YOU TELL THOSE SPIDERS RON! hehe...come back soon Eric! Kick some Iraqi butt! *I wonder what his job is over there lol...who knows*  Dude...I remember what I wanted to BLOG about earlier. I had a dream yesterday and there were Amish ppl in it. I thought it was quite amusing. Figured I should share that info w/ ya. Also, fun fact. Smicksburg, Pennsylvania, said to be named after my lovely ancestors *not sure if it's true, I have no proof* is an Amish town. Ok, since we're already goin to Disney World, Bryan's house for a riot, and California while singing that song for our road trip next year *YAY!*, we should stop by Smicksburg or at least one Amish town. Then we can pretend that our cell phones are posessed by the devil and tell ppl that if they anger the phones, there will be a plague, and just simply drive the town to madness. It'll be fun...Waddaya say? What a wild imagination, I must say...lol CRACKERS UNITE!
