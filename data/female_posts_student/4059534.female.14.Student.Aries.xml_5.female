Certain people blame me for things I haven't done and take my jokes WAY too seriously.   I mean common! How could, "I wont go to school for the rest of the year because I got into McRobs."   Generate so much anger?    I didn't intend people to get upset and I WAS joking, because failing year 8 wouldn't look very nice on my permanant record. How could people take that seriously? GET OVER IT, IT WAS LAST TUESDAY!      Anyway, All Blacks lost the rugby : (  AGAIN! Bloody useless. Is bloody swearing? I hope not! Oh wellz. All Blacks need a sharp kick up the back side. Because we are going to loose the tri-nations! Not cool.   By the way, vote for the all blacks on my poll and I will send you some money ^^.   Tax deductable to. Nah just jokes....
