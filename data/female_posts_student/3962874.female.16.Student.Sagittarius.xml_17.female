Dad said that we aren't allowed to bother him because he rarely works on anything and he wants him to get as much done as possible. I wanted to put some pictures of random things on my blog page, but I'm not computer saavy so I couldn't really figure it out. Most things I do pretty well with and I think I am better with computers than most people but everything was screwing up with that Hello program and I just wasn't happy with it. I tried looking around for even a new site to put my blogs on but none of them were any good. Stuck here with no pictures. Oh well it's not so bad. Amanda and I are ready to go tubing now all we need to do is find someone to take us! It's not looking to good on our part but I think by 9, we should have a volunteer if we keep begging. They're a bunch of suckers for beggers.
