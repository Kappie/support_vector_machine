( my brothers girlfriend of 3 1/2  YEARS ) and i feel sick.    i had heard my brother talking about her in Mass, but i really didn't think much of it. now i realise the things he was saying, and acting, were a total front to what was actually going on in his mind.    She's breaking up with him, b.c. she's not sure of anything. She doesn't know if she loves him anymore, doesn't know what she wants to do, where she wants to go.    And me being a girl can completely sympathize.    but this was Kristie and my Brother....    it was perfect. they were perfect. They were themselves, he never had to act a different way, do stupid stuff, he never pushed her, he worshipped her. And it was the same with her, she always thought about him first. They did everything together. they bought apartments next to each other, bought a cat together, went on vacations- met the entire families.    fuck, you guys...    with everything else that is fucking with my mind, now i see thatKristie is gone. No one asked me!!! No one even TOLD ME! AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!        i feel like i'm on the rack. I'm being stretched til i can't feel a god damn thing. So many things are happening to me all at once, and im FUCKED b.c. i feel like i can't handle anything anymore.        Alanah is leaving until the day before school starts! i dont even want to try to takethat in right now.        Things are finally starting to go good in one area of my life- well mostly just Gordon    but, i want it to happen.i want something to actually last.        And i have to tell myself that things DONT FUCKING HAPPEN FOR A REASON! sometimes fate just likes to FUCK WITH YOU!! And every other god damn person in this fucked up world as far as that goes!!    AH! you fucking moron!! Ithought i'd never hate you!! why couldn't you just DISAPPEAR!!!! like you were meant to!! you were doing a brilliant job for the past 12 months!!!!!!! until you thought it would be "nice" to chat me up- oh. hey,i wonder what Gena Age 16is doing, lets go FUCK WITH HER MIND! UUUUHHHHH!!! FUCK YOU!!!! i couldn't even stand in the same room as you todaywithout wanting to break something! And you expected me to lookup atyou?! I might'vehityou if you had said one damnword to me.UH!! the more i think about it the more i fucking hate you and i dont know why!!! its just an entire year of...VOID...burning and making me want to bethrow up with revulsion at myself!! GOD!!!!        ah god! and i'm now almost reluctant to go to lafayette.    my brother is coming back but that only means hes leaving!    i dont want my dad to come back b.c. then my mom and dad will be together again and that equals yelling and fighting.
