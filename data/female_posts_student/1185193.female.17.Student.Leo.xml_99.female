The top of the haystack at high school, soon to fall to the bottom of the barrel at some college.  lol...sorry for those lame personifying analogies.  But it's sooo scary.    Then guess what Saturday is?!  My  17th    birthday.  That means I am like one year away from adulthood by number.  On Saturday it will be truly legal for me to read   Seventeen .  It's always seemed so out of reach.  Now it's here.  What am I supposed to do?  When I think about it, 17 isn't that different than 16.  But if you go through your whole life saying that, then someday you'll be 50 saying it isn't that different from 30.    Should I be making different goals for my life now?  What am I supposed to be doing?   Everything around me is changing and I'm just standing here going, "okay..."  I just feel like I'm in a whirlwind right now.     BTW,  isn't   this   new   color   option   cool ?  Thank you Blogger!
