No more school. Just make it stop. I must have slept through every class today. Then I went home and slept some more. And well that wasn't very smart cause now I have homework and it's past nine, and shit. Maybe I should go to bed earlier. Naw. That would just make too much sense, and I don't feel like making sense right now. Or ever.
