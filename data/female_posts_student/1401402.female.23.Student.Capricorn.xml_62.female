I am so fucked up rite now. I've been like this for the last two nights. i feel like puking and i am sooooo fucken dizzy. listening to BABY BOY, baby boy your always on my mind, you feel my fantasy, i think about you all the time, i see you in my dreams. HAHAHA lol, who am i thinking about??? NOBODY!!! i wish that i can just let my self go and pick up anybody from the club that i am attractive to but it is so hard for me to do that. Why Sakdary, Why the fuck cant you just let yourself GOOOOOO. Why do I end up turning every cutie pie away????   Here I am again, sad, depressed, LOnely, feels like crying once more. I am so down rite now. Why no one loves me the way I want them to??? Everyone just seem to take my heart away and run. i need a real lover, not the ones that just comes and go. i am searching for a real love. where is all the guys at??? Its hard to be alone but I love my freedom. but why cant anyone be there for me in need. no one to have sex with, no body want me. what am i doing wrong to make many guys turn their back on me??? everyone is probably laughing at me by now. Probably calling me a BITCH, a HOE, a WHore. I am so tipsy, dizzy, trying to reember things but i think my fucken brain is all fried up.   AT THE CLUB TONIGHT I SAW dEE, he is one of my close friend, pulled me out to the vip room and chat. Told me that his girl Jane is cheating on him with another friend since jr. high. WTF.... at that time i was so fucken Buzz but afterwards the story became very mellow to me. Its so sad to hear about somebody's else probablem. damn i am messing up Big time. do you think I i have enough brain cells and know what the fuck I am writing about??? NOOOOO.  Dee made me promise not to tell anybody about this. Now, another stressful shit for me to think about. I think I should give Jane a call tomorrow but I dont want to get into an argument with anybody. What should I do?? THere isnt anything that i can rally do about it is there? who evers hair it is let them deal with it rite?? but i think that it was kind enough for Dee to tell me his problem. I was fucked up at the moment I couldnt think of anythikng to say to him. Damn, I feel ever wrost now.   At the end of the club i saw Yen, the girl who messed up my sweet relationship. we kept staring at eachother. I swear we was about to get into a fight. My friends had to pull me away and we all left the club. anyone but her. that stupid fucken Scumback. fucken hoe, damn how should i curse at her to make myself feel better??? i should just let it go. its been so fuking long. its history baby. dissy, dissy, dissy, spinning spinning.......  Ouuu, Ouuu, my favorite song is on, shawn paul, i really dont care what people say, i wanna stick to my girl like glue.... hey ya i'm gonna go dance now..ALONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
