Receiving final assessments, getting back into the swing of things, catching up, missing a few, ups, downs, high lows on a merry go round - this week was rather..*thinking of the most suitable word* uncanny? The trials are dawning upon me, and at that thought I am  terrified . But scared in a way where it is healthy. Instead of I frantically stressing upon such 'trials,' I employ those sources of energy through studying  the art of pilates. Thank God for pilates - I believe I am quite the follower. Not Roman Pilateswho reasonedJesus to death hell no. Is that even his name? hahah. I am stressing the significance of another form of pilates - a styleofchinese expression through the use of body movement. It releases endorphines into my system  enhances my ability to move, react  use my time efficiently as well as toning the upper  lower abdomen as well as the powerhouse. Only for the price of$99.99 plus postage  handling. Call 1800PILATE. hahahah silly me.    Through the caricature of I, you will delve into a wondrous trot - ambiguous at times. But honestly real.    hahaha oh shush.    Be back later my homies! TTFN TGIF    --dancing withI in the summmmer rain!--
