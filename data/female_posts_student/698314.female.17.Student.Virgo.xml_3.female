I hung out, outside most of the day by the pool, even though it's not open yet.  I got even more burnt but that's ok. It'll be tan soon.  I also did a ton of laundry, but whatever it needed to be done.  Then I showered up, attempted some physics and went to family dinner at Matt's Nan's.  Good times, I love his little cousins, they're so cute.  Now here I am again, trying to do physics. It sucks and no one understands it! blah! I'm going to bed... maybe I'll update more tomorrow! later
