    
       Say something beautiful David.  Take this for example.  Springtime.  The beautiful season of Life.  The pristine snow drips silently off the blooming branches of a tree.  A time to regrow and renew ourselves by sowing new seeds of Hope.  Animals come to life once more, yawning clumsily.  And, the sky, with its deep blue colour of beauty, its serene face and patience.  Guardian of her children, golden patience and love.
