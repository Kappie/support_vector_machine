And while my account is still active, I haven't been on it much lately. The new "in" thing right now is  Flickr . You all should check it out. All the cool internet people are on it (Ev, Lance Arthur, Jason Kottke and me just to name a few).  Don't you all want to be a part of the newest internet fad thingie?
