"VOCAL"  lessons. ah! $78 per month for 3 months for the basic course. do you think it would be worth it to sign up? everyone thinks it's kinda' er...useless, but i truely love singing. music is my life.  in addition, i have been actively involved in  npcc  at school, because exams are over and i am an NCO (not officially though). i love my life right now. it's so...productive. whenever i am free, i either read, play the guitar, work out or revise my school work. hopefully i will be able to do the same..now that my internet is back.  take care ya'll. *huggles*
