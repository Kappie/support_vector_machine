I love him to death and I don't want to lose him, but...  He told Mande that I don't put enough effort into our friendship, and apparently Hayley was at his house the day he and I were fighting b/c she knew about everything and said something to Heathy about it at work.  Plus she thinks that I've never liked her, which isn't true.  I just never  KNEW  her, and the only thing that I did know about her was that Sam is always talking about her, and that is seems like he's hanging out with her all the time.  And that just makes me feel like shit, b/c I feel like I'm losing him, and I don't want that.  It just doesn't make sense to me how everything could go from the way it was last summer to the way it is now...  And I'm not saying that it isn't partially my fault, but in no way am I willing to take all of the blame.  I mean, I know I haven't called him much, but then again I haven't really called anyone a whole lot.  Beth and I call each other back and forth, so we talk a few times a week, I've talked to Nicole once or twice, Lainie a little bit...  I mean, Sam tried to tell me that he was sick of being the one that called all the time, so he was just going to quit calling.  That doesn't work very well, does it?  Idk...  Maybe I'll call him tomorrow or Sat....   And then there's Ken...  I love him so much, it's just...  I  really  do need that break.  And I don't think he took the letter I wrote him too seriously.  I need to sit down and talk to him, bring it all up again, this time in conversation so I can make sure he grasps the full extent of everything...  It's just... Idk how to tell him...  The whole "Let's just be friends" thing is too cliche, but that's sort of what I'm going for.  I don't want us to be a couple, b/c I need time to be single and grow up and whatnot, but I don't want to totally lose him.  And when I say that I'd like to consider the possibility of us being together in the future I really do mean it, it's not just something I'm saying to try to comfort him or anything...  Am I being selfish throughout all of this?  Is it selfish of me to want to be single, flirt around, maybe date other guys, etc. during the rest of high school, some of college, whatever it is until I feel 'grown up'?  I'm trying to look out for both of us here, b/c I think it'd be better for both of us if we waited for awhile... My parents and family always seem a little... bothered... by the fact that he's 21, and his parents don't like me b/c I'm 17.  I'm still in school, I don't have a job or car, and overall I'm fairly immature and unprepared for commitment.  Ken, on the other hand, has job, car, etc. and is no longer living in the hell that is high school.  He's just got... experience - with life in general - that I don't have yet.  And until I reach a similar point myself I'll always feel slightly inferior to him, which I don't think is a very good quality to have in a relationship.  The thing is, I don't think he'll understand or agree with any of the stuff that I just said...  And I want this whole thing to be mutual, or as close as possible.  I want him to realize why I'm doing this and how it's better for both of us...  Is this too wishful of me?  Am I asking for something I have no chance of getting?  And then there's a few other factors in this...  like us hanging out as friends, and all the stuff that I've gotten from him.  As far as being friends goes... that's what I want, but I know that it's not going to be possible right away.  We can't break up on Friday and expect to hang out as friends that weekend...  That's kind of what happened last time...  I hung out with him WAY too soon, and the whole time we were hanging out I was just flooded with emotions... It was way too overwhelming, and I couldn't hold back my feelings.  I need to be more careful this time... Give myself a chance to get over the attraction and emotional attachment part... Which is going to be hard, and take quite some time, but I think that I can do it.  Maybe...  And as far as all the stuff I've gotten from him... I'm going to tell him to keep the ring in a safe place and save it for later...  I'm giving him back the bracelet... and I'll let him take whatever else he wants, he can make that decision.  I'll probably end up throwing whatever he doesn't take in a box and shoving it in the closet for awhile...  too many memories and emotions at once are a bad thing for me...    So yeah...  I want to bring this all up soon, or I'll lose the.. courage? that I have now...  Tonight maybe, at least bringing it up initially.  We don't have to make our final decision tonight, but I would like to talk about it...  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.... I'm gonna go crazy...
