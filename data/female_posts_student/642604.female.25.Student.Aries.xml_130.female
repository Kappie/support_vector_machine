What are you going to expect them to cancel all their plans just to stay with you?  If they were going to do that they wouldn't be leaving in the first place.  It's stupid, pointless and definitely the result of someone seeing too many romantic comedies in their day.  And so let's say the person is flattered but doesn't feel the same way, there are three ways this scenario can go.  A) The person tells you thank you and that's all they say other than maybe... I'm flattered... and you're left wondering what's really behind that thank you.  B) The person says they love you but they are still moving because who would cancel major plans just because of three little words?  And if they did they would resent you for keeping them from something that might have been a dare to be great scenario or maybe they move anyway and you try the long distance thing but it really doesn't work out.  Or there is C) You tell them and they laugh at you.  Now where in all this did the person doing the professing think they were going to come out on top?  So I can proudly say I've never done this and never will but to all of you out there thinking about it or who have already done it (and I know who you are) stop the next time you think it's a good idea.  Stop before you make a huge mistake.  Because the thing is you may think you'll kick yourself if you don't do it, but you'll be kicking yourself even harder if you do.  Go drink a beer, hang out with those of us who aren't crazy in love and can actually think straight and pass the fuck out because in the morning things will look a lot more clear and you'll be glad you took my advice.
