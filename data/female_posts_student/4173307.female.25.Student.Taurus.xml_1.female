I'll just have to take another one in a month and a half...at least i don't have to wait 3 months or a year!  So anyway, I went to Barnes and Noble last night and I just couldn't push myself to study.  I went to the nursing section and found this really great book for the NCLEX-RN!!  It was just what I was looking for! I skimmed through it and thought it covered exactly what I needed to know!  I hope it will help me pass this time.        I spoke to my fiance last night longer than we usually get to.  I am so happy!!  I love him so much.  Gawd, do I love him!! He is the best!  Everytime i think about him and our future together I get all soft and girlie like...it's like being in love for the very first time.  I get butterflies just thinking about the next time I get to see/touch him.  I have to wait a couple more weeks, and I will be in Washington again!  woo hoo!! I cannot wait.  Oh yeah, we are going to go to Canada this time.  I hope it's cold enough to wear winter clothes.  Well, any place but here is cold to me...im from Florida (i get cold easily)!      Ok, the end.  i am going to the mall now.
