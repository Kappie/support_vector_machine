Thursday I went mud-wrestling (well...sand, rather). That was fun. Yesterday I went to Dallas, and today I woke up too late to go to kickboxing. Suck.  Wow...I  did  have alot to say.  I think it's really odd when guys get all shy and timid and stuff. I mean, I guess it's because approach and confidence are really important to me. I just like it when people are confident, rather than making me feel like I have to make all the moves or something. You know...that's just awkward. So boo to awkwardness.  Yeah, so I really did have more to say. But I think a shower is much more important at the moment.  Thanks and buh-bye, crazies.
