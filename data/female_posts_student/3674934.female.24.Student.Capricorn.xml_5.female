And i can see whay many people become alcoholics  Now as i understand it this blog thing is all about ranting and raving - a soapbox type of thing - well there are so many thigns to whinge and whine about it must be endless.... The issues today that piss me off are Education costing a fortune - the stupid idiots at Liberal - in particular John freakin howard - trying to quash everyone and anyone that isnt white and rich and heterosexual blah blah blah oh yeh and angry drivers whats up with that?? :) HAHA So in future when I get real pissed off I will no doubt REALLY rant   Anyway so should be studying - by the way i just toally cracked my knuckles for the first time in EVER and it was weird. Lovely exam 2moro morning at 9am - yes thats right am - who really functions properly at that time of the morning anyway? Well i guess most of the population who works do. But students mostly dont me thinks. So today saw me head of to the cinema (to see Shrek 2 and I must say it was as good as the first Puss in boots rocks) with my girlfriend who has this weird rule about not studying the day of an exam which i kinda find strange and sensible all in one. After this we head to the foreign uni of Murdoch - which I also find strange - lotsa hippies with no shoes ;) Anyway so im in there been studyin for a while and Im a fidgeter so im flickin my pen about - but this time its a felt tip without the lid on and whammo the black ink comes flyin out onto my..... FACE!! and my study stuff.... SO I have to navigate my way through this rather large library with my head facing the floor and away  from people in general to the toilet to get this crap off my face! Serves me right for playing silly buggers and not studying I spose.
