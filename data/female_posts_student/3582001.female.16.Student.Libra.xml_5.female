It was cool, we stayed up like all night playing "Truth or Dare". Yay, it was fun. Then, when I got home, I slept for about 4 hours, maybe a little more, and then I got ready for the "Senior/Freshman BBQ" at Mellissa Stout's house. I was there for a good 2 hours almost 3. I thought it was really BORING. So I was thinking about calling my mom. And then Jake showed up, so I decided to call my mom. I didn't know what his mood was or what his actions would be, so I didn't want a confrontation. But he ended up being nice to me. Lol. Yep. So now I'm home and reeeaaallly tired. So maybe I'll go to bed.
