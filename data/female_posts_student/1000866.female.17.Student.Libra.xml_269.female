I went out with Chris, and then it ended up being me, Chris, Jim, and this kid Ryan who...I don't know, after what he did to Emily, that's not cool...but, I was still decent to him. He's funny, but I still don't think what he did to Emily was right. We just watched errr, I keep forgetting the name of the movie, but it was funny, and then we watched Ghost ship. Man, the acting was so terrible, but the movie was semi-entertaining. I think I drank too much water today though. Haha. And my back still hates me, and I think I'm just going to go to bed early. Seriously. I'm just going to leave my computer soon. And STAY AWAY FROM IT! ahhhh! OK, I'm done. I'm going to say bye to everyone now. Really....
