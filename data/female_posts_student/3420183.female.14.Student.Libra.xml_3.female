Then next lesson, i went back to my own seat as SUCKY Mr Low sure will ask me to go back to sit my own seat if i sit at Stella seat then Amanda they all told me 'Bu hui la~! Come come!' ZzZz.. The truth is they want to play with me then i no need to study liao.. Haha~ During English lessons, SUCKY Low didn't ask me to go back (so good~).. And yup.. Broke the rule again.. Eating bread in class.. =x Hmm.. After school, went to canteen makan with a lot of girls.. After makan, Lydia and me went to MRLC to find Mr Yap for money.. He gave us $10 and we went to West Mall supermarkets to buy something to make sushi.. Spent about $10 plus.. Haha~ Can lehz.. $10 can buy a lot of sushi things just like the Happy Fish show on channel 8.. Whahaha! =P  After bought, we went to Lydia's house to put those foods we bought.. Then went back to school again.. DAMN HOT while walking sia! >.> Then we faster walk to school.. My face was red hot while going back to class then Miss Tham scolded me.. Damn Miss Tham la! My uniform never tuck in also not purposely.. Just came back and she scolded.. Then Lydia and me laughing~  After tutorial, i was kind of sick.. Not so pain and pain.. Then went home with Lydia..  Keep calling so many times for Lydia.. She called Stella then never pick my calls.. ZzZzz.. Went downstair and supposed want to go her house but when i called one more time, she pick already.. Zzzz.. She went my house because we are making sushi~! ^^ Erm.. First time make foods together with friend at home.. =p And first time making sushi.. When i'm the first one to fold the sushi, she was so happy.. -.-l Then we make 7 different of foods inside the sushi.. Not every sushi is delicious or whatever.. But one thing that i can confirm is there are other sushi outside better than our sushi.. =x  I called Lion to come my house at around 8pm plus and i gave him a container of 10 sushi while Mr Yap, 9 sushi.. I gave Lion isn't what you are thinking.. His mum make the sushi then Lion shared it with me.. Then Lydia and Lion went home together.. Told Lion to see Lydia home first as it's dangerous for a girl to go home alone but then Lion don't listen.. Then Lydia called me and say Lion bullied her.. Zzzz.. Because Lion don't want to go to school with Lydia to give the sushi to Mr Yap.. I don't quite believe Lydia as she say Mr Yap is still in school at this late time.. o.O Mr Yap really at school ma? Don't care.. Then don't know whether Lion got pei Lydia not..  To be continue ...
