There was a misunderstanding that led into a confrontation amongst our group of friends. We try not to judge, but at the same time it's only human nature. I caught myself getting too involved in a situation that really had nothing to do with me. Well, besides the fact that it happened within our group of friends. The situation was basically about "infidelity."   My worst nightmare is that my husband cheats on me. I don't know how I would ever deal with that situation, had I ever had to deal with it. Already, I have had three friends that cheated on their spouses, that I know of. As friends we try not to judge, but at the same time, what does that say about their character. Should their cheating effect our friendship? Does that not have anything to do with our friendship? This is a question that I have been asking myself this past week. People tell me that it shouldn't affect one's friendship. That this is their personal life and that it has nothing to do with me. Why? Why and how does it not affect our friendship. Am I the only person that feels that it should and that it does. Morally, and ethically, it's wrong. I don't agree, not do I condone it, nor do I want to support the. Yes I am there friend, and should support my friends. But, at the same time does that not mean that I support what they did! Hmmm..... You have to wonder, where peoples morals have gone. It's almost a norm in today's society. How has cheating on your spouse become a norm. Why is it not a big deal anymore. One of my friends called me last night. We talked for almost two hours last night about what one or actually two of our friends. She told me that we had no business butting into their business. Eventually, she understood why we did what we did. But I still don't feel too good about having to explain..... Isn't she in a sense "butting in".... Oh well, it's water under the bridge now.. Whatever!  I trust that Mike would never cheat on me. I feel that I know him well enough to know that he would never. Although, that's what I thought about the person in question! I guess you can never be too sure. You just have keep your guard up at all times. I guess you just never know!
