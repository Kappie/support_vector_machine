We make fun of each other for being stupid, for having insane fears, for the people we've been attracted to. I just feel like myself around him.  And I leave you with a funny quote:  With Iraq plunging into chaos and gas prices at record highs President Bush took time out this weekend for a ride on his bicycle, but unfortunately he fell off and sustained cuts to his face and hands. Apparently Bush was distracted by the enormous responsibilities of the presidency. I'm just kidding. He hit some gravel or something." -Craig Kilborn             Oh yeah, Aaron also asked for my phone number...said he would be giving me a call soon...
