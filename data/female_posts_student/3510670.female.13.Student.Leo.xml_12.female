A big man just stood up in front of us that's why we can't make it through the exit of the market..aarrggh.. i was holding my breath for 10 sec. already!! And from the market we just walk going to the Meralco building. Good thing they have an aircondition room. Then, after that trip..(at home) mama got angry at us.. we were like "huh??" kasi naman mali daw..blah! blah! blah!.. Bad Trip!
