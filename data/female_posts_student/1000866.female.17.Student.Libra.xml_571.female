Well, ok...no one else would get the accent but MC so...I'm really just directing this toward her.   Anyway, after that I went to Kath's for a while. Good fun times. We talked a lot.   Being online is lessening my good mood though so...I think I may go. There's only one person I'm talking to who's making me feel good right now but I always feel good when I talk with him. :)
