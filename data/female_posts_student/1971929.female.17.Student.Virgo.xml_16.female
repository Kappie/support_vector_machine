Dear Lord that was horrible. My number one fear is roaches. I nearly had an anxiety attack trying to kill three of them yesterday; Rachel killed the other three. So when the seventh one appeared today, neither of us were up to killing it. I was talking to Ross online and he jokingly volunteered to come over here and kill it, so I took him up on it. I went to his house and picked him up so he could kill it, but when he got here the roach had been scared away be Eeeevil Tristan the Canadian. Stupid Canadian. So I just got Ross to pick up the roach corpses that Rachel and I had taken care of last night. Then Ross and I played video games and I discovered that I should really play more, because I'm not good anymore. Then we played Monopoly, but Ross had to forfeit because he needed to get home. I would have won though.
