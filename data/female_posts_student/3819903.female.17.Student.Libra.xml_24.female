It was a cool game!  Geis pitched a very good game, had a couple 3rd out, strike-outs!  Great game, especially cause they beat Arrowhead...for the second time this season!  Awesome...just plain awesome!    The game was followed by a night at Kevin's House!  Not a bad choice.  Steve Olenchek came over to chill with us, havent seen that boy in a long time, but it was nice to see his always smiling face!  Kate, Kevin, Steve, Sam, Brian and I were chillin' together.  But i couldnt stand a few of um!  Oh well, cant pick and choose your friends!  Cal and Kraus were supposed to come over, but Caleb bailed cause he was sleepy and has a Doubleheader tomorrow.  And Kraus was with the "wife."  enough said! Now I'm planning on what to do tomorrow...hmmm...baseball game, then "anchorman,"  then prolly chillin' like villans!!
