But, my regular blog will still be at www.yozakura.blogspot.com  Soooo. I'm going to post some things that I'm working on here, such as character profiles, the stories that I'm working on, maaps for the particular worlds that I'm "building".  That being the great thing about writing fantasy. Once you get a story or two out, and the basic world principles set up, you get to play.
