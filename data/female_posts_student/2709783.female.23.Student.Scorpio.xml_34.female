Sabrina is really leaving Waco, final as of this Sunday.  I won't wax philosophic about the beginning/ending tensions of different parts of growing up, or losing a friend to geography, or any of that.  I would like to tell a story about what true friends do:  they convince other friends not to waste an evening at George's, which one of us wanted to do, and instead paint a bathroom so as to recapture one's deposit, which is what we actually did.     When Jaimee and I moved into our current digs, there was some pretty hideous wallpaper in the kitchen and both bathrooms.  Jaimee, in all of her artistic talent, not only re-plastered the kitchen, painted it, and added a border, but also repainted her bathroom and made cute designs on the wall with a sponge, something I didn't even know was possible.  One night, after some mild drinking, I decided that I, too, would redecorate my bathroom.  I pulled the wallpaper off, which everyone knows is the fun part, and then decided that I'd rather go to bed.  For the last 12 months I've lived with a trendy, wallpaper-glue look in my bathroom.  Not that it really bothered me.    But Sabrina, a true friend, insisted on fixing the bathroom.  I never knew getting wallpaper glue off could be such a horrid ordeal, but we tried valiantly for a couple of hours last night before going with my original idea--just plaster over it.  Which is now about 25% finished and working pretty well.  I also learned how to put paint on a roller, and about the nuances of rolling paint onto a wall, a skill I will hopefully never put to use again.  Except for tonight, when we finish.   The moral of the story is this:  true friends take an evening and a half out of their final week in Waco to repair what their undecorative friends have done to their bathrooms.  And at the end of the evening (we ran out of paint), I also got my wish:  a cold Shiner at Scruff's, in celebration of Henry David Thoreau's birthday (we were grasping).
