Nothing really new to say but thank you to all the people who have been sending me emails. They sure cheer up my day.    When I have had the time I have been taping Big Brother and Amazing Race, both which are in their fifth seasons. I can't believe I got trapped into that reality-TV trash, but it is pretty amusing to see people at their worst and most manipulative times.    Went rollerblading on Friday in the heat and got heat exhaustion and what I am lead to believe is heat stroke. I am fine now, but when I passed out on my couch when I got home I couldn't move from that place until morning and even the sun hurt my eyes.    Calgary Stampede is over for another year and I must say that this year was no different than any other except that there seemed to be less things to do unless you were wanting to waste your money on the rides. Speaking of rides, I watched a couple of friends go sky-diving last week and have confirmed my ideas of what a land loving person I am :-).  Though when I was watching the Amazing Race they were para-gliding, and that seems like a fun thing to do.....I think it is the whole falling feeling that I get when I think of it makes me scared. I am not afraid of flying per se, it is just the falling which may come with the flying that makes me nauseated.    School begins in a month for me and I am sorta looking forward to that, though it will pass after the first assignments are handed out and I will not be able to wait for the christmas break. I am not planing to go back in the winter semester as it is not necessary for me to and I feel that I have worked my butt off for the last three years so I am taking some much-needed semester off and planing to go and visit some family out in the Eastern Canada direction for some much needed R & R and perhaps get a chance to fulfill my dream and go visit New York City for a few days. I'll know for sure when the time and funds come.    For now I will sign off. I want to watch Monster again, good movie if you haven't seen it.
