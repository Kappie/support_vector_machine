Everything I’m about to say Am I that obvious? And if it’s written on my face I hope it never goes away Yea On a Monday I am waiting By Tuesday I am fading  Into your arms So I can breathe Ohhhh It seems like I can finally Rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhh It’s as if you know me better Than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell Ohhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhh I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me          This song is for he knows who he is......I dont think he knows it but .....i dont think i could ever go out wit anyone else now that ive found the best.
