Today at practice the Bay City Times came and took our pictures which was absolutely retarted. I don't know, they just seem to pick favorites and I really don't like that. I can't make this entry long because I have things to do. So yea, tomorrow is the dreaded kissing scene between me and Tony. I am quite nervous because I just hate stage kisses. Oh well. You gotta do what you gotta do. Well anyway I am going to go, Sara and Sam call.      Love Tami
