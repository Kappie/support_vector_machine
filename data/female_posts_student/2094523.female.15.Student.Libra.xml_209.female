Mayeb we are all more selfish than we know, and maybe we're all in greed. but everything is fucking falling apart. but im not going to beat myself up over it. its not my fucking fault, i always stay in place i never step down from people and friends because the last person i really give a shit about in this lifetime is myself. so if you ever think im at fault, im the one in greed, im the sucky friend, im the one that doesnt give a shit about you.. rethink that. dont put any blame on me because im perfect. im marvellous. im everythign u dont have.... that was my cockiness of the day. take it or leave it sweetheart
