(gross) he also loved the camel ride we took (twice), but perhaps that is because he got the comfortable (for a camel) spot, and i got to sit directly on the hump. i was so freakin' tall, felt like i was towering over everyone. let's see...what else happened at the zoo? oh yeah, in the petting zoo, while i was taking a picture of luke and a pig, a goat took a bite out of my cargo pants, resulting in a hole in my pants. yeah, that was a treat. glad he didn't get my ass. so, we went to the zoo. i spent $55 on one small child. i need to learn to say no.       what else? still dating the new adult. slighlty unsure of how i feel about this person and this situation. he is just so mature, adjusted, normal, stable and nice....it is almost too much for me. sounds silly, huh? he got me roses, it gave me anxiety. this might be a problem. i just think he might be too nice for me. i am not really all that nice of a person...he is. we'll see.       made good money at work last night, which is always a bonus. maybe my car won't get repossessed. or maybe it will. either way.      can a person be too nice? what is my problem? people love to get flowers...how can i not love it too?
