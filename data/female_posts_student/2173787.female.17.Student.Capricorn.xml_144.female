I entirely lost control twice, once making a U-turn at 5 miles an hour and the other by tapping my brakes going 20 mph on the highway.  If you've never slid across two lanes of traffic with no control over your direction, don't try it.  Its really scary, not being certain if you can make it back to your house without killing yourself or someone else.  Everyone else may have had no trouble on the roads, but at 8:30 in knightdale in a tiny civic they weren't manageable.  Wow...Guess I am mortal after all.
