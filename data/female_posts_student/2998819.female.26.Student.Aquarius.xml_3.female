I hopped online to find a race to start training for and after searching for the perfect race, I ran across the O.C. Marathon which is taking place on December 5, 2004.  I haven't paid my tuition fee yet but will in the next couple of weeks.  This blog is all about training for the marathon. Enjoy.  My first 3 mile run was a little tough but I made it.  I ran around a 1.1 mile loop around a lake.  I got to the lake around 745 and the weather was perfect.  It was cool and overcast.  I was passed by a lot of runners, and realized I am very slow.  Oh well I at least I am faster than I was yesterday!     Weight: 176 BMI: 26 Quote: I maybe slow, but I am faster than I was yesterday!
