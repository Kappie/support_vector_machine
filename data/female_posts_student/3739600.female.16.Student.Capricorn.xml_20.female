It's like I can't stand to be without him but that's what I'm doing right now!!! I haven't seen him but twice this summer. It sucks so much. What is happening? I try so hard to make everything work but he's just to busy and for some reason I...awwww forget it! Maybe everyone was right, maybe I should have left him alone. But of course I'm too hard headed to see that. All I listened to was my heart and nothing more. I guess the old saying "love isn't enough" is true. I know that if I go to anyone, all they are going to say is that 'I told you so.' Maybe not in those words exactly but pretty close to it. Man does it's suck to try and change the way you feel...Why the hell do I even care for him so much anyways...I know later on down the road he's going to have to leave weather he wants to or not. So why do I try so hard to hold on, anyways? It's so hard to put into words but all I know is that I care for this guy with all my heart and not being able to see nor speak to him really hurts. Please help me, I have no idea what to do?      Ok, I really think I should move off that topic. It's a really shitty thing to talk about. In other news, my dad is going to to be getting a job soon. An long awaited dream come true for my mom. The only thing is that, he'll have to move to El Paso. I think him leaving will be a good thing for me. I love my dad but we just can't stand each other and space will be a God given gift for the both of us. I just hope all works out according to plan.   Well that's all I have for now. I'll drop in later.   Much love: Brandi*
