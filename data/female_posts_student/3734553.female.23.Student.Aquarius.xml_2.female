I have been in a really good mood for the past few days, and nothing out of the ordinary has happened.  It is great to have those kinds of days, when it is nice outside and you just want to drive around and listen to music with the windows down.  It is like the feeling you would get in high school on Friday afternoons.  Nothing good has happened yet, but your positive it will.  I went shopping for my new apartment yesterday.  There is a huge 4' by 6' mirror I have wanted to get forever that I was finally able to buy. and some other small things like a desk lamp and some shelves.  Although I didn't get much, I feel like what I did get will tie everything together and I am excited to move into my new place with all the windows.  Filled out loan applications all night.  that bites.  I've never had to do anything like that before and it kinda made me nervous.  I was always so impressed with the fact that Evan always seemed understand everything having to do with financial matters.  I feel like I know nothing and dread my second year tax course.  When I was furniture shopping I came across these little black frames with fortunes inside.  I am making some similar ones for friends, but instead of fortunes I will be putting quotes inside that remind me of them or have something to do with their situation.  I am excited about them and spent a while picking out quotes for people tonight.  I'm reading The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.  I picked it up at B after I read the first page.  It is really good.    Still no word from Guinea.  But I'm guessing I will hear something soon, if not from Evy then from Linda.  It has been almost a month and that is the longest I've gone without one of them getting in touch with me.
