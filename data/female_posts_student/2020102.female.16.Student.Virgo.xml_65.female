I heard it once, it said, 'Goodbye'" - Richard Armour   "By starving emotions we become humorless, rigid and stereotyped; by repressing them we become literal, reformatory and holier-than-thou; encouraged, they perfume life; discouraged, they poison it." -Joseph Collins  "A slight touch of friendly malice and amusement towards those we love keeps our affections for them from turning flat." -Logan P. Smith  "The modern definition of 'racist' is someone who is winning an argument with a liberal." -Peter Brimelow  "When you love someone all your saved-up wishes start coming out." -Elizabeth Bowen  "Fantasy love is much better than reality love. Never doing it is very exciting. The most exciting attractions are between two opposites that never meet." -Andy Warhol
