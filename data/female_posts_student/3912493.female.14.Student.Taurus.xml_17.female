My brother bought these tickets to go see two of my favorite bands: The Cure and Interpol. *faints* These other bands are coming, but I don't know who they are so who cares. I hope my dad gives us money to at least buy a shirt or something. A shirt of Interpol...holy sw33ts! So the concert starts at 3 PM and it ends at 11 PM... 8 hours of concert-time! =D w00t!  In other news, Setzer has  once again  attacked ZP. You can go here:  urlLink http://zeldapower.com/forums/index.php?s=2ac658725d7ff47aa20744ab1f67ad84showtopic=9450  to look at the shocking details. What an idiot. I just hope Setzer gets deleted once and for all from ZP. He just keeps ruining it and making it seem like a bad message board. Ack! And so because of him, Rosie and Zix have left. Curse you, Setzer! Well, Zix has not exactly left, but he's not a mod any more and he seemed annoyed by getting modded and demodded over and over again. That's the ZP life for ya. *Ice beams Setzer* Die, garden tool.  Hm nothing much to write today. Probably later on I'll e-mail Mr. W and Ms. Callaway about the crap that's been going on.  _ _;;
