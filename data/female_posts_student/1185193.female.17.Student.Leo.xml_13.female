We're doing our Great Lakes trip again, which is fine by me because that is my favorite part of the country and with the extra money from not going to Hawaii, we are going to get a jet-jacuzzi bath tub and redo our bathroom.  When most people think of Minnesota, South Dakota, Illonois, Wisconsin and Iowa, they usually think How boring! or What's there to see there?  But there are so many wonderful  things.  For example, the Great Mall of America (the biggest mall in the US with a theme park in the middle), visiting the Amish people and eating their cinnamon rolls, driving all day to get to the Powder House Lodge to dine in a beautiful cabin eating buffalo stew by the fireplace, staying in a hotel where the whole first floor is the wildest water park ever and where the room has a jacuzzi next to the bed, riding the Ducks, and much MUCH more.  And then there's the best part: RIA.  She is such an amazing woman, even though she is Bobby's ex.  Imagine a long distance relationship between CA and MN--yeah,  you could guess it didn't work.  But we absolutely love her and her family.  I wonder if they'll have that Rock Fest while we're in her hometown of Prior Lake, MN.  Hopefully she won't be in Ireland while we're there!  In conclusion, no Hawaii still equals happiness.  OH, I almost forgot...eating at the Cracker Barrel.  Yum.  This summer I am working at SMT's Vacation Bible Camp.  But instead of just being a youth aide, I have been offered my own classroom!!!!!  I will be the camp counselor, NOT her assistant that does the dirty work.  I am so excited.  I will either have first or second graders.  I get to plan our activities and lead them through the day.  I love working with children and I think this will be a good experience.  It  also prepares me for what I want to do with my life someday--be a first or second grade teacher!  Awesome!  Just for the record, here are a few of my life's goals: Get a BA in liberal arts Get my teaching credential (while I teach in a Catholic school) Buy a new car when I graduate from college Get an apartment when I graduate from college Teach dance at my dance studio during college (I plan to stay local) ...hmm....can't think of anything else right now, but that's a good start, right?  Riiiiight.  Hohum.  That's about it for now.  Except I have to complain about the scorching hot temp.  I sit in a house with no a/c using one of those ghetto, creaky rotating fans for some relief.  An ice cold Jamba Juice sounds good right about now...
