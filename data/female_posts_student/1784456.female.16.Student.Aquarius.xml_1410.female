I hate that, how they have to catch something just because they're cats. Supposedly it's a present, I guess it shows that they care. But sadly I don't think my wardrobe this summer will appreciate a bat purse. *it's tiny* Ok... bat thimble then. Ahh, I really need to go to sleep and... sleep. *I actually read for ages* I'm so sure you didn't need to know that. My handy furniture friend has just told me about Cadbury's latest marketing ploy, putting: "Do not eat if seal is broken" on Cadburys Animal Biscuits. Must be some conspiracy so you have to buy another packet! *Don't worry if you don't get it at first, took me about five minutes* I think I use the word conspiracy too much. Inuendo. There are too many. With the lovely corrupted French Government, and our totally unpopular doesn't-do-what-the-public-wants government, and let us not forget the American elections *sigh* Now weren't they just a bundle of twine? *laughs actually, couldn't be bothered to type it though, trying not ot go to sleep without pressing publish*
