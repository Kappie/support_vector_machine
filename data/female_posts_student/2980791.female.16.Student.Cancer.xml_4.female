Unless Toby is there, and he will be on Friday night. WE hung out on Monday (yesterday). We talked, kissed and we were happy. WEeeEEEee.    Michelles new hair is the fucking best. I wish I could just randomly change things about me. But I'm stuck being boring for the rest of my life. Eww...I kinda remind myself of Sara Plain and Tall. Ya know..from the Simpsons? People know who I AM...but don't really care. Fuck...talking like this is making me unhappy. Fuck the unhappy.  I'm tired and hungry...and fat. Ew, I'm so gross.  JeNkS
