"What am I forgetting?  What huge reading assignment did I miss?  Should I review the reading I did last week that we didn't get to?"   It's always a bit weird coming back into the space that preempted a minor breakdown, too.  But I'm keeping the thought of "what shall I do when I get home?" at bay by reading for tomorrow, drawing it out by blogging and surfing the net during my lunch breaky.  I'm sure something will occur to me by the end of the school day.    But said lusciously empty afternoon was sooo great, I have to say.  Rounded out the paper by 330, leaving nothing, I repeat Nothing, to be done for the rest of the day.  To be sure, a few moments of guilt-induced "Maybe I should give that paper another look over.  Or I could read those 4 new cases I printed out to see if they have a place in it somewhere." thoughts crept up; I burrowed deeper into my over-sized pillow and tucked the new novel a bit tighter to my chest.  The book's cadence really picks up when it actually gets read for a couple hours!  Yay!    But the book I couldn't put down once I started was A Civil Action.  Decided to give it and Ghostwritten equal time, since I had it in spades, and found I couldn't get enough of the legal thriller!  It's sick, I realize.  Even had a few moments of almost-panic reading about the heroic young attorney unable to find his way: "Oh God, don't let that happen to me!" and the sharky older trial veteran training his minions: "Oh God, I can't deal with those people! Do not ask it of me!"  It was so intense.    And in completely unrelated news:     Anybody who is anybody is part of a  urlLink  photo exhibition opening this week in London.    THE London???  On the centenary of his birth, the National Portrait Gallery  WE LOVE THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY!!!  is showing nearly 200 photographs by Cecil Beaton, the gay man who for much of the 20th century was the epitome of sex and style on both sides of the Atlantic.     GO SEX AND STYLE!  GO ATLANTIC!  BOTH SIDES!
