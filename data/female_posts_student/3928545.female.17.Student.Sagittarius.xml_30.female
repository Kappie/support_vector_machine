I like him, I don't know if it's in that "extra special" way. He's completely the type of guy that I would be in to. But I don't think there is  chemistry  between us. I want there to be.  Curtis...he's  "going after me,"  in the words of, friend/ex boyfriend, Josh. If it's true, I don't think I'd have a problem with it one bit. I don't know what it is about this kid. He does  something  to me. (That sounds weird/creepy)  "We talk sometimes and she wrote me an e mail. I think I'll go for it."  Now Curtis, I've liked him since probably the first 1/3 of second semester last year. I  stopped  liking him when he stopped talking to me for some apparently, unknown reason. I wouldn't want that happening again. I saw him the other day. I think I forgot about him until then. Now I'm having a hard time trying to  forget . I really  hope  he "goes after me" as bad as that sounds.  Josh...The  ex boyfriend , who just, in the past 2 weeks, broke up with his girlfriend of oh, probably 7 months. He told me:  "As much as I think Curtis needs a girlfriend, he can't have you" * "Just tell him you like me, [Josh] a lot"  What is this all supposed to  mean , damn it?! (You bet I tried to get it out of him) We broke up. Does that mean he still likes me, or likes the thought of a girl 24/7? We didn't "click" so to speak. Dose he not remember? We  broke up  for reasons. We had good times. Josh is very capricious with girls. lol...it's his personality; he doesn't go without girlfriends for very long. He's looking already; I  know  it, that's how he is. He'll deny it forever.  "I'm going to try really hard to make it without having a girlfriend through homecoming." "Yeah, good luck with that"     ----------------------------------------------------    Oh you, when you look at me, you make me feel so glad. Oh you, when you smile at me, you make me feel so nervous. Cause you're the one I adore-  Ozma
