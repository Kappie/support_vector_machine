I got my hair done red again (with some blonde streaks...photos may be coming later) and afterwards met up with Bill, Jim, Todd and Andrew for a yummy lunch at  urlLink Sundown Saloon .  Back to the apartment for a quick nap and then it was time to start drinking.  My brother made a guest appearance and showed me some interesting things about forestry and then I was set.  My cousin, Melissa (aka Dana, aka Scheisty), showed up and we drank together as well.  Everyone who showed up to the house brought Andrew some beer (so needless to say they're all set with beer for a week or so).  We were even lucky enough to have a  urlLink Twan  sighting.  Saturday was relatively uneventful during the day.  Vicki, Andrew and I watched  urlLink The Game .  I've realized just how annoying it is to watch a movie on regular television.  I missed like huge chunks of the plot and I saw the same three commercials at every commercial break.  Rar.  It sucked.  Anyhow, Saturday evening we headed out to the Island for dinner with Andrew's family.  His brother cooked an AWESOME meal and I was so, so stuffed.  We headed back to Westchester thinking that a bunch of his hockey friends were coming over to drink only to find the apartment deserted.  I'm sure the neighbors were happy that it was acutally quiet there for one night, but whatever.  Rather than sit around and waste the night we decided to take in a movie and headed to the Greenwich movie theatre to see  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  It was a really amazing movie and it far surpassed my expectations.  Well, honestly I don't know that I  had  any expectations going into it, but it was just really incredible and I defintiley reccommend you guys check it out.  I'm definitley going to be going back to see it a second time.    Sunday was Ru's acutal birthday and we went into the city to celebrate and so he could spend his birthday money.  We headed to Toys R Us in Times Square to see what coolness was contained therein.  I ended up picking up a new My Little Pony for myself.  She's very pretty with pink, purple and blue hair.    which is among the newest theme restaurants in Times Square.  The food was acutally really, really good and VERY filling.  Finally it was time for the best part of the day...we went to the  urlLink American Museum of Natural History  to look at the dinosaurs, and it ROCKED.  We also checked out the gems and minerals (yes, I'm a huge nerd, whatever) and browsed the gift shop.  Good times indeed.  We headed home, watched Sopranos and vegged out the rest of the night.  All in all a pretty good weekend if I do say so myself.  Hope you all had as good a time as I did this weekend.
