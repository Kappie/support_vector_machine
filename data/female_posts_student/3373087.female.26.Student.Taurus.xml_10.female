Even when I was the most busy today ordering diagnostics and submitting samples for Georgia, I felt really happy. Today turned out unexpectedly well considering how busy we were. Even as I was walking up the steps to the hospital, I prayed that God would help me seek His approval alone. The morning started out kinda rough and Dr. Rasor was on my case right away about not mentioning the cellulitis to her the night before.  How was I supposed to know that's what it was?!?  I thought it was just serum that had crusted over on the fur... She was nice to me the rest of the day, though, and we actually worked well together.  I talked to DGD today after work.  It was nice to talk to her even more on a "friend" level rather than just talk to her as an older sister (even though that's a blessing too).  We started out talking about how my rotation is going and then a little about B and the tiff we had on Saturday.  Her conclusion was that this was "normal", even though I kinda suspected that already.  The we talked about how Brittney Spears is engaged to a guy she's been dating for only 2 months and how Mary-Kate Olson is in rehab for anorexia.  It would be really nice to visit her when I'm done with my rotation. Why do plane tickets have to cost money?!?  With B and I so busy with our school/work, sometimes I get weary of talking only about that.  But just like B says, that's what we spend 80% of our day doing, so of course we're gonna talk about it.  I see his point, but I'm just looking forward to the time (i.e. later this summer) when we have other things going on in our lives than school.  It's like, we spend all our day there so sometimes I don't want to talk about it when I get home too.  It's not like B is the one to bring it up all the time because I volunteer information about my day at the hospital.  Maybe it's just unavoidable because it's such a big part of our lives right now.  Today B told me that he had a disturbing dream about me leaving him behind. I'm not sure what to make of this.  Whenever I tell him a dream I've had, he always asks me, "Was it good or bad?"  Then I wonder two things, #1: Why would I have a bad dream about him? and #2: How much should I read into these dreams?  As for the second, I didn't really think that dreams meant much because they could be totally random.  Then again, they could manifest our fears too... So when B told me that he had a dream about leaving him behind, I was surprised that I took that so seriously (since I don't take my own dreams about him very seriously).  Is he afraid that I'm going to leave him behind for another guy? Or does that mean that he sees me as unreachable somehow?  He said that he had probably cried in his sleep, which is kind of endearing. If he really is afraid that I'm going to leave him for one reason or another, then that means that he's insecure about how I feel about him.  Maybe I'm not making that clear enough...but I thought he knew.
