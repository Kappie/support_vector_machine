Whenever I have a problem, I obssess on it till the answer comes to me, or I ask my mom what to do.  On TV if someone has a problem, they hatch a plan immediately.  I think I should definitely look into this.  Also, whenever something shady happens, like someone suspects betrayal by another, everyone sniffs around until evidence is discovered.  Then the evidence is offered up and that is that.  That's all.
