(Not sure if that's a good thing...) Yep... been thinking too much again! Some one's hacked at my piece of the jicksaw and now it has no where to fit. :( You know the feeling? ...Um... ok then. Mmm... feeling pretty useless and unworthy at the moment, but hey, I'm me. The mood changing colour ring girl. Yep... what colour... hmm... turqouise? Yeah! Cause I can't spell it and don't know what it's supposed to represent! YEAY! Go rip up some tissues!
