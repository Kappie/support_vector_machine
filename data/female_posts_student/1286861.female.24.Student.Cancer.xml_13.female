It was a nasty fall at the top of the stairs. I had one of those seconds in my head that last forever: I imagined rolling all the way down the staircase and either becoming dead or having to be rushed to the hospital. Of course it is just a sprained foot, but lots more happened in my head and it was really scary. Needless to say my foot hurts like a (you fill in this blank) and my theatre rehearsal this evening was really hard and painful.   Now that I think back, it must not have been too hard because after rehearsal I went to Sharkey's and then to La Rue with Jolly. It was �dollar drink night� at La Rue. I ran into some friends I haven�t seen in a while; Sean, Qumar and Brent. Before that, at Sharkey's, my ex Jonathan happens to show up with his girlfriend. It became one of those "let�s conveniently not see each other so we won�t have to have any awkward conversation" situations. Oh well.  I have had a spot of sunshine in my unemployed car-less existence. His name is  urlLink Sevag.  My connection with Sevag is a really long story�and I am hoping that it will have a great ending. I will keep you informed.  It is almost 2am and I think I will actually be heading off to bed. Traci? Bed? I know it is odd, but get used to it, I have. I love all of you that read this. You know who you are�obviously�because you are reading this.
