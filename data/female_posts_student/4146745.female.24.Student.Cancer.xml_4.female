Well, lets see, last night we had another party. This one was not as entertaining as the one we had last weekend but it was still fun. I only had a few drinks and so did Kimo. Lester is the one who got hammered and he was feeling it this a.m. At about 1:00 I finally went into the pool (no I didn't get thrown in) and then Lester, Tay, Travis, Jessie, Angela and Steve all came in too and we didn't get out of there until anut 3:00. It was so damn cold when you got out but then the pool started to get cold too, but it was still fun. I didn't end up leaving until around 5:00 because I didn't feel right leaving Kimo's brother and cousion there but Travis was really into Jessie. So I donno what will go on with that but we will see.       Today has been mostly a relaxing, lazy kinda day. We are getting some rain, not much, from Hurricane Charley and it is kinda muggy out but no sun. No one is doing anything today anyways so it leaves me to sit here.       Kimo is working today so he can have Tuesday off so we can go to Funtown/Splashtown with the kids and Angela and Steve and her kids and maybe Travis and Jessie if they decide to come.        Kimo also has tomorrow off because Mikayla and Jordan both have a dentist appointment around 11ish in Bath so I donno what to do with Daunte. Jordan is pretty good on his own so maybe I can have him go in by himself and Kimo or I can go in with Mikayla and Daunte can wait in the car or the waiting room. We will see in the a.m. Charlene would always take him too if I needed her too.      Well I guess that I have wrote enough and I have a few more thing to write about so I will try and get back on later and update some more.
