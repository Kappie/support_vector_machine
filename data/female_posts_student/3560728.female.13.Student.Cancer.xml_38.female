I seem to be only able to write some very mediochre melodies, and lyrics and it's frustrating and depressing when you're not very good at the one thing that you really live for. Yeah...I'm depressed. I think I'll blame it on The Catcher In The Rye, which I am very nearly done now. It's a good book, but it's depressing. I find that I feel sorry for just about every character. I don't know why. Half the time Holden Caulfield or whoever he is is like "and it made me kind of feel sorry for him/her in a wierd way." They didn't exactly have to say that. You already feel this wierd pity towards everyone in the book. The part about the prostitute was funny though...anywho...here's some mediochre poetry that I know you're all really excited to read.   Turn Off Your Mind  I wish that I could touch your star spattered face but I am unworthy of You I am Jaded where as you could fly among angels if you wanted to they'd accept you arms outstretched wings caught in flight eyes afire with the hope, and goodness that is oh so charecteristic of the Angel and they'd kiss you goodbye bid you farewell and wish you good luck living in a world among the Jaded but you would never want to fly with them now is not the time you're convinced that you belong here you're so uncorrupted and beautiful I shouldn't even be thinking of you I should cross uot your eyes hide them under a strand of darkness like the teenaged delinquents on T.V. no, I think I'll just turn off my mind for the time being so I can forget about you...
