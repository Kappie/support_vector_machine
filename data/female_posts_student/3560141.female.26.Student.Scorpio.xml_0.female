I'm in some sort of weird mood, where I even got defensive at the beauty salon...the manicurist said, so...besides your eyebrows, do you think you might want to get your nails done...I snapped in my own stupid way, by curtly saying I like them this way, short, and with dirt under them....  Can it be possible to feel much more inclined to see yourself as retarded (no offense) more so than you did as a teenager?  Someone said to me yesterday something which she may have meant as a quippy remark, but it seemed to hit it on the head...as a teenager we think, "we know everything.." in our mid 20's we realize we know nothing about life, politics, IRA's, or our futures, and in our thirties is when it all comes together...in equal and fine balance...  I am too consumed with establishing myself now, to notice world issues, or even plain and common everyday entertainment news, or even be concerned with our own good green earth...when I was given the opportunity to hear it all beforehand from my parents in my teens my ears held up picket signs in silent rebellion, I am hoping my thirties brings complexities which I feel are manageable, and are worth asking my parent's advice on with all the rioting in my ears being over and all....  I'm just uneasy about something, and I don't know what it is???  I wish I could fall asleep really early today, and just wake up happier...
