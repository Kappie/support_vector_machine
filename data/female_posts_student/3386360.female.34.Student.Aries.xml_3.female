Ok first of all he got up late to watch the movie without even thinking maybe just maybe someone else might want to watch something. Then to know he paused it to talk to some female (ugh she's a major pain) when the movie will stop in 5 minutes and we will have to restart it again I told him and he got all defensive with me. I lost it and basically told him when the phones are in his name and he pays for the damn bills then he will have a right to tell me I cant ask who he is talking to until then he better shut up and answer my question before I disconnect the fucking phone and "ground" him from it perm. So much for if I sleep I will not be a b*tch. Though last night I ended up staying awake and everything because I kept hearing Travis and the damn video game and his stupid music. When I would ask him to turn it down he would get defensive and I woudlnt even say a WORD all I would do is walk in and point downward and he jumped me defending himself that it was Joey who had turned up the bass NOT him.. (sigh) He's defensive, I think he is scared and with good reason.     Nothing from AC yet. Almost 3 weeks sense I last heard from him. It's almost the end of the month. Will he show ? Will he be real? I keep going back and re reading the second to last note he sent, He made a reference to it in his last e mail saying that I might have missed something. What coudl I have missed.. Was it a note that he might be late ? Was there something hidden ? I read it several times. THere is only one part in there that had me concerned that was the "death" conversation. The death but not real death... But then why would he promise to be here by June ? No that couldnt be it. He told me he doesnt break promises.      I am going to go do laundry. It never ends. Tonight I'm making steak. Nothing as good as what I could do but it is something. I'm going to bake it so it's more tender, then I'm going to make gravey with mashed potato's and corn. I might mix up some garlic butter and put some on some bread. I dont think we have any salad left due to the taco salad's I made night before last but oh well.    I had a dream last night, it's one I have had now for several days. I dont know how many. Cole is finally here and we are talking. It's his second day here and I ask him if he is for real because I dont see how someone like him could want someone like me. Almost in anger (not real anger but exasperation) he pulls into a mini market and goes in telling me to wait in the car (we were out driving) Then he comes out and we contenue to drive. We drive to a jewlery store and he buys a wedding ring set two bands and an engagment ring. As he slips the ring on my finger he asks me "Now do you believe me". Then we go and he drops me off at a bridal shop (he knows my dream of wanting a real dress for once) and I am instructed to pick out something simple and elegant (but not white with a laugh) he comes back and gets me an hour later and then he takes me to where I always get my hair done. The boys are waiting there and he gets them. I go in and get my nails done and my hair done and when he gets me we stop and get dinner, the boys are with us. I still dont know nothing and after dinner we start driving. I dont know where we are going but we start heading down I-5 away from Washington. He refuses to answer my question and the boys giggle when I ask them. About an hour into the drive he tells me we are going to Vegas. We stop on the way to Vegas to see my sister (who's son died) then we go into vegas and get married. We spend a couple of days there with the kids exploring and checking out things like circus circus and just being silly then we go back to California and visit the rest of the family and I take him to the town where I grew up to say good bye to my past. Then we head back to Washington. It is only when we are heading back to Washington that I wake up. I feel the ring on my finger still. It's a sweet dream. One that leaves me feeling a sense of comfort.     More later when i am more able to write without being silly.
