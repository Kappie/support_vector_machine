What I liked about this movie is that it really tries to look into the actual conflict a person excperience when he or she finds themselves in love with someone else than their husband or wife.  The acting is what makes this movie good, Meryl Streep is sublime as Molly Gilmore and Robert DeNiro does very well in one of his few straight forward romantic lead. The sreenplay is somewhat underwritten, but the actors really sparkle without much more help than their talents.
