I didn't go to dinner as planned, because my mom got stuck in a traffic jam and didn't get home until just a few minutes ago, and it's raining, so....I wasn't sure I wanted to walk from potbelly's to school, and I didn't want to burden anyone by asking for a ride.   Anyway, I think I'll go pass the time by playing yoshi story. Heh.
