I only slept from 12am to 2 forty something because my ear and throat wouldn't let me sleep!  i went to help at the food bank today, but ended up not helping much because gayle was counseling and praying with a friend who was pretty upset.  Gayle actually almost left without  me! She told me she had to go to the food pantry to do some extra work. Well, I'm the main person who helps her, so I figured she needed me to tag along as usual. I went to the room to get ready, and when I came out, she was headed out the door. She thought I was going ot sleep LOL... I had just woken up from and hour and a half nap! ha!  Anyway, like I said, I ended up not really helping her much. We had an over abundance of fried chicke, which a guy in a store next door took for us, so we didn't have to throw it away. Then we loaded off a couple of boxes of food to three other families. The freezers are almost full and we still have almost a full week of food coming in!  I'm not complaining! It's a good thing. It's just hard to keep up sometimes.  Definately better than "not enough", though.
