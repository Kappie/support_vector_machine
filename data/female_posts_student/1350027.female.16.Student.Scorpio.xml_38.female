I was given some antibiotics for my sore throat and under the weather body.  4 hours later, I manage to lose a huge pack of antibiotics. I'll have to march my ass to the doctor's later this evening to get another pack. Turns out I need the antibiotics more than I thought I did with my close encounter with death last night at 3AM. My body decided to forget how to breathe and my lungs decided to compress itself.   Kinda felt like I was a fish that was taken out of the water. Notice how they flap about and how their mouths move when you pull them out from water? Yeah. I was doing the same thing.  Mom came in to check on me hourly.  Basically to see if I were still alive. I kept on falling in and out of sleep.    My optical mouse was being a bitch. I'm back to the old-school rollerball one. I feel so stupid for taking that scroll button for granted. It's so difficult without it.
