Fuck yeah I do, I'm not going sit there in fucking english and get ridiculed just because I met someone over the internet. It's seriously none of their fucking business and I really like their opinion since they've probably been through something similar, yeah fucking right, give me a break, they don't know shit. Good thing Em and Danielle are in my class or else John would of gotten hit with the 5 lb. american lit book, I was so angry I was shaking and see I don't get mad very easily or very often for that matter, so when I do it's BAD. And so I've been pretty much pissed off all day, and I nearly got to beat up Ryan in german! yay he said I could break his nose, I was like wtf, no that's too mean, so I decided to hit the wall instead. OMG I HATE JOHN SO FUCKING MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At least Ms. Williams is cool with it, she helped me calm down a lil bit...   Ready for action, nip it in the butt. We never relaxin’, OutKast is everlastin’
