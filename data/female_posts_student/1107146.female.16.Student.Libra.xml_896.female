The truth fucking blows a lot of times (remember me yesterday, blank stare and opposition to your every words about my dad, true as they were?) and it's hard to swallow, but that's about it.  IF PEOPLE ARE REALLY GOING TO JUDGE YOU OVER WHAT YOU SEE AS THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION, THEN  FUCK THEM  . Sorry guys, you really have to understand:  Whereas some of you have come to an edge and taken a peek over, we have jumped our asses over, landed hard, now we're trying to get back the hell up over and rejoin what the rest of the world would call "normal." Chaos would be a great word right now. That's all the hell it is. It's a big fucking vortex of uncertainty and self-doubt, fear of the outside world and the inside, all that good shit you hear from Faulker and Eliot (if you interpret it right).  So basically, we have the right to be assholes and tell everyone to just blow us. Let's not all forget, and again, sorry to be an asshole, but I  am  a suicide kid, a very swingy bipolar, and I'm not all the hell fixed yet. It wouldn't take all that much to bring me back to the old nightmare called the unit. Life has been pretty docile so far...yar, I caught a lot of shit with Linds, but I coped, I didn't come out broken down again. I don't know if I'll be that lucky again, and, being blatantly honest, I NEVER WANT TO GO BACK, NEVER THE FUCK EVER. I would rather eat my own right arm than go back, so long as I got some oregano and a nice baste. Hell, not even that, so long as I didn't have to go back.  All I'm asking is that you please don't send us back, in effect: acknowledging the hard but entirely factual truth of Lindsey's post.  We don't know anything about this anymore, I'll really tell you that taking a very objective look at the whole situation, the thing has be cojoned with so much fucking melodrama it's since ceased to float. That is a problem. That is not my problem.  I'm glad to hear that you've come to some resolution, Rosie. If it were me, let's just say, I would tell Phil to shut the hell up, his incessant bitching about the way shit should be isn't making anything better. Sorry bud, but that's the fucking way it is. Yelling at someone, being pissed, these things don't help. People NEVER positively respond to anger! You know this on some level as well as I. You'd only respond to it bad if you were codependent, and even then, you'd still secretly hate it.  It really doesn't matter who hurt who, it's fucking over. The horse is fucking dead, stop kicking him. He really doesn't feel it, I promise. If Philip does go off and fuck with someone else, guess what? Fuck 'em. Do you know why? Because if he did, he would be a worthless asshole (and Philip, if you read this, and if you act upon this, you are a fucking worthless asshole, and you know it, otherwise, you're fine). So in that case, utilize my two favorite words and move on.    Fuck him    And that's all. I really can't help Becca, she doesn't want to be helped yet, and truly, I don't want to try with someone that doesn't want it. I can't help you because there's nothing you need, and nothing I can give you. I can't batten down your qualms, and it really doesn't matter what I say, you know. It's just your ability to grasp the tangible and the real has ceased to exist, therefore, nothing I say will reek of valid like it usually does. And really, I couldn't anyway, because that would require me to understand, and really, I'm too MOTHERFUCKING TIRED to understand much besides depressed people (Linds, my mom and dad, most of the rest of my family), which makes sense cuz I've been there, and manic people, which is no one but me, and even then, I rarely understand it, I just endulge it. It's the only buttfucking time I want to move to any great extent. FUCK BIPOLAR, TIS BRINGING THE GAY. It's going to make me fat, and I'm going to be pissed.  so really, that's it. i'm tired of pressing shift, so i just quit capitalizing. har har. if it really matters, i'll go back and fix it later. but really, just fuck it all man. i hope you find it in yourself to really not worry about this, i can tell that you don't, no matter how much you try. a lie never helped anybody, especially one to yourself. go look up the "serenity prayer," you may already know it, but it would be really helpful if you don't, and if you do, you would do well to remember it.  Linds, aye. Lordy, I wouldn't wish trileptol, and effectively bipolar, on anybody, especially you. It really brings one to be learnedly helpless. You get good, then you get bad, and it never fucking ends. You figure out that whatever you do, you're going to come back down, and it sucks. It also helps to be up so damn late like this :) It's time to start.  I love you all, but some of you are making me pretty fucking batty :) (all of my heartfelt on that last sentence)  And Linds, remind me to delete this too. I probably should. I read yours and just nodded in agreement. I more laughed because I'm really getting a kick out of this whole "I'm going to eat your soul, mafucka!!" bitchy phase. It's about damn time! The more people you own, the better you feel, so let's have assholes for every meal. Yar, it's really late and I'm really tired. Peace.
