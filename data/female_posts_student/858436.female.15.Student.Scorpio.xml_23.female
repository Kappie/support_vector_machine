No surveys for at least 3 days.  I've been staying up so late every night! I love staying up late, but everyone is no fun and they all go to bed, leaving me all alone on MSN. What's up with sleep anyway?  Because of the time right now, it's Christmas Eve! Yeah! I love Christmas so much. Not just because of the gifts and stuff, but just because of the whole feeling you get leading up to it. You look forward to it for months. It's kind of sad the day after Christmas. Nothing too look forward too except boring old January. At least you have New Year's, though.  I GOT MY PERMIT!!! Yes, Madeline Grace Story is now going to be driving on the roads, so watch out! I went to the armory today and took the test. The guy graded it right in front of me, so I saw that I missed 5. I didn't miss any on the vision or sign tests. I'm so happy! So tonight I wanted to just drive around, so my mom said fine if we go to the grocery. So after getting in there (and jumping the curb, yikes) she made me go in and get all the stuff. I felt like Kevin McCallister off of "Home Alone" being all young and shopping for groceries. Haha. So then we drove around a bit and went by Sarah's house and honked the horn.  My New Year's Resolutions:  1. Be more outgoing - I don't people to think I'm some bitch that hates everyone, so I'm going to start saying hi to people more and just being more outgoing. 2. Study more - Enough said. 3. Stop procrastinating so much - Enough said. 4. Have more fun - I have an old soul, and I need to act younger.
