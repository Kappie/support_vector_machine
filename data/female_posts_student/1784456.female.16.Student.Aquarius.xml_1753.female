Or my friends are gonna use our tickets *muhahaaa* Don't worry, it's only £20 commisssion. :P Heeey but it wasn't our fault! The 'thanks you've payed, go get some sleep' page didn't come up! We could've ended up with about 20 tickets at the rate we were trying to get them! Never mind, what matters is that I'M GOING TO GLASTONBURY! And damnit, I'm gonna look normal for once! Yeeeay!!!!
