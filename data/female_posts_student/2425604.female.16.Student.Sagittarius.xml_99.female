Midweek you'll be back to your old self and maybe a little more socially oriented. Try to reach out to someone you don't know well but would like to learn more about -- people will be more receptive to your charm. The weekend will be slow-going for you, but not frustrating. You'll feel lazy and the pace should suit you fine. Energy picks up Sunday, and might take you by surprise if you don't have activities planned.     my weekly horoscope ... interesting ... you should of read my like romantic one ... most depressing ... it was like youll start trying to find a new love ... i dont think im ready for that ... lol im just so dumb ... im totally dwelling over some dumb shit lately ...
