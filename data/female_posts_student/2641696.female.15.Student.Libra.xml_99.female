It will be terribly fun, and I will undoubtedly buy lots of pretty things, but I have to say... I'm not looking forward to being in a car for 11 hours. I could barely stand it in a coach for that long *g*   There's a big white stain in my suitcase. I'm thinking someone had a big spill of shampoo a while ago. Shame on them, who ruined my suitcase!!! *shakes fist* Aw damn... I'm talking/writing/typing like T now... *sigh* Whatever.   Blah. I don't really have much to say. Except NH was pretty grateful for my booksite-list. And also I like apples now. I've had at least one apple a day for the past week. I'm revelling in my bracelessness, I think... *g* Looks like no doctor for me! *cheers*   Just to let everyone know: I have a copy of The Princess Bride. Anybody who wants to read it (because it is sooo good!!) is free to ask me for it =D But first come first serve!! So hurry! Hurry, I tell you, hurry!!!!
