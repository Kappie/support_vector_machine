Just got home from the big wedding weekend and each day had its own wonders and terrors.  Here's a brief sampling of the trip:  Friday night:  Maiden trip to the Emerald Club where I people-watched, accidentally avoided a fateful phone call, met three dykes and Emmett from QAF (actually, he's like 78% Emmett, 17% Ben and 5% Michael).    Saturday:  wedding was beautiful; cousin Rob asked about my tattoo back at his sister's place, where I immediately clammed up and shot him "Shut the fuck up" vibes; Aunt Becky (his mother) suddenly noticed the very same tattoo a matter of hours later; cut to few more hours later and a vanilla-rum-and-coke-induced conversation with cousin Heather's (Rob's sister) hot husband Michel:    "You have a tattoo?"  "Yes, I do."  "Can I see it?"  ......  "How's  that  going for you?"  "Everybody knows, don't they?"  ....  "Well....yea.  How are your parents with it?"  "They struggle, but they're okay."  Cue huge hug.  "I think you're very brave and I'm proud of you."  Cut to Cousin Rob:  "Does your tattoo have a symbolic meaning?"  Long pause.   Will this never end??   "You can just say 'yes'."  "Yes."  "I didn't mean to embarrass you at the house earlier..."  "I know, Rob."  "You don't have to worry about us."  Cue another huge hug.  Cut to Rob's wonderful wife Trish:  "Come outside and smoke with me..."   Okay, so...long story short...the cousins know.    Cut to 20 minutes and a nervous breakdown ago:  "Quite a weekend." Mom said when I called to let her know I'd returned safely.  "Yup.  Feeling pretty zapped."  "Party!"  "Speaking of that....the cousins know."  "Oh."  "They asked and I had to tell them."  "Okay."  "I thought about it all the way home and decided it would be better for you to hear it from me than be blindsided by it."  "I'm not worried...if it comes up, it comes up."  "I didn't plan for it to happen this way, and I didn't mean to instigate anything..."  "I know you didn't.  And really, I thought you were being paranoid about wearing long pants to the wedding, but when people kept bringing it up afterward....I think it's been discussed..."  "It has been, and I think this was their way of saying 'We know and it's okay'."  "I think so too.  So don't lose sleep over it.  Hopefully no one will say anything to Grandma and Grandpa.  But if they do, we'll just deal with it and it'll be okay.  I know what to say if anyone says anything to be about it.  It doesn't change who you are, we still love you, we're still proud of you, you're still doing great things, we're just going to deal with it because there's no other choice."  Cue crying session number infinity.  "You didn't think I was this far along, did you?"  "I knew you'd get there eventually, I just didn't know when eventually would come."  "Well, I am.  All that worrying for nothing..."  "I don't know what to say."    And I still don't.  So I'm going to take a shower, have some dinner, and process the last three days before I sit down to write the whole story (oh yes, there's more...).  Stay tuned.
