There's a reason for this-- namely I've developed the superstition that every time I write regularly in these things, bad things start happening in my life in order to provide me with more interesting information to rant on about. Given that certain parts of the two months since the last entry that have been hell, I do realize that I was just being stupid about that.    Right now, I just need somewhere to mildly explode, since the sources that I usually go to for this either aren't here (Taylor), or have heard it before (Anna). Actually, seeing as it's about Taylor, I really can't dump it on him. Not yet. It's just, he has this friend. I only know her through our shop on Gaia, because he pays her to bump for us. She's what I'm assuming is a fairly wild type. Recently pierced her tongue, has posted frequently about getting wasted and having hangovers, yeah. Last night, there was a party down the street from Taylor's that he went to, and before he left, he told me he wasn't going to do any drinking, since he didn't feel like it, and he knows I really don't approve of it. (I'll get to why in a few paragraphs here.)    Now, right now, he's gone to an Evanescence concert with his sister and I don't know who else, and won't be back until midnight or so. I recently checked the shop, and found this posted by his friend:  "i just woke up from a lovely 4 hour nap.. remnants of hangover are gone. and -insert his username here-, next time we drink, u are sooo pitching in on booze.lol i have limited funds lately"    Don't get me wrong. I love him more than anyone, and there are very, very few things thatbother me about him. This is number one. I just don't understand why he needs to bedrinking. I've always vieweddrinking for the sake of getting drunk as something people did when they needed to escape, or to prove God knows what, that they're popular, fuck if I know. Itdoes a number on my respect for him when I find out these things, especially second-hand like this. I just get these images in my head of him acting like an uncontrolled dumbass and then passing out in some unremembered location, and itreally bothers me. If he needs to act like an uncontrolled dumbass,he can achieve that just as well on a sugar high, and actually remember it the next morning, without side-effects. *sighs and shakes head a bit*    Maybe I'm just being stupid about it, but I can't help that it upsets me. Maybe I haven't been around enough drunk folk to have a fair opinion of how people act. What I do recall ismy friend Brett's cousin Dan leaning all over me and running into tent poles at her mom's wedding two or three summers back when he was drunk.I just...don't see the point in doing that to yourself. It's idiotic. Social drinking is one thing. Getting hammered several timesa month for "fun"is senseless. When he first asked me about how I felt about him drinking, I told him itwas all right so long as he didn't drive anywhere after, as I was under the assumption it was something that happened maybe twice a year. Goddess only knows howoften he actually does it, now, given what I've recently learned.     At some point, I might actually let him know all this. I guess the simple knowledge that I don't like it when he goes drinking isn't enough to get him to think about it. I hate being harsh with him. But it's been proven in the past that the only way to get through to him sometimes is to be blunt. *wanders off, mumbling to herself*
