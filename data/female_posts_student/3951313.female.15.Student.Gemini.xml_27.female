If I do, I can get hurt  I know this   But he's so true  So in love with me  As I am with him   But the walls...  I'm not sure I'm ready  to let them down  to expose myself  to give in to vulnerability   But he doesn't want me  Unless I let him in   I'm not sure if I want to   He says I hurt him   I know I did   I never wanted to  So I hurt myself in return  All the pain I caused his heart  I inflicted on my body  So I don't know if my walls  Should come down
