Alright, so maybe I   do   know where this came from...or who it was inspired by...but you'll never know--because I am too afraid of people who know me finding this and figuring out what is really going on inside my head, or my heart for that matter. They just never understand. Ahh, the comfort of having a computer receive my thoughts and feelings about everything! An the confort of anonymity... a certain extent. The other day I found a blog of an upperclassmen at my highschool (eeks!) but I am just stalling now. Here are the lyrics--I wish I could record the song but the sound board is broken on my recording equipment and I am just too lazy to fix it even though I know how. Stalling again! Alright, here are the lyrics...finally:          I don't know what is wrong   I don't know what to say   I hate it when it hurts and the pain just won't go away     I was in love at first   Now I'm just sick of it all   Can't tell you why it hurts to be here all alone     (So)Can't you set me free?   Yourkind wordshurt my ears   I really should have left here years and years ago      (But it's) Too late now   The inevitable strikes   I won't be here much longer   You won't be near much more than one year     (So)Can't you set me free   Oh, you've pain-ridden me   I hate the way is   Yeah, you'rehearing it   I do hate this   Not you   Never you     What day it is tomorrow?   But what is that to me?   Your kind remarks just feed my sorrow   I'll neverknow where it ended between us   You can never be my own   No, not you   Never you    So can't you set me free   I'm in a cage of kindness   Hurt me outright so I don't love you anymore   So I can leave this place   No, not you   Never you   Never you   Never...
