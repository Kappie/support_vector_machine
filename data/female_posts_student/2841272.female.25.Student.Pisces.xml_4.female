As strong as our mutual affection for the show, I disagree with the extent of your praise for Josh Schwartz.  He’s a gifted writer and adaptable producer, but to position him on the verge of Quentin Tarantino, after only 27 episodes seems reckless.  Tarantino didn’t master his craft right out of the gate, he cut his teeth on  Natural Born Killers ,  True Romance  and  Reservoir Dogs  before his brilliance came to fruition in  Pulp Fiction .  An essential element to the uber category both Tarantino and Charlie Kaufman preside is their refusal to rest on their laurels.  With each movie they are constantly pushing themselves as artists.  Schwartz’s age and rookie success bode well that he might, someday, join Tarantino’s rank, but more needs to be seen before that assessment is made.  When this topic began if you’d given me a million guesses as to who’s name you would bring up, I never would have guessed Michael Eisner.  Before I address your points, let me clear up two statements you made in your post.  1.)	 He’s done everything in his power to keep  Fahrenheit 9/11  out of American theaters.   Disney, under Eisner, has agreed to sell the film back to the Bob and Harvey Weinstein, who are free to find another distributor for the film. 2.)	 The reason Eisner doesn’t want the movie released is because it paints his candidate in a bad light.   To my knowledge Eisner has not come out for or against either presidential candidate. Michael Moore has speculated that the reason Eisner is not distributing the film is he fears Jeb Bush will withhold tax breaks for Walt Disney World in Florida as retribution.  Like you I believe  Fahrenheit 9/11  will see the light of day. Taking a page from Mel Gibson’s playbook there’s too much controversy for it to not be released.  I wholeheartedly agree with you that political movies, now more than ever, are needed.  In the late 60’s and early 70’s there seemed to be a cycle in which popular culture affected the political which in turn affected popular culture and so on.  Nowadays in a post 9/11 world led by our divided electorate, our films feel more hermetically sealed from reality than ever.  You stated wonderment at how bad Eisner has been for creativity in the entertainment industry.  I would take the argument a step further, that it’s the enormous, multifaceted media conglomerates with so many operations but only one goal-profits, that has undermined creativity in Hollywood.  Enterprises as large as Disney are so complicated and diverse they have to be run by moneymen.  Eisner and his contemporaries weren’t hired to be creative, they were hired to be CEO’s and as CEO’s they seem to be pretty good for their companies are all making money but our complaint (or at least my complaint) is money men shouldn’t be in charge of creative enterprises, like movies, music and television.  As a political science student I have to shake my head when people complain how low the political discourse has fallen.  As ugly as it gets John Kerry has never challenged President Bush to a duel, as Aaron Burr did to Alexander Hamilton.  Even though political debate hasn’t bottomed out I can’t help but grimace- we’re more advanced than any republic in history and yet our political debate is being argued and shaped by Fox News on the right and Michael Moore on the left.  An avid reader I have an unfortunate weakness for magazines, unfortunate because the state of magazine journalism is so dismal.  Rollingstone, at one time the voice of a generation, died the day they put the Olson Twins on the cover.  Vanity Fair was once a brilliant skewing and celebration of high society and celebrity, but today offers nothing more than banal celebrity puff pieces and untrustworthy agenda driven articles on the government.  Creativity, so alive on TV, is dead in magazines.  Or nearly dead, the one exception being the online magazine The Slate.  Fair, measured, insightful, and intelligent, The Slate is the only place to look for news and commentary.  Like The New Yorker, but interesting, Slate articles should be read for their writing as much as their content.  In fact, the only weakness in The Slate’s independent, original stable of journalists is occasional contributor and VF staple Christopher Hitchens.  I will now cede the floor, smiling that we have creatively expanded the scope of our discussion, for this one topic at least.
