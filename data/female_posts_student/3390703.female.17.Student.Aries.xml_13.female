Then Lani came over and we picked up Karina and went to her house to get money and then to Taco Bell!  Fun times!   Frank and Bob came over while I was gone and I'm sad because I need to see Bob to survive!  It's not healthy to not see him for this long!  Ahhh!  I talked to Alex today ... and he told me that the Bob/prom thing is irrelivant!  That he liked me a lot when he asked me out, but things just weren't working out!  And I agreed, because I know they they weren't working out!  I mean I wish they did, but there is nothing I can do about it now!  I told him that I was sorry for wasting his time, and he told me to not be sorry because he had a lot of fun hanging out with me!  Then he told me that if I ever needed someone to talk to that I should call him!  And umm, I told him that that probably wouldn't be a good idea considering his group thinks I'm satan and wouldn't appreciate me talking to him!  Well, he told me to call him anyways if I ever needed to talk!  What I nice guy!  Tomorrow is Lani and Frank's one year anniversary!  Aww ... how cute!  I'm jealous!  I don't think I could ever handle being with one person that long, but who knows!  Frank said my mind will change when I find the one!  Well, I have found the one for me ... now I just have to make him realize that I'm the one for him!
