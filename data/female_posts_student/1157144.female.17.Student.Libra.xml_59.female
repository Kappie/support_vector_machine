"actividad a - listen and choose. blah blah blah blah blah" and yeah, then i went to math, and for once in my high-school life i can say that i'm confident about that final. i'm really happy, 'cuz this is like the first time i've had a solid A in math since 7th gradish. but yeah, val did good on that final. happy happy joy joy. history is another story...was only a unit test, but still, i'm not too thrilled about it. i didn't get to study for it, but then again, i never study for my history tests, so yeah. we're hoping for a C+ here, peoples!!! ~_^  and yeah, okay, i'm talking too goddamn much, so yeah, laterz
