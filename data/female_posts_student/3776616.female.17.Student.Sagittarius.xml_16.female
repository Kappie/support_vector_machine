Things were fine for pretty much the whole night - we just played cards and shit - but then I walked with him out to his car. Oiy... I just... had a huge urge to kiss him, and he kissed me back, so it all seemed ok. But then afterwards it was really awkward, and I just wanted to cry... It's not fair. I still love him so much I can't stand it. I miss him when I'm not around him, and even when I am with him I miss being able to be close to him w/o part of me thinking that I shouldn't be doing that. It's not fair... Why does this have to be so hard? After the kiss we sat in his car and talked for a few minutes... neither of us really said much... this is thegeneral idea of it:    *silence*  Ken: So what do you want to do?  Me: *pause* I don't know... I'm really confused  *long silence*  Ken: Maybe we should try casual dating. More of the playing card games and stuff. We'll put the ring and the bracelet aside. And if you want to date other people, I have to let you. *pause* Because I know that's part of what this is, you want to experience other people.  Me: *pause* I don't know... maybe.  Ken: Will you think about about it?  Me: Yeah.  Ken: Ok. I'll call you tomorrow.    Then I got out of the car and barely made it into the house before I started crying, which was absolutely fabulous... Ken forgot his phone andwhen he came back to get it I think it took me at least 2 mins to answer the door b/c I tried pretty much successfully to stop crying. Then I got ready for bed and stared at the wall thinking for an hour before I fell asleep... I don't really know what to do. I don't know ifthe casual dating thing will work out. It's just... Idk. I'm afraid that I'll get too involved and it won't stay casual. And I really do think I need this break. As much as I love Ken and have no idea what I'd do if I lost him, I think I need to be single for awhile at least. I want to stay friends with Ken though, which is the really hard part... Every time I'm around him I just want to cuddle and kiss him and just... be happy, I guess. And I know it's somewhat the same for him, at least on some level. And all of this makes being 'just friends' extremely difficult. Oiy... I think that the only way we can make this work is to try to distance ourselves in some way. Not by not seeing each other, b/c I don't think I could handle that, but... maybe just hang out in groups, at least for awhile. If there's other people there then all of my attention won't be focused on just him. I hope... Maybe us both going on vacation is a good thing. He's leaving for Pennsylvania on Sat and won't come back until the day I leave for Florida, so we'll have 2 weeks of not seeing each other, and probablynot muchtalking to each other. Maybe that will help in some way... And then when we're both back we can just hang out during group things for awhile... And then school will start so my mind will be occupied a lot more so it'll be easier for me to think about him less often. And then hopefully we'll both get to a point where we can hang out just the two of us w/o everything being awkward. There's so many 'if's in that though... And I don't know how he feels about any of it b/c most of it just came to my head last night or this morning. *sigh* Idk what I'm going to do... I guess I'll talk to him tonight or tomorrow night, see how he feels about all of this. We can discuss the casual dating thing too, but I just don't know how well that would work out... ARGH!
