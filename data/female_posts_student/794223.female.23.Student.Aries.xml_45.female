Except, I have to take a final next week, and my actual degree won't be mailed to me until early February.  Oh well.  For all intents and purposes, I'm finally done with the undergraduate scene.  The ceremony was nice...and crazy at the same time.  KINKY FRIEDMAN was our guest speaker!  It was most definitely a break from the norm of speaches.  He was hilarious!  Only in Austin, TX would you have something like that at a graduation.  My proudest moment during the ceremony: when the Dean of Liberal Arts said, "I would like to congratulate and present to you...the Class of 2003." :-D Yay for graduating in 3 years!!!  I can't believe that this chapter of my life is pretty much over.  This morning I woke up completely overwhelmed and a bit sad, partially due to nostolgia and mostly due to the fact that many, many of my dearest friends couldn't make it to the ceremony.  I know that it came at a rather terrible time of the year, and that sometimes you can't avoid conflicts in schedule.  But my cousin Brandi, for example--she works full time as a teacher of 21 fourth-grade kids in Bryan, and she managed to take half a day off and drive all the way down here.  I know everyone wanted to be there that couldn't.  It just sucks when like 2 people showed up.  Probably because I know that I would have gone out of my way to go to anyone else's graduation.  Unless I am out of the country or somebody has died, you KNOW I'm going to be there.  But alas, there's no use dwelling on it.  This won't be my last college graduation.  I still have two more to go!  (Masters and a Ph.D. ;-)  It sucks that you have to celebrate graduation by studying.  Blast this final on Wednesday!
