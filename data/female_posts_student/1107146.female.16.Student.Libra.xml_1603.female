And Will's right, I think you're the only one that calls me Zabeth, not to mention that you're probably the only person who's EVER thought of it.  Scott:  GREAT to hear from you.  I love meeting new people on the Blog.  You are so high in my book.  So I like flattery.  Sue me.  ;)  Thanks for the comment about the site.  Which, by the way, is my next destination.  Talk to you guys soon!  Daddy Dearest encounter tomorrow...more info to come.  Stay tuned, same Bat-time, same Bat-channel.  ~Z
