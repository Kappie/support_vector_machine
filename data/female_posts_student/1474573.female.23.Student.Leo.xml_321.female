The person that's making the statement or the person on the receiving end?  I'm the one dishing it out (what else is new) and it's seriously killing me.  I feel like a parent who has to let the child 'cry it out' instead of giving them the bo-bo ('binky' to all my white peeps out there) or something.    I want to call but I know I shouldn't.  Or well, more like, I won't.  I  have  to make a statement.  What I worry most about is being misinterpreted.  I want this person to realize that I'm not trying to give the ultimatum of, "I won't talk to you unless you get your shit straight".  What I'm really doing is letting go.  Letting them work it all out, and me being around is too enabling.  I just hope they realize it.  So maybe right now I'm feeling a little guilty, and a little sad, but the frustration of someone fucking up not only their lives but the lives of their family is a much stronger feeling.  So here I am.  Alone on a Saturday afternoon.  Moping.  Not returning their call...  Like I said, I hope they get it... and maybe even decide to make some changes.  My love for them is overwhelming but I know I can't live their life for them, and its not in my nature to be a passive listener, so I'm gone... for now at least...
