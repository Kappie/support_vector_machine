(explained in the following conversation)  rebekah: you have a wrinkly neck, old age is starting to show (he's 17)  arthur (my brother): do i?  rebekah: you have to tranmuguforgifier yourself  arthur: i do?  rebekah: yes  arthur: the word is transmogifier  rebekah: oh i love my family. i went to lunch with my sister today, french has been skipped. after school i went home with my lovely friend, brianne, who says hi. we are at my house. we went to the nutty chocolatier downtown. and we (well i really) checked how much the planet smashers are at the door. so now i have to get heather to come with me to buy tickets ahead of time. later on i have cell, which will suck, but it's either that or church. it's not that bad, i do see wes but normally he only talks to laura so... this blog has turned boring. have an amazing day and smile at the lonely walls.
