I have nothing to do and still bored on this day. Suddenly, something popped in my mind. It made me smile then I realized, you came into my mind. I think about yesterday and our conversation for hours. Siguro nagtaka ka bakit ako tumawag kahapon. Alangang oras at araw. Wala lang. Wala lang akong magawa and my last resort is to use the phone, so I called you. You're shocked and puzzled at the same time but you chose to talk to me. It's been a long time since the last time we talked together like that. For me, it's just an ordinary conversasion of a friend and I hope it means the same to you. Ang linya kong "hay nako," you miss it like the others, don't you? Nasabi ko 'to at napangiti ka at sinabi mo na it's been quite a while since you heard that sweet voice. Well, it's nothing. Don't mke deeper meanings of it. I hope that our friendship last 'cause I wanted to help you. I'm just here to help, so see yah!
