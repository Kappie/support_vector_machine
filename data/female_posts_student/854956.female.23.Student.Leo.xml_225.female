Then next week I just have training on Tuesday... I'm facilitating 2 sessions in the morning... and then Thursday is when me and the family leave to go to Port Aransas.  :-)  We're staying a whole week!  I'm so excited... I really need the vacation... and hopefully I can get enough alone time.  I wanna print out a bunch of guitar chords to songs I like, so that I can play a lot while on vacation... and I also want to try working on some songs that I've been playing.  Just instrumental intrelude type of acoustic stuff.  :-)  It's peaceful... and I'll get to spend some time with Rob and Kathy!  :-D  I'm SUPER excited about that.  And I'll see them 2 weekends in a row, because they're coming for 4th of July, too... we're all going over to Kim and Tim's... and I think I'll stay the night... ya know... Redneck Independence Day celebration... beer and fireworks... just like the other year!  :-)  What else?  Oh, then the weekend after that (2nd in July) I'll be visiting Melissa in A-town!  HOORAY!  Hopefully I'll get to see her this weekend, as well... I need to give her back her bracelet that she left here like, 3 months ago.  And it'll just be nice to see her some... finally making the time to see her regardless of anything else...
