I've decided that for a girl who will major in politics...I rarely talk about politics in my blog. Perhaps I'll make a special one just for politics :) Then anyone who wants to read about my views, etc, which I will try to make unsolicitating, can.  Just so you know...I have NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER EVER ^ 25th power wanted either Bush or Kerry to win the election. I've never been Pro-Bush, Anti-Kerry, Anti-Bush or Pro-Kerry. Never. Until yesterday. But still, I hate advocating my opinion to the masses when I believe everyone is free to make up their own mind, and I HATE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSTANTLY DERAILING THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEIR PARTY IS TOTALLY, AND CONSTANTLY "RIGHT" AND ONLY THEIR POLITICAL CANDIDATE IS WORTHY OF ANY VOTES FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
