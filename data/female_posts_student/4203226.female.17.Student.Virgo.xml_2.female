(lol I'm killing myself laughing here cause I know how stupid it sounds!) But it's true - if you see the replay, we challenged the Brits so well - they'll be shakin' in their booties from now on! SCHINIAS, Greece (CP) - Rowing legend Matthew Pinsent won gold at a fourth consecutive Olympics on Saturday, with the British victory coming at the expense of Canada's world champion four in a thrilling photo finish.  The 33-year-old Pinsent, who wept while God Save the Queen was played during the medals ceremony, will doubtless be knighted for his achievements, as was fellow Brit Steven Redgrave with whom Pinsent rowed in the previous three Summer Games. Redgrave won five Olympic gold during his career.  Canadians Cam Baerg, Tom Herschmiller, Jake Wetzel and Barney Williams gave it their all and  lost  [ LOST! Got silver, you dolts! ]  by a scant 8-100ths of a second .   [ urlLink the full article  with pictures of the rowing team :o D  and the British rowing team - note the spiky haired Brit - he looks like one of the hobbitses!] Don McLean said that 8-100ths of a second is the equivalent to 8 flaps of a hummingbird's wing. EIGHT FLAPS! Man, I need a drink. OF ICED TEA, YOU FREAKS.
