It sort of reminds me of a overused skit where someone is anxiously waiting for the clock to change its time to reflect the time in which they have to leave for the day but every time they look to the clock it has either remained the same time for what seems like hours or it feels like time is going backwards.                   Besides having to deal with my pent up anxiety over wanting to leave work already, my mind keeps on going back to this dream I had. I used to have this dream when I was younger, it always involved me being abducted and then thrown into the Bay. Or having problems with dealing with water, swimming, drowning, oceans, etc. I used to have a book about dreams but I misplaced it when I moved back to my mom’s house. I am sure it is somewhere in storage.                Descriptions taken from   urlLink Dreammoods.com          Water          To see water in your dream, symbolizes your unconscious and your emotional state of mind.

I guess when it all boils down I am having some issues with being overwhelmed by my emotions and it is effecting my life, my subconscious and conscious being.                    Right now as I am thinking about this I am becoming very exhausted, what ever is going on in my mind has obviously emotionally made me tired. I understand a lot of my emotion stress has to do with what is going on with my so called friends (please see the post from yesterday) and the fact that even though I am trying to let go of the bad situation, I am still being brought into something I don’t want to be brought into.                    I just want it all to go away and I don’t know how.                    God I wish there was a way to explain.
