Every once in a while the heavens opened up, but God did bless us with a few mintutes of beauitul sun! Woo woo! Praise God!  Just getting out and spending some down time with my friends helped hugely with my frustration. The best way for me to release is to be surrounded by my brothers and sisters in God. To talk things out and get biblical views on my problem.  Now for the bombshell. Saving Grace is indeed a christian story. Plans in the future lead both Grace and Levi to christ. Woo woo! Amen! Great story ending, don't you think? Or, should it be just the beginning? I know from experience, there really is no life but though Jesus Christ. *Thinks* Aye... Maybe it'll have a sequel!   ambler
