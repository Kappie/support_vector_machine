At dad's, we have a points based chore system. We have to earn 1000 points a day and each job that we do to help around the house is a certain amount of points. For example, doing the dishes and cleaning the whole kitchen is worth 350 points. Alex doesn't really like this system because if he doesn't earn his points for the day, then he doesn't get to go anywhere to hang out with friends or he can't have people over. He is 18 years old but this is dad's way of making us help out if we want to live with him. I think it's a great way of getting people to do chores because then each of us kids earns ourequal amount of points and no one can fight over who did more work. Alex hates doing chores, but then he expects to have friends over to watch movies without helping around the house at all. Dad is just trying to get his life going. He is trying to get him to take responsibility for things.
