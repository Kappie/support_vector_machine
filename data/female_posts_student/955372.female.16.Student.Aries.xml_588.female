At lunch Mr. Clark (i think that's his name) came up to me and he's like "your mom wants you to call her" i'm like "....alriiiight" so i go to the 9-10 office and use the phone and she goes "i just wanted to tell you to have a nice day since i didn't see you this morning" and i'm like "GOOD LORD MOTHER!".... then i pissed myself laughing telling everyone at the table. oh god mother...
