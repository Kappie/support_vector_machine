(snaps to will!) whoo-hoo! the itinerary includes the seattle/red sox game (still don't know what 'ERA' means), downtime with will and jeani, visits to wineries and hopefully beach and kayaking time too. i hope to spend some time in portland - i haven't been in years but remember it as the most wonderful city.     >already, chris and i took in  urlLink bard on the beach 's performance of much ado about nothing. it was pretty good, and kerry sandomirsky as beatrice really stood out. one of the cast members, josh epstein, went to my high school - he was a year below me. it's great to see people from Magee doing so well for themselves.
