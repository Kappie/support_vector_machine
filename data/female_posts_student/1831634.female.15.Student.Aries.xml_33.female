TT-TT     Obsessions=  Jack and Meng, Jack's butt-ugly rabbits, GW, fics, H/Hr, MiroSan, refill index stickers, Jack, Meng's lack of boyfriend, scarves, yarn, knitting      Desires=  a passing grade for biology...  finish bio project, done with quizzes/tests forever, kill all the 9th grade english teachers, kill off al of kai's brain cells except for 2, shoot jack, SWITCH OUT OF MY COMMAPPS CLASS       Your preferred…    Actor=  dead jack     Actress=  dead jack crossdressing as girl     Singer/group=  my band called "dead jack"     Saying=  die, jack, die.  [OMIGOD OMIGOD OH. MY. FREAKING. GOD.  (from lunch today.  =D)]     Color=  this one, whatever it is.  just randomly put in CC3366.  dunno what color.  lol.     Animal=  dolphins.  and dead jack.     Scent=  jack's body rotting.  and cucumber melon.  and sheer freesia.  and sun-ripened raspberry.  and victoria secret's pear glace.     Facial expression=  the one I get that Meng always goes "uh oh" to.  Along with my little-girl high-pitched voice and freaky little laugh.     Feeling=  whatever I'd feel if jack died.  or if jack got together with meng.  =)     Music type=  all - doesn't really matter to me.  as long as it's not schoenberg.  cuz I got problems with him.

SAT.  summer school.  41 more days of commapps.     Wish=  have jack die.  get above 100 on the bio project.     And lastly…one resolution=  resist the urge to kill jack.  no matter how hard it may be.  [well, half of that survey was just rendered pointless with that resolution...]    anyhow.  found out who liked jack, supposedly.  caroline told me before lunch today.  and I really really freaked.  I would not stop saying "OH MY GOD" to kailing.  and I pounded her.  a lot.  literally.  because I was so freaked out.  then I told her who.  then she freaked out.  then deanna felt left out and gave me funny looks.  then I caused kailing to hit her elbow.  I said sorry, but I don't think she believed me.  I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M WORKING WITH HIM.  anyhow.  this morning I woke up and thought I just imagined that whole thing... then I came home after school today and he talked to me and I found out that we WERE working together, after all.  I kept dodging the question of who I'm working with.  I wonder how long I can do it before it leaks.  But then I have no clue WHY I'm dodging the question... it's not like I'm ashamed to be working with him.  [I feel kinda stupid, but that's it.]  But it is a bit awkward.  conversation was so stilted.  then we talked about other stuff and it wasn't so stilted anymore.  our convo: first... beD XTC: wen bio? dilapidatedshack: huh? beD XTC: project dilapidatedshack: yes, I know dilapidatedshack: when what? dilapidatedshack: when to work on it? beD XTC: yes dilapidatedshack: oh dilapidatedshack: tomorrow? beD XTC: no beD XTC: we don't even have a book dilapidatedshack: I do  ++time passes++  dilapidatedshack: any idea for biology? beD XTC: nope beD XTC: not right now beD XTC: no book beD XTC: can't read beD XTC: so yea dilapidatedshack: ... dilapidatedshack: ookay then dilapidatedshack: so when do you want to meet? beD XTC: umm.... beD XTC: last 2 weekends of jan? dilapidatedshack: ...  ++time passes++  dilapidatedshack: are you getting the book, too? beD XTC: yes dilapidatedshack: which chapters are we doing? beD XTC: don t'know dilapidatedshack: can you meet this weekend? dilapidatedshack: to figure out what we're doing? beD XTC: why this one? dilapidatedshack: ...because it's the soonest one? beD XTC: ok beD XTC: but I haven't read the book beD XTC: so I wont know anything dilapidatedshack: I'll bring it dilapidatedshack: and you can glance through it beD XTC: bring it where? dilapidatedshack: wherever we're meeting beD XTC: ok dilapidatedshack: ... dilapidatedshack: where are we meeting? beD XTC: probably ur house beD XTC: this time beD XTC: and my house the next beD XTC: doesn't matter beD XTC: I'm busy reading the hot zone beD XTC: =) dilapidatedshack: ...  argh.  lovely teamwork there.  anyhow... realized jack has speech impediments! beD XTC (6:19:00 PM): so yea beD XTC (8:09:28 PM): so yea beD XTC (8:34:39 PM): so yea  hahahahahhahaha.
