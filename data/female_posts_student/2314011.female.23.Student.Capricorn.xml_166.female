Needless to say I was all erect    (well, you know what I mean)  about Vol.II and I went to see it last night... Closure kicks ass! This chapter is just as phenomenal as the first, but in a totally different way. Where you got all the great action and set-up in Vol I, this time you get all the depth and back-story, as well as the satisfying and totally suprpising resolution. The genius of these films is that you KNOW where the story is going, but the methods of getting there are totally suprising and over-the-top in the very best ways. When you expect the epic, you get the intimate; when you think intimate, you get the most epic. Not to mention it's fucking gorgeous! Not only does Q have a great mind for dialogue, but he's got a bitchin' eye. (and uses them in unexpected ways).  The two volumes together are stunning, that's all there is to it. I'm such a slobbering fan, but it's the truth. A beautifully rip-roaring good time, and as much as we might want to see more of Uma and her bad-ass Bride, it's probably good that the story ends where it does. It couldn't possibly get any better than it already is.   So yes, such a great way to celebrate the end of another Crazy 88 week and kick off another weekend full of preparing for finals.  And if you let me know when you're planning on making your way to Pullman, esteemed Q fan and illustrious, wise professor in all things alternative, I just might join you.  We're down to the last week of classes and the obligatory doubts and worries are working their way in.  But they'll listen to reason and a few hokey self-affirmations.  The growing leaves on the tree outside my window and spotless sky help, too.  Once the day really warms up, think I might make it to campus and work on Torts while I work on my tan.  It needs the attention, let me tell ya.  Here I've been so diligently crafting various muscle groups (at first because they really needed some action and eventually because summer was on its way and I needed to get myself ready to display), and the skin coating said muscles is still pastey-assed white.  We can't have that.    It's sick but there's a part of me who can't wait to tackle this semester's exams; to see how the attempt to push myself further worked out; to celebrate the victory of making it through the first year in a manner fit for fairy tales.  And there's another part of me who can't wait to be a librarian.
