Jerm and I spent Friday night cuddling and being happy about having a whole weekend together, but Jerm was really tired from working to much, so I made chicken barley soup and tried to get him to take it easy for the evening. I wasn't entirely successful, but we had a tasty dinner and went to bed by 11:30, much earlier than normal.  We woke up very late, at about 10:00, but it felt so nice to get so much sleep. I made coffee and breakfast while Jerm slept later, and then we decided to go to Target and Ikea, to get a soap pump for the bathroom and to look at entertainment consoles to replace the black behemoth we have currently. On the way, we saw Dave and Alexa getting into their car after getting breakfast on Macarthur, and Jerm called them and asked if they wanted to come. After some initial waffling, they met us at Target in San Leandro that's I'd never been to before. There was just way too much stuff at Target, and Alexa and I looked at shoes and clothes until Dave got impatient with all of us and we had to go back home. We traded cars so we were all in the WRX and went to Ikea, which was a madhouse as always. Jerm and I looked at so many different tv tables, and through various misunderstandings and miscommunications had a fight, so we decided to eat. Yay, Ikea cafe! I had the manager's special and ate way too many meatballs. Yum. I should have gotten a lingonberry soda though. That would've been tasty too. Then we wandered through the rest of the store and no one ended up buying anything. Oh well. We all went back to our homes and then reconvened for dinner--this time barbecued apple chicken sausages, veggie skewers, and a big salad. Oh, and a lot of sangria. Whenever the four of us hang out, you can count on booze!  Sunday was devoted to cleaning and reading. Or at least, that was our intention. Jerm and I read the newspaper and had breakfast first, then we finally got going. Fiona and I had made plans to hang out at some point during the weekend, so we decided Sunday night would be good. This was of course not without angst, especially on Jerm's side, but I agreed to make dinner again, and I'd pick her up at BART at 7pm. So as Jerm is emptying the contents of the garage into the driveway, he decides that what he needs are shelves, and Dave is the one to help him. At about 6pm he leaves to meet Dave, Alexa and their truck at Home Despot so he can buy lumber... and I can't leave the house while he's gone, because someone needs to keep an eye on all of the stuff in the driveway. So I start cooking dinner, and getting that in motion, and by 6:45 Jerm calls saying Fiona called, and he's going to pick her up... oh, and Dave and Alexa will come by and hang out tonight too. So I add more food to the stew, and suddenly I'm descended upon by starving hoards. But it was fun. Fi, Alexa and I watched The Big Lebowski while Jerm and Dave built shelves in the garage. We drank a lot and stayed up too late, and I got up early to take Fi to Orinda... but I'll tell you about Monday in another post. Too much good stuff to tack onto the end of this post. Good times.
