There are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to the end, requires some of the same courage which a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men to win them."  -Emerson  Or brave women!!!!  Its been a long few days, but nothing really to report here. More later this week!
