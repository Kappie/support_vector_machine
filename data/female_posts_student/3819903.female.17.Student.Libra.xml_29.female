Mike's Friends came to join us too, along with Caleb and Kraus...lets just say, the graduated seniors of 2004 Kicked Ass!  WOW there was no competition!  Haha, we played for 3 hours!  It didnt seem that long!  We must have played like 20 innings!  So we were invited to the cook out at The Davis Household afterward...but I came to the conclusion that my stomach hurt too much to go and eat cook out for the second night.  I think I have acute food poisoning from last night at Kate's House, nothing major, just a stomach ache.  Oh well, I can still eat, I'm good then!  So tonight, Kate, Nicole and I are watching some Sex and the City, and just chillin.  A girl's night persay.  Hahaha, I'm watching the Cubs/Brewers game...we won! Cubs Lose, Cubs Lose!
