No i am NOT gonna say his name because well. he doesn't know i like him. or at least i don't think he does. :\. anyways yeah i dunno if i should invite him since well i kinda know him but i wouldn't want him to think "why the heck is she inviting me to a party?" so yeah that is another dilemma. arg god why do i have to think like this. anyone else and it woulda been like "party at my house, better be there" and they wouldn't think twice. well yeah that's me for ya. sigh. i saw harry potter yesterday. i went with my good friend charlotte. we got perfect seats. seriously. it was middle row center. the movie was great. the on ly thing that sucked is that it was really unconfertable sitting in those seats for like 2 1/2 hours. and the fact that there were these i dunno 5 girls that were harry fanatics. they started chanting harry harry harry when it started. and the first time that he came on the screen they all screamed like he was there. and then any time he did something good or when hermione punched Draco they all clapped. i was just like "they can't HEAR  you you idiots!!" yeah that was annoying, but other than that it was  a great great movie. Wish there was more quidditch tho. oh well. next movie right? -drea
