My next goal is to actually charge my temporary cell phone and perhaps actually speak with one or more of you for real rather than chatting online for all of 2 seconds whilst I'm at work.  Speaking of work, have I mentioned lately how overwhelmingly stressful my job has become?  Last year I thought fall semester was stressful because I was finishing my thesis and trying to graduate.  Now I know that it's just insane in general and from now on I'm going to save up my sick leave and vacation time during the rest of the year and take every other week off during the fall...of course, that would probably make the time when  I was at work even MORE stressful...which I think would lead me to actually committing homicide, which would make great headlines for the Gainesville Sun...ugh.  I need to sleep. For 3 months straight.    I feel really bad for Bruce, having to put up with my crazy ass lately.  I won't be suprised if he dumps me because I'm stressing him out so much.  I just keep telling him (and myself) that it's gotta get better.  Only because if it gets much worse one of us (or both) is going to have to be institutionalized.  On a completely random note I'm most likely going swing dancing tomorrow night, which will be both exciting and a semi-attempt at working out.  Hopefully decompressing and stress relief will be involved as well.
