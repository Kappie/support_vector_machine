Not because i don't want to, but because I'm literally drowning in everything and i don't have time to recollect my own thoughts.  I lead an life of inconvenience, as though existence itself is a hindrance... Precluding a higher and more important journey and skimming the top off the universe. i cannot sleep, i cannot awake, i find joy in nothing but the end of another day. a few more breathes, a few more words. Such a long time left for a spirit dead as mine.  Oh and here's that song you folks have been begging for.  dear system please don't free us without you we've no cause dear smiling communist we love fighting your wars  Well.... I got the first 4 lines but i can't think of anything else.  Don't you just love militant garage punk lyrics.   SuGgEsTiOnS?
