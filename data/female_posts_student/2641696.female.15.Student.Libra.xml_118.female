I hate plucking. Waxing is painful, but it's quick. Plucking is painful, and it's long. So! Easy to choose.     Among the books I got, though... THE SANDMAN! By Neil Gaiman! His comic series! Omigod!! I love him. You guys all know how much I love him. He is one of the most hilarious and thoughtful and just downright AMAZINGOFANTASTICOMAGNIFICKOWONDERFULOAWESOME writers of all time, so I am very very pleased. Booklore is starting to expand its inventory, I think: they have a lot of cool comics now *g* I got the Nausicaa one from Booklore, actually. That is a  good  comic!!     I'm downloading a Messenger Plus! update, and it is making my conversation with A very very slow. This is insanely annoying. I'll type out a sentence, and thirty seconds later each ... and ... every ... character ... will ... appear ... one ... by ... one.     Ahhhhh! Writer's nightmare!!     It's 29% finished now.     30%     31%     Hah, did I scare you? Did I make you think I was gonna count up all the way to 100%?? *cackles* 32%!!!     There is a whole organization that is about writing a novel in like a month or something. NaNoWriMo. Something like that, at least. It's pretty crazy. And apparently they have a hugely massively fantastic party at the end of it, too =D wee!!     Speaking of hugely massively fantastic parties, A and I are going to the Burning Man when we're 21. hehehhehee! It is a week-long festival of the arts, out in the desert. You basically bring all the things you'd bring if you were camping out there alone (LOTS of water, and some food, and stuff to tie it all down with because winds are usually pretty high and storms are really sudden). There are tons of parties, and it turns into a CITY because so many people go (30 000). You walk around, give your art to people (be that music, paintings, sculptures, etc.), and see what other people brought or built while they were there. There's nothing for sale except ice, coffee and pop, and no cars are allowed. You can bring a bike though! Anyway, at the end of the week, there's a huge bonfire and they burn a 40ft. wooden 'man', in a massive bonfire, with singing and dancing and all that.     This is my dream, folks. I'm going to a Burning Man when I'm old enough!! Partay partay partay!! *Italian chicken dance song playing in the background* w00t!
