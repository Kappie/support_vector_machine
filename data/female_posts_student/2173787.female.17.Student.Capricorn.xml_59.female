I really should be leaving to go up to Kanata but instead I'm sitting here stressing about events that haven't happened.  I've changed so much since the start of the summer and i am sure they have too, yet we will all go tonight and pretend to be the people we once were or just stare blankly at each other thinking of all of our memories.    It all reminds me of a quote from Gatsby, "there must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.  It had gone beyond her, beyond everything.  He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way.  No amount of freshness or fire can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart."  I recently found an old roll of film from freshmen year that had not been developed.  i got back the pictures today and realized that while i recognize us we are totally different.  They are mainly pictures from English class, some project or another, and consist of Erica, Trevor, Chris, Diana, Kit and me.  Kit is in nearly every shot, but in newer rolls seems to have disappeared.  Suspiciously lacking are Sam and Hannah, but they didn't have English with us.  Time is slipping away from me...I'll reminisce later.
