The girl smiled and pointed to the sky, a cloud drifting lone  Sometimes I wish that when bad things happen, we could just run Sometimes I wish that we could just fly away But sometimes we never know that trouble will not come again We never know when we'll miss it till the very 'One' day  I wish I could get the butterfiles and feathers To lift me up to air Take me away from those dead matters Spirit me to somewhere  Sometimes I wish I can go to sleep And live a new life in my dream Away from old people to new places To a place where there's new faces  I'll like to dream to butterfiles, feathers and clouds Things to take me away Fly me to my dream home To paradise we all crave  I'll sleep forever in the cold To make my time pass slow I'll wake up to see only white and blue And think about only you  The only bad thing is when the neighbors come to stay She kicks me out and paints my walls grey She invited her friends home in her own way It's then when I'm kicked back to earth again
