She kept saying that I should eat trail mix, but I didn't have the heart to tell her that I don't like peanuts.  It was starting to sound like she was a spokesperson for a trailmix company.    Last night I found out that my trip to Boston is going to be cut short by two weeks.  Instead of spending that time in Oregon having a blast in Portland and Seattle and making incredible memories with B, I'm going to be sitting on my butt at home with a mom that's perpetually pissed off at me. It's not anyone's fault that B's ticket to Portland was purchased before I realized that I couldn't go, so I'm not asking myself "How did this happen?".  But I keep asking myself, "WHY did this happen?"  B says that God's not punishing us, but I'm not so sure....   Even though I can understand where Mom is coming from and why she doesn't think that going to Portland would be appropriate, it still sucks that I can't go.  Not only am I losing out on the chance to go to B's hometown, but I'm missing out on being with B  at all .  The time that we have together is so rare and precious, that the loss of even a few days is painful. I was having a REALLY hard time accepting this loss last night.  I wasn't angry at mom (even though she's angry at me), just upset that this is the way things are.  B and I kept reminding ourselves that 5 weeks is still a long time--3X longer than our current record for days spent together.  Since we don't have to study, we have every evening and weekends to travel and go out (or stay in).   After all, God gave us this time together, and he's free to take it away if He wants to.  This is definately testing our patience, and our trust that God knows best.  I for one would still rather not learn these lessons and just have our full 7 weeks together.
