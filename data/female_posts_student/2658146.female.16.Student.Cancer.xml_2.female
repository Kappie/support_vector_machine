He’s cool and stuff, and he’s the only one I know that can make Shippo remotely cool and not want to squish him.  Adam dragged his group over to “repay the favor” of Boots, Ryan, and me visiting them last week. They played Dustin’s game (well, started making characters anyway). Dustin and I are apparently “cool,” since most of the time we lash out at each other, but we didn’t. I guess he earnestly accepted my apology after all.  The other group’s arrival made Dave really stressed. I hated not being able to comfort him. And Lane came, who we were not expecting to come until our next meeting (and apparently neither was she). That really added to his stress since he was totally unprepared.  Dustin was originally going to talk to Dave at the end of his game (or so I was told), but that never happened. I don’t think either of them has any intentions in resolving their problems, and I think if something doesn’t happen soon, all hell will break loose. Not that it’s any of my business. Somehow I feel I’ll get stuck somewhere in the middle…  So then the end of the night came and I noticed Boots had some scratches on her arm. I looked a bit closer and saw they were worn-out letters she had cut. It said "Just a Phase" (I didn't know it at the time that it was exactly what it said, my guess of "just a while" was close"). I confronted her about it at least twice and she kept dodging me. I felt terrible that she couldn’t tell me about it. I tell her about everything about me (well, 99.99% anyway, there are some things about me that no one knows, and I intend to keep it that way), and 97% of the time she’s the first to know (2% goes to Dave, .5% to Ginny and Lane each). But even still, a lot of the things in her DeadJournal were totally new to me, I mean she’s REALLY good at hiding her emotions, but this was just ridiculous. It makes me feel terrible that my best friend can’t tell me about her problems. Sure, I’m not good at giving advice, but a make a damn good sympathetic ear, if there is such a thing. I wanted to cry for her when I went to bed, but I didn’t know what was going on with her life, so I decided to save my tears for a rainy day. I just hope it doesn’t come for a very long time, if at all. Her friendship is important to me, and I would hate to loose her.   Current Mood:  Worried
