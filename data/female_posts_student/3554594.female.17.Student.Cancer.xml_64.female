My hunnie's kisses are so soft and gentle, more exquisite than fine wine. Her slender fingers course through my hair, sending shivers down my spine.  My hunnie's gaze I dare not meet too long, although it may be bliss. For in her eyes of ocean blue, I may fall into the abyss.  My hunnie's an earth bound angel, whose wings she had to shed. If my sweet be my true love, then my true love will b like a bed of blue roses.
