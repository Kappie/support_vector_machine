Last night, Grey and I were talking about how we had both fallen out of the habit of watching The Real World: San Diego on a weekly basis.  And with a show like that, you miss a week, you find yourself out of the loop on things, your interest starts to fade, and suddenly Tuesday at 9 isn't the appointment it used to be.  We both agreed that we'd just have to keep our eyes out for a marathon and catch up then.  So I get home, flip on the tube, and lo and behold, what's on?  Why, a Real World marathon, naturally.  Time to pop in the tape and let it roll.  I'm away from the homestead right now, but it's good to know it'll be waiting for me when I get home, so I can finally catch up on all the skanky details.  At work today, as is sometimes the case, we came across a damaged item that looked tasty.  Today's featured delicacy: gummi peaches.  I've had an inexplicable craving for peaches the past few days *ahem*, and while this wasn't the genuine article, it satisfied my need for the time being.  As far as rankings go in the realm of all things gummi, these bad boys are pretty high up on the list.  About a week ago, I posted a lengthy rant on here about the sorry state of music radio in Chicago.  Well, today, a  new radio station  popped up on the dial that shows all kinds of promise.  When you put on a station that plays, one after the other, Smashing Pumpkins, The Go-Go's, Queens of the Stone Age, and Led Zeppelin, well, at the very least, it's different from anything else out there right now, and it seems like it holds a bunch of potential for something really good.  I'll be listening.  Well, that's it for now.  Big game tonight.  Go, Team That Is Not The Lakers!
