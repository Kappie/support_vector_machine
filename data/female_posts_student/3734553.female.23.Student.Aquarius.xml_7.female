When someone tells methat I don't write enough, I always come away from the conversation a little angry with that person. I guess angry because who are they to involve themselves in something so privateas my writing.   I have such a hard time sharing anything I write. This is like a little exercise for me, getting me to open up and let people read this. It only took me a month and a half to make it a public domain. But I guess this is easier because, for the most part I don't know my audience. I have only given the address to three people. And there are no expectations with this writing. This isn't something I re-worked, or rewritten. Its just scribbling every thing out that is in my head.   I've shared my real writing with so few people. And it always makes me so nervous to hand over one of my poems. I know what goes into each one, the stress or pain. Regardless of whether or not the person can relate to the poem, it will never mean as much to them as it does to me. Are all writers like this with all their work? Or is it just becasue poetry is so personal?   It isn't that I'm not proud of my writing, because I am. I just may be too proud, too scared to have someone not like it. I'm forever rewriting a poem. Nothing is ever finished or good enough. Andthe reason I end up sharing them sometimes is to see if I truly captured the feeling I was aiming for, or if I'm the only one who can see it because I experienced it.     I'm going to send a letter tomorrow.
