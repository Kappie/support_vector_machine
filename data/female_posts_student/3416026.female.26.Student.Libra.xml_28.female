Who sucks more: lecherous, balding, has-been, Fred Durst ... or so-fake-she-is-really-just-made-of-dust Avril Lavigne?  Plus-- since when is Marilyn Manson going to hard-ass-ify anyone's image?  He hasn't been scandalous since 1999.  I bet by this point even  urlLink moms and four-year-olds  get down.
