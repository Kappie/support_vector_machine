It doesn't really seem like much, but when play is stopped in your game and you signal to my friend to tell me about an inside joke that we have with each other it, literally makes me smile *so, so* much.  Thank you for dealing with my insanity and then getting up to hit the snooze for me twice and suffering through the alarm 4 times in a morning instead of just one.  (Also, you're really hot).
