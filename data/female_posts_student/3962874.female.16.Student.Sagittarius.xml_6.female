A guy we all know (who is in love with my sister but definately not her type) walked up to the car and started talking to Amanda. He looks up at me and says hi and then its back to her. Then he decides to compliment her. This is what he says... "You look so much like your sister." awww cute. If he would only leave it at that... "But much better." He says. Loud and clear for Megan to hear, Doesn't that make you feel lovely? Yes my sister is beautiful and you can compliment her all you want. But we are two separate people, both of which have feelings. I believe that I am not the best looking person in the world, and that I have a little extra weight that I could lose. But I am individual. You do not compare two people like that especially me to my younger and hotter sister.
