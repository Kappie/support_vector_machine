Any questions or comments,  urlLink post at the board ... I ain't sure I can keep track of all my online goings-on!   How did I end up with so much on my LiveJournal friends list?  To catch up to yesterday afternoon took 50 posts!  (Okay, mainly their knitting community...) so anyway, not much knitting.  I may check out the LYS if I have time.
