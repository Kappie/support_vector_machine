When I was little I would refuse to test the water at the pool because I knew that I would chicken out at the last moment because it would be colder than what I was comfortable with.  Instead, I would get in line for the diving board and dive in head first so that by the time I knew the temperature it was too late to turn back.  But as I get older I'm no longer able to just dive in.  Instead I must test the waters and more often than not I find myself turning around because the initial shock is not to my liking.  So I sit here now, poised on the edge looking down into the pool beneath me.  How should I approach it?  Should I put my toe in slowly and possibly let time slip past and lose my opportunity or nerve?  Or should I dive in and make a huge splash and possibly bellyflop?  Which hurts more, rejection or never knowing?
