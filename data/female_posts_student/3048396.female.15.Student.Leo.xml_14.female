And I couldnt even see the candle thingy...cuz I was in the choir loft and the piano was right in front of me. So yeah. It was long. Then I caught a ride to the Methodist Church with Alic and Sandy so we could practice for the Good Friday service. Both Trinity and Methodist High School kids put it on...and yeah. I'm a bystander so all I have to do is stand up and shout a few words. It'll be easy. But we practiced for almost an hour and it got boring...Tho the first time we went through it no one could stop laughing...so it was pretty interesting..Cuz Shana and Kim sing the solo parts n stuff and they couldnt stop laughing so everyone that was in the back room joined in. It was quite amusing. So yeah I have to be there at 5:30 tonight so we can go through it all again. Another long night at church. Only 2 and a half hours tonight...last night I was there for 3 and a half so yeah. Otherwise nothing else is going on except that I have to work and do shit around the house all day. If I'm not a good girl I won't be able to do anything...and that will make me extreamly pissed. *sigh* So I guess...nothin else is goin on....  -Tara
