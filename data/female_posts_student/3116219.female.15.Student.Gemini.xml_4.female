It wouldn't have been a party without you guys! Well to start it off when Maria and I got home David was already there and he planned a scheme to soak little kids with squirt guns and water bombs! It worked till they found out that they were throwing it through my sister's window...I swear they are little devils. But yeah then I had to make popcorn and everyone helped with the popcorn pools. We went swimming too. I had to lend Sam my Ford boxers to sleep cause hes a loser and didn't bring a bathing suit. It was funny. They hit me with noodles and I gave a lot of people rides on my back. Then it stormed and it was cool but scary at the same time cause there was a huge cloud swirling above our heads and we had to take down 3 tents. Maria flew back cause the wind was so hard. A pole ramned into my knee but its ok, I lived.Then Chelsea, Megan, Kyle, Jessica, Ashley Bass had left. We went in my room and had a little fun in bed, if ya know what I mean. I'm not going into detail about that. Haha it was fun though. Seraw had a fasination with this vibrating square...lmao. Don't ask. Well I'm out!
