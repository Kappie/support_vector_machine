I'm pretty sure I have established that I love my dreams, right? ..And I do! My dreams are so awesome.. So if I love my dreams so much, why don't I ever sleep (at night)?  ..I don't know either. I don't make sense to myself...  ...I was Big Fish today! ...I was different from what I expected, but I still was good. I cried a lot during it, which is highly unusual for me.. (Eh, oh well..)  Please excuse the sucky update(s)....
