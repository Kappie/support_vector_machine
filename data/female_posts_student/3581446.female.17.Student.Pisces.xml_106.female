Movie reviews are tricky for me, mainly because the reviewer doing the, well, reviewing has to  tell the truth . That aside, let's commence with my truthful and unbiased review of... Troy!  I walked in the theater expecting another  Gladiator . You remember  Gladiator , that impressive movie that was only impressive because it had been 40 years since someone last made an epic like that. We were so awed by the Colosseum and those cool sword fights that we didn't mind suffering through those incredibly dull talk scenes. We didn't mind that the only female protagonist was a blubbering nuisance and the so-called evil emperor was nothing more than a whining baby. But now is not then, and we sure as hell expect a bit more than Gladiator. Did they deliver, you ask? I'll answer your question... after this small commercial break!  I'm just joshing, guys!  Anyway, Troy can be described as Gladiator minus the boring talk plus the attack scene of the castle or whatever in the second LotR minus the stupid Legolas stunts plus Orlando Bloom, Brad Pitt and Eric Bana minus the fake  "trying to act deep"  Bana gave us in Hulk plus an impressive  "storming the beach"  scene a la Saving Private Ryan minus boring blubbering females like in Gladiator plus Brad Pitt.  I'm sure you noticed I mentioned Brad Pitt twice. This is not, as some of you might think, because I like him. I don't. I never thought he was such a good actor. The reason I mentioned him twice is to show how he delivered his role well against all (my) expectations, and to show that I don't like him. This logic makes absolute sense to me.  I'll conclude here, because I don't feel like continuing. Troy is impressive, dusty and has gorgeous fight scenes. The showdown between Hector (Bana) and Achilles (Pitt) is a dance almost. Sword fight choreography is getting popular again, and don't be surprised when we return to the same swashbuckling class and beauty that  Errol Flynn  used to deliver.
