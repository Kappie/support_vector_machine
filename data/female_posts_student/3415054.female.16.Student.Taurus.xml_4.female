I never wanna lose him.. Hes the most incredible person.. n even tho ppl say he only wants some since hes now outta high skool n I be just a junia! aww.. I love the sounda that.. but I dont care. people are gonna talk.. n from now on they can just talk bout how I love him..    Sure.. I might be known as a whore by some.. bitch by others.. but as long as I have my friends who really kno the real me.. it dont really matter.. cuz I have everything that means anything at all to me.
