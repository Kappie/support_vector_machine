Spent a long time on the subject of 'food' (XD still hungry, eh glutton? well, there's a seafood place, maybe you should- *falls asleep*) and also came up with a rather amusing thing concerning X-men.  Bekka: You know that part in X-men? Where, like, Mystique sticks metal into guy's butt? Anneh: He has... buns of steel!  Crude due to tired-ness... none the less hilarious XD  And, meh, deepness in general. ^_^ Thhheeeen I came home, got haircut (It's.. SHORT! *dies*) and basically lived life. Yannow?  On a completely unrelated note, I am about as angry as can be... for reasons... not at anyone who'd actually bother to read my blog, don't worry XP But... Well,  some one knows what I'm talking about.... *patience snaps* Grmmm... they don't... get it... Damn Fuzznuckers..  ~Ryume Of course, you know,  this  means  war !
