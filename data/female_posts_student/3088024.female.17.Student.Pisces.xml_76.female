So guys take off yours shirts and throw on some long shorts that you wear so low it looks like you are pants.  Ladies, put on some short-shorts, or some really tight capris that are really low and a really tight top that show your stomach and has a low neckline.  Its gonna be a party.  Spring break.  Woo-hoo!
