We went to Target today and I forgot one of my bags and a very sweet lady chased me down to let me know. I would have been so disappointed to have got home and discovered 1/2 my things were not there. After that, we went to Cub foods. I was exhausted and sweaty and sooo ready to go home by the time we got to Cub...Of course, I ran into a very old acquaintance. Isn't that just the way it goes. Whenever I look my best and am out in public I never see anyone I know, but when I am looking terrible I see  everyone ! Finally, Nick  I made it home to unload the car, make dinner and put Nick through an awful ordeal of tummy time. Do other infants hate tummy time too, or is it just Nick??? I talked to a mom of a 7 month old girl yesterday and asked her about tummy time when her daughter was Nick's age and she said, what's tummy time! Her 7 month old daughter weighs 20 #'s...My  3 month old  son weighs 16#'s at least! I am starting to worry that he's going to keep growing and growing and growing and never stop. Shawn and I are starting Nick on rice this upcoming week. G'ma Pam recommends it highly and bought us some, but Shawn wants to wait to start Nick on it until he's home for a 5 day stretch to watch he's reaction to it.  Tomorrow I am getting my hair trimmed! Yea!!! Miranda is going to be here at 8:45 am to watch Nick. I hope they get along ok. I love Thursday more than any other day of the week. I am on the SlimFast Diet and we ran out of milk so my shakes were made with the powder and water today. Ick! (I got milk at Cub later on) I restarted my diet Monday and have lost 2 1/2 pounds so far. Only 8-10#'s left until my pre-preg weight and only 15 #'s to my weight goal.  I can do it!  I'm giving myself until Aug. to reach my goal which is realistic, if I can just stick with it.
