I always thought the end of the world is to have both of my parents up at the same time, because they will nag and nag and nag until non stop...something unbearable, something which is a torture. But now, that I realise, both of them were actually very concerned about my school work. They're worried, of course, but I'm tired of their behavoir. So I skipped off to lot 1 to board a bus then went to school...I found pamela with yingge and fanqin [and a 'him', nizam]. So I wait with them, ying ge went off, left the three of us. Nothing to do, I continued to wait with them....finally, janice showed up. So we head of to the sch...and I finally found jaslyn with huiqian and jiayi, then went off to the games stall... watch and walk here and there...sian. Then go to balloon hat stall! Walao...no people sia...thn play games... watch... thn er-went back to the stall, which is crowding with people...hehe. So go there, nth better to do, jiayi buy balloon hat....3.50 sia. Then jaslyn oso lor... thn huiqian stay there, dunno how hor...also helped. I wander around for the whole day, sometimes here, sometimes there. I actually run to grab his bag sia! hahaah.. .who tells him to give me the balloon! who tells the him the whole section sabotage him! hahahahaah.... great fun. Then I got lost from the usual crowd after I give zhen ye the flower balloon which unsually ends up in the rubbish bin! HMPH! jiawen actually threw it away afterwards sia!!! I asked kokting to make me one! hehehe. Then er...wander here and there to find them, sms them but cannot find them...haiz. Saw yuhui, thn listen to the co's performance...thn found them again! but I missed the band's performance...a great shame. Then went back to the stall to help out, sit there...do nothing...cannot play anywayz...must pay lehz..so I see them throw away a proper balloon hor, I go pick it up, thn untie and then play...haha. Huiqian make until so famous sia...Then go canteen and they eat and watch the show. end. I went off to find my mother. Something shocked me, I can't believe my mum is still at all!
