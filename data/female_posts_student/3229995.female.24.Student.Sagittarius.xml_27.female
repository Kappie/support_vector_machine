Nevertheless, they had a couple of genius disco tunes in the late 70s: ‘Yes Sir, I Can Boogie’ and ‘Sorry I’m a Lady’ is still amongst the greatest Euro-Disco songs ever recorded. These two songs where huge chart-toppers in the lat 70s and though the two Spanish girls became just another ‘one hit wonder’ their two hits has stood the test of time. Baccara is a disco act you put on for fun and party, the camp effect is huge.
