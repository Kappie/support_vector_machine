I figured this was a good place to share the many thoughts that I have. Also there will probably be postings that make no sense. But alot of things don't. Especialy when Vicky says something. The creation of this title was very simple. I asked two friends to say each a word then I put them together. It was odd how it makes sense. I like it.  But I would like to say is why are girls so stupid? Being a girl I don't know why I said that but yeah. There are tons of fights, talking behind the backs, PMS could be a major cause. I dont know. I wish that girls could just punch and the fustration and all the stupid fights will disapear. But that rarely happens. Anyways I should stop myself from rambling on.   Hannah
