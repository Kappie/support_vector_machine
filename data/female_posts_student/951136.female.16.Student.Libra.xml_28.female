AND NOT DO IT...sigh. c'est la vie. homecoming. eh, it was all right. i love to dance. so that part was satisfying. tho i SERIOUSLY could not walk sunday. my toes and the balls of my feet were all sore and swollen! i was walking around on my heels. it was great. but the rest, sucked. we sooo should have just gone out to eat and then gone to lazar tag like me and jenn had suggested! dude...that would have rocked! but i was w. jess and jenn the whole time so i was content. but over all, basically pointless. BACK TO " THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION" no, got to take a shower first.
