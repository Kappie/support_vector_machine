What activates the mechanism that makes your hands tug at shirts, to draw in for a kiss? I've often loved myself for not having to rely on other mercurial souls for happiness, but now? Somehow I am so surrounded by people who enjoy life, who epitomize felicity in comfy wuss rock and rides in cars that this euphoria seems to seep into my own pores. I have yet to learn to deal with it, but perhaps that's for the better. I don't know if I should feel jealous or loved or just take the old amused spectator stance.  I can't believe they're doing what they're doing in MT. I have one of J's songs stuck in my head, and I just remember this morning as a cloudy day with that clangy music and a whole bunch of craziness from fatigue. J and C, yes, that will be a good one to watch unfold. Apparently, they're keeping it from A and M because one will naturally spill and the other one is, quote unquote, too stupid. It's supposed to be some big joke to get back at the two cackly ladies who are so intent on screwing around (or, in harsher terms, fucking with) our lives. Naturally, it almost irritates me too in light of what happened and why. I hate to think of myself as resentful because I probably brought it on myself, and it will just be another emotional salad for me. Ah yes, salads, like the one almost spilled, the one...  I realized just this morning as I stepped into the shower that today's Friday the 13th. And then I turned around and didn't think it was so bad since it's only two months until I can celebrate being 16. The way people perceive things.  Perhaps it's for the better, but I don't even know R anymore. I think of it in terms of what he wears: he will have new shirts that I've never seen before, and it doesn't bother me anymore. I'm surprised that I could ever give someone up so completely, but then again it was for the better and I'm much saner and much happier without it. Got a sadistic kick out of going home with J and just seeing him standing at the foot of the bridge while everyone said their goodbyes and went home...  What, I ask, makes people tick?
