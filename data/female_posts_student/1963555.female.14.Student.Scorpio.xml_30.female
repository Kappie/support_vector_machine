It wasn't a good day or a bad day.... like a regular day with out anything bad. I guess thats how you would describe it. Ugh! I still have that oral report due but I never get a chance to do it. I don't really wanna have to get up infront of the class and talk about Teen Suicide anyways. CRAP!! I have nothing to say at all.....  Q: Do you think we have:     A) A gurdian angel     B) An gurdian alien     C) Both (I think both)     D) Neither
