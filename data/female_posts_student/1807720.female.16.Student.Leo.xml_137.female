Bio was really good today.  She explained the lab which was soooo nice, because it Chem they always left us in the dark and confused about what we were suppose to be doing.  I also auditioned for the play today and I think it went really well.  Drama was fun today and we got to work on our scenes for the Feb. 18th performance.  I am so excited for that, but I hope we don't get alot of homework and tests the day after.  English was pretty good too.  The other day she asked me to read, and well it was kind of creepy but like she was calling out names for attendance and she called me "miss vanessa" - that was a little creappy.  Overall I did have a good day, and mat and I kind of talked a little bit.
