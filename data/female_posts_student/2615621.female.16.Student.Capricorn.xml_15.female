I just read ur blog and u know i can totally connect to you and now i see why im your friend. Not like i havent seen before, but just that i realized another reason why. I know what you mean about katie and mikel..its stupid...it sucks for andrew...and i have a feeling the "drama" will have a re-run marathon on tv sometime soon...but u know what, i'll be too busy with my own damn life to tune in. Katie needs to stop before she ruins another friendship..takes away another friend...makes another person hate her...or hurts another person. UGH pisses me off too.   You wont only have Blood hun...who knows...i met lorne in a weird situation and hey, i hear that guy has some friends...lol u know what im talkin about.   Just remember that i'm always here...and i've been through most of it too...hey corey did say u were fucking hot. lol whatever happened to him? and i promise chicken shit, i'll never ever ever tell you about a dude and his plans..cuz i found out how it feels..now im sooo nervous about when lorne asks me out..haha   Love ya girl  OH AND U CAN REALLY WRITE A BLOG TOO!!!
