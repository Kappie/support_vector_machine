Mom and I worked in my room for a good 2 hours and we finally called it quits cuz we were both just worn out. And by that time my algergies were kickin in and my throat hurt from coughin so much. And on top of it all the computer pissed me off. Stupid mouse! It annoys me. At night it doesnt seem to want to work. *shrug* Anyways I got off and laid on the couch for awhile...and all the sudden my dad comes down asking who threw his underwear in the garbage. My mom and I died laughing...cuz while we were cleaning my room mom brought the laundry upstairs and tired to give me this pair...I claimed they werent mine. I said they were hers cuz they looked old lady like. Heh I give her crap bout bein old all the time. LoL But she swore they were mine she said they were low cut. So I was like "Bullshit! Give them here I'll prove it!" So I put them on...So my moms like fine...well their not mine...not urs lets just throw em away. Yeah...so it was pretty interesting. I haven't laughed so hard in forever...my mom was bawling...It was just hilarious. All my mom could say while she was wipping away tears was "I can't wait to tell Ross that you were wearing mens underwear." *sigh* Well I had to prove my point to her...and I did. *nod* So I finally went to bed round 12 and I still had to find my bed and make it...it was buried in shit! Anyways....  So I got up round 9:30 this morning and went out to organ lessons. I actually did good this week cuz I actually practiced. Yay for me! lol Then came home and made myself some mac n cheese....I had a super craving for that. Then when mom went to work I did some work around the house and laid out for a good 2 hours. And now here I am. Pretty soon I should go get dressed (since in my swimming suit) because I have to babysit Cassie from 5-9:30. Woohoo more cash! LoL not much tho...Oh well...I've been saving up and I actually have some stuff that I want for my b-day...normally I just get cash...or like this year, my whole room redone. So yeah...36 days till I turn 15. Im such a youngin! *sigh* Oh well atleast Im smarter than some of the older people in my class...that always makes ya feel good. LoL...Well heres the 2 cds im lookin for, for my b-day....not sayin anyone has to get me them....but then again...oh what the heck....here  The Reason - Hoobastank A Few Questions - Clay Walker  So yeah...If you wanna...lol I dont care I'll get money soon enough and buy them myself......well catch ya later  Tara   Current Music:  I Need You LeAnn Rimes  Current Mood:  Happy :D  Quote of the Day:  "It's not cheating if you spread peanut butter allover your testicles and let your dog lick it off cuz its YOUR dog." - Road Trip
