We're supposed to go tomorrow..but we'll see about that..if he cancels on me or not. oh well. i'm not gonna be a girl about it. it's cool...he's a working mannn. I hope he's not one of those guys that you can't take his word for anything. That's one of my pet peeves. My dad used to always do that.  He would be like yay let's go car shopping! and i would get all excited and then after a little while he'd be like wait no..i'm tired. ah it pissed me off.  So i'm still unemployed. which sucks. I have no money and asking for money from my parents sucks. They're not used to me not having money. I've had a job every summer since i was 15, so they're like what? you don't have money? of course I don't have money..I Don't have a job!!! But today I'm going to go by some places and apply. gah. if they'll take me.
