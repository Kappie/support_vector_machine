I have to put in a form on Monday to get it changed, and I hope that's all I have to do. It'll be mighty embarrasing coming into the class with no paper, mumbling about switching out. Crying.  I mightily pwned at CS tonite. I really pissed off Brooks, too. He wanted me to turn off the gravity, and most times people will assert their dominance on the game by telling you to do something, then killing you a couple of times until you do it, or you kick them off of your game. Well, in Brooks's case, I kept killing him and he kept telling me to stop, and I didn't, of course. So then he started insults, and I did some back, and Brooks found out I'm a lot better than him at it. So the worst he could do was call Alex and cry about it, whereafter Alex came back with the same nonchalant news of "Brooks doesn't want to play with you anymore". O, STILL, MY HEART. But really...people get so damn touchy...not about the game, about other people. It's like we can't even respect the fact that some people are new to the game, and sometimes things, like in real life, just aren't fair. That some people are better than others, things like that...yes, I even blame myself in this category. I still blame people as "hacking" when they're doing too good...but honestly, I'm right a lot of times...it's hard to miss h4x4ur$ easily.  I'm starting to sound like that damn book, Catcher in the Rye. Wow, somebody help me...I'm not kidding.  Anyway...I went to Seth's house today, he had a prelim vid of Shitfiend...two, actually. He had one called "THE BAND" that was of us and Alex playing  Freedom ,  Master of Puppets  (mostly), and  Santa's Coming , the CKY version. AND he put part that Chingy song that I think is so godly in there. Chingy is the greatest rapper, right next to 50 Cent. LOL J/K A-HOLZ.   And the other video was called  FIRE ...all of our fire stunts. Yes, that includes me getting my ass blown off my body, a couple of times, and Seth lighting himself on fire, and me filming fire really close up, and us throwing basketballs at Alex while he rides through a flame downhill on a scooter. And other stuff. And  Welcome to the Jungle  is playing in the background. It looks so amazing...the best part is, he says he didn't use hardly  any  of the footage. We have enough right now to put into a full-length vid, but it would be boring. So we're going to stretch it out a bit...shopping cart tryx in winter, fun with leaves and Halloween and skits about 'Nam in the backyard right now. More car stuff, more band stuff, more Chingy. More pool stuff if we can fit it all in. And some of us will probably have nicknames. Like, in the credits of the first cut of the video, Seth refers to me as "assrocket". That's like Art Webb 1986 or Raab Himself for those that follow CKY/Jackass.   I'm eating like a horse these days. I went to this little hole in the wall BBQ joint for dinner...it was pretty durned good. I had a cheeseburger and fries, the best fries I've had in my life, and my dad had a half-side of ribs (that a helluva lot) and okra and baked beans. And so we sat there and talked up a storm with the owners while they cooked our stuff, and they kicked out some homeless guy for the "thousandth time today", and some guy said he thought he knew me but he didn't. The place was called "Justine's Southern BBQ", and there's a teenage girl there named Justine...hence. It'll probably be sold and bought in a few months, it always is, but check it out, it's always some kind of grill joint or another. That was the first time in my life I've eaten there, it was ass-kick.  Well, crack a grin all, this may be the last one you get 'til hell lets out again.   Until such time as we meet, adieu.
