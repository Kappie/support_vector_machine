My sister asked if I wanted to go with her to see it today and I didn't want to but eventually got convinced into going. I bought our tickets walked into the door on the left. A warm room that smelled like pee. Warm pee inevidentably followed my thoughts since it was warm as well. I checked my seat to make sure nothing was in it (puke, blood, etc.) like always (can't be too careful) then sat and waited for the movie to start. We got there early so I did my favorite pastime of embarassing my sister in public. That was fun but then the movie started.  I would have walked out if I had gone by myself and I wasn't tight on cash and didn't want to waste 4 bucks.  What a lousy movie. I was thinking to myself the whole time, "Nobody can actually  like  this." But oh no, my sister thoroughly enjoyed it. Really loved it. So if my not liking it offends you or anything, I apologize but I didn't like it.  I hated the writing. Eventually after the first eon I got used to the dialog but it really striked me as awful when I first heard it. It just didn't seem to fit the movie to me. But what do I know?  It also might have been decent if Vin Deisil (however that's spelled too) wasn't Vin Deisil. If the character was supposed to be completely pompous, arragant and self-serving then he did a good job though.  The lighting of the movie gave me and my sister a headache, she admited. It didn't really give me headache but it got on my nerves.  All and all I think the movie had a lot of potential and if I'm not mistaken it was a book before it became a movie. I wonder what the book is like. Maybe I should really check it out before bashing it so much, maybe it was supposed to be like that and I just didn't get it or something. Who knows. I did like the one dude. Vaako I think it was. He was pretty nifty. I loved that guy's hair. He reminded me of somebody who had the potential of being a psychobilly frontman. I looked him up on imdb.com when I got home and saw that he played Eomer in LoTR. I recongized him after that but had no clue before then. I think that's all I have to say.  Oh no wait. I didn't understand a thing that was going on. I was completely lost. But I think I got the jist of it. Some bad people were taking over other people and somebody needed to stop this. Am I right?  This one dude was pretty spiffy too, I think I understood what his deal was, I'm not sure though and I won't give it away by explaining what he did. I'm pretty sure I know what happened and why.  Luckily for me I drink a lot of water and I had to go the bathroom about half an hour to the end. Whilst I was up I bought some popcorn to keep me occupied for the rest of the movie. I got back 5 minutes later and found that it didn't make the slightest difference. I was still lost and didn't understand why exactly everything was happening except for the very general idea, that I said before. Good against evil and all that jazz.
