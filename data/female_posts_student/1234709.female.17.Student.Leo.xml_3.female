I hung out with justin up at his house most of the day. pretty normal. then went down to see Rusty and sheri and others. of course justin never really hangs around there long, he just kinda drops me there and then is always asked to take some one some where. so yah me and Rusty just hung out talking about different things. some where in there we started talking about me in a black leather out fit and that he like to see it, yah that sorta scared me a little. whatever. well then we headed over to celias so that justin could help Jordan with his car stereo. after taking it over to rusty's they found out that it was fried. my only real problem today was that i think that i was being lied to but there is no real way for me to prove it with out upsetting others. even though i have witnesses to the lie. i guess once again im just going to have to drop it. i hate doing that but well i really have no other choice. well anyways im gonna go cause im pretty tired. oh yah turns out that writting my secret in here was a great idea. geez im smrt. haha  byes
