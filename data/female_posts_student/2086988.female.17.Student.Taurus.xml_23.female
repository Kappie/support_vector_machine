You know a blog/journal/diary is a thing to let out all your inner feelings right? But see this is an online journal, which means all my friends read it and others as well... so do I wanna let out all these emotions? I want to, I especially want the person who means the most to me in my life read it and be like wow, so the question now is, how to say it. I could express it, but he's not here, and I know what I feel, I just don't exactly know how to say it. But here goes. I imagine the first day/night. The tingly feeling in the bottom of my stomach, the nervousness/shyness. The sensation of "is this really happening? or is this another one of my dreams?" Then I look deep in his eyes and realize this is the moment I've been waiting for all my life...He then puts his hands on my sides as we edge closer together...the excitement, the anticipation, finally the moment is here...He leans in for a kiss, I can feel his warmth, the velvety texture of his lips as we embrace. Time feels like it stands still...everything's perfect...I  can see fireworks and now I know the true feeling of love. Everytime I think of David or see his picture, that's what comes to mind. Waiting for him is all worth it, nothing can ever change my feelings for him, they run so deep, to hard to explain, all I know is that he's the only one that can make me truly happy. When we're together "talking" is when I'm the happiest, I don't know if he notices. I'm so lucky to have him in my life. David, I love you, forever and always!   "I know it's nights like these, like the nights that we meet Put my hands on her hips and we swing to the beat Nights like these, when the stars disappear And I give her my word that I will always be there"
