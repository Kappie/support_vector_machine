I talked with Joe a bit and got a huge wave from the Hot Hy-Vee guy  ;-) (*huge smiles*).  I don't know what you're talking about Renae...saw me look where?  I must say I loved that song The Tide, the line that goes "Heaven's not a place that you go when you die.  It's that moment in life when you actually feel alive."  Aww....  After that Renae, Megan and I went to the O'G vs. RHS boys bball game.  We stayed for all of a quarter and a half.  Then left to go back to Cool Beans b/c Renae wanted a Sandwich but once we got there she decided against it and since I wanted Arby's that's where we went.  Erica was working and we got to talk to her a bit.  When we finished Arby's I brought Megan home and then returned Renae to her car at my house.  But on the ride back to Megan's we went by the "Chevy Chase" house, which is so bright you can see it from outerspace!  But on the way Renae declared she wanted to go to a club, not just a club but a bar.  This landed on her profile tonight: moment of the day:  me- "I wanna go to a bar!"  kayla- "WE'RE NOT 21, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU RENAE!"  ah good times.    The night received a 9! God Bless!
