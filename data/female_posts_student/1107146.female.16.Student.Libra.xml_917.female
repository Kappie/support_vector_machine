Actually, yes, do tell me, my bullshit detector is going off on this one considering some of their other "experiements," like a mouse with human intelligence, which is just a bunch of flash and smart macros, or a genetics detector you can do ONLINE, just put your thumb to the screen (?). Or how about nanotechnology...o wait, that won't be coming out for the next three hundred years or so.    But this last one actually got press. I don't think the vital signs are real, nor is the sonogram, but it in itself might not be real. It says he'll be having the baby in private, so I don't believe it. And yes, you just read "HE'LL be HAVING THE BABY." This is fucking rich.     urlLink http://www.malepregnancy.com    Now watch me look like an ass because I missed the one little line on there that said "PSYCH! Morons, joke's on you." But in my defense, I STILL can't see how this could be real.
