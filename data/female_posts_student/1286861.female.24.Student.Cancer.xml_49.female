At least I think that was what he asked, if it wasn't I have no doubt that he will correct me :)  Here it goes...(in no particular order)...   1.  "Surfacing"  Sarah McLachlan-  Sarah writes and sings her songs about the worry and care that she has for other people. I can relate to her helping hand, her consideration, and her pity.   2.  "When the Pawn"  Fiona Apple-  Fiona also writes about her feelings for other people, the men in her life to be more specific. I can see myself saying many of her lyrics to the men in my life. And dammit do they deserve it.   3.  "Tails"  Lisa Loeb  Nine Stories-  I love listening to Lisa and her lyrics. They are fun, child-like, and at times far fetched. I can lose myself in her music and her lyrics. Her songs bring me back to the time where I embarked in my theatre aspirations. I remember listening to her in the car too and from rehearsals, singing at the top of my lungs.    4.  "August  Everything After"  Counting Crows-  Jonathan Vaughan, one of the first loves of my life, introduced me to the Counting Crows my Junior year in high school. He had just moved out from Texas and was in my drama class. We clicked immediately. To this day he is still one of my bestest buds. One of the few friends that you know where ever you end up, you will always have their telephone number. Jon and I used to sing these songs together...He on his guitar while I created harmony lines in my head...I miss him. This is our album.   5.  "We Can't Dance"  Genesis-  First of all, Phil Collins is wonderful. Second of all, this album reminds me of my family and our funny side, as well as the serious moments that we share. And there is a song about crashing cars...Why I relate to that I have no idea.
