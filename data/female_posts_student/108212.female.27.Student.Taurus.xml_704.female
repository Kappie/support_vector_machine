I have been so busy cleaning house(work),  that it has foregone me from blogging.  The  urlLink tea ceremony  is a chinese tradition.  Read more about it on the link.  The Sopranos' second episode premieres tonight.  So far Toni Soprano has a new scheme up his sleeve-Hotels.  Moving right along, Toni got an idea in his head to hide is Simoleons in his back yard.  He put some in the tool shed, some in bags of nuts, etc. Cant wait for the next show.  Gotta go for now.  Its about to start.   More to come....  NET
