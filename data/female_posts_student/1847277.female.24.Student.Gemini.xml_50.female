I didn't drink enough to get wasted but I did wake up this morning feeling all fuzzy and dehydrated.  Makes it harder to get up the motivation to study for prelims, but since I didn't do much yesterday, I suppose I should get crackin.    Matt and I have started talking wedding plans (okay, I'm doing the talking and Matt listens and tells me I'm silly most of the time).  We're debating about the wedding party. Matt originally argued we didn't even need one and it wasn't a crucial part of the wedding.  But of course it is!  And then there's the fact that I don't have any close friends who are girls, and it would be dumb to ask people I don't really like/know just to be conventional.  Better to have someone who I know and care about, and call them bridesmen or something else.  I can't find much etiquette advice online about what to do in this situation.  But I'm glad that I have friends who are open minded and willing to take part.  Yay.
