I woke up early (8am) so that I could take my car for an oil change and such at Saturn... yeah... along with other concerns I had that I wanted to get checked... it took me about 2 hours... But at least there were free doughnuts and coffee and TV.  :-\  Okay, that's not MUCH consolation.  I did get to flirt with a cute mechanic.  THAT DOES COUNT!  He was pretty cute... most latin guys are (to me, at least).  Hmmm... so, someone should give me some advice on what I should do about the Steve situation.  I think I may start to like him again if I'm around him another week.  He's been hanging around me a lot.  Friday he came and sat with me for about 45 minutes just to "hang out."  At least, that's what he told Angela (another gal that works at Steubing) when she asked what he was doing with me.  "I'm hanging out with her... Kelsie is the best..."  What does that mean?  Kelsie is the best... the best what?  The best rack of tits at ASK... the best manager... or just the best... person?  *sigh*  I don't get it... I don't understand what he wants from me.  I mean, that's not the only thing... He also came and had snack with me... and helped me do a number of things... this is all instead of going with the kids. Before anyone gets all in a tizzy about why am I letting him just leave kids alone, we were OVERSTAFFED (first time in MONTHS) since he was there.  Technically, we haven't needed him.  So one of the newbies was coupled up with him in a group of the older kids.  PLUS, Friday was early release day, and we started out with like, 50 kids (as opposed to 75).  Yeah... okay... ADVICE... SERIOUSLY!  I don't know what to do.  I think I'm starting to be okay with the idea of dating him again... but I dunno if I should do that.  He's not coming back to ASK next school year (he's going to focus on school so he can be done... he'll be starting as an EMT after next semester if he gets it done)... so I wouldn't have to worry about that whole "we work together and I'm sick of you" thing... or the "we can't date because I'm your superior" thing that ASK is against.  **SIGH**  Leave comments... lots of good ones!
