Today in class: what do we look for in the sigmoid colon, apparently that is where some people lose their vibrators.  Our instructor claims that when that happens he just looks for the medical student with the longest thinnest fingers.  Am I ever glad that my fingers are short and stubby.    Last day of stage I in medical school, one more day closer to becoming a full blown malpractice case.  I can't wait.  Night spend partly doing yoga.  My male yoga professor was talking about how badly he needed a pedicure.  I think I need one too.  I like this whole metrosxual thing happening, maybe in the future I will be able to go for pedicures with my boyfriend and male friends, quality bonding time in my opinion.  The rest of the night was spent at the anatomy lab, looking at cadavers in very poor shape and learning the blood supply of the abdomen.  I can't stand anatomy, I hope I never find out I really want to be a surgeon that would be the death of me.  I would have to learn all the names of things named after the old anatomy masters, at least they had fresh bodies and not the formaldehyde ones, they smell of the preservative is just too much for me.    urlLink Stephen Harper  promised to finally lower taxes not only below US levels but the lowest taxes in the world!!!  I am dancing in joy.  Things that are useless and that my tax money will not pay for anymore:   1)	No more decent public education for anyone! At least Canada can be number one at something, illiteracy baby!  If you are teacher you will be expected to work mostly pro-bono.  Those lazy teachers finally will get what they deserve. 2)	With illiteracy there will be no more informed patients to whine about how your management of their illness sucks.  Finally unquestionable control, the reason why everyone became a doctor 3)	No more publicly funded health care, fantastic! I can charge whatever I want for my services !  A cow, a horse or a BMW!! 4)	No more road safety, no more road repairs.  If you can't afford an SUV to go over the holes in the roads well you are a loser who doesn't deserve to drive 5)	Decrease the pay of police.  Well, those good for nothing cops can get their salary like every other hard working police entrepreneur in third world countries, they can simply stop and bribe people, hello free market!  6)	No more welfare.  All those mothers with young children that can't afford health care on their minimum wage salaries can just put their kids up for adoption or to work, pickpocketing has never looked so good. 7)	The best part is that my taxes will go to important things like the army to support our best friends and closest allies, the United States of America (I really like Americans but their government I can do without).  I always wanted to die for big oil!
