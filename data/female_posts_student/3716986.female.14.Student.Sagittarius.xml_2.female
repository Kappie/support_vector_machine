Well, I had a filling today because my dentist kinda fucked up my tooth before, so it took it upon itself to die. Good, because I missed two lessons; bad becuase now that the feeling's come back, it hurts. Ah well. At least now I'm completely mobile for the first time since the gig I went to on Thursday. Lots of moshing... Also, I've just gone up a gauge. Yays. That means my right ear is 2g now. (Confused?  urlLink Here you go.  That should explain).  Well, nothing else happened to me that I can think of, so I suppose I'll just have to have a Random Crap For The Day section.   Random Crap For The Day:  What if I could go to sleep for days?  Would you count the hours? Or would your restlessness cosume Fading memories of me?  Lyrics, but I think I'll leave it to you to find out who they're by.
