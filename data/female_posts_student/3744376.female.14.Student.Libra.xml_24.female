That is when love hurts the most.         3- The sky has lost it's color, The sun has turned grey, At least that's how it feels to me, Whenever you're away    4- It's not that I wanna be the only girl in your life, I just wanna be the only one that matters    5- Love is one of those crazy things, That no matter how hard you try, You just can't find the words, To tell what you're feeling inside    6- Somewhere between all of our Laughs, Long talks, Stupid little fights, And all of our jokes, I fell in love    7- People that laugh a lot cry a lot, Because it only takes one smile to hide a million tears    8- Once in your life you'll find someone who will turn your world around, And pick you up when you're feeling down, Don't worry about missing someone from your past, Cause there's a reason they didn't make it to your future    9- If you look inside a girl's heart, You'd see how much she really cries, You'll find hidden secrets, Best Friends, and Lies. But what you'll see the most, If how hard it is to stay strong, When nothing's right, and everything's wrong    10- Life doesn't hurt until you have time to yourself to think how things have changed... Who you lost along the way and just how much of it's your fault                  My heart is barely beating.             survey                  --Your Favorite on opposite sex--  Hair Color:: Brown :-) Eye Color:: Brown/Green (Their)Music Genre Preference::  punk/rock!
