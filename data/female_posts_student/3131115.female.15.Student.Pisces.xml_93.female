I put like electrilcal tape over it and shit...and it hurt like hell sleeping with it in, and it hurt like hell taking it out. Grrrr...It didnt turn out to look how I thought it would. Oh well though...whatever. I guess that I'm stuck with having short hair...*sigh*Anyway...I can't wait to go to Bill's today. It's going to be awesome because we're home alone for a couple of hours. We'll most likely be practicing forour new band 'All Hope Denied'..Bill says that he's going to teach me how to play the drums and that's going to be our new band..but haha....I can't do the simplest thing on the drums so I'm not going to be able to do it. I was playing and bill was playing guitar and singing and it sounded nice, but I'll fuck up or something and he'll look back at me and I get nervous and I can't do it anymore. He get's mad..which is going to suck so bad when he tries to teach me and I can't do anything. Eeek...Oh well, I'll update...tell you how that goes.  I have to get in the shower though because I'm leaving at 9:30. Yayyy! I'll update tonight.
