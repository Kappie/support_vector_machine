Ya know, sometimes I have to wonder if the reasons I get angry at people are simply a result of things I've done. I mean, I don't get mad at people often. I mean, it's rare that I get angry with someone, because I find that most things are just too petty to stress and argue over. And if I do get mad, 99.9% of the time I just keep it to myself, because I realize that it's usually a huge misunderstanding, and if I just wait it out or confront the situation nonchalantly, then everything can fix itself without making a federal case out of it.  But sometimes I feel as though people intentionally do things against me. And it's not that they're doing it in spite of me, but rather out of the jealous, selfish human nature that everyone has. I'm very guilty of that sort of thing. I often find other people's success to be a damper on my happiness and my feeling of success in my life. Yes, it's self-centered, but there isn't a single person in this world that isn't guilty of it, and by coming out and admitting that I'm  very  guilty of downplaying and sometimes attempting to sabotage other people's success, I would consider that I'm probably more in the right than those of you scorning me for such a thing. Because everyone has been guilty of it sometime in there life, and I believe that if anyone would try to deny it, they'd just be lying to themselves. Yes, I am a jealous person on many occasions. I've just come to realize that people aren't happy in  spite  of you, as silly and ridiculous of an idea as that may be, for some reason I can feel that way. I wish people would realize that I'm not doing anything in spite of them, and that I'm just thinking of...well...myself. But when it doesn't concern other people, I don't understand why they have to get so offended. Well, I do understand, I suppose, but I feel a little betrayed to realize that sometimes people aren't out for my best interests.  It's probably just all in my head. I just need to start relying more on myself to control my life a little more.  Well, I'm off. Have a lovely day, crazies!
