For example:  I went to history class, went to geography class, and then was walking home.  I made it all the way across campus and was on the home stretch across the parking lot towards home. I hear my name; it was the freshman dude from history.  (The one I walk with every Tuesday and Thursday to my next class). He says that he had been trying to catch up with me for a bit. (I tend to walk fast everywhere I go.)  So we walk across the parking lot...to my apt. He had said that he had wanted to see my bead thing that I had been telling him about.   ?   So I go upstairs and can't find it. I go back downstairs and say "I can't find it, it's piled somewhere in my totes that I have for moving".  He's like "oh, you're moving? I can help."     Um....? I say, "No I move in a couple weeks, but thank you. :)"  So then he said that he has nothing to do all night, no work, no school stuff. He asked what I wanted to do. Well, he already knew that I'm way busy all week with school projects and papers...but I say hey lets go play video games or pool. So we walk back to campus and play videogames and pool for like 2 1/2 hrs.  I couldn't pick up on any signals...one would be like a friend and the next would be in each others spaces. If you have been single you'll know what that means.  He kept asking about what I wanted for dinner. I was all like...is this hanging out or not? I don't have any money, so I'm not going to say hey yeah good idea and then not eat..or something.   So we walk back to his car...and i have him drive me home...I don't know...some way to waste time and prolong the decision making process. I said that I have grammar to work on tonight...he already knew about the 6 big papers/projects that I have to do.   I don't know. It's been along time since I've been part of a couple. So even mini conversations that could be geared toward liking someone are really really difficult for me. I hate how non-light-hearted I've become. But seriously, how many guys do you know want to hang out? Not too many. I mean everyone's busy with their own time..work..school..that I just don't get the friend thing. In my mind, if there's absolutely zero chance of liking a guy...he's not even on my friend radar...but if he's likable in that way...then it's a possibility to go directly toward liking.  Ugh, I need to revamp my little chit-chat skills. Ugh. If you understand what this post means please write a comment. The last two hours were confusing enough; I have no idea what the answers are to my questions.
