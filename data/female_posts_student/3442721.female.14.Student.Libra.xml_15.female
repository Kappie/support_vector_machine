I don't know why he does this and it scares me because he gets depressed at times and then he might hurt not just us but himself. I am really crying for him but yet i can't even cry right now because people are around. i can't find my trueself in this world. Where am I?? Who am I? I really can't tell you all i can tell you is that i'm very close to the edge and i'm about to slip. I think i'm already falling but i won't know it till i hit the ground.
