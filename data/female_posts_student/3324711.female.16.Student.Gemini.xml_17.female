The ending was really sad, and because I get way into books, I cried. This book made so much fucking sense I cant even begin to describe it. Its all about how much America consumes and how its going to affect people in the future. Everything in this book is fake. Their school is called SchoolTM and is run by major corporations and tells them how to control the world by knowing what theyre consuming, etc. They have fake clouds and they tore down all the trees to make air factories. In everyone's brain, they put micro chip type things that are like the internet, but inside your brain. Its called a feed and its like a constant pop up ad. It sounds annoying as hell. And everyone's skin is falling off because of the lack of real air and stuff. Yes, I am a bookworm, Yes, I am a dork. And yes, yes, I am a hippie. But please don't hold it against me.  Tired as hell but I refuse to do my homework and go to bed because Im stupid. Early band tomarrow, I may die.  On the bright side, Behn came home :):):) million smiles, and I got presents :) and me and tyler may be making a acoustic band type thing, which is cool.   Listening To:  silence. Its never quiet at my house. Those of you that have been here know.  .. its a nice change.
