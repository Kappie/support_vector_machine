(yes, you can tell I'm a woman, I enjoy football partly bc of the fact it allows me to openly check out the rears of some hot guys, w/o judgement...I can back it up by saying I'm JUST WATCHING THE GAME!) The halftime show was overrated, and a bit tacky, in my opinion-did Justin really need to undress Janet in front of millions of people? Whatever. He didn't really have to, we can already see she has a better body than 98% of us females. Talk about ab envy! Anyway, I'm sleepy, so it's bedtime.  Love ya'll,  more later.
