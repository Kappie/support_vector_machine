Another good friend contacted me the other day.  It was so nice to hear from her.  I don't talk to old friends too often, I am pretty busy trying to make sense of my life.  i should though.  I might not be so insane.  Who knows.  Anyway...I hope you are all having a great weekend. I am actually trying to finish homework so I am not cramming tomorrow night.  I hate cramming.
