I need to be there for my friends more, especially for things that i have gone through before and know how it feels. I will be there for you, from now on, if somethings wrong...e-mail, PM's, MSN or the phone...I'll do my best to help. I feel so...stupid. Quite frankly I am ashamed at myself for being so blind. I need to open my eyes more. I got a rude awakening and that is why I am typing this. I do care about my friends.  Alot . I know that must sound sentimental and stuff but if anything ever happened to you guys I'd be absoulutely broken. I'd be so...empty. I don't really have anything but my friends. Oh sure I have my books and the computer and my family. But books can't talk with me and the computer doesn't make me laugh. My family...I don't eally know about my family. I guess I do love them..maybe. But my friends are my life, without my friends I wouldn't have life. Please forgive my sentimentality and all that but I need you to know.      Oh my god you're so lonely
