Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me  (Happy Christmas!) I wrapped it up and sent it With a note saying "I Love You" I meant it Now I know what a fool I've been But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again  CHORUS  (Oooh. Oooh Baby)  A crowded room, friends with tired eyes I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice My God I thought you were someone to rely on Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on A face on a lover with a fire in his heart A man undercover but you tore me apart Oooh Oooh Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again  CHORUS  A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (Gave you my heart) A man undercover but you tore me apart Next year I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special special someone someone I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special who'll give me something in return I'll give it to someone hold my heart and watch it burn I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special I've got you here to stay I can love you for a day I thought you were someone special gave you my heart I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone last christmas I gave you my heart you gave it away I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone  ok, I don't care if this song is by Wham. It's amazing. And I've had it stuck in my head all day. Like half the school had it stuck in their head all day, it was insane. And then as soon as we got in the car driving home it came on the radio. It was amazing. If I see you on the street, I  will  start singing this to you. I'll expect you to sing along.
