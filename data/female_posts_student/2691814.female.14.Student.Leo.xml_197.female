Right when i walked in the auditorium i knew something was going on...and the teacher was on the stage just looking at everyone, so i sat down and we all just waited for other people to come in. Little did we all know was that she was studying our body language to see if we're nervous or not. Then she started like staring at each one of us smiling, and some people just cracked up and some people looked right back at her, like me. So then, after all that, she called us up to the stage...my home!!! j/k lol, so we got in a circle and she said well we're all gonna make the ugliest faces and pass them to eachother..like copying them and stuff....and of course i was next to the guy who had to most expression lol. so ya, it was funny. after that i went to English honors and i almost got lost...i had to walk around the building and it took me forever but i got there and we just talked about the different books we'll be reading and projects. Lunch...i went back to my locker to get my lunch and i went to the cafeteria and looked around for my new friend, but she was no where in sight...but that was okay so i saw this guy sitting alone and he looked like a nice guy so i sat next to him and we talked about alot of stuff and then this other girl sits next to me and then we started talking, and now we're gonna sit together during lunch...we're all from different areas so we all dont know anyone. perfect. so after thaaaaat, i went straight to chorus....and looks like i will NOT be going into advanced chorus because...she started saying...how many of u are not beginner and me and a few people raised our hands(note:i've been singing classical for like forever) and then she started asking if like anyone could read all this music and it just blew my mind...and no one could do it so ya...im better off in the class im in and we did warm ups and these like gothic kids behind me started laughing for no reason, and i started to get mad...c'mon guys, take it seriously. but ya, we just sang scales to see who was alto and who was saprano...i will probably get saprano because i can project my voice loudly while singing a high note, but that alto part is hard. then i went to integrated science, and i have a seat in the back...and that was it, then the last bell rang and i waited for like a half hour for mom to pick me up and i was outside so it was realllllly hot. so ya, i guess it went well, i mean, for the first day of highschool, but i cant wait till Acting tomarrow!
