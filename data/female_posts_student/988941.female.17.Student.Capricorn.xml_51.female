People are organizing groups etc.. to go with in limos and stuff yet no one has asked me. I mean I happy to help out organize a little group but I don't want to be like THE one who does.  No, I don't think I will go to the ball after all.  Has anyone else made any other blogs no wthey have an account? If so what are they and I can link them to your name above instead of email or other sites.
