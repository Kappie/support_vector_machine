In addition to the constant dull ache and pain in my abdominal region, every few minutes I'll also feel an incredibly sharp shooting pain--like someone is sticking a knife into my gut.  For the past few days especially, it's been concentrated in the lower right quadrant of my abdomen.  When I saw my gastrointerologist yesterday, he seemed concerned that the pain was not originating from my intestinal region--as I have assumed for the past year.  I had a abdominal and pelvis CT scan today to rule out anything potentially life-threatening, but he says that regardless he wants to do what's called a laparoscopy: a small incision is made in the abdomen, where a scope is incerted and the surgeon can take a look at my female plumbing, so to speak.  He mentioned that due to my history,  endometriosis  is a strong possibility.  While I no nothing for sure yet until that is undoubtedly proven as the cause of my pain, it is still rather unnerving; endometriosis is one of the leading causes of infertility in women.  My grandmother had very painful menses, as well as ovarian cysts.  She eventually had to have a hysterectomy as a result of all the problems.  While I hope I won't have to do the same, I am prepared to deal with the consequences.  Considering all the mental illness in my family, it actually might be wiser to adopt rather than have my own children--though I would certainly prefer the latter.  Uugh.  I hope I get some answers soon.
