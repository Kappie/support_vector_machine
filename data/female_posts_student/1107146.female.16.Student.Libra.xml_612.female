I blame the majority of this on Scott, who slightly misconstrues all situations because HE HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST CLUE WHAT THE HELL HE'S TALKING ABOUT.  He never sees Abby, yet is constantly downing her, and taking you to his level of thinking.  Abby is epitomy of nice and just and fair and anything else that you could ever compliment her with.  Scott is jealous because Josh got Abby and he didn't.  I'm with Josh in that you're really reading a LOT into the situation.  If you'll notice, Abby never got mad.  She barely even showed annoyance.  I'm viewing this as your taking advantage of a minor infraction so that you can blow up at her, which you do not have the right to do.  Josh is most definitely justified in siding with her.  He loves her, she loves him.  Their relationship is not something you see every day.  That in itself justifies him siding with her, and I fully support that.  Abby has nothing on which to base a hate of you, and frankly I think that you're being a bit paranoid and slightly arrogant to think that she hates you.  She's met you for maybe five minutes?  Talked directly to you on the blog maybe thrice?  I know Abby than almost anyone else on this planet, and let me assure you that I know exactly who she does and does not hate.  Does she hate you?  No.  Does she like you?  No.  She has no information.  She has no need to like or dislike you.  The only thing she knows about you is that you have insulted me, and that will be held against you until she dies, most likely.  Other than that, she is, for the most part, completely apathetic about your entire existence.  You really don't have a great impact on her life, like it or not.  And continuing on what Josh said, you stick a knife in his back, you stick a knife in Abby's, and by doing so stick a knife in mine.  And it's me that's going to be pissed in the end, because Abby freakin' saved my life in 9th grade.  I owe her everything in my possession and more, and I will pay that debt if it's the last thing I do, by protecting her happiness and well-being, and that of everyone she loves.  And if you [that being a general you, not directed at you specifically] get in the way of that happiness, then by God if I don't absolutely rip you to shreds.  Josh, I apologize for saying to tone it down.  Perhaps you should stay at your own level.  I forgot for a second that this was Abby we're talking about.  You were provoked and you are justified in your comment.    This should be my last post on this topic.  I hope.  Cause I hate being angry.
