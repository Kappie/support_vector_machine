There is a child or adolescent who hs grown into us."   * We are who we are because of our life experiences intermingled with all the gifts we have been given--not in spite of them. *   I thought this was a good quote especially since I have been doing a lot of soul searching.  I don't know exactly how to explain it so I just made sure to include the quote.  It is something I will be thinking about that's for sure.  Here's another good one:    "To try to ignore or erase our past is to rob ourselves of our own hard-earned wisdom."    I thought that that quote was a pretty thought provoking quote.  I have always been the type of person to live with no regrets, but of course there were parts of my past that I would not like to remember...but as this quote reminds me, it is EVERYTHING in our past that makes us who we are today.    I like this one too!    "Sharing my tears and tenderness is a risky and courageous act of love."    I never thought of it this way.  That is why when I read it, it touched me.  LOL  (Am I in a sappy mood or what?!)  Here is a good one for me to remember...(hey I AM learning)    "We are never really asked to live anyone else's life.  All we have to do is live our own.  That is, after all, quite enough."    I honestly don't think I could have summed it up better.  Why should I meddle in other people's lives, mine is enough as it is.  Great lesson to learn.  Now we come to today's quote:    "Alone-time may frighten us.  It may seem empty, as if no one is there.  With practice we can discover that we are."     * There is no way to know ourselves unless we have alone-time. *   I wholeheartedly agree with this.  I don't get much alone-time, but is sure is comforting when I do have it.  Okay well I am done here, thought I would post some good quotes.  I figured you guys would be tired of my blogs by now.  LOL   HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!   P.S.  Yeah I know the Lakers got their butts kicked.  Pistons wanted it more.  GO PISTONS!  Job well done!
