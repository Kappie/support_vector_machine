(mya song: "tears on my pillow", my pillow is soaked through). im under a lot of stress. im emotionally unstable, who knwos what i'll do next (mostly likely is cry, but who knows) and im also suffering from a broken heart. WHY does life have to be so complicated? i never knew my emotions would get the better of me, but lately, they've stolen my brain or something. emotional. thats what i am, an emo-freak, emo-wreck, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. sometimes im mad, sometimes im happy, most times im sad. *sighz* so what is this thing called life anyways? i dont get it. please, if you have the answer, i would like to know. because as of now my life has no purpose or point. what i need is a friend, a confidant, a ooh ooh i know what i want, a CHUM. thats what i need, a golly good jolly fun chum. where can i find me one of them? someone to have fun with, talk to, they'll listen, care about me. well i can think of someone, but im scared that i'll do sum'n that might make him frustrated or something. i wish i could have that friendly relationship that i wanta have with him, but i feel as though theres something there, maybe another girl? well. as the world turns, so do the gears in my mind, unfortunately the world turning has somewhere to go, my brain just goes on into oblivion...................
