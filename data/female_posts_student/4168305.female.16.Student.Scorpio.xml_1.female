Turns out that she came to tell me she's pregnant... She's only just found out. How coud she not know!? She's seven months gone. She is only tiny though, and doesn't look seven months. She thinks it's gonna be born on my birthday, bless.  I'm a little worried she won't be able to cope and maybe have it taken off her. She's only just been for her first scan, to hear its heartbeat. She's going to see a midwife on Thursday to get a scan and find out what sex it is. I know she's scared of giving birth, but she seems really happy about it.  Her boyfriend is 23, I think at that age he'd have been a little more careful, but by the sound of it he wants the baby too. Shes only 16. A few days older than me, as she always says... "I'm older than you - by eight days!" She doesn't act older than me though. She acts young for her age.  She has always been hyper and immature, although recently I think she's grown up a bit. She used to drink and smoke, but now she's stopped because she's pregnant. I always thought Rachel would be the first of my friends to get pregnant. I was really, really wrong...  I never, ever expected Becky to get pregnant. I'm soooooo shocked. I feel really weird. I felt like this when I was told Dolly was pregnant too. She used to be my best friend, but then we fell out and she moved house. I havent seen her for like five years now. I did once see her in town last year. Anyway she had a baby at 16. She'll be around 18 now. I found out from Vicky that she called it Chloe.  Wonder what Becky will call her baby. She told me her boyfriend wants to call it Libby if it's a girl.  Ugh.  Maybe she'll name it after me, hehe. I am her best friend, after all! Even though we hardly see each other, we have been friends since nursery. Almost 17 years I guess. I think even though we hardly ever see each other, we'll be friends for a long time.  She did get in with a bad crowd, and that's mainly why I never see her. And then there's the fact that she is hyper and immature. Well, not any more it seems... Though she's a little childish. Things will probably never be the same for her now she's expecting a baby. She's going to college in September, and it's due in November.  Not sure how she will cope, but as I'm one of her oldest friends I will do my best to help her. I'm actually looking forward to seeing her scan next week. Boy or girl? She wants a boy, hope she gets what she wants. I'd love to be there for her during the birth as well, but it'd be a little weird.  God parents! Pick meeeee. Lol.  Would be really nice to have a part in it, but I'm not likely to. She's gonna be too busy for me. Well, then again... I don't think she'll know what to do with a baby. I'm guessing her mum will help a hell of a lot. When it gets to be a toddler, things will calm down a bit I'm sure, but knowing how she was as a kid... God help the baby.  She was prodding it today, and I'm like "Don't prod it! You might hurt it." And she's like "No I won't, it doesn't matter if it turns out stupid anyway cos I'm stupid. I dont't want it to be smarter than me!" What? You dont want a stupid baby. You should want it to be smart!  She told me to put my finger in her  belly button  to feel its umbilical cord...  Eeerrr.  I wouldn't do it. She settled with having me feel her stomach. It was hard and ikky.. Well not ikky, but... different.  I never wanna get pregnant. Ugh. Pain!  My mum was saying to me today would she have got rid of it if she knew earlier... And I said no, I don't think she'd ever do that.  Anyway... I'm happy for her if she's happy for herself.
