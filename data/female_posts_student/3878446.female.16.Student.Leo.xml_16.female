It's basically a mix between sardines and jailbreak (I'm going to assume you know how to plays those two games). It should be fun because we're playing it at our church and our church is fairly large and has many things you could run into and get hurt by. I dunno what it is but I enjoy getting bruises and scars from random events. Then after that my friend is gunna come over and stay the night and we're gunna watch  The Butterfly Effect, yay for that, then tomorrow I'm going to go see a movie with another friend, not sure which movie, prolly Anchorman, then sunday I am going to go see King Arthur with my brother, my friend and my friends sister. So there is my weekend. Right so I'm gunna go, in the words of Michelle..."Have Fun, Make Good Choices."...bye
