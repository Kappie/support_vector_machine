I feel I have more freedom to write in this blog. I just gave up writing in that old one; I couldn't think of anything more to say. Not much you can say after 2000 posts, eh?  Anyway, she said to forget it, that she is "mostly" over it. Well, whatever. I'm never signing on to my old screennames again, and even when she finally does stop "ignoring" me by not using the SNs I know about, I doubt I'll give her my new screenname. And she won't know about this journal.  Ever feel like you hate someone, but in moments of glory you realize you love them?  I have decided to make a layout for this thing. I love CSS...fun stuff. Thinking pink, lime green, flamingo-ish? With a margarita. Hell yea.
