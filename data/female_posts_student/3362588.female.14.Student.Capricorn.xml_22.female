The second time, Andrew and James come up to me and are all like, "Will you take us to the bathroom please???" So I get out of the pool and they gleefully yell. "Yeah! Serena's taking us to the bathroom!" I'm like, "Woa there.... boys....." So all the way up and back, they use the worst language they possibly can (I really cannot repeat some of the 'songs' they sang). And they wouldn't listen to me... and mer mer mer mer mer mer mer.     Ooo!! I can do a squirrel dive now!! Woohoo!! It's scary, you totally have no control over what your doing. Scary feeling. Hurts to, sometimes. If you don't know what a squirrel dive is, look it up on Google or something. :0D Freakishly frightening. And yet it makes the adrenaline flow if you do it right. hehehe. I love diving. So far I can do a jump into a dive (really nice), a suicide (those things are awesome), nearly perfect jackknives, pretty nice can openers, cannon balls.... big splash...., and some other stuff. Now I gotta work on my flip. Can't do that for heck.     It was SOOO funny!! I was supposed to go with the first group back to the school, but i didn't. So when I walked back down Brian was tying on Kaiah's hawaiian wrap dress thing, and he's all like styling with it and stuff. And then he's like, "I have boobs!" so he tied to dress to make it puff out and stuff. I'm like, Brian, you are gross. And he was lookin' at me, too. Icky.     And then him and Eric were all styling with it. It was halarious. Eric used it as a turbin and jumped off the diving board 'indian style'. It was sooooooo funny. All the kids were staring at us. And then Brian tied it around his shoulders and did a suicide with it streaming behind him. Steven's like, "Eric is superman!" and Brian's like, "No. I am superman." And then Brian told me to yell WATER POLO really loud 'cause me and him wanted to play, and when I asked him why he didn't do it, he was like, "'Cause I'm shy." I almost laughed. He looked right into my eyes when he said it and looked all innocent and stuff. It was so dang funny.    g2g    -Jak
