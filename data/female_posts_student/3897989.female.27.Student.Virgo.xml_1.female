It's going to be a great day!! I am blossoming. I've also lost a couple pounds this week. I've been working hard and it feels great.    Last night we had a great class. It still seems strange to me that my instructor never gives me any advice, only gently nods of approving feedback while he spends so much time with everyone else reinforcing strokes, etc. My humble confidencecontinues.Even stranger, someone who is close to graduating in our class has to turn to me to be able to utilize the lesson effectively. It feels great to have the "best" and the prettiest of the group turning to me for guidance and tutelage.    I'm looking forward to some free time for myself and the children Sunday. I found some great books on sale at work yesterday that I'm truly looking forward to burying myself in to relax.    Thank you for my peaceful heart, my grateful existence, my energy from you, my universe. Thank you for letting "him" connect with me again to renew my strength in bonding and relinquish my ties to subtle solitude.    With love,    BLG
