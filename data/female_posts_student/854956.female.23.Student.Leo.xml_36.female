Then I won't have to answer one question several times.  : )  Zack is a guy that I met on TSO (The Sims Online).  You meet interesting people in there, lemme tell you.  The first person that I met on TSO was a guy named Trevor... we got to chatting because he lives in Dallas... and so we had a common ground.  Anyhow, he and I chat on AIM every now and then, and he invited me to a live chat with the Maxis people back before TSO went live.  He works for a computer company, so he has connections.  Anyhow, long story short, meeting him and his wife thru the internet showed me that not all people in the digital world are freaks.  Anyhow, so I guess it was the same week that TSO went live that I met Zack (Damien Michaels is his sim's name).  Anyhow, he seemed really nice, and the more that he and I carried on conversation, the more we kept saying what the other was thinking, or typing things out exactly the same at exactly the same time.  So, we decided we had way too much in common to NOT keep in touch... and thus our friendship was born.  Zack, however, made a comment probably the 2nd or 3rd day that we talked about how we were probably soul mates... and that we met each other for a reason.  And he'd joke about how he was going to come to San Antonio, yada yada yada.  Harmless jokes.  Anyhow, so we decied to swap email addys, and keep in touch that way, because it's not always convenient for us to hop on TSO.  So, first thing's first, we told each other basics about us (i.e. how we grew up, what our family is like, funny little stories from school, and what we wanna do in life).  He's a really nice guy, we've become friends, end of story, right?  Wrong!  Especially when he makes comments that we were married in a former life.  I dunno... it's weird.  Sometimes, I must admit, I do get an eerie feeling about how odd it is that I met someone who is really nice, has a great family, and essentially holds every quality I've always said I want in my future husband.  He grew up going to church, he's pretty dedicated to serving his Lord, he has musical talent, his family is much like mine, etc.  Problems with this too-good-to-be-true guy:  Firstly, I met him on the internet!  YIKES!  That scares the Hell outta me!  Then again, I DID see a "Wedding Story" episode where the couple met on the internet.  Secondly, he lives in North Carolina.  That's kinda far away.  Then again there are perks to this story:  He's finished with college (as opposed to the last guy I dated who ISN'T finished with college at the ripe old age of 31), he has a stable job (he works on construction sites, testing the soils to make sure that they're usable for roads, buildings, etc.... However, his degree was in Hospitality Management in hopes of opening a themed restaurant, or running a resort), he is only 5 years older than me... which isn't that much older... and technically I believe it's more like 4 1/2, from what I understand he'd be willing to come here to visit and/or stay, and I've seen a picture and he's not a mutant (like Ricky suggested)... he's very normal, and just nice, well-kept looking.  I dunno... all I know is it's scary.  It's odd to me that I could potentially have met my "soul mate" on an internet game.  That just seems weird.    My Take on it All    My plan is to remain friends for now... if something should happen in the future... then I'll let it.  I don't plan on initiating any form of relationship OTHER than friendship.  I have other things that I plan on focusing my energy on right now.  Like finishing school, and getting my teaching certification, and my friends.  I don't even know if I want a relationship right now, because that's a LOT of work to do... and more so w/ school going on.  Jennifer is all concerned... she's afraid I'm getting attached and that he'd be different if I ever DID commit to meeting him and spending time with him if we visited each other.  Well, yeah... that's true... but in the same respect, that can be true even if you met the person for the first time face-to-face.  People often are different when trying to win someone over to date... and then their true colors come out later.  That can even happen with friends, as all of us have found out in past times.  My goodness, how long did I know a certain drum instructor, and NEVER did I think he'd turn out to be the way he was!!!  So, yeah.  That's just a risk you take when getting close to someone, I guess.  But, I'm comfortable with just being friends.  And like I said, if something happens later... then let it be.  "For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see, there will be an answer, let it be."  And on that note, I shall stop talking about all this... because it makes me feel confused.  Comments may be left... just don't be really harsh... I have a feeling most will say, "You ARE attached"... well, yeah... as a friend...  I'm attached to Ricky, Druck, Jen, WOLF... etc.  But as a friend...        urlLink  postCount('28Jan2003');
