Don't get me wrong, I think it is horrible what we did. I don't excuse it or agree with it. However, when Berg was executed the media only focused on that for like, 10 seconds and then it was right back to the prison scandal. I think we need to show the enemy's atrocities just as much as we show ours.   It is absolutely horrible what happened to Paul Johnson today. My heart goes out to his family. However, it is times like this, that it is more important then ever to show the true horribleness of our enemy. Will big media show the images? I think they absolutely should.  I also think that these terrorist need to be taken out of the equation. They are horrible, horrible people who will do anything to anyone to ensure their survival, and their power. Their unbridled hatred for us scares me to death. They have to be defeated.
