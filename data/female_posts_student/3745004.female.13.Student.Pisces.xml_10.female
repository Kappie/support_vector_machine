Humph.. I see how it is! >:P Just kidding of course. Anyway, I'll be here, posting, until she gets back, then she'll have to make some major postage! I'll keep my eye on her, make sure she's in line! >:3 Hmm.. moving right along, anyway.. I have nothing to say, currently, I really only posted so that people would know it's just me. Poor ikkle SDchan Hoshi all by herself. *sniffle* Oh well.. s'all good. See y'all around!   Love and Peace Out!  ~Hoshi-chan.. neh?
