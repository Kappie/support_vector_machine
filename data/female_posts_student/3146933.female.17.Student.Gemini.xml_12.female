Brandon was in the front with Patrick and then in the middle was Monica, me and then Dustin...and then this guy named Greg was just gonna sit in the back...where there's like..no seats but one of the women wanted him to get out b/c they thought Patrick would get in trouble...SOOO me and Dustin ended up ridin w/ Dustin's mom on the way down there...and that Greg dude took our seat!! :( When we got there...oh Lord...it was HOT...me and Monica only brought a blanket to sit on...BIG mistake...the ground was still a little wet from the morning rain and our butts got wet...haha..but it wasn't too bad b/c other ppl's butts were wet too from sittin on blankets too :D hehe! Anywho...this girl and her bf wanna sit on the ground for some unknown reason and they gave me and Dustin their chairs...*thank them!* and so that was better. Once it got darker...it was much much better...and cooler...but yeah Dustin was all holdin my hand again..*sigh*...it was sweet...SOOO on the way back...we rode with Patrick...and that Greg dude rode with someone else that lives close to him. Aw and Dustin was all holdin me and stuff...and Brandon was on the other side of me...lol..oh my..he kills me..and Monica sat up front with Patrick. So anyways, it was a good time... :) MUAH!! yeah baby! I talked to Brett when I got home...I guess he was a little tired though b/c when my dad called...he got off the phone with me :(.... ugh. dad. yeah. he calls FREAKIN out and yeah he sure did ground me....I won't EVEN get started on that. Dad's ghey. I'm tired. Goodnight.
