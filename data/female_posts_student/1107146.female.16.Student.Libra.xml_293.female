"Hey, Rosie told me to tell you to call her, but she's not tryin' ta lead ya on, 'k?" Fokkin' ridiculous. No matter what, this can't come out good for me, so I'm going to save my own ass on this one and just pat you on the back and say, "Gooluck bud".  Fokkin' ridiculous. Heheheh.  But I want to ask something so ring me up at some point.
