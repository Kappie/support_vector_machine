Anyhoo, after that, I wasn't ready to go back home, so I decided to drive across the street to Barnes  Noble.  I was almost done with my current book, Big Fish, and so I decided to get another book to read next.  I had read a lot of reviews and synopses about The Purpose-Driven Life, so I decided to check out the book and possibly buy it.   I read a little bit of the introduction that told what the book consists of and such.  Sounded good.  Before I bought it, I went to the magazine rack to buy the new Oprah  magazine for my mom.  While I was standing in line to buy it, I spotted an interesting sounding book called something like A History of Secret Societies.  The line was too long to jump out then get back at the end, so I admired it from afar.  Bought the book and the mag, both of which were under twenty dollars.  I also picked up a gift card for someone.   I decided that since I was having such a great time out on the town alone that I'd stop in the cafe and order a hot chocolate.  Did that and sat down to thumb through Oprah.  Like a good girl, I called my mom to check in and say that no one kidnapped me.  As I was talking to her, all of the sudden, I blurted out "F***!"  Heads around me turned and of course, my mom said, "What?!"  As graceful as a  ballerina, I totally knocked over my hot coco, causing it to create a  flowing river on the table cascading onto the chair.  Not only did it hit the table, but it splashed all over the window.  It looked like a bird crapped all over the window.  It was SO embarrassing; being in this posh, quaint cafe didn't help the situation either.  Not only did heads in the cafe turn to look, but I disturbed these old Italian men who were competing in backgammon games.  They muttered something in Italian and laughed.  *deep  breath, Megan*  Told my mom I had to go and cleaned up the mess.  What an adventure!  Anyhoo, tomorrow's plans (in no particular order): 1.  Outline ethics paper on abortion 2.  Go to gym 3.  Book Hawaii trip online con mi madre 4.  Babysit Paces (the Willow Glen tykes) @ 6pm 5.  Practice Wonder Woman and Jeffersons dances 6.  Start my purpose-driven life 7.  Relax?  (Seems fitting for #7)
