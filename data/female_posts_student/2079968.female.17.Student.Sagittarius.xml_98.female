Secondly, if anyone wants a link to their weblog or website, let me know! I'll be glad to review the content and add it, as long as you link back to me! (In this, I'll create banners/buttons just in case).  Also, I'll be using a different service for comments...because the one I'm using now just isn't working out well. Idon't know if anyone has had problems...but I could have the new comment counter up today or possibly this weekend...(I'll most likely save all the old comments because I like them).  So that's it...If you have any suggestions or if you want a link to your page, just let me know. Comments are welcome!
