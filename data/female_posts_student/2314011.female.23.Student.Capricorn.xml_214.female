But the Boy put it best on his blog and it's been a while since I've stolen shamelessly from him, so here we go:   The huge summer adventure is approaching its conclusion. Two weeks full of insight and unexpected meetings, resolved conflicts, new beginnings, followed by the climactic Pride weekend in seattle with the gorgeous gay Idaho crew; it's a lot to digest.   Now we're at the part of the story where the heroes have achieved their mission, changed forever, and have only to complete the journey home to carry out the lessons they've learned. It's the bittersweet section, where you don't want it to end, but you know it can't go on; the part where you realize soon you'll have to deal with the dishes and laundry again. This is the point in every vacation where I wish more than anything that I had one more day...just one!  So that's what we've decided, the Girl and I. Leaving Seattle at 5 put us in Moscow at 10. She wasn't going to be any good at work on Monday. I would barely be able to move, let alone drive another 7 hours to Bozeman. So why even try? Why not just give ourselves what we both want and deserve: one more day of lounging, recovering, and recharging from our fantastic weekend of gay excess.  It really is the only thing to do, when you think about it. So we sleep in, make coffee, fondle the pile of new books we feel dirty for buying, and catch up on our AbFab. Nice way to wrap it all up, if you ask me.  As for the thrilling adventures, exotic new people, and dangerous car chases...it's coming. Just give me a few days to sort it all out.    Yeah.  Ditto.
