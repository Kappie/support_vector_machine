We divided into ten groups,each with around four section leaders and about six freshmen.And we had to come up with a team name and cheer. We were the Exploding Magnesiumites. And we started off at the side of the stage, and I climbed inside a box (I was the only one small enough, and considering I was around all freshmen that is kinda sad, but....) and crawled to the middle of the stage. So it was just a box slowly moving across the stage, mysteriously. Then..... BOOM! I popped out of the box and yelled "BOOM!" It was really funny. Then the rest of my team came out and cheereda lil chant-y thingie. And it was an all around good time.  But oh my.... it is kinda late and I got to getup early.... so adieu for now....  (I know this was a short, lame post.... but I have been kinda busy today.... my apologies)
