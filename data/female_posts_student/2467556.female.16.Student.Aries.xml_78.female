Owen Wilson is sooooooooooo adorable!!!!  I love him and his beautiful hair!!!  He was sooo sweet in that movie and generally every movie he's in!  Then they came over to spend the night and we had tons of fun while they got addicted to the Hangover Drops i got them while in Virginia.  Then today we walked to Quizno's for lunch and then went to the grocery store to read bridal/gossip magazines and look at the makeup aisle.  We soon discovered that the Tom Thumb was having some sort of cakewalk and if your number was picked then you got a free cake!  We decided to win this contest because we really wanted a cake.  So we had to wait 30 mins to play again and we passed this hot guy (that i didn't see right then! even though jess and britt knew he was there) and he was sticking toothpicks in these tomato slices......and i look over him and say "mmmmm tomatoes"....i honestly did not even see the guy!  Then it turns out that he's really cute and he looks over at us when i say that.  He probably thought i was checking him out when i honestly just wanted to eat a freaking yummy tomato!!  So yeah when we came back around after getting our makeup/magazines, he was all grinning at us and he told us numbers to stand on so we could win.  Then we missed the second round because Jess wouldn't listen to me.....so we ran all the way down the aisles to get there and we missed it.  Of course Kenneth, the tomato boy, was laughing at us.  So we asked him if we could eat the tomatoes and he let us have a bunch!  Then we walked back and decided we should probably buy our stuff before people start asking us to leave.  So we got all this gum because school starts tomorrow...about 12 packs.  Yes, there was a freaking hot guy as the cashier, just our luck! So he rings it all up and the three of us are trying to figure out how we're going to divide it up and pay for it.....and then all of the sudden the cashier, Kayden (what an adorable name!), starts pressing all these buttons and taking off all this money!  We're like what the heck are you doing!?!?!  We hand him our money ($24.01) and he says "No actually its $20.01" and we're like how did that happen?  He says "oh you know...*shrugs and grins*" He used his discount to take off money for us!!!  And its not like we didn't have enough money to pay!!  It was soooo sweet of him.  So we decided to give our numbers to these 2 guys because they completely earned it.  So we write a note to Kenneth with our numbers on it and leave it on his table with his tomatoes.  And we started to not give our numbers to Kayden.  So we "left" and i thought what if Kenneth doesn't see our note and some other creepy guy takes it!  So i went in there and asked him if he has seen our "eyeliner that we dropped".  He went around and looked for it with me even though it didn't exist!!!  Well i tried to lead him to the table, but i couldn't so i just picked up the note and handed it to him and said "this is for you, we weren't sure if you would find it there on the table....seeya".  He grinned and said "thanks!".  Then Brittany and Jess took FOREVER to get the number sheet to Kayden!  But eventually Jess walked up to him when he was leaving his NICE CAR and said "here!" and he was like "*grin* thanks!".  so that was a fun day!  Oh yeah and we didn't want Kayden to know that we walked to Tom Thumb, so we walked up to this random car and started acting like we were going to get in until he went in to the store before we started the walk back to my house to eat our german chocolate cake that we finally won in the cakewalk!  so awesome!!  We also came up with "Taking one for the team" points in which you must do something that benefits everyone like giving the phone numbers of everyone to a hot guy or carrying stuff a cake or giving a dollar to someone/being a good citizen.  Currently me and Jess are tied for the lead with 2 pts and Britty has 1.5 pts.    Sports Update: Stars have been kickin ass winning both their games against Vancouver (3-0) and St. Louis (3-1).  Who knows if my Niko played because i wasn't here to see those games, but if he was playing i'm sure he did well.  Stars play Calgary tomorrow at 8pm, we better win that game!  Here's the big story of the night!!!  My Coppell Hockey boys totally kicked ass in their Colorado Tourney...5-0-0 with spectacular wins over every team....so this must mean that every team sucks and we're the best in the region!!!  I think this says alot about our chances of winning state.  Do we go to nationals now?  Alright now its time for the wins:   First game: Coppell vs. Skyview Falcons (Montana)  Final score: 9-0 W First period score: 4-0 (4pts: Trey Snow - 1; Jimmy Hunter- 1; Ashcon Habibi - 2) Second period: 5-0 (1pt: Josh Heimbach -1) Third period: 9-0 (4pts: Josh Heimbach - 1, Trey Snow - 3) Notes: wow Montana hockey must suck.....and we only had 2 penalties the entire game and Montana had zero!  We outshot them 44 to 16 and this means that T.J. was brilliant between those pipes.  Trey Snow got a hat trick plus one goal.     Second game: Coppell vs. Taos Ice Tigers (New Mexico)  Final Score: 4-1 W First Period: 2-1 (2 pts: Josh Heimbach - 1; Adam Havens - 1) Second Period: 2-1 (no goals) Third Period: 4-1 (2 pts: Trey Snow - 1; Josh Heimbach - 1) Notes: TONS of penalties in this game! obviously this NM team was better at kicking ass than they were scoring goals.  lots of roughing, interference calls!  one misconduct for Jimmy Hunter.  We outshot them 27 to 11. Drinkwater was the star once again as goalie. 1 PPG for Taos and 2 for Coppell.   Third Game: Coppell vs. Desert Vista Thunder (Arizona)  Final Score: 8-3 W First Period: 2-1 (2 pts: Trey Snow -1, Jimmy Meyer - 1) Second period: 5-1 (3 pts: Trey Snow - 2, Mark Gillings - 1) Third Period: 8-3 (3 pts: Trey Snow - 2, Jimmy Meyer - 1) Notes: Not many penalties this game, 3 for Arizona and zero for Coppell.  Another Hat trick plus 2 more goals for Trey Snow, one goal short of getting 2 hat tricks in one game!!  This kid was rocking the ice rink!  At least this team kinda put up a fight against us by putting points up on the scoreboard. Ozowski played this game which is probably why 3 goals actually got in. One power play goal for Coppell in this game. Outshot them 61 to 24.   Fourth Game: Coppell vs. Monarch Hockey Club (Colorado)  Final Score: 1-0 W First Period: 0-0 Second Period: 0-0 Third Period: 1-0 (1 pt: Trey Snow at 3:08 into the third) Notes: It appears that this game was the one and only challenging game for Coppell of the entire tourney.  No goals in the first and second and then in the third Trey Snow saves the day by scoring a goal on a probably rare scoring chance with assists from Josh Heimbach and Ashcon Habibi.  3 penalties for Coppell and 1 for Colorado, probably a smart hockey low key game.  We outshot them 32 to 19 and the only goal was not a PPG.  Drinkwater was also the goalie for this game.     Fifth game: Coppell vs. Jackson Hole Beavers (Wyoming....wow i wouldn't want to play on this team)  Final Score: 3-2 W First Period: 2-1 (2 pts: Trey Snow) Second Period: 2-1 (no new goals) Third Period: 3-2 (1pt: Brandon Kukla - his first of the tourney) Notes: seems like this was a pretty tight game.  It got close at times....and it says on the site that it went into to OT but thats not what the game summary reflects.  Anyways, even though these people were from  Wyoming  and were called the  Beavers , it obviously didn't stop their play.  The penalty count was pretty average, most of them being the norm for Coppell.  Again we outshot them 33 to 18 and Drinkwater was also in goal.  Those goals had better been wicked awesome or there was a problem with Drinkwater.  1 PPG for Coppell and 0 for Wyoming.   ~~~ All in all, i think they did rather well throughout this entire tourney! Now Coppell has double games this week due to the rescheduling of the Marcus game that was supposed to occur on the Thursday of Spring Break!  We play Marcus on Tuesday at 7:30pm and Flower Mound on Thursday at 8.  Then we start playoff season!!!!!!  yaaaaay!!!  alright i gotta go!  Best of luck in starting school after spring break, ~~~Taylor~~~
