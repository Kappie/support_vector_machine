Well first off I had my ROR English test, 19 freaking short answer essay questions, I had to miss the first 45 minutes of my 2nd period class just to finish it. It took me abour 2 hours, 4 pages front and back, ahhh it was easy, but tedious. And now I have a 82 in english which I'm not happy about, nor am I happy about the 75 I made on my chem district assessment and the 61 on my Algebra 2 one, so yeah now I have 3 Bs and 5 As, ahhhh hopefully they'll go up some before the cut off tomorrow. I know I'm really hard on myself about grades, I seriously have to have like a 96 or above in each class. Oh well...The German test was pretty easy, though we all talked during it. And then I didn't know a word and I was like what the hell Mr. Smith, lol, that got some laughs. Will goes, "the language in this class has hit an all time low" or something like that, hey we all get away with it, so yeah I could care less. Rehearsal was boring as usual, Ms. Welch was on a rampage, so I couldn't listen to my cd player. The good thing is that for the first time in about 8 weeks I have no homework. I'm upset though, I just found out that my aunt, the one that I'm closest to has cancer, I hope she can get through it, all my family on my dad's side dies from cancer, so I'm scared for her, I don't want anything to happen to her :(. Well, I've got a headache and not really in a good mood, so I'm just going to go to bed. night   If there's nothing missing in my life, then why do these tears come at night?
