It's like were beginning to break. Not totally but just some parts of us begins to break in little pieces. I know that something might have changed in them but why like this? Is our friendship being tested by a big wall between us; a long road we need to cross before we see each other; or maybe a 2 different worlds we are in? I may be just insecure or something or maybe just got used being with her all the time/ most of it. But I just feel that she's flowing away/tearing apart or just moving away from me.What could this be? Is it just me or is it our bond is breaking?
