So if you would be willing to change it, I could find one that would suit your purposes. As for graphics, you'd have to pay the necessary $35 to upgrade to BLoggerPro, and it goes back to the regular $50 in a few weeks here...not that you care :) heh, o well. There's other sites that function like this one, such as  urlLink blurty.com , but it doesn't have a team function...on the other hand, you can design the layout  however  you want it. And since you won't do this because you're using this  for  the Team function in the first place, it's just a little more extraneous information that makes this site what it is:  A rant site.
