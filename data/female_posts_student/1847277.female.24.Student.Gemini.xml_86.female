I blame it on the fact that the lab alternated from stifling to freezing, which is just not good for the body.  The abdominator kinda kicked my ass today.  If I can actually make myself go to the two sessions a week I signed up for, I will certainly have wicked abs by the time it's all over.  Although I missed the first two weeks already.  Ah well.  We'll see how it goes.    I got home and felt yucky, which resulted in me laying down to take a nap at 8:15 and sleeping until 9:45.  Then I woke back up and after some inital grogginess (in which I made a sort of incoherent phone call to Matt), I ate some food and then was able to actually finish one of my article summaries for my presentation in geoarch on Friday.    If I can actually do my Creative Explosion presentation next week, I will be all set, having lots of time to focus on my prelim paper stuff.  And applying for funding, yippee.  I'm meeting with John on Thursday to try to get his opinion on what funding I should apply for and for which projects.  I also need to talk to him about what I should do this summer- ie, should I really try to go on a project in France or stick with Germany?  I mean, if the Montenegro and Israel things work out, I should be good in terms of real work for the summer, and it would be really nice to actually go back to a place for once, where I know the people and am semi comfortable with the place/language.  Although I already fear that the Serbian I am learning is pushing the German out of my head...  And have I mentioned in my blog that my cat will now actually play fetch?  For real.  What other cats play fetch?
