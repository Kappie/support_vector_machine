I have to add letters, symbols and numbers until my name has become so distorted that I'm sure I'll never again remember a sign in name creating a vicious cycle of sorts.  "What was my sign in again? Oh, forget it, I'll just create another one...what do you mean there is already a dddppaee77#!, damnit.."  The frustration is not limited to cyberworlds. Let's take my present educational situation, taking me from one venue to another over the course of the next year, what does this mean to you as a reader, well, it means that you are probably even more confused as to why this should matter so much.  I have to get new ID badges each time I move from one place to another, because god forbid the fact that I am first and foremost a student, and lastly a lowly scut monkey who is temporarily under the service of the hospital.  NO, it's imperative I have six different ID badges with my name presented in so many colorful block, and script letters in, did I fail to mention every morphed version of the spelling of my name...I have a simple name, not Joe or Ann, but i can only imagine what life must be like in the name game for these people, and well..I miss it...I even appreciate when my mother calls me by my full name, every consonant devoid of any underscores or extra P's...  You see this foils my plans for ever becoming famous, if someone ever mistakes my complaining and sarcasm for some brilliant work, they'll only know my pen name, which is a result of adding signs and characters until clicking on "Continue" takes you to the next screen.  It is nothing like the days of old when a pen name was representative of something a conjured pseudo-personality maybe, and well you would be able to write to them and request a manuscript for publishing.  They'll never be able to reach me because my e-mail address requires a graphing calculator to store the length of characters and pound signs.  Well, this was a hypothetical problem...very hypothetical, and hardly likely but I just miss my name..
