I love it...even though it is taking forever to load. If you hadnt noticed that my favorite key on the keyboard is the . key then you have noticed now...wait that made no sense...lol thats ok no one ever said I make sense, in fact no one ever says anything about me at all! ....well...wait thats not true...Maybe I should rephrase that...no one ever says anything good about me. there thats better. wow..god I am in a really bitter mood today. Not feeling to friendly. might have something to do with the pounding headache and sore throat I have. probably. oh and the fact that I didnt sleep very well last night cause i was on the most uncomfortable couch last night...I dont like victoria that much. well not when I go down there and end up not going anywhere fun, or that I wanna go.  please dont mind my complaining cause like I already I am feeling very bitter today. yup, actually I guess you could say thats an understatment. oh well. none of you's have to live with me. lucky you. ...-=I'm sorry that I hurt you, It's something I must live with everyday.=- thats a  really good song. I really do think I liketh more than I like more people. I dont like people. people and/or humans. and I cant decide if I dislike the female population more than the male population....or vice versa. I just basically hate them all. most of them. gaaar.....I feel like crying/killing something. maybe I should do both at the same time...only problem is I cant remember the last time I cried so I doubt I could make myself now...anywho, I have been typing alot these days...lets just blame it on the fact that I dont have a life. yes. thats a good idea.there everything is bold. whoop de doo. argh, I dont fucking care if the dumbass zelda game wasnt working before!! it isnt my fucking problem. stupid fucktards...sorry carrie mind if I borrow that word for today? I'm in need of it. anyways I think I should stop raving and go do something useful...wait I have nothing useful today!! so I will just go do something not useful....    Boo!.!
