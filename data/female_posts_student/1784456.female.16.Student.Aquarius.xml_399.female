I was just wondering because mine are the total oposit to me; Short and sweet!!!  i think that im just going to talk poo now, right here goes...Can you remember on friday when we were telling Lucy she smells, well my mum found out and i had to send her an appologetic email saying how i diddn't mean it, and that i was being influenced by the people that i had round at that time.  Why is my life so unfair.  I think its true what they say *LIFES A B***H AND THEN YOU DIE!*  Did you all see have I got news for you on friday it was not that brilliant, and what was Charlotte Church wearing?
