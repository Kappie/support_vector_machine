I decided to call Josh back first, so I did that only after about 3 minutes of being awake. We talked for awhile, and then I proceeded with my day. The day was very uneventful. I talked to Marty for a bit, and I'm pretty positive that things will be ok. I worked on my essay for school. Tomorrow I will be finishing some of it up, while also continuing with the rest of my homework. At about 8:30, Tommy called me and asked if I wanted to come over to his house and watch a movie. Having nothing else to do, I figured that it was ok. So I went over there for a little bit, and we watched a movie, and he tried to teach me again to play chess. He had tried once before, without success, and this time was no different. I just don't understand it! Oh well. So to summarize this whole stupid blog...today=boring...tonight=somewhat eventful.
