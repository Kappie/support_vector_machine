Yeay! Hmm cryptic poem aye? I'm still trying to figure out what it means. Poems just come to me, they aren't planned, I just write them. Fun! Wow, I can make millions by doing basically nothing! (Yeah, right) Hehe... maybe not, any way I have to gooo and have a shower now! Bi! (See only half of what I do all the time) Whatever. I recon some one should take the publish button of this page, it's turning every one apart from me crazy probably.
