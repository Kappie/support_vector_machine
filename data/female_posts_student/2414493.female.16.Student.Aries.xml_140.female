All the time I think of what I should write for next issue's column. I'm sure some would call that sick, but I think it's my personal space, and I might as well get somewhere with it. The key is direction. Any normal column/editorial won't do.   It says a lot about me, too. Writing LL has been about truths and communication and fatigue and school. A strange collection, yes. Does this tell me (or anyone, for that matter) that my brain is geared toward human interaction? success? or little petty desires easily fulfilled?  I don't know if I'm the only one who does this, but I take mental vacations all of the time. I was practicing and all I could think of was Indian culture--through E, and M, and reading Arranged Marriage. I used to write letters in my head running errands at Los Robles. I just have a strange imagination: I also have to quantify everything, and if something's random, I have to imagine slips of paper drawn out of a hat, etc.  end of thought. more later.
