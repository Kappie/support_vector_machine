And guess what my mum is... that's right! ... A FISH!!! *insert clever profession here more like* Uhh... no... I'm pretty sure that she's an Ocupational Therapist. Well... if you don't know what that is, go here:  urlLink http://www.occupationaltherapist.com/  Oh, anyway Exmoor was fun! It er -cough- didn't rain one speck... *it rained several large oceans instead* Don't worry... that didn't stop us from going on four 5 mile walks! *and they were uphill loads!* But hell, it was fun! *especially playing Happy Familys, I won!* Hehe... and due to our rutheless Pontoon betting, I won a load of Skittles! MUHAAHAAA! Not that I let it go to my head ;) And not that Izzy won everything else... oh, and not that she's overly OVERLY obsessed with her boy friend Pete. *sigh* It's tough being stuck with some one like that... kidding kidding, it was loads of fun! Woohoo, London on Tuesday! Don't worry, I'll be back on Saturday if you miss me.
