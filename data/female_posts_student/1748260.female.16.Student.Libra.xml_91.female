Kawaii kor... only stayed for 1 service.. but never mind.. will be seeing kawaii kor soon.. maybe next Saturday... How about my everdearest cutie da jie? Sigh.. gotta wait til June. Have not been seein' her online either...JIEEEEEE IF U'RE SEEIN' THIS I MISS U LIKE CRAZY!!!!! Then my ah Hui  Fang mei also dunno where they chabut to already...oh yes.. back to the details for the day.. Went with kawaii kor to 7 eleven after the 8am service.. Then went back to 10.30 service... Jen-o never come again!! I'm juz so sad.. everybody seems to be backsliding..After service we went to Marina Square to eat. Some took bus.. I took You Xin's car!!! Cas..Joanne  Ro was on the car too. Some others took Beng Huat's (dunno how to spell his name..unsure whether it's correct) car.. while some took bus  Benson rode his motorbike. Guess what? We thought Benson would be the first to arrive. Upon arriving, You Xin called Benson's handphone  he picked up saying he had some accident. Then Jeremiah's group arrived ... the group which sat on Beng Huat's car...well Jeremiah called Benson's handphone too. Benson said he had some concussion.. couldn't really remember what happened before hand  actually called Amy  said "Is today Good Friday?" Well... guess he had a shock. Ok.. we bought our food. I ate Ban Mee.. the famous Qiu Lian Ban Mian stall :D .. After that..I drank my Justea Ice Tea with Lemon..  after we makan finish.. we left for the hospital. This time I sat in CJ's car... together with Cas. O yea..  Ro too..but she followed CJ to meet some VFC people I think..Few of the youths were at the hospital.. waiting to see Benson.. as the crazy nurse was like "ONE PERSON AT A TIME PLEASE.. NOT TOO MANY AT ONCE" we were like what? Haiz.. never mind then... we waited long.... Benson had to have stitches on his face  a bandage around Benson's fractured arm. Soon after he came out...we prayed for Benson  Amy sent Benson home. Well.. the different groups of us.. we went our separate ways. I wanted to go out walk walk with certain people... but felt that I might be extra..  I could not do much since I left my cash at home. I decided to go home halfway. BUT... I fell down halfway  it was like few cuts on my right leg  swelling on my left hand. The rest saw me  came over. I took 2 plasters from Cas.. thanks girl... :)... alrights.. after that I walked back to Outram Park MRT station  went home.. now HERE I AM!
