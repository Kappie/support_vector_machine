When Jerm got home last night we went to get groceries and grabbed a to go package of premade sushi along with our veggies. When we got home and ate, it was so good that we decided to go out to the sushi place on Lake Merritt. We had a couple of beers and ate yummy sushi, except for one that we didn't like. I remembered that I like flying fish roe better than salmon roe. It was like a date or something, and we chatted and held hands and were generally romantic. Very nice.   Now I'm trying to clear out the front bedroom, but I keep moving in fits and starts, doing a job, then going to another, not really finishing everything. The good thing is that Jerm cleaned out the closet, so I finally have a place to put all of my clothes, which is very exciting. Next we need to build the bed and set up the computers and get my dresser in and we'll have a functioning room! I think I might turn it into laundry sorting central to allievate the burden on the back bedroom, which is really overwhelmed with stuff.  Oh well, back to work.
