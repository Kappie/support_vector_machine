I was pissed about the Fugliest Rock Star thing -- they said Chad Kroeger was fugly, and I don't really think he is but I guess you could see it that way, but THEN they tried to tell me that Sully Erna (Godsmack) was fugly!  He is  NOT  fugly.  He's pretty damn sexy if you ask me, but maybe it's just b/c I like that type... Tatoos, piercings, slightly demonic appearance...  But anyway.. .  I got up at 8:30 yesterday and other than getting up to get a glass of water, take some ibuprofen, get the phone, or go to the bathroom, I didn't get up until 6, and that was only to go plant my ass on my bed instead.  I slept for like... 5 hours during the day, then I went to bed at 9:30 and didn't wake up until 11 this morning... YAY!  But I'm starting to feel better.  I was actually able to eat last night.  My dad brought me home stuff from Noodles at 8ish, and I ate almost the whole thing, and the only reason I stopped was b/c it made me full (Tues all I ate was 15 little seashell noodles and a small piece of cantelope, Weds all I'd eaten before the Noodles was 3 olives and 2 pieces of cantelope...).  And I'm actually able to go 5 or 6 hours w/o taking more ibuprofen, instead of wanting to take 4 every 4 hours...  And now I can drink a glass of water/iced tea in 15 mins instead of 2 hours or not at all...  So yeah, I see it as an improvement.  I'm actually going to go to play prac tonight, both b/c I think I feel up to it and b/c I've already missed three and I don't want to miss any more.  If people are gone I'm not sure how long I'll be able to read their parts for b/c talking/laughing/etc. for extended periods of time makes my throat hurt more.  But anyway, after prac. I'll probably end up going to the party at Robert's, although I don't think I'll drink.  If Beth even brings the alcohol, b/c she told me she wasn't really sure she was going to.  I def. won't do the beer bong b/c that's shraing of germs and I don't want to make anyone sick.  No spin-the-bottle for me either...  Oh well...  Anyway, I have some more I want to write about but I'll do that later or tomorrow.
