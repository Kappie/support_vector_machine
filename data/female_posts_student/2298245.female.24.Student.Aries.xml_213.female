I decided to watch Masterpiece Theatre instead, for the next part of The Forsyte Saga.  And I was not disappointed.  It was a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed it a lot.  So I can't wait for the next part.  That's all for now, because I just gushed about it with a friend, so the rest of you get spared my blathering on about it.  But it was good, and everyone should watch.
