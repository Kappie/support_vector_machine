I get in trouble a lot, still, with my sarcasm i use with my parents. I can't help it, its like second nature now. Anyways. I really dont have much to complain about now that i have a boyfriend (of about 7 months now) so yeah. He keeps me in check with reality, but i still have many secrets and hidden darkness that i dont think even he knows...  Just personal pain, torment. Self-image isn't a problem. Self-esteem, yeah, but that's always an issue. Just secrets i hold to myself...but...yeah...  I'm starting to get fed up with everyones Bull Crap about my BF. They complain to me about things they dont like about him, instead of telling him. Everyone has their faults, so i dont know why they cant get past that. Then again...sure. W/e, i'll just leave it at that. Its summer, i should be happy. And i am, but i'm not...just a mix i guess. guess that's all for now. hopefully i'll post here more often. but who knows.
