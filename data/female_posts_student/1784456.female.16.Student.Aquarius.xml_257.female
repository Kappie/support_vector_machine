It keeps not showing Tahoma font when I try to type with it on Microsoft Word. I'm also doing this essay on volcanoes and I don't know if it's supposed to be in by tomorrow! Whoops! I think this computer doesn't like me... Maybe if I kick it a little. Bad idea. Last time I did that the monitor cut out! Ahh, back to school tomorrow! Hey when's the day when we're going in later and stuff? Better check the school website. Mmm guess what? It's all in white! Noooo! I haven't actually done any of my hw! Guess I can't be as bored as some people! Check out  urlLink http://www.nailseatrials.co.uk/indexi.html  because...I actually know who some of these people are! (Yeah right) Plus I'm bored and hey, I'm gonna go watch Stig of the Dump! *groan*
