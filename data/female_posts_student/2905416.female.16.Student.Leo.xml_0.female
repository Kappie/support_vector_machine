God, I don't even know why I am doing this, no one'll ever read it, and even if they did, they'd die of boredom... I spose I'm doing this because I made a new years resolution to keep a diary, and seeing as I hate writing, I decided to put it on the computer, then decided that it would be better on the internet, where everyone could marvel at my great diary-entering skills.   Anyway, back to the library; I plan on getting Money, By Martin Amis, His dark materials series, coz I figure anyone who is anyone has read those, so I spose if I want to be 'anyone' I should probable read them. Then there's the Strange incident that happened in the night time, by some guy who was in the review...they said it was good, so i spose it must be. *shrugs* No matter how hard I try not to conform, I'm still influenced by societys pop culture...woe is me!   Tomorrow it's school again...*yawn*. I have diagnosed myself with 'Chronic Boredom' due to the fact that, no matter how hard I try, nothing seems to interest me...I spose it's hard to explain...I do alot of musical stuff, play the violin and oboe, am a member of many groups and choirs, but I still seem to be bored...even going out with friends bores me...mabye I'm just a boring person...or everyone else is boring...   Ah, well, let's not dwell on the negative, but the partially positive! Music, of course, is one of my favourite things. Favourite bands include The Darkness, Coldplay, The Strokes, Metallica, Jet, Oasis, Rammstien etc...pretty much anything rock/alternative! I despise pop, except Robbie Williams, and...I must admit, I own Brittneys 1st album and 3 of her singles...But, I must also add, they were all given to me, I didn't buy a single one! Mabye I give off an aura of poppiness...urg!  I also enjoy listening to John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Pete Murray and The Whitlams.   Reigning champion of of round the table table tennis championships and one A of a double A battery!   Sorry, just had to add that!   One for me, one for my homies. Respect.
