Wellllllllllllllll, like you said Matt, today we had a lovely sub in History, so not much happened this morning during first period, but we did watch some very interesting documentaries about WWII. In Music Theory we reviewed for the test and then sang some excerpts from  Carmina Burana,  this time with the recording we did last week during Band (I've never played an instrument and sung at the same time!). And in English, we had a wonderful essay test on  Grapes of Wrath,  for which I wrote six full pages and took me over two hours. And that's only part one! Joy. But I must say it again, the ending to that book was GNARLY as fuck. I'll never get over it, I swear. So the busybody bitch that I got into an accident with yesterday called my house THREE times today and left TWO messages on the answering machine. The total damage comes to $126 after she simply went to her dealer and had the plastic on the bumper replaced. How absolutely devastated she must be. Bitch. I'm delighted that you behaved so well in front of my mother today, Matt. She thinks you're a (")good kid.(") That's just SWELL!! Let's just canonize you, ya little bastard! Well, I'm looking forward to tomorrow in Physics, Matt, on the condition that you remember to bring your digital camera. We have big plans for this here blog of ours. Can't wait to start snapping some photos and making a real layout, baby.
