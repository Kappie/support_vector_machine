Hmm, always little... Lolz.  I am a tetiary student now studying for a Diploma.  I am a small (little) sized girl who stands only about 156cm tall. I am very particular about my weight though. I must maintain weight below 47kg or 48kg at least. I am a little girl, who often smiles, not that I am crazy. I believe that smile makes it all. Highly Contagious. I did not realise about this until my friend told me that she often see me smiles, and she felt comfortable.  Well, I have my fierce moments also. Hahaz, ask my sisters!! I am also a girl who may get worry very often, but thanks to friends around with advises and calm.   And my religion. I am a little follower of Jesus Christ, still learning to follow his ways, and spread the Good News.  Though sometimes temptations led me away from God.   I am a girl learning to be independent, strong and brave.
