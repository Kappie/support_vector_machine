But the cracks were always there. Actors playing their parts, worthy of awards. Their costumes hiding the reality of lies which filled their words. But I played my role as well... In search of great reviews until the day my mask was removed. Now forced to face this hell with reality at my feet. The pain is all I feel. The actors weren't acting. The stories were all real. This stage  is  damaged. The actors...not so great. They lie, hurt and cheat. Guess they were acting just like me.
