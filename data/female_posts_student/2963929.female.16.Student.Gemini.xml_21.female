Never try to forget someone by making yourself drunk, it makes you more miserable (unless you are drinking those alcoholic drinks with at least 60% of alcohol, which you will just go unconsious immediately). I've wasted alot of money to buy those 5% alcoholic drinks which have no effect on me until the fifth to sixth bottle.          Never cut yourself with a pen knife and bleed to forget someone. Even if you bleed to death he or she won't come back to you. Mine doesn't leave any scars at all!!! If it does, it will remind you of that someone everytime you looked at the scars.        Don't bother to read my previous blog, it was already a history which i don't wish to remember any of it.
