[good thing im not jill or i woulda taken about 2 hours to get ready] I worked until 1...if you can call that work.  After 9:30 we close down and clean and all i hadta do was clean the lobby so i hung out with everyone else or read The House of the Spirits--finished.  Left around one when Josh came and took over.  What did i do when i came home?  Yeah i def. fell right asleep for 3 hours! I was still pretty exhausted from saturday + sore. Then i woke up and...*tries to remember last night* I dont know, had yummy spaghetti, watched more track + field and swimming and played Jill's new CDs--which i needta remember to burn b4 she goes to Boston.  Well ive got a while since she doesnt start school until SEPTEMBER 7th!! Not fair...  TONY's COMING HOME AUGUST 10th--my first official day of school.  This should be interesting...
