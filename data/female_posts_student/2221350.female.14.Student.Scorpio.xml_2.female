But then, do i EVER have a week that's not a shitpile?  Saturday was a blast. Me tiffany, Brandon, and Rick. We couldn't go bowling because all the lanes were taken so we went and saw cheaper by the dozen. It was a stupid movie, but the people i was with were a blast and we were wild.  so Monday was shitty. i STILL have finished the goddam motherfucking bitchwhore powerpoint project. It was a normally crappy day until mom picked me up from guitar lessons acting like a fucking idiot who dropped some bad acid. She swerved all over the road, honked at cars for no reason, would NOT quit calling Steven and yelling SONOFABITCH, and scared the shitt out of me. So after a lot of yelling and swerving, i grabbed the wheel and managed to get us home. She staggered into bed and when she woke up a few hours later she ran out of her room and said "DID SOMEONE GO GET CAITLIN?!". Well after some picking her brain we concluded that she was mad at Steven and her blood sugar was so low from taking too many diet pills that she doesn't even remember the entire afternoon. It was a really fucked up thing and she didn't even apologize until i squeezed it out of her.  so today i went into school and worked on my monologue some more and I'm still not done and Ms. morehead made me say my monologue and then didn't make anyone else say theirs. i hate her and i want to wring her scrawny wrinkly stupid neck.  I've pretty much decided that i hate everything.  so I've noticed that in the afternoons momma is obnoxious and stupid... Almost drunk acting... But she says she's not drinking...  you know, the only time I'm with my mother and she's not all fucked up is when she takes me to school in the mornings. That's before she's had a diet pill, a chance to drink, a meeting with Steven, or been to the tanning bed. It makes me sad.   I've decided I'm not going to capitalize my entries anymore((except for when the blogger spellcheck gets it)). It takes too long and it doesn't matter anyway.  so tonight she was being her usual idiot obnoxious self and she told me to go wash the dishes that won't fit in the dishwasher which really makes me mad because the ONLY-ONLY-ONLY-ONLY-ONLY job mammaw has is to wash the dishes that won't fit in the dishwasher and I'm so stressed most of the time it wouldn't have killed someone else to do it. So when i brushed it off and continued typing she came in here and clicked away my entire foot long email and closed all of AOL and it really makes me want to hit her hard in the face when she is so dumb and immature she can't even tell me to do the dishes without fucking up something in my life. But i DID do the bitchwhore dishes and i DID retype the email and she finally went to bed so i can be at peace. And YET STILL i am not at peace because as i was feistily washing dishes she said to me "if you kill yourself  I'll kill myself too and haunt you forever".... Ok... So now I'm not even safe to kill myself. What else is there to do when instead of tenderly dissuading me she THREATENS me. shitpissfuckshitpissfuckshitpissfuck  so concludes my shitpile week, which is yet another layer of my shitcake life, the icing on this shitcake being the fact that i am only 14 years old and already my spirit is broken. It's not dormant or depressed or temporarily out of service, it's shattered into tiny pieces that embed themselves into my skin and drive me mad. i hate this.
