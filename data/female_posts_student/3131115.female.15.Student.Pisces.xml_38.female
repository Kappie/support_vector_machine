I miss all of them so much. I'm really not as happy as I make myself sound. Well, atleast not now. Fuck..I'm so lonely. I need to stop, I really do...:'( I dont know what the hell to do. I'm...grrr. I shouldnt feel this way. Like, I get so jelous because Ashley's ex boyfriend and her are talking..and I shouldnt. I REALLY shouldnt be getting jelous. Besides..it probably makes her feel shitty when she sees me with Bill. I feel so bad..I dont know what to do. AHH! :'( Im so sorry. For all that I've done..I'm SOO sorry!
