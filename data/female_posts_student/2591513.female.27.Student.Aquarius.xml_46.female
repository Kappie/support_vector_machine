They were amazed because the top fuundraisers were al male and Bailey was the only one kind enough to include one female.  I am so proud of him.  He is such a treasure, the greatest gift from God.  That is all I have to say tonight.  I have so much homework to do that I haven't done yet.  UGH.  Procrastination is a bad bad habit I wish I didn't fall victim to.
