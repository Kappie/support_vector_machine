I'm also one of the few(and proud)geeky anime fans at school(though Daniel would never call himself as geeky and obsessive as me in anime).  In short, ANYONE please play with me!  My account on Ragnarok Online is called Lady Capulet (The name of ultimate geekiness i know).  My account on Gunbound is called Erline.  Help!
