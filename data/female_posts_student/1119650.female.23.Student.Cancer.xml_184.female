I'd show those lil rapscallions that depends are what the cool kids wear.  Yeah A.A.R.P!  It is *SO* amazing outside today.  Im trapped in the building until 4, but in a scant 2.5 hours I'll be free!  I will frollick in the park with my poochie, Sahara.  Woo Hoo!  I urge you all to open the windows or go outside and let the stink blow off.  It might make ya feel a lil better!  Oh and in case you didn't get the memo: its the FREAKIN' WEEKEND!  And Finally:  urlLink Roly Poly  has just opened within walking distance of my house.  I am so VERY VERY stoked about this.  "w00t".  Who wants to come over for wraps  a walk to the beach??
