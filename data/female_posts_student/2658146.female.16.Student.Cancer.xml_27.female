And being the fun-loving person I am, I was the one who threw it.  Big mistake . I'm not throwing another party until graduation. Anyway, I found out that day that I have three less friends than I thought I did. So here's what happened:  My brother is a moron. But we all knew that already. Anyway, Pa was out shopping for snacks and such (that he was supposed to have had done already) and Zack comes downstairs looking for him, which he  knew  he wasn't supposed to do. Being the annoying spastic child he is, we (my "friends" and I) are quickly annoyed by him, and thusly Brett gets the bright idea to ducktape his hands behind his back and his mouth shut. So he's kicking and jumping and struggling while Lane, Drew, and I are trying to hold him down. Naturally, we decide to tape his feet too. Drew isn't exactly gentle with Zack, and his head gets banged on the floor. And so he cries. And cries. And cries some more. And it wasn't because it hurt (he told me so himself after all was said and done). And he's still crying when Pa gets home so I get grounded (but not before I get into a huge argument with him).  So now my brother hates me more (if that's possible), I get into an argument with Pa (oh fun), and I'm embarrassed out of my eyeballs in front of my friends as I'm grounded into what seems like an eternity. But that's not why I'm mad. Na, the worst part was that I didn't get   ONE FUCKING APOLOGY  . From any of them. Some friends they turned out to be. So now I'm down to five friends (more like four friends and one boyfriend, we have yet to see how this turns out...). It goes from nine to five in one event. Sortof. Noodle never showed up, nor did she give me any notice whatsoever that she wasn't going to show up. I have an idea of why, but I still need to talk with her about it. But it's not like me and her are really close friends anyway.  I'm trusting fewer and fewer people nowadays. I'm keeping more and more secrets. Not other people's secrets (well, I do, but that's not what I'm talking about). I'm going back to how I used to be. A sour, mean, and friendless hermet. But at least that way I wouldn't havve to expect anyone to  attempt  to befriend me. What excellent friends I have.  P.S. To my still-existing friends (currently Monica Ginny Genell Ryan and Dave), I lurve you all and none of the above insults and/or complaints are meant to be directed at you. You all still rock.
