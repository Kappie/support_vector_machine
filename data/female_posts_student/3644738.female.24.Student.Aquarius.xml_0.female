Neither of my parents were born here so I am first generation, which makes the whole assimilation impossible! However I cannot say with passion and confidence that I am an African because (this will probably sound like the most twisted mess you ever heard but) I can't relate to my own people.  I went over there in 2001 and to cut a long story short I was supposed to stay for 3 weeks but came back "HOME" after 2.  I would have been back sooner but there is only 1 flight a WEEK!! I felt like the "ginger haired step-child" when I was out there because I stuck out like a sore thumb and everywhere I went people where like "Ah this nah American woman" or "How de body English Woman"  Hey, some people even referred to me as being White!!!!!  Everything about the place was so alien to me, social order, the city's infrastructure, the mindset of the people and the saddest thing was the poverty! On a comical aside: You know what I said prior about not feeling British...Well when the plane landed I said to myself "God Save The Queen  All That"  (Best said in a Cockney accent (if you don’t know what I’m talking about watch 2 minutes of “Eastenders” on BBC America).  It was definitely an experience I'll never forget .....I'm a better person for it!!  I'm so THANKFUL for what I have and I'm not talking about material possessions, technological advancements etc ..... But OPPORTUNITY!! Something the majority of Sierra Leoneans do not have!!
