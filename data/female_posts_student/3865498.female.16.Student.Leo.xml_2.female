Like B today, she expected me to be able to go over and watch a movie with her and LA and O. But I'm sorry, I wouldn't be ready in time to go over there and watch the whole movie before LA and O had to be picked up. My mom offered to drive LA and O home since LA can't drive O since she's not legal yet, but I guess my plan wasn't good enough. And I'm sorry, but if I am going to watch a movie, I'll want to see the whole thing. And now B is like pissed because she has less than two weeks here in our hometown before she goes off on a trip with her family... ok its 2 weeks, thats a long time, and packing doesn't take that long. There's 10 more nights that we can watch movies, tonight just wouldn't work out. I just can't believe she expected me to be able to...she like assumed... and if she gets really mad over this, then...I don't know, it'll be ridiculous. BAAAAHHHH! and LA asked even if I couldn't go over there, I'd still have time to hang with G, right? And I thought, oh thats nice of her to think of that, but when I was in the shower, it occured to me that B might have asked her to say that to see if I was ditching them or whatnot... but maybe I'm being paranoid... probably that. Ok I think dinner is close to being ready. Maybe will write later.    Love   ME
