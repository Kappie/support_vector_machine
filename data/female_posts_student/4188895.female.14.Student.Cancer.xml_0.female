But they wouldn't let us because we didn't make a "Reservation". So we walked all that was for nothing! Gr. I don't know if they did but they were forced to call the police if we didn't get off the campus. But that was ok because Mrs. Shelling let us use the phone and get a drink. So ha. Middle schoolers suck. :P So we casue the Alex bus to my house and here we are! Anyways, woh....There's a little note on the computer desk saying " Pat + Jaye Larsen...and then an e-mail and a number. But i'm not gonna tell you cause you'll call them...Maybe...Ok, that's enough typing. Laters!
