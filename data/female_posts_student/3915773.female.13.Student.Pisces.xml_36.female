The way that the New York Times decided that the "former leader" Jiang Jemin was still in power was through the Chinese media. They noted:     "BEIJING, July 14 -- With bold front-page headlines and top billing on the main television news show, China's state media announced this week that Jiang Zemin, the country's military chiet, had visted the northern city of Sheyang and called on troops there 'to master revolutionary theory"  According to the times this is "standard fare for the CommunistParty-controlled media".Therefore itdoes not seem any different froma normal event and normally would not show that this man is still in power. But the event that the mediain China reported on occured 13 years ago. This means that Jiang is a significant enough figure to bereported on 13 years after an event happens.    The media report on Jiang shows heis a powerful figure. With this it showshow powerful the media is. The NewYorkTimes only realized how powerful Jiang might be after the media ran a story on him. The people at the Times know that media coverage on eventssuch thatreported inChinais a significant indicator of power.
