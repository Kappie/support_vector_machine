Went to watch HellBoy  A very entertaining movie... It's much longer than I expected; over 2 hours..  And we did not go dutch this time! Don just got his humble pay from the army... hehez...    2. Went shopping  Saw this really cool pair of 'supalow' jeans at Giordano. I had wanted to buy it through Judy for the 20 percent staff discount. However I was not able to contact her, thus will have to keep it under KIV. It is a great buy for 50 bucks,  after the 20% discount it will be a killer buy! Love the color too, sort of a replica of tab1 Levi's..  Don bought me a halter top from B.U.M. Very pretty one with rainbow stripes and a adjustable strap in front.. Cheap too... only costs 15 buckeroos.. One more to add to my wardrobe..  Yippee!=p   3. A walk at the esplanade  This is the highlight of my weekend... Me and Don shared a really special evening taking a walk down the esplanade.. There was a band playing and they sounded fantastic. The lead singer sounded alot like Tom Jones.. Really sexy.. =p  We spent a wonderful time just chatting, enjoying the breezy weather.. It has been so hot lately, thank god for cooler evenings..  Shared lemonade together bought from one of those mobile food vans..  He was wearing what I like too, checkers short sleeve shirt with jeans and sneakers... I know he hates to wear shirts, and that he is wearing that for me.. I appreciated that.. =)  I told him that the espanade was my solace, a place where I have many many fond memories of.. Most with my best pal, and also my other mates too... He nods his head and listens.. smiles...  We talked about our future He told me how many kids he wants and where he intend to go for our honeymoon.. Which country he is bringing me to for our first holiday trip when he starts working... Haha.. call me a dreamer for planning too early, but I think I'm too much in love to know rationality..  Ah.. bless.. I love lemonade!
