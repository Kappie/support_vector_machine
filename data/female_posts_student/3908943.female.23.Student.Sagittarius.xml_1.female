He should do that more often because ever since that day we've had gorgeous weather. It's very rare for July/August, so I'm enjoying it as much as possible. I know it can't last forever, so got to make the best of it now. Too bad it can't be like this year-around. But then again I love snow too, so I tend to only like the fall and winter seasons. Only reason I like summer is for vacations and baseball. I spend too much time hanging out with guys.   I've been emailing my roommate from senior year non-stop it seems. We're playing catch-up (told you this was a catch-up summer) because we don't get to talk to each other much. Funny how her dramas are not that dissimilar from mine. Maybe that is why our friendship has lasted so long. Then again my best friend here and I are completely at different ends of the spectrum, and we've been friends even longer.   When you think about it, why do you stay friends with the people you do? Do you attract people who are just like you or opposite of you? I tend to attract friends nowadays that are neck-deep into politics (not me), love things like rollercoasters and flying (not me), and/or other things that I won't mention (but aren't me either). Yet I love them to death, and would do anything for them - as I do and would for those I've known for pretty much all my life. I do know thatall my friendsare caring people who bust their butts for their friends, are trustworthy, and would be there when you need them. Those things are the qualities I look for in friends - those are what reallycountin the end.
