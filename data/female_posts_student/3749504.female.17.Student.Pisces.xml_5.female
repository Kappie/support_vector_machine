I'm 17 years old, going to be a high school senior next fall. When I go to college, I'm going to major in history / political science. I love reading, writing, playing video games, going to the theater, soccer, swimming, blahblah...flamingoes. I do love flamingoes.  So, I am off to find some decent people on this site (I certainly hope you people aren't as wonderfully dull as the people at Blurty, especially the ones who are on happy drugs and have three kids and are 16).
