If you see a sunset and try and describe it to someone in normal words, all you can say is, 'Boy, I saw a great sunset last night.'  But if you are a poet, you give it to someone to feel for themselves.  Like you make a little seed of what you saw, they swallow it, and it blooms again inside their own heart."-Elizabeth Berg  "Katryna had an epiphany this fall.  While driving through post peak Massachusetts on her daily route, she noticed a hillside, all brown and gold, autumn's faded palette.  And she realized with surprise that she actually preferred what we call 'post peak' to the traditional 'actual peak.'  See, 'actual peak' involves a whole spectrum of anxiety: 'is it peak yet? is it now?  Wait, I think I still see some green over there, so it can't be peak, but look, that maple is balding fast, and maybe I missed it after all!'  Once we're in post peak, the fall proceeds in a stately, gradual manner, and by the time the last leaf has fallen, we are serenely resigned to the state of affairs.  It's a nice time.  We miss out on the leaf gazing, mountain climbing frenzy and trade that in for crackling fires and the anticipation of snow days."-Nerissa Nields  "I collect and wear Mickey Mouse watches. This past fall, I boarded the train to New York at Metropark, in Woodbridge, N.J.  At one of the stops, a boy about 5 entered the train with his mother.  As the train was crowded, they sat next to me, the boy on his mother's lap.  He noticed my watch, and looked up at my face. He repeatedly glanced at the watch, then at me, as though working out a difficult problem.  Finally, with a very puzzled expression on his small face, he tapped me on the arm and said, 'Excuse me, but are you a grown-up?'"-Lollie W. Margolin, "Metropolitan Diary",  The New York Times   "A poem begins in delight and ends in wisdom."-Robert Frost
