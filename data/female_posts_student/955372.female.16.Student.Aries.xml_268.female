But it was to hard to make it a man so we gave it a skirt. And i'm like "oh mom lets make it a transvesite and we can name it cher!" and she goes "no, i don't want 'new york city night life'" and i was like "psht fine" so then i'm like "well we should give her a name" and mum's like "lets name her rosemary raisin because her face is made with raisins and her arms and hair are rosemary twigs" (i know i know, rosemary raisin...) and i'm like "well can we at least make her middle name cher" so rosemary  CHER  raisin was born. well sort of, because no matter what mum says it is still the transvestite snowman named cher.
