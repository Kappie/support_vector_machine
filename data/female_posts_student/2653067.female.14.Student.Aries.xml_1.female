Let us think of a subject to speak about..  Ah yes, the school.   SDSS has had a fantastic renovation and it's nice that the 1500 students at SDSS are under one roof and don't have to go back and forth inbetween the North and South but things are getting insane.  The school is now over crowded because everyone is "under the same roof".  The halls are especially crowded.  In the halls, there are people standing at the sides, getting stuff from their lockers, people standing right in the middle of the halls talking about god-knows-what and people trying to get through at the same time.  I've already lost a lunch to this over crowding.  I don't mean that I threw up or anything.  This is what I mean by "lost a lunch": Last Wednesday, I bought a BLT and Cesar salad from the caf at my school.  I was walking out of the caf and then this Bastard kid nammed Michael Chang Ran into me, knocked the B out of my BLT and didn't say sorry.  He stood there for a minute, looked at the B on the floor, turned around and walked away.  Grrr.  That BLT cost me $3!!   *Forms a gun with fingers and Shoots the kid*.   But thanks to the kid and the over crowding of my school, I have lost the B of my BLT and had to eat a LT instead.     Note to readers-I got my idea to write about this from reading one of  urlLink Vanessa 's posts
