I keep getting like these sharp pains through my stomach.  I didn't even eat breakfast today and for lunch I just had a slushie and well for supper I had some chicken nuggets.  I shouldn't have eaten though.  I started to feel better until I ate supper and put some food in my stomach.  I also threw up this morning but I still went to school.  I didn't want to miss school because I don't need to miss math because I already don't understand it as it is and well I didn't want to miss the chem test.  I am really annoyed with the math teacher right now.  I am not too pleased.  I admit at times she can really help and be nice but I don't understand this certain stuff and I keep telling her I don't get it, but like she keeps ignoring me.  I told her today I was like "I don't really understand this" and she was like "well it takes to long to explain that so I will explain it later."  She never has enough time for anything or anyone.  She doesn't get it.  Like I DON'T understand!!!!  And ignoring the fact that I don't "get it" isn't going to make anything better.
