Who can ask for better friends than Amirah, Mandy, Chin Ming, Atiqah and Aishah? No one!       Although my birthday has already gone by, or if you prefer, haven't come, they had given me so many surprises today!  They came here to celebrate my birthday today! And they ordered pizza! But the best time were the presents. Atiqah got me a rainbow colored star keychain from Gifts D'Lite, while all five of them chipped in to buy me a Marik Structure Deck! Oh, I just loved them all!!! Aishiteru, my friends!!! Not in a gay way though, get your mind out of the gutter, Eva!     Aishah's birthday is on August 7th, we should start preparing too... hmm, I wonder what she would like, maybe a CD? Or some romance books?     I know Chin Ming wants a Yuna model, I think we can all contribute some money to buy it. Amirah, Mandy and Atiqah, I think they'll like sweets and chocolate. Mandy especially wants chocolates from the Cocoa Tree...    I'm soooo full, due to the pizza! Awww, I have to do my homework now... WAIT!!!! I still haven't told my mom about my English Common Test grades!!! MOM!!!!
