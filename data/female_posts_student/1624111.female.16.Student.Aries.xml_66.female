Please tell me you're just feeling tired cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break out of touch, out of time. Please send me anything but signals that are mixed casue I can't read your rolling eyes out of touch, are we out of time?  Close lipped another goodnight kiss is robbed of all it's passion, your grip another time, is slack it leaves me feeling empty.  Please tell me you're just feeling tired cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break out of touch, out of time. Please send me anything but signals that are mixed casue I can't read your rolling eyes out of touch, are we out of time?  I'll wait until tomorrow maybe you'll feel better then maybe we'll be better then so what's another day when I can't bear these nights of thoughts  of going on without you? this mood of yours is temporary it seems worth the wait to see you smile again out of the corner of your eye wont be the only way you're looking at me then.** "Again i go unnoticed"-Dashboard Confessional  hmmm....especially that last verse... "Please tell me you're just feeling tired cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break...i'll wait until tomorrow. Maybe you'll feel better then, maybe we'll be better then. So whats another day? when i cant bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you... This mood of yours is temporary. It seems worth the wait to see you smile again." pretty much everything but the kissing part... sigh... so much fear and hoping in desperation...  please tell me this is just me being moody...
