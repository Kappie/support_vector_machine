Mother and I took the HOV-HOMO lane into work this morning and almost died a few times as we hit puddles of water that almost slammed us into the side walls.  Very scary. Needless to say, I arrived at work with no makeup and my hair standing on ends (I was driving...).  I am excite about going to Austin today.  And I am even more excited about going to San Marcos as well - granted it will be raining I am sure. It will just be nice to hang out with my new family and spend some time with them. Mother made jello shots last night (about 100) and I think the blackberry flavored as lethal. (May have to sample one just to make sure.)  Yesterday, I spent most of my day listening to Bob Schneider's newest cd online.  It's such a great album.  Jennifer actually bought the cd and we listened to it a bit last weekend but I wanted to check it out for myself. His website is  http://www.bobschneidermusic.com  and the album can be listened to in it's entirety. It's also kind of neat because Bob has a commentary before each song where he explains the origin of the song, who wrote it and how he felt about it. He rambles a lot but it's kind of neat to here the back side of the album. His website is neato too.   Okay, my new favorite game online is COLLAPSE and you can download it at msn.com. Such a fun game - think Tetris cubed. It's just fun and very addicting. I quit playing for a few minutes and then I feel like I have to play it again. My high score is over 2 million points - who can beat me?!?!?!?!?!? NO ONE!  I am scanning in tons of documents for my mother right now so I should run.  I don't think I am ever going to finish this crap job!!!  ~~~~YUCKY~~~~  Oh yeah, make sure to check out the ACL Fest line up. Sheryl Crow!  http://www.aclfest.com   smooches, shell
