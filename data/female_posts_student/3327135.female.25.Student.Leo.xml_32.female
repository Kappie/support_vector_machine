I had finally settled with:        viineon             Those of you who had helped me choose this name would have known the reason behind this name. Those who don't know what this name is about, you would have to solve it like the novel,  Da Vinci Code.  Those who can't be bothered, it is fine, as there are no prizes for making the right guess.
