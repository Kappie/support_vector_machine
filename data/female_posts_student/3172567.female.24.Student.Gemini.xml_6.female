It took me 3 hours (with Joel's help, even!) to cut his back yard, and I have to freaking go back and cut the front on Tuesday.  I am SO going to be rich enough to pay a yard service to come cut my shit when I own a house.    I went to this new bar in town tonight called The Draft.  Its an alright place, except the music's a hair too loud for conversation.  The place was very clean, and very big, which are two things I have come to appreciate about night time places.      Well then!  I'm out.   Peace homies.
