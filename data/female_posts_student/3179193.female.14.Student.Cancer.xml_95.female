I was like: "whaaat...?!" and then we talked on the phone and she mentioned the blog entry on "May 1". So, I immediately checked it out... she quoted:  "I just hope CANDACE doesn't flirt with him. She flirts too much with every guy. Like Erica said, I'd flirt with Roger just to show Candace how it feels, but he's like a brother to me so flirting with your brother just isn't right. Plus, I've got Nima. I don't think Nima will be too comfortable with that. Erica won't flirt with him 'cos he's... a girl! Ewww~ Hee heezZ~! So yeah... If Candace tries to pull anything today, I'm sooo gonna bitch at her! >:( "  I was freaking out sooo much! Phew~ We got past most of the complication stuff and yeah... I'm really glad we talked a bit. *sighzZ* I talked to Roger too, on the phone. Whoaness~ Haha!  Hmm, Vivo wanted to go outside with Mark and Nima and I, but Nima wasn't home. Heard from Mark that he was at Cosmo getting a new amp. Blah... typical. *sighzZ* Candace and I will talk again later or whatever so yeah...  Complicatedness...
