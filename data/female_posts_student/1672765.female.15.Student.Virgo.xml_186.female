The past weekend I've been watching movies, sitting in the computer chair not doing anything, filling out those stupid surveys, listening to music and eating junk food.  That's how my entire summer is going to be.  I'm not exactly happy with that prospect. I have something I want to work on this summer but I'm not going to start it until next week. I want at least my first week of summer break to be easygoing.   I might be going into town later with my sister to rent some movies. I hope so. I want to rent:     Night of the Living Dead (I haven't seen it yet, isn't that horrible?)  Event Horizon (Love that movie)   Something else that I can't remember as of now. Maybe I'll rent Resident Evil. I told Michael I would sometime over the summer. I might wait till later into break to though. I'm thinking about renting Donnie Darko again. It seems like everybody loves that movie. I think I'm missing something about the movie.  I hope we go into town today at least. I need something to do.  My sister's been in a good mood lately. I'm so surprised but very glad. I was in the den yesterday afternoon, curled up in my fleece blanket with a few DVDs and my sister came in and laid on the couch and started watching Master and Commander with me. It was great. She usually doesn't like me at all but we had a pretty good time. I've seen it twice before then and she'd only seen it once and she had missed a whole lot and I was explaining some things to her. I saw it in English class and Mrs. Dirks had explained alot to us that I would never had known if it wasn't for her. I'll miss her.  After that I asked her if she wanted to stay and watch Reservoir Dogs with me and she didn't want to see it but asked if we could watch The Crow. So I went and got that and we watched that.   It was a pleasant afternoon.    Music: Love Buzz - Nirvana
