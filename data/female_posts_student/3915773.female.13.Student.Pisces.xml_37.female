On Thursday, July fifteenth,the consumers' union requested everyone in the country to refrain from using their cellphones to protest the absurd high rates. The protest was an excellent idea, with the exception of one small factor; the country's citizens are addicted to their cellphones. According to the article,the people of Lebanonhave no problem answering their cell phones during movies, or even during funerals for that matter. Perhaps one of the most interesting attemptsat boycott in the country was that of Abou Abed and Abou Staif, who decided to use carrier pigeons for the day. When one of the messages was did not get delivered, they ended up using their cellphones to figure out what had happened. The success of the boycott is still being debated, forthe consumer associatedfound that 30% of the cellphones in the country were shut off, but the ministry spokesman bleives the number to only be 10%. Either way, I was shocked to discover just how quickly society can become dependent on a such a recently released form of communication.
