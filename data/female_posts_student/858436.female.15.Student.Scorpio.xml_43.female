It was raining so we couldn't ride, so that night we went to the Carbondale mall, saw a movie, and then went out to eat with some of her friends at Fazolli's.   Sunday we trailered Al and Sy up to Todd's since he has an indoor ring. OMG was that eventful. Al was flipping out from the trailer. Long story, but we got there and back safely so it was good. Then that night we rented Seabiscuit and Crossroads and stayed at home, since it was snowing.  Monday we went to the mall again with another one of Mandy's friends. And then I went home.  Yep, it was a nice weekend. Tuesday was school and then that night I got pissed at my parents because they don't think I shoudl go to the Central/ND game next week since "my grades aren't good enough". Grr... And then today I was really sick so I stayed home. Tonight we're supposed to go have dinner since Charles's bday is tomorrow, but I'm going to stay home.  Guess that's all for now.
