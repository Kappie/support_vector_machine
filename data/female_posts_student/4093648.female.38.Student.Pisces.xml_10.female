I forgot how pleasant it can be to have a relaxed meal with someone or even just sit out on a deck drinking a margarita and enjoying the view.  It was time for an ego boost anyway.  He made me feel pretty and interesting and fun.  I haven't felt that way in a long time.  It isn't anything personal, but it doesn't much matter to me if I go out with him again or not.  He is a very nice guy, definitely a gentleman, but I would rather keep things casual.  Still, I'm glad I went.
