He called today to see if I wanted to go somewhere today but I wasn't here when he called. :(So by the time I gothis messege it was already 4:00pm!My bro sucks at giving me my messegesbut at the same time I am too!So I called himand him a few hours ago andWe will going out tomorrow, instead! I haven't been able to spend time with him since I was little...so I am really happy. But anypooh, I turned myapplication today. Hopefully they call me back and I get the job. That way I have a reason for getting out of work!:) The application was for a resturant not but 10 minutes away from my humble lil home! The manager really seemed to like me, so I hope that she likes me enough to give me the job. well I guess that's all for now! I'll get back to you later.
