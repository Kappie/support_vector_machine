Let the  urlLink Personal UV Monitor  determine how much sun you can take.         Make a slushie, no power required, with a  urlLink Slush Mug .         If you're over 21, you can bring a  urlLink Wine Chiller  instead, for instantly cold glasses of white wine.   Okay, have fun and I'll see you at the beach. Don't forget your sunblock.
