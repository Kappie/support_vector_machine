I look at America where it is so easy to get a gun. Open a bank account, get a free gun! That is outrageous. It gives the police there no authority at all. I think here our poilce force should be allowed guns. Not big guns, handguns maybe, some sort of gun. Or at least get officers out and about where they can be seen with guns so not everyone can carry then. I think knowing the police have guns would make people think twice about it so I agree with what Jo said. Even though I dislike the French...  I agree with you Jackie about there always being crime but hopefully the presense of guns would decrease general crime or at least put a stop to these shootings. Yes the highest trained gunman could miss but then think of the damage someone who isn't trained could do. I'd rather know there was someone at least slightly trained with a gun than someone who knows little. How about these air marshalls? Guns on planes? I think that we should have them on transatlanic flights, they aremost likely to be hijacked and as American have proved it has worked so far. I understand the worries about guns and the pressure of teh cabin but I think someone said on sky news they woudl take that into consideration and modify the planes or something. Someone else has created bullets which are made specially not to cause damage to the area. One shatters on impact and things like that. I think they are a good idea as I know what its like to be sitting there on a 9 hour flight and wondering what could happen.
