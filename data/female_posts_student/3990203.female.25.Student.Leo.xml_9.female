I want beer garden!!!  After work I went to the pictures to see Sherk with Chris and his little sister. God that is a funny film. well worth watching.  I then went back to Chris's and met his family, his mom lovely but his brothers aged 4 and 5 are absolutely mad!! Im not so worried about him meeting my family now!! although they could go mad as well!! will just have to wait and see.  He is coming next week to meet them all!! he must be mad.  Were going to stay in Glasgow for a few days while I have my re-sit. Were planning on meeting up with Maggie( looking forward to that) one night, so that should be fun. Were then going to head down to my mums, not sure for how long tho, depends how my family behave i guess, anyhow i dont have to be back at work until the following Tue.  As im at work writing this i better get on with some i guess!!  Hope you are all well
