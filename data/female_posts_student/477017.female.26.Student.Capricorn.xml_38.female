I scored none of the runs (thank you very much). and I got on base none of the times (oh you're too kind). But I did get a foul tip hit to me and I did catch it (how you like me now). and one of the hits that I had was a nice hit. It just happened to be hit right at the third baseman. Immediately following the game, I went up to my friend Mike's new condo that he just bought (the closing was on Wednesday). I had a six pack of  urlLink Twisted Tea® Half  Half  and I got him a 12 pack of  urlLink Bud Light . I thought that was pretty nice of me considering that I was going to his house to do work. Wait...shouldn't he have bought the drinks? Anyway, we patched up holes in the walls and I took all the old  urlLink contact paper  off of the shelves. It was pretty gross. We laid out all the drop cloths so that we can paint. We got all set up for today. Now we just have to sand down the walls a little where we patched the holes and then we can start painting. I'm kinda pissed though. Mike has a roommate that didn't even bother to show up last night to help out. I mean, I understand that it isn't his condo and he is just paying rent but that is still his friend and shouldn't he have shown up at least for like an hour to help out? After I left Mike's last night I met up with some of the guys from my softball team at a bar that is at the end of my street. LOVE THAT! And as usual, out left fielder Adam was there doing  urlLink Jaeger Bombs ! So I did one. And then I ran around the bar naked and hollering! Yeah right. But according to the bartender, we go through an average of a case and a half of  urlLink Red Bull  on Friday nights after our games. He was kinda complaining about it too! What the hell? I understand that they are a pain in the ass to make but at $6- a pop, who cares? And it's not like we order one or two at a time! There's usually at least 7 or 8 of us doing them. So we told him that he should know from now on that that's where we are going to be on Friday nights after our games and drinking in the parking lot.
