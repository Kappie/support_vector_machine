I don't understand why people do this... I'm always having people coming up to me comparing me to her, or saying things like, "No offense, but I really don't like your sister."  When these people say that they don't like her, it is as if my entire world stops. As soon as their words leave their mouth all sound is cut off. My ears don't work and everything turns into a black and white picture. The world is moving in slow motion and my mouth doesn't work, nothing works. I'm paralyzed... I can't tell if it is the shock or the anger that I feel that is rushing to my head. Everything is horrible. They DON'T even KNOW her. It makes me furious but I manage to bring color back to my world. It takes me five minutes or so to get back, and the struggle of it all makes me dizzy. Once I am back I try to act nice to that person that dislikes her, but it is a very hard thing to do. I know that they are entitled to their opinion but sometimes I just wish that someone could keep their mouths closed.  I just wish that she met someone that loved her, like my best friends to me. (At least I think they love me)   My sister, lostwinds I call her, has friends but they are all so mean to her. They push and prod and anger and put down. Everytime I see them I feel like murdering them. Don't they realise that she has been through alot? She's helped me with my eating habits, switching schools, making friends, becoming independent, pulled me away when that guy reached for his gun. She's been through shit. She's fallen down far in the social ladder, climbs back up, and slides down again. She's dealing with grades, my family's demanding nice-ness, my revolving feelings, the guy that she likes, our ex-best friend, my parents trying to kill eachother, the rumours, our dying camp, our disheartened spirits... She's terrific... but no one realises... I didn't even realise until today.  I was so wrapped up in my own crazy world that I didn't even realise how she was tumbling through her guises of fake smiles and faulty laughs. I'm so   ANGRY   at myself for not realising her tears, her depression...  I never noticed that she cried herself to sleep for I no longer sleep in the same room as she does.  How do I know all of this? Of her dying hope, strength, and love? Of her crushed dreams and her broken faith? How? Easy answer... I read her secret poems, stories, and such... I even broke into an account of hers. It's not a great thing to pry... It's mean. However, I was so angry with her. Our fights seemed to have been all of her fault. I swallow my own tears now and let forth the compassion for her lost soul. I never knew how she was dying... But now, thanks to my ruthless spirit, I have seen something that I had completely ignored before... I have seen a girl that puts on giant, plausible smiles to hide the hurt that lies so thickly within her heart.  Thinking of Nicole reminds me the good ole days of my camp... My camp was a great place. All the words ever created couldn't come even close at expressing the beauty, the adventure, the lessons learned, the magic...  However, I have written something below to show of my feelings towards the below.    Dear Me,       Love isn't possible at this age, they all say. Yet how can one truly love their family and friends at this age then, I must ask them. This love argument has nothing to do with my feelings for any one person but for one lone place that is forever stuck in my mind... and that place is my camp...      Every day I think of my camp. Every moment I live, every breath I breathe, every step that I take, every turn that I make, every thought that I create, every artwork that I illustrate, is of camp. Whether it is intentionally or unintentionally it is always coming out. The passion I have camp is always there in the back of my mind. It never walks away, it never eases away, it is hold so tight that a few tears shred from inside and litter my eyes with wet sparkles. The magic has never left my heart or my mind. It is a never-ending story to remember as it is a never-ending grieving session.      My memories of camp are blissful. They reflect many pleasurable times filled with hidden secrets and wondrous magic... They are so enjoyable... They are so wonderful that tears drip out of my eyes like a drizzling rain after a thunderstorm. The tears pour from my heart and a feeling of loneliness and longing nearly completely replaces the once joyous memories. This pain erupts but the beauty of it all never fades. The splendor is beyond even the wisest human's comprehension. It is the toughest part to try to understand, why the beauty chose to awash me with its delightedness... However the most cunning and brightest people in the world would spend many years trying to figure this out for it is nearly impossible. Only those that are not fools but are not wise would understand...      Although many common folks seem to fit that description, it is not so... A background, a canvas, must be built and painted upon. The people need a special personality... or none at all... They, like I, would enjoy my camp's mystic scents of everlasting love and tenderness for many years, not letting the question go unanswered but neither resolved. One day, they too, would discover that answer. That is not very simple nor quite complex. The answer can be understood in many of different shapes and forms. It all depends on the person who asked it.     In other cases the answer to this question may be written in a paragraph or only a few sentences, but in my case it would take years for you to even begin to understand those simple words strung together to formulate the sentences that I shall write below this paragraph. The words are simple, much like two plus two equals four, but their meaning should never be repressed.       "The answer to this question has been neither easy nor hard to learn or understand. The answer is basic enough for even the youngest child to understand as well as the eldest adult. Camp blesses those with hope, love, faith, generosity, compassion, and/or crazy, almost impossible dreams. It blesses these people with the strength to pursue their wackiest ideas about life and love. However, although it is Certaintly marvelous gifts some people lose sight of these qualities in them for the growing power of greed that overcomes them. Camp does not do any service to those that do thus. Even though camp seems selfless in this act, it is not entirely NOT benefiting from this process. Along the way of your path of life, it teaches you life lessons. It teaches you things that will help you grow into a strong, caring, and wonderful person. The lessons are taught underneath your eyelids as you move throughout the waters, beaches, island, and other adventured places. It teaches you to survive and respect even your cruelest enemies even at your worst moments. The answer is one to ponder on... Camp shapes into a real "human." It shapes you this way without any damage to your soul. It does not act against your will. It changes your mind on things... It changes you until you realize that worrying about everything going on in your life is the most foolish thing to do at the moment. Your worries disappear with the roaring wind and your tears fall into the depths of the soothing lake. It turns your fears and your dreams into one. Thunderstorms are beautiful when you are there. Everything is beautiful when you are there. It is as if time has stopped. It teaches the most important lessons that a person can learn and with ease. It teaches you... so that in hopes of one day someone changes themselves because of the things you do that they taught you. It is saving the world, every person at a time.   Signed lovingly.    Why does Nicole remind me of my camp? Why, you may ask me a million times. I think the only one answer is  that Nicole has taken the magic of camp and has hidden it there in her heart. Something about her drives me wild. Everything she does has a faint aurora of camp attached to it. It's beautiful. I guess camp hasn't ever truly left me. It sustained itself in the hearts of those that have fallen apart. It pieces everything together.  You may say that I am insane. And I for one, agree with you. I am insane... A place is just a place and a person is just a person... right? Well, it's a great thing that I am crazy, for if I wasn't I would actually believe that crap.   In conclusion I've realized that my sister is something entirely different and something that will stay forever in my heart. Her spirit, her courage... She is invincible, despite her insecurities.
