Joey and JC from Nysnc. lol and u know on the plane, Britney Spears was a flight attendant..wow...lol and that Gar-funk-le dude was buyin a cd in the cd store..it was weird. oh and o-town was watchin a basketball game on tv...and Take 5 (i dont even remember them) we preforming at the basketballs half time show. it was a really fucked up movie. But it all came out happy. yay. Then i watched True Life: im gay and getting married.

I've got about 4 chords down and i can play a small part of a beatles song. yay! lol i love when i can mix chords and they sound cool. lol The only bad thing? i cant tune my guitar worth shit, so i need someone to tune it. ive used my tuner thingie, but hell..it still sounds bad i think. not like they do on mtv. hahahah or maybe its just my playing abilites!! i doubt it..i cant make the sound suckass.
