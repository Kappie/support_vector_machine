(^-^) I am out of GB and no more waking-up-in-the-morning saturdays, YEAH!!! So, what I watched were Kim Possible, Hercules, Jing Tian Yi and Love Hina! All of them are my favourite shows except Hercules and KP. I just watched it for fun. They were quite funny. Like KP, this episode featured her been engrossed in Animalogy. She was a BLUE FOX and her villian's son was a white throat, (yeah, I don't know how to spell, just the sound is alike to THROAT...) they were perfect SoUlMaTeS... So, hilarious incidents happened. In Hercules, Hercules and his friends were turned back to babies when they were hit by the hOlY wAtEr. They did look kind of cute....
