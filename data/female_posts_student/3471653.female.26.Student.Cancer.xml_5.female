So far s/he's only gotten as far as page 49, but it's really interesting.  Slacktivist explains why these novels deserve a detailed critique, rather than simple mockery:  "But why take the risk at all? Why expose myself and the readers of this blog to the potentially toxic foolishness of Left Behind?  Because LB is more than simply a wretched novel. It is a wretched novel with serious consequences. It is, among other things, an assault on the central beliefs of the Christian faith..."  And, I might add, its popularity means that our Christian brothers and sisters everywhere will repeat its heresies and uncharities.  Read  urlLink slacktivist's blog  for links to other people's theological reflections--including a wonderful Mennonite's--and for such quotes as  "The thinnest ice on which a theologian can stand concerns questions about, "If you were God, who would you send to Hell?" The answer, of course, is, "I'm not God, so what're you asking me for?"   And this, which I like best of all--  "Evangelical Christianity, at its core, is radically inclusive. Evangelicals, born-againers, want everybody else to become born-again too.  Granted, this inclusivity isn't always expressed in the most winsome or persuasive manner, but it's the heart and soul of evangelicalism.   .... But that's not what one finds in Left Behind. Here you find little concern--and even less of a sense of responsibility--for the plight of the untold millions. What one finds instead is a sense of triumphalism. Those "inside the fold" feel no sense of obligation to those on the outside -- they are bad people who are getting what they deserve and the godly remnant gets to watch, more in delight than in sadness....  In Left Behind the gospel is not the good news of salvation to be shared with the untold millions. It is a secret to be treasured, hoarded and hidden under a bushel by the chosen few."
