So instead I woke up cleaned some and tried to put some of my room back together. Then at about 12:30 we left and went to Cleburne where we were supposed to get coffee and to get apuffer fish. Well we forgot about coffee, they were out of puffer fish, so we got fried pickles instead. We went out by the lake and ate the fried pickles, went to his house and watched "his favorite tv show"...when we realized that maybe we shouldnt have eaten the fried pickles, because we both threw up. Then he got ready to go play in the scramble and he brought me home...so while I was waiting for him to come home...I started hanging things up and stuff. Then I went to the Family Dollar store to look for like one of those rugs ya know that ya hang on the wall for decoration, but they didnt have any...so if you know where any are...give me a call or just IM me. Whatever works for you. Then I came home...worked some more...got tired, gave up and laid down and watched some TV. Then at about 9 Jake came over to see my room so far, and he left...so then I watched some more TV. Which brings us to here...Im soo tired...yet again and my stomach still kinda hurts. So Im gonna go talk on the phone some, make down my bed, and then pass out. Till then, Later Days.
