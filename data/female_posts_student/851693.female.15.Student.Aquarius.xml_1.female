For a start, I'd like to put on record my gratitude to VERONICA and MICHELLE who have done a wonderful, wonderful job in leading us through the conceptualisation and rehearsals of BSD. THANK YOU and because of you both and everyone else who havebeen so committed, be it in acting, publicity, design, we are going to put up a fantastic play!        And as Shaoming reminded me, thank you to CHENG SHANfor leading the Chinese cast. I have complete faith that the 3 parts will come together beautifully by end of August!    Some of you have highlighted that we only have a month or so left, so things are taking on greater urgency.    And these are some very URGENT MATTERS TO ATTEND TO:     1) PROPS AND COSTUMES     - We need to confirm the props and dimensions of props by end of this week then start getting them constructed so that they can be ready in 2 to 3 weeks.    - For costumes, designs for all characters must be confirmed by early next week please. If we need to custom-make some of the costumes, it will take at least 3 weeks, so please get the costume designs done soon.    - A list of hand props must be confirmed ASAP too.         2) PUBLICITY     - We will start publicity and ticket sales in about 2 weeks' time. This week, we'll be printing posters and we'll start with publicity and ticket sales within the school. Posters will be put up and ticket orderforms will be given to each class.Subsequently, we'll 'invade' other schoolsto set up ticket boothsin about a month's time.    - For school publicity, we need to think of a captivating way of introducing our play to the whole school during flag-raising, so start thinking ok?      3) COMBINED REHEARSALS     -We must run through the whole play (all3 parts) in about 3weeks' time. Musicmust be confirmed by then too.    - For rehearsals in the AUDITORIUM, I managed to get 3 dates: 3 Sept, 6 Sept and 8 Sept.They will be booked for about4 hours each time from 12 to 4p.m. Be prepared for intensive rehearsals everyday of the Sept hols for the last lap!          4)  AOB        - Let's start taking photos of the rehearsals and other prep work so that we have lots of photos to choose from for the programme booklet/exhibition/our own memories.     - We'll print the posters and tickets on our own to cut down costs. For the programme booklet, we'll ask a professional printer to print about 500 copies and these will be given to members of the audience who give a token donation. Otherwise, we'll give out programme leaflets which will feature the synopsis, cast, crew, acknowledgements which will be mass printed in school.    OK, i'm sure i still have lots to tell you, so i'll update this once i remember what they are. (Michelle, wanna update anything I've left out from our informal meeting this morning?)      THRIVE ON! THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT!
