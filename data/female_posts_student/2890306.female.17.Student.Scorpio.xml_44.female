None of them remembered the encounter with me, however brief.  The day was run of the mill, as every other that had dawned before it.  Shuffle to work, shuffle to school.  Everyone with his own agenda, his own plan for the day.  I had mine.    The man had his.    I saw a man in the crowd today.  Black slacks, slightly scuffed loafers, nice dress shirt, standard issue business attire.  Nothing particularly special.  As he brushed past, time seemed to slow.  Now, my sidewalk neighbors were floating past.  All sound had escaped the scene.  I saw this man in the crowd today.  He moved slowest of all, and I could see who he was.  A business partner, scrambling for the best deal.  A single guy who had recently stopped believing in love after being rejected...again.  A son who, to his mother, was the most handsome man in all the world.  A poet, strugging to arrange his words in the right order.  All at once, I knew what he ate for breakfast this morning, what his favorite movie was, the person he hoped to be, and the last time he felt at peace.  All at once this standard issue man was human too.  I saw him in the crowd today.  And I don't mean I simply looked.    Who have you seen?
