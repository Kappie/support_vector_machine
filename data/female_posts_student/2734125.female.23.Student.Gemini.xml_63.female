The experience is a feeling of seeing the pattern in the present that paints a clear picture of the time line that we seem to think is real.    It is hearing and it is imbibing.  It is understanding the inter-connected lines of life.  I was listening to this voice Saturday night, and came to a new understanding of how souls travel, how we are dispersed, how we die and don't.  How we gain an extended consciousness, and it was all a metaphor.  I could explain it sometime, if you wanted to hear it- the long theory that is that moment of anticipation before we step into an unknown space- a combination that the soul has never before encountered- and it happens a thousand times a day- but is rarely understood I think.  Maybe we all have a philosophers stone, and I would describe my revelation and you would only nod knowingly, or condescendingly, and I would swallow and be humbled, again.    Now it is dusk, and I am watching the world grow cool with moisture and air.  We are all being swept into the joy of light, the instinctual draw towards a time when we emerge from buildings and it is still visual.  I am listening to music that makes it hard to separate my words from those of the song.  I am listening to songs about danger and pain and life and revolution and change and love.  It is refreshing.  I made copies of the CD today to give to my peacejam youth.  I think that it is cool enough to impress them, but strange enough to be thought provoking.  That's my hope anyway.  There is a blue bird that has been hanging out around our roof, and he lets me watch him sometimes.  I still dream of someone appearing and taking me to another reality where I am the heroin, and not just another person.  Sometimes in my wandering mind I am kidnapped, or called, or a door opens, and sometimes blue jay birds change shape and become something other- something that I need to follow into an adventure.  I think that I underestimate the magick of my own life, the power of the moment, my adventures compared to that of an epic, a game, a narrative that we are able to only see the highlights of.  Forgetting that my story may be amazing to another person, and now that I am living it, I cant see the truth or tragedy of it.    The sky is candy stripped tonight, a purple storm with pink sitting gaily on top, and then a clear blue that would be frightening to look into if it was someone's eyes.  You would know they were either god or the devil- its that kind of blue on top.  I think that I will walk tonight.  I dreampt last night an old stress dream of going on stage without lines, and I was sure that I could do it, but it was unnerving none the less.  Maybe starting a new job.  I am always frightened that I will be burned somehow, mess up horribly somehow.  Each new thing carries that tension.  Maybe it keeps us on our toes, an old genetic trait given to those that would survive new events.  Confidence and mild nausea.  I am not bolstered.  Still, its something.  Its worked before.  Its all in trust I suppose.  Enough, I need to walk into the blueing evening.
