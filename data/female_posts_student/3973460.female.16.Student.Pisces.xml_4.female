I forgot to bring money to order out, so Jen was sad *insert very sad smiley face*. The good thing was that we only had about 30 campers, and with the 10 counselors, there was a 3 to 1 camper to counselor ratio.So that was pretty cool. We watched the Little Rascals, what a stupid movie. I'm sorry, I didnot likeit at all. Then I did the usual and played cards with the campers. Oh what fun! Then at about 2, we left and went back to the park. A girl started to cry during her MAU game and called everyone at the table a jerk. I wasn't there when it happened, but my campers told me when I came back. I laughed. You'd be surprised how overdramatic 9 year olds are. Then, we walked to buses. Me and Greeney went to clock out and noticed that none other than the devil herself, Jen Alpert, is back. My first thought was that she's replacing Jeremy and it made me mad *insert extremely mad smiley face*. I clocked out, ran to my bus and my bus driver asked me to take a first grader to the bathroom. My feet were in so much pain from walking and I almost started to cry when I was forced out of the bus, in the heat to take this girl to the bathroom. It turns out that she wanted to save an injured cricket on her way to the bathroom. I really didn't understand that at all. I mean, if she wanted to save an injured rabbit, that's understandable. But a cricket? Dude, when I was in first grade, I was terrified of crickets, and if anything, if I saw an injured cricket, I would want someone to kill it. Anyway, the buses started to leave when we got back and I fell asleep on the bus. Now I'm home and all of Ryan's friends are over for his 10th birthday bash. Oh fun, oh fun. I'm gonna go now. Bye.
