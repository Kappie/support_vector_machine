It is such a long story but I must say, without Shamus, I’ll never get to know Edwin. Shamus loves me the way every girl would want a man to. He is always so proactive towards me. He can always make me laugh when I am dead mad. When I am with him, he makes me feels like I am a princess…    Today, I went into PT again as I was thinking I might be able to see him there. I typed out the command to pm him but was disappointed that he was not online. Anyway, to my horror, my priestess was carrying some shit items and not what was originally mine. WTF happened man… Only Shamus and Bul have my passwords to my characters and at that time, I can only think that it’s Shamus who took them away. Well, I could be wrong but it doesn’t matter now. I was rather furious and decided to strip my priestess clean. A lot of super "gian ben” people was around me trying to get all those precious items I dropped.    I dropped every single thing on my priestess except for some red pots. Couldn’t bear to drop them… They were in a shape of a heart and beside the heart there is a U. It was made by Shamus months back when I was still active in the game. I logged off my priestess and logged in my archer. I can’t recall if there were missing items on my archer, as it was not my main character. Well, I went to the circular place where I hide from Shamus before. That time, I was just teasing him; I told him that if he could find me in that map within the next 3 mins, I’d marry him… Well, strange enough, he found me…. Shamus always tells me things he SEE. For example, he could see my house from his vision. He could describe everything he saw and again, I must admit he does have this weird ability to SEE. He always got them right… He told me that we’d be together one day, somehow. He told me he saw himself going movie with a fat girl; me…. Well, he once mentioned, he would never give me up as it takes more than a miracle to find “The One”. :”) It’s all sweet memories now.    I cried a lot as I think of him. He was really nice to me but it’s just too bad that he is 3 years younger than me. “Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age.” True? I dare not take this risk. Though you are rich and you love me lots but hey, you had never seen me before and you’ll always be a young boy in my heart… Another reason why I cried like mad was because he said he loves me so much yet he now feel for someone so fast so soon… Haiz… Love? Go read his blog if anyone is interested;  urlLink http://www.youyongku.blogspot.com  Btw, I wrote him an email and this is what I had written. I seriously hope that darling will never come read my blog again or…     I downloaded PT again. I wanted to see if you were around but you aren't. I stripped my priestess since my items had been changed. I left the pots you made into a heart and a U untouched. I was rather disappointed that you were not online. I went to the place that you found me and recalled and rejoice many things about us. I cried for us, for our love that was once so pure but it's gone now. I felt lost and cold. I hope whatever is happening to us now will bring us to a good ending.    Love I felt for you, are still ever so strong, I am surprised myself. Love, be it now or then, it has never decrease. Love was never easy for us. Love came at the wrong time for us I believe. Love should come only years later I relent. Love was sweet and painful for both of us I think. Love improves a person and I hope you felt that. Love did make me a better person and I would treasure all that you’ve taught me. Love for you would stay in my heart till the day I die, this I promise you.    You seem happier now that you fell in love with Snow White. You must eat more and sleep more since you are happy now. You have to be a responsible working adult and don’t always give people headaches. You must stop smoking for goodness sake. You take good care of Dad, Mum and Justin, as you are eldest in the family. You will be serving the nation soon so please take good care of yourself. You had read till the last three sentences now. You must be wondering why every paragraph seems weird. You read again and you’ll realize there are nine I Love You altogether and yes; I do love you till this very day.     Ya lah I know, I super damn contradicting to the extremes but you also can't deny the fact that a guy like this will not capture your heart... Haiz... Whatever lah... By the way, there is this thing which is pissing me to the infinite liao! I was using Microsoft Word to type and all of a sudden there is a sign that appears behind everyword that I am typing... Worst of all, I couldn't seems to get rid of it no matter what icon I clicked on... WTF!! Pissing me off in the middle of the night and moreover, I am already so fucking tired like hell! TMDZ!!! Can someone who knows what I am talking about, give me a call can tell me a solution please! I will buy you prata I promise!    Okie, guess it's time to get back to my daily event report. I woke up today feeling a little excited as it's Angels' birthday party later in the evening. Well, I went out of my room and saw a big tray of sotong balls freshly fried to be brought to the chalet. Hee! As usual, I pinched and pinched, steal and steal the balls into my mouth and slowly chew them down my throat. My mum went passed me minutes later and was commenting about the balls,"Weird, how come 90 over balls looked so little to me...". Guess whats my reply! KAKAKKAKAKAK!! I said,"Hannoh, why so little sia, I had only eaten 8 or 9 ma..." My mum looked at me and said,"8 or 9 only huh!!!!" KAKAKKAKAKAKAKAKKAK!! BUAY TAHAN!!! Hiak! We reached the East Coast Coasta Sand Chalet around 1pm. 2 words to summarised what had greeted me at that place, SUPER SUCKS! That place was so dirty and the rooms were all run down and there were some repairs to be done for some fixtures and the toilet bowl water tank was not working and the weather was killing me!!!! DAMN IT!    Anyway, the party was supposed to be a fun one but because of some stupid malay spg bimbos that were invited, I kinda lost appetite man! WTF!! All those bitches dressed as if they are working in Geylang and behaved like they are some super whores! What a disgraced to the family... All thanks to the little sister of mine... Haiz... When will she ever learn? Anyway, all I can say is, in the mind of those ang mohs, all they care for is a good fuck and anyone who can offer them a good fuck, is just another fucking whore to them. :) Please don't go around catching viruses or diseases and end up screwing with one another. Ah, the food was good though. Especially the chickens and the cake. Hee!! YUMMY!! Wow, 6am already, me and my another CHIONG HEI BLOG! Goodnite to all moi friends. I kinda miss my darling now. He is such a sweet little baby...   Kisskiss!
