Here is a brief synopsis of my day:   Groggily roll out of bed around 10am, (11am or 12pm if I don't have my one class of the summer,) and slowly pad into the living room. I usually glance half-heartedly at my online meteorology course and wonder if I should finish the 7 chapters I have 3 weeks to do. (Not to mention the 3 tests I have to take.) At this point, I decide whether or not I have to go to school to use the computer since I am too poor to own my own. If there is nothing pressing, I may get absorbed in  Unsolved Mysteries  or the  Nanny  on  Lifetime  or something else equally interesting. (I actually spend a lot of daytime hours watching the  Food Network  jotting down new recipes. I have a great recipe collection because of this.)   Sometimes, if I am feeling ambitious, I may mosey on down to Provo on my Bike, about a 5 mile bike ride from my house up one  ENORMOUS  hill, and go to the local waterpark that my friends and I have season passes to. (It reminds me a lot of good ol  Whitewater Bay ; it costs $20 to get in and you're bored after about 2 hours. We got our season passes for $30, normally $120, so we feel this was a worthwhile puchase.) However, Amber, my old roomate, is currently out of town and Sondra, the other person we got passes with, is in Colorado until Aug.   Then, whenever I have finished the worthwhile activity that manages to take up my afternoon, I come home and see if anyone wants to play with me. Inevitably rejected, I fix dinner, maybe make cookies, search my movie collection for new scenes/monologues to do in Acting Class, and then settle in to watch the  Nanny  @ 10pm. @ 11pm, when it's over, I'll flip to  CourtTV  or  A  and see if I've seen that particular Forensic Files or Crossing Jordan re-run, which occupies my time until  Millionaire  comes on the  Game Show Network  @ 1am. I usually toss and turn in bed until about 2 or 3am and the viscious cycle begins again.  *SIGH*   Let's face it; more often than not my typical day ends up being like the one I had yesterday: Worked out @ 10am, then settled down and watched a  History's Lost  Found  marathon on the  History Channel  until I had to go to acting class @ 6pm!   DAMNIT! I need a job before I go insane . . . or run out of room for recipes, which ever comes first.
