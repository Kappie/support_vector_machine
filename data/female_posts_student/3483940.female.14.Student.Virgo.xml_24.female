I have to pick every single little weed in the garden. WHY THE PAIN I TELL YOU.   I went to camp for a week. what a lovely time. My good sandals went missing in this mushy dirt in the lake, they were being worn by someone else. My camara fell into some water canoeing. All's i wanted to do is take a picture at this little island. My disc man almost got smashed because i left it. Maybe that was my fault. but its all i had to surive holidays with my brother and sister. So then i had to wash dishes with all the groups, every day, every lunch, breakfast, and supper!. But besides that camp was a delight. It was fun. And there was lots of freedom. For my growth in the lord, i will comment on that at another time. The people their were wicked.  Then i got picked up the friday to join my family on wonderful relaxing holidays. Really though the place were we stayed was beautiful, the people were snobby. The lake was wonderful. I learned how to wake board. It took me 2 days to finally get out the water. But the third day it happend. Unfortantally it was the last day we had the boat. But my dad bought the boat, just couldn't take the boat home because you can't pull a trailer and a boat at once. I met some cool poeple. Like Maxwell and Cullie. Max has a lisp. And it was utturly funny. Im going to miss them, but i them on video!. But then my brother started getting my nerves as always. and there was fighting. Traveling was hell. Cramped in the middle and being car sick. Normal family actions on this holiday i supose.   Well i will write more later, for my brother is in the room.   Hannah
