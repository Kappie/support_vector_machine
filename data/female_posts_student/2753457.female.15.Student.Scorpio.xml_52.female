TAP is a happy place.  I think it is the place where I am most respected, and that means so much to me.  It's nice to know that I can come back to that and that I'm still eligible for four more years.  Although I won't deny that I have been pretty worn out.  The Enloe chorus carwash got rained out so I finally got to sleep late this morning.  When I woke up and looked in the mirror, I almost laughed out loud at how much stage makeup was still on my face.  Today will definitely be a chilled out day.  I have to be back at Cary Academy by 6:30.  The cast party is tonight.  That ought to be really fun because I'm pretty sure that Caro is staying after the show.  The thing I'm not looking forward to is the withdrawal come Monday.  Oh well.  Nothing to do but savor until then. Hmmm, I think Joncie called here.  I need to go call her back.  Then I will plop down with my discman and the Decemberists.  It will be a mellow five hours.
