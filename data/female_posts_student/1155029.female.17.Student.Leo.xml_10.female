     
      Two quotes.   "Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway."   "There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the same thing you were after."
