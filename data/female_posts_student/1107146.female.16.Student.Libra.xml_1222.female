We apologized afterwards, but he was like "yeh, ok.  fine.  whatever.  God forgives you." He wouldn't let me explain.  Whatever.  I don't like him anyway, and now I'm even more on his bad side.  Wahoo.  Deech has issues that he needs to work out.  By the way, how was I sinning by being loud and how does he know that God forgave me?  When has he become so pure that he is God's spokesperson?  I don't get it.  I don't want to go to small groups.  Its really becoming boring and bad.  I don't really like Wynn anymore.  He's kinda a jerk.  But I have to go to tell Gaddis that I don't need his help with the canned food drive, because no one brought cans.  Well, how was 42nd Street?  And why isn't anyone else responding to these?  Right now it seems like I'm just having a really long drawn out conversation with Lindsey.  Whatever.  Peace out
