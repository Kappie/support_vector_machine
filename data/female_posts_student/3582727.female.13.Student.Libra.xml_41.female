Because I realize that it's hardly good that my July archive has a grand total of three entries. My, my...       urlLink www.googlism.com  - This is pretty amusing. Last night I was going to post my googlism here, but I had to eat dinner in the middle of it, and when I got back my STUPID MORON BROTHER had turned off the computer. I...wasn't pleased. Anyway, I'd post it again, but I'd have to insert all the returns between the lines, and also I cut out about half of them because they were repetitive and boring. So if you want to see mine, check it out for yourself - and if you know my real name, that one's probably better, since it's...not a tree.       Now, what to ramble about next?      I finished  A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man  last night. It was...alright. But it's definitely not going on my "Favorite Books" list. I'm fairly surprised that it was ranked third in a poll of the best novels of the twentieth century. Maybe I'm just not old enough to fully appreciate it... I don't know. Whatever. I'll start  Dubliners  today.      My dad was on vacation starting two weeks ago tomorrow, and today is his first day back at work. I'm glad. For some reason the days seemed much longer when my dad was home. I much prefer it when he's not - I'm not quite alone, but my brother's not nearly as annoying on days like this then when he's with my dad. Also, I've been at my dad's house (my parents are divorced, if I haven't already mentioned it) for his whole vacation, and now I really feel like I've been here too long. Which, is funny, since a lot of people only have one house, obviously... But I miss my cats, Flower and Pickle, and my new old school Super Nintendo. Oh, and I haven't seen my mom in awhile. Hm.       New old school. Heh. What I mean is that we just bought it off of eBay a few weeks ago for thirty-four dollars (plus shipping and handling). Not bad, huh? Plus it came with five games.       Anyway, I'm really looking forward to going to my mom's house on Wednesday. And honestly, it's not because I miss my mom. Not at all. It's mostly because I miss my cats. They beat out my mom any day. Also, my mom was planning on painting my bedroom while I was at my dad's house, so that should be...interesting, at the very least. And my grandpa just finished building a lofted bed for me, so that should be in my room now. Yay. Happy room.       Okay, I think I've seriously bored you for long enough. I'm pretty much out of things to say, anyway. So, farewell, my friends. And my acquaintances. Acquaintance. That's a pretty word. Hum...      Ergh. Jacob Roy just IMed me. Why?!
