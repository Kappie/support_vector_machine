Sharpton if he would like to lead the discussion of the word "tragedy."  So the illustrious leader asks the class for an example of a "tragedy."  One little boy stands up and offers: "If my best friend, who lives on a  farm, is  playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy." "No," says the Great Al Sharpton," that would be an accident."  A little girl raises her hand: "If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy." "I'm afraid not," explains the exalted spiritual leader. "That's what we would call a great loss."  The room goes silent. No other children volunteer. Rev. Sharpton searches the room. "Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?"  Finally at the back of the room a small boy raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: "If a plane carrying the Rev. Sharpton were struck by a missile and blown to smithereens that would be a tragedy."  "Fantastic!" exclaims Sharpton, "That's right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?" "Well," says the boy, "because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss and it probably wouldn't be an accident either."
