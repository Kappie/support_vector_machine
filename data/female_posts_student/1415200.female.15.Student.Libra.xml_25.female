I think Hate is a strong enough word. But maybe it's not.  I hate him. That's all there is to it. I can't stand to think about him, I can't stand to look at him, I can't even stand to say his name. So I'm not. He acts like he's my best friend, he acts like he doesnt know me. His a double-eged sword, and I sometimes wish that I never became friends...with him. But enough with that. I need some movie ideas. I gots my camcorder for xmas this year, and all the editing equipment to go along. I need to write scripts, and have willing-non-paid actors to come and be in my movies.  I get to go back to school on Monday. Not today. Next monday. Oh, joy. (sarcasim) I really dont want to go back, because that means I have to see certain people. But on the other hand I will get to see the gorgeous Jon, (see previous entry.) *smile.*  "There I am standing all alone on the Sydney Harbor Brige. And you know I would jump into the fucking ocean if it meant I was truly capable of being satisfyed. Will I ever be? Did I just give up the best thing I ever had?" The Ataris.   My head hurts, my stomach hurts, and Im getting hungry. You might think this all seems like it's too much. Because it is.
