I can be a strong person and try to get over the worst of things.  Because the worst hasn't happened yet. But I can feel it coming. It's painful. I kinda hope I'm just being paranoid, but I can see it.  I suppose that's the price I'll have to pay.  Pay for what? I don't know anymore.  I don't quite understand why my life is one big punishment....I guess it's for being alive or something. Or for being faithless.  I worked from 4:30-12 last night, then went to IHOP.  blah blah blah.  'I have a picture of you on my wall. And IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII....'  HAHAHAHAHA. Oh good times.  Thrift Town and a car show today. whoo hoo!  Have a great day crazies.
