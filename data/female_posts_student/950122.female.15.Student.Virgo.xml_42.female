We really depend on electricity now a days. Seeing photos from NYC with the traffic jams, people walking in the streets and commuters sleeping everywhere, I just imagined what it would be like if we really used up all of our energy resources. Conserve energy! It's not to late!!! [I hope.]  urlLink Here  are some pictures of the blackout in NYC taken by the moderator of  urlLink imood.com .  About being forgotten.... I feel like I'm being abandoned by my family. It's a stupid thing to say, but them going to Virginia and all.... it makes me feel all alone. Solitude is okay, but loneliness is different. I feel so left behind. My mom keeps on talking to me about what would happen if anything were to happen to them; where the Bonds are, where my parent's wills are, where we keep our important documents... but I just don't want to think about it. It's selfish, but I really don't care that much at the moment. We're all being inconsiderate to each other. Everytime I start to miss my brother, he does something that makes me feel like I shouldn't miss him.  He had his farewell party yesterday; we all had a lot of fun. Now I know I'll miss him no matter what he does or says to me. u.u I don't knw how to let him go.... I don't know if I can let him go.
