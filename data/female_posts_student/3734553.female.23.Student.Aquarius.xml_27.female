That will be the true test, and if I can do that, I should be cool.  We had a family reunion on Saturday. I have about 20 cousins under 14. I took 6 of them to see the village on Friday. I liked the movie. But I was expecting a scary movie, that I could use to scare the kids and was a little let down by that. Good times though. Lots of Laughing all week long.  I move in the morning so this will probably be the last post for a while. I am supposed to have internet by Weds. but we'll see.  Lots to look forward too. Moving, Law school, surfing with Wayne, haven't seen Krys in about 2 months, roadtrips to Austin...
