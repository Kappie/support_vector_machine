who else was there? who the bday party was for? we don't remember.  so today, i accompanied philip to his friend's bday party in leiu of his girlfriend who had a previous engagement. the whole idea was that we get the dinner party over with as fast as possible so we could drive to hollywood to check out the bar where we're thinking of holding our bday bash. well.....first of all, philip's friend told him that the bday dinner would start at 5pm, so when we arrived at 5:15pm, we were chagrined at the idea of being the late arrivals who held everyone up from ordering, but upon entering steven's steakhouse, found ourselves being two of the first outta the 20 guests scheduled to arrive. so we were seated pretty fast, but ended up waiting maybe an hour and 47 minutes (but who's counting...)before the rest of her party got here so we could start ordering. and even though philip and i had a good hour and 47 minutes with the menu, philip was still quite flustered when the waitress came around, completely ditched his ordering gameplan which he'd been adamant about for the past hour, and ended up pointing at me and saying "errr...i'll have what she's having." fifteen minutes later, he flagged the waitress down again to change it back to his original order. so the food didn't arrive until maybe 52 minutes later (but who's counting....), and we were pretty pooped by that time cuz we were inexplicably hyper throughout the first two hours of waiting, irrationally over-expending our pre-meal energy through inane laughter and uber-goofiness. so then the food FINALLY arrived, and it tasted like ka-ka, maybe cuz neither of us ordered steak even though we were at a steakhouse, but we still ploughed through and chowed down because it is in our nature to eat what is set before us. a few minutes after we were done, philip mumbled some excuse to his friend and we ran for the exit. we were the very first ppl to leave while the rest of the table was still finishing their food, but i definitely think we'd paid our dues.  sooooo...after a three hour meal, 90% of which was spent waiting and 10% of which was spent swallowing doodoo, we were super happy to be liberated from the restaurant that we felt like we'd spent a few lifetimes in, and were pretty giddy once again as we set forth on the real mission of the night: to check out our bday site. so we followed philip's ambiguous mapquest directions and somehow ended up getting lost and stopping for directions at a ghetto gas station and ended up making enough u-turns to lose all sense of direction. by the time we finally reached our destination an hour later, a bar/nightclub named the hollywood canteen tucked into a tiny middle-of-nowhere street, all was quiet and not a soul was around. me, being the hopeless optimist, thought that either the club just wasn't very happenin', or that all the guests were carless pedestrians and the joint had great soundproof walls...but alas, when i bounded across the street and reached for the door, it would not budge an inch. yes we are idiots. today is sunday, and after all that trouble, the place was not even open, and it had occurred to neither of us to call and check in advance. well...i think it occurred to me earlier in the day, but i probably got distracted by a hangnail and forgot.  so sad. there weren't even any windows that we could peek through to get a view of the inside. so yeah, we felt pretty tarded and moted up the butt. upon returning to the car, it simultaneously occurred to both of us that this is definitely a moment worth blogging about. after fighting for two minutes over who would be saved the trouble of blogging and given the rights to copying the other's person's entry, we got distracted by...some other topic of conversation, forgot what we were talking about before, forgot about the evening's abortive mission, and laughed our way back home.
