First I went to his house to print some stuff, but then his comp kept freezing.  That sucks cause my printer decided it would feed through 100 pieces of paper instead of 1.  So yeah now I have a jammed printer and can't print anything with color.  Go figure, last week of school before finals and I am like breaking everything in my house.  Mat then came over and we watched Shrek, then we ate too much damn food cause I seriously think my blood pressure must have gone like sky high when I saw that number on the scale today.  Haven't seen it that high in a while, but everyone around me claims I still look the same.  I suppose a bit of weight gain last week of schools and week before finals is to be expected.  It's like the ultimate stress weeks.  Not to mention tomorrow is a pretty big Bio test, cause it's the last chance I have to bring up my mark before the final.  I study so hard for those tests all the time, and everytime I always get a mark that I know I don't deserve.  For the amount of hard work and effort I put it, I truly, honestly, in the deepest part of my heart know for a fact I deserve an 80% on all of those tests.  Life ain't perfect though, and I guess in an un-perfect world, hard work and effort doesn't always pay off.  To make things kind of bad though is that well I haven't talked to Chels in a while.  That in itself isn't that bad, except she was talking to Mat about how I didn't talk to her anymore, and she thinks I am mad cause 'there's never enough time to spend with her.'  So I don't know exactly what her problem is at the moment.  I asked her to talk today and you know what she said "no."  So now a girl who was my best friend won't even talk to me, in fact I have said maybe like three things to her in like the last two weeks.  I don't want to be like non-communicative or anything, but it's kind of hard when someone doesn't want to talk to you.  I mean there isn't a lot I can do about anything, and I can't force her to talk.  I didn't even realize there was a problem cause I don't have any problems with her right now.  It just seems that she has some sort of problem with me and it's bothering me that I don't know what it is.  tomorrow I am picking up Mat and going to that Recognition Breakfast.  Finally the moment of truth when I get to open up my awards envelope and see if any other teacher other than my T.A. nominated me for Habits of Mind.  I want that award again this year so badly, that is what I am aiming for.  I worked so hard all year.  You have to have three nominations though, which means that two of my teachers would have to nominate me from the current semester.  I can definitely say I tried very hard, and hopefully two of them did.  Although see the thing is that two of my teachers from last year that nominated me I have this semester.  I don't know if they would nominate me again, but I mean if I have habits of mind one year then I would assume no much would have changed.  So I know I deserve it again.  I think I should stop thinking about it though cause I am going to worry myself too much.  What happens, will just happen tomorrow I guess.  And whatever way things turn out, then that is just the way it's going to be.
