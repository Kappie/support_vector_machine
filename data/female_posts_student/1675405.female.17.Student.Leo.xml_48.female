I stayed home from school and called off of work because I have been feeling horrible the last couple of days, all culminating in this morning's aches. Honestly, I have been so emotionally down this week, I think it spread to a cold. But that's besides the point. When mom came home from work, and brought Sarah and Matthew with her, things all of a sudden turned somewhat upward for me--and I am surprised. I have gotten to the point where I know no one cares, I don't care, and I don't care if I stay like this. It's really gotten to be a permanent part of my life and I don't think it is going to change for a while.   But today, I drove my parents and sister around town, went to Sonshine Corner and found Kenny's birthday gift (God I really miss him today-- I just want to be with him again) which I didn't feel too confident about when I first (reluctantly) decided on it, but am feeling okay now. Then we all went to Chinese which was nice. Matthew wasn't there, indeed, but it still was nice, circumstances considered. We're all at home now watching movies, and it's still nice. I don't know, perhaps its just me sick and dillusional, and I know I'll wake up tomorrow morning and cry because its another day that I don't want to experience, but for now, I'm in this really weird mood. Actually I have the perfect way to describe it: it's like I'm standing in the eye of my latest hurricane of a life, and things are calm, but for only a few minutes before things spiral again. Wow, that's kind of scary. I am really scaring myself.
