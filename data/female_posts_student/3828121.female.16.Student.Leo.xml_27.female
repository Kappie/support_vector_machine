This house is haunted, it's so pathetic, it makes no sense at all. i'm ripe with things to say, the words rot and fall away. if a stupid poem could fix this home, i'd read it everyday.............their anger hurts my ears.....rather than fix the problems, they never solve them, it makes no sense at all. i see them everyday. we get along so why can't they? if this is what he wants, and this is what she wants, then why's there so much pain?*  *And now she's turning off. Now he's shutting down.........These fights, they climb through my veins like it's mercury rising and these nights i seem to remember a home that was better.......this family's breaking down.....*
