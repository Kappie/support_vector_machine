I dont want to call anyone, dont want to see anyone and I really just dont want anything to do with anyone. For some reason I am not feeling to social and fun today. Maybe its the thought of the ortho. appt. I have to go to tomorrow, where I know that he is going to tell me that I cant get them off because of some stupid reason or another. I fucking hate my dentist person. He's an ass. He never even gets my name right let alone actually inform me about what is going on im my mouth. What a fucker!?!?! I'd like to have them off before school starts. Then I could go and get retakes of my school pic so it doesnt have braces. Let's hope it happens. AHHH Now I'm all angered up and I just want to scream. You wouldnt believe how moody my dentist makes me. GRRR... But back to what I was talking about. I dont want to be around people right now. Its just one of those days where I am feeling extremely lazy and crabby. It happens to the best of us.    But one really good thing about tonight is the fact that Nip Tuck is on. The bad thing about that is I wont be having any company :( Normally Amanda and Max join me and swoon the TV but not tonight. Mandy is at her grandmas and who knows what Max is doing but he wouldnt come if its just he and I. Oh well I will watch it myself.   Oh... I cant believe I forgot to tell y'all that I cant go see the Lost Prophets. WAH!! My mom wont let me go to the rave. haha. figures. Oh well. I'm scared of the Rave anyways and I dont really know Lost Prophets' songs and I dont have anything to wear. Maybe some other time when someone I actually listen to comes I will push my mom into letting me but as of now I'm not too bummed. Although it would have been fun to go and listen to the music and hang out with Travis. I guess he'll have to take me to Hilary Duff instead... HAHA I'm joking I dont like her music. I can sing better than her. And that's not saying much.    I talked to Britt today for the first time in forever. It wasnt very long though because she had to go. But it was nice to just say hello and see how things are going for her. I bet she will enjoy the next couple of days and then be happy to return home soon. only 6 more days. I probably wont see her for 7 or 8 but still I am sure she will be happy to get home and see her family and James and hang out with Max before he leaves us for forever. AHHH What are Mandy and I going to do without Max??? He's always the one we call and annoy if we cant find anything to do. It will be so weird when he's gone. Part of the Group will be missing. Amanda and I better start preparing now, or we might go crazy while hes gone.   Well I am going now.   -gabby
