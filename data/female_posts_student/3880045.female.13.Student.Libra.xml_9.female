(in my opinion they looked kinda funny) but owell, who am i to judge? so anthony caught up with them and they talked....skipping all that. but in the end anthony and that HOPE chick started goin out, not her and nicho like it was intended. during some of that time me alex and lauryn went over by a hill and just had fun..not in that way. and then me and her had to go home. then she left to go to her house. and i was at mine...fun fun fun...NOT! yea then alex, kyle, nicho, and anthony showed up and shit started...not gettin into that but lets just say when we all got to alex and kts ppl were kinda sorta in a way stalkin us. now onto the 5th. did nothing really well in the morning. i woke up at 11 again. and talked to katie and she came over. then i talked to mondo trying to work something out and him and alan and miguel came over, it was fun. we all hung out..by the way mondo is really comfortable and smells really good. different story though. and yea. well hours passed and we just goofed around and then my mommy got home. and she took us all to skating. there these guys were being major assholes. grrrrrrrrrrr!! we were gettin so pissed. but got over it in a good time. then we jsut skated and hung out. go figure!!!!! there i got married to kaleigh. yay! lol! and i told mondo wut happened between me and a couple of my friends at my house and i only told him cause i felt really bad about it afterward. and so now were just holding off till skool starts when we see eachother. and miguel and katie go out now too this all happened at skating. so that was my day. and when i got home i got online and talked then kt got on and now i'm on again. so there u have it...........ridas last few days gone by! lol! much luv all!!
