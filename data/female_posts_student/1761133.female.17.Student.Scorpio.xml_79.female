Are you ready to love me?  You see in a way  I have been drifting down a river  To nowhere  And you're giving me nothing  And if you're ready to be my everything  If you're ready to see it through this time  And if you're ready for love then  This I will bring  But I'm not gonna wait for you forever this time  And if you're ready to be  Ready to be my everything  And if you're ready to see it through this time  If you're ready for love then baby  This I will bring  But I'm not gonna wait forever this time  ladayo ladadayo ladeeda   "Everything" By Fefe Dobson
