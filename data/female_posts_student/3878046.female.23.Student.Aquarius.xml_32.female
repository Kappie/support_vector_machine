I'm not special, I'm not good, I'm not even bad, I'm a misnomer, an afterthought of life.
Sometimes I feel nothing, empty, if nobody can see anything in me then surely it must be true.  A waste of space, a large, gaping black hole.
I'm here alone.  I seem unable to fix my life.  I'm an idiot, a dumb little fuck full of pathetic fantasies.  No one sees the scars even when they are physical, scratches along my arms, perhaps they just choose to ignore in general.  I feel I could kill myself, up here in my room and not a soul would notice or care.
