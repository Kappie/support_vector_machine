They had a ton of everclear jello shots, and I had 4 of em, and then I mixed some Hennessy and Hypnotiq (my favorite)...and drank some of that...I was like wtf I'm pretty fucked up. I had a tab too...that's when things really got fucked up. Some guy brought some shrooms over and said he'd give me some if I fucked him. Well...I had taken a tab earlier so...what do you think happened. Well I got the shrooms, and I'm savin' em for lata of course. He also gave me a bunch of ambien, which was pretty cool. Of course he bummed like 5 cigarettes off me, which kinda sucked. Then me and a few guys went down in this dude's basement and smoked a few bowls...that was aight. The rest of the night is pretty much a blur...but when I woke up...I was in this completely different house, laying in a bed with 3 guys I'd never seen before in my life. :-\  I'm not so sure about that. Well this morning, I felt like shit, so I took a couple codeines and now I'm feeling just fine.  Hahahaha I hope you liked that story...it was complete and total BULLSHIT.  Hahaha actually I didn't do much of anything last night. Rofl.  Keep it real, crazies.
