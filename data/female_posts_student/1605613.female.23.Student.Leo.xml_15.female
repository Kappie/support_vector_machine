In the 3rd inning, a shot estimated at 388 feet, cleared the wall in right field. His 3rd hit was a RBI triple off Dennis Cook in the 5th inning. A single in the 6th off Scott Strickland accounted for his 4th hit. Higginson said afterwards that he was "pround of his accomplishment" and that he was "even happier" that his team was able to win the game. The Pirates won both games against the Cubs and currently occupy first place in the NL East.      The Cubs couldn't get Higginson out
