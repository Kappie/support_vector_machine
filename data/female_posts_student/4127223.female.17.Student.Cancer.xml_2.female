So me and brooke made it into town. and im oh so happy, because i bought a really cute fuji camera, and some jewelry. and tried to find a battery for my automatic unlock thing for the car, but i have to order another thing because i put this one through the washer. its like...40 dollars too, so that sucks. but other than that, we ate at a new mexican resturant. called mexico lindo, got some free gum,but the food wasn't  THAT  great. on the way home, i picked up some chupa chups, flan de vanilla, YUM YUM, yo. they're so tasty. lol.       on the other hand of my great day, im kinda frustrated with myself. because i can't understand ratios, and thats the last part of my at home intermediate algebra class. i can't wait to get erick to do it all for me :) mwhahaha. well, till next time...im over and out.
