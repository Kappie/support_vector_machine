Case in point:  The library Office Goddess is one of the best parts of working here.  She's head secretary to the Dean and holder of the key to the supply room.  She's from Texas and has the best drawl I've ever heard and the dry, no-nonsense, shit-kicker sense of humor to match.  She's larger than life.  Literally.    She approached me from behind a few minutes ago as I carefully double-checked the 2004 invoice line item by line item, tapping my shoulder with a packet of Post-its.    "Can I trade a coffee filter for this stack of Menopause Purple Post-its?"  I looked, and sure enough, she held a stack of wonderfully lavender-hued (insert clever description of Post-its without using Post-its again here).  "Menopause purple?"  I said around my guffaw.  "Both my husband's and my mothers painted their rooms this color when they got older, so we call it Menopause Purple."  "It's also Lesbian Pride Purple.  Now, I don't actually have jurisdiction over the coffee filters, but I say go ahead."  I said as she went rummaging through the nearby drawers for said filter.  "You know, Mary Jane, your stunning outfit kinda matches this color."  "I know, I'm starting to like that color and it's worrying me."    "Could be a good barometer..."  (cut to insignificant, continuity-ruining story about a lesbian cousin)  "Did SHE paint her room this color?"   "No, I don't think she painted anything."  "Not much of a lesbian, then."  "Well, she was in Eastern Texas, she probably didn't know how to be one."  (cut to Mary Jane showing off her rainbow-colored socks)  "Those are pretty fancy," I encouraged, already planning this entry.  "We all go through changes..." she said as she made her way back to her throne, two filters (cone-shaped and flat-bottom) in hand.
