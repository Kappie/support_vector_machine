Ant asked why they were waiting when my due date was so soon... they said they couldn't do an unschedualed c-section unless it was to prevent a risk to the baby or myself... blah blah blah  I almost din't go in Sat morning because i was sure i would be sent home.... this time however the nurse (a different one) said that the contractions might not pick up on the machine because of the baby's postion and the size of my stomache... she asked ant to press when i felt a contraction coing on...  well guess what? suddenly all involved realized i WAS'T imagining things after all... then the situation became serious... an hour before a doc said i wasn't dialated at ALL (wasn't i 1 cm yesterday??? hmmm...) in an hours time,  i was four/five centimeters and climbing...  "tonights you're night." said doc  now it as a life/death situation... they were afraid my uterus would burst because i was in HARD labor...   to make a LONG story a tad shorter... Baby Sky was born at 5:17am Saturday morning... He is HEALTHY and sooo cute... dontcha think???   urlLink
