Sorry spanish attack.  Today was a rough monday.  It started off with me going in 45 mins early to school, because somehow last night I figured out that my go cart was going over 5000 kmph.  I was thinking the problem wasn't reffering to a bullet go cart, so I needed help.  I found out that I had just made a stupid mistake, and was done in all of 2 mins, and as I walked out guess what pretty much my entire calss needed help too, so I became designated as their personal tutor.  Oh Joy!    I was doing better, unitl after school, when I went in to start editing the tennis movie, It usually takes a long time to do so, so my teacher has gotten in the habbit of jsut locking whoever is working on it into the room, since she trust us.  So about 10 mins after she left, my computer crashed, which is ok, because I can get it back to the place i need it to be, and the program I was in automatically saves.  So I tried to get back in, and the computer started loading, kept loading for about 10 mins, so I started another computer, to start on my other movie project while the original computer loaded,  the second one loaded for about 10 mins, and I got sick of it, so I left my teacher a note saying help, I don't know what to do.      Then I was on my way home.  And I realized that my dad had given me a free carwash this morning, so I turned around and headed back into town to get my car wash, and when I go there there were two cars in front of me, so it took a while to get in, and I finally got up to the deal to punch in my code, and it had alot more buttons than I had anticipated, so I pushed one, and it was obviously not right, so I finally figured out what to do, and I got my number punched in, and I had my windows rolled up an was ready to go.  I was about ot start driving in, and the thing started talking to me.  So I rolled down my window to see what it was telling me, and I negelected to roll it back up befoer I drove in.  I got just drenched.  Not the brightest move on my part.      It was just one of those days were you have to disbelieve survival of the fittest, because if it were true, I'd be long dead.  Alhtough I did come up with a teen page topic, do teens get enough sleep?  Obviously I don't. (excitment level stable)
