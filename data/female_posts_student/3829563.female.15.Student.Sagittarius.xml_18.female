Justin came over today to watch a movie. okay no one knows justin. he's this kid from across the street, goes to school in orlando. who the fuck goes there anyway. what kind of schools do they have there? well anyway, he came over right, then   he said "oh i havent had any breakfast yet, have you?"  and i said "umm no not quite" (i really didnt though, i swear)   so we went to get breakfast, and we had to cross the street. there were tons of cars. scary, i tell you. I almost turned back. but then again we were just too lazy to walk down to the stupid traffic light. the governement is so stupid. they just  have  to put the damn thing all the way at the bottom. what the fuck is the point? we would have to walk all the way down, cross the street, and walk back up to the damn eatery. so anyway yes. He randomly grabbed my hand and dragged me through the cars. well not really but the point is that he grabbed my hand. and held it. as if we were  going out.  what happened after that, i will just leave unsaid. hes hot, but just not my type. i dont believe in summer flings. and he goes to school in fucking orlando. who does that?   (i really hope he doesnt know about this diary.)   anyway bigger news, i think i might have met the guy of my dreams.... not. but i sawthis sex god on the bus home and he sure made my day even though all he did was smile at me but still.  sex god..  okay. so yes.   i am being forced to go swimming with my aunt tomorrow.  swimming . of all things to do. She asked me today when i was at grandpa's. and i just kind of ignored her but it didnt work. i still have to go. ahhhh and i was thinking of sleeping in.   on a happier note, a sex god smiled at me today.     just got news that a paris hilton look-alike is going to be going to my school. bloody hell.  but hey, a sex god smiled at me, you can't beat that.
