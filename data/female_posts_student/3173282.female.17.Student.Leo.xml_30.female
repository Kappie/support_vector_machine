I'll have a car but i have to get a job and all the money i make will go to pay for my car's insurance and for gas. :(   3. I have to get a checking account?!?!   4. New legal guardians....ehhh!   5. I have to mantain a B average or else i'm back in hell.   6. Possibly have to take Civics next summer because lovely WY doesn't have that class and it's required at CV. ahhh!   7. LOTS of fun times, me n my bestest friends all together again, possibly making a film (hehehe) senior year, baby!! chaospunk and rancidpunk and our love triangle, ooh interesting! Hellz, waht else? Snowboarding on real mountains again!!! YES! camping trips, ski trips, the cabin, cliff jumping, krispy kreme, pop rocks....etc.    Sooo i am really scared about some things and really excited about the rest. Today when my parents told me that they found a family for me to stay w/ (our friends the Foulkes) and all taht stuff about paying for shit i was a little shocked. Then i thought about how its gonna be the day i leave. Whoa, no more parents, no more sister. I dunno...its scary. Sometimes i hate them but i will miss them so much especially my dad. I mean who's gonna be around to try and be ghetto and "hip"?? Well i guess Gary. But something scares me the most. Leaving one person. My bestest boy friend and the person i loved more than anything i ever have. Ahhh hopefully i'll be fiiine. It's been an interesting time here and i've met some interesting people....but some really cool ones too. Well, good night.
