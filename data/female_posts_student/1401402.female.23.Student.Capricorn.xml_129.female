I was his favorite. He once told me that he had confident in me and he was rite. Each day he would always pick on me, giving me a hard time but I was just his favorite one.   Jim, the manager I once got into an argument with awhile ago is relocating to another office in Pleasanton. Before the argument, I didn't like him very much because he was always there to push the button. He would tell me to stop e mailing people and get back to work or smoking is BAD for you or your not working fast enough. People would always tell me that I was his favorite that's why he picks on me.   Then one day something occurs and I hated him so much after that day. But then time pasts by and we somehow got along again. We joke around, specify pathetic things here and there. Today, as he is leaving forever, I gave him the sad puppy face, he turns to look at me and encourage me to be strong and told me he'll be back and that's a promise. With a pat on my back I felt like shedding tears. He didn't look too happy himself but this is what he got to do.   He's gone and I'm feeling sad because there wont be anyone else to spoil me like he did. There wont be anyone around like Jim to pick on me making me hates his guts. I hope he return soon. Man, why am I sad? God damnit!!! Sniffle* sniffle*
