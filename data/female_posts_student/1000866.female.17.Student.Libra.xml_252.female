This kid was being a complete jerk to Alex's sister, and I wanted to see who it was, so I went to his profile, and I like...clicked inside the box, and it sent me to the link that was there, which said, "my profile" or something, and it turned out to be a COMPLETELY disgusting picture. Like, absolutely sickening. I was almost physically ill looking at it. ARGH. It just makes me so mad that there are imature people like that in the world. It really does. I mean, it makes me think, "oh goody, these people are the future of our country." ARGH. I'm just still sick to my stomach thinking about it, and not just the picture, but the whole thing in general. I feel bad for that kid if he has to do that for attention. At least I found out who the kid was so I wont become friends with him. What a jerk. A complete jerk.   Guys are sick. Well, not all, but a lot...are really gross. ARGH. I'm really really frustrated now.
