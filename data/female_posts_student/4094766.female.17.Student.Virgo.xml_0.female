I know that if I lie down my mind will continue to think these thoughts: Where is Greg Why didn't he call Does he still love me Is he lying to me Will we stay together Is Kayla sleeping Will I live through the next month Will I make it thouht school Can I ever be happy Can I ever get away Can I ever just be me Am I fat Can I write Should I call Matt I feel sick I feel bad that I never called JB back Will Wade actually remember to call I miss sitting on Wades floor and doing what we do sitting on Wades floor Should I die my hair back Why is my face freaking out I have so much to get done I should run I should stop caring about other people Do my friends still care about me I miss Oscar Where did that come from I hope no one wakes up I want to eat I am fat Life sucks I cant cut I shouldn't cut I want to cut I hate that I cant spell I think someones up
