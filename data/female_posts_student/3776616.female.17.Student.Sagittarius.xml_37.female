Then I went over to Ken's and talked to his parents then we went down to his part of the house and he showed me his kitchen and bathroom and bedroom and living room and shit.  That was cool, then i got home at 12:30 and the parents didn't say anything so now I'm going to start coming home late every night.  YAY.  anyway, nothing's going on today, mom and kait went to fond du lac and dad and i are staying home.  fun fun
