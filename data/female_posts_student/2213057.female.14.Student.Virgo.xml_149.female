HAH! this is sad. me blogging al the time. no ricki lake, no montel, no nothing. just me and... wow, look at that, ME. if i were to interview myself a year ago, i think i would just walk away after the first phony 'hey!' came from my mouth. i was such an idiot. the things i thought about. and cared about! so stupid. i have come to a conclusion. people can look at me, and judge me and talk about me all they want. i won't take it to heart. unless i really like/love them and they mean something to me... i don't care. everyone is the same when it comes down to it. what i think we need in the world is more homer simpson's. anyways, feel better dylan. and yes, sleep is good.  bekah oh yea, did i mention my team won 4-1 on wednesday with me in net second half (i didn't let the goal in) my coach put me in net even though i think i was dying. stupid.
