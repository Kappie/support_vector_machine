Er ... of course it was all down to my admazing skill, what am I saying about kicking? Nah, sure, it was down to my admazingly clever skil... hmm, oh well, knew that it wouldn't work! Hey, I'm gonna be marked for life with that amazing-admazing thing! Oh and Mr Le Pen was saying how when the students were going on marches in the streets against him (back to the was saying) that their teachers were markist! (or whatever, the word that means when you kind of curve some one's thought and make them think that) *tootally lost!* That is totally wrong! Le Pen is a facist (whatever) racist git! And that's the best description I can give for him right now... hmm... Eek! I missed Neighbours, anyway, John's leaving Ally Mcbeal! :O :O :O Oh my god!!! He's the cool guy who every one sings to!
