The boys and girls beneath me smiled and were cheered, because I was dancing upon the parapet, a pointless protrusion of concrete to run along a case of stairs. It was freestanding, and when I stood beside it at the bottom of the stairs I was shorter than it; at the top I was only barely taller. 	I climbed up upon it and I danced, because it seemed a rather good thing to do. People milled about me on the bare concrete quad, looking up or looking down, smiling when they saw me. It was an amusement, and the weather was clear and still. 	I twisted round and caught squarely among my abdominals a large irregular stone. It was nothing like the geometric lines of the square courtyard; roughly hewn and uneven.  	I tipped backwards from the narrow parapet. My leg flew up in a desperate attempt to redistribute my weight; I tipped backwards. It was an endless moment, in which my limbs flew out and I flew back, following the arched center of my spine. The pink ribbons of my shirt drifted toward the sky as I plunged down to the earth. I was not meant to fly.   	People froze and stared, aghast and horrified. My frantic eyes searched the sky for salvation as they stood helpless, too far distant and too weak.  	 	I land squarely in his arms. He had run from nowhere to stand beneath me when I fell, and together we tumble onto the hard cement. We sit up rattled, pushing my long hair from our faces and untangling our jumbled limbs. I gaze about through the mesh of golden hair which crosshatches my vision. The people, broken from their trances, spill around us in waves of color and flesh, imploring our health and applauding his celerity.  	The rock? It came from over there, we say, and in fury and in rage the thrower is sought.  	He rises, and pulls me up after, and we stand bemused as about us pours the raging pursuit of the malingerer. Stop, I say, I am unharmed and also he. They are a mad amoeba without ears, or certainly without the capacity to digest what falls upon them. It is revelry, and a crazed mob, but what do they seek? It is not for my revenge: I will not have it.  	It must be theirs then, for it is none of mine. But why?
