       
      There is a man beside the church wall, Unable to fight, he can barely crawl, There he stays, day and night, Too poor for food, too tired to fight, He has no clothes, he has no bed, Nothing to rest his weary head, he begs for money from passing people, His hopes as high as the church's steeple, But one one cold winters night he meets his defeat, And all that is left is a corpse on the street.
