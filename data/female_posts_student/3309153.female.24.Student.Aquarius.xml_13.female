Regardless of the stress from last semester, none of us will forget Byron's hand movements during his presentations or Amy's creative hairdos and outfits or my standing, laying on the chair/desk/floor/whatever is available and all the other behaviors that set us apart from the person beside us.  But, now is the chance for those of us who are really writers to come together in a new and refreshing way.  Finally we will have a safe space to express our ideas, to question, to wonder, no matter how "out there" these thoughts may be.  And, we'll have the opportunity to publish together, attend spoken word events, meet authors, poets, musicians, etc.    I was reading "Life As An Adverb" yesterday, and Lee was talking about feeling nervous about going back to the real world, the working world.  I, too, already feel sad about not having school, not being a student who can hide behind that name and make mistakes because of that name: student.  But, we'll be that for each other and not the Survivor Island reality show type of student that many of us felt we were this last semester.  You won't be stranded out there in the intellectual wilderness on your own.    I just want to encourage everyone to really stay dedicated to the group, to become empowered by each other. It will be what we put in to it, and we will grow in every way if each person brings his or her whole self to the table. I know many of us are winding down from school, but I'm trying to look at my first piece as a way to purge.  It's therapeutic!   See you August 2 @6pm at Ashtons.  Oh, and I'd still like some feedback on getting together for a cookout or something at someone's house.  Volunteers?  Didn't Jenny say she could host?  When I get settled into our new house (hopefully by Christmas if not way before) I want to have everyone over! Maybe we can have our Christmas or Winter Holidays party at my house!! Take care,  -Amanda
