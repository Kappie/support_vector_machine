As many of the people I was with noticed: no indians actually work there, and if they did they were super incognito, or just got really good haircuts and traded in all their wampum for a nice 3 piece suit.    The day was disappointing early on to say the least.  I lost about $60 in the first twenty minutes or so that I was there because slot machines are straight up evil.  I learned how to play  urlLink Keno .  Keno is a very useless game.  You don't win a lot of money, its very slow paced and they put you in this living room setting with armchairs filled with old people.  It seems like one of those waiting rooms where people go to die.  Seriously, I must have played for about half an hour all together maybe forty five minutes and I was the youngest person in the room the entire time.  It was me and my boyfriend and then the entire geriatric field trip group from Shady Grove retirement home.    Anyhow, the boyf and I got separated from the people we'd orginally come with and began to wander in search of food.  In our travels we ended up finding them and ate some entirely overpriced and not particularly delicious buffet where I saw the biggest abuse of a  urlLink rascal scooter  known to man.  Some gigantic el slobo fatty was rolling around in it from buffet station to station with his awful army green shirt riding up his gelatinous gut the entire time.  For christ's sake, cover that thing up!  After our disgusting lunch and after I'd chucked my cookies (note to self: don't eat crabcakes at an Indian casino that is nowhere's near any body of water) we decided we were ready to hit the tables for some rockin' gaming action.  We passed up black jack, spanish 21, roulette and baccarat for one game and one game only: Casino War!!  Yes, that's right, I said War, like W-A-R spells war, like you learned when you were little.   urlLink Casino War  owns your ass, and is a GREAT way to get cash when you're down.  I don't think there is any where else in the casino that any of us could have turned $20-40 into $200 and had so much damn fun doing it!  If only that bastard asian man with bad breath hadn't sat down next to the boyf and taken all the good cards, we all prolly would have come out winners.    Moral of this story:  if you're ever strapped for cash in upstate CT make sure you go to mohegan sun and sit your ass down at the Casino War table and get your win on.
