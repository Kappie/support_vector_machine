She thought meaty sounding names weren't appropriate for vegan recipes. I wondered if she had a problem with only the names or also the fact that some of the recipes were imitations of meat/dairy/egg dishes.  Is this really such a bad thing? I don't think so. Many, and in fact I think it's fair to say most, people are not vegans from birth and come to veganism after years of eating meat and dairy. Just because they have decided to stop eating animal products due to animal welfare, environmental, religious, or health reasons does not mean that they automatically stop liking the flavors of these foods. Knowing that there are vegan options that provide the tastes they remember and enjoy can help them to not only make an easier transition, but to stay with it in the long run.  Honestly, if you were a new vegan, which recipes would sound more appetizing to you - Manhattan 'Clam' Chowder or Vegan Seaweed Soup? Barbecue 'Ribs' or Barbecue Wheat Protein? 'Chicken' Stew w/ Dumplings or Bean Curd Stew w/ Dumplings? No matter how good the recipe might be, no one is going to try it if they are turned off by the name!  Personally, I like familiar sounding recipes. I like the tastes they provide and the memories they invoke. I have very strong associations with certain foods from my omni days - recollections of my father, in particular - and I would hate to give them up just because I choose not to eat meat anymore. Vegan analogues, whether store-bought or homemade, ensure that I don't have to. I can still have my Huskies In A Drift [Brit: Toad In A Hole] and remember my father and the dinner with the sausages and the axe.  But that's a story for another day.
