Opinions, opportunities, abilities and feelings. They all change. Far  too often , if you ask me. I'm always different. And everywhere I go, it's different the next time I come. Everyone I meet is different the next time I meet them. That's the thing about being a kid.  Which I consider myself to be.   Everyone changes. We're all so easily influenced.   For example. One year ago, the only music I ever listen to was RB and Hiphop, sometimes soul. I hated everything else. Not because I actually disliked it, but because I was in that crowd. The stuck up, mean, wannabe black,'I'm better than you' crowd. And trust me,  I wasn't particularly happy in that clique . I only had 3 friends that I considered real ones.   Now I have 10 friends like that. That I love with all my heart. I love all sorts of music (except for Country and Techno music). And I'm  happier . It was a hard transition, though.  This past year has been   the best year of my life  , but it has also been the  hardest . I feel that I'm so much closer to finding myself. I'm not there yet, though.  But I've come a long way. No matter how hard it was to face my feelings towards myself. Facing them was nothing compared to actually trying to beat them, though. I haven't beaten them yet, sadly. That's going to take some time. I need time to like myself. I have to like myself in order to really like others. I know that's some  stupid psycho babble bullshit  but I actually  believe it .   Another thing I believe is that every decision we make, we've already decided. Every decision is decided for already, by ourselves. We always want one or the other. Doubt is just ourselves feeling guilty...  Did that make sense?  Who cares....? haha. I know what I meant, and I am the only person who has to get it.   Now I have to go back to reality.   My journey of finding myself  .
