I havent had much time to chat, catch up on your blogs or even post here since I've been slingin' latte's full time, but its good for me.  So far in this last week I've lost 5 lbs.  I am always on my feet running around instead of being sedentary behind a desk all day and I don't have to worry 'bout my arms 'cause repeatedly lifting gallons of milk is good for buildin' biceps.  To hell with the gym:  I'm gonna go do some milk curls!   Haha.  Anyhow, Projekt Revolution tour last friday was pretty cool.  Less Than Jake and the Used were good, it sucked that more people weren't into them.  Snoop was pretty good (even if he *did* think he was at Jones Beach and not PNC), Korn.  God, Korn rocked my fucking face off (no, they weren't the headliners, wtf!) and they did a really kick ass cover of the Wall.  Rock on Jonathan Davis, you kilt wearing -tearing shit up- badass mothafucka!  Linkin Park I really hate.  I probably hate them more now that I've seen them live than I did prior to this, but there was one cool part of their set:  Jay-Z.  Yes, Jay-Z.  Hova, Jigga, Sean Carter, whatever you wanna call him.  He came out on set and did 3 songs with LP.  No, none of them was 99 problems.  He did "Dirt off your SHoulder", "Big Pimpin" and soemthing else that was good, but for some stupid reason I can't recal right now.  The hillcrest luau was the party of the fucking year.  We pulled it off it rocked everyone in attendance agreed it was the most festive of all festivals.  What is it about tiki torches, hawaiian shirts and jungle juice that really gets people partying?  What happened at the Luau stays at the Luau so if you missed it I guess you'll just have to wait patiently for the invite to next year's bash.    Other than that, I've just been working and watching Andrew play hockey, so I guess that'll do it for this installment.  I promise to catch up with all of you as I'll only be at work until 10 a.m. tomorrow (see, going in at 5 a.m. *does* remotely have its benefits...who am I kidding!) so I'll catch you all on the flipside.  Be good and send me emails (dynamitediva628 at yahoo dot com) so I can feel special.  I promise to write back to 'em.  Love you all!  *mWaH!*
