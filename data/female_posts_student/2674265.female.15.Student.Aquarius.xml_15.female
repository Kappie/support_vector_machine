YOu see when i clean then i take everyting out of my closet and then reorginize it. i can do it like well any random time im in the mood and it takes about two weeks so i started that about two days ago adn everything is a desater. its just worse utill its done and then its perfect and then a week later its all bad again. I do it like once every two months and every time i coem out with one to two bags of stuff im going to get rid of its so sad. i cant find my Dirty Dancing soundtrack. its driveing me crazy cause you get in touse moods when you want to listen to something and you cant find it and it really sucks. Oh well i guess i can listen to motown.ill find it cause sooner or more so later ill orginize my cds and then ill ifnd it. well i got to work on my room so laterness. bye
