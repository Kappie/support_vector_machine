Anyway, my back aches now. This guy in my English class told me he found the site too.  At this rate, the entire class of 2005 will be reading it by graduation.  I wonder if I. has found this or not.  Hope not.  Speaking of English, we had a sub that was one of the teachers in our middle school, and I found out why everyone loves her.   Well I have two jokes.  Here they are:  Little Sammy was praying to God one night before sleeping, and his parents overheard him.  He said, "God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless Grandma, goodbye Grandpa."  The next day, Grandpa dropped dead of a heart attack.  A few months later, the boy said in his prayers, "God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, goodbye Grandma.  Grandma died instantly of a bus hitting her the next day.  About six months later, Sammy prayed, "God bless Mommy, goodbye Daddy."  Of course, Dad was plenty freaked out.  He used the utmost caution at work and took 45 minutes to make the 10 minute commute from work.  When he arrived home, his wife greeted him at the door and said, "You know, it's the strangest thing...today the mailman dropped dead on our sidewalk!"  And the second: A tourist was browsing Chinatown, admiring the signs, restaurants and shops.  He rounded a corner and noticed a shop entitled "Lars Olaffson Laundry."  Puzzled, he went inside and asked for the owner.  A Chinese man stepped up and asked him why he asked.  "How did you get a name like Lars Olaffson for your business name?"  "Is name of business owner," the man replied.  The man replied, "When I come to this country, I wait in line for Documentation.  A big blonde Swede stand in front of me.  'What's your name?' they ask.  'Lars Olaffson,' he say.  'What's your name?' they ask me.  'Sem Ting.'  Lol!!!  WAIT!  Don't shake your head and comment on how unfunny those are!  I've got more: A man received a call from his doctor.  His doctor informed him that he had bad news and worse news.  The bad news: he's going to die tomorrow.  "What's worse," the doctor said, "I couldn't reach you yesterday!" (yeah, it's kind of stupid but oh well.)  A pollster was taking opinions outside the United Nations building in New York City.  She met a Saudi, a Russian, a North Korean, and a New Yorker.  "Excuse me, what do you think of the current meat shortage?"  The Saudi said, "What's a shortage?"  The Russian, "What's meat?"  "What's an opinion," asked the North Korean.  Asked the New Yorker, "What's 'excuse me?'"  Ok, you can leave now.  I'll have to come up with better jokes tomorrow.  Later.    You are an ERASER! You spend your time helping people smooth over their mistakes.  It's a messy job, but you have the helpful attitude to get it done.  Your coworkers appreciate that you are so friendly and non-judgmental, but make sure they aren't taking advantage of your expertise. If you don't make people clean up their own mess from time to time you'll always be covered in dirt that isn't yours (and that's not fair to you because your kindness is so valuable).    urlLink   What Piece of Office Supplies Are You?
