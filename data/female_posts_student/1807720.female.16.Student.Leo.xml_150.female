I got a date tonight - Edi, and well lots of stuff to do.  I still have to put on my make-up too.  I am sooooo excited!!!  This upcoming weekend is so incredibly booked, I have like NO time.  I don't know when I will study and when I will do homework.  I am going to be up til 2:00 AM at this rate!  LOL!  And it's officialy my drivers test is booked for Saturday April 10, at 12:30.  I am keeping it on the down lo just in case I don't do well, but I have confidence in myself and really think that I can do good.  I know I can do good actually.  Anyways I have to go review some Bio and I have English to do, and make-up to apply.
