It was kinda scary. I think they were all showing parts of my life though. First it was the parts of my life that I'm ashamed of...and there were no walls in my house and everyone could see in, and it was really messed up. Then I was in my car, and the brakes weren't working and I was going down this steep parking lot. Then I got out of the car and I was really scared and my mom was crying and she was like "I should have believed you...I should have...I'm sorry...I love you" That was really messed up. Then I was at this...banquet of some sort. This one girl came up to me and started yelling at me because she said I was at some party and I was seducing her boyfriend. And I wasn't...and it didn't make any sense. And she was going psycho and everyone at the thing was staring at us...and I was trying to explain that it wasn't me because I wasn't even there. But someone had set me up and then this guy came around with a knife and I was trying to get away...etc. There were all these little details that encompassed every single worry or concern in my life. EVERY single thing. Every minor detail was somehow fit into this dream. It was really manic and crazy and I woke up very edgy. I still feel edgy. Like I'm on the rise to a climax in my life.  I don't feel right anymore.  I mean...I'm fine. But I feel on the edge. I think I need rest. I need to find some way of escaping...but my life is too busy to warrant that any time soon.  I watched requiem for a dream tonight too. Haven't watched that in ages.  Summer's really close and I'm not ready for it yet.  I've got to start getting in order...and I might as well start right now. This very instant.  I need my mom to call that phony doctor too and see why on earth he wants me to have this surgury and go on this stupid treatment for something that I don't even have.  I need to start eating better and working out. I can start that now.  I need to get through this last push of school, keep up and just get it out of the way so that I can enjoy my summer.  I need to relax and party and have a good time.  I'm going to go make a to-do list...and I'm actually gonna stick with it.  Adios crazies.
