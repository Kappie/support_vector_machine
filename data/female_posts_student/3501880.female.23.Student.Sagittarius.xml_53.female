I like being clean, and that usually wins out over not showering, but the amount of energy that it takes to get to the point of showering just seems to be mentally exhausting sometimes.  It really isn't so much the showering part, but all that shit you have to do AFTER the shower to: towel off, search for clean underwear, search for the cleanest clothing on the floor, wash face, put on lotion, dry hair, put on make-up, blah, blah, blah...It just seems like so much wasted time on a daily basis to go through.
