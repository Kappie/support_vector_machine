Obviously as 35 was the average age there were also some OLD men in there... I swear I saw a man in his 60s doing the two-step!!! I had a good ole laugh...especially when two brothers in there were giving these two Oriental girls a little too much attention...okay one of them was well put together but the other looked like..... let me see.....Well let me put it like this......if China ever felt the need to broadcast their own version of "Family Matters" there would be no need to hold a casting session for the role of Steve Eurkel (Am I bad?????)
