Tuesday I spent the night with Crystal  Corey. We got caught in this  huge  storm, we were on the interstate and we couldn't see a thing, so we went to Kevin's parent's house until the storm let up. Then today we went to the Huntington Mall and Billy Bob's. We road the carosel or w/e with Corey. He is such a gooood baby. He didn't cry once`!! At Billy Bob's he laughed soo hard at the Bears. I wish i had my camera. It was the cutest thing ever`!  Riight now i'm talkin' to Miike. He's such a cool guy. despite all the rumors, i still like him. I've decided that if i meet a guy, and then sum1 tells me something about them, im not gonna listen. I'm not goin' to base my opinion on sum1 from what sum1 else thinks. I think that i need to form my  own  opinion of the person.
