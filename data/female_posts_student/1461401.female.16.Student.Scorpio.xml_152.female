As my song comes on, the steady beat of the rain on the skylights back it up, and suddenly, my headache isn't so terrible anymore. Tomorrow doesn't seem as daunting, and english seems a bit more doable. My song ends, and the sound of the rain becomes less and less, but the feeling stays. It's like a nice, soft fuzzy, shading my eyes in a blanket of warm fatique. Yes, this isn't a bad thing.
