RED DEATH  From the moment the keys were thrown away, one shy woman began to feel intimidated, a cold shiver ran up the inside of her spine. As this awkwardness grew inside her, she tried to tell others only to have them sneer at her pathetic insecurities… after. All what was there to worry about when Red Death was outside… 	As they all rejoiced in escaping red deaths wrath, the celebrations continued long into the nights. As Prince Prospero and his thousand-man army enjoyed their women, wine and entertainment the shy woman wondered through the crowd, and as she watched everyones joy and sense of victory, a smirk emerged on her face. 	During these parties, she kept a close eye on the Prince. Her passion towards him growing by the day. As much as she loathed his confidence and sureness, she was drawn in by the power of his handsomeness and his courage. Shy envied the object of his affections Lady Amelia,  she watched her as she ever so gracefully flirted with him, but pulled away drawing him in more every time and kept thinking that it should be her. 	Weeks passed and the celebrations continued, incessant laughter spread through the castle. With the prince as their leader, they had all survived and red death was all but forgotten in their drunken nightly escapades.  The shy girl had remained unheard and unseen especially by the prince. Nightly as everyone slept, she would sit in her room gazing out at the night sky and wait. 	One morning everyone in the castle all awoke to quite a scuffle. And like a little herd of school children everyone including the shy girl followed the crowd to this magnificent elegant ballroom. There stood Prince Prospero on top of the main feasting table with a massive smile upon his face. He took a deep breath and the enormous crowd did with him. “In three weeks it is the anniversary of my great mother Queen Sylvias death and since no one had entered this castle before us after the devastating tragedy in three weeks we will have her wake and celebrate my mother’s term as queen. On this day I will also officially take my seat in the royal throne and become King Prospero” bellowed Prince prospero  Shouts and cheers of glory came flooding through the crowd the excitement began to stir. Prince Prospero continued “To celebrate we are going to have a masked ball in this very ballroom” Ooooohs and aaaaaaaahs emerged from the guests as their eyes circulated the ever-elegant ballroom. Chandeliers filled with crystal and gold encrusted hung from the rafters. 	As the prince dismissed the eager crowd conversations about what they were going to wear, shoes make up and hair began amongst the females. There were two that were looking forward to it most of all though. Lady Amelia and the very shy woman, both in the back of their minds thinking that it was the night they were going to make the Prince theirs.  PART 2 RED DEATH PART 2- THE MASKED BALL  Anticipations were growing, the ball was to be tomorrow night. In his room the prince was trying on his custom made outfit and enjoying a glass of chardonnay when he heard a shriek from down the corridor. 	 The prince sent a few of his men to investigate and as the men neared the area which the scream was coming from they gasped in shock and hurriedly ran back to the prince. Trying to explain the men couldn’t speak, as they stuttered and fell over their words the prince became frustrated “worthless fools” he exclaimed and went to see for himself. As he approached the room he slowed his footsteps, creeping the door open he turned to see a blood covered wall engraved in which was his name. The Prince fainted. Aware that what he saw could not possibly be true, was the Red Death here? 	When the Prince came to the blood on the wall was gone without a trace, the men tried to comfort him but they thought him a little delusional because the name they saw engraved in the wall was not the Princes but the deceased Queen Sylvia. After hearing this news the Prince started to panic. He tossed and turned in his four post bed all night. Could his dead mother still be here? Is the castle really haunted or is she here only to plague revenge on her assassinator? He rested his eyes but slept with one eye open all night. 	 	 In a midst of all the confusion in the middle of the night the shy girl had began wondering around the castle in search of something special. The Queens Old room. As she crept around she finally found two massive big doors that she hadn’t noticed before, she had found it, the room the Queen was assassinated in. Marvelled by the beauty the shy girl found the room just as it had been left, beautiful covered in jewels, but as she wandered near the Queens bed she gasped. Here on the bed lie the most magnificent ruby she had ever seen. Set in a heart shaped necklace she picked it up and placed it around her neck. “He’s sure to notice me now” she exclaimed as she looked at her reflection in the mirror. Just as she placed it around her neck she heard a shriek from down the corridor, she ignored it and continued marvelling at her reflection in the mirror. Hurriedly she scurried back to her room with a brilliant glowing smile upon her face. 	The next morning the castle was a buzz with the news of the night before. Many were worried it signalled the return of their all but forgotten red death  but both the shy girl and Lady Amelia had other things on their mind and were laughing and joking in their anticipation for the ball. Both had devised plans to capture the Prince’s heart. The shy girl only hoping that the red gem, as she had appropriately named it the hope ruby would help her in her endeavours.  RED DEATH – PART 3  The night was approaching quickly, and everyone was getting done up in their elegant gowns. The shy girl had an elegant crimson and black number, just perfect to match the beautiful gem she was wearing around her neck. Lady Amelia was covered by diamonds and wearing a gorgeous gold dress to suit the occasion.  	Everyone gathered in the dining room. Lady Amelia determined to have all the attention wandered in fashionably late. As she entered the room everyone’s head turned, including the prince. She was surrounded by a circle of admirers, the shy girl who had been ignored up until this point decided to remake her entrance, full of confidence. With the hope ruby on display she gracefully entered the ballroom. This time however she did get a reaction, gasps of shock and amazement at her beauty arose from the crowd and the Prince. Who was this young beauty and why had he never noticed her before.  	Well Amelia didn’t like this, how dare this unknown character take away her limelight, she pushed through the crowd eager to see who it was. When she got to the front she stopped dead in her tracks for this beautiful girl was none other than her little sister, Jacinta. And as Jacinta noticed the look of surprised the very same smirk come about her face as did the very first night in the castle. 	Amelia was the really jealous type, she noticed the red ruby around her sister’s neck and recognised it as the one she saw lying on the queen’s bed. Knowing that she could not say that she two had been in the queen’s room to see this she ever so sarcastically asked Jacinta where she could have got such a gorgeous piece of jewellery.  With an ease of confidence about her she said that it had belonged to her mother, their mother and she had found it beside her after she died of the Red Death. 	Amelia without thinking questioned this, accusing Jacinta of stealing it from the queen’s room. At this remark everyone stopped and turned to face the bickering siblings. The prince stepped forward to try and sort out this dilemma between the two only to be knocked out of the way as Amelia flew at her little sister. “You were always the ugly one how dare you try and ruin my night” Amelia screamed. As she got nearer to her sister she flung out her arms in hope of stealing the hope ruby. Jacinta full of rage screamed, it was a scream that could have trembled the castle walls and as she did this the crowd gasped, as a ray of light shone from the ruby placing the entire kingdom in a trance it directed itself towards Amelia. Amelia began to laugh, louder and louder “you don’t know what your doing Sis you have no idea” She chuckled as Jacinta continued to scream.  They collapsed. Slowly but surely Jacinta again began to rise. Amelia was left on the floor, drowning in her own blood just as red death had left so many others. The frightened crowd new nothing to what was going on. Suddenly still with the ruby around her neck Sylvia raised off the ground. “you don’t deserve him skank’ she seemed to scream in her own voice but her eyes began to turn red and the next time she spoke it was loud, it was furious and her eyes lit up like they were on fire. “I’m back” said the voice with a giggle the prince immediately knew what was going on. “You thought you had gotten rid of me didn’t you son” and there was another giggle. At these words the prince himself became furious. His mother, in Jacinta’s body was trying to reap revenge on him as she had tried to on the whole prospero kingdom. Grabbing the nearest thing he could find, a candelabra. Jacinta / Sylvia looked up at him rather oddly and in this brief moment he took a chance and threw it at her, aiming at the necklace.  	Time almost seemed to freeze as it travelled along in the air, everyone sat there mouths open and as it connected they all gasped. But it didn’t connect with the ruby, He missed, it hit the possessed Jacinta straight in the head. The prince saw the opportunity and took it lunging at her. The two tackled on the ground for a while until the ruby began dislodged and slid across the dining room floor. No- one knew what to do. The queen began to scream out “ it is me your queen my son here murdered me to take the throne please protect that stone it is all that keeps me here today”  The prince counteracted this screaming back “ don’t you see that she is the red death, the stone is anyway haven’t you noticed it had not taken any lives until my mother and this stone re-emerged” the crowd stood there bewildered until a third plea, one that they had not expected emerged. It was the voice of young Jacinta pleading for help.  As both the crowd and Jacinta, well the Queen   seemed to be paralysed the prince dived towards the ruby and swung at it. He smashed that beautiful gem into thousands of little pieces. Releasing the spell on Jacinta and destroying what was left on both his mother and the Red Death. He ran up to Jacinta who was lying on the floor, drained checking to see if she was fine. But as he looked at her, and gradually at everyone else in the room he saw blood leaking out of ears, eyes and noses of everyone, and as the fear began to run through him he reached up and touched his nose. It was bleeding.
