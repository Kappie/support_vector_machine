I held your hand so tight afraid that I might lose my grip The sweat that trickled down my wrists was empty filled with fear Cried so many times that night I think that I’ve run out of tears I don’t think I’ve ever met anybody that was quite like you You embraced my heart to touch don’t know how you do the things you do You listened as I told you how my life is dark and cold You took a brush and painted the dark with vivid colors bright and bold You magically turned my world around the other way Took my breath and all the thoughts I was about to say You gave the wings back to the butterfly so that it could go on home As I watch him fly I finally knew that I was not alone You gave me a rose so delicate, I touched the thorns and then I bled Taught me how to look pass these thorns to find the beauty of it instead When the stars fell from the sky you caught it and put it back in place The star once trembling began to gleam with radiance and grace  Told me that tonight is the night to embrace and that time is not too late Then I understood how to learn to  love instead of learn to hate For the first time in awhile I smiled and found it not that hard Despite the ugly past I hold I see pass the brutal scars Who are you where you came from it doesn’t matter anymore I learned to see and feel like I never did before Maybe you’re a vision, an angel sent down from up above Don’t leave me here don’t let me go for I need you to love
