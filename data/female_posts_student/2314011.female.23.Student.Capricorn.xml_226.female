It's not the same as the original, from the box, cooked on the stove Mac  Cheese, but it'll do on Sunday afternoon spent at the office.    Just compensating for this Friday's absence, which will be spent in Boise celebrating the semester's victories with Mom before the big wedding on Saturday.  Should be quite the event.  Have a cousin's new baby to ohh and ahh over; have another cousin's new pregnancy to pretend to be excited about; Grandma and Grandpa will be missing on account of the latter's recent open-heart surgery; and the after-wedding party with the newlyweds at a dueling piano bar.  Score.    So yea, just me in the big ol' empty office.  Brought my laptop along so I could download the iTunes program using the school's wi-fi.  Decided yesterday that I wanted a new Summer Mix.  Something other than the fabulously brand new Mixes the Boy is cooking up.  This will be a retrospective: Summer's Greatest Hits.  There's some hugely guilty pleasures, some classics, some new faves and some long-forgotten yet greatly beloved archetypes.  Accordingly, some songs had to be hunted down on the internet and (sigh) paid for.  Can't wait to get home, put it together and give it its first listen doing some long-overdue yoga.    After watching Game 4, that is.  Go Pistons.
