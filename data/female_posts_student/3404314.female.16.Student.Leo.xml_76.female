"whoa!!! you made reviewers for these subjects" she went here last tuesday to treat me out.. coz i did her a  "little"  favor!!! yah ryt?! little? i even got colds because of that... i told her that i needed a break from the reviewing that i did.. so we watched never been kissed!! honestly, it was the first time i watched that flick!! sobra kong kinilig.. maybe because i was really tired.. haii.. david arquette really looks good.. krishna just had to agree with that!!!        jodette's fone was lost a while ago.. inside burger king.. everything happened so fast!! i did pity her coz she was crying!! there was this creepy gut who tagged me and told me that my 20 peso bill dropped.. i told him that it wasnt mine,.. but he insisted.. then after 5 mins.. i told jodette to see if ruby texted.. then that was the time we realized...  it was gone!!!  just like that!!!        have to go.. blog later!!! miss u ol!!!!
