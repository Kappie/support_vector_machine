Which is unusual, and always vaguely interesting since my dreams are usually so whack.  I'd like to know what they mean about my psyche (maybe I really am a crazy person).  Ah well.  So begins another week in the lab.  I have some tedious work to do today, like going through boxes in search of Bos and washing other stuff, but that means that I'll be back to coding for the next few days, at least.
