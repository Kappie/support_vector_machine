Her dad finally got out of the hospital yesterday. He feels much better. He's probably going to have to get chemo, but it's the kind that won't make him sick. The funniest thing happened last night! When me and Becky got in a fight the other day, the main reason she was mad was because me and Noelle are good friends and she's jealous. Well, last night Becky called me when I was with Katie and she asked me if I wanted to go to the beach with her today and I was like, "Ummm, Sorry, I can't do anything tomorrow, I'm doing something with...Noelle" It was so awkward! I was going to lie and say I was busy with someone else, but then I realized that there is no reason for me to lie. If Becky is jealous, that's her problem. I'm not doing anything wrong. It was really weird though. I just felt like hanging up on her instead of saying that I was going to be doing something with Noelle. Anyway, I looked at Deanna's profile before and she wrote something about "John" and I have no idea who he is. I need to call her today and find out. I slept over Maria's house the other night. I haven't seen her in like two years. It was pretty fun. It was a little awkward at times, but not too much. I missed her. I hope she had a good time. I'm really excited because she gave me a copy of her prom video. I watched it with Katie and it was so weird to see all these people from my old school who I haven't seen in so long. It actually made me kind of sick. I saw a lot of people who I didn't get along with. Oh well. I have to go get ready to go to Noelle's house. See ya!
