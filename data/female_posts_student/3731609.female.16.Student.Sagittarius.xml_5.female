Each seat had their own personal screen where you could choose from a number of movies, play games, or watch downward looking camera, among other things. Very entertaining. We arrived in Stockholm, picked up our car, and drove to Uppsala. We ended up driving the wrong way on some streets because the road signs are different and they took a while to get used to. Our hotel had beautiful wooden floors and fluffy feather comforters. Little did I know this would be commonplace in the hotels we would be staying at. We visited the oldest church in Scandinavia, pretty impressive for a church, very decorative. We also walked down the cobblestone streets window shopping. Great place, I must say.   On the way to Kirsten's (a second cousin) we saw some ancient burial mounds. They were also impressive. I mean they were basically hills, but I had a good time. We stopped in a small town, Horndal, where my father proceeded to steal a poster with a ping-pong champion Anna Berglund (a relative of mine) on it. We decided not to return to that town.   Kirsten spoke English very well as did her children Linda and Terese, and her husband, Kenneth, although they all thought they were horrible. Linda was really funny. When I asked her what St. Lucia was about she replied, "Fucking religion."   Kirsten and Kenneth made breakfast and guess what we had one time...horse!   When we went to our rooms in an apartment down the street we saw a woman with dark old-fashioned clothing on. By old-fashioned I mean high collars, butt enhancer things (I don't know what they are called...sorry). Kirsten said that they were kind of looked down on because they weren't viewed as trust-worthy. She also said that her non-violent/safe town didn't react well to the Gypsy moving in. Someone broke the windows on her car, trying to drive her out. Kind of sad.   The next day we met relatives. None really spoke English very well. Leif was one of them...very cool guy, funny too. (Kirsten translated). Karl-Inge was another relative. He made a nickel-harpe (some stringed instrument) and played it for us. There was also this incredibly old lady named Astrid Berglund (Astrid! I love it! It's a sign!) who was married to Bengt (Bengt! I love it! It's a sign!).   Kirsten taught us some words that night, like sprattlegubbe (jumping jacks), mygg (mosquitoes). And I ate horse for breakfast!? Kind of bizarre, tastes like ham.   The Euro-Cup was going on while we were there. We watched some of the games with Kenneth, a football enthusiast to say the least. When he couldn't explain a call in English he would get frustrated and would call Kirsten to translate.    Goteborg was next. Goteborg was quite the modern city. I had a lot of fun walking around, shopping, you know how it is. There were a lot of malls and shops. Sweden was playing in the Euro-Cup that night and my father thought it would be a good idea to go to a pub, to experience the feel of the true fans. Boy was he right, there was cheering and screaming and so forth. Luckily Sweden won, because otherwise, I would have feared for my life.   The next day we went to an amusement park, quite like Michigan Adventure. I rode all of the big rides. Fun times.   The next stop was Stromstad, a beautiful, tiny fishing town right on the rocky shoreline. We also stayed in a beautiful hotel with two bathrooms, wooden floors, a balcony the size of my room, and two floors with a spiral staircase connecting them. The balcony looked right out onto the bay. It was amazing! We drove for a while to the only fjord in Sweden, then climbed a lot of the rocks so we could see water for about 270 degrees. I wanted to stay there forever, as cliche as it sounds.   After leaving Stromstad we visited a castle/fortress. It was beautiful as well, and had an amazing view over intersecting rivers. It was quite windy at the top of the towers. I was wearing my sandals (hey, I thought there would be flat ground), and I slid all over the cobblestones. At the top of one tower I could smell brownies. Later I learned there was a cookie factory several miles away.   There was another castle (although I canâ€™t remember quite when we visited). We could only go into part of it because there were no more English tours, but it was interesting.   Next was Stockholm (through Norway). Stockholm was quite the town, right on the river. It was beautiful. We watched another soccer match between Sweden and Italy (which ended in a tie). The Italians were...let's just be honest here...beautiful and quite enthusiastic. When Italy scored they were cheering...kissing the screen, and when Sweden scored a few stomped out muttering words under their breath.   We visited the Drottingham theater as well as the palace in Stockholm.   Old Town, in Stockholm, seems just that-old, with new shops. I had a good time just walking around, looking at things. Then we came back...      You can find the pictures at  urlLink http://hannahspictures.photospot.com
