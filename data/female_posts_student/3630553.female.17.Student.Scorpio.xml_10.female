I think watching horror movies are cool, especially when you see people around you freaking out and creeping out from fear. Movies with ghosts whispering the character’s name, zombies looking like garbage, immortals chasing mortals, and demons burning in hell are magnanimously creative. Although some visuals are just neither that realistic nor that convincing, horror movies are hard to imagine. Horrific scenes are brutally clever and artistic. And the hardest task, I suppose, is to draw psychological impacts within the story that would make the viewers remember the creepy segments they’ve seen, and sometimes even relating those segments in their habitual lives.
