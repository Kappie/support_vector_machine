       
      I want everyone to feel a tug toward each other and give meaningful glances and love recklessly and carefully and with aching in our sides. I want every night, there to be a low-lit punk-rock Christian concert with us jumping and headbanging and laughing for God and each other and the good good music-drums. I want relationships to be easy and passionate and comfy as a couch set in the sand by a blue-gray sea where we could sit and watch kids with umbrellas twirl the pinks into the sky and our souls. I want to taste the Lord and people – do they taste like sweet cream or apple Kool-aid pops or pizza? I want to know.   And I know God is here in my carpet or something and I never feel lonely, because somehow I can light a candle or just the Christmas lights in my room, put on Switchfoot, and smell God in the glowing dusk. I’m too deliriously happy because there’s not too much guilt anymore, just freedom, bare feet, and open windows to the night breeze. I don’t ask, won’t anyone ever see me sometime soon, and want it. Not anymore. I have enough great things already around me. And love comes in so many forms. Sort of like water. I like them all. What I already have is more than good enough.    To whomever is stirring up the goodness, you are doing a good job. The stars fill the sky quite nicely in my head, behind my eyes, and way up there. Oh, all around me.
