God knows what you're going to do, how you're going to go, what decisions you'll make, but that shouldn't give you an excuse for bad habits. Just because He knows what's going to happen doesn't mean that's the way he wants it to be, "savvy"? (Miss V wishes me to express her skepticism in my belief in a higher power. But that's the way she was brought up to think.)      Ah, yes, Anime. You know, I kinda quit paying attention to that when I found a ton of other things to think about. You know, well-being of my world, how my friends are doing (and what trouble they've gotten into lately), grades and school, etc. But, yes, I suppose I can figure what you're talking about. (Though I'm much more of a Star Wars person. Jar Jar and John Williams all the way!)      C. Sparrow, I think you need to give Mr. K a rather exact definition of the word "savvy". (Remember: proper capitilization can help to convey a clear and concise meaning!)
