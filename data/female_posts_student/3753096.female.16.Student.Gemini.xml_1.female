The gum is now spanning one hand to another, with a clump at either end.  I resemble this because I'm feeling pulled into Chrisianity, and feeling pulled into the secular.  I like my music, but I like the peace I know He can bring.  I'm at a very weird place; I totally believe the Bible and agree with the principles and theology of Christianity, but won't 'succumb' to the urgings because I want to keep some things in my life.  I think music is my biggest thing.  Modern rock, for the most part, isn't following Christian guidelines.  There are some pretty good Christian bands - some have made it big (Evanescence, Switchfoot, Chevelle) but there's so much more selection in the secular.  I don't like being where I'm at, either.  Part of this (I'm paraphrasing) is my being uncomfortable with the statement, "You cannot serve two masters. Be hot or cold, cuz if you're warm, I'll spit you out." Ooo. I also don't like the indecision, and angst over trying to decide one way or another. I want to love him with all of my heart... but I like what I have now as well. Everytime I go to church I feel a pull - I've felt a presence - and then I come home, and do things that totally negate that. I'm kind of just watching myself wander all over the sidewalk right now.
