I tried very hard to smile,joke,laugh and talk to her like normal but i dun feel like i am still so close to her.Why is it that, just one message made my impression change totally.Whenever i think of it, i will still cried like shit.No one understand how i feel or what i had gone through.I felt very lonely sometimes as i dun noe who to turn to when i need to say it out.I think i am so usless as i only knows how to cry and dun dare to talk to her.I am very scared,very very scared.Becos i once lost all my frens and now i dun wish to happen.I did everything to prevent it from happening like, i tolerate the way she treat me and i try to give in to her.But this is the way she treat me back.Change topic,i am going to cry soon.Hehee...  Had been sick for like 4/5 days.All becos of the fried tofu i had for every 3 meals.I also dun wish to eat tofu just that my dad wants the whole family to be strict vegan for 2 weeks.I am going to die hahahaha... My sister kept telling me that she every night dreamt of eating a big feast.Stop here!!
