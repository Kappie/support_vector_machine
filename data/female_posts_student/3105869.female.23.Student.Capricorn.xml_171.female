I walked into my room tonight and the guy who was flirting with me was standing in the center kissing another girl....in MY BEDROOM....we normally leave it open around this time so we can go to and from our respective rooms and hang out or watch CNN in the rooms where there are coveted tvs.  But no, this was messed up.  Then he acted like nothing was wrong, and I was like hello, go now, and apaprently he is the guy-who-has-never-been-rejected...there's first for everything, huh? No more dating -R-
