Hmm...is this a bad thing?  i can think of situations where looking guilty would be bad, but maybe the fact that i know i can't hide my guilt will hinder me from doing things that i don't want to be caught at.  I think thats why up until lately I've always been comfortable in the little box my parents worked to create for me.  i knew that I if I broke the rules I would get caught and didn't want to lead to my own demise.  Now part of me wants to get away with things, but I still know I won't.  My box seems to be shrinking rapidly and hte once comfortable boundaries are closing in on me.  Hmm...better start working on that face.
