STRIKING. GORGEOUS.  so we stared at them for a while, then went outside and had fun with side walk chalk (needless to say, the lawn boys weren't impressed) then btang DROVE ALL BY HERSELF to steph's and we washed our cars (which we discovered are christmas colors...we have big plans.) after the best waterfight in history, i had to leave and help out at a garage sale (AGAIN) but then i left...and picked up kate and we decided to go to lake phalen.  BUT on the way, we saw paul driving the opposite direction, so we called him, found him, and he invited us (emo, kate, me, simone, hannah) to his house to go swimming/have pizza/watch jurassic park 2...yeah, AWESOME.  then i drove hannah, kate and i to hannah's (at around 30 mph the entire way cuz of all the dayum deer).  and we did the usual. ate, talked, ate, voodoo-ed, ate, slept...the next morning, kate and and i headed to simone's (hannah had a painting class) and met up with becca and steph.  after tanning with jack (PANAMA jack), swimming, and of course eating, we decided to bike to whitebear beach for a quick dip at the public beach (ahem...looking for hot boys).  then somehow, not sure how, we ended up at becca's house and then on tom's boat! which was sooooo much fun it's crazy! after another swim, this time in freezing bald eagle lake, and after docking the boat (what a feat.) we went to tom's for a second where a few of us borrowed shirts (haha and smelled like boy for a bit).  then to cup and cone, where i unfortunately had to depart (without even ice cream!) cuz i had to be home in 10 minutes and i like at least 25 minutes away.    wow. that is supppper long and i'm sure i left out a bunch of stuff, but if you read all that, a) i apologize for boring you, and b) shame on you, you should be out and about enjoying summer! yeah, so that entry is basically a proclaimation of mine just to state the complete and total fabulous-ness that is summer vacation!
