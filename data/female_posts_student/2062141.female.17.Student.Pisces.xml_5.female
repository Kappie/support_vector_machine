Cause it'll be super ultra fun! Lol I didn't even go to the meeting (I couldn't find it!!) so I'm not entirely sure what it is I'm going to... hehe. I wasn't even gonna fill one out (why the hell would I be picked?) but Ms Fox said I might as well.. and I got it! Awww Charlotte I wish you had filled one out!!! Oh well. I love you...! I never get Natalie/Josh time anyway. 'Cept for you know that Josh will ditch me. Oh well. It'll still be fun! I'm so glad tomorrow's Friday, this weekend I'm finally doing something with Amanda, Rachael, and Kerri (I say finally because it seems like we never do anything anymore)... we're gonna go see Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Yeah I know what you're thinking, NATALIE's seeing a HORROR movie??? See, blood and gore isn't so scary to me. It's stuff like freaky supernatural stuff that really gets me. Slasher movies are just fun, because everyone is so on edge to see what's gonna happen when she turns that corner. I should scream right at the part.. it'd be funny. (Hey it works on me....). I'm so in a better mood today. That Link Crew thing really made my day. So yeah we get to miss school all day. Most of the day. (I just said 'day' like a million times). Yeah. Hooray! And to add to that, tv is new tonight. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT IN LIFE.   Believe me, I could think of lots of things. But you know what, right at this very moment it's all okay.
