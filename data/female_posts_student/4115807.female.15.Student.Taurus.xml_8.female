OMg last night around 3-4 am i heard this loud BOOM! and then all the electricity went out, including the air conditioning.. so there i was dieing of heat while my dad tried to figure out what happened he said something about a generator or whatever. it knocked the whole block out. then i couldnt go to sleep cuz we lit candles and im deathly afraid of fire so i had to wait till 5:10 ish when the sun rised to go to sleep so i could blow out the candles them i had to wake up at 8!! and i didnt leave the house untill 11 but anywasy hmm well here is my schedule...
