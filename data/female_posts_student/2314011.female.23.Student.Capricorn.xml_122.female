Only to find my comments erased, along with my fancy links, and my text in a new, uncaring, unfamiliar environment.  I hated it.  So, I made my peace with the wonderful comments, lost forever, and set out to make things right by dedicating this (new) blog's life to returning things back to the way they were.  Added the links again, matched the background and text colors as best I could, and finally came to the comments.  They came right back after a few copy and pastings.  YAY!!  They weren't lost or forgotten!    Now that I know those are easily recoverable and have a better working knowledge of the color situation, I might attempt another template change one day.  But it is not this day...
