Same kind of thing that happened the monday before last, only worse.   Had guitar this afternoon. My leads sound fabulous. Mr. Beach calls it improvision, to me it's more like rolling a ball really hard inside a fence and letting it ping the sides of the barrier. I'm 99.9% positive that didn't make sense to anyone but me.  I will maybe get on here later and explain some stuff... If not if will have to wait until lunch time tommorow.  I love being wanted.
