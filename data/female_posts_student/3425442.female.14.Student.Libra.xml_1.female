I came out in my friends quincenera thingy and my partner supposebly likes me. My friend told a white lie. Well this is what she told of how it went. She saw him a couple of weeks ago like last last week ^^ and she said " oh you know how ya been and do you miss your partner" and he said " why! Did she say something" and my friend said that just to see what he would say she said " Well she's been asking about you and she does kinda miss you" and he said " I didn't want to say anything but I do miss her" and she was suprised ^_^; >. . hehehe Bye ^_^ I'll come back with more news of my life...^^
