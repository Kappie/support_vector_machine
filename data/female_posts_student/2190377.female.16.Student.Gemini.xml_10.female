Thursday didn't suck too hard, Halloween was cool, Texas Chainsaw Massacre made me nearly pee my pants, and having bleach blonde crazy women place a couple dozen electrodes on your head while making small talk about your "long eyelashes" is more than a little disgruntling.  I should be reading 40 pages in my history book, but because I don't actually NEED to read it in order to get an A, I'll compile a list of desired video games games. Can you tell I like lists? I'm not sure why, especially because I'm not organized. at all.    p.s. Barney, my non-horny dog, likes carrots :)  lalala...oh yea  list  (all for ps2)  DDR 2, Karaoke Revolution, Kingdom of Hearts, FFX-2, and whatever the newest Spyro game is  I'm bored. Maybe I should read about the Foundations of Indian Society, 'cause hell, that'll wake me up
