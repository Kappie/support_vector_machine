Actually, I think I entered the stage where you deny everything.. I keep thinking that this girl Mr Right is drawn to already has a boyfried or is not interested for some other reason.. I just hope that I won't have to wait for another 4 months until I get to talk to Mr Right again... yeah, isn't that funny? we've reached the age of global villages and information superhighways but I still can't get a hold of Mr Right..   uh, apart from the usual routine, I did a Hollywood-like stunt today.. yar, well, it wasn't dangerous, but I had to laugh so hard.. my parents have this timer on their shades at the windows and the door to their patio, and so, in the evening we were sitting outside and just at the moment when I wanted to go in, the shades started coming down, and since I didn't know whether my Mom had her key, I ran towards the door and then managed to squeeze in in the last second.. this was so Indiana-Jones-like, I was already laughin before I touched ground inside.. attention dear Academy: here comes your next Oscar winner! :-))  Nighty everyone!
