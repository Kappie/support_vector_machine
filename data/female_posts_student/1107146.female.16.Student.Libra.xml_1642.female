Oh, I always knew I hated FRA, but school in general sucks.  What's the point?  I'm not going to be needing to know how to find the area of a triangle or who signed the Declaration of Independance or how the hell to play "Low Rider" on the vibraphone.  Yeh, it sucks and my teachers are stupid and pile on the homework as if last year never ended.  Yeh, I had 58 math problems to do tonight, plus an essay for English and a "personal timeline" for history.  Boy howdy and thats only 3 classes.    Congrats Liz!!  I wish I had a car...but I don't...yeh...  Hudgins deserves to die.
