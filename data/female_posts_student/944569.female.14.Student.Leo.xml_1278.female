Some people are already pretty much good-looking and I don't see what the point is in "upgrading".  Imperfections are what makes the human beautiful.  The ability to accept imperfections is the best there is.  People who just want plastic surgery for no reason disgust me.  The only people that deserve plastic surgery are the ones that suffer from burns, have been in car crashes or have terrible scars from sickness.  Why is it that everyone wants to be like perfect celebrities?  Holy crap, Michael Jackson is like a plastic scarecrow with no brains for crying out loud.  Do they really want to be like him?  -_- For shame, people.  For shame.
