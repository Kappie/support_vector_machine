My computer will now prompt for my password after the screen saver goes on.  That'll teach them to fuck with my shit when I'm not home.  I'm still non-existant to them and I'm sure they'll find some other way to fuck me over, but at least the comp is safe.  Jesus.  In a manic fit of creativity, I'm working on 3 new songs.  One is called "Wonder Why", the other is called "Don't Wanna", and the third one is yet untitled.  I'm hoping to attain decent recordings of these, for these could be the best I've written (musically, not lyrically) yet.  Other than the above mentioned issues/events, nothing is really going on but work.  And lots of work.  Stay tuned...   ...and keep your pants on.
