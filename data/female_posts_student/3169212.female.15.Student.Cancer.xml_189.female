I should probably read so i can establish who everyone is.   *reading ... stops abruptly when she sees Jack*  Oh no, Jack Sparrow!  Mr. Sparrow i do not apreciate you using me in referance to scare someone away from calling you captain.  I am not a scary person, and if you ever payed an ounce of attention you would see that.  Furthermore, i burnt the Rum to save our lifes.  That includes you!  And just in case you have forgoten, which it looks like you have, Rum is a vile drink that can turn even the most respectable men into complete scoundrals.  I agree with Sarah in that Rum is vile and i believe that the talk of Rum and panhandling of money for it should be illegal in this blog. *breathing heavily*  For the rest of you i bid good day.
