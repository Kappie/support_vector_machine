These shoes are supposed to make the flat concrete more like bumpy natural terrain, which tones your muscles as you walk. Some wearers also claimthat regular use has greatly improved their posture and rid them of back pain. In any case, I would love for these to become the new "It Shoe" since I would never be able to walk in  urlLink Manolos , even if I could afford them.
