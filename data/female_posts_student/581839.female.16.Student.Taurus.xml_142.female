I'm going to san diego on saturday, and i'm excited about that and all, but i had my hopes up once again for the idea that i would get to take my dad's camera. i mean, its one of those oldish ones, where you have to wind up after you take the picture, and my sister already has a camera of her own. one like it, only for modern. so she doesn't like that one apparently any more, and we've only got one short lense. she's of course taking my dad's camera. i don't know, i've been interested in photography for a while, i just never talk to anyone about it. i really like those black and whites, their dramatic like my personality, but i like color too, because its so bright and happy like me. i wanted to actually take some good photos of san diego, and i'll instead get crummy disposable camera ones. this makes me so sad.
