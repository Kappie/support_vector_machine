But I don't think I'm helping him so I'm staying out of his life for a while;  I'll just be the spectator for this event, while Leigh is the opponentish type person maybe, but could possibly sometimes be on his team and while Rosie tries to be the referee.  Josh, the real you, no matter how bad, is better than a fake you.  Sometimes you just have to censor and discipline you real self a bit so it's socially acceptable.  I have to do that quite frequently, and I'm still not always socially acceptable.
