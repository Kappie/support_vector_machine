Anyways, other than doing some laundry, nothing productive happened until like ten o'clock tonight :). If all goes well tomorrow, I will explain to you the result of this productivity ;).     Last song I listened to:   Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head  by Ben Folds Five.   Last album I listened to:   The Best of Bond... James Bond .   Last meal I ate:  Salad, spaghetti with Italian sausage, root beer.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter y el Prisionero de Azkaban . Still no  Spidey . Rar. We'll see about that next week.   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Well, I listened to the Marching Illini today.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I thought about the chemistry behind fireworks and the combustion of propane. Man, that is so lame. :P   Last person I talked to:  Dan or Marjorie.   Favorite song today:   Air  by Ben Folds Five.   Favorite food today:  Black olives.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Made some plans for tomorrow. At least it  should  be interesting.   Funniest thing that happened today:  David slid a CD into his new Mac's drive and jumped back when the machine sucked it in. That was classic. :D
