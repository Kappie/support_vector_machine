I thought this one was much more interesting than the last, there were more intensity and surprises involved. There was a bit of twist too. Although I have not read JK Rowling's book of this movie, still I thought it was entertaining and fun and certainly funny. Forget that big hit movie Troy, other than those BEEFY boys...it was nothing more than male machoness. I do not think the movie is bad, just a very male hormone movie...and also you may learn the incorectness of the history of Greece...hahaha. I've never taken Greek Mythology but I certainly want to. Till then I can't really tell you what was wrong with that portrayal of history of Greece. Except yeah, I agree with Andrew, Orlando Bloom had a sissy part to that movie. Ok for light hearted comedy..go see SHREK! I thought it was absolutely hilarious putting fantasy characters in Hollywood situation. As usual the DONKEY as annoying as can be but without him that SHREK would not have been a movie..and meet the new character of the movie...PUSS.....ready? da da da.....IN BOOTS! Cute cute pussy cat indeed..hahahha.    So yes everyone  HARRY POTTER  ratings out of 10 :  8.5                      Shrek ratings out of 10:  8  for FUNNY!  Let me know what ya all think, ya?
