Took the subway from Barajas, the evil airport from hell, and realized that to get to the damned metro I had to walk about a mile or more, in my daze I had no idea, and finally stairs and hallways later, there it was the entry to the subway.  Of course I didn´t know which line stopped there, but I found out at the next stop, then after changing three lines later I was finally on my way.  Chueca stop, home.  The hostel has been updated but fun as ever.  As I walked into the hostel, literally I met two friends, Emma from Adelaide, Australia, and some guy from Tijuana.  Rock.  I went to the Official Real Madrid store and not only FINALLy got my own real jersey, yes, its Beckham, and I also now own matching undies with the Real Madrid logo on them.  I´m hard core man.  Anyway, so even though I was awake at that point for 52 hrs. I had to keep going.  Remember how I said I wasn´t going to lug an umbrella there I would buy one on the street need be?  WELLLLLLL.....It had been raining here for over a week, lovely cold rainy crap weather, bloody miserable.  SOOOOOO...guess who was on the streey with a white short sleeved t-shirt and nooooo umbrella.   Yeah, very funny.  So Emma and I were far from our hostel after wandering around trying to not fall asleep until we had adjusted to their time, and we had to go into like every single store and finally I asked a scary policeman, ¿Donde puedo comprar paraguas?  I think he was taunting me cause he pointed to a little kids store across the street.  BUT, then....(drumroll)  I realized where we were.....Come on Emma there´s an El Corte Ingles at the end of this street.....So in my little black heels soaked white shirt, we ran, more teetered to the end of the block and into El Corte....Anyway I am now the proud owner of the ugliest umbrella I have ever seen....Oh, and I thought seeing a huge display of every color of Jelly Kellys in the front was a comforting sign.  We played with the Spanish fans and this elderly woman came over and helped us find a good pretty one for cheap.  She taught us what to look for in a fan and how to flip them open like the natives.  We are highly skilled professional fan-people now.  Be afraid.  Anyway so even today my jeans, yes the size 6 ones, are still hanging on my bunk drying out.  Yummy.  Emma has also learned of the miracle of café con leche.  Ahhh.  I miss A., yes mum I miss you too and daddy of course.  Speaking of Daddy, God help me that felt so painfully tragic to walk away from Daddy in the glass divided Houston airport.  Oh felt like my Heart was going to fall out.  He smiled and waved and waited watching until I disappeared.  Daddys are not easy to walk away from.  I was miserable waiting for the two stupid hours until I could board, alone, without my Dad to talk me down from ledges.  I just sat down and stared at the wall after I had walked into a news stand store to get a cosmo, etc. but I made a scene I was crying in public in while I looked at magazines like     , and I was standing there crying as I read them.  I must have looked kinda scary. I love you all, make my brother write me or tell him if he doesn´t I gotta a wedgie with his name on it for August. Te echo de menos.  Vaya con Dios.  etc.
