I hope they give him time off for Bailey's graduation.  I know it would mean the world to Bailey.  My dad unfortunately will not be able to make it to Bailey's graduation...he flies into LAX on the 14th.  I am sad because I know how excited he would have been to have papa there.  Wow, pa is going to be home soon.  We haven't seen papa in a year now.  It has been far too long.  I miss papa.  I mean he is the most critical person in my life, but I know it is for my benefit and he doesn't do it for the mere pleasure...okay, well maybe a little..papa likes to piss me off...he loves pissing all of us off...except maybe my mom because my mom is just the type of person you don't want to piss off...as most of you already know from first hand experience.  I am so blessed with my family.  I am seriously very very lucky to have them in my life.  No matter what choices I have made in my life, whether they fully comprehended them or supported them, they always stuck by me and made it clear to me their thoughts, but supported me even though I didn't take their advice.  I am a stronger person because of them.  I cannot imagine my life without them.  My parents have always believed in me and defended me to my harshest critics.  They also remind me of the things that may slip my mind.  My sisters are always there to support me and my family.  They love the kids as their own...I knwo that the kids drive them nutty a lot of the times, but I know that if anything happened to me and Ed, they would take good care of them.  I know that this all sounds so sappy, but I was th inking that in a few days is my parent's 28th anniversary.  28 years.  I can't imagine.  The best part is they built this beautiful family that despite our fair share of hardships and obstacles has remained stronger and more loving.  I can only hope that one day my family will be as strong as the one my parents made.  I hope I am able to instill in my children what they instilled in me, the importance of family, love and support.  If I can instill this in my children, then I know my children will be better people.  Well I have been pretty chatty today.  So I will end this here.  Take care everyone and until tomorrow...or maybe later.  I am going to go play with Ed and the kids outside.
