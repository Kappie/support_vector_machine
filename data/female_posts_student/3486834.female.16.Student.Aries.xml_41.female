It was a really awesomely awesome movie. Sorry I could not control myself. Now it's 2. I'm about to get ready to go out somewhere.. don't know where yet. I have a feeling that i will be going to the Galleria next week. I haven't gone in a while anyways. Today is Emily's last day of her camp.. so hopefully we can do something. I think Amanda wanted me to do something with her today, but she hasn't called.. I wish I didn't lose everyone's number.. Cause then I wouldn't be bored. My mind just blanked out and I can't think of anything else to say. Bye all you sexy people out there!!
