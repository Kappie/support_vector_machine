It is an amazing feeling to actually be doing chemistry homework and  know  what I'm doing, or know what kind of answer I am looking for.  It all just clicked in my head.  Sitting through French is not so bad, I have Joe with me, and we have quite a laugh together.  I've been going to lunch with friends lately, and I don't feel so alone.  Speaking of which I am going to lunch with Amber tomorrow which I am quite excited for.  After lunch comes a long period of math, but for entertainment my friends and I pass notes back and forth with drawings of silly interperative dancers on them and make dumb but humorous Valentines for each other(I really don't think you should ask...).  Then peace came.  It was excellent.  I had quite a fun time, it was only rehearsal...and I'm not in the upcoming performance seeing that I'm a new member, but it was funny and I actually had a conversation *gasp!* What was that? A conversation?!  Yes that's what I said, I engaged in human interaction.  I think I'd like to congratulate myself and give me a pat on the back.  I've decided to try and not be the loser that I've become and come out of the shell that I've created for myself.  Taking babysteps of course, and trying not to edit every single thought until I've decided not to speak at all.  I feel really inspired at the moment, and I am only hoping I can hold on to this feeling for more than rest of tonight.
