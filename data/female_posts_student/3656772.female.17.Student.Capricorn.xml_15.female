"I'm going to manufacture an injection that shoves joy up your pathetic, melancholy ass until you're so fucking happy you levitate."  LOL, I had a dream and my nonexistant twin said that to me. I think my subconcious is trying to tell me something. I'm sorta depressed, but not really. I just get moody and write to get it out of me. I don't really brood like this in normal life. *sighs* so anyways....I need softer hemp for my necklaces, this kind is too rough...it makes my neck all red.      Hmmm....ran out of things that aren't depressing to talk about. Lol. So I'll just end here to try to get a few less pathetic entries.
