He attempted first to join the men's only Hero's of the Universe club, but they told him that his name sounded too much like erotica man, and he left hanging his head.  Next he approached the slightly less conventional heroines of Society club, but they took offense at the man in his title and chased him away with feminist banners and glares of laser death.  He then came to a small bar that was said to allow heroes of all kinds called the Salty Myth (it was down by the dock, which Aquatica liked very much any way).  The Salty Myth stank of dried fish and dirty spandex, but it had a nice community of drunken super people that liked to tell stories and discuss religion.   Everything would have continued just fine for Aquatica Man, if it hadn't been for his arch enemy, Flame Father.  Flame Father had it out for Aquatica since they were in day care together.  Aquatica would always walk by small fires that Flame Father (then Flame Son) was starting and inadvertently put them out.  Aquatica didn't have much control over his powers, then or during the time of our story.  His main power was to exude humidity, but he could occationally create rain, and once, during a fierce battle with an evil squid that was terrorizing a picturesque Irish fishing town, he was able to suck the entire bay of water into his very moist aqua socks and hold it there until the hapless squid died.  This last feat, however, had never repeated itself.  Aquatica Man attributed his power to a pair of mythical water socks he had acquired from his grandfather, and wore his blue and black flexible foot ware everywhere he went.  Often when Flame Son would find a small corner in which to stare at a stick or bundle of grass until it ignited, he would wait with anticipation as it grew, and then suddenly sputtered out.  Always, he would turn around to find Aquatica Boy behind him, watching with curiosity.  Not only did Flame Son developed a complex around this, he also became a raging alcoholic. Having tracked Aquatica Man for many years, Flame Father saw his chance one night when Aquatica Man stumbled from the bar arm and arm with Chiseled Features Gurl.  Flame Father waited till everyone had gone home and then lit the bar aflame with his magic vision, sure that Aquatica Man was distracted.  When Aquatica Man heard of the disastrous fire he knew who was to blame.  He of course wanted revenge, and he also knew that Flame Father would be celebrating until late at the Bad Guy's Den.  However, because of an off chain of events and a foot fetish of Gurl, Aquatica Man had left his precious zapatos under the table at the bar.  Now he was helpless.  He felt fairly dry, but that could be the extreme hangover of the night before.  He walked to the bar to admit defeat to Flame Father, and maybe punch him once, just to get his disappointment out of his system.   Aquatica Man entered the bar to glares and anger, glanced around and not seeing Flame Father quickly exited the run down slum.  He then made his way over to Flame Fathers apartment, which was on the fourth floor of an abandoned industrial complex.  The sky was dark, and Aquatica Man walked carefully with bare feet through broken glass and old rotting wood.  He knocked and heard the door open.  Flame Father was in a well lit room packing up his assortment of belongings.   "Hello Aquatica, nice to see you here." "I have come to tell you that I am beaten."  Aquatica noticed that Flame was clean shaven, and looking spry and young, very different from their other meetings. "Come and sit and have a cup of coffee with me." They sat at a box coffee table and sipped piping hot coffee for a few minutes, then Flame cleared his throat and said, "I really need to apologize Aquatica.  So I have been going to AA for a while, and last night was the first time I drank in about three months.  I went way over board, and fell into old habits of stalking you and such.  Really though, I think what happened was for the best.  Starting a fire and not having you put it out really cleared up my neurosis, and made me realize how silly I've been.  Also, burning down a bar forced me to detach myself from a source of alcohol in an extreme way.  Thank you." "No," relpied a teary eyed Aquatica, "Thank you.  I was sinking all of the money I earned saving that village into that bar, now I can start anew.  I am just sad that I lost my socks, I feel a little lost with out any super powers." "Oh, speaking of, in my drunken craziness I picked these up. "  Flame Father held up a pair of slightly scorched blue and black aqua socks, that were dripping a little.  "I picked them up to gloat over, but this morning I just felt bad.  I think that I am going to try to become a super hero, instead of a super villain.  You can have these back.  I was thinking of going somewhere dry and sandy and constructing housing out of sand turned into glass.  You know, if you wanted to come, I bet that anywhere there's sand the people need water."   So Flame Father and Aquatica Man became partners, and learned to work as a splendid team.  They had many adventures... But that's another story.
