I am at my brothers at the moment.  His fiancee and I went to this huge craft store - almost rivalled the candian ones - but not quite! to choose card and stuff for making wedding invitations.  I also got some bits and bobs. Tried to get a puncher but they didn't have any stars or shapes I wanted.  I did get some embroidary thread for another project I am working on but it is TOP-SECRET so can't tell you anything about it yet.  Well this week has been a bit of a blurr.  Had 2 assignments to hand in which I managed, my last lectures for the term, my job interview/briefing thing, a chuch social action meeting and of course last night was the last ever episode of Friends.  Lizzy came round, and my flatmates and some others all piled in Lisa's room to watch it but actually I wasn't THAT impressed - thought it was a bit predictable.  And like you wouldn't know you were having twins!    Job went really well. Start next week doing about 25 hours a week. I can work anytime between 8am and 8pm.  I think the work will be interesting - get to read about some well wacky patients - makes me and others seem quite normal. But it is going to seriously challenge my lack of introversion as I will be working in this little cupboard with no windows and just me on my own! AAAhhhhhhh. As you can probably tell unlike Melanie I do not have an innate desire to be a  hermit. Infact I HATE my own company.  Think I will take a radio or something - hey maybe I could listen to Vinyl Cafe all day. And they even said that if everything goes ok over the summer they would like to offer me the opportunity to carry on in September just doing 10 hours a week or however many I want AND they will increase my pay! This is like my first proper job.  All my other jobs have been looking after kids and stuff which doesn't really feel like a proper job. I have to wear smart clothes too!  the social action meeting was really encouraging. I was totally intimidated because I was the only young person - the other couple who were vaguley young were late 20s, they had all been at church for years, and were all super-holy folk.  But it went well and I felt able to say stuff, and it was so inspiring to hear other people fighting against injustices and having a heart for this sort of thing = made me feel like I'm not a complete nutter or totally alone banging away at the Great Wall of China with a plastic toy hammer.  Well thats if for now folks.  hope you are all doing ok. xx
