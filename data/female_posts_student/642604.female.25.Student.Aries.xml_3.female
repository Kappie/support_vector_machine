     
      So I accidentally put up my Snow Day away message and a friend out in California just IMed me to ask how it was possible we were having snow?  I had to explain that I had put up that one by mistake and that it was right next to my I'm out message... but by the time I got the message she had already called her mom to ask her how she was enjoying the snow... I make havok even when I don't mean to...
