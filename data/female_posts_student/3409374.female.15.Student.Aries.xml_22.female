Then i felt like shouting it out loud...guess who? It's Y.O.U!!! But anyway...i didnt.  But as the conversation progressed further, i realized he only treats me as a sis...and that he likes this super-chio gal in his tuition....Sigh...told u it would never work. Then after tt i told him tt i used to like him [i still do though, but lesser] and asked him if he got the slightest hint...well, he knew lar of course...cos i so obvious one...LOL  So, u could consider tt is confession night [like 25 June] cum breakup night. Looks like i can't like him anymore cos there's really no hope liao lor...So now i officially single. S-I-N-G-L-E. aLONE. It's so different not liking anyone...somehow, the burden's gone but u feel...how should i say it...u feel as if u're like missing something...HaiZ  Weird feelings i haf...and i can't do anything about it...  "Life's kinda messed up right now...every corner seems to be another maze..."
