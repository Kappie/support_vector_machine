I dunno, It was like oh man, I'm an outsider! No one likes me!   Indeed that wasn't true, i mean, they don't even know me and i was there to see my friends, but whatever, a Robson thing i guess. It was really fun actually! I saw sooooo many new things! I saw all my friends and went into a diferent high school for my first time ever!!! Wow, that really was fun...The best part was going to Bio. Oh yes, you gotta love Bio, even though i've never taken it. I must say, Magee is still more cooler, not to start a controversy, but it's just so new and it's in da creme du la creme area! Anywho, if I wasn't so tired I probably would have had a much better time. My 2 disapointments, being extremly tired,and not seeing Brendan!!! Where was he!!!?!??!?!?!?! oh man, that was a disapointment indeed.  Ahhh McRoberts, what a nice school. You gotta love it, except for that freaky french vibe! And they fact there were video cameras...Ah yes, freaky video cameras and weird french vibes makes McRoberts my personal favourite school! No wounder, t's got some of my best and closests friends that I've ever had. Ahhhhhhh, that's what makes it so good...
