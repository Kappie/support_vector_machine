I would love some good shrimp e'touffe right about now.  And we're not talking the Central Illinois stuff-what I wouldn't give to be down in N'Awlins right about now.  Maybe for next year...until then, I've figured out what I'm giving up for Lent.    Bye Bye Chocolate...Hello Smaller Jeans!   Ta da! I am giving up... Chocolate!!!- I'm on the South Beach diet anyway, I have been for a week (although this weekend was a massive failure-I had Timpone's AND pizza AND liquor! Oh well, I'm back on track) but eliminating this won't hurt, seeing as it is my #1 guilty pleasure, now that SATC is over.  Arg. The goal is to have lost 20 lbs. by the end of Lent, and judging from the diet's predictions, I don't think this is so unreasonable, as I have lost between 5 and 7 already.  The total weight loss goal is 50 lbs., in hopes of getting CLOSE to my high school weight again. That may sound like a lot, but seriously, I was less than that once, I can make it.  If I wanted to totally kill myself, I'd try to get down to my actual high school weight, but in order to do that, I have a feeling I'd have to start up the three mile runs again, and there is NO WAY that is going to happen-back during freshman/sophomore year (@ CHS), I was running at least 15 miles a week. No wonder I was slim. It's hard to believe I was that little at one time.  And strangely enough, I never thought I was little then.  Funny how your perception changes w/ time!
