I told Mr Wilson that i just couldn't do it but he kept pushing me and i almost cried (again) but i held it in, i'm sure he could see this but all he did was say that if i didn't agree to do it he was going to call my parents and make them make me do it, but i heldthe tears in. After school, my mum was there to pick me up and the tears i had been holding in just ran down my cheek. I told her about having to do my speech again, and since she could see i was upset, she said that it didn't matter if Mr Wilson was going to call, she would just tell him that I have always had problems with speeches and she couldn't make me do it, if i didn't want to..... The worst week of my life  3 out of 3 days i've cried 2 out of 3 days i've let people see it 3 out of 3 days i've been depressed 1 out of 3 days i took Laura's "don't worry you'll die one day" speech seriously and smiled at the thought  i hate feeling this way  Rhedyn "Nevermore"
