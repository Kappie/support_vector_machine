Another good thing: I was freaking out about getting all of my reading done tonight at the library, because the book I need is on reserve, but if you check a book out at night, it isn't due back until the morning... so I ought to get reading now instead of fucking with my blog. Also, now I need to get to the library by nine, but that shouldn't be too hard if I'm devoted. Now you can tell me what you think, although I'm sure no more than 3 people read this. Hee.
