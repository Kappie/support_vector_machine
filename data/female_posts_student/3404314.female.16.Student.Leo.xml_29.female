Far more frequently you're wearing perfume, with you say, "No special place to go" But when I ask will you be coming back soon, you don't know, never know.  Well, I'm a man of many wishes, I hope my premonition misses, but what I really feel, my eyes won't let me hide, cause they always start to cry. cause it's time could mean goodbye.  Lately I've been staring in the mirror, very slowly picking me apart. Tryin' to tell myself I have no reason, with your heart. Just the other night while you were sleeping, I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name. But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping, you just say, nothing's changed.  i really like this song!! katrina introduced this song to me.. when we were at manila pavillion!!! these past few days.. this song has been lurking in my mind... it just cant get out!! this song is by stevie wonder....
