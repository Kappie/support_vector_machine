I have very fresh breath now, though, and I thank you and your mints for that.  I'm sorry about your mother, Insha. These are trying times for us teenagers and our bitchy parents. The week will go by quickly without your car (hey, my parents still haven't given the door to my room back, so I have to do the hand-wavy-over-chest move more often), and your parents will apologize for being too harsh on you. Just think ahead: a year and a half before you can say goodbye and whiz off to college. I think we can tolerate it for just a bit longer...as long as we're drunk half the time or something.  In other news. Hey looky-looky!: They updated the  urlLink TPHS Music Website . Lots of pictures of us playing, too. Ahhhh I'm really excited for the Six Flags Trip, so I'm going to compile a list of goals for the trip:   1) Climb the hotel roof again 2) Swim in the hotel pool 3) Meet a drunk middle aged man again, talk to him about gambling 4) Sneak in ******* 5) Buy more Mexican sweet bread and candy at a random Food -4- Less 6) Prank call ***** 7) Sneak out at night, play T or D 8) Ride X and Scream 9) Avoid Stink Boy 10) Avoid freshman bus, ride in cool people bus   Any suggestions to add to the list??
