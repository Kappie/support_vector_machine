It promotes being out in the sun, light pastel happy colors, and fuzzy things like bunnies. Its like Easter kicks winter in the ass, and part of my depression. Atleast for awhile :)   weeeeeeeeeeee!.!.!  Well...the good part of easter is about to wind down, and now the bad part is about to begin. My dads "girlfriend" is coming over soon...as well as her teenage daughters. I think I'd rather puke then have to suffer that uncomfortableness. And my dads "girlfriend" dresses way cute, meaning her kids are going to dress way cute and I'm going to be trash. WOO! . I love when that happens. I'm leaving asap though...dinner starts at 5 and I'm going to say that i'm expected at genies at 5:30( which, technically, isn't a lie, because i told genie I'd be at her house around 5:30... :P ) rarrr! tonight...later tonight...is going to suck to. I need to clean my room and do massive amounts of forgotten homework.   I shouldn't have eaten so much candy. Its getting down to diet crunch time....I only have two weeks until prom. OKay.... so every diet starts tommorow i guess....
