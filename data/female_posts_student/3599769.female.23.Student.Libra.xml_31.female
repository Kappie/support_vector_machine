I still cannot believe that I feel this way, that I am weak enough for someone to trigger all this. Our breakup, in almost every true sense is like a divorce. Except I don't get to see my munchkins. Or my house.   Yesterday he said, "In my mind you represent everything that I want, stability." Thanks alot fucko, I can clearly remember about 3 yrs ago when he asked me what I was looking for, that was my exact answer. See thats why I didn't ever think I'd be in this situation~we were looking for the same thing. And then he had to go and fuck it all up.  I asked him when was the defining moment (if any) when he wasn't in love with me anyore. He said there isn't one. So I asked well then why did you fall out of love with me?  His reply was "i'm stupid, and I don't know what I'm doing."  Once again, thanks alot fucko.  Someone just please come and take this pain all away. I'm so tired of hurting.
