Like a glowing light, Flickering in a lamp, Suddenly extinguished.  Like a star being born, Than a fast explosion, And it dies.  Like getting a wild buzz, Hiding in the clouds, Dreaming a luring dream.  Like rain splashing in puddles, slithering in anger, Stealing a metal-iron obsession.  Like everything that begins, Something has got to end.
