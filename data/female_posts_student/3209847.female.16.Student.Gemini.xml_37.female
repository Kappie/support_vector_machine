I miss her so much when I'm away from her. After that i went to Hibachi with my family. I stuffed myself, and I missed sarah, but I had some fun. Then I got home and talked to sarah for a bit. She had to go fix her computer because spyware is taking over..  So, I, the hopeless romantic desperately waiting to get away from this place, started looking up Chicago apartments under or at $600. I found a few that looked really good. I hope I can live in Chicago with Sarah some day. I want to go to college somewhere in illinois so that i can visit Sarah at Northwestern. I know I couldn't get in there, but maybe somewhere a little less "Educated" and "Hard to get into"  Now, Sarah and I are talking on the phone. Then, i'm going to go to bed. I'm already pretty tired. Good night everyone. Have a good wednesday tomorrow. *hug* to sarah  bye
