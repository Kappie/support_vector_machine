Ok well today.. we hung out, OMFG- we went to a thrift store with her sis. By the way her sister Laura got a '92 Volvo, it was soo hot. Ok anyways.. at the thrift store Emily got this really cute boy's shirt that says '....Tots... Gymnastics' or something like that. It was only 49 cents!! lol. I got this boy's NBA shirt and a white belt. It only cost me $3! hah! So that was an experience. Then we went swimming...! fun! So yeah now we are just being weird as usual. Well it is mostly Emily being weird. She made up a new word. ***LIZNOVE!!*** umm yeah it's a pimp word for love. Tomorrow we are gunna hang out until we start getting on ea/other's nerves.. haha.
