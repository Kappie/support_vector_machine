K, I wasn't asking about the dream; if I was, I'd've described it. I was asking if you had any suggestions to dull the pain, something other than time and ibuprofin, which are only so effective. (And don't tell me antacids, either; I've tried. They work less than the ibuprofin.)      I bet knives will go through you when thrown from a distance when they have gravity working on their side.                   -the Sorceress of Stories and Scifi         "Dogs are my favorite people." -Colonel Jack O'Neill, Stargate SG-1           		  Do you Yahoo!?
