I wrote "precise edges" on a random sheet of paper and I've forgotten why. I'm hungry, but the scales tell me I should skip random rummaging for food. What is this, anyways? I've never really cared what I ate. Hah, it showed. And now it's coming back at me. The only thing different  now is that going off campus actually encourages me to eat. Add on study hours (prolonged only by constant munching) and I probably should deliberately deprive myself of something just to make up for it. Dieting must be like sleeping. You satisfy your desires until you know you have to stop, but then it's unbearable.  Just came back from a piano lesson. I can play the Bach while Mr. Francis is in the other room, but once things get settled down proper I can't concentrate. Oddly enough, I'm not all too terrified for this Saturday. I just know it's going to be another nervous session, and performance will be heavily dependent on how I can control those nerves. So I tell myself I just have to consistently play at it this week. Maybe I'm so unfazed by regionals because of SATII tests. I need to study history, I haven't finished. Bio AP is officially two weeks from today, and I REALLY need to catch up on that one.  Argh. [rubs eyes]  Drive test: May 24, 3:20pm. Being the dork I am, I'm reluctant to miss school. And after I take the test, my first independent trip will be to Mr. Francis's house. Lovely.  Studying.
