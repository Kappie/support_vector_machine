"i was, until u came up to me and asked me that stupid question", i said to myself. that and the stares i got from the other diners.  call me paranoid, or something else..but i think people nowadays are geting more and more clique-y and dependent. i think its about time people try to enjoy the company of their own selves..its not being a loner and detaching yourself from others.. but, i think, people will come up with better things to say, suggest more happening hang outs,or better yet be more effective people who lead fun lives if they can be able to be with themselves even for just an afternoon.  its like loving. u cant really give something u dont have or did not really get to enjoy.   the bottomline is..its ok eat alone. its ok to be with nobody.... sometimes.   i know.  i have to let it go and loosen up.
