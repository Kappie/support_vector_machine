Jay had a series of unplanned financial obligations that just seemed to string along for months...busted tire: fixed, shady landlord: negotiated; hit and run to his poor car: totaled, but the parents are keeping the money to fix THEIR car.  The parents, who claim to fund Jay through college, also won't pay him back for some medical bills that they ignored and went to collections.  All told, Jay has bounced seven checks, been collected on once, and got a notice from the prosecuting attorney's office for a bad check to McDonald's (oh, the embarrassment) because he never saw a penny of his insurance money.   It never ends, and his bank, a mega-institution dependent upon their buildings of computers rather than common sense and human emotion, are powerless to stop the overdraft fees from piling up day after day.      This weekend started with the same amount of bullshit with which every weekend commences: car trouble and fighting.  It was my car this time--the same busted wheel that we hadn't had time or money to fix for the past four days--and the fighting was over the same tired stuff about how I don't trust his parents and he's offended.  While we were fixing the car, his jack broke and the car almost fell on his leg.  I held the lug nuts and shivered through the first truly March temperatures we've had all month. The Texaco regulars were all lined up against the wall by the payphones, slitted eyes staring through their blue Marlboro smoke as they assessed whether or not we were unlucky, or just incompetent.  Finally, we put on a spare.  I shoved past the smokers, and  called my mom and dad to get the proffered credit card numbers for the tires, and my mom answered with a low, stuffy sounding voice.    "Where's Dad?" I asked, assuming they were still sleeping off their 26-hour bus ride back from the Happiest Place on Earth.  "He can't come to the phone.  They're with Frances."  This was normal; our venerable relic of a cat still had the power to use all of her claws to convince whoever her lap human was at the time to stay put until she was ready to get up. My dad was her favorite lap.  "Can't you bring the phone to him?  This is important." "They're at the vet with Frances.  She has to be put down, and I'm really sorry."    The thing was, my mom really  was  sorry.  Frances transcended the normal pet role in our family for a variety of different reasons.  She and my dad used to have conversations back and forth while she watched TV with him on his days off work.  She used to sleep with her butt on my face at night and only leave whenever she knew I was all the way asleep.  Frances was everyone's best friend, and she ended her life suffocating to death on her favorite chair while everyone else was out of town.  My dad said her joints had already stiffened when they found her.  I came to Jay with red eyes and the hiccups--a sure sign I was about to lose it.  He bundled me in his car, and I spent the rest of the afternoon on my couch watching the sky turn overcast and the freezing rain fall on the plants I had bought for the balcony in a fit of springtime hopefulness.  When I finally got up, four hours later, I found an e-mail from my Dad.   He's managed to connect the symptoms from Frances' death with his dad's;  they both had a form of emphysema and basically asphyxiated to death.  He told me he feels like a murderer for putting her down, which is normal except he thinks he murdered his dad and my little brother, too.  I didn't know he was the one to turn off life support for my grandpa and Alex, and I don't know if my family knows either, but I guess my dad can't stop blaming himself for all this death.  I used to joke that the only time I ever saw my dad cry was when we buried an animal, but it's obviously more than  that.  He begged me not to tell anyone else.  No one is close to my dad like me, but knowing that he thinks he killed our family is too much for one person to know.  I can't breathe I'm so worried for him, but what's a poor, starving, maligned college student supposed to do when her dad's three hours away and a mountain of bills, professors, and broken vehicles is determined to keep them apart?  I guess what I want to know is when is this shit going to stop, and how am I going to make it until then?
