(to pass the time, i listened to my cd player, played 'word seeks', ate food...yeah that's about it. oh, and watched a movie. by the way, has anyone ever heard of the movie 'the station agent'? because seriously...what the hell. worst movie ever. and why would they show that on the plane? i'm sure no one's heard of it...ok so this is me stopping blabbing.) got to london-heathrow airport (that's in london, england) at around 9:30 (their time...so around 4:30 our time). took us about half an hour to get through customs and shiznit, then we got picked up by my aunt. she took us to her house, where we had snacks (yes. at around 10:30...we were having snacks. sweet.), then i went to bed.    tuesday : woke up semi-early. actually, got woken up. by my one year old cousin, matthew. (i love him.) showered, got dressed, then we went to the butterfly house thing...which, aside from having (yes, you guessed it)  butterflies , it had amphibians and reptiles and birds and monkeys and elephants. (well...not elephants. but i wish.) then we had lunch in a little cafe (prepared sandwiches...gonna miss those), and then had an ice cream. then we went to my aunt's house. (i think...it happened so long ago. frik i'm gonna forget half of the stuff i did.) then the usual thing. (i.e. supper, chatting, sleeping.)    wednesday : best day of my  life . minus the part when it kindof sucked...but i shall get to that later. my aunt (who i am now going to refer to as sue) took us to   legoland  ! aaaah. i was so excited...but then, since i was still kindof jet-lagged/tired, i didn't have much fun...and i must admit, i was a grumpykins. (note to self: never use that word again.) but legoland itself was pretty sweet...there were rides and food and...lego...there was a huge display of things made of lego, like buckingham palace, and cities from around the world. it was awesome. i went on a mini rollar coaster, a spinny thing, a spinny water thing...and lots more...i went with my 7 year old cousin. (kindof annoying, but whatev.) so yeah. we had a picnic lunch, then we went back to my aunt's house. (it was massively hot that day...i thought i was going to shoot myself or die before i could acquire a gun. one of the not fun parts.) then i got to go on msn! wow. i was excited...cuz i hadn't been on it for 3 days. ouch. kate with no msn for 3 days...total torture.    thursday : went to a place called kingston to shop! it was sweet...my mum had let me take all of my money out of my bank (about $410) to spend over in england/wales, so i was excited. i got a pair of beige cropped cords...they're sweet. i'm in love with them. and wear them everyday. (yeah...shut up.) i got some earrings too, and 2 belts. t'was coo. then we went to tgi friday's for lunch, where i fell in love (i fell in love a lot over my holiday) with marguiritas (spelling?). i had 2. (non-alcoholic of course. duh.) then we went back to sue's house, and sat around in the garden and i played with matthew.:). i enjoyed it...cuz he's small and cute and...loud.    friday : had a bit of a lie-in. (not really though...due to the fact that matthew is loud/talkative/rowdy when he wakes up.) then my aunt took us to windsor (home of windsor castle...the queen lives there most of the time). i got loads of souvenirs for people, took some pictures, then we went back to sue's house. shortly after arriving at sue's house (at around lunchtime), my other aunt (annie) arrived. she brought seafood with her, which her husband had caught. (he's a fisherman...named ashley. not kidding. he's a cool guy.) but anywho. the whole time that annie was thurr, she barely talked to me. i hadn't seen her for at least 5 years, and she didn't have anything to say to me. (we used to be really close when i was younger.) but whatever. then she stayed over night, and i got introduced to my new favourite show/the latest love of my life. big brother is the show, stuart wilson is the gorgeous man that i fell in love with. (he's only 20...is that rape?) but he was going out with another girl on big brother...but she got voted off the night i watched it. bahahaha. i laughed, while he cried. but don't worry stu, i love you. (p.s. she's a bitch anyway...and she's like 6 years older than him.)    saturday : my uncle and my cousin, sam [14] came to pick me and my mum up, and they drove us to wales. they also brought sam's stepbrother, jed (no relation to me). he's a cool/wierd guy...he talked for like an hour about 'a little mill that wasn't actually little at all'. so me and sam tried to listen to music while jed talked to anyone who would listen. we saw a few car accidents on the way up to wales, including 2 (seperate) cars thathad been completely flipped over and were roof-down. didn't look pretty. so eventually (after about 4 or 5 hours) we got to llanidloes (home of my other cousins...cat(herine) [14] and iain [18]. after about half an hour of being at their house, iain drove me and cat into town (they live in the middle of nowhere) to meet some of cat's friends...who are my friends too. cuz i talk to them on msn a lot...word. anywho. so i saw lucy and joby, and then i met two other guys (i forget their names...sorry), and a guy called martin who, apparently, wanted to 'shag' me. (i.e. have sex with me.) i was kindof scurred...no one wants to 'shag' me over hurr. (maybe that's not such a bad thing...seeing as i wouldn't do it anyway.) so yeah.after hanging out in llani, iain picked us up and took us home. then i semi-ate dinner, and cat's friends arrived for a sleepover/camp out thing in her field. yeah this is who came: lucy, joby, jess, matthew, ben, and josh. t'was sweet...we just sat outside by the fire (they were drinking...but i wasn't) and joby asked me questions about canada and stuff...then at like 12:30, i went inside and slept in a bed. muahaha. but yeah, it was really fun, and they were really nice people so it was sweet.    sunday : we all (two uncles, my aunt, 3 cousins, jed, my mum, and i) went to a lake/dam thing to have a picnic/swim...it was so much fun. jed was in a wet suit, and he was all wet from going in the [freezing] water, and he was sitting on this huge rock, and the way he was sitting on it made him look like gollum. it was awesome. so yeah, iain and sam were jumping from this cliff-type thing into the water...it was fun watching. and i made a movie thing of them jumping...but my mum lost the chip it was on (from the digital camera). anywho. after the lake/dam thing, we drove through borth and got an ice cream/popsicle, then drove home. then we just had like a lazy evening, and my aunt made an amazing dinner...she's awesome.    monday : left llani. :( . iain drove me and cat to aberystwyth so my grandparents' house, and picked up two of his friends on the way. (my mum and sam and jed went in another car with sam's dad)...so we got to my grandparents' house iain and his friends left, we had lunch, and went to the beach in borth. me, sam and cat attempted to go swimming...cuz it was cold and we kindof didn't want to. but when i say kindof didn't want to, i mean sam ran and dived in, while me and cat put our toes in it. then we went back up to where the parentals were sitting, and had a drink...then we went swimming again. and i made the mistake of pissing sam off by kicking water at him, so naturally he had to throw sand in my face. then me and cat ganged up on him, and we had a huge sand fight (in the water)...it was awesome. me and sam really bonded...considering i barely ever see him or talk to him. so then we got an ice cream, and went back to my grandparents' house. then i introduced sam to alexisonfire (he had never heard of them...wow. deprived child) and now he's gonna go buy the cd! wow i rock. so after making him listen to some of my music, he had to go back to llani...so he, jed and his dad left. then we had dinner, and me and cat watched coronation street, east enders, and [heart] big brother.    tuesday : woke up early-ish, and went into downtown aberystwyth with cat and shopped. it was sweet...i'm gonna miss her. i bought a paul frank shirt, a pair of earrings, a pin, and a watch. very successful. then we met up with my mum, and my grandma came to pick us up. then me and cat hung out in the room she was sleeping in and read magazines and talked and were 'sifting through weathered photo albums'. i.e. looking at pictures of when my mum and cat's dad were younger. (they're brother and sister.) it was cute. then i had a shower, and got dressed up to go to the theatre! so much fun. *cough*. we saw 'singin in the rain', and boy, was it entertaining. but there was one good thing about it...i saw a really 'fit' guy (fit=hot). and we made eye-contact. too bad it was actually cat he was making eye contact with. frik. then we went back to my grandparents' house after the show, and me and cat watched big brother. *grins*    wednesday : got up early and packed. then my grandparents drove us down to london, and on the way we dropped cat off in a town near llani where her dad was picking her up. and her dad came with sam, jed and sam's dad, so we got to say goodbye to them again...it was kindof sad. i sortof cried when we were driving away...but i hope i'll see them soon. anywho. then we continued our drive back to london, and it was pretty uneventful apart from the pit stops every now-and-then. yes. then we got to sue's house again, and waited like 5 minutes for her to get home from work. then we just relaxed for the rest of the day, and i played with matthew. *smiles*. then i watched big brother with sue and stuart (her husband/my uncle), and stu (the one i'm in love with on big brother) got voted off! aaah. i almost cried...cuz he's so frikin hot. and there would be no point in me watching it the next night. and wow...just wow.    thursday : tried to have a lie-in, but it was interrupted by matthew waking up and being noisey. we just had a lazy morning, and then sue drove me, my mum, matthew and william to the river thames for a walk. and we looked at boats and stuff, and took pictures. then it started to thunder and rain, so we kindof speed walked back to the car. then we got ice creams, and went to the grocery store where me and my mum bought 'picnic-y things' for the plane ride...like cocktail sausages and stuff. word. then we had a semi-big dinner since it was our last day/night there, and we went to sleep pretty early.    friday : woke up at 5:20 am, and packed and had a shower, etc. then sue drove us to the airport, and we said our goodbyes. then we did a bit of shopping in the airport, and got on our plane. and then we flew, obviously. the in-flight movie was better than the one on the way thurr...it was 'hidalgo', and if i'd have been able to see the screen, then i'm sure i would have enjoyed it more than 'the station agent'. we landed in toronto at around 11:30 am, and went through customs and passport checking and stuff. and originally, we were supposed to be picked up by a redcar (for those of you who don't know what a redcar is, it's kindof like a taxi, but it only takes you to and from the airport and your house or whatever). but as we were walking out of the arrivals thingy, my dad and brother were there to pick us up...so it was a pleasant surprise. and james actually hugged me...you know, like in front of people. wow. then they drove us home, and we gave them their presents and stuff.      "hey kate, how's that popsicle?"-iain   "haha i got it like all over my pants."-me   *looks at my pants*"wow. you really fucked up your trousers, didn't you?"-sam      *as we were meeting one of my grandparents' friends*   "wow, you've grown a lot since i last saw you."-friend, to sam. *whispers to me* "...what? i've never met him before...what is going on..."-sam      frik i suck so bad at these quotes...i should seriously think about writing them down as soon as they happen.    wow. that was my holiday...sweet, eh? i miss it though. it went by so quickly...i hope i go again soon. (i do apologize if any parts of my description of it don't make sense...because i am still slightly jet-lagged.      man, i was so frikin tired yesterday when i got home...went to bed at like 10. woor.      so i don't think i have many more plans for the rest of the summer...minus me and chloe maybe going to toronto for a day, to see the muchmusic vj's and go to the eatons centre and stuff...i hope it works out.      well, i'm out now. (you guys have no idea how long that took me to write.)      i'm scared of cracking up again-   i just want it to be like it was before.      kayte.      p.s. download 'thunderbirds are go' or '3 am' by busted...wow they're cool. despite the fact that they're pop-punk, they have some catchy songs.   ...shut up.      p.p.s. i love stuart from big brother, and i am going to marry him.
