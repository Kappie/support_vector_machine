They say that a fly doesn't eat solid stuff it sucks the moisture out. I am not and will not give examples.  At my house I have become the fly swatter. I spend hours killing flies and get my arm work out. Did you notice that a fly will always land on something fragile when you are trying to kill it. Its like they are thinking Oh land on the china and she wont kill me. I can see it laughing at me and that's not good. I tell the fly not to mess with me and swing softly. Heheh gotcha. I walk away smiling from my new conquest. I am Jody the fly swatter (ok ya its suppose to be funny and taken from the vampire slayer).  I mostly hate flies when I am eating. A fly lands on your porkchop and all you can picture is this fly playing in your cats litterbox and now he is on your food. EEEEEWWWWW!!!! My ex-husband has a cousin that owns a farm. They have pigs and cows and they would invite you to like graduations and you would have to eat outside. I never ate because I was so grossed out. People would be shooshing flies off their plates like it was nothing but how many piles of cow crape did this fly stand on. God the thought makes me want to hurl. My ex would ask me why I wasn't eating and I would say I was waiting for everyone to get done and I wasn't all that hunger. He says this as he bites into a chicken leg that he just chased a fly off of.  I am not talking a few flies at this farm. It was so bad that you had to roll up your windows in your car so it did not fill with flies. I swear your car would look like the room with flies in that movie Amityville horror if you did leave your windows open. Does the visualization  alone do yah in. Little Harry is eating a browning and says he likes them with raisins in it. Guess what that was not a raisin buddy. You do all you can not to hurl all over from the thought. Well tune in next time folks because we will talk about the loved mosquito. HEHE can never tell.
