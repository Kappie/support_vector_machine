I can't wait till I get to see him again, even though I know he won't look the same as last skool year...he never does look the same as the years pass...I mean from 6th grade to 7th grade, he grew his hair out...he was WAY hotter than in 6th grade, I couldn't believe it lol. But then he cut his hair, and made it all ugliful. You see, I like that new style, or old style as you could call it, that's sort of longish and not like plastered to their head. My brother looks so cute when he can grow his hair out, it's just that my parent make him cut it : ( But, you know, he's almost 19 and then will be able to do what he wants. Anyways, I also would like say that if any of my friends find this and regonize it as myself, please don't spread the word...you know who you are "cough cough" Yeah, so bye bye! Gotta go think about the 17 days left ^^
