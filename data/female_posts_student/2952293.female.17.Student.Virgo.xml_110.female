First, I stepped in gum, and it stuck to twigs and rocks and annoyed me. Then we ate some hot dogs, and they were pretty good. We played with a deck of cards, and Elizabeth does NOT know how to play Speed. Instead of just accepting her different way, I threw a fit. It was so childish, but I could just not accept such a terrible way to play. Okay, what do you think? The object of Speed is to put the card higher or lower on top of the already existing card, so you shouldn't be able to put down doubles, right? Like if it was a 4, you can't be able to put down two 5's- that's just crazy, right? Anyways, then we got our faces painted. I got a cat and we all got lightning bolts Harry Potter style. But, my mom said they looked like the Elvis lightning bolt, oh well. When we got back to our table, we saw Chelsea! It was so exciting! We proceeded to hang out with her the rest of the night. I told her about the blink concert, even though I already had. Then we went and played with chalk. Major karma. I wrote a bad word, then got something in my eye. I cursed the song "Proud to be an American" and then noticed that an imprint of a chalk American Flag was branded on my shirt. God was smiting me. Ooops. I dared Erica to flirt with this cop and she did. And by cop, I mean cop/fireman. He was pretty cute. We went to use the nice bathroom, by using my mom's badge. When we were leaving, I saw this cop and told him, "We have a badge, it's cool." He really didn't even care what we were doing. We saw a baby pug, Erica took a picture, and the kid stared at us like we were freaks. The fireworks were WEAK. But it was still fun. On our way home we realized that the cop that pulled over Elizabeth was actually Erica's cousin. Odd, I know. We watched some movies back at mi casa,  Identity  and  Clue , to be exact, then we went to bed.  I was super tired on Saturday. I started the third movie we didn't watch,  Mystic River . Then I went to see  Spider-Man 2 . It was pretty good, but I just don't get into that series. Then I went to dinner. There was a line, so this boy was holding the door. He stopped me, bent down so he was eye level with my chest, and started to read the words on my Used t-shirt allowed. I was looking down and watching him look, and it was so awkward. After he read all the words, he looked up at me, and then rubbed my back. I couldn't even be mean to him, I was that confused. My mom and I went to see  The Lion King , or as my aunt calls it "The Lion Hunter". The show was amazing! The costumes and the scenery- so impressive. Young Simba was really cute.  I babysat this morning. Damn kids. Then we went to the Doo Dah parade. It wasn't very funny. I sat with Megan Donato, whom I haven't seen since I think sophomore year when I taught her maneuverability. We reminisced about when she told me she had five cats (a lie) and sent me to look for them and when we played with my Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls. There was a group of lesbians in the parade with a "Lesbians Against Bad Bush" sign. It was great! THEN... I saw the boy from the Ohio Democratic Headquarters that told me he didn't have any "personal volunteer options". OOOH I love that kid! I think we are destined to be political lovers. He was marching for Kerry, my kind of man.  We went to lunch with Megan and her mom. It was okay. Then my mom and I went to see her friend's photography exhibit. We searched the house for it, but the rooms kept coming, they never stopped. We finally found his work in the last room, the bathroom with a sheet over the toilet, and amongst the other artist's nature shots, my mother's friend shot pictures of a drag queen. But, they were pretty good. He's doing my senior pictures, by the way. Do you want one?  We went to Lowes to check out paint samples. When we were walking back to the car, my mom dropped them and they took off with the wind. I ran around that place trying to recollect them all!  I put together my letters to send to Carrot Top's people about hooking me up for Senior May Program. It took so long! I printed half of them out with "July 4th, 4004" DAMNIT! Then I wanted to mail them, so nothing could happen, and my mom told me to go down to the mailbox near CVS, since that's the fastest pick up. I drove down, listening to BB Mak (hey, it's my mom's car, and that CD is MINE- damn her stealing my Brits!) and Delilah on Sunny 95 (I'm OBSESSED), only to find that the parking lot was just paved and you couldn't go in. Oh well. That's it. Happy Fourth!
