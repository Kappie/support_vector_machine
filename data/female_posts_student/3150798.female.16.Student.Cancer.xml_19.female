When we got to camp, all the staff was in the middle area, square dancing to Rocky Top(haha, very funny). So we got a special Tennessee welcome(and you know, we got teased the rest the week for being Southerners). Anyways, they had the work crew carry our bags for us, which was great for me since I way over-packed.  The camp is gorgeous. Standing in front of our dorm and looking out, there are all the cute log buildings, and then this amazing view of the mountains on every side. The trees were cleared out, so it was nothing but sky and mountains. it was amazing.  And then supper was a huge surprise. Instead of standing in line, as soon as they started playing the music and opened the doors, everyone went into the dining room. And it was a real dining room. Every day, they set the tables with a cloth and often cloth napkins and all that stuff, and they served the food to our tables. It was great. And the coffee was really good. I drank it three times a day. I love coffee.  On the first night, we did an obstacle course in the dark, and I got totally muddy and wet and freezing. It was great. I had mud all over my face, in my hair, everywhere. And the second day, we had a volleyball tournament.I usally hate volleyball, but this was fun. We had the best uniforms, too. Our cabin wore tie-dye t-shirts, bandanna headbands, and we put our hair in pig-tail buns. We were adorable. And we totally should have won for Spirit.  Let's see...I went mountain-luging that afternoon.And I crashed. It was great. I hit the hay-bale and went flying, the luge flipped over me while in the air, and I rolled a bit before jumping up and laughing. The rest of the week I had bruises from mountain-luging. How hard-core is that? The mountain luge guy came racing down the track to see if I was okay. And everyone thought I was hurt or something. I wasn't, but my gosh, I was sore!  On Tuesday, I did the ropes course. I was so terrified, it was hilarious. I had to stop for about three minutes between every part of the course, because I was too shaky to go on. And I said a prayer for every single part. When we got to the part at the end where you have to jump off before they lower you down, I was so freaked out. I had to sit on the edge and slide off. But it was awesome onceI stopped falling, andknewI wassafely attatched to the cable. I still thought I was going to hit a tree a little, I was swinging so hard, but I made it. It was great, I was so glad I did it.  On Wednesday, after a day of wet, muddy horseback riding(on a mountain...with a very obstinate horse named Haley), we had country night. I hadn't been warned about it, but I had some Levi's to wear, and a tan henley top. A friend let me borrow a bandanna for my neck, and I wore pig-tails and eyeliner freckles. We had a country pot-roast meal and a sing-along, then an opera(which was all like, hit songs. It was pretty funny). Then there was a carnival, and we earned tokens to pie our leaders. And then, there was....another thing.  They lined us all up, boy son one side, girls on the other. And I was begging my friend to tell me what was going on, since she had been to camp before. She knew I was nervous and about to run, so she said, "Oh, we're just going to have chips and salsa".  We didn't. We had a square dance. I was so nervous, I couldn't even talk to the partner they put me with. He was cute, too. I talked to him a couple more times that week, whenI wasn't so insecure. I don't know how to dance at all.  It was fun though. I was in a square with both of the other girls from my school, and we all ended up laughing and having a good time. And then we played this game where I ended up slow-dancing with, I think, four cute guys. There was one really tall, tan blonde with great curly hair, and he was singing along to "Hero" by Enrique Iglesias. How cute is that? So the dance wasn't really that bad. Except for during the square dance, whenI realized I had a big cool-whip glob on my toe from the carnival.   On Thursday, we had to hike up a mountain. All I will say about the way up is...I realized how out-of-shape I am. That's all anyone needs to know about that. At the top, it was awesome. You could see everything. We took a lot of pictures, and my square dance partner wanted a picture of us. Of course, I had to get one too. It's going to be framed.  No, I'm kidding about that. I'm not THAT much of a weird stalker-type.  Let's see...I went off the blob three times that afternoon, and I fell off every time. And my whole school groupwas watching. All the guys were cheering and encouraging me, it was SO embarassing. Not cool, but I'm glad I tried.  On Friday, we had a dress-up steak dinner. On Saturday, we had ridge runner go-carts. I had never driven anything but a golf-cart, so I was scared and went really slow. They had to pull me off so the two others could pass me. Only three of us went, because everyone else wanted to pack. And then we went home. I was seriously depressed, it was the most amazingly fun week of my life.  Anyways, besides all that, we had an awesome praise guy named  urlLink Matt Wertz , and a great speaker. I really felt close to God up there, and I'm working to maintain that now. It's just a lot harder at home.
