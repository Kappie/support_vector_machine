It was a solemn day, and I hope everyone can wish her many good things. She'll be alright, wherever she is. She can take care of herself  10:00 am - 3:00 pm Good!! I shopped with my mom, which was actually a lot of fun. We went into Banana Republic. It was the first time that i had ever been in there. I really really like it. I bought a lot of stuff. I got some Birkenstocks, they're very cool. Some guys tried to hit on me in there because i was in a short skirt and probably flashed them once or twice. I really wanted to tell them i was a lesbian, but i basically just played off my young age thing. They sort of backed away after that.  3:00 pm - 11:00 pm  ABSOLUTELY AMAZING . Sarah picked me up from my house and we went to her house. We went SWIMMING for about an hour and a half. I'm sorry, but i had so much fun. I hadn't gone swimming in forever. Plus, with Sarah, its much more fun! haha.  We then ate her mom's famous chili, which is to die for. After that, we went to a movie. we saw Shrek 2. It was sooooo funny. Now i get the "thong" thing everyone is talking about. Now, i'm at home, missing sarah. But tonight was such an incredible night. I wore a new shirt from banana republic tonight, and it looks really cool. I kinda looked pretty for once. Sorry, i'll stop being conceited, okay done. Hehe. I hope everyone tried to have a good day. I certainly did. There's good things out there. I, the luckiest person in the world, have found my good thing. It's you, Sarah.  bye
