So I went to the gym at 6, home by 7, showered, left 15 minutes later, dropped Mom off @ work (we're carpooling these days since I'm bbsitting in Chula Vista) and went to my job.  Four hours, 2 games of tennis, and one Disney movie later, I dropped off Debbie at camp, picked up her sister from summer school, and brought her home.  Then Starbucks and lunch, an audiology appt. up North, back home for a student, then a Jewish Concert in Balboa Park @ 6:15.  As you might imagine, I basically passed out when I got home.  Sleepytime. Today I woke up and filled the car with gas, and I'm @ work right now.  Should be another fun-filled day.  Will update later.
