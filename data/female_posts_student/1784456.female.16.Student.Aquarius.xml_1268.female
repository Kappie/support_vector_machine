Actually... some of it might not have been but I deleted it any way, sorry guys! If any one actually sends me some thing, and I don't know and the subjects weird I usually delete it. Put some thing like 'hey don't delete this it's interesting' and I might actually read it. I got a weird one about a screen saver but hell, my computer's all virused up already and has no more room for more. Ahh gotta go watch Lord of the Rings. Sorry for the ...weirdness but remember, we only live once.
