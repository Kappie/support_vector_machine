I didn't see that I was like that. It wasn't just my quietness/shyness that they see in me. There are also some traits that they can know about me. It made me have a little more confidence in myself. I really wanna know what they think of me more. It makes me feel alot better; alot happier. I really don't know what to say about them coz they aren't really close friends with me. But at least I told some traits I know they have.
