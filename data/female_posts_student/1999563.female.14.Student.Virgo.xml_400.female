It was sorta creeeeeepy. They are glared at me. I guess they can't stand a girl who will always look betetr than them even if she doesn't have make up and is wearing sweats and old flip flops. Or maybe they did look better than myself...I'm just trying to make myself feel better ;)  After we went and got our California pictures developed my dad was like "Do you want a treat?" So I of course said yes even though I knew deep down inside that if I had anymore sugar I would explode (considering I ate candy, soda, and chips all the way to the Washington border)  So we went of in search of fatty-a-licious ice cream (Much so those wanna be skinny girls dismay after they saw me and choclate ice cream mehehehhe) I got a klondike bar. It was pretty good.  As I ate it I found myself wondering about my three favorite questions: why do I exist, why is the sky blue, and how do they make klondike bars.  See, its choclate all around. All the choclate is the same width and there arne't any creases on where is was set to dry. And they put melted choclate on frozed ice cream without the ice cream melting or the choclate freezing to fast. Amazing.  Since I am in the SUPER LONG post mood I shall post about my vacation.   On thursday I woke up at 8.  See, my brother stole my bed because he said it was his turn for the nice area.  So I had to sleept downstairs. Every morning a freako garbage truck would whiz bye going "BEEEEEP" which never ceased to wake me up. (except for the time Mandy spent to night..:-D  )  So I was up. I packed my bags in preperation for the ride home.  At 10:07 we were off to Watsonville. The whole way I just thought of what I would say to this amazing person I was about to greet.  Then we arived.   I said Hi! She said Hi!  And now I have to go to bed.  :)
