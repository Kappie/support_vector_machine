Been on my feet all day .. the ward rounds and teaching sessions included. Hey .. wait a minute there IS one fat paediatrician .. but since im fat myself .. im not allowed to make fat jokes about other people. Its blasphemy.   ward 29 itself is not huge, neither does it have a long corridor. however, it is situated on level 4 ( i think) and to get to the stairs which lead to this ward, one would have to walk the whole length of the main entrance lobby and all the way again along another long corridor. The fact that ward 29 is the sister ward of ward 33 ( the GP bay where kids get admitted after being refered by their GPs) does not help either.Ward 33 is only level 8 and through yet more corridors.   its past 5pm and i am still here in the hospital bcos the kid i am wanting to clerk in has not come in yet, even tho' he was meant to be here half an hour ago. i am soooo tired. I only had like 3 hours sleep last night, and now i feel like i could do with a warm bath and snuggle under my duvet and have a long snooze. Unfortunately, i dont think that will happen just yet. I need to get this paed case history out of the way so i can do it tonite. The reason why i have decided to wait for this particular patient is because he has got Cystic Fibrosis and there is so much u can write about CF.. not to mention the core clinical problems that you can find in a patient with CF.   yeah.. the dundee curriculum, besides governing its student's lives with the abominable book of signatures (the Record of Achievement), is absolutely obsessed with core clinical problems. Example of a typical core clinical problem that you might expect to find in this block - FAILURE TO THRIVE. another example of a ccp ... one ud probably find in general medicine - nausea. If the patient you have just clerked in and examined fully has a problem which is NOT one of the core 108 clinical problems listed in your Year 4 handbook, you can't use that patient for your portfolio. Helllo ... like there are only 108 problems in this bizarre medical world that patients can present with?!!!  ok i am sick and tired talking about medicine. the fact that we have been in 'close proximity' since 2000 .. me and medicine, i have long since decided that its going to be a tough love and hate relationship. So no, medicine is NOT the love of my life. Was.  Speaking of love and relationships, one of my juniors and one of my seniors are getting married next month! To each other, i mean , my jr and the snr. hehehe.. I can still remember the time when i heard about their budding relationship .. and now they are actually getting married! its just too bad that i wont be able to make it to their wedding tho'...hehe.. i know she reads my blog sometimes .. im saving my congrats till after the wedding .. hopefully she will post up pictures of her getting all dolled up for her big day on our dundee community webpage.. yeeee.. best nyer kaween...   best kawin if you know the person u r gonna marry is THE one. goodness me .. golliwog always says there will be THE one for me out there. so does my best friend mazure who says the love of my life is actually in 'hiding' and will show himself when the time is right. d-uh .. whatever bush he is hiding behind is probably rotting away by now and the so-called love of my life has, having seen my recent failed relationships, probably been crapping in his pants not wanting to have anything to do with me.  oh-oh its 530. better go and see if patient is here ...
