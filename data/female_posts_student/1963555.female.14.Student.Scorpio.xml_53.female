So in p.1 aka:French the teacher is so dumb, I know it's mean but I just hate him! so these guys in my class (their like sophmores and juniors) they have some candy corn. As Mr. Clarke (the french teacher, duh!) steps outta the room to talk to another teacher all the guys start chucking candy corn at his seat. So when mr. Clarke comes back in a and sits down, I know it sounds kinda gross but it's really funny, his butt melted the candy corn to his ass! it was so funny! so he stands up to write on the board and there is this little yellow thing hanging off his ass! I could not stop laughing me and Dacia were hysterical. Ohhh man it was great! and then we're like you have somthing on your butt. and he goes oh and starts picking his butt in front of us! lol I'm not sure if it was one of those you had to be there things but it was funny.  well gotta go bye! Q: Why are guys so turned on by boobs???
