I think I will have to study a lot harder the next time. I have a mid-term in psych and a French test on Monday. Wow I have a lot of studying this weekend to do.   My uncle is away for the next 9 days, he went to Toronto. So I have the house to myself which is nice. But it's going to be weird that he will not be there.  I didn't sleep well last night. I had a weird dream. My grand-mother who passed away was in the dream and she was very much alive in this dream. We where in this house that I have never seen before. But it was weird because it felt like home. I think my grand-mother is trying to tell me something but I don't know what. It's all too weird. Anyways I have to get to class. Have a nice day!
