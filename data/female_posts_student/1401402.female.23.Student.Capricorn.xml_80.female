Is it possible that they are actually having sex? They were just there in one spot all clobber to each other. I swore I peek but not eye locked on them. I told the dogs to get a room or at least find a bush. As the neighbors started to laugh at me, I eventually covered my eyes and walked away.    There isn’t any ways that I can separate them while they are going at it huh? They’ll probably attack my ass for trying to stopping them. That is such a shame. Bad dogs. Bad bad bad dogs.   Seeing dogs on the street makes me feel sad and vulnerable to feed them. I too feed one of them with left over food and stuff. However, to see that it became the neighbor slut gets me disappointed.    Come to my conclusion, really is that how dogs have sex? Is that how they get intimate? Can somebody smack me in the back of my head and tell me to get over this. I should stop feeding that damn dog. Its not suppose to become a slut. I should neuter that poor dog. God Damn Dog.
