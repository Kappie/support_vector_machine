In an environmental community, let's say a rotting log, the fungus and animals and bugs are working together differently and perfectly to decompose the wood.  But they have no idea that they are a community because it's us who recognize this by observing them.  So it seems like maybe if we just do what we know best (different talents God has given us) and quit trying so hard, the outside world will be able to observe and define how solid a community we are.
