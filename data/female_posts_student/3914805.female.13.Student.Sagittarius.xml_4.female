Oh what a shallow bitch ..AND he was rich 2!!!! shes a freek. oh well, SORRY ADAM!!!  David slept round last night and we slept in the tent which was kind of fun. we spent all fucking day searching for a sodding tent and then emma wasn't allowed to come! it sucked but we had a good time anyway. even tho i woke up and dave was staring at me nd it made me jump like a frog on stilts! and he prodded me...:@.  Well... just to update you lovly people. Darren dumped me...AGAIN. I agree that it wasn't working 'cause we didn't see each other because he was always at work. but he has a nerve to ask for me back and then do it again 2 say "we can be friends but we shouldn't go out for now, maybe when we both have more time" whatever the fuck that meens, i tried 2 meet him about 6 times but he never showed up once! so it wasn't my fault at all. Well...screw him, my daddy has a hottub now...so he's missing out on some fun oppertunities there!!! mwahaha.  David's sleeping round Dad's tomorrow and we're going to go in the hot tub which should be cool. maybe i can have a hot tub party with Emma Dave and Sara when everyone has time. That would be fucking awsome! I'm going to put some pictures of me and some friends and things i like sometimes soon. so don't hessitate to look at those!!!!!! Over And Out.
