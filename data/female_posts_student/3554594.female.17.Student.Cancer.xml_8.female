Of all the girls I ever met,  your the one I wont love so much.  If I die before you do,  I'll to go heaven and wait for you.  If your not there by judgement day,  I'll know you went the other way.  I'll give the angels back their wings,  and risk the loss of everything.  Just to prove my love is true,  I WILL GO TO HELL JUST TO BE WITH YOU.
