He was being very good about me going to Feas house tomrrow and he told me to have a good time and I said "You say that but you really want me to have a bad time so when I tell you, you can be like 'See you should have spent the day w/ me'" which was TOTALLY out of line. Greg I am so sorry. I love you, please don't be mad at me.
