And I have just discovered I have an infection in my eaar (as in actually inside my ear lobe)- it was really hurting so I was rubbing it, and discovered this big lump inside my ear lobe. Mother says it is not normal, and I htink it is because I am allergic to alot of my earings. I have just thrown most of my earings in the bin. But how my ear hurts- Nicki I totally sympathesise with you.
