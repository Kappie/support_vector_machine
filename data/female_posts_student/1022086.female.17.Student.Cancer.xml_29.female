History was annoying, and in Calculus I took a quiz feeling like poo and continued feeling that way until choir came about. Choir was really good, for a change. We broke into many small groups, and my group was cool. Of course, we did have the best sight readers of the class, but what really fueled it was the fact that everyone in the group actually  wanted  to make music. The group included me, Kim, Misha, Crisha, and Megan (or, the entire audible Alto section), Patrick, Neris, Cassius (who seemed grumpy as usual, though he was the only one, really), Erin, Jessica, and some other sophomores whose names I didn't know, but it was fun. We worked really well together and got a lot done, though we felt as though we'd failed as we slipped out of tune for a measure or two according to B when sight reading some lines for her the first time through. But we got over it.   The good block lifted me up a significant bit, considering that I was really down. Although it may seem that I'm always unhappy, I'm really not. Yesterday was pretty good; excepting an initial overly disastrous incident which happened first thing in the morning that I'd rather not get into recounting right now, some good things happened. We had a good, productive rehearsal in choir, and I got my Honor Choir CD. The recording could have been better, but it could have been worse, too. I also realize that it  is  a recording and is therefore bound not to sound as good as the actual live performance. ^.^ I liked Honor Choir this year.    I found out that I can "ooo" my way through my entire All State audition, which is something I'm very prone to doing (save for a few fragments here and there on which I  need  words to sing it correctly).    Besides all this, I'm one confused camper (imagine that!) more than ever now. I have no clue what I'm doing... I hope I figure things out before I make an even greater mess...  On a side yet more important note, 5-0=4, as I claimed on my last AP Quackulus test... Just as long as CPP doesn't find out and kick me off the math team, I will be all right *giggles*.   All right, well, I'd better get to homework! Laters gaters!    I am exceedingly obsessed with this song:    "Innocence Again" by Switchfoot   Do you remember when You were way back then You held the world inside your hands When you told me love Was the strongest stuff Your strength was innocence  But, oh man The signs of the times are omens You're starting the day in No man's land again   Who are you gonna be? When you're on your knees, who do you believe?  Fear is a lonely man You've been given innocence You've been given innocence again  You should know by now That your darkest hour Is when your broken heart goes down It's a bitter end When the sweet begins Grace is sufficiency  But, oh dear, we'll never deserve it No dear, we never could earn it Now, here the choice is yours  Grace is high and low We'll never be the same  oh, oh, oh... You've been given innocence, innocence, innocence. Who are you gonna be... You've been given innocence.
