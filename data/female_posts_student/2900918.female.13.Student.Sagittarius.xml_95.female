Touched cuz someone likes a simple layout like this and shocked cuz i wasn't really expecting someone to have tagged.   Well, let's see.. I bought "Catalyst" by NFG today, went down to three stores cuz the first two told me it was "out of stock". I figured Simei would be a good location to find it cuz its so deserted and no one really visits there. Got my camera filled up with a roll of film.. I know, I'm pathetic [and broke, btw] but i really can't afford one and mom's not willing to buy me. If I had one, I'll definately post pictures more often. Film's kinda troublesome, you need to wait a few days to get the pics and scan them up to get it online... I'll also like to add that I don't have a scanner.. Hehe.. Ten points more to my "pathetic scale".   Tommorow, however, I'm cruising to parkway to buy a [pirated] Adobe Photoshop disc. How [pirated-ly] pathetic. I really like adding effect to pics, its somehow like the signatures you use in forums. It's abstract and pretty rad I must say.   Once I get it, I'm gonna start editing and put a new bar on the top... Hope I can find it, wish me luck!  _____________________________________________________________________________   Happines and Love from,   ohfreak[dot]blogspot[dot]com   PIC OF THE POST:    Blink in Iraq
