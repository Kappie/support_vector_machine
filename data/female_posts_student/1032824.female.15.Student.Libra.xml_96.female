I feel strangely subdued, I just want to be alone this evening, away from all the noise, the endless complaining and whinning. I want a peaceful christmas, listening to my Christmas songs and tv programmes. I got lotsa' new year resolutions this coming 2004... but before that, I would like to retreat into my tiny shell and not hear a single thing from the world outside.   Wham's "Last Christmas" was playing on my PC just now, reminds me of how crazy I used to be over the 80s. Haha. I love the 80s!!!! Big hair, bright colour clothes, big dangling earrings... and Madonna writhing in "Like A Virgin" video. Pop was good then...
