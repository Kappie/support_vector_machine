(it's the little things that get me)  in other news: last night was fun.  miss lindsey (from my htm lab) had an over abundance amount of money on her meal plan.  thus, she took me and several other people out to fine dinning at the dbh.  being that we all cook there, ourselves, we knew exactly what to get and what it should look like.  the fun didnt stop there....afterward i got them to come out to hokie house w/ me for comedy club.  i even convinced one girl earlier on in the day to skip class and work on her paper, so that she could come out later.  overall, the comedians were not that great....i felt like leaving, but i knew it would all be over soon.  plus i didnt want to go home....everyone was out.  at least lots of people that i knew.  anyway, through conversation lindsey and i discovered that we are both going to be here this summer.  you know what that means...trouble.  we are both bad influences on each other or can be.  one highlight of the night was winning at air hockey....hehe.
