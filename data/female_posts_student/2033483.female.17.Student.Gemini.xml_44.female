Algebra sucked b/c Mrs. Kultz told us we could take our test as a group in our pod.  Well that doesn't help me b/c their all stupid and don't get it.  GEEZ! One tries to do it the other copies off him and gets them all wrong and then another just doesn't do the homework.  Plus, two smell really bad!  This did not please me at all!  Physics was Physics like, as was Lit and Comp.  Lunch was yummy.  I'm beginning to really like those baked potatoes.  Chemistry was fun, I like Jack as a lab partner he makes it more enjoyable.  History was boring! That class is what made me tired.  I missed Renae in Newspaper b/c she had to leave for an appointment that started a half hour after school got out?  I don't get it and I'm sure you don't either.      After school, I got my PSAT results back.  I didn't do as good as others but then again I did better than some too.  I was sorta in the middle.  But then I helped Jessica make up her Physics lab because this one was so fun.  When we came in Chad was in there.  He was speaking in an English accent.  Wow that was funny.  Also seeing him try to do the bending and picking up of the chair part of the lab was hilarious!  Thanks Renae for sticking up for my Blog!  I hate having to censor myself on a place that is supposed to be open for me to express myself!  Night all!
