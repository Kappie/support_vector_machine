I've tripped the past 2 nights on my shoes laying in the middle of the room, argh. Plus I have chem hw, 2 projects due next week for dance and theatre, german hw, and finally an expository essay for english, in which I have no clue in what to write about. Ms. Williams said it could be reflective but has to have sequencing, compare and contrast, anything basically that relates to expository writing. And I was thinking about writing an essay called, Saying Goodbye: How hard it really is. But I don't know, it might be too personal to write about, just because I really don't want to share my feelings with the whole class, certain people I don't mind, but not everyone. I'll write a rough draft and take it from there, I can always change it, it's not due until next Tuesday, I have like 4 days. PARTY TIME THIS WEEKEND!!!! :(   Maybe someday you'll really get to know me not just from letters read to you I pray I get the change to make it up to you We've got a lot of catching up to do
