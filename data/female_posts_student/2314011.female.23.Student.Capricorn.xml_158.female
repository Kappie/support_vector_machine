Supporting Actor, Tim Robbins: well- and long-deserved.  Maybe a nice concession for Mystic River.  Art Direction, LOTR:  good damn start!  Animated Feature, Finding Nemo:  Oooh!  Woo!!  Pick me!  Costume Design, LOTR: YAY!  Better not be a damn concession.  There were costumes in that movie?  Supporting Actress, Renee:  Yay!  Good actress, good role, good win; could her speech have been more rehearsed?  Joe:  "You're writing all this down?  Next thing you know, you'll be keeping a journal!"  Fran Walsh, you ARE the lion, the witch AND the wardrobe!  We love you Bob Hope!  Live Action Short, Two Soldiers:  And what a pair they were!  Animated Short, Harvey (something I didn't get):  Love you Harvey!  And love your hot creator thanking his hot boyfriend.  Visual Effects, LOTR:  Damn right.  Make Up, LOTR:  They better not be setting us up.  There was make-up in that movie?  Sound Mixing, LOTR:  Okay, this is looking really good; better follow through, Academy  Sound Editing, Master and Commander:  Is there a difference between Sound Mixing and Editing?  GO JULIA!  We love you Julia!  And your wispy, gaspy "yeah"s following a legend's legendary line.  And who came up with these lost dog Master Card commercials?  They're good shit!  We love you Oprah!  And your eye-shadow that matches your big bow-y dress.  Documentary short, (some mini-epic about the results of radiation exposure):  The housewife-director looked thrilled.  Stupid radiation, anyway.  Documentary feature, Fog of War:  It's the worst fog of them all!  Original Score, LOTR (Howard Shore):  We love you, Howard Shore!  Make love to us, Howard Shore!  Film Editing, LOTR:  Okay, really, this had better not be a damn ruse!  Original Song, Into the West:  Joe gets the line for this one:  "Here comes the rain again."  Foreign Language Film, The Barbarian Invasions:  Canadians know (and do) them best.  Cinematography, Master and Commander:  It's a good thing there wasn't any cinematography in LOTR  Adapted Screenplay, LOTR:  It's so in the bag.  Original Screenplay, Sophia Coppola:  KICK ASS!  But you're not going to be the first American Woman Best Director tonight, sorry.  Hope this makes up for it.  Director, Peter Jackson:  GO PETE!!  Waddle your way up there!  Don't stop to comb your hair!  WHAT? NO OVATION?  Go Bill and Joan, good job.  Actress, Charlize Theron:  Yay.  Now go do something with it.  Actor, Sean Penn:  HE gets Peter's ovation?  What the fuck?!  We DO love you, Bill!  Go Hollywood Foreign Press.  Picture, LOTR:  It made a clean sweep; it's in the company of Titanic and Ben-Hur for most-won awards in a night and STILL no ovation.  Good thing we're not bitter.
