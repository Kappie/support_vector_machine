And the note will have numbers, so you can respond to each part seperately.  (Your comments are so hard to understand sometimes.  Can't match up where a "loll" corresponds to, since I found nothing funny about my post.  Ah, well.)  Dearest Kailing Heart-  (1) I do sincerely resent that.  I so was not flirting with Jack.  I don't know where these silly notions are coming from.  For 1010 and Ning's information, while THEY were finding the time to gossip about little things like that, Jack and I were hauling desks from room to room.  Yes, that's right, we were actually  working .  Inconceivable as that may seem.  But it was tons and tons of fun.  The main reason we disappeared for so long like that was because Jack hates Tracey's guts.  It was so hilarious.  We saw you guys standing by the stairs, and so we went back and hid in the corridor.  Then you guys just STAYED there.  So then we had to come out to get to the G rooms.  (2) He was the one who dragged me to proctor with him.  I didn't volunteer to proctor with him.  He said, "Sunshine, come proctor with me.  I don't want to proctor by myself."  Then he went and found Anna and said, "Sunshine's proctoring first grade with me."  So I was like, "Okay... whatever."  So I went and proctored with him.  Though since I was the fourth first grade proctor, I had to keep running between to rooms in case someone had to go to the restroom or needed anything or something like that.  So every five minutes or so, I'd go out and check on the other two rooms.  First we played War.  But then the kids kept asking SO MANY questions... so then we were both up and about answering questions.  Then we were like, "Now what?  The kids are all finished."  So we just went and graded the tests.  We were master graders.  He graded first column (1-10), and I graded last column (21-30).  Then we both graded second column (11-20).  It was super fast.  We memorized the answers!  (3) Then we got dragged up to the grading room.  And since we were done already, we just wandered around.  Then we went out to put the desks back, but then we lazed out and just went to that lounge area and sat and talked for a while.  Then we got bored of sitting.  So we went around and pulled the signs off all the walls.  Then we went back to the room.  That's why we were gone so long, in case you were wondering.  (4) Then you and 1010 were by the laptop, so Jack and I just talked with Ning.  She is one bitter person.  She says that ranks are all screwed up because everyone in the top 10 cheats.  (I can't believe even SHE buys into that.  WE DON'T CHEAT!  I mean, ten people HAVE to be in the top ten, no matter what.)  Then she said, "I want to go to Harvard."  And Jack just told me earlier that afternoon that Harvard was the one school he wanted to go to.  So he just said, "Hn." to that.  Interesting, isn't it?  (5) So all in all, we just spent the entire day together.  -___-  BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.  We spent about five minutes arguing about what color the shirt was.  That is how inane our conversations were.  (6) That volunteer thing was FUN.  God, I loved it so much.  (NOT BECAUSE OF JACK.  Though he told me that he liked it, too.)  I want to do something like that again.  =D  (7) Would you like to tell me what else 1010 and Ning were saying about us?  (8) When Ning said something along the lines of, "You guys just want to spend time together" (before we went to "put the desks back", I think), Jack spent five minutes questioning me about why my friends were so strange.  Then he spent another five minutes complaining about how his friends thought the same thing.  -__-  But to a lesser degree, of course.  (9) Okay, now that I've spent a whole lot of words on Jack, let's talk about tomorrow.  I need a belt.  I must go get a belt.  Troy will be fun!  Jack watched it tonight.  When he told me he was going to watch it with Justin and Meng, I thought he meant Meng Meng at first, not Felix Meng.  So I was a bit freaked out.  (10) I went to BN today and got Nine Stories and that other book.  Yay!  Now I can read on the plane and in China.  I think I will reread His Dark Materials on the way to/in/from China.  I love that series!  It deserves to be reread.  *heart* Sunshine  OKAY THERE'S THE END OF THE "NOTE"!  Whoo.  I was back to Jack again, wasn't I?  Ah, well.  I read xxxHOLiC today.  It's interesting.  I think it's going to turn into my favorite CLAMP series.  (Except ERIOL-KUN!)  Okay, now I must go.  I want to sleep.  I slept at 2 this morning cuz I couldn't fall asleep, then I had to get up at 8.15.  Ahaha.
