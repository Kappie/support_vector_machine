I love all the kids there. Went swimmin' all day long 'cause there weren't many peeps there. Chelsea didn't show. Brian was like an hour late and when he showed he was dead tired. I wonder why. He wasn't in a very good mood either.  Oh! There was this guy from copper creek there, he was like 16 and had cool sk8ter boi curly hair, and he was wearing these totally ugly, colorful short shorts. It was SOOOO funny!! He walks past us councilers and we're all staring at him. He turns around and says to us, "Just to let you guys know, I don't usually wear these." I guess it was some inside joke, or a dare or something. It was pretty funny though. They barly reached his finger tips. buahahaha. For Mandy and Ashes: catagory=slug. hehehehe.  My dives were really really bad today. Nothing that felt even remotly like flying, and that's what a good dive's s'possed to feel like. Sat around mainly and teased people. It was fun.  Here's a few songs I've written lately:  -Victim-  She's so quiet/So alone/She wonders if/Light hurts her bone/She lies down her head/And wants to die/Can't go on/Breaths her last sigh/  He sits in the hallway/Kids moving past/Tears in his heart/Soul in a cast/Can't understand Where they all went/Just want to stop/They circumvent  These people/These lives/Just want to die/Give up/Give in/Wisper inside/Hope is gone/Victim  They lean up/Against grey walls/Box their minds/Echo in halls/'Give in'/'Give up'/Willing victims/Every one  Observer outside/Watches them lie/Betray themselves/'Wait to ask why'/Pain in His heart Tears in His eyes/Calls to them softly/Rebuilding their lives  -Censored-  (slightly humorous, cynical song.  tee hee.  Based on True Story)  I saw you today/I just wanted to flip you off/Tell you what I really think you are/But I didn't 'cause I wanted/To impress the guy you were with  Yeah/Sometimes it makes me mad/To see what you've become/Yeah/Sometimes I think you need/Some one to slap you real hard/And bring you back to reality/Yeah/How much longer can you run/Away from me/Turn and face-  I saw you today/Skating down the road/Trying to pretend/You didn't have a care/Who do you think you are?  Yeah/Sometimes I just wanna scream/Stomp and shout/Yeah 'Cause the words I would use/Just couldn't be put in this song/It'd be one big BEEEEP Yeah/How much longer will you run/Away from reality/Turn and face/Me  I saw you today/I thought I would wave/You turned your head and kept on talking/I went on my way and kept on talkin'/But I can't give up on you  Signing off  Jak - poet
