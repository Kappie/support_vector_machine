"mm nothing i just got realy dizzy there for a moment. so i went and gave the people there coffee and went to goget the menus andit was like the floor fell out from beneath me. i put the coffee on the table and went to pull a chair out from the table and i just wasn't fast enough and i kinda slowly fell to the floor. fuck that must have been funny to see. the customers were all going, "what the fuck?!?!?!" and jimmy and robert were buzzing around lifting me up, giving me juice, lecturing me on my color. lol being sweetly annoying. kathy right there in the brunt of it. "get her some juice" she says to jimmy. just about shit myself. lol   other than that not much else is going on. look at this town...fucking miracle when something does happen.
