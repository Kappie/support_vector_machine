I would never act like that in my normal setting of life in Hillsboro, and I think this started because it was something I could control, or atleast I thought I could. When things started out they were great, I didn't worry about what was next or how you felt, but now.....Its like tension all the time, or like your always in another state of mind when we're together. I would like to have a serious talk with you but you would just laugh it off or change the subject, but whatever.
