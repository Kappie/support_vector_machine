Super happy to be done of stupid ancient history, as amusing as it was, Im so glad to be done of his stupid tests that make no sense.  Although me and Kate did come up with some great pickup lines from the course.. my favourites were "Wanna see my gupta?" and "those are the biggest ma'muns I have ever seen!"  Unfortunetly nothing about our intelligent conversation-starters were on the exam.  Oh and Lauren, well you're the only one that reads this anyway, so of course Im going to talk about you. Like this:   astoria.  she crashed like an atom bomb says: IT;S MORGAN... SHE'S DONE OF SCHOOL... I HATE HER astoria.  she crashed like an atom bomb says: oh hey, how are you   Hahahha. You make me laugh... We are so witty. [Did I mention that modesty is over rated]   YES  Toga BBQ at Morgans for the first day of summer!   Listening To:  Bang Bang - Nancy Something. [A Lauren song.]
