Siru gave me her program today from her little finnish christmas singing service thing and made me read it so i could get better on my pronunnciation.  Jeez, i start to get a headache when she makes me start to read finnish, so i had to take it home to practice with......not that i know what any of it means but i know its about Christ and stuff.  Siru is going to Finland to see her family and she told me that if i want any finnish gum, i have to be extra nice to her and not hurt her for not liking Kyle anymore.  Man, i thought they were going to get married too!  Meh, there's still time.  Speaking of marriage, i've got 12 people and counting plus my parents thinking i'm going to get married to this one guy....why we're thinking about this now, i have no idea because i'm only 15 going on 16.  But yeah, thats whats going on.  One of my old teachers that i'm really good friends with was all telling me about all these stories where people meet the person they're going to marry at 15-16 yrs old.  It happened to her too.  Her husband now was just a summer fling back then and then she moved away and they met back up at college.  Freaky freaky.  And my Niko's fiancee, he's known since they were 14.  Michael Owen's girlfriend/fiancee (its not final yet), he's known her since they were 6 and they grew up together!  So i guess its possible, but i doubt it.  Meh, its fun to joke around about anyways.    This week i've decided to pretty much blow off everything.  Do my homework with the least amount of effort and study for my tests just a little bit the night before then proceed to cram 10 mins before the test.  I have a bad case of senioritis and i've still got a tri and 1/2 to go of this year and then a whole other year to go before i'm a senior.  Juniors and Seniors now tell you that sophmore year sucks......and it kinda does because you're not planning anything for your senior year (ex: motto, shirts, rings) and you have to worry about GPA/rank and all that stuff.  Its kinda like a boring middle year.    Interesting things that happened today: * i talked to my ex-fling Kevin H. for the first time since June (the month where we stopped liking each other because of the whore he fell for, lol) today......it was awkward but nice and i got to tell him what i really think about his now ex-whore-girlfriend.  It was fun. * I discovered just how much i OWN Nathan Lacey, i feel powerful lol * Brittnee was sick at home today! But it was kinda nice because when i got home, i got to talk to her for longer than usual before she's rushing off to dance or whatever....we don't get to talk as often as we like any more because dance has taken over her life again. * Brittnee told me that i have no confidence and thats why i'm afraid to take risks....i dunno if she's right though.....because i did take that risk when i went up to Sam Parnell and asked him if i could take his picture......and that time when i IMed this certain guy all by myself when Brittnee was away in California.....Yeah what now Brittnee, i have confidence just sometimes i have to draw the line, lol!  And now its time to read up on the spark notes for my mythology book for english! byeeeeee!  Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~
