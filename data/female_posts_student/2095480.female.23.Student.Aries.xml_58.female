I am using in a same sort of fashion in that I'm going there after graduation. However, I am not going for "fun", rather, I got a job there.  That's right everyone,  I'm moving to ORLANDO!  I believe I will be certtifiably OUT of Valdosta on August 18th. Its an interesting feeling... leaving Valdosta.  I regret to say I won't have that "2 month chill time" that I really wanted though. I was looking forward to moving to Ft. Myers for a while and just enjoying the beaches and the company of  Irene  and  Scott . [Apologies to Scott.] However, after six months of being a peon for Disney, I can really become anything or go anywhere with them. Last night, when talking to Mom, I teased, "Hey, wouldn't working at EuroDisney be awesome!" She teased back, we paid five years tutition for you to be a Donald Duck. Well, no offense, but I'd rather be a Nala, for she is my favorite Disney character. Why? She was the true heroine of Lion King. It was she that went out into the unknown to find help. I think that can definately be looked up to albeit a fictional story.   I had my last final this morning, and I feel very good about it. Folks start getting here on Thursday evening/night and graduation is of course on Saturday.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  As you can see, I have now set up a chatter box so we can talk via this website. So far its been alot of fun,  and I encourage everyone to use it - even if you are some random reader. [I'm curious... are there any random readers I don't know of?] Anyway, I've been trying to add a picture of Nala on the page too - and as you can see, I have yet to be successful. I'm going to keep working on that!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Well, folks... its time to party. 10:30 Saturday, my place. I'm finally graduating! YAY!
