It's too easy to stay as you are, if you're horrible then every one will expect you to be horrible, it's quite hard to break that loop. Some people can't be bothered to put the energy in to change. I'm a optomist about that. I think that people can change. What if people can't thought? What is Rosie's destined to be a horrible deceitful bitch for the rest of the life? How will we cope! But seriously... hmm... Ahh I better go do homework, go my children of the night and think about changing, and if you should.
