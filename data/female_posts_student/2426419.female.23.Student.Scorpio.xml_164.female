Well, I didn’t feel well enough to go to the bible study, so I just sort of hung out with mom all day. we went to Sears because we needed a new phone (two handsets were included, so mine is charging up in my room right now). then we went to Target so mom could buy a painting by an artist she likes (I forget his name – Dediere something), and then, since I wanted to go to Norman, we drove to Norman.  Travis called today on his way rock climbing. I think it’s nice that he called. I was pretty surprised, and we run out of things to talk about after awhile, but it’s great he still sort of wants to be my friend. He must if he calls me on the phone, even if it isn't very often. Anyway, it made me happy. So did the book of poetry I found at Barnes and Noble when I went to Norman. It is called “The Hell with Love.” Each word of the title (on the cover) is written on one of those heart candies that taste like chalk. The book is hilarious. I was laughing out loud at the section titles right there by the poetry shelves. Everyone in the store probably thought I was crazy, but who knew poetry could be so amusing? I am taking another day off of work tomorrow. I don’t know if I will feel well enough to substitute in the morning.  I’ll probably go to the film and spirituality discussion on Monday night. Anyways, I’m having lots of fun here at home lately. Hanging out with friends, working a little, reading books – it’s a lot like summer vacation. And Josh Dyer is really nice to hang out with just because, well – he’s been my friend for just about ever, and he treats me very well. I mean, I can’t imagine him ever saying anything mean or discouraging to me at all.  I go to the orthodontist again this week on Wednesday. I guess I can tell that my teeth are getting straighter. my gums get torn up a lot, so I have to cover my front bottom two braces with wax. I'll have them off before I'm 25. Geez, that's such a long ways from now.  I guess that I will read Isabel Allende’s  Paula  next. I’m actually about 30 pages into it. Maybe I can read a couple of books at once. I need woman empowerment. Arrrrg. That’s the sound of a real woman. Um, or pirates. Who knows? I want to hear back from graduate schools, I really do. I feel that I am ready to go to grad school. I should be reading important things, filling in the literary gaps, but I’ve been hanging out with Jaci and the Jacob’s Well people a lot. I wish there was a good way to advertise the bible study. I should have brought a poster to Barnes and Noble or Starbucks. I would like more people to come.  Anyway, Miss Saigon was wonderful, absolutely awe-inspiring, worthy of re-evaluating my life. Before the show, Josh D. and I went to eat at Chili's and I had the lime shrimp and chicken with veggies and drank mango tea. I just love good food. Anyway, maybe I'll get to the kitchen for a snack and dip into  Paula  or maybe another book. I have decided that I can read more than one book at a time. I mean, I'm sort of in the middle of  Woman: An Intimate Geography  anyway. Maybe I'll pick that book up and read a chapter. I think the next chapter is on breast milk. I'm so glad that applies to me.  I slept in this morning, so I'm really not that tired. sweet dreams everyone. may there be sparkles for you all and perhaps a cup of iced green tea.
