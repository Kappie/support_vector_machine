In recent history, I can't really remember a time in the past few days when I could just use the bathroom without rolling up my pants. I really think it's Shoan Yin's fault...I remember one day I knew the floor was perfectly dry. I took a shower. Toweled off. The floor was still relatively dry. Sarah's complained about it before, so it can't be her. I don't think it's Ishita. Or whoever's doing it, stop it, really. It's disgusting, and it's not going to go away...  And then last night and just now I found blood on the toilet seat. I mean, come on. It's definitely not me. When one flushes the toilet, one should notice if one left blood there. I wiped it off once. There's more today. I mean, what the hell! It's not that hard...and there shouldn't be blood there anyway.  Ok, so maybe I'm guilty of shedding hair (I try not to...) and leaving kleenex all over my desk, but I try not to dirty public areas. Should I confront the roomies about it? It's just not pleasant.  Arr.
