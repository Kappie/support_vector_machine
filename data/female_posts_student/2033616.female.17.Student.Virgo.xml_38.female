I was supposed to babysit for Hansen last night... but no can do when you're temp. is upwards of 100 degrees.  Hopefully she found someone to replace me.  Church this morning... ho hum... but there's a video scavanger hunt this afternoon which is looking not so promising.... WHO'S GONNA GO WITH ME?
