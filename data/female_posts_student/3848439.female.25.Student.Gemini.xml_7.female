I figured I'd listen to the actual song "Man in Black" and see what it's about, since it's such a large part of his mythos.  So, I love it.  I'm a big fan of black clergy wear myself.  If I had my druthers I'd probably wear only black clergy gear, especially outside of services at my particular church.  And I heard this song and somehow want to work it into my ordination service or afterparty in Summer 2007.  To fully appreciate the song, you have to know a bit about the man.  To learn more about the life of Johnny Cash I suggest this  urlLink article from CMT.com.   There's also this wonderful audio story from  urlLink the NPR show "This American Life."   It's in Act Three, entitled "The Greatest Love Story of the 20th Century" by Sarah Vowell.  (You'll need Real Player to listen.)  While this particular song leans a little toward the pessimistic, I think it also speaks to the prophetic role that pastors and priests are called into.  We have to make sure that folks know the world isn't operating the way God intends.  Creation is at war with itself and it's not supposed to be that way.  People don't take care of anyone - themselves or especially others.  So for your perusal, below are the lyrics to Johnny Cash's "Man in Black."  Enjoy! ============ Man In Black By: John R. Cash, Â© 1971 House of Cash, Inc. Recorded February 16, 1971 Number 3 - Country Charts; Number 58 - Pop Charts       Well, you wonder why I always dress in black, Why you never see bright colors on my back, And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone. Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.  I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, But is there because he's a victim of the times.  I wear the black for those who never read, Or listened to the words that Jesus said, About the road to happiness through love and charity, Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.  Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose, In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes, But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back, Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.  I wear it for the sick and lonely old, For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold, I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been, Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.  And, I wear it for the thousands who have died, Believen' that the Lord was on their side, I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died, Believen' that we all were on their side.  Well, there's things that never will be right I know, And things need changin' everywhere you go, But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right, You'll never see me wear a suit of white.  Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day, And tell the world that everything's OK, But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back, 'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black.
