We celebrate the 4th with hotdogs, family, friends, and great fireworks, but do we remember why?  Aside from this day being one of the most historically significant days in the history of our country, the 4th of July bears a symbolic significance that is hard to ignore.  One this day, years ago, the declaration of independance was signed.  Years later, it was also the day that Thomas Jefferson and John Adams died.    So let us take a moment to remember those who died for the formation of this freedom we enjoy so freely!  ~Kristyn   PS. 5 days to moving day!
