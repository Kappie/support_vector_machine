I mean initially I really wanted to watch Matrix, but the others suggested that we will watch 'Matrix Reloaded' after watching 'Matrix' on Channel 5 on Sunday.... Never mind, but A Word Of Caution For You for 'Darkness Falls' ---- Bring EARMUFFS. The movie was only about 1 and a half hours short and although I was covering my ears the whole time, the 'ghost' a.k.a 'the tooth fairy', I could hear her screaming throughout the movie. @_@ Actually this movie in short is about this disfigured 'tooth fairy' who would kill children or adults if anybody sees her. But usually it is the kids, as after dropping their last baby tooth, they must not peek at the tooth fairy or she will kill you.. Fortunately, she is scared of light, so, stay in lighted places. So this male character saw her when he was small and it killed her mother, thus, he lived in fear of darkness till he grew up. He saw his childhood sweetheart's brother having the same experience and this 'tooth fairy' began to terrorise the whole neighourbood. I really hate watching horror movies so I praticularly covered my ears throughout the movie....   And in a way it is very funny as I used to keep my baby teeth (2 of them) and kept it under my bed.. Nothing happened.... BUT NOW, I have four adult teeth (extraction for braces) kept in a bottle and STILL NOTHING HAPPENED! So this is a living proof that tooth fairy does not exist, OK,  maybe she does not exist in my area or Singapore...
