It doesn't matter if it can make me happy. Some people say that fight anything for happiness. I'm not even fighting. I'm dreaming of it. Dreams and imaginations are separated by a fine line, but it seems to me that it has a big difference. Brown Moth, can I be your Moonlight Butterfly? The love you offer seems like a fantasy? I would like to fly. Very much.    You didn't seems so real the nights after that. it was only Violet who accompanied me. But he couldn't swim beyond my imagination. He just fills me with awe with his shades of purple. He's truly beautiful. I'm glad I bought it. he's just like me. I tried to dream you up. You didn't come. You weren't so real. But I glad you dropped by my room that night. Sorry I chased you out. That was impolite of me. But still, you left on your own accord. I couldn't really see your face. All I know is that you had dark brown hair falling over your eyes. But you are no more but just a memory now. It's just Violet and me.
