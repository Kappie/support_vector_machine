I had tennis practice this morning until ten, so I had to bicycle home in a fury to take a quick shower and be at the center by eleven. I wore a cute outfit, and did my hair too, because you gotta dress up for these things, and it poured on me halfway there. But it was so much fun jumping in the puddles. I wish someone was with me, but I still succeeded in getting soaked and having a blast. Haha, and my hair got so unbelievably curly because of it!  Chad was at the center with me for about an hour, and I swear to God he gets cuter everyday. So not "dating material," but a great friend nonetheless.   I love happy old people. They are just the thing to make a bad day better.
