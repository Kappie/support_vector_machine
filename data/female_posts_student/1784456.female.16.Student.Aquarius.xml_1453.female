I knew if I left it alone and did nothing everything would turn out alright! *my philosophy on life... you should see my room...* Yeah, I'm still waiting for that to work itself out, at the moment it looks like an elephant has sat down in it. Hey, no rude comments on me! *it was because Izzy came round* Teehee. Picking on friends is fun. So long as they realise that you don't really mean it... Actually all the butt jokes have made me very butt conscious! Err... okay... so the webpage is err blank and empty... but the posts are on the blogger posting admin thingy that I have! *that's alright then* Hmm... I really need Blogger Pro don't I! *yep, obsesseeee*
