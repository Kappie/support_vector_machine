We used to be best friends @ religious school but after Hebrew High we sorta fell out because we never saw each other.  I'm going to hang out with him tomorrow.  Sick!  There is nothing better than seeing an old friend!  Oh man, I'm so happy and excited, but I'm just hoping we mesh real well together like we used to.  I would hate it if we drove around for fucking hours and didn't say one thing.  Yuck.  Oh well, I'm off to see the first episode of Teen Titans.  I hope all the babies with drama can give it to Hata and be happy.  Be glad everyone.  Everyone be happy, I'm pretty happy.  In fact, I'm going to brag and say that I am relatively happy most of the time.  The only sad part of my life is being lonely every once in awhile, school sometimes, not knowing the future, death, and when I am fighting with someone in this group or Cortland or John.  I like it when you do it like THURR!  Oh man, I feel a good mood coming on.  :)
