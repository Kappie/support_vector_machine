Friday...I cleaned the house and put my room together, well most of it, ran a set of 24s, then Jake came and got me so we could get pizza than we went to his house to eat and for some reason I cant remember what we did...lol...Im totally blank...oh yeah oh yeah...we watched The Sixth Sense...and I remembered why I stopped watching it..Then Saturday I went to Jakes and we started making shirts (for football) and we went to pick up food from chilis. Then I ended up having to go to work at 5 and happily got off at 9 and went back to Jakes to work on my shirt. Which brings me to this MEMO   If you would like to be part of the Indian Pow-Wow this football season...then let me know so that you can get a shirt. Indian Pow Wow Shirts are $10. So just let me know your size and what name you would like to have on the back. It will take two days for your shirt to be made unless I can start in the morning....than just one. So if you need one call my cell (817) 909-7194 or IM me.    Then Sunday I went to wal-mart with my mom and I got this cute new hat and some school stuff. Then I went to Jakes to finish my shirt...even though its still not done because we ran into technical difficulties with mine. lol. And we went out to the lake on the boat for a couple of hours. Came home and we watched this show on KERA...lol. And we played "steamroller" lmao. Then eventually I came home. Today I woke up early for some reason at about 8:30, finally got out of bed at 9, drank some soup, and ran a set of 12s. Now here we are...bored and waiting for Jake to get done working out....then if you need me later I'll be at work from 6-9. Till then, Later Days
