The best part - The Man is trying to stop him from doing this, they're calling it vandalism. But they can't figure out how to bring charges against someone who is wiping away dirt to leave his "tag".    As he says in the interview:    "I'm waiting for the kind of Monty Python court case where exhibit A is a pot of cleaning fluid and exhibit B is a pair of my old socks," he jokes.    (there's an audio link to the radio story. listen.)
