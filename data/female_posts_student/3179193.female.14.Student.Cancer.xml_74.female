To death.   I need ice-cream right now... Erica should know why. Yesterday was only cos I was grouchy all day but today... different story. Screw it. Who cares... Don't feel like doing anything.   Wtf. That's all I have to say about it. Blah.   Moses "sprained" his toe so he couldn't participate in gym class. Weird. How do you "sprain" your toe? Oh well... I hope he's okay though. It was a bit funny in gym class... we were doing laps and I was racing Ioana for fun. All of a sudden, Moca fell. Iunno... she was falling face first and landed on her back. Mad funny. Too bad I didn't video tape that. She really fell head over heels for Poodle Tree. Haha! Anyway... So bored. BrB... blog later. Gonna help Derry.
