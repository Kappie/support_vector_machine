Eleanor: (on tv) I always wanted to have an adventure. Now things are making noises at night, ghost children are talking to me... I love this house. Thomas: What a psycho! "I'm so happy to be scared out of my mind!"  "Good demons! Good demons." -Thomas when Hugh Crane got pulled into hell or purgatory or whatever it was by these weird stone demon things  "Tonight, I talked to my brotha from anotha motha... actually he's my biological brother. I did make waffles though." -Malorie
