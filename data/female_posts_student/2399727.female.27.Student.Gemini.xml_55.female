       
      Today was mercifully less eventful.  Did some reading and got two books polished off, so tomorrow I can dedicate all of my time to transcribing, reorganizing my disks, updating my bibliography and working on my "vision of Church".  A priest-friend just recommended I look at  Gaudium et Spes  and  Lumen Gentium .  I feel like I'm entering the twilight zone that I'm looking at such texts of my own volition...  More to come...
