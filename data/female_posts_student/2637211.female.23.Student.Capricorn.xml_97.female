So I decided to go look for it, because I knew vagely where the shopping center it was supposed to be at. I finally got there, and I drove around the center and I couldn't find the water store. And instead of parking and shopping at the grocery store at that center, I suddenly had this horrible feeling of dread and I didn't want to force myself to go in. So I just kept driving until I got home, and throughout the drive (which was rather long), I got more and more freaked out, and I got into my apartment and nearly cried. I'm freaking out. It's really scary, and I feel like a big moron to not feel able to interact with normal people in normal settings. I know I should just go and face my fears, but I think I'll just wait until Jerm gets here tonight so I can go to the store with him and feel less vulnerable. Sometimes I just get so freaked out about going outdoors and running errands. It's really weird, and I probably need therapy. But the idea of calling to make appointments freaks me out even more. God, I'm such a freak.
