I had a customer at my counter who I saw out of the corner of my eye (well I saw that there was someone there) and I contintued to stare with eyes glazed over at people's blogs for about 3 minutes before I acknowledged she was there.  I acutally had the audacity to say with a straight face "Oh, I'm sorry I was ignoring you, I thought you were someone who worked here."
