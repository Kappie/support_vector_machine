Then Mike, Mark, Chris, and Gary show up to pick up Dan to go do stuff for Mark's birthday. So being the crazy bored kids that we were, we decided to tag along. Then some whores showed up and whatnot, but they weren't important. We went to the movies to see The Village (which sucked my nonexistant penis, by the way) and Chris drove all of us gals and we talked about silly things such as uteruses and bad things that I accidentally say, and such (mwahahaha) and weirded him out in the car. It was excellent-ay. So after the movie it was like 12 and we went to the Taco Bell drive-thru shindig and got some mexican pubes and such. Then we met up with Gary, Mark, Mike and Dan in the back parking lot of the nearby Wal-Mart. We had a nice little taco picnic (wink wink, it was a beautiful little taco/sausage party). Then we played car tag around the parking lot and threw beverages and garbage and other nonsensical objects at each other, and then we drove home and Chris drove on the wrong side of the road halfway there. It was gorgeous. Then Marky Sweet Cheeks puked all over Gary's vehicle. That was also gorgeous. Then... I don't know, it was kind of over after that. But, honestly, that was the most fun I've had in a while. :-)    ....aaaaaand stuff.   The End.
