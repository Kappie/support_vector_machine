For the past three months I've been trying to get rid of him. I'd send him a random message, always curt, and never starting with just Hi. I wanted to make him fight for me, to make him prove that he really wanted me. And most of all to make him hurt. I would watch my buddy list without blinking when he was on, waiting for him to send me a message. A usual "love you" or "miss you" But it hurted the most when those messages stopped all together.   Isn't this what I wanted? I don't have to worry about creepy guys anymore. I don't have to worry about wheither or not I could say no, because he's lost the will to ask. Isn't that what I was going for? I don't have to worry about wheither or not I'm lying when I tell him I love him, because he doesn't say it to me anymore. I don't have to worry about feeling lonely or empty when he goes off to college.   Because that's what I'm feeling now.
