Why does my grandmother say such awful things? Why did she have to say them today? Why can't I just be let alone? Why do I need this?  they don't have to understand me. They don't have to coddle me. All they have to do is stay civil. All they have to do is care enough that I don't hurt too much, and I'm hurting too much right now.  I've never felt like this before. So angry and sad and insane. Like I can't even control my own thoughts. Like I don't even think being dead could make me feel better. Is that possible? To be sad to a point above suicide?   I have to write this research report. I have to.  why does she hate it when I blog? I told her it's therapy, she said that was a crock of shitt. I told her it wasn't a good day to be making such snide comments like she'd been doing since I got home. She didn't stop.   I can't do anything else.
