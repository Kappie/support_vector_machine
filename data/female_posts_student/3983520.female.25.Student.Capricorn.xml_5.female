I would say that I won a total of maybe $400 or $500 but I played majority of it back and spent the rest on my leisure activities throughout the weekend. Okay it might not have been that much but I only ended up spending $200 of my own and I did a lot. I went shopping, gambling, clubbing and ate whenever I had a chance and I only spent $200. So I had to win a good amount. I want to go back to Vegas soon or if not Vegas just any other vacation spot will be fine with me.  I think everyone had a good time though. We had some rocky moments but we worked through them and made the most out of a once in a lifetime trip. Well at least for the bride to be, you only get married once, well that's how it used to be. LOL Thanks to everyone who traveled to Vegas you guys all made the trip a lot of fun. Hope to do it again soon. I know for sure it won't be my wedding though. LOL
