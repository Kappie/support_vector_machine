My brother bought the engagement ring yesterday, and I was the first family member to see it!!!  :-)  It's gorgeous!  It's a very good quality, 1/2 carat diamond solitaire ring.  It's so exciting... and what's even more exciting is that my brother will most likely be engaged in 2 weeks time!  :-D  Hooray...    Other News    Classes are coming to an end very quickly.  I'm thinking it may actually be a very real possibility that I make the Dean's List... and that pleases me a LOT.  Um, let's see..?  Yeah, I still haven't started my 10 page term paper.  But, I'm not all that worried about it.  I'm very familiar with the subject... so I will be fine.  As for my other classes.  In my music class, we have to put together a play.  Our group has decided to do the story of the 3 Little Pigs... but with a twist.  We're going to present it as a "Breaking News" story.  There will be a reporter, and she will interview the 3 little pigs, and the big bad wolf.  We're excited.  I'M excited too, because I get to compose all the music stuff.  :-)  YAY!  I've also had quite an interesting week.  I've totally aced all my music class stuff... my last quiz and proficiency.  I aced my World Lit quiz... and most likely the last one that I just took on Thursday.  I have one more paper to write and email to the prof by Tuesday at 5.  Then I get to work on all my stuff for other classes.  :-)  I'm so ready for classes to be over, because then I'm going to Port Aransas with the family, and I hope to come back home with a good looking tan, and a well-rested body...!!!  :-D  I don't start my summer classes til June 9, so that should give me a good amount of time to find and secure a job.  I was thinking of applying at a different daycare place, but only if I'm assured that I'll be in a classroom of preschoolers or kindergarten aged kids.  No more diaper changing for me.  :-)  And I was also thinking of getting a weekend job for the summer at that new place on Walzem "Firehouse Pub and Grill."  I figured I could make some good money in tips or something.  And I'd only do that during the summer.  But we'll see.  I mean, if I'm gonna get like, $7 an hour at a daycare (which is possible with my experience) then I may just do that.  :-)  Okay, that's all for now.  I'll post more another time.
