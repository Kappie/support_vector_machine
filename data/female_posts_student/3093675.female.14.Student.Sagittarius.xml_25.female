An animal rights website that has different sections about the various topics that come up in discussions on animal rights: the meat industry, hunting and fishing, animal testing, circuses, spaying and neutering, what to eat and wear, etc. and a section with links to various interviews (text audio and video) with different bands, actors, etc. that are involved with animal rights  2. A links database on various activism things- animal rights, anti-war, anti-police brutality, anti-racism, anti-sweatshop, etc. etc. this would be easier to maintain, because i already have one website that I'm working on ( urlLink http://www.myeyelinertears.xnapster.com  , it's a Good Chalrotte fansite)and I don't really feel like working on 2 extensive websites alone, especially once school starts.  But enough about that, it's time to talk about MY NEW BASS GUITAR!! That's right folks, I finally got it! It needs some work, and a few new things like a gig bag and a strap, but I'm so glad i finally have it! It's a left handed, pale yellow fender prescision (sp?) bass. YAY!!!!  Anyway, before i go i will leave you with 2 video interviews that Anti-Flag did with Peta2. The first one is their singer, Justin Sane, talking about the alley cat he recently adopted (or at least it was recently when the interview was done i don't know exactly when that was) and the 2nd is the whole band.   urlLink  Justin alone     urlLink  The Whole Band    Peace, Love, Unity, Caitlin
