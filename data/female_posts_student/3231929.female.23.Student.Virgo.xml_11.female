There's only so many times I can wiggle on my chair before I start getting funny looks. Luckily the afternoon session went a bit better and I was wide awake for Non-accidental Injury and Common Paediatric Surgical Problems.  Mum rang this afternoon twice. She'd been in to see the solicitor about Gran's will and apparently my aunt wasn't an executor (as sheexpected she would be!) - oh dear I could see some sparks flying here. Then casting my mind back I rememberedhow a few years ago Gran and Ann had 'words' and Gran mentioningchanging her will;but I'd assumed, like Mum, she'd changed it back. Obviously not! I think it was probably a reflexion of how far Ann had drifted from Gran that Gran didn't hold her in that high aregard, insteadone of my Great Aunts will be an executor as well as the family solicitor and Mum. I don't really know how Ann took the news, Mum said something about a 'brave face' but it's difficult to judge on the phone.  I've set myself a target of >2000 words of elective project to be written by the weekend, so I'd better get cracking!
