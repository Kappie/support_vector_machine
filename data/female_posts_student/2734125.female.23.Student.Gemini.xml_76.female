I walked through the wedding that I was part of, well, mostly walked, sometimes fell, but that is a terribly embarrassing story that I will leave for another time.  After I was done with the wedding I lost my voice; literally after all of my part was done, and the bride was driving away, as if magickally timed, my voice left me.  I drove home, almost falling asleep at the wheel (I had not slept for about 36 hours at that point) and fell into arms of friends.   What is the significance of this illness?  I believe that my body, my soul, my universe has decided its quiet time.  Even while I am entertaining old flames, I am resting my heart.  Yesterday I went to work and went home after about five minutes of not being able to talk to the kids above a whisper.  I came home to an empty house, and read, and drank tea, and slept.  I slept for 15 hours, in that tossing turning low feverish kind of sleep that is almost like a vision quest.  In an early dream my roommate and I were in a theatre, and were either putting together a play or something like it, maybe role-playing, and people kept coming in, and a movie was starting.  We wandered around a bit, left and returned, and then I walked into a huge theatre, with a movie.  I thought about getting seats, but just kept walking.  There were multiple layers to the theatre, many screens, thousands of seats, and most of them filled.  Some kind of arena.  I walked to the south, and found a place that was like a street.  People there, smoking, some hippie kids maybe.  I then went east into a grassy spot with a tree and lights that could have been filtered through the benches far above me, or could have been stars.  I sat down and found that a girl had followed me.  She asked me some inane question, and I felt a real question in her, so I asked, "why did you really follow me?  What do you really want to know?"  She repeated her inane question, as if afraid, and I said again, "what is your real question?" then she wandered off.  This fragment of the dream stuck with me through the night.  All the dreams were lucid and tight, sharp as reality.  I was walking far, and encountering many people.  At one point my cheek was touching frozen rain on an old wooden porch.  There was ice in the rain, and the cold was so crisp, and I thought, "and who is to say this isn't a dream? That this is not reality?" And I woke again, and again sank into a thousand quick night moments.  I woke up at 7am, before my alarm, and my voice had partly returned.  Today I have been coughing, expelling something from my system, some fear that I was unable to name.    Tonight I bowed out of going anywhere, and instead put my house in order, cleaning the kitchen, opening mail that I had been avoiding, picking up the house.  It felt good, even though by the end I felt a little more fevered then I had before.  I was being quickly taught, and as the universe, my mother, my father, my soul keeper knows, there is a time for learning and a time for thinking.  Almost all the questions of my life are out of town or too busy to recall me.  Convenient time to be forced into quiet.  One of my anomalies has been urging me to seek out quiet, to seek out stillness.  Did he know that the universe would do it for me?  I doubt it.  But, as always, I have been forced into reconsidering: how do I know when my heart is closed off?  Is it ever?  The balance I had come to was so sure, each new thing being taken in a stride I never knew I had reached, a dance that didn't seem to need much learning.  And then, there is something that makes you stumble, or at least, makes me stumble.  It makes me recall that I am clumsy at times, with my own heart, and with others.  I am not as graceful, or as gracefilled, as I sometimes appear.  I am recalling the steps, but I am willing to question their worth.  Old wounds are throbbing now, and I doubt they will be long ignored.  Perhaps my wildness is done for a time.  Maybe it is time to sit on the bench and watch again, as much as I can.  The tune of life always gets me up again, sooner then is likely good for me.  When I am in a park, with drummers pounding out a beat that is somehow beyond everything else, I will dance until I cant breath, and then more.  I will fly in hip moving circles and swing my hair and stomp.  I cant help it.  I was made to.  I was made to be a perfect dancer in some way, and I discover that way everyday, a little.  I cant imagine moving back to where I was.  The learning that has happened is too deep.  This doesn't mean that I am ready for the whole of it yet.  Breath, Morgan.  Breath and heal.  Let your body rest, and it will tell you when its time to fly.  It will tell you when its time to dance and sign again.  Breath till then, find stillness and quiet.
