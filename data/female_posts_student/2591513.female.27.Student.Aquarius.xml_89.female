Well, I wanted to blog old friends that have come and gone, but never left my heart.  I guess what sparks this blog is the e-mail I got from a very dear old friend.  As many of you know, I don't have very many friends that I talk with.  I guess when you have three kids and in the military life, you don't have too much to talk about other than your kids and the military life.  I have been thinking about my old friends from high school.  I don't think there have been a group of people that have come to mean so much to me than these people...of course there are exceptions to the rule...lol  But seriously, these people hold a very special place in my heart, that is why they are all godparents to my children.  First there is Keiko.  She was my other half.  I don't think I have shared that type of closeness with anyone else.  I think of her as more my sister than my friend.  I miss her, life had gotten so busy we haven't been able to talk too much, but she is definitely one person I will always have a lot of love and respect for. I am so proud of the woman she has become.  Then there is Megan, who I don't get to talk to too much.  She is a teacher...she is what I want to be when I grow up.  She was always the one to not BS to you, she always told it as it was.  There's Josh, who always inspired me to be my best and who always reminded me that not only was I loved, but that I was stronger than what I thought. He is finishing up with Medicine...how awesome is that?  Then there is Kristian, whom always lent an ear and gave the best hugs (actually I think my circle of friends all gave great hugs now that I think about it).  He was getting into radio, I am not sure how that went.  Of course, there's Tim.  I met him in the 7th grade though, and he as well as Ed have been my friends for so long.  I can't imagine my life without them.  Anyway, I miss these people.  I don't talk to them very often anymore, but I do think about them oftena dn miss them a lot.  I have nothing but love and respect for these people and hope that one day our paths will all cross again.
