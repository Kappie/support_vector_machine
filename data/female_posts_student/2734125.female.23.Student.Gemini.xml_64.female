It was relaxing and a little stressful not having enough to do, but there you go.  When that wind-down occurs, that slow resettling into a clam life, a relaxed life, well, it just isn't always comfortable.  Good news, at least to me, is that my words came back.  For a while after writing for about 5 days for 12 hours a day, I felt drained of language, helpless and unable to speak or write.  Nothing came, tapped, sucked dry, and my mind a murk of syllables and meaningless sound.  I suppose each sound did have meaning, just none that a society had assigned it.  It meant to me that I was done for a bit.    However, these last few days its been returning.  Good.  Feels like water.  I wrote a poem for my mom that I think had some merit.  We'll see if she likes it.  It wasn't an ode to my mom, it was actually for her to use in a graduation ceremony I think, for one of her students.  I tweaked her original rough concepts into something that felt more vibrant to me.  May have been a little intense, but I was ready to write again, and it needed to not be done in mild halfs.    I got a job a few minutes ago.  I will be working all summer in a day camp with the oldest campers (I am bound somehow to get the older and more rowdy crowd... Its for the best... Maybe I am still learning to love them...).  I will be out in the sun, riding my bike, playing in the park, getting tan and soaking up the summerness of the world.  My weekends will be perfectly free, my weekdays lovely and late, moving into the evening smooth and joyful.  I can't wait.  I am constantly amazed at what we receive, the gifts that we are given, the gentle pushes we get to confirm that we are living on a path strewn with coincidence presents.  I fly back to town, and get a call for a job.  Perfect.  Almost too perfect, and I am unwilling to ignore the artfulness of it.  As we walk and move and dance in this life there are so many subtle times, good and bad, that are just too close.    I heard about a family that was crushed by a bridge recently.  It was up in a canyon, a new exit, still being built.  There was a huge cross beam that was wrongly placed.  It had been put on its side, and slowly began to bend under its own weight.  An architect saw it and called dispatch, but a confusion of language made them think that he was talking about a road sign.  The car was crushed under the beam, mother, father, child and the mom pregnant.  There were no other cars for miles around.  There was only a split second of time that it could have fallen, they could have been there, in which it could all occur.  If they had gone one mile per hour faster here, one slower there... makes you think.  Makes you consider the timing of it.  How could it not?  Is luck god?  Maybe.    The job that I received, well the person that had been hired for it quit at the last minute, and I was there, just flown in, ready and hoping that I would be cared for by the universe again, my mother who I will never surpass or know fully.  Its all in the letting go, the asking.  Someday I will be able to describe the how of it.  I have been taking notes for many years.  Some day my words may be able to speak it... no.  It is not something that language is put to, this grace-filled motion of time and space.  Its a crazy time friends, that we are moving through together.  It is a time that smacks of prophesy and new knowledge, of ultimate hate and compassion, but doesn't every time?  Yes.  But this is the one that we are living in, so it makes a difference to me.  Too much perspective takes the fun out of this game.  And a game it is, don't be fooled.  A complicated game and we are not told all the rules, but are bound to struggle through and all... lose?  Win?  Depends on how you define death I suppose.  I try not to define it, just to keep the pressure on.
