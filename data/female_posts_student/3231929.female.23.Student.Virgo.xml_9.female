Made it in for 9am, spent first two hours with a play specialist before going to a tutorial with a veryfriendly paediatrician.Then it was swiftly on to grand round to consume some free lunch.Then straight afterwardsI headed over to one of the wards for a tutorialwith an SpR, who again turned out to be very friendly andchatty. (I think there's a theme here with paediatricians!)  Everything else is running along OK. One ofmy housemates who's movingout is having a few issues with her new landlord - I'm afraid to say I was polite enough to ask about things then clearly much too tired to actually take in what she was saying; but I'm sure I made the appropriate noises! After a quick trip to the library to photocopy articles for the elective project, I decided to go fill up Percy (my car). With petrol prices at silly levels I headed off to Tesco's thinking this would be relatively cheap at 81.9p per litre. My amusement came as I got out of my car on the forecourt and looked at the pump. It didn't seem to want to work, but I spotted two buttons on it: pay at pump and pay at till. Being a busy place I went for the first option, but as I reached for my credit card, low and behold a knight in shining armour (well, actually a shortish, asian guy in a security outfit) came to help me insert my credit card because these technical details are simply beyond me! He couldn't get the machine to work so poor damsel in distress me had to go into the shop to pay. Don't get me wrong, I, like most women I guess, appreciate a little help from time to time and it's kind of sweet when you get helped simply because you're female, butputting my credit card into a slot and pressing a button?! Heavens, isn't the world a dangerous place for a girl these days! My mind boggles... how did he think I coped at a cashpoint? Gasp! A slot, a series of on screen options and a four figure code to be imputted! It's clearly beyond my XX chromosomes to cope.  Oh yeah, I just changed toe template too. Thought this one looked nicer.
