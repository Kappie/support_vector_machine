I asked her to "interviewificate" me with the five questions game and accidentally emailed her from my spam email address! SO It's been almost a month since she sent me the questions and now I actually got them. Man, what a loser am I.  To make up for it, I shall now plug her site. It is something between a baking blog and a reggaler thoughts one. She is a smart kid and has really cool shoes.  urlLink So go visit it and tell her you think I suck.   Answers shall be posted tomorry.  Signing off, I am stupid. *circle-y finger salute*
