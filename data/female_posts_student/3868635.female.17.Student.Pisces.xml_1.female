If they were, then I probably wouldn't feel so much of a just popped balloon. This past week, I've been flying around like crazy, happy and confident one moment, and lonely and worthless the next. Now, my balloon has landed, deflated and limp on the dirty floor. I guess it has been poked at countless times over the past few years, but now they've all put their strength together, picked up the big needle and with one big prod, have managed to conquer. Right before I leave, I'm sure that we'll have a party or some type of meaningless gathering of the sort where I'll be able to mask what's really going on with drugs and alcohol and I'll feel a little better, but that's not until the last moment, and not before then because then perhaps some people's consciences may nag at them for not doing anything again until that last moment. At least then I'll be however many miles away from it all. They'll be able to form better excuses than "oh, I thought that you were busy." Everyone knows that that excuse is the ultimate bullshit. You had no intention of contacting them, and then you say that with the 50% chance that you'll be right. I am not stupid, I've been on the other side of this for a long time. I suppose Karma has just flipped the tables. What I don't understand is how come just me? Things couldn't be better for everyone else. They're always busy, if not working or with their boyfriends or families, then each other. Me? Well, I tried to go out with Mom, that consisted in looking for stuff that she needed until she got tired. The one night that I got invited out with everyone, they all knew that that was the one night that I had already had plans. It must be bad though, because forever now they'd cleared tonight to try to have a party somewhere. I managed to get the house to myself until midnight or so, with my parents out who don't' mind drinking that much anyways. I'm not going to kid myself, that's all that they wanted to do anyways. They wouldn't even accept that, rather, they didn't acknowledge it and just went off and made their own plans. I suppose they've got something planned for tomorrow night, and Sunday, I'll get home with an email in my inbox from last night at 8pm saying, "Hey Katie! Wow, it's been sooo long! We miss you! That's why you HAVE to come to  > and we'll party! I hope that you haven't left for your aunt's cottage yet, Love, so and so." Ya, bullshit. At 8pm on Saturday night I hadn't yet left for a cottage that I was going to for the weekend. I'd be willing to bet that's what will happen. Unless word doesn't spread that I'm actually going, and then I'll get a call on Sunday night when everyone else getshome from worksaying "Well, it's too bad you work on Sundays because we would have loved your company at the party last night." Didn't stop anyone else! But then again, according to everyone, I don't' actually work anyways. I feel like I'm in some type of Stepford Friends situation. I just don't understand it all. But I suppose I did have it coming. I've had it coming for awhile, and I guess I've dodged it for long enough. Although I'm still pissed off that it was not always at all just me who didn't' want other's to go and I"m being punished. Holy Fuck, I"m selfish. Not that I have anyone else in life to care about. Every one seems so fake and superficial. I just want to know why. Why now? What happened? There are several other times where I could justify all of this, but why now? Oh well, I suppose there's really only 2 more weeks of this. After that, sure I'll be home for another week, but if I really get bored, I'll pay $20 and leave the city and go to MY apartment. Well, mine and Julia's. Only 2 more weeks....
