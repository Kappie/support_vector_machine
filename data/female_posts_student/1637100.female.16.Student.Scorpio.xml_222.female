YESSSSSS go aqua. good timez. hmmmm maybe i should describe ACQUIRE THe FIRE now  friday: were sposed to leave at like 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning, but ended up leaving at like 1:30 coz of various delays. shan had to go to school for a test, mr. soong had to go to work to finish sum'n up, and mrs. soong couldnt find her pasport. we finally left and then stopped over in burger king in aldergrove before crossing the border. we ddrove for like 4 hours straight with a few stops because of daniels car troubles. me and shan had to go to the washroom soooooooo bad coz yeah we were holding it for the entire 4 hours of the ride and in order to keep our minds off our bladders we were like OK. we're gonna learn a song. so we put the discman on repeat on a song called "tarzan and jane" or sum'n like that by AQUA and sang it like 30 times. we must've been so annoying. anyways. we finally got to the tacoma dome [and were able to relieve ourselves.....] and we went for the first lil meeting thing. it was really good. the praise band was alrite.. they had harsh "rocker" voices, but it was alright. the songs ended up lasting like 10 minutes each though. oh yea. grits [the christian rap group] performed a mini concert. they are good, but the volume and especially the bass was too high so you couldnt understand what they were saying sometimes. it was interesting. anyways, after a rather entertaining [not being sarcastic] meeting, we left the tacoma dome, and drove to auntie ritchies house. we got lost or sum'n and then finally got to her house at like 11:30 or sum'n like that. we went to the church to eat dinner, then came back to her house and like 10 of us slept there while a few of the guys slept in the church. the people that came on this trip was the soong family, vanessa, kayel, me, terry, james, malcolm, kaarla, and jay. i rode with shan, and daniel, and vanessa in daniels car. we wen to sleep at like 2:30 or sum'n coz everyone was taking showers and there was only like 1 shower for the 15 of us. well there was 2, but no one wanted to use the upstairs one for various reasons. too much to explain. nutt'n big.  saturday: meeting started at like 8:30, but we all woke up late and ended up arriving at the tacoma dome at like 11:30. anyways, i woke up early and no one else was up. i woke up at like 7:00 and took my sweet time taking a shower and getting dressed etc. it was great. we then ate breakfast, and after a long time, all drove off to the tacoma dome. the speaker on saturday morning was REALLY good. i wish we hadn't come so late, coz he was really on fire, and yeah. after that meeting i saw renan and japhet and then we went and ate sandwiches for lunch, and then went back inside for another meeting after the lil sermon/talk thing, there was a rock concert. the rock bands that were there included trace, kutless, sum'n like to do with the number seven and the word sunday, and some other bands but i cant remember the names. and then after that, we ate dinner and then me, kayel, shan, and malc walked up to meet the fvaa ppl. we chilled with them for a bit and then went back for another meeting. by this time i was soooooooo tired that i fell asleep on the more slow parts of the "sermon" thing. anywyas, after that we left and went back to auntie ritchies house. on the way there we stopped at safeway and i bought an energy drink. i took a shower coz i didnt wanta take one in the morning coz i woudl have to wait forever and stuff likethat. then at like 11:30 we went to the church to eat again. after that, we came back and i was so wide awake coz of the energy drink. so we watched some tv and then i went to sleep at like 2:30.  sunday: woke up around 8:30 or somethign. not sure. everyone was tired and took forever getting dressed etc. finally aroudn 11:30 we ate breakfast/lunch [aka brunch i guess, lol] and then we packed up and drove off to the mall where i found fabulous deals and bought two pairs of shoes for $6 each and a pair of pants that was $20 but it was 60% off so it only cost me $8. after that we said good bye to auntie ritchie and started the long drive home. we arrived back at the soongs house at like 10:15 or so. i finally got home at like 10:45.  yepp. a really good weekend. the speakers at ACQUIRE THE FIRE were really good, the music wasnt bad... and yeah it was fun shopping and stuff. so yeah. thats my weekend. now i have to go do a bit of socials homework/studying and then its time to watch simpsons and king of the hill at 10:00 =D [i have no life!]
