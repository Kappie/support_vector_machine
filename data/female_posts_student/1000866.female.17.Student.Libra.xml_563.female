This is in large part due to the fact that my computer hates my existence and would enjoy terminating it as soon as I fall asleep. I seriously fear going to sleep at night. My computer's just going to attack me one night. I'll be having a dream about guy # 3 (Hah, Carson's the only one who would get this and she doesn't even know the address to this thing. Nonetheless; henceforth, I think I shall refer to him as, "guy # 3." Actually, no...I take that back. I hate finding the number sign on the top row of keys so I'll just refer to him as "Numero Three." So, yeah...anyywwayyyy....moving on...this was the longest set of parentheses I've ever had. Did you even notice I'm still writing in parentheses? Read up a few lines if you need to figure out what I started before the parentheses and then go straight to the end of the parentheses. Hah. That was most enjoyable) and my computer will just attack me and then it'll be goodbye Numero Three and I'll cry. Ah, Numero Three....ahhh. :)   Yes, anyway. It was AMAZING!!! I got a 125 in bowling today. I started out with two gutter balls too. I was like, oh no! Another awful game...but it wasn't! YaY! Hm, Wind Ensemble's good too. We played the beef song. I love that song. It's amazing. It's challenging though. I admit it. A band song is challenging.  Math was cool. I just worked on finishing my packet the whole period. I didn't turn in some crap though so I only have a 90.15%. Heh. Whoops. I'll have to do well on my final then.   Gym...I already talked about so that's cool. French was good. I'm totally going to ace that test. (I hope.) It'll be fun times. Those are my two finals for Tuesday. Gym and French. YaY! :)   Lunch was good. Carson and I talked about the plan. That was good. I need a plan too for Numero Three. Definitely need a plan.   Hah. Drivers Ed./Study hall, I went to the band room like usual and they had a sub and she was SO mean. Like...seriously just the biggest B-I-T         -T-E-R W-O-M-A-N I've ever met. Haha. You were expecting me to spell something different, weren't you? I've been sticking to my non-swearing thing although it's been incredibly difficult. Anyway, she wasn't nice at all so a bunch of us just hid in the music library. That was cool. :) Brandon and Alex climbed in the ceiling. Hah. Those two are crazy.   History was boring boring borrrinnggg. I made up the test that I had to make up from a looong time ago. Like...a month ago at least. Heh.   Then Satire and Comedy, ohh...it made me sad. I love ms. Gatto. She's the coolest. Our ms. Gatto fan club got her flowers this morning! Haha. She was so happy. She jumped up and down and stuff. YaY! I'm really going to miss that class though. I really enjoyed it.   And tonight, I think I'm going to stay at home and watch the Disney Channel movie that I wanted to watch. Heh...heh...I'm not a loser...no...  Tomorrow I'll find something to do. I need to do stuff with Kelly, Kathryn, and Mary Clare and with Peter and Chris is gone. :( That makes me sad. So is Brandon. Two of my good friends are out of town. This is disturbing. Oh well.   And it was amazing. I had grilled cheese for dinner. It was SOOOO delicious. Yum yum yum. YaY for grilled cheese.   And now off to watch my Disney movie and look at my books sitting next to me and think, "I should really study but I'm too lazy."  Oh, oh, oh! (Herbal Essences anyone?) I remembered something else too! Alex copied me the Till Bronner CD! YAY!!! I was so excited. :) So, now I have Till and my Disney movie and my book tha wont be opened. I've got my Friday night made.
