I really am desireous of a pair of tall Ugg boots, even though these are terribly faddish and trendy. I want all things designer, but I can't abide by paying full price, and further, I don't have the kind of disposable income to buy all of those sorts of things; I also cannot allow myself to incure debt that isn't for my education. So, I think my goal when I "grow up," is to own a house with a hot tub, and be able to by select designer pieces to augment my discount wardrobe. Right now my wardrobe is almost entirely discount, which should be what a college student should have, but this is not in line with the current styles at my school. I tell myself this: girls who wear designer clothes are either rich, in which case I am both envious of their wealth and sneering since they go to state school, or they, or their parents, are deeply in debt to afford such an expensive habit. It gets me through my day, and makes me feel better about myself. It's good for my ego to feel superior.
