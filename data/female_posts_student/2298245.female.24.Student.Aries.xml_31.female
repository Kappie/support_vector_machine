The day after was a nice adventure as well:  shopping, waiting in Wendy's for over 30 minutes for service because of computer problems - this is why, incidentially, even though computers grow in importance nearly by the second, computers will never take over the world - and seeing the new, and last, installment of Lord of the Rings.  It was good, but I'd still say The Two Towers was the best one.
