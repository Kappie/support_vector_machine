So Luke was left 2 hav coffee bi himself. Han and KC joined us 4 'bout 10 mins, then had 2 go home. Han kept on giving very unsubtle hints, and Bianca... ok maybe I should stop here. Neway, it was nice. :D Good talk, good company. The 45 mins went quite quickly and b4 long we were walking back towards Mimosa and Davo and the bus stop, 'cept Luke had 2 run 4 the bus. Hope I didnt' make him miss it. Oops. I had 2 detour 2 pick up mi little bro. I'm glad we finally got sum time 2 talk (bi the way I'm talking bout Luke not mi bro - i get too much time with him!) outside of all the technological communication devices. :) We should do it more often. Fun Fun. Blogging off, Beth  p.s we hav sold our first Speedo Joel merchandise! :D Luke's long john's. haha, they r the funniest thing u could possibly eva see!
