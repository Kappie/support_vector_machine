The last game I went to was a Vikings game. It went into overtime and we lost, just like we did tonite. My very first Bruins game, and a decisive one. We had that fucker in the bag, and guess what? Franklin pulled some shit in nine seconds. Everyone around me was saying, "Hell no, Franklin will never do it."   They missed the extra point, we got the ball first in OT. We were killed in the field goal, and then they kicked one and got it...their very first one of the night.  Everyone was clearly defined, teamwise, after the game. I was the one standing way up top giving Franklin the bird.   On the way out tho...I had calmed a bit. I was still fucking pissed off...hell, I still am. But I was cooling down, driving by the buses, giving the Franklin bandies the "evil eye", which they returned and being pretty amicable, in general. And then, one of the buses starts up the chant, "Bend over, Brentwood."  Fuck, I dunno why, but that was the shortest straw. I think it's just the fact that they're a bunch of redneck assholes. Maybe some latent fear of being anally raped?!? But all the same, the window was down, and I made clear my feelings on that with a mid-based finger. Someone yelled, "Franklin rules!" to which I yelled...something not very nice. I made up a lot of things too. I must give myself one thing, if not a lot of things: I am a proficient swearer. Tonite became the advent of so many interesting phrases, I could do verbal battle with a sailor and pwn his @zz.  So. I'm going to bed. Today was a really bad frickin' day, because it was raining. I ate lots of chocolate, but I guess the seratonin pumps decided not to work. David Stanley also made some pretty fucking horrible comments today about Abby...I'm playing football at his house on Monday. Rest assured he's going to fucking  die . I don't care if he's not being serious. There was a line, and he crossed it. And that was just further depressing, and more than just a bit angering. Like...I spontaneously combusticated because of the intense anger.  People on fire are funny.  Irrelevently yours.
