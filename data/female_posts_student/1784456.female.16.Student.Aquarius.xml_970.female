Apart from getting a bit obsessed with FFIX again ...hehe... (not good) So don't expect me to come out of my house for a few days... no wait, I'm trying to cover every thing on it... make that years. Hehe... I'm just enjoying my freedom while I still can! (Yes... freedom *muhahaha*) Hey! Give me back my third head! (It's mine too you fool) Hehe, I love that word. Fool. Lol. I'm weird. Ehe... any way... trying to distract attention from that... err... yeay Halloween! Wow, isn't it sooo cool? It's like a total way for card companies to get money through a pagin *whatever* festival! Every one go "yeay that's soooo great!" (No.) Aww, you big meanie!  urlLink http://www.benjerry.com/halloween/  Yeay... let's all celebrate. But seriously. Some people are all 'churchy' then they go and celebrate Halloween... weird huh? Probably not, but I think it is!
