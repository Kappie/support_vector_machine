This saturday, my nieces and nephew will have their joint birthday celebration...these past few days have been hectic...no chance to chat, to time to scan...pure adrenaline rush in school and at home...then, there's work pressure...  I can't say that it's nice to be back...but i do love the welcome relief of getting pressured once again...kinda helped me in going to sleep...too tired to think.
