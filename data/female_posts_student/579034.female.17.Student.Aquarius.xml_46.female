The busride up was a great time (we read about finding your G-spot) and then when we go to the park we went for a little test run on the course. Then we played around at the park for a while. We did like a sequence on my video camera where all the girls were like doin carwheels and stuff, then me and Duff had a mock fight. James somewhat molested Carolin on camera when she was talkin, we took pictures of all of us by the big sign thing. Then we went to the hotel and got ready to go out to dinner and the arcade. I went on the go-karts with everyone and a bunch of people we didn't know. I beat everyone except this one kid but I past all the rest. Then a bunch of us went on this like "Haunted" walk through thing. It was only scary cause like people jumped out at you and stuff and I almost broke Vin's hand. Sorry about that. lol. So, then Deb and I whipped Vin at this driving game. Oh yea, and our room had no electricity so we were like in the dark and had to use other peoples like hair dryers and stuff. So when we got  back to our rooms we had like a little meeting with coach and we tried to get our room switched but there werent any extras so we hadda stick it out. It was okay though. We hung out and ate ice cause we had nothing to drink and we ate a little candy. We plugged the radio into the bathroom cause that was the only part of the room that had power and then like, just as we were fallin asleep there was a little pop and the lights came on. It was so scary I like jumped a foot in the air lol. So, then the next day, we woke up (dah) and then we ate a little breakfast, read the newspaper (lol) and hopped on the bus to the park. Kersha is very comfy when your heads not on his noisy stomach (lol). So, then, we got to the park and set up the tent. The frehsman girls went off first, then the Jv, and then the Varsity. I PRd!! I think almost everyone did. I ran 22:40 I think, somewhere in that area. So then the rest of the day we played around. A bunch of us did the electric slide (I got it on tape) and then I listend to some of the Notre Dame game, but turned it off and then I found out later they lost 42-14. Very very very not cool. BC next week so... I should start praying now. So, then we had the busride home which was barrels of laughs. I slept, or tired to sleep through most of it, then we were home and then that was it. Brown 2003 was over (breaks into hystercal crying fit). It was so much fun. I love our team. Everyone is just so like, awesome. All of them. Like, in our room, we were talkin about how great everyone is, and like we were naming the best outta them and we named like everyone. I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!! Okay, thats enough emotional stuff. Now, to Homework. BLAH!!! x0x
