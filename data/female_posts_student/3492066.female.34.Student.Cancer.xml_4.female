I should have gotten up later. Already it's afternoon and I'm finally feeling awake even after a 32 oz. Rooster Booster Lite (taurine, guanine, but no caffine) at 9 a.m.. Now that I'm hearing the footsteps of my possible future mother-in-law upstairs, I think perhaps it's time I go wake someone up from his brief nap so we can get back to work. I want to get the organization of the garage done and his room cleaned out before my sanity breaks or I go batty hearing his mother complain just one more time.
