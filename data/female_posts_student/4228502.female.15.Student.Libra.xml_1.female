But I have seen a perfect ten. Actually I met a perfect ten, yes a real person so beautiful in every way that they could not be considered anything less than a ten. I could have reached out and touched this person if I had wanted to. Can't stop thinking about him, not sure what it is...but he was a dream come true. (I lie, the people in my dreams couldn't even compare)
