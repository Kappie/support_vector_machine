Dead tiring and super boring. And we had to be there for 8 full hours.   There seemed to be an influx of ah bengs, spikey haired guys in black clothes and every guy in Klang lah, was there. Crazy man. Convent is such a guy magnet. Hah hah. Anyway, I am just so so so glad its o v e r.   Planning and organizing isn’t my expertise and I really did it bad for my class. Poor girls. All our bones were aching by 11am (it ended at 3pm), at least the weather was hot and sunny. Now I’ll probly switch to full-blast study mode. Haha, very funny Mary-Ruth. That would never happen in a thousand years.   A lot of things have been happening lately you know. I’ve a few things on my mind now:  1. My brother came back for a whole week and then he left 3 days ago. I really miss him around. He’ll only be back in 2 months time.   2. PMR trials are around the corner. Enough said.   3. Playing keyboards for youth. I don’t feel like its my gift. Serious. But I can’t stop now cause I know that my youth leader will say ‘I don’t think it’s my gift’ is nonsense. Sigh, I can just imagine his response. Ah yes, and they are lacking keyboardists and are currently training me up for Sunday service. I know it. AHHHHHH how now how now?  -more on that later, not now, brain bursting-   4. The MPH Young Writers competition. Deadline is next Saturday I haven’t written anything. I don’t think can make it liao. Sigh. Eh, actually I did write a paragraph but I don’t like it. My mom accidentally read it and said it was good but I don’t think so. Sigh sigh sigh. Will I ever make it as a writer?
