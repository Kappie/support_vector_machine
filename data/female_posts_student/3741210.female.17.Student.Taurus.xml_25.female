He said to come back at 12:30 and we would eat then but he's stuck in a phone meeting with some guy.  He's actually right in the office next to this so I can hear them talking.  If he stays too late we won't be able to go to the park for lunch.  Its really lonely when you have no one to talk to at lunch time.  Today I went to a seminar on what exactly title insurance is. It was ok, ate up all of my morning.  Last night I hung out with the clan.  We always go to the Meadow Glens parking lot to meet, and from there we went to caribou. I got a free cup of coffee because Tom ordered it without whip cream and they put it on, so they made another one and they gave us that one for free.  Then we went back to the parking lot where we met up with Jeremy who had just got back from work and we test drove his mini-van and Amits.  I had never driven a van so it was good times.   Jer told us there was homicide near our house.  A few weeks ago we had seen this house that had yellow tape all over it and like 10 cop cars and we asked what was going on but they wouldn't tell us.  Jer's Mom works for the police dept. And that's how she found out what really went down.  Apparently the victim was found half-naked in a pool of blood, curiously enough she was found by the ex-husband who called the cops.  Hmmm ...That doesn't look incriminating.    My dad still isn't back.  Its now 12:49. I'm going to finish my lunch.  Well hope all you guys out there are finding life enjoyable. Au revior.
