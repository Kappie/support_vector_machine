Sitting through the same service twice in a row is not exactly my idea of fun, but oh well. After church, I stayed home and watched Andy Roddick lose to Roger Federer at Wimbledon. Tear :*(. Moving right along, I played tennis today for two and a half hours, too, and that was great fun. I swear I'm going to get skin cancer as a result of too much sun exposure this summer. Anyways, my dad went out to buy a new racquet, and this thing apparently features something called "Power Bulge Technology." I think I have some of that in my stomach region :). Oh yes - and things did not go as planned today, mainly because it would have had to do with burning blue hand rinse solution. Ahem. I won't go into detail :P. Instead, I went to the fireworks at the high school with Dan and David, and we met Steph, Jayne, and Poawtah there. I swear Dan and I are going to take over music duties for the show next year :P. And that's the story of my long day.     Last song I listened to:   Chemistry  by Semisonic.   Last album I listened to:   One For The Kids .   Last meal I ate:  Fried chicken, macaroni salad, root beer.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . I must see  Spidey !   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  All the band nerds started singing "Sing, Sing, Sing" and "Thriller" at the fireworks. It didn't last very long, however :P.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I looked up the densities of various gases. Propane is heavier than air. Congratulations; you learned something today. Oh yes... I also listened to the chemistry song a few times.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   Rough Draft  by Yellowcard.   Favorite food today:  Does fruit punch count as a food?   Most interesting thing I did today:  I beat my dad in a short set, 3 games to 1 :).   Funniest thing that happened today:  Hmm... Jayne got up and performed an interpretive dance for us at the fireworks. That was amusing. And the tennis racquet with the "Power Bulge;" that is good stuff.
