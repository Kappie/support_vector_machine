The fourth year exams are done .. but i think in my case, they are not over with. I have this bad bad feeling that i am gonna have to do the re-sits in November. Especially after the written paper on wednesday. Omigod. THAT was difficult. A whole CRQ question on SPASMODIC TORTICOLLIS. im not exactly complaining about this particular question because i could answer it ( lucky me .. cos i just read about the condition for my own personal interest and not for the exams). But just the fact that dystonias arent supposed to be favourite exam topics. Oh .. we also got a whole CRQ question on GIARDIASIS .. omigod. Traveller's diarrhoea. Giler susah the written exams.. the EMI's were even tougher. One whole page was dedicated to family trees and matching them with the appropriate hereditary conditions. That was AWFUL. i mean sure i know whether the common hereditary conditions such as duchenne's muscular dystrophy is x-linked  recessive etcetera.. but to figure out which family tree best describes the condition. aiyoh.   The OSCE's yesterday .. alhamdulillah was not as bad. It was still hard but i didnt feel as bad as i did when i left the exam hall after the written. As a matter of fact, i think i kinda thought this OSCE was FUN! probably because most of the manned stations were manned by 'nice' doctors. The consultant i had for my portfolio station.. haha.. everyone in my group were hoping that they would not get her.. including yours truly. But she turned out to be quite nice and did not give me such a hard time for that station. Im glad i chose to type out the front sheets for my case write-ups, instead of doing them by hand ;first impressions count. Surprisingly some of the examiners were rather 'relaxed' .. during the ALS STATION which i finish way before the 4 mins, the examiner asked me where i was heading for my electives .. and whether i have brothers or sisters blabalbala... i remember this question cos as i was making use of the extra time to answer the rest of the empty boxes in my answer book, i managed to tell him that i had a brother doing first year medicine in edinburgh. In the fundoscopy station.. hahahah.. i missed out the letter next to the optic disc in the dummy's eye.. but the nice examiner asked me .. dont u see a letter? i probably didnt notice it cos i was too busy trying to decribe the disc. I said i did .. and then he asked me to look for another letter.. in the macular area. Afterall that, he asked me whether i was going back to KL!!!!! ( actually the moment i entered the room, he asked me, ' are you MALAYSIAN?')  I promptly replied.. 'sarawak!'.. well if he knows KL, he should know SARAWAK !!!!!!!   arrghhh .. EXAMS EXAMS. because the first run had started late , the second run ( i was in the second run) started like half an hour late. omigod.. the delay was pure torment. I remember feeling really really sick and nauseated as we waited outside Clinical Skills. And, i thought to myself.. God, i dont want to go through all this again. Pure torture. But i guess thats just the effect of the adrenaline rush ... cos after the OSCE's, i thought, hey that was fun! But boy .. was i drained!!!!!!! bY the way, i would like to acknowlege my utmost appreciation to my dear fren zak who went thru the CVS exam ( plus all the other exams ) the night before the osce;s. Thank god we revised the full CVS exams including all those manouvres for murmurs. And thank goodness u reminded me to use the bell of the stethoscope as well. There is definitely a mark for THAT cos i saw Dr Pringle mark on his sheet when i did it.   okies. re-sits or no re-sits i still have to go home. have to do the electives. strangely, for the first time in my 4 years here, i am not all that excited about going home. probably cos i know i did terribly badly ( redundancy intented) in the exams ...   oh well.. im gonna be seeing my dear golliwog next week. *sigh* i really feel i dont deserve this holiday at all ....
