And days off from work are not to be taken lightly. I wish adventure would come knocking on my door. Isn't is sad to think of people who waste their lives at an office? Sitting at a computer day in and day out with nothing to look forward to. I think thats the scariest thing. To come to the end and realize your life meant nothing, and that your time was wasted. I hope to God that doesn't happen to me.
