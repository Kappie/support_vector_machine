I talked to a lot of them but I'm only really even considering like 1 or 2 of the schools I talked to. My thing is, if things don't work out with De Paul, La Salle doesmn't seem too bad. I won't get into Fordham but, La Salle I could do. And Pennsylvania is far away enough. Chicago would be better though. I'm kinda overwhelmed by all this college stuff actually. Like, there is just so much involved in the whole process ya know? Like, the SATs, the ACTs, the SAT II's, the application, the personal statement, the money, the deadlines, the teacher reccomendations... its just enough to turn your head ya know? But... yeah... today was my last CCD class. I really wanna teach next year but I don't think they are gonna let me. Some of the kids in my class said they wanted me to teach 5th grade (I'm in 4th this year) so they can have me as a teacher. Made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. x0x
