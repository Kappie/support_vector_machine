I go back to Hillsboro tomorrow around 7pm, I really don't want to but my cat, Carmen, is being declawed and I have to take care of her while moms at work. Hopefully I'll come back to dads sunday or monday and say awhile. Being here helps pass time faster untill we move out from John, when I'm there I'm always all sad and depressed but here I'm like WOO lol. I'm really nervous about school starting again, so much about me and about my friends has changed to much over the summer.   Like, Melissa (cheese)  getting a job even though today was her first day its still weird because its one of the steps in her life being "all grown up" lol. I am no where near as shy as I was when school let out, I have some people to thank for that.  It's so weird to think that in three years I'll be out of school and going off to collage somewhere, hopefully NYU or UC.  Frankly, I am so terrified about not being able cope with whats to come in the next chapters of my life, but I am gratefull for all my friends because I know that they will always be there me, and thats really comforting.  Dude my friends are so awesome, they're so random and funny. But I'm goin go, cause all this mushy stuff is gettin to me.
