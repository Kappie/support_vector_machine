(answer is in relation to the variable  h  ex. 6 h )  Does anyone know??? It's driving me crazy!!!!!  So i took the PSAT this morning... I think i prolly did better than last year... although I still didn't study a whole lot either.  Then Kayla and i went to the mall an cruised the formal dresses for a while.  And now i sit here... kinda bored... kinda tired... but hey... minimal homework this week (clap clap clap).  So... now I have zilch to do.  I have realized a not-so-encouraging pattern in my life... and have found it's kinda a problem.   Ask me about it if you wish, otherwise I'll keep my mouth shut.    So... turn off the lights, and close the doork, that's all there is... there isn't anymore.
