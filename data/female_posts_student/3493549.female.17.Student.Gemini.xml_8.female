I somehow expected more since everyone's been going on about it and there's all this hype about it. Moreover, the first installment was rockin'. Oh well.  Anyway, I was there at 1u with WK and Jay and it wasn't a really fun afternoon anyway. I mean, I didn't really wanna go out with WK but since he kept asking and asking, I thought I might just go out with him once and then maybe he'll stop asking. It's pretty weird with him now cuz though he knows that I don't like him and doubt I'll ever do, he acts so indifferent and is still hanging around everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for being just friends but at times I feel he's just too much. Perhaps even crossing certain boundaries, if I must say so myself. He still sends me home everyday, and I do get afraid sometimes cuz he's such an emotional person and I can't read his mind and dunno what he's thinking. So, I do get scared in the car when he gets angry and loses control. Freaky? On the other hand, I think he's a sweet guy though, I really do. I mean, he's probably the most caring friend I have. Is there such a thing as being overcaring? That's how i feel he is sometimes, which can be a little bit annoying.  Anyway, I am glad Jay came along cuz he kept WK busy talking and I just had to act discreet and keep quiet. We had lunch at 3:30 at Waffle World which is a yummy place to eat. I lurve that place, though I am getting a teensy weensy bit tired of waffles and pancakes. Lol.   While I was queuing up for tickets for SHrek, I managed to snag 3 tickets for today's Harry Potter premiere. You wouldn't believe the queue and the amount of people there. They looked like ants lining up for sugar blocks or something. I just stood in the line for an hour and by then I was already exhausted. Yeah, standing up and moving once in a while is soo tiring. No, actually, I don't fancy being stuck in crowds stuffy and suffocated. It makes me really irritated and I'll snap at you...j/k.   I was all geared up for a party (not really) today. Harry Potter only comes to town once a year right? I really looked forward to today's show and  *sigh*  once more, I was let down. It makes me wonder if I'm losing the thrill for movies. Now, Harry Potter wasn't bad or terrible but it wasn't good either. This is the third HP movie and I guess it's true what  Simon Cowell  said about third installments - they are usually not brilliant and just no good. Well, I agree with Simon. Perhaps I had too high expectations cuz I really thought this will be good. After all, the first two were pretty good and it can only get better right? I'll tell you what went wrong here. It was too  boring . I did not feel the suspense or the intensity as was evident in The Philosopher's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets. This was like a kid show. Everything was so basic and simple. The acting was good although I have to mention that the 'new'  Dumbledore  just didn't live up to the billing. If I must say, in this movie, Dumbledore was  cheesy . If I am not mistaken, it's not Richard Harris in the part of the principal of Hogwarts since he passed on last year. Well, hats off to him; he's greatly missed. He's not the only part changed I hear. Peter Jackson (is that his name?) has been replaced too, by some Mexican fella, I think. That's what went wrong. You can't just change directors like that, especially not for a multimillion bucks project as famous as Harry Potter. Everyone's gonna have expectations and you either live up to these expectations or you crash big time. I vote for crash boom bang this time.  I just don't get why he has to be replaced. I wasn't following this in the media so I have no idea what exactly what went on. But I am  sad . I really hope the Goblet of Fire will be good and go back to its former HP glory.   Anywayz, after the movie, Ken and Jay were disappointed too. We went to Secret Recipe and Ken paid for the whole meal. I felt really guilty and like, something's not right. I was insisting that we pay our share but he will not hear of it, so I did not get up from my seat. Ha-ha. I was like "No I'm not gonna budge." so he came over and tried to pull me out of the chair but of course I was being stubborn. I just didn't want him to waste his money although he's being such a gentleman. So in the end, we struck a  deal . Next week, the meal is on me and I hope he doesn't forget it. I feel sorry for Ken as he had to pay for Jay - he has such a ferocious appetite and eats twice as much as the next person *sigh*
