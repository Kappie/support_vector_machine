Pictured above is the Aliph Jawbone which lets you talk in noisy spots like restaurants by suppressing surrounding noise. It was created for military use but will also help you become a marginally less rude diner by letting you speak, not shout, while your tablemates try hard not to listen.    My favorite winner is the Knirps XI, the world's smallest umbrella, which can resist winds up to 50 MPH and is extra fast-drying.
