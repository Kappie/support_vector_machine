That's right, folks, in my zeal to recover from the bug I fought all week, I drank too much and ended up (allegedly) being the life of a Mexican wedding reception.  To which I was not invited.  I'm sure everyone is shocked, just shocked, that I would behave in such a way, but I have to say that the parts of the night that I remember are really entertaining.  Those would include:  Losing $16 at the horse races, and winning back $3.20, my first-ever pony purse.  Drinking lots of $1 beer at said horse races.    Relieving myself in the bushes outside of Pappadeaux, because it just seemed too far to walk inside like a civilized person.  At this point it is still daylight.  Getting cut off at Pappadeaux, and then trying to sneak a bottle of wine that I procured at the bar back to our table, like a 17-year-old spiking the punch at prom.  It didn't work; our manager was more clever than he appeared.  I think I asked our waiter for his phone number.    Wisely deciding that we should not leave the Holiday Inn to continue our debauchery; luckily, there was an enormous wedding as well as a class reunion in the hotel.  After cheap beer at the races and expensive wine at dinner (though not the quantity I would have liked), the only reasonable thing to do was drink massive amounts of Alabama Slammers, which contain mainly Southern Comfort and something pink.    At this point, things are a little fuzzy.  I do remember asking for nachos, being told that they were out of nachos, but here, have another Slammer instead!  Thanks, Tony.    I remember arguing about what  urlLink ceviche  meant (I was right), telling everyone that I wanted to sleep with Charlize Theron, and successfully dancing to Amarillo by Morning.    Rumor has it that, after all of this excitement, I also tried to out-salsa the reception attendees and managed to fall on my ass no less than four times, to the delight of everyone in the bar.  Needless to say, I will not be darkening the door of the Holiday Inn in Grand Prairie anytime soon.  My next clear memory is waking up about 9 with an intense desire to empty my stomach.   Alabama Slammers are not as tasty the second time around, guys.  And this is the not the first time they have worked their evil magic on my digestive system.  You think I'd learn my lesson...
