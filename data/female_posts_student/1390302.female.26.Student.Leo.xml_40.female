Last season, 2002 when the Tampa Bay Buc’s won the Super bowl and became the world champions!!!  My team, how I beam with pride at their victory!  I look back to the beginning of the year, back to the very first game they played and remember saying –when my husband asked me who I thought would win the Super bowl that year- “Tampa Bay, baby!! Tampa Bay’s a sure thing” to which he replied, “I don’t know, you say that every year and they haven’t come thorough for you yet!”    Now I say, “Told ya so, I told ya so!”  It was a day like no other for me as a rooted my team onto victory!  The smartest move they ever made was picking up Jon Gruden as they coach and dumping Tony Dungee.  Now don’t get me wrong, as a fan of the Buc’s I wasn’t all too pleased when they kicked Tony to the curb, but I can’t ignore the fact that they won the world championship the very first season that Gruden was with them.  It definitely helps that Jon Gruden has always been my favorite football coach, even though he was the coach of a team I hate, the Oakland Raiders.  Okay, so now that my favorite team won the highest prize in football, the Lombardi trophy.  I look at them now, trying to decide if I would choose them for another year of football victory and I have to say they definitely make the cut, except for one minor indiscretion, Chris Simms!  Chris Simms is a stuffed up prick riding on his father’s coattail.  He’s no where near as good as he should be, can’t hold a candle to Major Applewhite, and his father was never anything worth looking at twice either.  For a man who thinks so damned much of himself, Chris Simms is second rate, just like his old man!  All rants aside, they still harbor my favorite Defensive Tackle in the League, Warren Sapp.  Yet I wonder if that’s enough now.  With the loss of Warrick Dunn, big mistake, I think I am going to aim my good luck cheers in another direction this season, yet where, I am not quite sure.    I have wondered if the Dallas Cowboys have what it takes to perk my interest this year, now that they dumped most of their dead weight –Dave Campos. They picked up some fresh blood Bill Parcels –who is most likely appreciated in Dallas but not in New York, as we saw when Jeremy Shockey called him a “homo.”    I so love the shit talkers of football! So I doubt that I will be watching much of the Cowboys this year, while I live in Texas, I can’t help looking and seeing them as a disappointment!  I think that I may root for the Colts this year, I do so enjoy watching Payton Manning.  Still, I am not sure they perk my interest… so as it stands, I am yet with out a team to root for, yet with out a team that excites me, yet with out a team to be my heart and soul for the 2003 year!  Still, when I finally come to the end of my long search –which I hope will be soon- I shall let you know who I have chosen to be “my team” this year.  ~Kristyn
