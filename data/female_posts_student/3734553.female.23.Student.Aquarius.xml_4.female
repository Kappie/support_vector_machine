At first I thought I would make a black book just for you, and keep track of everything that way.  But just by looking at that you wouldn't know what was really going on, because those are so vague I would have to be there to explain everything.  Not only that, but they are so personal who knows if I would be able to part with it when the time came.  so then I was going to keep a book and just write all my letters to you in that.  But after talking to a friend, I decided to do this because I will be more likely to write everything and more often than I would otherwise.  I've grown up writing on the computer and this is just easiest.  I hope you don't think it seems more impersonal.  So, this is whats been going on with me... The week before I left Austin, I got my tattoo. Vade Mecum in white on the inside of my left wrist.  Now that it is healed you would barely notice it.  I walk around all the time without my watch on and my parents still haven't noticed it. I really like it. Maybe in a few years after I have been out of law school for a while I will go over it in a color.  you never know-  I am going to the Simon and Garfunkel concert with Jamey next week.  He is the guy I wrote to you about, the guy from work in Austin.  We hang out every once-in-a-while.  He went through a messy breakup and we have bonded over similar situations.  Had we met at another place another time he would have been the type of guy I would be interested in.  But I'm glad I got to know him when I did because he has become another good friend.  Almost another Krysten for me.  So I'm tired and going to bed now... I had intended to write more about that e-mail you sent, but maybe I will later, i think I'm kinda over it now.  I just don't believe that you don't have feelings for me.
