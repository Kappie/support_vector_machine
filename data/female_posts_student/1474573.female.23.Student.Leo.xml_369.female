It seems that a nerd is on the top tier.  Nerds understand more, create more and are generally just smarter.  Geeks are a step below them.  Geeks love gadgets and gaming and such, but don't have quite the capacity to actually CREATE much of the games and stuff that they play with.  Dorks are smart, but lack a certain amount of tact or hmm... je ne c'est pas.    Perhaps I'm too close to it to truly understand what constitutes a dork.  Basically because I  AM  a dork.  Many of my friends call me that on a regular basis.  I think it has something to do with my goofy sense of humor, my weirdness about certain things in general and well, I don't really know what else.  Hopefully someone can explain it in the comments section below.  (hehehe)  It's okay.  I'm okay with it.  I'm relatively good natured about it.  I know that being a dork isn't necessarily a BAD thing...and neither is being a nerd or geek.  While chatting further this morning, my friend (a nerd) and I realized that, like in Dungeons and Dragons, people can be half something and half the other.  Sorta like a dark elf mixed with a human... or um... something.  Also, there are nerds that possess a jocky side (a 'nock', if you will) and some that have a very goofy side (let's just call them 'Rich Villar', shall we?)   Oh, and there are many nerds and geeks who don't embrace their nerdiness, but would be much better off if they did.  Or at least would feel so much better about life in general.  I mean, how great would it be to know and understand that you are more intelligent than most?!  I'm sure I'd enjoy that immensely, however, I will never know that feeling because I am just a lowly dork.  My husband is a strange one.  He is almost uncatergorizable.  He is very clever, funny, somewhat popular, not too sloppy, and is pretty darn smart. He also LOVES sports, listens to classic rock, plays golf for cryin' out loud, but also has a healthy obsession with all things X-Box, loves comic books and D  So, what the heck is he, you ask?  Well according to a good source, because he loves AC/DC and Led Zepplin, that makes him a metal-head.  Metal heads have a very nerdy side to them, don'chaknow.  Sometimes, they'll scare you with the shit they come out with, especially with role playing and perceptiveness.  So go figure.  But back to me now... I used to read some of my brother's comic books when I was younger, I used to ride a plastic skateboard that I bought in Toys R Us in the house back and forth and back and forth... I went to Bronx Science, I got pretty good grades until Junior Year when all hell broke loose.  I left my mother's house to live with my dad when I was 15.  I lost my virginity to my serious boyfriend at 16 (do as I say, not as I do, kids!) and I used to f'in live for Duran Duran, Wham/George Michael (still do), Slaughter, Nelson and yes, I even liked the New Kids for a while there.    Nowadays - confession - When I clean the house, I listen to Wham's  Music From the Edge of Heaven  full blast and sing along to songs like Wham RAP and Young Guns (Go for it!).  Actually, I sing to a lot...almost EVERY song on the radio.  I'm obsessed with the entertainment business and star gossip, I married a metal head, and I obsess about my best friend's relationship because I need more drama in my life (actually I'm a control freak and I love her but don't tell HER that) ...have I forgotten anything?  I dont think so.  Basically I obsess A LOT.  So tell me... what do you think I am?  And while you're at it categorize yourself and give examples why.  I'm curious to know what everyone thinks.  You can also be something other than dork, geek or nerd.  You could be a freak or a slut, etc... I'll tell you later whether I agree or not.  Thank you and good night.  :-)
