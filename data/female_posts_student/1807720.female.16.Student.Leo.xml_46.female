To my sister and her fiancé They claim high school is just a joke And reassure me University is where it really starts But I am just so confused right now  Right now everything seems so hard I have no clue of how I will make it through I don’t understand just why things just are And I wish I new why I just don’t seem to get things  Feeling as if though the teachers judge and stare It is like they feel that I am not smart enough Or just something enough, I am lacking something I just don’t know what it is right now  But I was always told to follow my heart And that is what I feel I must do right now But sometimes it’s hard to follow my true feelings Because I know what I want to do and where I want to go  However, I want to teach science, maybe Bio But I need chem. 30 and well 20 is hard And well Physics I can’t really predict how I will do I have to be good at Bio next term I just have too!  If I am not good at Bio, or Physics, or Chem. then how the hell can dreams come true? How can I have a job that I love or pass University? In life what purpose would I serve?  There are so many questions, but not enough answers I wish someone could just tell me my future Cause sometimes I wonder why I am here?  What can I do? I feel as though my efforts just pour down a drain  It feels like I try and I try and I TRY But that is never enough it seems The one thing I want more than anything in this world Is to just understand for once, and have my efforts recognized  And sometimes I think no one really does know ALL the hours I spend studying or doing homework ALL the days and nights I try to figure out Chem. ALL the times I just practice my math over and over  Just hoping that maybe I will get a good mark Maybe all my studying will pay off, but does it? A lot of times I just feel and wonder why do I waste this time studying? I work so hard, but never get to where I want to be  It is always like that, but why does it have to be? I don’t choose to be dumb and all I want to be smart But I feel dumb because I never understand what everyone else does And it is so FRUSTRATING almost all of the time  But no one can make me smart, or make me understand If I could make myself understand I certainly would And I KNOW that it is not from lack of effort Because there is so much effort I put into everything I do  So really I have to explanation to why things are the way they are Certainly an explanation would be nice And maybe I will reach my goals, and live my dreams But I just don’t know right now cause I am so confused about everything  Chelsey and I always seem to argue almost all the time We still have fun together but things are changing now, people are changing And it is hard to talk to her about the things that bother me There is no one really there anymore because she was the only one  I wish sometimes I could just talk to people openly about anything But that is not the way things work even though I wish it were true And I feel as if the ONLY person to care enough about anything is Mrs. J I always felt she cared more than anyone I have ever met  But my mother always calls me annoying, and she might possibly think the same And I don’t think she would want to hear my problems I mean when I think about it there is nothing I can do or anyone else No one can make me smart, or make me understand  It’s like I am stuck in the middle of some feeling so awful To feel like I am never successful at anything And to feel like I never achieve anything that I feel I deserve It is a very heart crushing feeling because I try really hard  And the feeling of love WAS something I thought was great Until I woke up and snapped out of this daze I WAS in I thought I liked Alex but I realize now I can’t stand anything about him and he is not my type  He is the kind that keeps things to himself, but I myself am more extroverted And well I CAN’T stand those army shorts, and army pants They drive me INSANE cause he is obsessed with anything army And I don’t want to upset him but I really don’t like him how I thought I did  That feeling inside of me is a feeling of love But that strong feeling is developing for Travis now The one person I totally never liked, but I know him better now And he is definitely someone that I like  But he has been coming onto Chelsey over the last few days And I know she has a boyfriend but I think he DOESN’T like me And well I guess that is not really one of the big concerns But I guess everything worries me cause I am a teenager  I am only sixteen but with everything there comes stress And sometimes it seems like things are just too much to handle I think sometimes how things would just be different If I just made a choice, one choice that would change things forever  Sometimes I am so certain, but other times I am not so sure This choice is the one of suicide but I don’t want to hurt others around me And my dreams I want to come true, but if they don’t Then I will be crushed forever, and I could not let that happen  And sometimes everything just seems to go wrong All I want sometimes is to be somewhere else, and be happier But even today I was looking through the yearbook and looked at the staff pictures There I saw Mrs. J and I just looked and stared at her picture forever  I thought to myself that I couldn’t hurt this one person that seems to care so much And as I looked at her smiling in that picture I remembered a specific day The day of the social final, the day before the science final and what happened It was when I was walking down the hall upstairs and I wasn’t exactly all too happy  But there she was, and there I was just walking down the hall and I looked up Then our eyes I guess connected and she just smiled and I never felt a feeling like that Cause it made me smile too and the feeling inside I cannot describe From then I knew she does care about me, and would care if I were gone one day  She would probably think I am crazy if I ever told her that I felt like she was an angel But I feel like as if she was sent by God to be in my life right now Honestly I don’t know where I would be if it weren’t for her, she has made a difference All the times I wanted to die, but all the times she stopped to ask how things were going  All the times I just wanted to give up, but she just smiled Sometimes a smile means more than words ever will, and sometimes that is all it takes I realize that words don’t always fix things, or make them better But it is so true that if one person you know cares it can make all the difference  My life is my no means perfect, and I feel as if though I have a lot of things on my plate I mean I have some confusing feelings about love right now And I have many feelings about where I will go in life, and if dreams will come true I guess I can’t forget that there are also great things and people that come into my life  Maybe these are common feelings for teenagers or maybe they are not My feelings are  not really things that can be discussed, which makes it much harder But I feel a lot better now that I have thought about what has been bothering me And maybe this is all normal, maybe this is just life at sixteen  ~Vanessa
