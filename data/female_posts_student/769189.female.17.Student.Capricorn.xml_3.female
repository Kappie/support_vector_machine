Tired beyond belief, I never knew someone could get so bone tired just from babysitting two kids for an hour at the pool...Dude, I'm gonna die tomorrow, Tennis is gonna kill me. thank god this is the last week of it. not to mention I got sunburned like nobodys business today. I'll be radioactive red tomoorow as I'm only lobster pink today. I failed my tennis evaluation so I'm still 1.0 Suckieness...But I tried! It would have been nice if my friend had stayed to watch though. Oh well. Tomorrow will be better!
