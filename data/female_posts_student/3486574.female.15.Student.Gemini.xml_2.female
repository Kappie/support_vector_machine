There's leftovers for the tickets in the hello! shop. I got the news from an email sent by my online friends. They said that they came even at 4 something(which was the time when I went there again the second time)and they could redemm the tickets without fear! Argh!!  I thought with such a queue, surely the tickets have been out like hotcakes! But no! And worst of all, they can choose whatever they want! Not according to the amount of people! And most of the people chooses other merchandise like the DVD and posters and the passes. That's why there's so many leftover tickets! But then again, when I read on with the email, I realize something! No wonder the people don't want the tickets! If they had the tickets, they have to apply for a new line! And that means they have to spend more money for a pair of tickets,and it is not worth it at all! That's why almost everyone want something else!  Geez, now that I know the truth about it,I wasn't that upset over it. Coz even if I got the tickets, I couldnt have gone to the concert without applying for another line. Moreover, I've already got the DVD..I dont see why I need another one. And for the passes, erm I dont kinda have the time to queue up with those fans to get just the autograph of Jolin! So, I think I will pass up that too! Lastly, for the LIMITED edition Poster...it's kind of waste though..But still then again, even if i got the poster, i would just throw it one side like the poster doesn't exist. So, after all these serious thinking, I wasn't THAT depress on them.   Afterall, the best thing is, I've had a wonderful time in Orchard! That's the most important thing...                                      ************   Oh yeah! I got the news from a friend in the japanese exchange program that May and her partner got a tiff over something. Ha! Serve May right! (Hey, I'm not being mean here. But she really deserve that! Since she've been acting all the while! Trying to be teacher's pet. Though she still failed. And always acting cute! I can't stand people of this kind!) And god, she even cried! (Muahahahahaha!!!) My friend did absolutely the right thing! Ha! Know what she did? She actually treat my friend as HER maid! She kept ordering her to do things for her when my friend herself needed to do her own. And she even wanted my friend to help her keep her dirty clothes while she bathe! How could she! And that's not her first time, according to my friend. That's why my friend could tolerate no more and quarrel with her! (Good job! Hehe!)  And she even dare to complained all that to E and A (shortforms..) Then they told my friend about it. That's how she learnt that. And for 2 solid days, whenever May wanted to talk to my friend, she ignored her. (Wee!! Way to go!!)I bet May definitely doesn't have a good time in japan! Hahahaha!! That's something glad to hear. And to think she was still looking so forward to it! This should teach her a lesson!   Oh well..I've to go now..Going to catch my favourite tv shows.. Lolx  Laters!!
