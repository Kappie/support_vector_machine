(haha! passing by that teddy bear store- me: *looking at machine in front* that's not how you make cotton candy!  jadie: lexie...that's not cotton candy- it's bear stuffing me: *laughing head off* whoops :p)   We sat in the way back of the rather small theatre which was surprisingly packed for so long after the release! i sat beside some little kid who asked me for my candy during the movie at a 'touching part' (but i didn't really mind cuz i started to zone off... i mean, plz, i got the point in the beginning of aunt mae's little speech) i feel bad now...i should have told him to ask his mother before i gave him candy (2 coke bottles- he asked twice) ...i hope he's not vegetarian... coke bottles are made with gelatin which has ground up bones hahah how can we still eat these knowing that?! and also i hope he doesn't get sick.  or bouncing off the walls hyper...then sick.. gah! feeling stupid   The movie was surprisingly good for a sequel!  almost as good if not better than the first one! it seems to me closer to the original comics, and it opens the door nicely for spidey 3.  tobey looks funny in a lot of the scenes! lol! since amy and kelly have not seen the movie yet, i shall not ruin it...all i can say is...there's a healthy dose of MJ and Peter! :P   I kept singing hedley on the bus and when we were walking around... right now i'm listening to mariah carey's "all i want for christmas" yes, in the middle of august! haha! quite a change from hedley! :P i think i got a bit tired of listening to those songs over and over again! this song makes me thing of 'love actually', a pretty good movie!  haha the little kid saved it..and the story with the porn stars was funny and kinda sweet, and the part where the guy and girl from work ("how long have you been working here?" "1 year, 2 months and 3 hours" "and how long have you been in love with him?" "1 year, 2 months, and 2.5 hours" ...those are approximate numbers, but it followed that sort of general thing) are about to sleep together- watching with ramir is funny- he kept cheering them to get it on, then telling us that we should stop telling them to just go because they had to build up the sweetness or whatever! hahahah!   1:45..church tomorrow morning and must shower and iron my clothes! shall post more when stuff happens! ta
