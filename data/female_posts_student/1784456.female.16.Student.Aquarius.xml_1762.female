One of the guys had a really low voice, and they didn't do the whole speaking happily when they were being positive thing! How confusing :P Ah well, I'm sure the almightly power of fluke will pull me through some how. Was kind of scary though... we've actually reached our exams. Yeay for Glastobury after them!
