I'll just ignore the fact that that holiday is the shining example of all the propaganda this country has been feeding us and that there was no first thanksgiving like we're told it was and when the pilgrams came it was really just the beginning of a huge Native American genocide. Oh yeah and there is that whole thing of me being a vegetarian so seeing a huge dead bird on the table is possibly the most disgusting thing I could see while eating. But I get two days off so... Happy Turkey Day y'all.
