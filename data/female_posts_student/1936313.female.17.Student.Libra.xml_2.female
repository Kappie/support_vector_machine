Shannon and Christopher have gone back to Ireland (thank God) so I don't have to deal with that stress... Went shopping at Trafford Centre... got my gold shoes for grad (only Â£25! Thats about $65 cnd.) soo woohoo and all that... I think we're going 10-pin bowling tonight with Lyn and John and his girlfriend Cath. Cath makes birthday cards and the such, they're really quite neat.. hehe.. I'm trying to convince her to sell them online and let me build her a posh website.. but hey.. thats me.... Dads going to the pub (nothing new) to watch the Manchester City match on t.v... silly reallly... Andrew and I bug him because we're Manchester United fans... (come on David Beckham!!!)  We go the Stratford-upon-Avon to see the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Romeo and Juliet.. so hooray! Tuesday at 7:30.. in the Dressing Circle (-rolls eyes- first thing Dad asks the booking office "Does that mean we have to be dressed?") eesh.. welll totally pysched for that... I much prefer Romeo and Juliet over Macbeth... though The Merchant of Venice is playing at the Lowry and I wouldn't mind seeing that... (I know the story of Romeo and Juliet fairly well.. but I studied The Merchant of Venice in grd. 10... Macbeth in grd. 11 and just finished Othello this year)  Think thats 'bout it for now.... having some supper then off for some bowling... Miss ya all.. loves 'n such.. don't have toooo much fun in the cold... (i'm only teasing.. it isn't much better here.. though i can walk around without a coat.... despite the fact that the rain is very unorganized and comes in bouts without any warning and the wind is kinda fierce)
