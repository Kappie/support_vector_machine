I forget what it's called, but it was about this black rain that made people want to kill each other and have sex or something. Maybe I'm imagining the "having sex" part. But anyways, in the book a girl gets raped in a bathtub. And then this couple has sex in a restaurant bathroom against the door or something. Oh well, that isn't important. It was a weird book. Oh, and this guy was at a gas station when the rain was falling, and he stuck the gas nozzel down this persons throat and poured gas into them. I then think he lit the person on fire, but I'm not too sure. I read it in like 7th grade. Oh, I think it was called Black Rain. I could be wrong...dammit, I went off on a tangent. I had a reason to blog, and it wasn't about some messed up book I read. Anyways...I sent Josh an email trying to tell him what I thought of our "situation". Basically, the ball's in his court and I'm fine with that. Whatever happens, happens. All I can do is wait to see what it is that will happen...whether it be nothing or something. I dunno. Well, that's it for now from me. Peave! (Don't ask, it's an Amanda thing)
