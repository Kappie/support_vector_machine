You would have sworn in this quiz, if I had made it an option.      urlLink   Which Weird Latin Phrase Are You?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Frighteningly enough...with what I know of Latin this is pretty close to right, and yes staying up until the wee hours of the morning, although enjoyably creative, puts me in the irritable side of moods.  *sigh* Someday I will learn how to make my blog look at least halfway interesting. I've taken a peak at others and mine's just downright boring, but such is life. Not only do I try to keep things simple, but I also don't get a lot of free time to beat my head against the wall learning HTML. :-)
