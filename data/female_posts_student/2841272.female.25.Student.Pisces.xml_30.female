What you need to know about Volume 1 is:  1) it is a spectacular film in which Tarantino makes a triumphant return to the cinema by delivering this action masterpiece.  2) it is a completely separate movie from it's sequel, but it works incredibly well with it.    Kill Bill Vol. 2  , though equally stylish, shows the director's fondness for the emotional tones that make his characters so intriguing. While still enthusiastically violent, the film moves on it's key players and away from the brilliant mass gore of the first installment.   Kill Bill Vol. 2  , stands on its own as a self-sufficient movie that works without the viewers even having seen Volume 1 -- or having an obsessive knowledge of the countless obscure '70s chopsocky epics that are the object of Tarantino's homage.  A radically different tone is evident in the opening flashback sequence, shot in stunning black and white, which finally introduces the elusive Bill(played by David Carradine in the performance of his career), who was barely seen in Vol. 1. There is a long exchange of Tarantino's trademark stylized dialogue between Bill and his about-to-be married former lover, The Bride(Uma Thurman) who's name turns out to be Beatrix Kiddo, before Bill and his hit squad wipe out the entire wedding party, and leave Beatrix for dead.  Beatrix has three names left on her list: Elle Driver(Daryl Hannah), who has replaced her as Bill's lover; Bill's brother Budd(Micheal Madsen), retired from killing to a humiliating existence as a bar bouncer; and Bill himself, who we found out at the end of Vol. 1 wonders if she is aware that her daughter is alive and living with him in Mexico.  One of the movie's special delights is a long sequence recapping the way The Bride acquired her deadly skills from reclusive kung-fu master Pai Mei, played by Asian action superstar Gordon Liu. The entire section is a loving tribute to the original -- and unfortunately by today's standards, hokey -- Asian kung fu movies that so influenced Tarantino.  Tarantino creates another masterful fight scene when he pits the two amazonian blondes against one another in Budd's broken-down trailer. But I'll touch on that in a bit, the real classic sequence in this movie -- alone worth the price of admission -- has Budd shooting Beatrix in the chest with salt pellets and then burying her alive in a coffin. Micheal Madsen gives an awe inspiring performance in which he shines in every scene. None more prevalent than the scene with David Carradine at the start of the movie, in which Budd tells his older brother that he sold his priceless Hattori Hanzo katana at a pawn shop for 250 bucks. Every time that Madsen is on screen you can't help but smile, and yes, also the performance of his career.   Now, back to the battle of the amazons. Daryl Hannah plays against type as a conscienceless killer who wants nothing more than to be the one to kill The Bride. At one point, when Budd is writhing in pain from sustaining three bites from the deadly black mamba, she informs him that she regrets that the Bride died at the hands of someone like Budd, and not someone like her. As I said before, this is a masterful creation. It has everything a great fight scene needs to have, including an astonishing shot in which we see Beatrix down the hall holding Budd's Hanzo sword. The music in the background of that shot is what sells it as one of the single greatest shots in action movie history.  After all this, Beatrix is finally on the threshold of fulfilling the title. The confrontation with Bill consists of more talking than fighting, a choice which fits the circumstances. And nothing's quite as funny as Bill's vastly understated explanation/apology for putting such a bloody end to her wedding plans: "I, uh, overreacted." The seated combat scene between the two former lover's is impressive, but short. And in thinking about it, my only real complaint about the movie, like I have said in past reviews, the final fight is a vital piece of any action movie. And make no mistake,   Kill Bill  , in it's entirety, is a action movie.   Grade: B+   Nick Jensen
