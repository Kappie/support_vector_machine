Boing???   Boing???   What is   wrong   with these people! Spam is all about quantity over quality. I tell you what, if those folks would just take a little longer to stop and think of better subject lines, they'd be raking in the... e-mail addresses. What kind of subject line is "Boing! The sound produced by a little pill!" From who? Bonita Williams. That's just wrong. Oh, I know I said I was done for the day, but I couldn't resist commentary on that spam. "Boing!" indeed.
