I was at Kates house and we having a D and M when my friend Fiona rang me. She said that we had both gotten an email from Josh. Heres the unexpected part... it was an apologetic email. This is what it said:  Hi,  Look guys i need to say this...  Sorry  I am really sorry. I really am. My life has been fucked up the last couple of months really... maybe longer and im really sorry that i took it out on you. I know it was most definatly not the right thing to do. I admit what I did was incredibly wrong, illegal i believe. And i know sorry doesnt fix it but im just saying it cos well... i still love yous. You guys were great friends and in quite literal terms... I fucked that up. As I said Ive been through some trying times and ive copt a fair bit from people for what ive done to you. My anger has been building up for a long time. Well you would be pretty pissed if you had been moved around in the space of 12 months like a fucken hermit crab (sorry i couldnt think of a better analogy). But it is no reason for me to take it out on you. One more time I say sorry to you. I dont expect forgiveness. All I ask is that you read this and reply. It mite be the first steps I need to help me to recover.  Have a nice day Josh  I replied saying...  Im not really sure what to reply, im not sure if what u said is true, or whether its just another trick. I would like to believe its true, but honestly, i dont have any trust for u. It could be 1 big game, i dont know, but u asked for a reply. So here i am replying, pretty much speechless.  From Lisa  Then he wrote back:  hey i know that you cant trust me. i havent done much for you to trust me. but this no joke. no game. no trick. i would love for you to believe me. but i know it takes time and effort for someone to trust another human being. this next bit is me speaking from the heart about why i was so angry towards you. look lisa you and me were good friends. but you really did break my heart. i was in love with you. i thought you were everything a guy could want in a girl. you were kind. you were caring. you were funny. you were heaps of things. but when we broke up it really hurt me. i turned how you mite... crazy? i have never been the same since then. but what i didnt realise in all my bitterness was that you and me could be great mates. instead i was stupid enough to start fucking that up by treating you like shit. treating other around you like shit. but in times of great need... you were still there. amazing. i can still remember when i walked to your place in the rain, and we had a pillow fight. at that point i remembered all the good times we had together and how much i missed them. so you would of thought at that point i would of changed. but i didnt. i became even more bitter and twisted. when i moved it hurt me. i was far away from friends who loved me. and i took it out on you. and fiona. two people who did care about me. but why did i do that? i suppose it was because you hurt me. i was still bitter about when you broke up with me. i was bitter about when you went out with jim. but i realise now that i was so so so stupid for doing that. i had absolutly no right to take my anger out on you. or fiona. it is seriously something that i wish i could go back and erase. im sorry lisa...  i really am  have a nice day josh... p.s i hope you know i was in tears writing this. it brought back lots of memories. most happy     Neways i g2g buh bye  Lisa xx
