I got to school by 10 AM, and settled in for a productive day on a nearly empty 2nd floor in the library.  3.  I got nearly all of my Con Law reading done for the week.  But see below.  4.  I left my computer at home in order to up my productivity level, and it largely worked.  If I weren't so generally lazy, I might have had a more productive day.  But considering if I'd had my computer with me, I'd have gotten even less done, I think I did pretty well.  The lowpoints:  1.  I was assigned to read the new campaign finance case that the Supreme Court decided just last year,  McConnell v. FEC .  And it took me nearly an hour to print.  It is very long.  I was put off by this, so I did all my other Con Law work instead and just skipped this case.  2.  I took a long lunch - this was actually a highlight, but as I'm talking about productivity and not my fun factor, I list it here.  3.  The talking people in the library (ugh!) distracted my focus on my Business Organizations reading, so I didn't get as much of a dent in that as I would have liked.  So I guess I left feeling pretty good.  And I made it home before dark, which makes me feel like I have more time this evening.  Perhaps I will use my time wisely and attack the aforementioned extremely long - but sure to be riveting - Supreme Court case.  Or maybe I'll just eat and watch TV.  Either way, I should be able to sleep well tonight.
