Even though she didn't tell me it was totally obvious. She ate with him everyday and she was the only girl at the table. She never really talked to me. It was just like she was cuaght in her own little world. Anna and I are usually pretty good friends. I HATE HIGHSCHOOL.  But while I was typing all that I realized how horrible everything was. I am just being stupid.  I talk about everyone behind there bakcs and I am GOING TO STOP.  But I need your help, whenever I do it alert me. And, you all don't talk about other people to me behing there backs becasue I will be SO tempted to listen and that is just as bad as if I was telling hte gossip myself.  That is all.  Waaa. I am way to emotional.
