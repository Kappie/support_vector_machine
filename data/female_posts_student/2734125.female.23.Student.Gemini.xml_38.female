I found the moving journal stacks today.  The shelves are all bunched together, and you follow your numbers and when you get there you push a button, and they very quietly shift over.  Its pretty cool.  I had all sorts of visions of being trapped in between them, and I felt sneaky being there, like it was a place that only those with a special pass or and eye scan should be.   I am suffering from a head cold, which is nasty and icky.  I hate being sick.  Its worse when its really nice outside.  It feels like your going against nature being ill.  The rest of the world is being reborn and all you want to do is lay down in a warm heap and be bitchy.  Its not really a bad cold, just stuffy.  I don't even feel that ill.  I was up at the cabin last weekend where a friend had the same thing.  The oddest part about this strange little bug is that only one of your nostrils gets stuffed up.  I think that's strange anyway.  My friend kept laying on his side and attempting to clear his sinuses.  I slept most of the night on one side trying to be able to breath out of that one side of my nose.  Nothing works.  I am on some brand X decongestant now... and I wonder if I should have given up the extra 5 bucks and gone for the good stuff.  I even compared labels trying to make sure that they had the same ingredients.  Oh well.   Dusk out.  Dusk is the most beautiful work.  It is like dust, but smoother and with a softer side.  It is like done, but less final and more of a word that feels like a transition.  Dusky makes me think of shadows that are turning the world a comfortable blue haze purple.  Dusk it letting go of day, and moving into the emotion of night, but with out the harsh dark.  There is a safety in dusk, watching the world move.  It is a time of day that I don't feel stressed.  It is a sudden breath after being constricted, but it doesn't make you pant.  I better go for a walk before the world slip's past this sublt kindness and into chill midnight blue.
