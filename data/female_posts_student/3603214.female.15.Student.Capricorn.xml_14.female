There is a lack of communication when he comes over, hence my blogging at this minute. My mother n him are talkin bout insurance. Sorry, but that's just stupid. Can't they do this some other time? Well, no...he's never around any other time. Go figure. So now I'm wasting my time doing nothing. It's a pointless celebration. I deserve two days dedicated to me more than he does, that's for sure. But I don't necessarily want to discuss his doings to turn my life into a living hell right now. It gets rather dull after a while. As much as we would all like it, he'll never change. Even Patti's fiance Eric *my "bro" in Iraq* has purdy much disowned my father even though he doesn't know him well. That's just pathetic. But of course my dad knows nothing of this. He doesn't know much of anything. He still thinks my mom is makin up everything I tell her that she relays to him..bbl
