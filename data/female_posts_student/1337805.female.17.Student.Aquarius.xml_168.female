Of course, we only have one DVD, Ice Age, but hopefully, with my christmas list that will change.  Of course, I myself want to take a huge leap back, or at least smash the computer. The one I'm using at school has this new fun twist of FREEZING, ERRORING and LOSING ALL MY WORK. If that's not a way to get kids to stop working, then I don't know what else is. The substitute we had was driving me crazy too, which doesn't help at ALL.  Youth group is tonight. Hurray. At least Laura is coming. She understands me, and helps me feel like there is a place for me at youth. Good things. Oh well. I'm taking my camera. Hopefully trying to take 5 shots. Must..resist....urge.  Must also get a new camera for the Gingerbread making dealie, and the YAC meeting. Want/need pictures of Tsuki bird, and Steve, and Samaya, and anyone else. Muust!!  Alrighty roo, I'm out. I'm tired, and dirty. San and Erin, I miss talking to you guys....There's been a mega drift here...:( I love you guys, just remember. Until the long weekend in may....
