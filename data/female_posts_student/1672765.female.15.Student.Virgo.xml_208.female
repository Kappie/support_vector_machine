I'm moving to Canada. Or The Netherlands. Maybe Finland. Possibly Russia. I was out picking up trash on the side of the road and  forgot  to wear sunscreen. I didn't forget, I did think about it but I always end up blowing the thought off. I shouldn't. I'm so pale/fair/sensitive. I think I got a little burnt. With my luck I'll probably end up getting a little tan. Blech. But anyways, with the whole trash thing. The majority of litter is soda bottles, cans and beer bottles and cans. Mainly Budweiser cans is what I always see. I asked my dad why so many people like Budwieser and he said something like maybe it's not that most people drink Bud more than any other beer, but maybe the people that drink it are more likely to litter. That makes sense, if you think about it. I mean someone that drinks Water with their Tofu Mushroom Wraps are probably way less likely to litter, you know? And folks that love their kegs and cheetos are more likely to litter, in a stereotypical kind of thinking. I got my Warped Tour tickets from UPS yesterday. Madness! They were supposed to come in like two weeks before the event I thought...and it's not until August 4th. I don't know what they are doing coming in so early...now I have a longer time to make sure I don't lose them.    I'm so sick, so sick of myself. Mother, say you'll pray for me. I'm so sick, so sick of myself. I'm premature in my decay.   I was wearing latex gloves outside and I can't get rid of the smell from my hands. -____- It's lousy.   I like kiwi.  I saw King Arthur with Sarah yesterday. I give it a C.   I think that's about all.  I bought eye drops today.   I need to clean my room.    Music:  Blue in the Face - Alkaline Trio
