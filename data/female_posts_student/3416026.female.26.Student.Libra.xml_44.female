The New York Times' "City" section ran a short  urlLink piece  yesterday about the guys that I call the Park Slope Mob, but who are apparently just a bunch of retired commodities brokers playing violins for days gone by.  You may or may not remember  urlLink my Bageltique review  from back in May.  But if you do, you may notice that the Times' characterization of Bageltique's service is totally consistent with my own.  Behold (from the NYT):  "The Bageltique is the kind of place where you can, if you want, try to order the usual, but the guy behind the counter may or may not remember, even if you have been there a thousand times, like Mr. Silinonte has."   And yet... and yet... not even ONE mention of ChinStrap.  So disappointing.
