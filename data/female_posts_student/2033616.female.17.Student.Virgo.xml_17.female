MK and i went shopping before youth group, we got 1 1/2 pairs of shoes between us (one each and we're sharing the third), so maybe there are advatages to having the same shoe size.  We got to church and I compleatly forgot that we were gonna be doing music.. so then i got to sing some more.  Somehow Lindsey and Jamie got Cory, Eric, and one of their friends to come to church, which only added to my frustration of being left out of the loop.  But what can you do.  I was extreamly hyper and very outgoing tonight... which might have been contributed to the fact that Brad and Evan didn't show, and Craig and Collin came late.  Not that I don't want them there, any and everyone should show for youth group, but it made me feel like i could say something without being ridiculed.  So that was youth group... oh and lindsey ripped her pants.. did i mention that?  Well then i had bells.  Yes and then bells was over.  And then i went home.  Boy is my life boring.  Which reminds me i'm sleepy, probably because of boredom... goodnight.
