Filled in my on-line journal and checked my e-mail compulsively for two      hours, successfully honing my computer skills for future use in work      related projects.     3.  Shared stories of bar fights with coworkers, embellishing the ass-kicking      I gave a girl at Stu's Midtown Tavern to literary proportions.  Which I believe      heightened overall morale.     4.  Deepened ass print in the swivel chair reserved for student workers, thereby      creating a more welcoming work environment for future employees.     5.  Took a break and talked to boyfriend on phone while smoking a skinny white      cigarette, which I really deserved because I have been way too focused on work      today.  I can't believe I only make $7 an hour.
