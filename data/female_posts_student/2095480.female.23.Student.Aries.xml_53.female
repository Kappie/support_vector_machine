Anyway, class is going well - albeit rather boring at times and work is non-existant. I did however, land a summer job pet-sitting my German professors cats for the entire summer, which is cool being that she is going to pay me $12 a day for it. Seems rather high to me, but I'm not arguing. It would be stupid to do so.    Jessica Simpson moment #2.      Liz: You must turn on the car to get air conditioning.   I'm going home this weekend just for a night to perform for my Dad's best friend's retirement. Miranda is going to accompany me - which is really cool b/c we'll get to hang out and perform together - being that there are two horn parts.   Jessica Simpson moment #3.      "Liz - You must put the name of your town and zip code when asked by the univ. for        your home address. Duh.   What else? I don't really know what to call it - but I'm sorta "seeing"(?) a new guy. Actually its Davis. He's been stuck in this town b/c of his job and we've been hanging out... alot. He's my friend from home and we bumped into each other a while back. If you want to read about its in the blog - a few entries back. Anyway, its really cool and who knows what will become of this.   Jessica Simpson moment #4.      "Liz - Yes, Zaxby's does accept cash"    I talked to Richard for the first time in a while - he's in Boston prepping for his Pacific oceanography sailing venture. He's loving it - and I told him to pet an orca for me.  Went to a party on Monday night. Kevin was host. Kevin, Jordon, Ken, Curtis , Joseph and Rainer were there. It was cool - I needed the party.   Well, that's it for now!
