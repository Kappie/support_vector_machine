I know its been a while since i last blogged in my blog but now i am finally back because i want all of you guys to know whats kicking in my life...and whats not. Well just talked to holliejo before she left and we talked about some serious stuff concerning her love-life...if there is one, because she isnt really positive about that aspect of her otherwise hard life. Not really lots new here. My ex-gf stopped by the house today and i kinda didnt really talk to her so she left after about 10 minutes, kinda angry that i didnt really talk but thats alright, too, because she was an ass first and now shes gotta pay for it. On the other hand i still like her a lot, but shes back together with her old boyfriend and i dont really know what to do. She s telling me all those things about that she still loves me and that she is only with him because she made a mistake and didnt wanna admit it to me. Well anyways. i dont really know what to think about the whole thingy with her. All i know is that my heart keeps telling me that i still love her and my mind says that i should stay away from her.....oh man this means hard times for a german.  WEll for now i gotta go because there will be the next match for the european soccer championships which i dont wanna miss because they are in the quarterfinals. So hope that you might also post something in my blog now that i am back on..,...yeah i am talking to you you crazy american girl holliejo... take care you guys and gals  lovelots Da German
