Okay, short short version  Road in front of house = paved next week Maybe driveways too Precalculus final = multiple choice = easier than anticipated No hike - PepBoys, thought a lot about my car. Although not standard, going to rice it out, and automatic is probably a better idea for now.  Hope Tycho realizes that no one has anything on him Miss him  ::sniff::   Soon! :-D  Pink series of Hondas (4) on the pike. Evan's Saturn "on steroids" kicked the crap out of Mike's Civic...TWICE. I would never want to give that credit to Saturns, but I have no special fondness to Civics (minus Del Sol), but that was awesome!  Rims, neons, stereos, spoilers, vinyls, NOS, exhausts, mufflers, everything.   Tycho and I had serious talks, which I am grateful for because then I know what is going on. I appreciate you giving me the honor of lisening when you had something to say.    Please have a good one, take care.  -J9
