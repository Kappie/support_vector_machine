Paralysed, I cannot breath tearstained, unable to inhale kneeled down, face on the ground screaming aloud but cannot hear the sound  I would have given my life why can't I give away my pain  For my mind of child unbearable inside inner demons feeded by my mind four walls still closing in why I still feel when I'm dead within
