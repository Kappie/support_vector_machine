I'm not allowed to see a movie tonight, I'm not allowed to go with her, my dad, and Janine and Jacob to see the Salsa play, and why is it that I'm going through this tourchure??  Because I have to study for my French exam!! This is inhuman!  I can't study all night right?  That'd just be wrong.  I wouldn't absorb any information-- in one ear and out the other type senario.    She painted again.  Nothing major, just a mirror and a table... but the fumes.... They're really starting to get to me.  I hate the smell of paint!!  I already know everything I need for French.  What the hell am I doing studying??  This is just excesive torchure.  Beat me with a Night Stick why don't yea.    They just left... It's like it's a freaking family outting or something.  Yea, way to make a kid feel special.  (Bubble....  >...)  Thanks everyone.    The urge to half sheet their bed is absolutly overwhelming.
