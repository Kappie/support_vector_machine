I did sleep in until 7am, and that made me a little happy.  I got to work, and nothing was planned for my birthday.  I'm not surprised though because several people in our office are on vacation, including the one person I share July as a birth month with.  I think they're going to do something on Monday because when I came in yesterday, Cat asked me what time I will be in on Monday morning.  I don't know though.  Not too worried about it, to be truthful.  Dad took me out to lunch at Lone Star and it was nice.  It improved my mood substantially, that's for sure.  We had a good meal and talked about things.  I got to vent about being so stressed about school, which made me feel a ton better.  He assured me that my hard work is not going unnoticed and that he (and Sharon) are very proud of me.  I'm glad he told me that because even though I know it, it works wonders on my confidence when I actually hear it from someone.  After lunch we stopped by Batteries Plus where Dad gave him something that was in the paper (Dad wouldn't tell me what it was, but I suspect it was prices on digital cameras) and Todd came out to the car and gave me a birthday kiss.  I talked to Shelley and she and Paul are going to meet me and Todd at the Hilltop Inn tonight for dinner.  That should be fun.  I'm going to get me some catfish fiddlers, mmm-mmm!  First though, I'm going to go home after I get off of work and I'm going to run a nice, hot bubble bath, pop open a beer (or pour a margarita), turn on some classical music and I'm going to pamper myself.  Fuck.  Mom's mad.  I don't know who exactly she's mad at though.  She called me earlier and I missed her call.  So I called her back and left a message for her to call me back, which she did.  Well she's disappointed that me and Shelley and Paul and Todd are going out to dinner but they weren't invited.  She said, "Don't you remember me asking if you wanted to do something last week?"  I told her, "Yes, and I told you that I am so stressed out about school that I didn't want to think about it so I left it up to Shelley and Todd.  Shelley called Todd and they got everything straightened out and I said that was fine."  She said, "Well it would have been nice if they would have thought of other people.  I would have called Todd but I didn't have his number."  I said, "Well, I told Shelley to call Todd and talk to him about it."  "Well, she didn't say anything to me.  Well, I hope you all have a nice dinner."  "I'm sorry she didn't say anything about it to you.  I'll stop by there tomorrow."  "Well, call to make sure we're there.  Talk to you later."  Now I feel like shit because Shelley's lack of consideration for others.  God damnit.  It's my fucking birthday!  I don't want to do a damn thing, now.  After dinner I guess Todd and I are going to go home and watch  Mystic River , even though I have no desire to watch that movie.  I'm just not into movies anymore.  It'll probably be good.  I should try to be positive, huh?  Yeah, good luck.  Maybe I'll get lucky and smoke a bowl.
