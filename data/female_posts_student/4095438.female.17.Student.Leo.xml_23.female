I think the only live one was the womens' 4x100m relay, which was also undoubtedly the highlight :D The USA has had a stranglehold on the event for years and the last time Australia won gold in a womens' relay was in Melbourne in 1956 when the likes of Dawn Fraser ruled the pool. Veteran Petria Thomas  Olympic debutantes Jodie Henry, Alice Mills and Lisbeth Lenton swam a new world record of 3:35:94 to hold off the Americans. I was especially proud of Jodie Henry, who swam an awesome final leg to hold off the American Jenny Thompson :D  I plan on listing all of Australia's medal wins, mostly so I can keep track myself without all of the TV coverage I'm used to. I'm also interested to see if the  urlLink predicted letdown  after hosting an Olympics will come into play.
