It all started when I was looking for a vintage chair for my new apartment and has escalated from there.  I am pretty stingy about the money thing though, and only bid when it is cheap.  So I am usually outbid, and have won nothing so far.    Garage sales.  Friday morning I got up around 8 and went to probably 30 garage sales before 10:30.   They were all within about a 6 mile radius.  And you would think, that because this town is so small, I would know all the street names and have an easy time navigating the sales.  Not so.  There are so many freakin streets called Hyde Park it is unbelievable.   And they are all within a mile of each other.  There is Hp Circle, Hp Dr., Hp ST., Hp Lane, Hp Court, Hp Pkwy.  So I didn't find anything worth buying all morning and then hit the jackpot right as I was about to give up.  There is this little warehouse down the road from my house, and two old ladies use it to store all their stuff.  They were cleaning it out and had a lot of really cool old vintage sheets, Lamps, and furniture.  I got a rust colored lamp, with the Chinese looking flowers on it.  I got a set of King size sheets in this cool white with pale blue flowers, with two sheets, a fitted sheet, and three pillowcases to make curtains out of. All that for $5.50.  Not too bad.  Considering I wanted a lamp that was $78 from pottery barn.  I was going to get this really cool carved table thing for only $3, but in the end I decided it was way too big for my apartment.  First, let me say, I am a damn good waitress.  And because of this I get respect from the other waitresses and the managers.  And because of that I get away with a lot more than I should.  But, I never do anything stupid.  Tonight, the manager on duty found out I was only two years younger than him.  He is the only unmarried manager.  He was buying drinks for the whole crew to try, like three drinks at the beginning of the shift.  And then later on he came up to me, and wanted me to do an Irish Car Bomb with him in the office.  Talk about stupid.  It is one thing to say you are going to buy one drink for 12 people to split and try it so that they know what they are selling.  And entirely another to take shots with an employee under you in the office.  I wouldn't do it, so he did both shots himself.  I think he must have kept drinking, because he looked smashed when I left work.  News from Africa.  Evidently Guinea has become a very tense area, more so than before.  The Guinean franc has been devalued again, as of this weekend.  They pulled all the PC volunteers from their posts and all 30 of them are in Conakry together.  The Govt.  has told them to stay within two blocks of the embassy at all times.  Late on Friday there were riots over the price of rice, with all the govt. officials blaming each other. Gangs of youths are holding up any vehicle that might be carrying food.  And as news spreads more and more people are joining in. Police are denying the 20 odd deaths the people say happened when the police shot into the crowd.  I haven't heard from Evan, but I talked to his mom today.  There is not another girl, never was evidently.  He just doesn't want me waiting on him to come home because he doesn't know if he will come home.  As much as I say I've moved on there is still a little hope deep down that in the future everything will work out.  Maybe 10 yrs from now when we've both had a chance to do everything we want to do.
