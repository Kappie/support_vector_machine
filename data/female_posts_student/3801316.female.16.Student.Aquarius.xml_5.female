Fortunately, yesterday, our principal announced that aircons would be installed na. Provided that students would pay an additional 50 pesos a month. That's only 500 for the whole year! Sounds great, right?  So, night comes and my mom arrives from our store. There i was all excited and happy to tell her the good news... and guess what? She starts ranting and yakking about how the school should have thought about it before na and dapat 'di na nila singilin yung parents. Of course, defensive little me, tried to reason out. But then, my oh-so-opinionated sister whom i expect to at least understand, rolls her eyes at me and gives me a nice, big, fat smirk. Then, my eyes start to well up with tears as i hear her shout "VAL, ANG SENSITIVE MO... SOBRA!!!" Great sister, huh? You can totally have her! And this is how the new high school building made me cry.  And oh, the comfort rooms don't even have mirrors! Comfort rooms aren't comfort rooms without mirrors! Mirrors are comforting!!!
