       
      New fresh empty reformatted same old computer.  Greg has been brainwashed and he's a tiny bit faster than he used to be. He's absorbing all the new stuff and he's being well-manned besides the fact he's not in good terms with Norton. But IT'S OKAY - nothing that didn't have an alternate route.  Now to just fill him back with MP3s and some new songs. And to pray that he doesn't fuck up again.   Technology and me. Me and Technology.  It's like peanut butter with White Curry.
