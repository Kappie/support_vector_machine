Mogu People arehuman (sort-of) shaped versions of those  urlLink stress-relief pillows . Mogu people aren't just "huggable companions", they are mythic beings, each one representing a "Power We All Possess". Sounds a little scary, yes, but they're talking about things like courage, curiousity, dream, love, sucess, or joy. Joy is especially cute, with her multi-colored bubble body.    The Mogu People are already available as screensavers for cell phones. Following the fall release of the pillows, there will be t-shirts, watches, toys, bags, and hats.    Reserve yours now at  urlLink Mogu if you want to be able to sell it on Ebay in December.
