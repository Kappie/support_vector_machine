That's the "Reality Television Virus."  It is quite catching.  I had hoped that, like chicken pox, you could only get it once.  It turns out that, like chicken pox, it really just moves into a latent phase, waiting to strike again when you least expect it.  Unlike chicken pox, it doesn't lead to a painful skin lesion following the path of a dermatome (shingles).  It just leads you to watch ALL reality TV shows imaginable.  Here's my list:  urlLink American Idol ,  urlLink The Apprentice ,  urlLink Top Model ,  urlLink Forever Eden ,  urlLink Playing it Straight .  And now there is one coming out called  urlLink The Swan. .  Personally, I think it is an absolutely AWFUL premise, yet I feel drawn to it.  I blame RTVV.  American Idol was amazing last night.  I really like John Peter Lewis.  There is no reason, other than the fact that he is just having fun.  I get the feeling that he decided to audition as some joke, and the fact that he's made it this far totally amazes him.  Granted, the fact that he flew to Hawaii to audition, which probably means that he invested more than a passing thought in the competition.  But, doesn't he seemed amazed to have made it this far?  Humble, anyway.  That said, the guy has no chance of winning.  Not that I can see.   urlLink My favorite idol website .  Go Fantasia!  I missed Top Model, but I see April was kicked off.  Huh.  I thought she'd win.  Looks like Shandi's got it.  I must get started.  It is after 1, and I have yet to open a book today.   urlLink Le sigh...
