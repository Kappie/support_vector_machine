Anyway, I went back to bed and slept 'til noon. My throat still hurts like hell though. Ah well...  I'm supposed to be going with Helen to her tutoring job on Tuesday. She's with my 6th grade math teacher on Tuesdays now. Apparently she mentioned my name and he really wants me to visit. At least someone misses me.     urlLink       I have nothing more to say. I'm off to find some herbal tea...
