Jamie and Landon have this great idea top have the dress rehersal at the orphanage. It maybe something different. But when Landon and Jamie got there. They saw Mr. Jenkins and he thought that it wouldn't be a very good idea. mainly because this was an orphanage and Mr. Jenkins doesn't want them remebering that they have no parents on Christmas. You see the play is about a father who comes to realize how much he loves his daughter and that would bring sadness to the childrens eyes. Jamie saw this and said, I never thought of it that way before. So as they were leaving Landon noticed that Jamie was really sad, so he decided to go and see the kids with her. He new that she must want to go and see them so he ofered to let her go. He went in with her. Landon soon noticed how poor this orphanage was, they had little toys, they used newspapers to color oon because they had no coloring books, and the ping pong table had no net. It looked as if it hadn't been used in years. anyway, Landon and Jamie started to walk toward the kids and one of them turned around to see who it was. The little boy screamed out "Jamie" after that all the children turned around and strtedc running toward them. Soem of the kids ignored them because they were to interested in watching the tv that they barely realized that Jamie was even in the room. They couldn't see the tv very well so those that didn't go to see Jamie and Landon moved closer to the tv when oters moved out. Some of the kids thought that Landon was Jamies boyfriend but Jamie soon stratend it out. She told them that he was just a friend. They all had to go after a while. And jamie told the childrent hat she would be back soon. She didn't state whether or not Landon would be there. That was were I stopped reading. Check back tommorow or later this afternoon for updates.
