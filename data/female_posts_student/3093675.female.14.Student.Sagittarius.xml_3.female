The bad news is, report cards come out on friday, and a lot of my grades suck. I brought up my English and Science grades, and my art grades are always pretty decent, but geography, math, and french i have all Ds and possibly Fs. YIKES!!!! NOT GOOD!!!! I'm gonna do some h/w now- i'm gonna start typing up my notes every night and putting them in my notebooks, thats how much i wanna pass all my classes next quarter. If i dont, then i'm grounded for the freakin SUMMER!!!   Playlist-  Rancid- Indestructable
