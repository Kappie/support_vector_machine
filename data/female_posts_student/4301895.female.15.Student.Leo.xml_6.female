O free me, O free me The mirror melts, I'm somewhere else Inside eternity Where you on Outstretched wings Sing within The Garden of Everything Where memories Call to me Backward dreams? Or phantom reality? Call to me, they call to me And so here we are Lovers of Lost Dimensions Burning supernovas of all sound and sight Every touch, a temptation And for every sense, a sensation Eyes of pure Deep azure Quite unbelievable The sun's daughter You've been made Not to fade Quite inconceivable Each atom sings to me "Set me free From chains of the physical." O free me, O free me A love like ours A starry flower Through seasons and centuries As rivers reach the sea You'll reach me With songs of your symmetry A small boat There will float To far off coasts The Isle of Infinity Come with me, O come with me Here we'll see Love's lost tree Made out of miracles Emotions, crystal leaves To cover me And you in eternity Each atom sings to us Through the blood "Love is a miracle" Sings softly, it sings softly And so here we are Lovers of Lost Dimensions Burning supernovas of all sound and sight Every touch, a temptation And for every sense, a sensation And so here we are Twin stars of brilliant brightness Lanterns lit by life for all the depths of night And every day will return us To arms of the ever eternal And so here we are So far from earthy orbits Burning supernovas of all sound and sight Where every day will return us To arms of the ever eternal    ~A memorial to Danielle~
