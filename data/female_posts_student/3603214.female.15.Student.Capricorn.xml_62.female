And I think it was worse for the cast because we had to sit there while our asses became numb. Red House was funner. I even got to be part of the crew. That was exciting lol. AND Maddy's gonna protest to Loren *director of Godspell* tellin him that I deserved a better role lol. And we also decided that I should sign up for student director for the fall play FO SHO. Cuz then I can b like Brad! I can't hear a damn word your saying and give stage! lol her words, not mine. But I like the direction in which she's going. O! And I need an opinion. What would be the better musical for CHS to perform? West Side Story or Grease? I prefer Grease mainly because it's more popular and seems like more fun, and I've never seen a blonde Maria. And another thing, me n Brad are the only drama singers, so we'll purdy much get the leads in w/e musical they do. I guess that's a plus. Leads are hella fun. Little parts aren't as fun, but I was just reminded of the number one rule/law thing in community theater: There are no small roles, only small people. I hafta continue to remind myself bout that...It's hard since I can b a ham. ARG.  I thought of something fun...I'm gonna try to sing the National Anthem for the football games. I'm gonna find out where I can sign up or w/e. Well, our football sucks, but i don't really care. It would get me outta the house. And then I can freeze my ass off in 40 or 50 degree weather like at homecoming. We only scored 7 points compared to the other team's 40 something score. Maybe soccer would b a better route...HmMmMmMmM...
