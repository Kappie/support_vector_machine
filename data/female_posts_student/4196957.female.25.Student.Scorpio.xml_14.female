Anyway, just thought I'd post my favorite college final joke because my brain is much too tired for blogging today.       Joey was taking Calculus at UCLA. He struggled with it, and worried about failing. Final exam time came, and he studied and studied, but, still he was not ready. The Professor passed out the exams and told the class that they had only 30 minutes. Every five minutes, he reminded the class how much time was left. This only made Joey more and more nervous. Finally, after 30 minutes, the Professor said, "Stop! The exam is over. Turn them in!" One by one, the papers were handed in. But, Joey just kept working on that exam. The Professor decided to wait it out and see how long it would take him. After another 20 minutes, Joey turned in his exam. The Professor asked him, "What are you doing?" Joey answered, "Turning in my exam." The professor then told Joey, "The exam was over 20 minutes ago. You have failed!" Joey then looked the Professor in the eye, and asked, "Do you know who I am?" The professor answered, "No." Then Joey asked, "You really don't know who I am, do you?" as if he were a very important person. The Professor again, said, "No, I don't know who you are and I don't care!" Then Joey shoved his exam right in the middle of the other exams, that were on the Professor's desk, and said, "Good!"      Genius, pure genius! I wish I could pull that off, but, unfortunately, all my professors know (and fear) me.
