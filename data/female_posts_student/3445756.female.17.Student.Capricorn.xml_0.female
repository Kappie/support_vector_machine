My parents expect me to get a job. Its a town of 300, where the hell am I going to get a job. My mom says I could shred papers at the bank. Um I think they could hire a 3 year old to push the button on the paper shredder. Yet, somehow my brother never had to go and find a job, he was always guaranteed a job working on the ranch. But I'm a girl, so of course I can work on the ranch, if I do it will be more 3 year old jobs. My parents can seem to let me grow up, I will forever be 3................  There is this person say her name is Betty. Well Betty drives me insane!! Betty has dated "Bob" for like 2 years. But the part is they are worse then a married couple. When in D.C. for Close-Up Betty made such a big deal about not spending enough time w/ Bob, when actually they were w/ each other the whole time, except for sleeping! Betty is very dumb, and its not just my opinion! If you'd like I can do surveys on her and send ya the statistics. Betty signed up for AP classes just because Bob is smart and is taking them. The teachers even recommended that she not take them. I was going through the history tests the other day and she got like a 50% on most of them. In our grading scale anything below a 71% is an F! It drives me insane! When she was in 8th grade she dated this colored guy and he was a druggie, drunk, dumbass(no offense to anyone colored) but yeah so she was like that to, she acted all bad and dressed insane. But then they broke up when she was a freshman and she started to go out with Bob. But the killer part is she changed her personality to fit Bob since he is a goody-goody. She's the kind of girl who doesn't know who the hell she is and has to depend on a guy. Now to the next disgusting part, she is always sticking her hand down her pants to pick her thong out of her butt. It is so disgusting! If ya can't handle a thong, don't wear them.  So what it comes down to, is she basically drives me insane! She's nice and all there is just something about her. Just think I have to spend the whole year being co-cheerleading captain with her!  Well I'm off to eat pizza and pop, which of course Betty would never approve of since its not the healthy thing to do and it could really hurt my physical ability for cheerleading the summer!
