Luckily, my WMST professor is letting us have today off so I will get out early at ~2pm-ish instead of 4:30pm...which should be a consolation but my eyelids are closing while I'm trying to type this so I know I'm going to crash as soon as I get home :/  First session ends next Wednesday so I'll only have ARST1070 to deal with for the rest of the month. I thought that my prof didn't like me or my artwork (not that it matters on any level aside from my grade) but this week we've been doing ink washes and my past experience with watercolours has proved to be my saving grace of sorts as I feel less awkward using this medium and can just go with it...he's also complimented me on each one I've done and I'd be lying if I said I didn't geekily smile a little on the inside when I'm praised by professors. ^^;;;;;
