I mean I ate healthy and everything.  I am hoping that maybe my weight is up because I am building muscle mass cause of exercise or because of the large water intake increase.  I am scared though.  I don't want to gain anymore weight.  My Mom and I am going to Timmys for lunch tomorrow and then on Thurs we are going out to Earls with the neighbor's and then to Peters Drive In.  That would be nice if I had like super metabolism and like didn't eat anything else those days.  Maybe when I go to Summer School the weight will come off.  I just don't want to go back in September and be like 10 pounds heavier.  Especially because Leonard said "Well Vanessa before you came back you were pretty ugly, but now your hot."  I mean what if I were to gain back the 50 pounds I once lost.  What would people think of me?  Would their opinions of me change?  The truthful answer to those questions is yes.  You know I just want to be smart and pretty, really that is all I want.  I wish I weren't so self-contious, worried about weight and everything, but I mean that is what today's world is all about.  It's about being thin and hot.  That is all people care about these days, or at least it seems.  I wonder how people can be content with the way they look and the way they are.  I wish I could be, but everytime I step on the scale it's higher and makes me want to cry cause I feel like I have lost control over things in my life.  I am TRYING to eat healthy though and going to the gym all the time.  Other than that I don't know what to do, maybe I am just going through a temp gain of weight or something now.  I don't really know, I just know that I want to be back to the usual 137.  I feel ok with myself and confident at that.  I suppose it's not like being 140 is really going to make people say "omg, she gained weight" but I mean I have to keep the weight off some how.  It just doesn't make any sense though, you would think eating healthy and working out would get me somewhere.  I am more friggin active now then I was during the school days.  It doesn't make any sense.  I don't want to starve myself and I don't think that should be an option.  I am thinking maybe putting away my scale in my closet is a good idea so I don't weight myself like 4 times a day.  I need to keep away from it, and not seeing how much I weight might help with my self-concept here, but I can Physically notice changes too.  All the fat is going to my stomach, everytime I eat that is like the major fat storage area.  All my food seems to turn to fat.  My arms feel a lot muscular from weights and my legs are my more shaped.  If only there was something to make the stomach smaller.  Right now I wish I were a celebrity.  They can do anything.  I wish I were right and older.  Then I would get lipo, it's not like anyone would know you had it done.  I am scared though, if I can't keep the weight off at 16 then how I am going to manage when I have kids or when I am in my 20's and 30's.  Sometimes I think weight matter more than anything.  Your whole world practically revovles around it.  The thinner you are, the more prettier, which gives you high self-esteem and self-concept, which leads to you living a happy, successful, and productive life.  I wish I wasn't so obsessed with stuff like this, but I am and I don't know how to cope.  My Mom doesn't make it very easy since she is very overweight.  She bring home fast food (not that I eat any of it half of the time) and we always go out to here and there, she like NEEDS to buy junk when we go to movies, and compulsively she eats late.  Not to mention she buys way too much food for the house and there are always too many good options, which makes you try to resist the urge to always eat it.  She always seems to want to go get ice cream too.  I mean once and a while a treat is good, but not like every second week.  It's difficult trying to stay my weight, and I am doing my best.  I mean if I went more then 2 hours at the gym, then that would be over doing it, and I don't want to stave myself - that's just not right.  Well at least I got this off my chest.  In the morning I am going to wake up and just eat my meals, go work out, and NOT step on the scale.  This entire week we will be going out lots, so really there is no point in stepping on the scale anyways.  Once I start summer school their probably won't even be any time to eat.  Well that's that.  Wish I could be thin, but life isn't always fair so whatever comes my way I guess I just have to accept it and deal with it
