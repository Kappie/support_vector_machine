But as I sit here and wait for the last minutes of my workday to end I find that I am very anxious to leave, knowing full well I have nothing really to go home to. Tonight I am not going to visit Melissa although I am sure after an hour at home I will most likely change my mind. Lately the people in my household have been under a lot of stress and have been taking it out on everyone else and I personally don’t want to be a part of that anymore. I actually would like to be able, for one night, to come home and be able to veg-out without someone yelling at me to do something. I think that is why I like going to Melissa’s place, because I know it will be ok just to sit and do nothing, although I find I am always asking her if I can help her with anything, maybe because I know she will inevitably say no.  I had a great visit with my Niece on Wednesday and I have to say I would love to do that again with her real soon. I also got to see a few people I haven’t seen in a long time and that did me some good. I told Eileen (my old manager when I worked at the Zoo Gift Shop) that I was thinking about working on the weekends and she told me to come back in the spring and she would see what she could do for me. I don’t know if that is where I want to end up again but it’s a start.  I also start school in a week, which I cant wait for because I know that is the out I have been desperately looking for. I know it will be a big change but I need to be somewhere where learning consumes me and all I can do is focus on what I am attempting to learn.  Well, its time for me to wrap this thing up for now, quitting time, YIPPY!   But I may be back later tonight… If the spirit moves me.
