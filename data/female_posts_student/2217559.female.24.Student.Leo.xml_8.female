It is soooooooooo loud. Anyway, I got to formally meet the captain this morning and what an interesting character. He's a drunk - I mean seriously. I went in there at 10AM and he was having a scotch. Everyone smokes cigarettes in their offices. It's weird. Must be a foreign thing. Anyway, I got to see the bridge of the ship when  went to visit with the captain. It was incredible. Today, we are in Manzanillo. I haven't gone into port today because I have been kind of busy this morning. I had to give a guided tour of the ship to our port agents - about 30 hispanic people that speak no english. It was a lot of hand gestures and oooohhs and awwwss. Hehehe. It was fun though. The people were very nice and very impressed with our ship.  Tonight we have this latin dance thing in the Navigator Disco club upstairs.  Apparently, it's a huge thing for staff but I have a big day tomorrow so i don't know if I will go. I have to work unitl around 11 tonight anyway. Tomorrow night is my first formal.  Pretty exciting. I haven't figured out what I will wear just yet.   Today is discount day in the spa so I am having an hour long massage for really cheap. I am going at 3:00.  God, I remember those days at ECI when 3:00 was the kiss of death on a Tuesday - just getting out of staff meetings. THis kjob is a breeze so far. My boss - the hotel manager or "the hotman" as well call him is awesome. I went in to see him this morning and he said, "Here, sit with me for awhile."  We talked about his family, blah blah, he smoked a lot of cigarettes and said the f-word a lot. It was great. The best conversation I have ever had with a boss.   Oh yeah, we have a tranzee on board. Her name is Julianna and apparently when she was on the ship before she was a man. Guess we know what she said her money for.  She doesn't like the social hostess because the cruise master told her that they would neve rhire her for this position. Poor thing. I am nice ot her though. Hahaha.  Let's see what else. Hmm... oh we have time changes too.  Tonight we go back an hour and then tomorrow night another hour.  I am kind of confuse don what day it is and the time. This is just the most awesome job ever. It really does not feel like I am working at all. I haven't gotten sea sick yet but if i have another hangover I might. i ave felt really queesey today for sure. Maybe the massage will make it better.  Love you all - more soon.  Shell
