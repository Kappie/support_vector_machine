"companionship: relationship of friends: the company of friends and the relationship that exists between them,a person you spend a lot of time with."   "OLD USE in the past, a young woman who was paid to care for and provide friendship for an old or ill woman, especially while she was travelling" is it wrong that i want more than that?!     now that woman have 'equal rights' it seems they r the ones wearin the trousers alot more than the men- in some cases even when thay dont piticually want toI it seems guys want us to make all the desisions and all the moves- plz correct me if this is just me n my relationships but i think it sucks! it just shouldnt b so much like this!  grrrrrrrrrr!  its soo frustrating! im not sayin i want flowers and posh presants, im sayin i want 2 b made 2 feel special! if we are more than just friend then there needs 2 b a distinction btween being together and being just friends! if that doesnt make sence wel.....i dunno it makes sence 2 me n i dont care how silly it sounds! :P
