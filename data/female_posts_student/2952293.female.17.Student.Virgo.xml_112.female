FUCK NO...it is the most windy, hilly, horrible road ever! I got a headache on the way up, but I was okay. The view was pretty, but it was hot, and we stayed up there far more than I could have ever wanted. Damn these nature people. We started to head down, oh my god, it was horrible. I felt like SHIT! We had to go to the grocery store to get salmon for dinner, but I had to lie down cause I felt terrible. That night Bob and Candace came over for dinner. Let's just say the adults got a little inebriated (or in-HE-breated) and things turned a little wild and got dirty. One time Bob said to my aunt Sharon, "It tasted like your last boyfriend!" Then he was telling this story about him and his wife camping and running into a bear. Anyways, he was acting out how she was holding this flashlight towards the bear, and by the looks of his hands, it was a big flashlight. So he said, "But she's used to holding big things like this." AWKWARD! I didn't know if I was supposed to act like I knew what they meant or not. Yeah, crazy times with old people. PS this guy is in his mid 60's. Today I visited Berkeley (shut up, I know I have no chance, but my father lives on dream planet, plus I wanted to see the town and stuff) and University of San Francisco. Neither of which I liked very much. Berkeley was fucked up. You don't make appointments, you just go for the tour. Needless to say, it was their biggest tour all summer. I got this horrible tour guide. We walked around for 90 minutes, then they shoved all seven groups into this one teeny tiny classroom for the info session, which was pointless since 10% of their students make up the international and out-of-state kids. BYE. But then I had to find my aunt. Well, I left my cell phone with her and was going to call it from a pay phone. I couldn't find one, so I went back to the visitor's center to see if they had one. The guy pointed me in the right direction, and then I went to make the call. Oh, but it's $4 in change to make a long-distance call, so I was screwed. I tried calling collect, but my phone blocks that. He walked by to go to the restroom and asked me if I had found the phone. I explained my situation to him, and I asked him if I could use the school's phone to make a quick call, even though it was long-distance, but otherwise I'd be stranded. He goes, "Use our phone? Oh, no!" Long story short, I had to use my credit card to make the call, and he comes back like, "Did you figure it out?" YEAH FUCKER, I CHARGED IT. THANKS FOR NOTHING. The school has to make like a thousand phone calls a day, I'm sure they have an excellent phone plan, thanks for making your visitor feel like shit. Screw your school and all the fucked up people in what they call Beserkely. Then we drove up to USF, which was the exact opposite: private, small, Jesuit catholic. One boys mother acted like she knew so much, but she clearly knew nothing about the college process with those questions. This kid came in late and sat behind me, and his father kept talking, shut the fuck up! Then we split the very small group into two smaller ones for our tour. Okay, this was funny as hell. The guide could have cared less about the whole thing. We walked out of a building, and I kind of had my back to the door, waiting for him to walk in front of me. I turned to my right, and saw him walking the other direction, while the rest of the group was standing there with me without a clue that we were supposed to follow him to the right. This girl and her mother kept talking and pestering him. "OMG where are you from in Phoenix. AHH that's where I'm from. Do you like it here? OMG what classes are you taking?!" HEY, HE DOESN'T CARE! He looked just like a newsie, he even had on the hat. Then this HORRIBLE boy, the one that came in late, was so obnoxious I wanted to die. He asked the guide if the gym had all these different machines and weights, and the guide goes, I think his name was Robert, anyways, he goes, "Yeah, I bet we got those!" Then that young boy made some comment about old people, and the other girl's mom yelled at him and he goes, "No malice was intended." Okay, you want to sound smart so you use big words. No, you just sounded stupid trying to say something that simple with big words. Jackass. Oh, and his father was a trip. The boy said something to his mother, who didn't respond, and his dad goes, "Melinda, he was talking to you!" How about Melinda pushed that brat out of her crotch, therefore she'll ignore him any time of the day she wants tubby! Then my aunt Sharon and I drove over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito and then came down to Union Square, where we spent an hour trying to find parking, found a 30-minute meter, and then found all the stores to be closed. Tomorrow we're driving up to Napa Valley. PS she's driving me crazy- but I'll make an entry dedicated to every annoying thing she does later.
