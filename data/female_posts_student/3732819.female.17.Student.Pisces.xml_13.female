But its here FOR the public to read anyways.  So heres my situation. I'm torn. As I always am. Too many thoughts. Okay I know this is stupid, and I'm simply going to tell you now that this is mostly about boys. Okay the situation is this, I do have a boyfriend, and his name is Brendan, I met him through one of my very good friends Laura, which I am without a doubt very thankful for. Me and him have been going out for about 5 months now, 6 coming up...then 7...then 8....okay well i'm sure you get the point, well anyways there is a slight problem with me, and that is that i get tired of boys VERY easily, which explains why my longest realtionship is the one right now, and before this one, my longest relationship was 3 months. Its just me, I need to be constantly entertained, so which is why i either get annoyed of the boy or i just plain and simple am tired of him. Now this happened to most of my ex boyfriends, well actually lets go through them  Andrew - first boyfriend, stiff (but we were young), total sweetheart(gave me a ring:)), still friends with now, slowly gaining a crush on him...but we'll get into that later Andy - got bored of, total sweetie, turned into a pot head though Raf - i'm not even going to start with him, he is one in a million and also a guy who i still love dearly *muah*  Chris - sweetie, got bored of..., and another long story to it Shane - omg, my black man, love him to death, but i wasn't being fair to him, Tyler - oh tyler, lol got bored of him by a month and a half, sweet and a little heartless Brendan - my current bf, surprisingly i'm not really tired of him...just tired of the stupid shit that he does all the time which gets incrediably fustrating all the time cause he's gotten to the point where his only thing to say is "i'm sorry"  So those are all the exboyfriends, now for the past few months, i've gotten to know a few boys, some more than others. I'll start off with the simpler, less complicated boys. Uh Mark, oh Mark *sniiiiffffff* YUMMY! does he ever smell YUM! but yeah, he's more of like a "friend with benefits" I actually met him through Brendan, cause i went to a retreat with him at his camp and its was a Christan camp, i am NOT a churchy god this god that sorta person, so i was a little bored till i met mark, who was forced to go to this camp deal-o so me and him got to talking and since the retreat back in February we still keep in touch. Go down to see him occassionally. Yes Brendan wasn't a fan of him, probably cause he knew taht Mark was "my type" of guy... and then we got a few other ones that linger in my mind from time to time, like Mike, Cisco, Marek, those are other ones that i won't really get into at the moment cause they aren't my majour problem yet, their my little crushes, some which i like more than the others.  But theres one guy that stands out to ALL the guys i've EVER dated...whom i have known for 3 years, 4 years soon. To me and most of my friends he is known as "My Dream Boy - Matt" now...i've known him since i was in grade 9, and i am in grade 11 going into grade 12 now, and we still talk. Now when i was younger and more stupid when i met Matt i used to have a list of my "dream boy" which consisted of (Blonde hair, blue eyes, six pack, tattoo, piercing, ACCENT...) and the list goes on and on and on and when i was younger Matt fit every little part of that, and from that point on we always talked all the time, but unfortuantly for a period of time we stopped talking, more so because i was being a little bit of a bitch and didn't wanna talk to him cause he had a gf, so i was playing jealous...yes i was young and stupid leave me alone! Oh oh, see i forgot this one part, HE LIVES IN FUCKING ENGLAND!  yes...my dream boy....my dream boy since i was 13 is in fucking England! So anyways yes, we just kinda talked all the time on the mic and what not, i was ALWAYS happy to see him when he came online, back then and even now, he is the highlight of my day when i get to talk to him.  So for the past year and a bit, my feelings for him are growing stronger and stronger, i know this sounds bad and whatever, but i find that i'm more in love with Matt then i am with my own boyfriend, as a matter of fact i don't love my boyfriend, i take love quite seriously, i don't say it unless i mean it, and i honestly mean it when i say to Matt that i love him, but i don't think he exactly realizes that at all. He says it too, but in my eyes i'm just thinking, blah whatever he's just saying that to me cause i said it to him. But yeah, i care about this kid so much, and i know it sounds stupid cause i met him over the net and what not, but i'm truly getting stronger feelings for this guy. Like he sends me text messages whenever he gets home from work which is at 6am...and i dunno....like we talk more and more often...i think about him quite a lot even when we're not talking on the internet, which is why i have spent 15 minutes writting about my dream boy. And i dunno what to do, he tells me that he's going to come down to Canada and visit me...actually he promised me many times that he would come down and visit me, and i feel stupid cause i'm actually believing him...but should i be feeling stupid? i certaintly hope not...i care about him so much, more than he would ever realize. *sighs* i keep all his text messages on my cell, so if i'm having a shitty day i just read them and i smile... Anyways yeah...i dunno what to do with him...i like him a lot...as a matter of fact i love him...i duno what to do!
