You know, the time when "too cool for school" is more  an expression of nostalgia than any kind of literal threat.  Of course, it's not true. I'm 26 and I feel like I still run into a lot of slit-eyed, raised eyebrow "You're doing/wearing/drinking/buying/living in/reading/listening to [blank].... RIGHT?"  I can only be so counter-fabulous!  While there is nothing better I love than to regale the hipper-than-thou with my non-ironic love for  urlLink Jodeci  and R. Kelly, as well as my for-real ownership and heavy-rotation of at least one J. Lo CD (my friend and neighbor Nicole likes to tease me about when she had to ask me to turn down the Beyonce), sometimes it is tiring and dull.  I thought this was the whole point of graduating high school.  Anyhow, this is all just a preamble to: has anyone else noticed this whole "Tuesday is the new Saturday" thing?  It comes up in today's  urlLink Gothamist interview  but I have heard it enough other places that I am definitely sniffing out a sneaky trend.    So, what?  Now only the  urlLink mythic Frat Boy  goes out on Saturday night?  And those that are truly down are staying home renting  urlLink Donnie Darko  or whatever?    See and be seen in the middle of the week!  I guess it's hardcore to be hungover at work.  Now, don't get me wrong:  I am all for going out whenever the hell you feel like it.  It's the "only losers go out on Saturdays" (I have also heard Fridays) thing that bugs me.  However, my being bugged is imediately eclipsed by my amusement of people staying home and congratulating themselves for how fucking fabulous they are for NOT being at the bar.  I don't think your coolness counts if no one can see you.  But that's okay, whatever.  Maybe I'm just a little   urlLink Tony Manero  but I will be out if I feel like it, and I'll pour a little out for yas.   [By the way, when I did a Google search for "frat boy" a juxtaposed image of Bush and Saddam turned up as one of the results. Interesting...]
