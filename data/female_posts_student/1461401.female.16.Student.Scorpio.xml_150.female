I didn't end up going to the library again like I had planned, but I think (hope) I'll be ok. I stuck around after school for a while to hang out with tracy and cassie and amanda and kristina and tylor and joe. That was fun. Now I'm drinking tea... or at least, waiting for it to cool down.  Oh, did I just waste your time?  Oops...
