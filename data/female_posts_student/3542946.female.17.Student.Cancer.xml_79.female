Is Latham advocating democratising further Australia? Is he suggesting more public control over industry and resources? Is he suggesting a process of reinvigoration? Are his policies going to make a major change in Australia. Or will it be as Naomi Klein has said. Latham in Kerry in, the nback to work. Acoording to her it will be alot easier to work for a change in the system when people are over their personal dislike for leaders. When the gross mutations that are produced by the system and are supposed to represent us are replaced by someone that is a more pure manifestation will we change? Will society change. Will we become communities? Will we have the power or will we be happy and go back to our lives now that Bush and Howard are out of power?  To paraphrase an article in Adbusters, if Kerry gets in when the next war comes you will either be with him or against him. In Australia its more complex than that. Latham will get our troops out of Iraq but we will stay involved in the dubious 'war on terror', Pine gap will stay and there is no objection by Latham to any 'joint training bases' in northern australia. The Labor party has also passed the FTA, backflipped and increased the PBS co-payments, banned gay marriage, and finally and most damning will retain the policy of mandatory detention.
