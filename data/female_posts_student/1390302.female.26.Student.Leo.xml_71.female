I am reading a book  The 38 most common fiction writing mistakes (And how to avoid them)  by Jack M. Bickham and I’ve come to the realization that my procrastination in writing, my fear of writing, my confusion about weather I’m ready to write, is all rather irrelevant if I do indeed intend to be a writer.  If I do, then I should begin to write, and forget the rest, its unimportant.  So, that is what I have decided I am going to do.    I am going to try to treat my writing like a job.  Work on it 4 hours or more a day and write down my hours.  That way I can see how often I am writing and for how long, it will also help me to keep writing.  Everyday I am going to write, and maybe some on the weekends, maybe.  I am going to try to start writing seriously.    One of my major apprehensions is that I am terrible at grammar.  I feel like I just don’t have the education to write professionally.  I suppose we shall see.  I have to overcome the fear and the angst at writing.  The only way to do that is to write.    So I, as of yet, have no idea what I intend to write.  I just know that I am going to.  Maybe I’ll start doing the writing prompts from Writer’s digest.  I got a calendar with writing prompts on every day of the year, from Writer’s Digest Book Club.  It’s really nice, so I am going to start using it, I think.  I also have several good books, including  The Writer’s Idea Workshop    The Writer’s Idea Book  both by Jack Hefferon.  They are full of writing prompts for every day of the learning experience.  I really believe that most of my problem stems from the fact that I am not the most patient person.  I don’t want to be an aspiring writer I just want to be a writer.  However, rationally, I realize that I have to an aspiring writer first.  It’s a progression of things, the life process of learning to be a writer, and writing a novel, short story, article, whatever.   I am also tired of being in college.  I’m 26 years old and I’m barely through with half of my associate’s degree.  Matt and I are intending to go to a 4-year college soon, but I just want to graduate.  Several of my friends from high school, with whom I no longer have any contact due to very unpleasant circumstances - have graduated from college.  My ex-husband has his master’s degree already, and his sisters are even graduated from college, and they’re several years younger than I am.  It’s very discouraging.   So I have to breath in and out, and control my impatience.  All the patience I have will pay off someday.  For someday I will write a novel, wish me luck!  ~Kristyn
