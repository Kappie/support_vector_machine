It was hard saying goodbye, because it felt like as soon as you got to know everyone, you had to leave. That part really sucked. All us Redeemer kids got a group picture in front of the Shetek sign. It'll probably be really good. All of us girls got up at 4:30 this morning to take warm showers, blow dry our hair, put on makeup, and dress up cute and pack. Well, we couldn't blow dry our hair by the mirrors because we couldn't wake anyone up, so we went into the kitchen. Well, Jenn and I started drying our hair for like 20 seconds when a fuse went out. Then we switched outlets, and I finished drying my hair, and so did Jenn, and then the fuse blew out again on Candace. It sucked, and we couldn't fix it, or tell anyone because it was like 5:00 in the morning. Then we found more outlets and finished. Someone must have fixed the fuse thingy because we had light in the ktichen by breakfast.  After that we did our makeup (in the dark) and that was a different experience and packed in the dark. Then we got dressed and ate breakfast. After that we had Wisdom of the Elders, and then it was time to leave. We all said good-bye for like 30 minutes, and then took our picutres and left. Then we drove to Omaha. Once we got there we were assuming we were meeting their youth group (that was why we got all cute looking) and the lady told us they weren't coming. It was kindaa let down but it was allright. Then we just went on walks and talked and stuff. It was pretty cool.   After that, Me, Amez, Nicki, Mr. Bill, Joel, and Candace went to Wal-Mart. I spent 20 dollars on Propel water and magazines and fruit snacks. -lol- Then we went to look for a bookstore and almost got lost. On the way home, we were all talking about Bertha, and we got so caught up and mad that someone made a rule that if you didn't have the water bottle, you couldn't talk. So when Nicki was talking, she goes "i'm sorry to be blunt, but i've been dying not being able to tell anyone, so here it goes..." and she goes "when we got to our bunks, i climbed up top, and as i was sitting up there i hear Bertha say something like i've roomed with girls before, so we all have the same parts, so nicki looks over and sees her butt nacked, and then Nicki goes, Whoaa,, I don't even know you name yet! and then she tells all of us that apparently bertah doesn't believe in shaving south of the belly button, and that she looks like a jungle. Then joel goes, "it's like an ingrown fro". Then Nicki goes "it looks like shurbbery!" Mr. Bill was about to die from laughing so hard. Anyway, once we got back to the church, we all play fought with Twizzlers which hurt really hard if you get popped with them by the way. Then we went to bed. The End.  Liz
