Sadder: I actually beat 4.8% of the people time-wise. The fact that I beat anyone is just really bad (as in I shouldn't have played long enough to beat even 4.8%)  even sadder: when I let go the record came up, and it was like eleven days and something. ELEVEN DAYS! doesn't that make you sad for that person. It makes me sad.
