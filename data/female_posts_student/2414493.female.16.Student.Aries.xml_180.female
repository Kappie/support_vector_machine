I think I've seen a glimmer of home--anatomy won't be so terrible next year. Everything I just associate with it is so warm and fuzzy right now: I love Jean to bits, hands down. Bret reminded me what a miserable year I was going to have next year. Select adventures with a bottle of Sprite and very bearable anatomy comrades. Perhaps I owe it to being able to drive, but life isn't bad at all.  My lips are all red from being sick and my nose is raw from all the rubbing. Lovely.   I think we're going to have a journalism dinner, which is reassuring since I think I'm going with AA to bring the cadavers back to Loma Linda on Wednesday, which happens to be the journalism seniors' last day. I think this class was the one group I really got along with, and it's sad to see them leave. I guess the higher you go up in grade level, the more you miss your seniors. A dinner would be perfect fun, and a good way to say goodbye.  And mock trial dinner too, for sure.   I can't believe all this is winding down. I fear extreme movement right now, it's funny. As if my light gestures could keep this kind of nostalgic rinse on me forever.
