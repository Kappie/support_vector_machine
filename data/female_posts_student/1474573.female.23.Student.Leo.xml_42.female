My knowledge of spanish was limited to the lyrics that Celia sang to me and of course the lyrics of Mi Tierra by Gloria Estefan I've probably only met one Cuban person in my life but the histoire of la Carribean flowed in me  in intangibles only heard through  Mambo Kings Afro Cuban All stars and boleros as old as my grandfather When you're raised inside a  custody battle between three languages creole the language of struggle and of survival french the language of my colonizers english the language of my present and my future learning spanish wasn't much of a priority because sometimes things not said aren't things not learned  Rythms spoke more volumes about  pain and longing and history and struggle  thank you celia
