I had a great weekend, overall, except for some minor tiffs here and there. The most fun was Happy Hour, where me and some cool law students (as to be differentiated from the NON-cool law students) ran back and forth from Dorsey's to the Tusk drinking. It was such a motley group of people, which made it all the better. I love hanging out with people who are fun. I love finding out that people are more fun than you thought. Had a semi-fight with MH. He is a very immature person, and I'm not going to sweat it about him anymore. Going to have fun with both him and EK and not think twice about it. My theory is, MH doesn't care about me enough as much as he should, and EK cares about me more than I deserve. So, there you have it! My theory! I guess I could stop this, and I might, but I might not. I don't feel that I'm necessarily wronging anyone but myself, because neither one of them care about me like I needed to be cared for, anyway. So, so, so...I have nothing else to say. I should clean or do some homework or something...I might. It's not really an option, only a question of when the hell should I go up and get my books (they're at school), since it has proceeded to SNOW in the waning days of March. WTF? Anyway, later, gators.
