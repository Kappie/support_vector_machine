I know that this one comes DIRECTLY after my other one, but the funny thing about that is that i really hate first things.  but it's over with and now, um, i guess i can ramble.  another funny thing... now there's nothing to ramble about.  okay. LAST DAY OF SCHOOL.  it's over and done with.  i survived junior year with relatively few mishaps and all that.  yay for all of you who are in excal and yay for my festival buddies.  oughta be a party.  i am in denial about the end of school.  it's not that i am not happy about this or something, but the thing is that i feel like i ought to be going back on monday.  freaksome.  blah blah blah there isn't anything truly amusing to be writing about.  http://www.babycenter.com/general/6742.html  go there.  read the lyrics.  carefully.  it is SO weird.  and they sing this song to children?  i am surprised that so few children suffer from trauma because of this song.  anywho.  i feel done.  very done.
