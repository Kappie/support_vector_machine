The clear isn't exactly clear, you have still see the silver wire that connects the braces together. I am so indesive!  i like the clear...and I like the gold! and I like the colors! Hmm  I am talking to Sara from Inhabited on instant messenger!!! How COOOL!!!! :) She rocks my socks offfff!  I am leaving in about 20 minutes and I wont be back till 8:30 :( Even later if Matt stops at krispy kreme...he is quite addicted!  My hands are all sticky from the orange I just ate..i'm going to go wash them!
