He was all nice and everything during grad and I was so tempted to ask him out. SO tempted, but the practical part of me made me stop myself, because I knew that he'd probably say no. I doubt he's interested in me in THAT way, because there are hundreds of other prettier girls in the school that he could have...Well, In that statement I'm kinda assuming unfairly that he is shallow enough to care that much about looks, but still... I'm disappointed at the prospect of a long summer without him, but I guess I'll have to move on, and keep going without him. I hate this SO much. I can't even explain how I feel. I guess heartbroken and utterly disappointed. I realise that I'm really dramatic and emotionally intense so I'm probably making everything 20 times worse for myself, but I can't handle this...
