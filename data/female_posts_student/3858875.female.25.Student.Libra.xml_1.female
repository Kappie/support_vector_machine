My supervisors think i'm almost there.  this long weekend will be one last weekend of overachievement (which is why, of course, i spent the a.m. in bed). i'm to have a new revised draft in by tuesday. I also have to get my images sorted and get permissions from the artists to use any of their quotes and images.  our department has moved to a pass/fail system as well, which takes a lot of pressure off - b/c i'm the type to fret about whether i score an 86 or 88, or whatever.
