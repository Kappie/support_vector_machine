I miss hearing his voice and seeing him and holding him and kissing and loving him. I miss everything about him. I miss coming home and finding him glued to the computer, or asleep on the couch. I miss eating meals with him and walking to Rite-Aid with him. I miss riding our bikes to the grocery store and having to cart all of our groceryâ€™s home. I miss sleeping on the couch with him next to me. I miss soaking in the bathtub with him sitting next to the tub, just talking to me. I miss our little barbeques and how when we were in our bed, how my cat would try to sleep between us. I miss playing video games with him, or just even watching Dune for the umpteen times and me falling asleep halfway through it. I miss our walk by the riverfront and having Jesse behind me holding me nice and tight.   I know if I had more time to think, or just the energy to think, I would probably be able to come up with a millions different things I miss about Jesse, but for some reason I am really tired right now.
