Tampa Bay won last night 4-1, now the series is tied up! I rubbed it into Steven Danby's face today and he told me that the only reason i'm going for Tampa is because Vincent Lecavalier is hott.  I could not deny this, its true.  Hey but thats what i do after Dallas gets eliminated, find a team with the hottest guys and cheer for them all the way. its not my fault that dallas can't win lol.  ok so yesterday on the pre-game thing, they showed these black and white picture of Vinny and they interviewed him!!!  He is sooooo hott, he has really nice arm muscles and his hair is adorable.  Martin St. Louis is soooo adorable!!!  Big brown eyes and he's sooo short!!  Reminds me so much of David Ciminelli.....i swear they look like they could be related and they play with the same style also.  In other news, my dear Niko Kapanen made it onto Team Finland for the World Cup of Hockey '04.  It was very exciting! He's also playing with Jere Lehtinen and Riku Hahl, his best friend!! I can't wait until August, they're airing all the games on ESPN!!!  Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: this is the last one kids, because now he's graduating or whatever.  He ended the year with a good note, he wore a matching outfit.  Yay for him, i wish him the best of luck with color coordination in college lol. Lauren, i think we have done our job, he finally got the message lol.  alright, i gotta go get ready to party it up with the gang at Kendra's!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
