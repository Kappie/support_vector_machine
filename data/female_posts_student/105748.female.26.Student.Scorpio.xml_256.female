Ching, I don't know if I already told you, but  Hedwig and the Angry Inch  is out on video. I saw it in the new release section at Hollywood Video. With all the activity that's going on, I'm not sure if you have any leisure time to do any reading. But I do have a few recommendations if you're interested. How far are you coming along w/ the wedding plans?   How was everyone's holidays? Any good stories or presents to mention?
