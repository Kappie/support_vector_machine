But throughout the day, it goes away. Although, for the past few days, my chest has been really tight (which hurts) and that  hasn't gone away.  I thought I might just be getting sick. But I was telling Carly about it and she told me it's probably from my asthma and all the running at soccer conditioning. So that's just dandy.  My asthma is making me sick.  Or feel like it at least. Today I finished Lord of the Flies. Personally,  I think it totally sucked.  The ending was so bad. After everything that happened in the book, it's like, " That's all? " Kristina, if you're reading this, I'll go to her house this weekend and give you the book. Now I just gotta read Tom Sawyer. I'm hoping it's better than LOTF. Then I finished my Seventeen magazine. Did some crunches, went online, ate ice cream (first time I've ate junk food in 2 weeks and 5 days so I think you know why), and just got ready for soccer. I didn't wanna go  at all.  I was seriously about to curl up in a ball and cry. I was in such pain. But I went anyways thinking the running would help. So we did our warm up mile. Also didn't walk. God, I'm getting good at this! Did our crazy sprints and line exercises, wasn't too bad. I think it was better today because I started carrying my inhaler as I ran those. I didn't wanna carry it during the mile because if I needed to use it, I'd have to stop and I didn't wanna stop. See? Will power! (wink, wink!) Then we did the ladder with the cones which means a  LONG  break so we were all happy! Plus, I actually like the cone ladder for your information. After that we played keep away for a little bit. I think allthis conditioning is actually working already. See during keep away, I think I did really good. Then we did degressions. No cool down mile!! YAY! And because we worked so hard (I don't think it was a really tough day of practice though) we don't have practice tomorrow.  So I'm all smiles about that!  I came home, watered flowers, and now I'm here. I was in a bad mood before but I think I'm better!  YaY!
