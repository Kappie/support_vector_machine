Even a lie can become true. My words of today (my truth) For certain one day Will be detached from reality Mutating is the key. To grow and evolve To learn how to live For the best we can get Today I’m me This way you see This way you read Tomorrow I’ll be me Thought a different me Some things never change Some remain enclosed Protected from time erase Like a precious treasure Those little things are my guide So I don’t loose myself from me Reminding each day my essence The one which turns me unique Memories only mine.
