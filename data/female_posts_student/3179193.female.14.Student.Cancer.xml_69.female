Oh well... if I don't like it, I'll just wash my hair again to straighten it out.   Hungry~ Hee hee~ Feel like having chips. Nah... bad for me. I'm such a junk food addict... with a sweet tooth too! You can obviously tell by my passion for chocolate ice-cream with chocolate chips topped with chocolate sauce. Yummy~ I need to buy chocolate sauce to go with my chocolate ice-cream and chocolate chips. Hee heezZ~! You can tell I love CHOCOLATE too! But you know what (or should I say WHOM) I love more than chocolate? NIMA~ That's right! ^^   Walked home with Nima and he said he'd call. Still hasn't. Blah, it's all good. He's doing homework, probably. History notes due tomorrow~! PhewiezZ~!   Wow, I killed my fingers badly yesterday, trying to learn the chords for BEHIND BLUE EYES. >O  Speaking of guitar, I met a guy on Friendster who also has a passion for music, especially the guitar. He messaged me and asked me to add him since we both like guitars. Coolness eh? Power of FRIENDSTER~! ^^ I added Nima's pic into my gallery in Friendster. Only Nima's grad pic though. :P   I miss him. Blah. So tired... taking a break. Blog later... maybe.
