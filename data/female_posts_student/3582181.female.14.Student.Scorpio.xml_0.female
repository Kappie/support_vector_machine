Feels like forever Within my heart are memories Of perfect love that you gave to me Oh, I remember   When you are with me, I'm free I'm careless, I believe Above all the others we'll fly This brings tears to my eyes My sacrifice    Your a Fruitcake...   Ima sittin in my chair twiddling my thumbs....actually i dont think i have thumbs. Im waiting for the chicken lord to come down and bless me by taking me into his haven. He's late again.  I wonder what people would think if they saw this blog-a-licious blog. They'd probably think I was high.  I wish...  I had Mr. watsis name come to see me today, he spoke bout getting high and dying. And drinking and dying. And smoking and dying.  Looootsa dying Quite depressing, if there hadnt been dancing circus bears in my hallucinations at the time.
