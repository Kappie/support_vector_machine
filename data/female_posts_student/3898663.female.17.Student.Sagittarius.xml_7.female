They went on a 4 day vacation to the coast and left me here alone, and I told them to leave me AT LEAST 3/4 of a gallon of milk...I should have known...They didn't. I got a grand total of a little less than half. Arg. I'm mad, and I have to go to the store and buy milk and bread and that makes me angry...GRRR!!!  Meh.
