His video for Musicology was on the Soul music-video channel, and it hit me that I had the chance to go and see this wonderful musician who I love and it's his LAST TOUR and he's gonna be RIGHT HERE at the Key Arena.... and I'm gonna be sitting at home. Not there. AND I HAVE BEATLE HAIR. How could things get worse. And I think I'm getting sick. I'm considering getting highlights. Or get a purple or pink streak. Or shaving it all off. Sexy.
