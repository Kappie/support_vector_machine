Sudden, brief nirvana. And many thanks to however this happened. It's just been a crazy day.   I went to bed early last night with that stomachache and thought ok, I'll get my six hours and wake up around 3. Didn't happen, but I don't think you even needed to guess. Physio: we hyperventilate and get dizzy and breathe into paper bags. "SUCK IT HARDER, LYDIA!" says Bowman. I think I'm the only one who doesn't get it until J brought it up again in history. Nigel can't stop laughing. Besides suspicious activities with the ruler, I think he's just about the best lab partner ever. And the funniest thing: he's going to do anatomy if he gets in, so I guess the rest of us--Wendy, Sabrina, Nimo, Erum and I--will do it too. All I have to do now is cross my fingers and hope that at least one of them end up in my lab group.  But this "everything's going to be ok" act will take a little more convincing. It's already 5:41. I just came home and ate and took care of some recycling bin business and vocab, and here I am now. I'm going to record Ravel tonight and see if the microphone will be a little more sensitive to dynamic contrast in the Bach. Ravel actually didn't sound so bad, but it needs to be cleaner, as always. I have a few math homeworks to do. Hey, I don't want to complain, but I wish I could just get school over with and go out on the weekends instead of having to stress over competitions and journalism and soreness, among other things. Junior year hurts.   And I still have to write that column for B. Hm.
