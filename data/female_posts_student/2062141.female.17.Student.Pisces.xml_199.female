We light our lamps  For atmosphere  And hang our hopes  On chandeliers  We're going long  We're gaining weight  We're sleeping long  And far too late  And so it's times  To change our ways  But I've loved these days.   Now as we indulge  In things refined  We hide our hearts  From harder times  A string of pearls  A foreign car  Oh we can only go so far  On caviar and Cabernay.   We drown our doubts  In dry champage  and soothe our souls  with fine cocaine  I don't know why i ever care  We'll get so high  And get nowhere  We'll have to change our jaded ways,...  But i've loved these days.   So before we end  And then begin  we'll drink a toast to how it's been  a few more hours to be complete  a few more nights on satin sheets  A few more times that I can say,..  I've loved these days   -Billy Joel
