April treats me like a little kid. hello??? im 17! im old enough to go on patrols. plus im a potential slayer...and she could fill me in now and then but she doesnt...freak...the wiccans are always busy meditating and all. i could help with the research. or maybe the slayage. anything to keep me busy...just as long as they dont give me the polishing weapons deal again...
