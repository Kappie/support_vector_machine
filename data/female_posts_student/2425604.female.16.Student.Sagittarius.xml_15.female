Just because the moment was heated doesn't mean that I wanted to fight, and even though I saw your anger, even though I saw your face, the words that you cited were chosen, not thinked, not spoken in haste. All on you and me. All on you and me.  Just for the moment, just one more time, just one more second and we'll be just fine, this could be just, be just in case it's the last time. Just for the moment, Just one more time, Just one more second and we'll be just fine, This could be the last time...  Just until sundown, just one more day I could hold you, that I could hold you, Just until sundown, just one more day I could hold you, without you, pushing me away. All on you, And me.     how i feel rite now :-(
