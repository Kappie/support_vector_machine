Guess we'll just have to figure out other ways of spreading my, and others', brilliance around via the blog universe.  My idea was that I could create a page with a bunch of my other writings and kick ass images from the boy, assuming he'd want the advertising, but our stuff is far too valuable and of such greater quality than the AOL member homepage designs that I won't subject the material to such squalor.  So there!  Suppose I could just post my other writings a paragraph at a time on my "daily" entries.  That means you're screwed hon, sorry!
