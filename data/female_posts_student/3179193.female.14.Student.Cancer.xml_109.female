Well, I'll do what I can but yeah. I was just talking to him about his nickname to make sure he ain't cheating on Alicia. LOL~! I'm such a weirdo.   I think I woke up a little. More awake than asleep. I'm tempted to go back to bed but I'm waiting for Nima's call back after dinner so I'm talking to Park. :P   Daddy called just now. Hehe~ Talking on the phone. So bored.  Well, watched that episode of Newly Weds/Punk'd again and Park just got offline. *sighzZ* I don't know what to doooo... high school. Grr...  It's so friggin hot right now... jeez, I'm wearing a tanktop-ish undershirt-ish thing and its still so freakin hot. Grr... My long jammies pants are NOT helping either. *sighzZ* Goshnameh.   Guitar lessons tomorrow. Ew. I'll have to see Nathan and Caleb and Timothy and Joseph again. Well, I guess Nathan isn't that bad. Talked to him at church on Sunday outside and it was just... blah. I think he's going out with Katie. Cool. Caleb... he seems like a Nathan-wannabe but he's still cool... Joseph's just messed and Timothy's a nice guy. Knew him since grade 5 I think? Whatever. So yeah. Probably doing Rhinestone Cowboy again. It's a cool song though. So yeah...   I've tried speaking less Cantonese with my Chinese bros around Nima. Sorry if I accidently do it sometimes... I'm trying.  Blah... so hot. Gonna lay down and talk on the phone. :P
