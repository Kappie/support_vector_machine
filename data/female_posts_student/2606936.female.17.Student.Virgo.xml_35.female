Having often been advised to do realllllly weird things, i was skeptical, but she got me to try it. What you do is, fill a glass with water and drink from the opposite side. I don't mean, turn it around. I mean, basically you have nto have your chin inside the cup. It's awkward, but the slurping calms down the spasms of the diaphragm. The water probably shouldn't be too cold either.  This has worked excellently for me since then. It's awesome and also makes a funny story.  That being said, it ain't working now. Hopefully I won't end up like that guy who had them for like two years.  Anyone got a better cure for the hiccups?
