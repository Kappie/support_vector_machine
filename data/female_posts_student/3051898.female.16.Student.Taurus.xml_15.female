Laura reckons I told him because I'm jealous of her, and she convinced Chris of that (I have now told him otherwise, I hope he believes my side of the story). Laura has calmed down since I think, but she still seems sorta mad. She gives me the impression that she does like him quite a bit. I'll admit I would be a LOT happier if they stopped being in contact with each other, but that won't happen unless they get bored of each other... which could take forever to happen (but is much more likely to happen if they don't see each other in person). By the way, my atemp to stop talking about Chris has failed. I now find myself hoping someone else will bring him up so I can talk about him, or else I just bring him up anyway. I think I have improved very slightly, as everyone else was talking about him. No noticable changes, though... I'll keep trying. Today it was brmb's party in the park. Lots of music artists were at cannon hill park basically. I went with Lauren, Louise, Chris and Louise's mom. It rained. A lot. Some of the music was good, though. I liked Mark Owen and Sugababes... Nelly Furtado and McFly were quite good, too. I'm convinced that it was Ronan Keating who made it rain cuz he sucks (Mark Owen made it stop cuz he's great). Actually I also liked Sam and Mark... Now the part you know I want to talk about where I mention Chris. A lot of the time he was talking to Lauren,  which I did my best to ignore... he also hugged her (twice!) and not me (if he can get away with hugging her why can't he get away with hugging me??). He did carry me lots so that I could see the stage better cuz I'm so short...that was sweet of him. Except he also picked up Lauren, and she could see anyway. At the time I was fine with this, but later after discussing it I now feel pretty shit. Also after reading Lauren's blog she mentions him quite a bit, why does she feel she needs to say so much about him? She didn't even mention the music! Doesn't she realise it only makes me think about it more and more and feel worse? I'm not angry or anything like that... I just feel sad. Lauren thought I was fine with everything, but I was actually trying to make excuses to reassure myself and also I was hoping she would change subject... okay so I sortof do want to talk about it, but only if it's going to make me feel happy, which it doesn't. Actually, I was pretty happy with today until I thought about everything he did with Lauren. Why did he hug her? If he's not allowed to hug me in front of his mom why would he be allowed to hug her? Also why did he pick up Lauren? I mean before I thought about it and discussed it I was a bit unhappy, but I tried not to overthink it... because he had just been saying I was heavy and I said Lauren was heavier it was like he was testing this out to find out how much heavier and how long he could carry her for, which made sense at the time. Lauren told me he kept asking if she could see though and that she thinks this could mean he wanted to carry her. I hadn't thought of that. I assumed he was asking because I couldn't see and he was just sorta wondering if she could see or not. See in most situations I would assume I'm right, but what she says makes sense and so concernes me. There's no reasonable explaination for the hugs. Lauren says they were just messing aroud hugs, but still the point remains that she got 2 hugs without really wanting them and I asked for a hug and I got none. I can understand why I got none, but I can't understand why she got 2. Ok I should stop now. It's not fair, I'm going to think about this more and more and then while I try to get to sleep it'll be worse (it always is - i think too much in bed) and so I won't be able to get to sleep and make myself depressed and tomorrow I'll probably be moody. Guess I'm not gonna stop afterall. In fact I could go on abuot this all day. Maybe it'll get it out of my system, though I doubt it. Thinking about it Chris wasn't that nice to me today actually. He made fun of the way I eat, the way I drink and my height. He talked to Lauren more than me, hugged her and not me, and picked her up for no apparent reason. Ok, really I've probably said enough now... I've probably pissed Lauren off by writing this stuff (I don't mean to...it's just the way I feel). I'm gonna end by pointing out to Lauren that no, she does not act like she dislikes Chris AT ALL! So therefore yes, you could act like you dislike him more because you actually act like you like him. You act closer than to him than I do for goodness sake... I realise me saying this will make you angry... I dunno it just does annoy me sometimes when you claim you don't like him but when you're around him you NEVER act like it. Perhaps really you do like him but don't want to admit it for fear of me becoming paranoid (as I do get VERY paranoid as I'm sure you can tell from today). If that's the case too late. Ok, I'm not saying I think he fancies you or you fancy him... just it wouldn't surprise me.  I doubt you have a reasonable explaination to calm my nerves, so I'm left panicking and assuming and worrying. It's horrible. It's times like this I really hate being me.  Lauren, I'm sorry I posted this. I've said things that will annoy you, no doubt. I suppose I created this blog for my feelings, I didn't create it for you to get offended or annoyed by, so please try not to be. I've probably exaggerated it on here anyway. I'm just gonna go and be miserable somewhere and hope that I find something else to think about while I'm trying to sleep (I CAN'T clear my mind - just doesn't work - being stuck in my head is like HELL at times... count yourself lucky you don't have my thoughts).  Bye for now ~Hannie xxx  P.S. I'm also sorry for being overly repetitive and probably not making what my point is clear. In fact it would probably be best to ignore the post completely.
