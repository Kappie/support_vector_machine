Oh, if you're bored have a sandwhich with marmite and coleslaw *i dunooo!* it's soo nice! Well I like it, every one else think's that it's gross. It sooo isn't! Mine you, I do like weird stuff. Mmm... I had a craving for twiglets in history, not that's weird seeing as I kind of don't like twiglets that much. Any way help SMEE! My parents want me to make another cake and they're making me cut out aprons! AAARGH! (Hey, don't complain, you're getting paid to cut out aprons) ... Oh yeah so I am. Ah heck, now I have nothing to complain about. Oh, apart from Lynne told the person who was gonna ask out Anna that she doesn't want to go out with him seeing as he kept arranging it and then never turning up. (Who wants it arranged any way? People just either get embarrassed or obsessed. I mean helooo, not good!) *silence* Ahh heck, don't say heloo back, you might excite it. (It?) You. The thing that happens to be by my head. (Oh. Your other head?) Yup. Brown to the roots guys! I better go ...find some thing to do. Bubisi.
