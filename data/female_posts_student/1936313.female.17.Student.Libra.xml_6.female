I think I finally managed to run myself down so much that I got sick.. -waits for all the 'I told You so's'- yeayea.. I realize i'm an idiot... headache, chills, lightheaded... and this unending feeling of exhaustion that I feel all the way through my bones..it makes it hard to make any effort move...  I think part of that is the lack of iron I've been taking -waits for the rest of the I-told-you-so's- Alright... lesson learned... Now I really must go back to suffering....and praying I'm better by Thursday.. being sick on an airplane isn't nice... I know... been there already......Adios...or something
