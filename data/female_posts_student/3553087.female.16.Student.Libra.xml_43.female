Am I just running in place? If I stumble and I fall Should I get up and carry on or will it all just be the same  'Cause, I'm young and hopeless I'm lost and I know this I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say I'm troublesome, I've fallen I'm angry at my father It's me against this world and I don't care, I don't care  No one in this industry understands the life I lead When I sing about my past it's not a gimmick not an act These critics and these trust fund kids Try to tell me what punk is but when I see them on the streets they got nothing to say!  And if I make it thru today will tomorrow be the same Am I just running in place? If I stubble and I fall Should I get up and carry on or will it all just be the same  'Cause, I'm young and hopeless I'm lost and I know this I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say I'm troublesome, I've fallen I'm angry at my father It's me against this world and I don't care, I don't care -----------------------------------------------------------------  ah, good charolotte. the princes of pop punk. despite the former fact, they still have some alright songs. so...im sitting here drinking some water. i was angry earlier cause i have to babysit my little one instead of going to a party that i would have been the life of. i took some painkillers though and now im straight. i really gotta stop doing that every time i get angry..im gonna die one day. : / OD ON PILLS. eh..its nothing to wave the flag about though. not like perscription pills or anything, i just take like five bayers and a couple of asprin and hope (sometimes) that i don't die. life is depressing anyway. but enough of that talk..life is also short. too short to complain, every chance you get.  something positive....LEE! i wuv him. almost love him. i think i'll love him for sure one day. we've been going together for a month and a day, to this day (like someone cares..lol). hes so much better than a lot of my other boyfriends. he calls everyday, and get this..hes actually, INTERESTING! *gasp* yes folks..he actually intrigues me. hes more than just a pretty face. hes a friend and i can talk to him about like, everything. he listens to. perhaps its just puppy love. but i'll make it into more than that. : ) he asked me the other day, if i was attracted to this certain other guy. to make a long story short, the issue of trust came up, and well..he trusts me. its just me trusting myself thats hard. but i'll try my best.  well kiddies, thats all for now. dont forget to eat your veggies!
