Fortunately, I received a text message from my classmate informing me that we’ll be meeting at 9.   	It was a restful sleep albeit a short one.   	I took a really quick shower at around 6:15 and it was terribly cold, changed into my usual get-up, grab something to bite then, go. I spoke with Luel on the way to Butuan since we took the same ride. Had a long conversation about our respective return demos, our very strict mothers, busy schedule and of course, medical experiences.  	Arrived in school about 8:30 then went straight to our assigned rooms to meet my group mates regarding our activity.   	The meeting went really well, we were already assigned to our areas of activity and later on December, we’ll be visiting the Provincial Jail, for “Handog Pamasko”. The Dean was impressed with our comprehensive report and our cheer.  	Anyway, about 11:00, I bought some DVD’s for Father Ruel, then went to the bus station and took a bus for home. I arrived at 12 noon, just in time for lunch which I terribly needed. Good thing though, even if it’s brownout, Nang Marilou managed to save me some ice for my iced tea.  	Took a well deserved nap in the afternoon…pampered myself with manicure, pedicure and foot spa. Then at 4:00. delivered the DVD’s and wrote down my schedule for Lectors’ serve.  	And now, currently, checking my e-mails, replying to some and deleting all junk mails.  	Tomorrow is the start of the ADVENT season and it’s Lola Disay’s birthday. Hmmmm…another late night for me.               December breeze is definitely here, beckoning the coming of Christmas. Christmas lights are everywhere and carols are already heard. December always makes me feel so...i'm still trying to find the exact word. Later.
