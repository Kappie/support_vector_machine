It was not a traditional con, in the sence that sleep was ordered and manditory. There was no spirit committee. I was in a very large leadership role, being chair of the YAC and having to organize and run elections, help run the group, etc. Samaya continued and pushed my roles too. I learned a lot of new leadership roles and positions, how to effectively run a meeting, the importance of topic dog, and more. This can help me at YAC meetings, youth group meetings, and even discussions at school - picture topic dog barking during a debate or something, and imagine everyone's confusion but mine. Mwahaha.  Sanford couldn't go, and neither could many others. Only about 30 people attended, mainly being from various parts of BC. There were 4 people from Seattle, trainers from San Jose, California and Otsega, Minasota, a DRE, youth from Victoria, North Van, Richmond, Kelowna, Bowen and Pender Island. Kevin was like a replacement Sanford, in his personality. There were major flaws between the two: Sanford has the amazing gift of healing touch and making  you instantly better, while Kevin was lacking.   And I'm sure if I pulled out the bag of marshmellows, he wouldn't understand what to do.  But I'm on the moon and no one else is :P  Learned the moom riddle, the triangle game, the bang game, and new songs. Learned great respect for others, and how to be concerned for everyone. I'm so upset that more people couldn't take advantage of the situation and attend. Then I came home and reality hit in.  Problems with the YAC elections: People are angered at Samaya and me for something we did without consulting the group as a whole. Making her feel really bad, which is something I feel bad for, because Samaya is a wonderful person. It's my fault, I want to take the fall.  Problems with youth: I'm dreading that place. Things are happening. Our group has been red-flagged, which means we might not exist soon. The group's negativity is getting me down too. I'm getting to the point where I might leave and not come back. Start a new, better group. Be happy.  Problems with Adam: Are currently being sovled. I freaked at him, we talked things through, we won't talk to each other until tomorw, where we will burst, and I will find out what he plans to do about us, and everything. I hope he does something where we are both happy..I would say right thing, but there is no right thing in this situation. I can't wait until I don't have to hide us, or anything.   The most lasting thing that will stick with me this weekend was the angelwash that we did in a cemetery. Before I bother explaining that, just picture: Moon overhead, about 11 at night, in a cemetery, chanting.  An angelwash is a very moving, spiritual, touching worship that has ever been invented. There are two lines, people on both sides. The males sing a sort of Mmmmmm mmm...low sound, and the girls sing Tra la la la la la la la la, Tra la la la la la,  and repeat. Slowly, a person on each end goes through the middle of the line with their eyes close, and the people on each end hug, touch, whisper words of encouragement, and sometimes even kiss the person going through, until they reach the end.  Picture that in your mind. Picture how moving it was in a cemetary.  We also went out before to see the lunar eclipse. That was a really unique, awesome sight on it's own.  I'd like to close now, with my favorite song learned this weekend. I'll be singing it forever, and Alicia, I'd like to know how you found it, and who it's by and stufflies...  **** When I was younger Oh they told me I was wrong to be strong Wrong to be strong  Now I'm older And I tell them That I've been giving away my power For far too long  Now I'm taking it back Now I'm taking it back Taking it back back back  Because it's mine  Now I'm taking it back Now I'm taking it back Taking it back back back  Because it's mine ****  Blessed be all..
