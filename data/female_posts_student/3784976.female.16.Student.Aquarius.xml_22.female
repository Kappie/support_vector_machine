Well He is there, and even though you can't hear Him, you can feel Him and sense His presence. Sometimes when I am bored or worried, I find myself talking to Him. It comforts me in no way that any other person can. I know He is watching over me, and even though He knows everything I am thinking and everything I do, all the evil things, He still forgives me. Somedays I wonder why He sticks around. Even though I hate to admit it, somedays I just get so mad at Him, even though He did nothing wrong. And then I find myself wishing that I could go back and take back everything I said. Even though He forgives me, the things I say will always stay in my head.     I saw a garage sale  Pulled up in the yard  Found a statue of Jesus  It was 8 feet tall  He held out His arms  And He seemed all alone  So I loaded him up  And I drove Him home     Out by the driveway  He looks down the street  With long hair and sandals  Made of rebar and concrete  I painted Him white with a long purple robe  He's a rock of ages on our gravel road     He's an eight hundred pound Jesus  Standing taller than a tree  He's an eight hundred pound Jesus  A bigger man than you or me     I thought loosin' my job was  The end of the world  Till my best pal ran off with my best girl  I felt suicidal with no real friends  So I walked outside with a rope in my hand     Out by the statue there's a big Oak tree  So I stood on His shoulders  And I counted to three  I had every intention of buying the farm  But when I jumped off  He caught me in his arms     He's an eight hundred pound Jesus  Standing taller than a tree  He's and eight hundred pound Jesus  A bigger man than you or me     I wanted to return the favor to Him  'Cause I never had a more solid friend  So I painted some flowers  All around his feet  And bought him a flock of ceramic sheep     He's an eight hundred pound Jesus  Standing taller than a tree  He's an eight hundred pound Jesus  A bigger man than you or me     He's a bigger man than you or me
