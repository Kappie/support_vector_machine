She wondered briefly if these people might provide the sense of adventure she missed since the Goa'uld had been destroyed. The Stargate had been buried on her homeworld of Arrakis, so returning home was not an option, either, even if she was certain to have a home to return to. Whatever this galaxy was that she had happened into, so far, it hadn't proved anything more interesting than helping the other Tok'ra to build their own civilization.   But these people, whoever they were, sounded as if they might help quell her thirst for adventure.    We should return to our own,   her symbiote reminded her.   They need us to help build a world that might be seen as acceptible to the Tau'ri so that the people of their world can learn of us and we can have relations with them.    Khala rolled her eyes. "When the Tau'ri first met you--us," she whispered back, her low tones blending into the din from the other customers, "they could barely accept us for who we are. What makes you think that the general population of the Tau'ri can take it? They have not seen as many strange things as the first group had."    It can be introduced to them more slowly. Also, with the Goa'uld threat gone, they will not initially believe us to be those hideous beings,   insisted Aldwin.  "The Tau'ri are no less superstitious than my own people. When  I  first met you, I wanted you to undergo the Test of Abomination or at the very least, the Test-Mashad. The Tau'ri will not accept us any easier than I accepted you. It will be as if we had to pay the Taqwa again."  While she said this, the human seated facing her in the next booth caught Khala staring at her, so the Tok'ra diverted her eyes; it would do no good to have any new suspicions here. Already, she had upset the security force guarding this world. If they found her here, both Khala and Aldwin knew that they might have to defend themselves, and that would involve physically harming or incapacitating the unfortunate souls sent to capture them. Too many years avoiding Harkonnens and Jaffa at any cost could not benefit the well-being of anyone the Tok'ra saw as an opponent.     You have too little faith in them, Khala,   Aldwin concluded.   Even if they do not initially assist a friendship between us, they will not condemn us, even as Colonel O'Neill does not.   Now, we should return and do what we can for our kind.    The Fremen nodded, again watching the other booth. "I know. We'll leave when I finish my drink." With that, she picked up the glass in front of her and took a cautious sip of the ale, carefully noting her symbiote's impressions of it.
