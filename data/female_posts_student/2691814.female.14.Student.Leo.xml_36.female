I couldn't hear myself sing and i didn't wanna sound bad so i faked singing hehe. We're singing a really great song called "To be young" and i hate that i can't sing it right now. I'm all stuffy and feel tired and I'm always frowning cuz i feel grose lol. I feel all tangly up inside. I got another letter from poetry.com just a confirmation that i ordered one of the books. Ya know what...I've really been neglecting my tarot cards lol...i think later i'll do a celtic reading or something. Oh ya on the bus today, everyone had to face the front and basicly shutup. Well lil kevin(gabby's bro) just 'moved his arms the wrong way' and got a referal. Jeremy and Myra already got 2. But it was pretty funny cuz gabs and cindy were makin noises lol..and they sit behind me so i tried not to laugh but some ppl know me well enough to know i can't stay quiet when the room or a place is silent lol. Its impossible. Everytime I do a staring contest with someone i blink or when we do those laughin contest im the first one to crack up lol. Anyway...I'll be on AOL later if anyone wants to talk. *Pumpkins? lmao*
