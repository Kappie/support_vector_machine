Its lots of fun, and ive been meeting tons of nice, cool people.  HAHA the other day i was in one of the rooms with a bunch of people my age and the this 19 year old from argentina came in and was like i need help, my girl firend wants to make out with me and have sex! we were like what? why are you telling us this? and then we started asking him questions that could possibly help him..it was so funny!!  if you wanna go sometime all you do is.. go to http://www.andyroddick.com make an account (its really easy and doesnt take long) then go to chat...it really couldnt be any easier...  My fourth was really fun!! Saturday we woke up around ten (which was really early considering we didnt get home and asleep until around 3:00am) and drove out there..we ate a little breakfast and then started grilling lunch, but until then we just sat around outside and played cards. The conversation while we were sitting around got quite interesting...someone had asked gina about her boyfriend dane (something like are you still going out) and i wanted to just let them know what she was dating so i said something about him looking like an elf and from there it flew!! my uncles bob, chris, matt, tom, and my grandpa had the time of their life teasing her about it. they started talking about how he lives in a tree and how he always has the same number of lines on the fudge shoppes cookies. and then they started giving him nicknames (this was interesting) they came up with:Keebler, Keeble, The Keeb meister, The Keeb Man, Keeb-man-do, Keebles, and the list goes on for quite some time..and then they mentioned something about wanting to meet him, so they made gina call him and ask him if he wanted to come, he said he would once he got off work if it wasnt too late, when my grandma found out he worked at a liquor store she defiantely wanted him over (and to bring some black velvet) after that thoguh things died down ... and it was about lunch time. We had beer butt chicken...man was that good. then we cleaned up lunch and started grilling dinner. A lot of us went to go ply bocce (pronounced botch ee) that was fun for a while..and then a couple of us went to play horse shoes...that was interesting considering two of my uncles were pretty wasted. then we went to check out my uncles brothers house which is like a 3 minute walk from there house..it was so huge...then we went back to the house and ate....then we played cards watched movies and snacked the rest of the night...oh and we did cookie jar (ill explain some other time) then we went home.... Sunday we hung around house all day until about 5:00 when my bros friends came over...and  my sisters came over and then my uncle and aunt came over with there kids...we grilled til about 9 or so then watched fireworks til about 12:00 it was so awesome...my brothers finale didnt go off so they covered it in Kleenexes and lighter fluid..it went up in flames ( the flames was seriously like 7 feet high) it was so great!! and then everyon went home...and well yeah thats about it.
