It was really exciting because I hadnt heard his voice in like 3 days.Lol I just took a compatibility quiz to see if Kon and I are "perfect for each other" and I got:    SmarterChild: You Two Are a Perfect Match  You and your boyfriend have similar values, interests and personalities. You get along well most of the time and find that if you have a conflict, you can resolve it. Being compatible doesn't necessarily mean being able to read each other's minds, but it does mean being on the same wavelength most of the time. It appears that you and your boyfriend see eye-to-eye on important issues, which is a good sign for your future together. Congratulations on your compatibility.    Feels Nice to know!  Yesterday I met my roommate Erin and luckily it seems like we won't have many issues living together. I was a bit nervous meeting her, but we ended up having a nice lunch at fridays. I then babysat a pretty annoying little girl and was happy to go home finally. Tomorrow I am going to St.Mary's and hopefully will do well on my Spanish Placement Exam. I will also sign up for classes and hopefully see the dorm where I'll be staying :) Im super excited!! Just praying for good weather!
