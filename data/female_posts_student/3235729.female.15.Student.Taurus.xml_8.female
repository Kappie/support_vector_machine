Then, Microsoft Word decides to gibble up, and I lose all my information. I almost died. That took  forfuckingever  to type! And now I just finished typing it out, all I have to do tonight is blog and practice drums. Then tomorrow I have to have drivers and study for my drivers test afterwards AFTER all my chores. Then Tuesday I have drums. After Drivers. If I'm lucky I'll get some socializing in Wednesday or later...I've been pretty busy.  So Friday, being it my birthday, I had a few people sleep over, and we went bowling, watched fire, and ordered pizza. And such. Yeah it sounds boring, but it wasn't. It was pretty entertaining. Then Saturday...What the fuck did I do Saturday??! Oh right...In the morning I went with Lindsay and my mom to Telus in the Cornwall to fix my cellphone, then I went out for supper with my family to East Side Mario's. This was the belated "Birthday supper" type thing, so my parents told the people that work there that it was my birthday, and well, long story short, they sang me a song about birthdays to the tune of the Flintstones theme song, and I spun a wheel. I won a mug. It said I won a coke. I have  no  idea how that worked out. Then when I got home, I decided that for the remainder of the day/night I was going to study for drivers. I would do nothing with friends. And I accomplished that. For about 20 minutes. Autumn phoned me and we went to a movie. Then I slept at her house. I'm easily persuaded (at least when it comes to getting out of homework). And then today I went back to Telus because my web browser thinger wasnt working right and, well, that was pretty boring. Then I typed out my science. And now I'm blogging....So today was pretty fucking boring eh?  But yeah, I gotta go...It's 8:31 and I still gotta practice for drums because I havent AT ALL....and I gotta study for drivers (or  try  to, anyway)...Later.   -Joebie
