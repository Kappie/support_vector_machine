She had a total hysterectomy, which isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that they found cancer attached to her rectum, and her ribs. They supposedly removed "every cell." That's a load of bullshit. They said the same thing for my Granny, and my great-Grandpa, but they didn't get every cell. She's supposed to be going through chemotherapy, which, as we all know, is supposed to help, but rarely does. Its just a matter of time before I loose one of the most valued people in my life. I don't want to see my friend go through that hurt. It'll take a miracle for her to live. Why does something bad happen just when my life starts to look up?
