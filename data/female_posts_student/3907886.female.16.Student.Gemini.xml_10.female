Well, for all of you poor deprived people out their who don't know, scripting is really just writing up the script for something. In my case, I get the privilege and honor of writing up a base outline for the FVTC scholarship awards banquet. Twice each year, my mum has to type up around 70 some pages of stuff that people say. It's long, boring as hell, but if u get a scholarship, you are required to attend. Anyways, each time, my mom has to retype basically the same script, just making slight changes such as the recipient, donor, name/amount of scholarship, and any memoirs that go along with it. Then she collects all of the speaker's speeches, and inserts them into their appropriate spot. So anyways, me and my smart mouth justhad to be getting annoyed that she's using my computer for like a week doing this stupid scripting. So I suggest that she just do a basic outline, or even better, just write up a program that asks you to type in   Category:  Scholarship:  Amount:  Donor:  Recipient (s):  Additional comments:   Then wham, bam, boom: you've got a fully scripted program that can be competed in only a few hours! Although the program would be fairly easy to write, she couldn't do it herself, and their wasn't anyone at work she could ask. Being the head of scholarship selection committee, it was her job to write script, so she didn't feel like she could ask the college for money to hire someone to write her up a little program jiggy. That's where I come in. I'm like, hey, why don't I just try to teach u a few basic computer commands, get u a book or two, and we'll go at it.   To all the computer geeks out there: "I'M SO SORRY! I HAD NO IDEA THAT WRITING SHIT ON THE COMPUTER AND ACTUALLY HAVING IT WORK WAS SO FUCKIN HARD!!!!"   After about 2 weeks, my mom's like, screw this. I'll just go back to the old fashioned long way...  But not me. I'm not the one to give up on a project so easily. So here's me and my good 'ole morals, attempting to write a lame ass program that doesn't even compare to what my brother can shoot out in about 30 min. And this has been taking all my time for like 30 days! Well, anyways I should probally go look something up online. I thought that if I got my mind off everything, I would just suddenly remember how to do shit again, but seeing how I still have no clue what I'm doing, it's not very likely.   Any help is appreciated!   Untill the next mental break down! :)   ~Ani
