Some days, I spend hours determining what the best culinary option will be given the weather, my current mood, and any cravings I might have. The answer is never Thai.  Today remains enigmatic. I have no strong desires and since I am not yet hungry, my stomach cannot dictate my mind. Of course, it's only 10:30 in the morning, so I probably shouldn't be worrying about lunch yet.  I often wonder if those great artists - musicians, painters, writers - that starved in their tiny garret apartments ever found themselves creating works of art to fulfill their hunger. It would be most amusing if an analysis of van Gogh's paintings indicated that while painting some of them he craved beef stew and potatoes, and while painting others, he craved hot Indonesian food. Eventually, due to his poverty he was stuck eating a jar of hot Indonesian pepper sauce with nothing to accompany it, which drove him into such fits of madness as he attempted to quench the burning in his throat that he cut off his ear.
