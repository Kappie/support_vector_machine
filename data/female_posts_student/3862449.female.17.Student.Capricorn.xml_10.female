I didn't really have any work to do in the morning, so i kept sara company in her little room, read a little more from Dr. Richmonds course notes, and saw a short presentation on visual perception. The presentation was really neat. I was shown all these pictures that played tricks on my eyes, and i couldnt believe what i was seeing, or what i thought i was seeing rather. For lunch, we had pizza on the department and watched some videos on color science. I learned how scientists use spectral graphs to match colors. The first video was quite interesting, but by the middle of the second one, my attention was dwindling. That afternoon i got some work from Dr. Richmond. He told me to check all these stars' light curves to see if they are variable stars. So far i haven't found any, other then the one he already knew about, but he says there is actually a good chance i might. I will probably be working on that for most of the day.
