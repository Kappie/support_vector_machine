I have a problem with it, though, so it'll most likely be changing..soon.  First semester: Civics and Economics Algebra 2 Computer Applications 1 Journalism 2  Second semester: Honors English 2 Chemistry Show Choir 2 AP Music Theory  The teacher they've signed me up to take algebra 2 with is the same one that I had for geometry that I absolutely hated and went to the guidance counselor about. Sooo..I'll hopefully be changing that soon. And while most of my teachers are listed beside my classes, I apparently have no teacher for Chemistry yet. heh. Kind of amusing to just see that blank spot where a teacher's name should be.   One thing I don't understand is that I have the same homeroom teacher I had last year, but I'm not taking her for any of my classes..uh. I mean, I had her last her for Honors English, but this year I don't have her as a teacher..yet she's listed on here as my homeroom teacher..maybe that was a mistake. I dunno.  Sooo.  I'm thinking about exchanging some games to get a new game..or maybe even  games ...just depends how much I can get for the ones that I don't want. I have a WTA (Women's Tennis Association) game that absolutely sucks and I've only played once...it's for ps2..lets see..I also have the Harvest Moon game for PS2 which was really bad..aaand I have the first Sims game for PS2, which was AWFUL o.x I was so incredibly disappointed by that game e.e  I looked through my N64 games to see if there were any I didn't want, but I like most of the ones I have so..will be keeping them. heheh. My N64 games vary..ranging from Diddy Kong Racing to Zelda 64 (which isn't even mine..I'm...*borrowing* it)...WaveRider 64...Super Smash Brothers (eee ^_^)..and..others. One of my favorites was Quest 64, but I never did get it. I did beat it, though. It had a very sucky ending.  I would  love  to be able to get the new final fantasy game for the comp with the money from my turned in games. I think it's down to $50 now, at some places. Buuuut..that game would suck my life away e.e; It'd be enjoyable, losing my life to that game, but still...bad. e.e;; bad.  Or I could get the Age of Mythology expansion pack..the Titans thing..but I'd also lose a large chunk of my life playing against people online with that. I mean, I've already wasted countless hours playing just plain old AoM online against people that can't speak my own language...  hm. I'm also trying to find the old N64 game SnowBoard Kids, with no luck. Aaron and I used to rent that game everytime he'd come over to my house, so I really want it just for the nostalgic factor, I guess. It was a good game, though e.e I've found it on Ebay a few times, but most of those are being shipped from the UK and I'm not going doing that, with huge shipping prices 'n whatnot.  Ok. I've rambled on and on..time to bring this post to a closing. Uh..bye ^^;  Song for today:  urlLink This is Not an Exit  by Saves the Day
