Can we have a CHICKEN MANIA party? It will mania-rific.  So... I'm so so so so SOOOO glad you had a great party. A SUPER-RIFIC party. I'm using a lot of caps this entry.  So Jessie found a man. Logically, that means we're next. I'm only saying this because last time Jessie found a man, about 3 years later I did. Wait. That is not a good outlook. I take it back. The two are in no way corrlated and in much sooner than two years I will find the perfect guy, as Jessie has found joneric. That is my resolution. Along with the metrosexual thing that I wrote about in my journal... like how I'm going to date one.  I really have nothing interesting to write. I'm talking to Jessie about how people are avoiding me like the plauge. I've been meaning to ask you.... do I smell?  I gotta go. I have to go... wash my hair.  ~Katherine
