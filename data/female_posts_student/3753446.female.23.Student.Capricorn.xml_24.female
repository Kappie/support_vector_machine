Brother: I do understand what you are saying about the women of Afghanistan ... but the thing is what you hear is it the Total Truth?, what is your source and from what point of view are you looking at this issue? with all respect and humbleness, Almighty Allah knows the best, I don't know much about the Taliban Govt. and just like me there are thousands of Muslims and nonmuslims here in USA. So whatever i know is what I hear on the Western TV. and news paper run by Western people, So how real and true are these sources ?? .... So my question is what is your source, and how strong and real is it? Until you are sure of something, don't speak of it. I suggest you do more research on this issue.   So of course I wrote back vehemently... what? why do our superficial egos tell us that we gotta keep our mouths shut if someone who claims* to be like us is doing somethign utterly WRONG?   This is what I wrote.   Me: Thank you for your comments. I appreciate that you wrote back to me. Not to belittle anything you have said, because I understand you mean it in best interest, but I have heard this skeptical comment before. The interesting point? I hear this always from brothers, never from sisters. out of curiosity, do you believe what the taliban demanded of women was islamic in any way? i am a practicing hijabi and believe in it. i chose it against my mothers wishes. i have studied the concerns of women in afghanistan in depth. i support the petition not because of who is promoting it but simply because I do not beleive that the so-called "Islamic state" the taliban had started is at all Islamic. some statements in the petition description may be worded incorrectly. however, I believe that the main objective, obtaining the women's rights as human beings is clear, and that is what I am keeping in mind. I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it is for or against. I'm a human being first and foremost, and as such I'm for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole. Malcolm X i read 30 books on this "issue" of Muslim women of afghanistan and abroad and wrote a 40 page paper abotu muslim women. i've spoken at countless forums about muslim women. Women in Afghan, who were renown and excellent surgeons/businesswomen/lawyers before the Taliban came along, were made to lose their jobs and be secluded in their homes SIMPLY and ONLY because they were female. The taliban stopped educating their women, why? it was against the law to educate a girl. mashallah some sisters began underground schools to teach their daughters. there are public beatings of women, which i have seen footage of. 12 year old boys are given "guardianship" of 4 or 5 older women. It is not false propaganda. It DOES happen. I hate that muslims all over the world are keeping silent in the face of such injustice, simply because the unjust ones are labeled as Muslims. beign muslim isnt impunity. we WILL be asked one Day. so we should fear that and remember. so why is this? because the "degree above" women that taliban believe men have is apparently as high as teh sky! because women are "weak in religion and intellect" (an absolutely false statement attributed as 'hadith' in some areas of the world). if that is the case, then why was Ayesha (ra) the Prophet Muhammad's favorite wife? she was educated, she was modest, she was strong, and argued, she* taught men* religious knowledge and medicine... even treating Abdallah (ra) as close as a son. she never had children of her own, and she expressed her jealousy of the other wives. she was beloved by the Prophet (Saws), so much that he died in her arms. a real strong woman, mashAllah not the stupid barbie doll that the Taliban think women are. and also, why is fighting and killing one another, even other muslims, such a priority for them? what about hadith that guarantee paradise to any parent who raises a daughter and gives her a good education and good marriage? what about the hadith that the strongest person is not the one who wins at a fistfight but the one who controls their anger? what about the hadith that said "now we go from the lesser jihad (war) to the greater jihad (jihad of the nafs, the battle against your inner self)? where is their mercy? I suggest you do more reading and contemplating. Do you honestly believe that our Merciful Lord wishes these conditions for women? Do you believe this is how women lived during the time of our Prophet (saws)? Peace, Sr Sanjida
