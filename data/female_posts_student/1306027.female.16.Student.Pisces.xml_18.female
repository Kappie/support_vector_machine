Ahhhhh Camp:  It's all about the good times, and man did I have them. Some of my fondest memories would be.....   1. Holding my breath while passing a graveyard(taking cheat breaths all the way). 2. Riding in a charter bus for the first time.  3. Disecting a rat and seeing jessica turn a morbid shade of green.  4. Outwardly dissing gus and arvin.                                          5. Giving sachin his TA present. 6. Working my butt off and getting an A- in my class. 7. Throwing food at various unnamed people. 8. Complaining about the food. 9. Complaining about EVERYTHING. 10. Hanging with the hall mates.   There's a lot more that I could list... but right now I'll leave it at that.    That is the end of my blog writing. What a total waste of time, right?
