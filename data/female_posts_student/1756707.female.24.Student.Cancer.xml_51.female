Leading to, what are the conventions of a blog, and is it a blog if it doesn't follow those conventions?  Are blogs truly searchable? In other words, you can't actually find something you're interested in unless you know what you're looking for... Looking at blog archives tells you nothing about where you want to go. So how else could we conceive of archiving other than just chronologically? And is archiving like that possible (I'm sure it is, but we probably don't even think of that) And how does archiving a blog compare to archiving someone's journal in a collection?
