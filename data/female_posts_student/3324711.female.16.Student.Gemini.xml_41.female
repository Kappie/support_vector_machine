And I hate to be whiny but these dreads are definetly NOT summer hair. Anyway.      So Lauren is gone and I will miss her terribly.. Its gonna be tough to keep up the hotness without you but Ill do my best.      I was actually thinking about staying off the computer for a week or so last night, then I realised that I am way too weak. Damn this machine.      Im off to do something, you know.. whats that word. Productive.       Listening To : Alanis Morisette's JLP cd
