Last night (once I got my Dad outta the dining room from working) I sat down at the computer, and in 30 minutes time, I cranked out 2 pages of my term paper.  And this was just in my introduction and the biographical info on Atwood.  So, I think it's very possible that I will hit very close to 10 pages... and just as plausible that I'll EXCEED 10 pages by a bit.  However, sometime this weekend I have to get together with a couple members from my group in music class to paint the background for our play.  It's kinda elaborate, and we've definitely got our work cut out for us.  Then we have the play on Tuesday... the same day that my term paper is due.  And Weds. I have to turn in all the rest of my projects for my education class.  I think I've figured out how I'm going to do this.  Because it seems my Dad has decided this is the weekend that he wants to start working in the dining room.  Yesterday he ripped out the carpet, and started putting wood all over the ceiling because he's going to put something else up there so that cracks won't be visible and he won't constantly be repairing stuff.  This makes it incredibly hard to try and sit at the computer and type out my paper.  So, I've decided I'll work on the other projects I have to do during this time.  Then at least I can have them done.  I only have 3 things left to do... and really only 2.  I already have everything ready for my last book, I just need to print the stuff out, and put it in the folder thing.  So, I have to make my poster (educational one) and my other game.  I have no clue what other game I'm going to make, but I'll figure it out soon.  I should probably retype and print out a clean copy of the script for our play by tomorrow at the latest.  Because the professor has to have one.  In the meantime, I'm going to rest.... I'll be glad when this semester is over for good.
