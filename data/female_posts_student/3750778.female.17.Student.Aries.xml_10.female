I didn't get messed up on drugs or other popular things, I didn't go partying, I went to church! and I don't mean the kind of church where you sit in your pew and sing hymes. I mean the kind of church where you actually praise God! Think about 2000 teenagers jammin out , worshiping God! God has been so good to me. He has forgivin me and anointed me with his fire! I will never be the same!   This generation that we were born into is a generation of EXTREMES. The way we do our hair, the way we dress, the loud music we love. We are not satisfied with just sitting in church and listening to some old man talking about the same old thing! We are not satisfied with sitting around singing the same old hymes. We want more! We want a more ETREME JESUS! The time is now! We are all called but few are chosen! And I am chosen! and I am willing to do whatever it takes! I am willing to sacrifice everything that I have, all friends, all relationships, all extra corricular activities!   This is me stepping out in faith. The world doesn't believe in God because they have never really seen someone who does, someone who really follows him and does his will. Now I take up the cloak of old evangilists, raticalists, and preachers. There is no stopping God. This is the generation that will change the world! The generation that will Overturn this country!  We are hungry for something, but most of us don't even know what! I have found the only thing that can satisfy. I have found the living water, the bread of life. and I know without a shadow of a doubt that this is the only way the life!   I won't be online much for the rest of the summer, or the school year... or better yet I wont be on for the rest of my life..   There is nothing I can do about this, my life is not my own. I have given everything I have to God and I can not turn back! IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE CHANGES I HAVE MADE, SORRY, I'LL MISS YOU, BYE.   PLEASE HEAR ME, I AM YOUR FRIEND, AND I WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE YOU HAVE REAL LIFE!   Awaken O sleeper! It is time to get up and praise the Lord!
