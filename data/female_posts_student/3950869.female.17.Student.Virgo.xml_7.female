I love it up there-the feeling is amazing. So different from the coast...well at least to me that is. Not so sure I could live in a big city like that though.  It's 11:07 right now and Christopher, my nephew, is on the couch asleep-and here I am typing for myself, sipping fruit juice, and listening to Journey's faithfully. Music-I love it. All varieties, whatever catches my ear, whatever catches my emotions...country, alternative, soft rock, latin, jazz, the genres go on and on. Ha-it's 11:11 right now...reminds me of Puja in class. She never missed making a wish on that thing. Occasionally I would wish, just for the fun of it too. It's exciting about going off to college, but I still have longing for the past. I kinda want to go back one more year-not possible I know.  It's a mystery. But they still try to see  Why something good could hurt so bad... One love feeds the fire. one heart burns desire. Wonder whose crying now? ----Journey.  Night.
