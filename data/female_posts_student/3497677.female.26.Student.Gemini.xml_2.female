One can't go around crying all the time...  But I'm doing well.  Still recovering, it hasn't even been 2 weeks yet, and I'm off work... and most every thing else for 6 weeks.    I am still 181.  Haven't gained.  Haven't seen so much as 179 yet.  But we can work on that soon I guess.  Against my dr.'s order I began some rehab excersizes already.  My body feels fine.   It feels like its helping, so I'll make my choices myself.  But the bandages are all off now so, I can get walking.  Couldn't exactly go gettin all sweaty in the bandages.  Even though they told me to get walking.  Ya know??  This is lower alabama, it's like 90-100 here every day right now.. geesh.  Anyway.  That's all for today.  I had a crappy day today.  I threw up once, really not a good idea so soon after surgery...  grr.  But tomorrow I promise myself will be better.
