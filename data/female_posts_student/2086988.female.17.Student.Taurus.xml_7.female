I've been trying to get my mind off everything, so I've been doing as much as possible to do that. I finally saw LOTR: The Two Towers. It was awesome, Orlando Bloom and Elijah Wood are so freaking hot, I love their eyes and omg Elijah's hair, ahhhh so sexy. It reminds me alot of David's hair, god his hair is so freakin hot, he better know that when I see him I'm going to mess with his hair, so sweetie you better not have a phobia about that. Ok, don't think I'm a freak or anything but in a weird, sick twisted way, Gollm from LOTR is kinda cute, lol, I know I'm probably on something, like he's so repulsive looking its cute...I don't know. I'm going to shut up now...  What do you do when you need to tell someone something but you're afraid of their reaction? I guess if they love you enough they'll understand and forgive you for the things that you do to yourself...and I'm making a promise that'll I'll never do it again, no matter how upset I am, all my friends know, there is just one person out there who I care really deeply for, that I don't want to know, but he'd probably find out sooner or later, you can only hide things for so long...Just understand that some things are way too stressful and people deal with certain things different ways. That was just my way of letting things out, and I promise everyone that I'm never going to do it again, I swear to y'all. So David I hope when I tell you, you won't be upset with me or wanna break up, I'm so sorry I haven't told you sooner...I hope you can forgive me...   It's undeniable that we should be together It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never The basis is need to know, if you don't know just how I feel Then let me show you now that I'm for real
