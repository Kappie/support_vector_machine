I was reading her LJ, and I responded to it. I would tell you all that I wrote, but it is soooo long that it probably would fill up as much as 3 or 4 journal entries (and I write entries that are long enough as it is). I made rebuttles on everything that she said. Grr I don't even want to go through it again.  Anyways, on to the Aha! Experience... Ellen is acts like she doesn't care that much about guys when she is around them. She gets so easily pissed about Hunter and Matt all the time or whenever some guy says something about her. She just gets mad and pissy, but then tries to give the impression that she doesn't care. The thing is that I am not the prettiest girl around, so I never had guys chasing me. There have been a few, but I just really haven't felt anything like this before. It is an odd feeling, and I don't even know how to respond. Anyways... I was reading more of Ellen's LJ before I bitched back. She was talking about this guy, Jason, and how she is totally "infatuated" with him despite the fact that he is 8 years older than she is. On the other hand, she is totally "infatuated" with Cory despite the fact that she has never talked to him other than online, he is bi, and he lives in Virginia. Then, I was reading her LJ she wrote all this stuff about when they went to the Haunted House, he held her hand, and she really liked that feeling and wanted to save it forever or something. Then there is the thing that I mentioned about the Armageddeon movie with the animal cracker scene. Also, she was so excited when she thought that Cory really liked her. When I told her that it was all a big joke, she got all pissy again, and wouldn't talk to me. Truthfully, I should have stayed mad at her, but I couldn't because I felt mad. I thought that it was my fault, but upon rethinking it numerous times, I have come the the conclusion that she was overreacting. That is what this whole Hunter situation is... Jealousy and overreacting. She gets mad, wallows in her own sorrow, posts it in her LJ and makes it seem like her life is just *so* awful, and then gets people to respond about it. I told her that "I am not going to pull a damn Lisa." She thinks that it is the end of the world, but it isn't. My God, can she just step back and look at how stupid this whole thing is?
