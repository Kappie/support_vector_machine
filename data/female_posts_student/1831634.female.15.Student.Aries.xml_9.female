I went there wanting to get a shirt like the lacy black/white ones I keep wearing (cuz I like them and wearing these two all the time is a bit... gross), but they were ALL SOLD OUT.  And last time we went (saturday) there was an entire RACKFUL.  I was soooo freakishly mad.  And they were cheap, too!  either 3.97...?  (perhaps that's why they were sold out.)  but!  instead my mother got me strange "crop" pants (the kind that aren't long enough to be pants but not short enough to be capris..  annoying is the word for them... they just kinda hang at your ankles) that were on sale (of course).  but they were black and they are comfy, so yeah.  then I chose to get a skirt (of course) because I luuuuuuuurve them (who hasn't noticed yet?) and they're kinda sorta freaky but not to such an extent that they're urgly.  I lurve it.  But I can't wear it until summer (which starts in march here).  but I luuuuuurve it.  so maybe I'll wear it tomorrow anyways!  XDD  (see, I go ga-ga over skirts.)  anyhooooooo...  kai, you forgot to log out from neopets.  XDD  I'm gonna rs for you.  you should thaaaank me.  man, how do you LIVE with only 65 items stocked at one time?!  maaaaaan.  anyhow.  I'm going to go wear my skirt b/c I luuuuuuurve it!  (are you tired of me gushing over the skirt now?)  anyhow.  finished coloring the piccy, kai!!  it looks ubercool.  I erased the outlines for the hands and arms, so it's ALL determined by color.  it's aaaaaawesome.  lyke, uh, totally TUBULAR!  XDD  riiiiiiiiight.  ++sunny
