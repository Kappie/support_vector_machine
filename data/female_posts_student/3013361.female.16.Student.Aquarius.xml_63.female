I'm not all that I seem to be. There's so much more to me and if people would just give me the chance they would see who I really am. I'm not just some super hyper and random girl. I have all these ideas in my head and all these dreams and thoughts. I just wish I had someone to share them with. I wish someone would share their ideas with me because I'll listen. I try my hardest to give everyone a fair chance at proving who they are. I've made so many new friends by doing this so I really can't understand why people won't give me that same courtesy. If you would just give me a chance I promise I'll show you, you won't regret it, not for a single moment. I promise, a promise is all I can give you, but with me a promise is sacred. So, I promise, you'll see if you just open your eyes.
