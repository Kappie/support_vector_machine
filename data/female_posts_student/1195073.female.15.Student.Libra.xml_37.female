For all you not-yet-to-high school readers of mine..... don't get your hopes up, it's nothing that amazing.  Oh, well I'll shut up about it for now.  Well, I'm drinking a Tom and Jerry and watching A Christmas Carol.  Just chillin' like a villian.  OK, that's lame.  I've made a groundbreaking decision, though.  When I grow up, I'm gonna be rich.  So then I can afford fancy clothes.  And I can do charity work, of course. 0 : )    Well, Happy Holidays to all and don't expect another update until February/March-ish.  Maybe I'll do something kind of neat for the one year anniversary of the Daily Show with Mollio on February 10.  That's right folks, this blog is almost a year old!!!!!  Until then.....   MOLLIO (I just realized that posting my last name on the previous post was really stupid *edits it*) I
