Oh, and the copious amounts of very pretty boys (the one in the baseball hat to be precise... and then the two across the ice as well, but that's a whole nother story...)  Yea, so Greentree finally got his 60th, followed shortly by his 61st... woot much.  "We do not steel lids Naythan!"  "And you drink tea since when?".... mmm tea.  Yea, that's what I'm in the mood for.  Why can't un-single people be ogares (ogar- oger- ogure... hell if I know)  Yay for me making a copy of Shane's Billy Talent CD.  "Oh bravo!  Nice plot twist!"  Oh Fez, our fine forigen friend (foregin- forgine- foragin- oh lordy...)  Oi... sorry, but mint Zest?  What's that all about?  Je suis tres fatigue... Huit heur est tres tres ||early||.  Hahahaha, Mary Kay... oh you slay me.  "It's not Pepto Bismal, it's Lusious Blushious"  I'm so ADD this is truly sad.  I need a job, like really bad.  I have no money... this is madness.  Wait, wait just a second.  I have a whopping 66 cents in my pocket.  And a fabulous (and not so crisp) $5 bill.  Yea dude.
