After a little while, the storm stopped and they thought it was safe, so they all got out.  The lightning struck, hitting one guy, then it arched to everyone else.  Four people were hospitalized, and fifteen others had minor injuries.  One hundred deaths a year are attributed to lightning strikes.  It is said you need to stay inside for half an hour after a storm stops.
