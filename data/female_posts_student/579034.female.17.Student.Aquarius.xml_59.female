Then Saturday I had my race and we'll just fast forward there. Then I went shopping and FINALLY bought some cute jeans in Abercrombie. Like, when ever I go in there for jeans they are either too long or too short or too loose or too tight in some places but I founda cute pair. I'm prob gonna wear them tomrrow for dress down. So, yea, then Sunday I hung in at my dads and Aunt Donna, Uncle Bruno, and Mario came over and we hung out. It was fun. Today was actaully good day. It went pretty fast and I didn't have Church History causea Lab so thats ALWAYS good. So yea.. I dunno today was just good... good karma. At track we only ran like 10 minutes and then we went and too some pictures for the year book. It was kinda sad though cause it was Coach Salerno's last day. He left us with this really good like paper with a really good saying on it. So.. yea.. I needa go clean my room and then I have a chem and a math test tomrrow so I should study. Much Love!! x0x0x
