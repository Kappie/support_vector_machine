I dont know why this has suddenly hit me but I was just thinking about this as I was painting my room. I think that your room should show who you are inside...unless you really dont want people to know that. So I was trying to ifgure out what to paint and I couldnt think. I was going to do a huge colage of just pictures of whatever but I have decide thats not who I am. I want to have a dream theme to my room. To show that I am a dreamer. but what of my dreams. I have no clue what to do, not to mention the time talent or money! especially the talent. If I could draw what was in my mind It would be beautiful.. I think. but othere then a dreamer who am I? Do I fit into a catagory? I have no style! nothing that makes people think ME!!! im no one. I am a lost teenager, serching for her soul...searching for who I am. but as of now I am traped, to much so to find out what makes me me! and I dont mean traped as in not allowed out of the house, but traped as in my mind is closed and I cant think. I know things that I am, like a dreamer, but who am I really? this is a very angging question. one day Ill find out. Until then I am simple experiencing a lack of Identity!
