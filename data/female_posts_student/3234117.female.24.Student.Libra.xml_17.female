As a volunteer you agree to train and participate in a marathon or triatholon and raise a fundraising mininmum.  You get to train and participate in the marathon in the name of an honored patient that either you choose or is selected for you.  I'm actually extremely excited to get started on this.  Not only will it allow me to make some new friends, get in shape, but I will also be raising money for such a good cause.  Being a member will also allow me to go to a marathon in really awesome locations.  In the Fall you have a choice of participating in Maui, San Franciso, or Dallas.  Of course you have to raise more money to participate in Maui than San Francisco or Dallas.  It would be so gratifying to have raised the money on behalf of a patient to be able to run in Maui.  Wish me luck!
