I guess actually calling her Alison had a little too much emotional baggage with it, so she used a variation instead.  Works for me, but MY mom gave her a bunch of crap about it - "Baggage? Why would there be baggage?  Alison would be a wonderful name!"  And she wonders why Jess never calls her.  If I'm a PIA like that when I'm in my 70's, I sure hope someone gives me what for.  Mae is 'cos both Jess and Tom were born in May, and it had a nice ring to it.  And I was wrong - the baby is Alyssa Mae Ostrander - she took Tom's last name.  Also worked for me, though Kim didn't seem thrilled about it.  Anyhow, they're home with us now, and life is good, at least for the moment...  Daf
