Then, we left the house LATE (which is one of my BIGGEST pet-peeves).  We went to the mall, and it was so crowded...which made it frustrating, along with some other things that i wont discuss in here..but i did end up getting a new pair of jeans and a necklace.  Then when i got home, I had to go babysit.  It's crazy, the one day that i go over to the norkets' house frustrated, the kids are horrible.  They didn't listen to a word i said, AND the parents were an hour and 45 minutes LATE!!!  I was so mad.  DAH!!!  But hey, I know that somehow, today could've ended up so much worse than it did.  Still, i'm reallly thankful that God got me through it...and I didn't lose my temper once!  Lol.  ANYWAY..I'm gonna go to bed so I can be well rested for a MUCH better day tomorrow. :)   Good lyrics:  I see you standing there  I see a tear in your eye  Why’d you turn away  Why’d you run  Run til this point of breaking   No walking away You were the one  That I looked to  I never thought  I’d see you run  I never thought I’d see you  Turn your back on  All you knew was right  You turned your back on God  I see you’re back again  You’ll never run again  This time  No walking away  ^"This Time" - Kutless   Later  >
