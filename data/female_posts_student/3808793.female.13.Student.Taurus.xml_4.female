I'd paste the resulting curses I smashed out to a friend in all caps, but I have friends my age that read this, so it will be censored by the ERSB:  Missmaul54: S*** F***ING H******T C*****E SCHOOLGIRL ROBOT P*** F***BUCKET NutPxxxxxx: what. Missmaul54: i spent like an hour typing a blog entry Missmaul54: then accidentally hit ctrl-a Missmaul54: and just deleted the WHOLE **** ******** **** ********* SAILBOAT **** THING Nuxxxxxxx: osnap. Missmaul54: oh my god i hate the world.  So there you have it, kiddies. No stories for you, thanks to CTRL-A.   To go on and finish typing what I started, the Yay Pit is finally back up. Wheeeeeeeeee!!! Now I can get hit on by horny 8-16 year olds!!! (Yes, I've had 8 year olds try to cyber with me. Nasty.)  I'll post some actual content soon enough. I just got back from camp, bear with me. I just bought Condition Zero, so maybe I'll talk about that next entry or something.
