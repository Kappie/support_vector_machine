Am now extremely nackered *which wud explain the crap that i'm typing* LYNNE! Dont u eva do that to us again, u woke up more or less everyone thismorning txting jenny, we managed to go back to sleep but we were not best part pleased when we woke up and found out that it had been jenny's fone beeping bcos u had txt her despite the fact that u must have known that we wud still be asleep bcos we had been up late (4 o'clock to be precise). We were playing dance mat at 2am.  anyway gonna shut up. *someone tell me y i always end up saying that......*xoxoxoxox
