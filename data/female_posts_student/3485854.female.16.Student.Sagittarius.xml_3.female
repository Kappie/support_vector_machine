Why does it seem that i see this face in vain? Why do such good memories cause so much pain? Why can't one just forget the past. Why can't my heart truly let go at last?  All I ask is to feel the love. All I ask is to feel the strength. Yet, all I can think is why?  Why does it have to be so hard? Why did it have to happen to him? Why can't this face just leave my thoughts? Why must it call with such force? Why can't I let it all end?  I hope this face will lie in rest. I hope my dreams might go unpossessed. I hope solutions to these torturing riddles will come before another death.   Maybe that is the solution. But there is much I can't leave behind. There will will a time for the glimmer of objects, as they shimmer in my eye.  For now I must hold back this river of tears, as the face beckons me to come ever so nearer. A river I feel I will drown in before it is time.       Now, I know this doesn't follow any particular patter, nor is it very good i think, but it was one i was writting on the spot. It was just a glimpse of what is going through my head right now. Sorry if this one is such a drag guys. Maybe I shouldn't post on holidays anymore, nor about them. It doesn't do any good to bring others down too. I guess it's just a reach out for some type of companionship in a time like this. But i can't type anymore. I can't start crying any more than I already have, it won't do me any good. Goodnight.
