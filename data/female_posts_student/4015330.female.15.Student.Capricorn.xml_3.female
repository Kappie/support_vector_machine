See, I started one about 2 weeks ago, and I recently read one of the entries I had made and I had noo idea what I was talking about.  I figured if I thought it was crazy then everyone else would think it was. Now, you still think I'm crazy, but to a lesser degree than say, before when you would have told me to see a physcologist... or something. yeah, ok im an idiot.  This being my first entry, I've decided to only let you read a tiny morsel of what's to come... so.... here it is.... "Today when I woke up, I saw that my wall was still white, thank goodness. (I was afraid it was red, can you imagine?!) Anyway, I made myself a pancake, i use the singular because the first one I made looked like a dying rabbit and I try not to eat anything with a face, so yeah, i ate my one, lonely pancake." OMFG! That's only about 15 minutes into my day, and I'm already blown away by how captivating it is. Until next time my friends, make sure your pot is free of harmful additives.   nnnicole
