And now that it is here I spend the first whole warm day inside.   I think that is the fate of my summer though so I might as well get used to it! I have to decide whether or not I am going to swim a 2km leg of a half ironman this fall. I'm a bit scared and worried about who I'll train with. I need someone to do open water swims with me. But the more I think about it the more I want to do it!   I got my laptop and desktop so that they are the exact same which is nice. Now I won't have to drag me latop downtown anymore!! Just put all my files on a memory card and away I go!!! Yahoo!! I'm actually pretty excited about this development!  Now for a bit of reflection:  Communication is so essential to a relationship and I'm not just talking between those who are married or who have life partners. No I'm talking about any relationship between two human beings. If they are going to have any kind of successful interaction they must communicate. Now You might be saying...No sh*t Sherlock! But look at it from my point of view. I have been dumped, cheated on and lied to by my ex -- Again nothing novel--to make matter more interesting I work with him. Yes you read that correctly, I work with him. I committed the cardinal sin. But in my defense we don't really work together we are both grad students with the same lab space (we share a supervisor) but are in different department and have different projects. However now that we are no longer together it has been brutal to say the least...Especially since he wants "to have me in his life still." because of the manner and reason for which we broke things off I don't trust a word that comes out of his mouth. Okay so here's my revelation we are both struggling to thread together a relationship (for me one so that I can sit in the same room as him and not cry and he...Who knows he won't tell me, but that is not my point) but because I don't trust what he says and he has a tendency to lie -- which I now point out. We can't come to that point were we relax enough in our communication to actually say things that are either not hurtful or defensive. So is there any hope of reconciliation......  Probably not but like a stupid hopeful human I try.
