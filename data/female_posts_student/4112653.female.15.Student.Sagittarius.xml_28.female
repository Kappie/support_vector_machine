Then she looked at the young man at her feet, the vacant expression in his eyes and the smile on his lips.   "For my sister!" Her voice had become breathless with passion. "In her death, she became my life. And now she has yours. Why do you smile? Is death so good? I wouldn't know, and you cannot tell me. Will I ever find out?"

Just as death was the instrument of Marion, Marion was the instrument of Death.   It was a while before Marion realised that she was no longer cold in the chill breeze. She was not cold, but she was alive, so gloriously alive, and free from death. Yet she was fuelled by Death.   "Thank you."   The corpse did not respond.   "My sister is dead, but I am not. And neither is her killer. For my sister."   With the picture of Marions dying/dead sister held firmly in her mind, Marion began the long and epic quest for Tittanya.
