I worked some hella hours this weekend, which is great.  Not only is the money awesome, but I love everything I get to see and learn.  That and I just don't want to go home anymore.  Dad's being an asshole as usual, bitching at mom about everything.  Mom, as usual, is taking it in stride.  Why?  I don't know.  I wish she'd just divorce him already.  He expects so much from her when he doesn't do shit at all.  I feel sorry and guilty at the same time that my brothers go through this shit, because I'm rarely home anymore to point out and explain important things to them that my parents won't take the time to explain.  Sure, my brothers are bratty and annoying, but I love them and I love to be able to do things with and for them.  At this point, I give up on life.  My mind is twisting around in a million different directions and I don't know what to do anymore.  Sometimes, I wish I could be numb all the time so that I just wouldn't give a shit.  Sometimes I wish I had the money, time, and guts to go see a shrink.  Sometimes I wish I wasn't alive so I wouldn't have to deal with this apocolyptic bullshit.
