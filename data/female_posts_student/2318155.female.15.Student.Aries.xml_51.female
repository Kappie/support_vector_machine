"u grandmother fucker"....."u mother fucker"...."yes i am" lol i luv that movie. well ill let ya kno what happens when i get backfrom work but for now i think imma veg on my bed and watch some tv til i decide to jump into the shower and get all squeaky clean (: maybe if ur lucky ill have somethin to say to u guys before i leave...  blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:
