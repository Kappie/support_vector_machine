I had woken up at 10 to call the ortho's office because last night I popped that stupid bracket. Unfortunately they were out for the weekend. Getting the bracket fixed before I leave for Calgary should be very interesting. I leave on Tuesday the only time I can get it fixed is Monday. If my friends stay over from Cultus lake that day then that leaves me a very small window of time in which to get my mouth fixed. My mom is going to be very displeased about this set back in my mouth work, she was very adamant that I get it fixed today. I may be in for an ear full.      I'm debating whether or not I should take off to go to the Kung Fu school today or not. It would be a good idea to get a little work out in but I'm not sure. I would like to have a day of nothing. Well not really, more like a day to do what I love at my leisure. This means editing (I've overhauled four chapters so that means poor Bethie won't be able to do the Fraser parts). It also means that I will be able to read and watch a movie or     sigh     just sit. Maybe I'll have another bath as well.     If I do work out that would be good, but I really don't have the motivation. But does that matter? Ug I'd rather not debate this with myself right now.       I found I've been so busy that my writing has been neglected. And for some odd reason my school anxiety has yet to be shaken. I wish it would hurry up and take off. It may not even be that I'm frightened of this coming year so much as the year after that and university.   Grrrr  . I'm beginning to feel the pressure to get scholarships and bursaries, and... Well I should finish this bit now I know very well what my anxieties are.           Well Voyager is on and I haven't seen this one so Ta!
