Alex was supposed to come over but of course he didn't. he said it was because he had to pick his uncle up from dayton which makes sense, I just wish he would have called. I mean come on...he pinky swore!lol so I had my second oboe lesson today and well that was fun. I then went shoe shopping for my cousins wedding this weekend. of course I have to pass out programs for it meaning I actually have to look nice cuz I'm officaly"apart of the wedding"...they even put a bio about me in the program...urgh... but yeah..my mom wants me to wear a dress and well I said no..I want to wear a skirt but she said I won't be dressed up enough but I don't really care cuz I 'm gonna wear what I wanna wear...*sigh*   then I stopped home for a little bit and changed my clothes and then me and mommy headed to Childrens lighthouse which is a house for kids (ages 10-21 are there right now) can stay while getting free surgery and medical care in the us..I got to meet all of them and they are just so cool..they're so sweet, caring and I duuno just all have really big hearts. right now all of them are from tugikistan(spelling?) the couple who owns the house is going to honduras next week to get more kids. then they're take another missions trip in october to tungikistan and want me to come :) and I might actually be able to which means I wouldn't see alex when he comes to visit and I wouldnt be here for my 16th birthday but to me none of that matters. I'd much rather be there doing the works of the Lord..most of the kids are muslim but have become christians since being here which is way awesome...one girl even got healed! God's love is so amazing...well after that I came home and went rollerblading with my alex..haha...but yeah I'm gonna head to bed...
