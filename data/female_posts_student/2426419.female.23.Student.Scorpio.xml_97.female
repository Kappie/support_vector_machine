Even if I read and read all the time, I seem to become less intelligent; no new thoughts. But, I figure that as long as I feel something, I exist. "I feel; therefore, I am," says LaChelle. Feeling is very important. I have read studies where people who have amygdala damage in their brains make bad choices because even though they can still figure out logically what the better choice is, they don't choose it all the time because of their inability to recognize what the consequences of that decision might feel like. So YAY for JAY!  I now have a thesis for my paper. I now have visions of resources. I shall proceedeth to OU-eth tomorroweth to work and write that horrible horrible paper. My professors do not love me. And should they? I demand they do so. Yet, I still have to write the paper, whether I be loved or not. This is the obligation of life.   All I do is eat bad things and do homework. I look mortifyingly "icky" and my face is breaking out and I'm getting (what's a nice word for fat?) because I have to be locked in my apt. and libraries. What happened to ending college with grace and glamour? Katie Holmes looked so nice as a college gal. So tall, such clear skin. Straight teeth. I envy her Catholic good looks. No, I'm more of the unwashed frantic slob wearing gray sweatpants and surrounded by torn paper and obscure books. And I have grown-up braces. (hangs head). What's that all about?
