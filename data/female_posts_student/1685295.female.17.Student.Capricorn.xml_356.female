They suggest that men should ejaculate every other day to prevent prostate cancer... I looked over their experiment (the data that they had collected is online). They performed this study over a two year period and examined men of various ages, including men around 20-29 years old. Why would they do this? These men don't have a very high chance of getting prostate cancer... oh well. still a very interesting study.
