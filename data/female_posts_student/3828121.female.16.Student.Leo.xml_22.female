God Forbid was pretty good. last night was the first time I'd ever heard any of their stuff. Hatebreed, a pit broke out, and i got knocked around a bit. I thought I'd lost Shawn and Billy, but I found them again. that scared me. I was like, omg, I'm alone now. but if I'd only known what was to come, that would have been the least of my worries.  Slayer was when I got pretty much all my injuries. I got impaled in the side with someone's spike bracelet. I have a minor cut and bruise now. Shawn elbowed me in the boob, then hit me in the nose with his shoulder. Somebody grabbed onto my boob, and absolutely would not let go. i finally managed to escape.  i also got punched in the mouth, which caused me to bite my lip, whihc caused me to bleed.  but Slipknot...oh beloved Slipknot. yes, during the first song, i totally lost Billy, and i pretty much got "effed up the a" by someone behind me. I'm pretty sure I know who it was, but....yea....something was ramming itself into me, and it was pretty weird. i lost Shawn by the end of the second song. I could see him most of the time, but I couldn't get to him, so I gave up. then this 30 or 40 year old guy kept putting his arms around me like I was his girlfriend or something. it was a little freaky. but yea. I could tell Shawn was having a good time. I'm glad he went.  Next time anyone like that comes thru here, I'm taking him with me. He's fun to be around. and I realized how much I'd missed him over summer. but yes, it was great. except when i got home. I couldn't sleep b/c i hurt so bad. it sucked. but still, it was worth it.  JOEY JORDISON...........*drool*  oh yes, and i saw Jimmy, John's brother. he was bleeding out his mouth, but he was smiling. I was kinda like whoa.....  but yes it was highly enjoyable. i was dehydrated by the time the night was finished, but i didn't care. i was the happiest person in the world last night....
