My grandfathers story by: Tomoya Saito Walking toward school one day My grandfather thought it was all fine His country was at war, But what could he do? He was just a young boy of 14   Walking into school Talking with his friends And getting into place on the field For the morning exercise Just the usual things   Suddenly having to go to the bathroom He decided to hurry But once inside, he had only a second Before he saw a light through the window   A shining bluish tint he says It's what he saw Then a big explosion And everything went dark   Half an hour later He stands up Being blown 20 ft from where he was Blood all over his body Everything around him shattered and broken Dust in the air Fire in the distance   He runs back to the field And he sees his friends Fallen Charred bodies None left alive But there's no time to cry So he heads for home   As he rides along on his bike He hears the screams of agony Leveled houses, turned into rubble Dying people everywhere Some bodies with scatches Some with peeling skin Blood trickling on the street   Bleeding and exhausted, my grandfather must find shelter So he hides for safety in his home Or the remains of it anyway For many would live to see the next day But many more wouldn't In the end, 200,000 wouldn't But my grandfather was one of the lucky ones He's a survivor   It's strange for me to realize That if he died that day in Hiroshima August 6th, 1945 I would have never been born I wouldn't have this story to tell   But...   Wars are even going on today People getting killed everyday Let's stop this madness once and for all Peace on earth Please Let no more bodies fall ^^^ omg! i think i might start crying again!! well tell me what you guys think about this poem about, maybe my true love.. well bye
