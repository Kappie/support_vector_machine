i mean is it just the course we were bound to take? it's not like i'm heart broken or anything. it's just...regretable. now do i sound cold-hearted? that's not what i mean. i guess i'm saying there's not much that can be done about it. i wouldn't know how to try. and i'm too scared of being disappointed. i figure i can "go with the flow". have i ever mentioned how much i hate that expression sometimes? yet it's all that i seem to be doing. and i guess that it's ok. i cannot alter the course things have taken. i can do my best to adapt. let's try talking about happier things. hmm...well i tried to be mad at my parents for not letting me go play spotlight at wright's mill. but that didn't work out. we never stay mad at each other for very long. i don't think any of us have the ability to. but i guess it's ok, b/c i got to see ppl yesterday. and nadia spent the night. she hasn't done that in a long while. and monday there were ppl at jordan's house watching a movie - Vanilla Sky - i've seen it before. but i like it ok.  i can't remember this weekend. oh wait yes i can. it was father's day weekend. it was actually a good weekend i thought. :) especially saturday. haha. i'm so awful. i can't recall the week before that....i think i did stuff. i just don't remember what. wait! tom's house was friday....ek i give up. my memory's gotten so awful. maybe i should write more. about stuff i did. just for the sake of being able to remember stuff. i'm not usually this kind of forgetful. i think i went to chrissy's to see a movie. and maybe jordan's sometime to do something. or maybe not. sheesh. anyways moving on before my brain bursts. i finally renewed lord of the rings. i didn't get as much time to read as i would like. i think i lost my summer work stuff again. where does it keeping disappearing off to??????? i think we might go pick up our new car either tomorrow or saturday. that's exciting. but i still don't have my license. i'm going to be driving for driver's ed next week, and i'll probably take my test then to. let's hope tasnia passes. i'm getting kind of lonely. i would like someone to talk to. but this computer blocks out aim b/c the stupid machine is....stupid...i can go downstairs...but then those computers block out every other goddamn thing. *sigh* -_-; i think i should go read. it's getting to the pretty interesting parts. and then when i'm done i will have a marathon of lord of the rings movie day or something. b.c i am just that much of a dork. i decided to wear to work what i wore to bed.(well...plus jeans...) but i feel very comfortable now. some ppl (como dad) doesn't understand these kinds of things. or why anyone would want to go swimming in the rain. or just run around in a thunderstorm. thunderstorms are awesome man. the weather is so beautiful today. i hope it storms. that would be lovely. i rememnber this one time we were driving on the highway and it was the intro to bad weather. it had such an ominous feel to it. i loved it. it suits my mood.
