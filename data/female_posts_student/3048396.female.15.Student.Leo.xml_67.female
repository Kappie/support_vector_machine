I never saw this coming...Everyone told me we were perfect...we would be together forever...and have 20 kids...well maybe not 20...that'd kinda suck...but anyways. They always said we'd always be.   God why'd it have to end? WHY? This past year was the best year of my life. There were ups n downs...but I never saw it coming to this. Never.   I cry as I write this....My life ended tonight. I still may be living....but inside I am dead. I am lost. I've lost everything...How am I supposed to go on? God, why did I lose the love of my life?   I guess Tara just isnt meant to be happy...I guess God is just punishing me for something. I don't know what. But something. All I need now is a hug...but nothing will be the same. My life is gone. I lost it tonight. Don't know what to do now. Heh. This will probably be the last time I write before I leave for Tennessee. That'll be interesting. I guess im gonna have to end up getting a new blog too. Everytime I see the name Im gonna bust out in tears. I don't know what to do. Im gonna go crazy. Cassie...who is always happy and Im gonna have to take her swimming tomorrow. God...How can I face daylight? I should repaint my room now. Black. Everything. I need darkness. I hurt so God Damn Bad! Heh. I know his reasonings...but heh I just wish there was a way other than this. Maybe takin it slower? I dunno. I just wish it didnt have to come to this. But it did. My life is over.  Now my moms so worried about me...shes making me go on a walk with her. She wants to talk but thats the last thing I wanna do right now...but I guess...I will. I guess she and my dad are all I've got now...  Tara
