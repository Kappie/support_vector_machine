It was really... beautiful.  It was perfect. I just hope those thunderstorms in Dayton didn't dampen anyones spirits for that big music festival that I can't find a single peice of information on AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY! Ok, ok, I'm ok. I'm just going through a bit of stress right now... *twitches* Yeah that's another thing. My left eye has been twitching for the whole day and I don't know why. It's starting to bother me, just a little bit. Oh well, it happens. HAPPY FIREWORKS DAY CHARLIE BROWN!!! heeheeehee. I'm done. Me
