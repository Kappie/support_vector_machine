Not as good of a score as I would have liked to get, but oh well. Went to lunch. Laura bought me a soda since she owed me a lunch punch. Spilled some on my shirt, but I guess my shirt is liquid repellent or something because it didn't even soak in, which was a miracle. Haha.  Came home, got on AOL, that was it.  Virginia is spening the night out. Yes! "Seabiscuit" is in town, and me being the dork that I am, might go see it with Mary if I can ever get a hold of her! Oh well.   I'm nominated for homeroom rep., but I think that J.P. guy will win it... ah well.  Better get off the computer before I get struck by lightning! ;-)
