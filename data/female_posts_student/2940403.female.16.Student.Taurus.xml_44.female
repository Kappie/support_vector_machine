I think I'll make an offer with her to buy it for like five bucks.  She needs the cash, and I need a cool Tshirt.  English was decent, I got to sit by Brad and Beznit and we listened to all the eulogy's and one award speech by other students, and of course then I get irritated with the bitch sitting across the room from me because she kept saying shit about kids that would get up to present.  I wanted to slap her.  When Alicia went up to present, I could read her lips saying to the girl next to her how pathetic Alicia's speech was, or she'd make comments about the cuts on her arms.  How rude.  When Alicia then went to go sit down, I saw her roll her eyes and mutter "Oh... my... God..."  SHUT DA FUCK UP, HO!  haha. that was fun.  Then I almost got stuck at school until 7 tonight because my ride almost ditched me (good thing I can run fast), but that's another story that I'm not in the mood to tell.  Today the band kids left for Hawaii, and I've still got one day left of school.  It doesn't bother me, amazingly enough the weeks are flying by, considering how boring and empty they are.  Tomorrow will be boring... so will my break.  I need a break though, everyone does.  I hate my school system.    Nonetheless, I feel very relaxed right now listening to Beck.
