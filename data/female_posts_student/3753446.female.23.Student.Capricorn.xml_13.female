They're all untitled at present, but if you can think of a good title for any of them, or revisions or changes, let me know.   I heard you cough as  You said nothing was  Wrong The familiar cough Of a familiar problem The cough a dying  Man releases Hoping his spirit will Flow out with the  Blood and phlegm Did you hear me When I said I loved You and did you know I meant it    My heart fluttered for my friend And it was as though I never recognized you Did you say I had grown up? Did I look into your eyes As we smiled and laughed And wondered curiously? How did you interpret our time was it like me? You were one of many who had lost respect for me And perhaps it is because  I had lost an ounce of respect for myself, For not living up to the standards that so many respected me for.   You dared me to break wide Open Even though I felt too scared I have worked so hard to Build layers of protection Around my fragile heart And your strength of  Spirit shattered those  Walls I am glad that you did Because I was not about To do it myself I am relieved     So your kid sister has grown up Or your confidant has changed I am sorry I inspired you So much that I let you down I knew all along deep down That “me” was too good to be true,  Too good to last for you For everyone who thought it And especially for me But I like who I am now I’m glad to be stronger A little wiser, a little more trouble I just adore challenging people Perhaps I always will And despite how I have changed I still love being around you, knowing you,  Sharing with you, laughing with you You must know how much I admire you The way you treat everyone you know With such friendliness and respect If I could only get past my fear of your judgment I could let you know me as I really am Sorry my friend… and thank you.   Whimsical determination Her iron will shines through her worry She doesn’t know how her Laughter revives us Those of us who live by her Smile and loving heart For such a tough shell There is a deeply tender Adventurous, imaginative spirit in there That doesn’t know her own strength  And possibilities Don’t you ever cry When your laughter is like a  Heartsong for us   We are only intimidating Because we dare to break the rules for ourselves And challenge who you think you are And what you think is possible    Vibrance radiating from The toughest shell It is like iridescence How beautiful, colorful, The shine dancing through the air The brilliance eludes many From seeing too far inside the ornament Which you can only do if you step close enough To the star that you no longer see the rays alone But the fiery source that produced them Admit your vulnerability Because that is what makes you perfect. 	  Sometimes it seems the broken sky is gathering at my feet And in my haste to avoid the mess, clean up the mess, or destroy the mess I forget to look up again And see the holes left in that sky, twinkling down at me A gentle reminder that not everything has fallen Not everything is shattered And in the larger scene, even as the debris collects below, Punching those holes out of the dark was necessary  To create the greater beauty that remains
