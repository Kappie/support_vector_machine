People said it was scary, but I didn't really think so. It was pretty good, but the ending was somewhat stupid. Oh well. I talked to Holli for a long while on the phone too. We talked about prom and our boy troubles...haha. Good ol' girl stuff. I dunno, boys are confusing...let me tell ya! Well, maybe boys aren't confusing, girls just make them that way. I dunno. Oh well....no biggie. That was pretty much my day....boring.
