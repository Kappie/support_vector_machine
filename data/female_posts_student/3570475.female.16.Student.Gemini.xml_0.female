About the next school year, stuff I have to do, why isn't my computer working, what should I use to smash it to peices, how I should edit my last school year's group project to make it better (maybe I'll bring it in to show everyone at corps sometime), and about the website. Anyway, I was thinking that you all out there might have some really good ideas for it (the site). So heres a great spot to list them. I am open to anything you can think of no matter how dumb you may think it is; it may actually turn out cool! So come on in and show me what you got!
