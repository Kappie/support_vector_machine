The only thing I am hoping for is to not be surrounding by republicans who feel the need to pound their ideas into my head, of course I love hearing other's opinions, but there is a difference between informing and pounding.  I'm realling enjoying summer.  I'm happy. Life is good.  If only we could keep the people we love around us all the time.  But sadly, that is not the case.  My cousins left today, and I miss them so much already it hurts.  The younger one is a sophmore, the older one just graduated and will be attending college in Delaware (that is how you spell it right?).  I won't be seeing them for at least another year.  How is that fair?  We took them to Sedona, stayed overnight and hiked (unfortunately no camping during their trip). Ate dinner downtown, I went with my older cousin to get her nose pierced (her mother freaked out). And we all went to the Grand Candy, stayed in a lodge, and hiked. Well anyways, I miss them.  I need to get reading, I have 4 books left before school.  Not too bad, I just get lazy with the writing about them in a journal thing.  I'm not looking forward to reading Frankenstein, so I figured I'd read that next, get it over with.  I loved The Joy Luck Club, on my list of favorites now. Well anyways, I will start Frankenstein tomorrow and hopefully I won't despise it, we'll see.  My mom said we might be able to go on a river trip in the canyon after I return, I dont know how solid that plan is, but I'd be so excited if we could go.  Next summer, or the first summer I come back from college, I am hoping to go hiking and camping with my brother in the canyon, that would be fun.  When we were there the other day, a family was hiking up, i think there were 3 children...4 maybe, and they had hiked rim to rim, they were on their 5th day finishing their trip.  The little girl looked tired, but I think she enjoyed herself.  They were all motivated themselves to do the last mile so they could enjoy ice cream. (the little girl was very excited about that part)  What really confused me were the people hiking down in pants and about half a bottle of water...seems silly to me.  Some had flip flops on, (ha. they weren't going very far)  Anyways, we didn't go that far down, but it was fun and beautiful.  I get to sleep in my own bed tonight (haven't since the 7th) but it was worth sleeping on the couch to see my cousins.  I want to find a way to visit them, why do these things have to be so difficult, and why does new jersey have to be about a billion miles away.  Anyways, I better get ready for bed. Good night.
