Anyway, I did not go out tonight, ate at home and tried to finish my unfinished drawing of Cardcaptor Sakura, Tomoyo and Meilin in their kimono costumes. All those Sakura fans should know which picture I am drawing and painting. It is a little bit different as I made it simpler for me to draw and paint. But on the whole, it is still alike to the original picture. I am so proud of myself ! * v * Haiz... I need to visit my Grandpa tomorrow. I kind of dread it although I used to like it very much as I can escaped from home work and watch TV. But now, I go there is like going to visit Hell -_-... Do you like it if there is an uncle telling you to lose weight the moment he sees you eating sweet stuff? I mean I am not a junk person, it just that I never exercise much, thats why I am plump. Yeah, so what he is a diabetic person? He cant just judge everything IN HIS VIEW... Jeezzz..... my temper flare everything time I go there or talk about it. But the relatives there are fine in a way... -___- So, I think you will not see me in the morning or afternoon... Hope to see you in the night and awake... MUST REMEMBER TO WATCH....  :+:  THE TWINS EFFECT  :+:   It is a vampire movie starring Hongkong famous' Twins, Ekin Cheung, Edison and Guest Appearance--- Jackie Chan. Hmmm, I like to watch vampire show about torn between love and duty and I kind of like Edison. But I am NOT like a fantic, having poster or CD or know how old he is, etc... I just like his very boyish yet mature look in every angle...^_^ But it is not coming until June, and I will be having Pratical Mock Exam =__= Haiz....
