(i was only slightly annoyed because due to people not bringing in supplies, i ended lending out all of my drawing utensils that i had explored the city to find.)   at the end of class we hung up two pieces of our work, and discussed everyone's work.  it was mostly pleasant (even though at times i wanted to shout to a pretentious class member that their work was total crap), until it got to me.  fuck.  i begin to wonder if there is something about me that just provokes art teacher meanness.  15 minutes were spent, by my prof, critiquing my choice in lines that i used for drawing a still life.  he thought it looked too comic, and that it is a good thing this is only the first class because he's going to work that out of me.   one thing i really hate about art teachers, is their want to shape you into their kind of artist instead of allowing you to be your own.   but on and on the critique flowed, even after points of people in the class being cut off for saying they liked it.  class left me in a funk, instead of feeling inspired.  add that to getting double charged to ride the over-priced subway, the evil evil snow filling up the ground, and other things..  i almost contemplated becoming one of those crazy people on the subway system.  not yet.   i'll just have to save that for another day.  but still, i would've dropped the class if i could.  (drat, drat, drat)  i hate the showing your work shame...
