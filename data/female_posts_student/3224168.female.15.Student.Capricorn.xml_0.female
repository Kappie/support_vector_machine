She just walked in that room thinking she was so cool, like she was above everyone else. She thinks getting drunk is the only worth while thing to do on earth. I take it she's never experienced much in life...and she hates me for some reason.  The thing about Laura is she's violated just about every rule in the "rules" book. Yet she still is on this course. She turns up at course stoned...does the teacher not notice? It's very obvious to me, I can smell marijuana from a mile away. One thing I really hate about Laura is how she picks on this one particular girl in my class. This girl has done nothing to her! Also...Laura's always slutting up to the guys. She does the stupidest(is that even a word?) things, like pretends to hump Gary (a dude in my class) from behind. She already has a boyfriend but of course she doesn't care. Oh and...Laura is the worst distraction ever! I have ADD(Attention Deficit Disorder) and believe me, Laura does not help it at all, she's worse than my 10 year old brother.  You know what? I hope Laura gets kicked out of course (if you're under the influence of drugs, that's instant dismissal), and I hope my  friend  (supposedly) Tara gets kicked out too. Tara's just not a nice person anymore, now that she's been hanging out with Laura. She's been leaving me out majorly! I really want to get back into contact with my friends, I haven't talked to them in ages! I used to talk to Rose and Raph all the time...but now I've just lost contact. It really sucks. They're WAY better people than Laura and Tara.
