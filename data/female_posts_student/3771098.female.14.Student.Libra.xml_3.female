Today I babysat for a few hours, then I came home, got online, read, and watched T.V. No one is home this week, they're all on vacation or out of town or something so it just generally sucks. I mean what am i supposed to do? Normally i'd be out with friends, and almost all of them can drive. Well, since they're all gone, and I can't drive, i have nowhere to go. I also don't have a job. I have got to get a job. Anyone have any suggestions? Well i'll be at IHS tomorrow helping everyone register for school. I haven't even finished my 2nd book yet. Well Amez got the lead in some play they're doing up at L-Ridge so yay for her. I get to go to church tomorrow, but i think no one will be there but that's okay, because I go for God (haha amez). Well thats all. Oh by the way, if any irmo people read this, tell me if you have any ideas about themes for field day and homecoming. Oh yeh, and if you have any ideas for our irmo vs. df t-shirt. adios  liz
