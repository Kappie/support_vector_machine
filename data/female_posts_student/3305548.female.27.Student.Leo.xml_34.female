I think the tree was lost in a storm and they hacked off the top evenly to be rid of the broken top. From there the artisan must have used lumberjack equipment or something and climbed to the top to carve this eagle. I always wonder if he knows what he is going to carve, or if he just lets it come out of the woodwork...so to speak. urlLink
