It doesn't really feel that important now, but I do feel like an elderly person looking back on their childhood years and wondering why they didn't make better use of them. Luckily, I know I still have a good bit more time left. So, my birthday has been alright. I went to Penney's this morning and found two pairs of shorts and a cute shirt, and then we went to Claire's. They had buy two get one earrings, so I got some little colored hoops and some different colored studs and some white star-shaped hoops. And I got some sunglasses too. I found some pj's and stuff at Target and then we got all of the little neccessities from Wal-Mart. I never found any tennis shoes, though. Have to keep looking.  When we got home, Mom gave me a gift basket with the Hollywood Pink perfume I've been wanting, and all the lotions and soaps that go with it. And I still have some birthday money left to take to camp with me. And, best of all, I'm not totally depressed!!!  Well, that's been my birthday. Not all that exciting, just a lot of new stuff. And now I'm going to just spend the rest of the week being impatient for camp.
