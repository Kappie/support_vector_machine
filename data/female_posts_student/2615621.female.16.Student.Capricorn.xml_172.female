I FUCKIN HATE MY COMPUTER RIGHT NOW AND IM GONNA SCREAM!! why? cuz everytime one of those "SAVE!!" popups pop the hell up they lock up my damn computer and ive liked tried to post in my blog and it wont let me cuz it locks the fuck up! and then i typed in my blog to see if it did post and it says "search..blah blah this page doesnt exsit" and im like WTF i does exsist!! i go to it every damn day! dude..ughhh. so anyways...whats new?? well...i broke another guitar string last nite tuning the damn thing. WHY?! cuz i needed a D chord..and my tuner kept saying "G flat"..."G sharp" and im like GEEZ!! I NEED A D so i keep makin it tighter and tighter since d is higher than g..and well..PING!! dammit. my damn tuner misread it. it was a D a VERY sharp D which caused it to break. UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH now i gotta go back to the music store and pay another $8 for one string. i havent told dad yet..im gonna wait until tomorrow and say it broke..i guess when i was tuning it or playing it..idk which made up story i'll use. but he'll be like WHY DO U KEEP BREAKIN UR STRINGS? haha im sure. but oh well, i'll prob give him some bullshit story about how i was told that beginers have a hard time tuning and strings get worn out easily from constantly beinging tuned. :p lol sounds believable.   mom gets back in the country tonite at midnite, but wont get home until like 2am...i was thinkin about callin her at 2:30 or 3am..but i deiced i'd call her about noon. I'm getting my pitfiul speech ready about why she needs to take me and a friend to the concert. lol i was gonna tell her that she can take john too and they can sit at the tables overlooking the lawn and me and my bud can be near the stage, but we'd have to leave after school friday and john might not be able to get off work 2hrs early..hmm...hes the manager, i bet he could lol i'll still mention john going. I CANT MISS GRAHAM COLTON BAND!!! dammit im gonna die if i dont see 'em!!  my knee is fuckin killing me. it hurts...when i go to move my leg, i can feel the bones not wanting to move with my leg. sounds weird i know, but thats what it feels like. think of someone holding ur knee straight and u trying to move ur leg around. almost a lock and pop feeling. dammit, im scared of IVs..not the cutting or the pain afterwards, they'll give me drugs for that, its the IV...lol cuz i'll have a few mins of sedative and i'll know they're puttin the IV in and flip. lol sounds like fun.  OOOH I GOT A PIC OF DANNY FINALLY!!! him and the guys (i know all of them but 1..and theres 4) decided to roll their jeans or shorts up and turn them into short shorts and run around their lil camp site or whatever so i got that pic..im sure he'd die if he knew which pic i have, but maybe not..hes hot. lol Hes not really what i pictured, i picture a dude like Taylor Kranodle or whatever lmao kranodle..dude i just screwed his name over..haha but u know who i mean lauren. him or his bro seth. i pictured their hair. Danny looks much better haha he looks like hes outta some kickass band. idk how to describe him! but hes hot. lol i'll try and send ya a pic sometime. :p   HAPPY 4TH OF JULY!! lol im going down to MTSU to see fireworks and then maybe to Nashville..exciting..oh yeah with my dad...lol im ready to come home. i need to be with people..really bad...lol   my mom better have gotten me something LV when she went..i know she did! i mean, how can u go to LV in a country where its actually affordable and not get me something?! yea..totally...lol   *much love and FIRECRACKER BOOM BOOM!!*
