VBS is good/scary. there are four boys whom i love- jacob christopher connor and brandon. most of the girls are sweet but there's a few ..interesting ones. oh well it's nice to see the little ones loving God. umm i'm really tired from all this though. i don't like waking up. it's far too early. we are supposed to go to guitar center today for my brother and i want to buy a guitar but i wouldn't mind putting the money towards a beautiful car. ha like mine would even be beautiful. but anyways, i don't really know what i'm going to do except for napping. i am going to wear one of my new thrift store shirts tomorrow to VBS. well......
