It left this huge grin on my face after reading.  Don't worry if you dont know any of the characters from the anime (Prince Of Tennis)   Warning:  It's slightly yaio/shounen ai...I hope you know what that means...  http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=1213562    Note:  Ryoma is a boy The guy mentioned at the beginning is  Momoshiro (Ryoma's senior schoolmate who has feelings for Ryoma.  He's a boy too...lol) Implied Tezuka (Tennis captain) and Fuji (Tennis Prodigy) love.  Also shounen ai (boy's love). And...if you end a person's name with sempai that means that they're your senior and that you respect them...
