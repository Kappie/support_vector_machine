Nat totally called the winner and the score.  Intense game, reminded me of State in Freshman year where me and Brittnee were having nervous breakdowns during the game.  Vinny and Marty looked adorable as usual and Nikki gave a stellar goaltending performance.  It was so nice that they weren't just another Cinderella story, this was their first time ever to get past the first round of playoffs and they went all the way to win the cup.  Dave Andreychuk finally got his Cup.  Alright so after we watched most of the celebration, we went in Nat's car to run around and scream at cars that Tampa had won.  If we screamed at your car, i'm sorry lol.  We came into contact with these middle schoolers and they were all chasing the car with their bikes and Barney was yelling "fuck you" at them....that was amusing.  Then we painted our cars with Tampa Bay stuff in celebration and we decided to have a celebration sleepover.  Jess' parents freaked out and wouldn't let her spend the night, but we still had fun even though we missed her!  We went for a candy run at like midnight and went off roading in the parking lot of middle school north.  Then we swam, stayed up until 3am and played Truth or Dare with Barney.  Oh yeah and did i mention that Barney ate like half my cake by himself....yeah he did lol  So after my wild Cup Finals night, i went to babysitting and slept while the kid played video games.  It was fun.  I get to come in late this whole week, its exciting.  alright so i think i'm going to go sleep/watch tv....i'm so tired  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
