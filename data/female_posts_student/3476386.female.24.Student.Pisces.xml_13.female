I've reada thing or two about her and how she can be, ummm, intimidating.A modern day Joan Crawford, if you will.AndI know you will. So when this wholescandal started and she had to go to court,I was kind of hoping shewould go down in flames. I thought to myself, "It wouldbe nice to see that whore Martha Stewart go to prison. That would be something." Wouldn't it? Wellnow it's a reality. I don't really feel that satisfaction that Ithought Iwould feel. What is wrong with me?? Has the hater in me subsided? Or maybe...    So it got me thinking. Perhaps Martha Stewart gets a bad rap for being aball buster, super anal, driven andall that good stuff even more so because she's a woman and she's successful. She really just knows what she wants so wedeemed hera "bitch". That's what we call most intelligent and assertive women. Like Hillary Clinton. She's a "bitch" too.    Even so, MarthaStewart still really just seems like a bitch. But that's not my point.    This whole trial is revolving around an unethical and illegal move made byStewart , butitcouldn't be any worse than what the Enron guys did. Andthen you may remember our old pals OJ andCondit. SureCondit was never deemed guilty, but then again neither was OJ, so go figure. Killing is ok, but cheating in the stock market is baaad.    Five months in prison ispretty short, but it's just long enough to take any bit of the tender ass left in herOUT. Imagine Martha after  prison if you thought she was scary now. I suppose there will be plentyof jokes we could make about her stay in prison and how shewillkeep herself busy in there witharts and crafts. I wonder if they would let her continue airing Martha StewartLiving live from prison. What a hoot that would be.    "Hello everyone. Welcome to Martha StewartLiving, the prison edition. Today my bitch andI will be showing you all how to transformthis ordinary toothbrush into a weapon. We will also be makinghomemade tampons out of paper mache and cotton. And in the last segment of our program,we willshow you how to store andsmuggle theunthinkable in your vagina."    Good times. Hey, Martha said she'd be back. I believe her too. See you in five months Martha. Staystrong girl.
