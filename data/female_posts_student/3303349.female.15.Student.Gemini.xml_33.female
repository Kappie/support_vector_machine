We made *RED* kool aid! Yeah samart idea and we walked down to Barnes and Noble which killed alot of time for which I was happy. It is always good to do stuff like that. And I made 15$! So I am that much closer to my trip to France! Fun stuff...I get to go for 3 weeks 1 week in the counrty, one week in home stays and one  wekk in Paris. And it is the chance of a life time and i would get to spend my sweet 16 there! So the whole thing is gonna rock, Well this is distracting em from talking on the phone, ha, so deepness later...
