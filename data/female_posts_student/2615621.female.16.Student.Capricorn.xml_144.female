Remember me telling about the dude who used to sit behind me in church and i'd turn around all the time and look at him?? haha well..he hasnt been in church for like weeks, so i was all bummed that i wouldnt get my final last look, but he was there tonite. i figured out he has been workin in the control room, therefore not sitting behind me. Well, the control room is in the balcony of the church and thats where dad and i sat...so i see him and im like :o omg! haha so im totally checkin him out and hes lookin soo hot in a black Fender shirt and jeans..and brown flip flops..so i say OMG DAD! THATS "HIM"!! and dad wanted to see him, so we both leaned forward to lookin into the control room window..and just as we lean forward he turns and sees us! hahaha i jumped back and looked the other way, but dad cracked up and was like omg julia..hahahahah HAHAHAHA u just got caught! so..i had to live with him catching me for literally the hundredth time..lol so..hes hot..haha do u blame me? no and im never gonna see him again! haha i should have talked to him..dammit! anyways..on the way home i saw a sign that said "davey crockett" so i started singing "here comes davey crockett comin down mt. trail!!" and my dad was like--umm julia, thats peter cotton tail...OOPs my bad. sorry, am i suppose to know the damn D.C song? didnt think so...  its now 12:04 here...1:04 back home, and i still havent packed my shit up. oh well.. i gotta get up at 5:30...and leave by 7am...fun stuff! im soo excited though! i do really need to pack..ive been saying that all day though.  Kaela is prob gonna spend the nite and we're going to a baseball game and we might stop by zack's and say hey to everyone..i really want a cigarette, but i know kaela would kill me if she knew i was smoking. okay, once she was like "oo julia, i wanna try a cig, can i have one?" so i stole some and we smoked..then i started smoking with friends and she got all mad..well fuck that. lol i happen to like to smoke, but i just dont have any cigs..katie told me zack bought some at a little country store by sweet talking the lady about how he was really 18 but left his id at home and put on an accent..hahaha thats funny, now i have someone to buy me cigs. haha now i really will turn into a smoker.   Lauren..heres an offer u cant pass up...u, me at sarah sampson's house..guys...alcohol, cigs, and pot if u want LMAO baby..omg its all right there in front of us..we just gotta grab it like morons. ..so maybe thats not the smartest thing to write about on my blog..but u know, its the truth..im a curious lil beeyatch and...yea...lol so lauren, u game? i dont wanna take katie, 1) i know she wont go, she'll just pretend like she is and 2) tha guys will all like her....hell, they'll prob like u. but the only thing about these guys...they want some, even if its just makingout..so be prepared to prob hook up with someone...but then again, u never know, sarah hasnt hooked up with anyone in a while at her house. i just asked jordan childress if he wanted to go with me..cuz we never spend any time together and hes into all of that..he told me "sorry i gotta work bud". shit..i rather have lauren anyways! lol i love ya lauren! :D   Okay..im done looking like a totally dumbass idiot on my own fuckin blog now..  *much love and MAYBERRY here i come!*
