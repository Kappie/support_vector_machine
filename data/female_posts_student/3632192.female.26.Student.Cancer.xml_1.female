I like the music she plays and mostly the lyrics which make great sense.  I love to listen to her music because she has the talent to write her lyrics connecting to real world issues.  There are some days when you just feel so down for no reason and this is when I mostly listen to her songs. Because it makes me wonder about various things which will never occur to me at all.  It makes me think it is not only me who is feeling like this or I am not only the one who goes through situations.  Ironic is the best!!!  I don’t like techno that much but I like this one song “Northern Lights” by Enigma .  I like to listen to this when I am playing a computer game or when I go to the gym. The beat itself hits right to your head that it feels like riding a trailer on a highway.      Also I like songs by Five for fighting and my favorite is “Superman”.  It is hard to live according to everyone’s expectations.  I guess all of us go through the phase of trying to satisfy someone’s dream.  The lyrics say  “It may sound absurd...but don't be naive Even Heroes have the right to bleed, I may be disturbed...but won't you concede, Even Heroes have the right to dream, It's not easy to be me ….” .  The music is soothing to listen to, when you are stressed out with school work and   other things.
