George Pocock  ******************************************************* in a drunken sky an ominous shadow appears. your ghost of past lurking at the foot of your bed. memories fog over blurring fantasy with reality. you can no longer believe what you once thought was true.  ******************************************************** i stand alone in a long forgotten corridor. matte white paper clutched in my trembling hand. told to meet. told to wait. anticipation stabs at my lungs. arythmia inducing memories. tears flow carrying mascara along. a foot step is heard. jagged breathing ensues. dreams and second thoughts bombard. subconcious steps bacwards. fears tear through. realizations come to light. and long forgotten corridor must stay so, as a matte white paper falls from resolved hands.
