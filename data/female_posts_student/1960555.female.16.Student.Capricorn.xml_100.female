(for all y'all who are holding your breath to see who i slept with, you'll be sorely dissapointed)  i went to my aunt and uncle's for a barbeque and my cousin's boyfriend had his friend over.  he was just this insanely nice guy who was also freaky bright (litterally and figurativly)  he was wearing a netherland's soccer jersey (neon orange) and he knew something about nearly everything.  he was my suprise.  i learned so much tonight.  oh, and he had 3 wicked leg tattoos.  he had a skeleton on one calf and a viking on the other with a little thumbs up hand on this shin.  i was in a neon orange heaven.  and freaking portugal won tonight!  which is really funny because i was watching it with ryan and corey who were both for the netherlands.  muahahahaha.  it was hilarious.  i'd cheer, they'd cry.  they'd cheer, i'd mope.  good times.  then there's my cousin dea who's like "so who wants another beer??"  gawd good times.  and we finally got our cd player put in the car which my muther promptly buggered up, but manda to the rescue.  i fixed it no prob.  i fixed it WITHOUT the mannual whereas my muther wrecked it WITH the mannual!  it's insanity.
