But yet I am out of the loop and all I know to talk about is camp that's all I have done all summer long and that's as far as my life goes!   It's hard to sit there and talk about anything but camp. Tonight I went on a long walk with Michelle one of my best friends and it was the greatest walk ever. We talked and I talked like I had a best friend again and it was great I feel better about everything and I am just so happy! It feels weird being at home on a Thursday and everyone else is at camp and I am doing dick all wow is it great though!!!! I am super happy and life is going good.   My day was great I realized what I don't miss about some people and how much I really miss all of them. Now I am crying because I missed them so much! I really need to see Taylor, Regan, Rory, and Braden A.S.A.P.! I haven't and I miss them and I love them and I miss them!!! LOL and Jackie I can't forget Jackie!   HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHRIS!!!!!!! I AM THE FIRST TO WISH YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!! I LOVE YOU MAN AND NOW YOUR 16 JESSICA ISN'T OLD ANYMORE!!!!! LOL   Oh so I hear the lakeshore guys didn't get out of Regina until 12:30 - 1:00ish that's pretty funny since they wanted to leave last night! LOL I hope they are having fun though! It must be a party! Or a riot! LOL   Jackie, Ashley, Rhiannon, Michelle, Megan, Taylor, Braden, Chris, Josh, Regan, Rory, Christine, Lisa, Cortney, Conno, Alex, Spencer, Devin, Jessica, Derek, Craig,Zach, Mark, Shawnand Lunchbox. I decide that tomorrow night I am going to have people over for a fire in my back yard I will be getting marshmallows so come over around 8ish and we will hang out talk and just relax in my back yard. If you have any lawn chairs make sure you bring them alright? deal-o? Oh and if I missed anyone let them know. I am out have a good night!  Later Gator
