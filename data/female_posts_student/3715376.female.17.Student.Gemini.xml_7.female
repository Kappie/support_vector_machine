They were both very sweet girls, and only laughed when it was discovered that Claire and I had... well... 're-arranged' the pizzas we had bought for lunch. Ok... I know the simple rules of gravity say that when you hold a pizza on a right-angle degree, the topping will fall off, but we weren't exactly thinking about gravity when we needed ot figure out a way to transport the pizzas from the store to louise's house on bikes... anyway... it was kinda funny... :D  Anyway, the two girls, Julie and Louise were both really sweet. And Louise has this huge-ass oversized greyhound which is sooo soo cute!   So after that I went home and got ready for the Rotary meeting that night. 3½ hours of wholesome Rotary fun.... yeah as if! no, it really wasn't too bad, in fact, I actually kind of enjoyed it! I spent most of the meeting talking to an old Norwegian guy in Danish... which was funny because my danish is soooo bad. And then I spoke to the lady who was Emily (the last exchange student with the Tårnby Rotary Club) and she was soo nice and said she would invite me over to her house one weekend, which I am looking foreward to because she was cool.   Anyway, signing off for now  Captain Katie
