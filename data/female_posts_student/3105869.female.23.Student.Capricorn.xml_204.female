I decided I was dying and didn't want to speed up the process unnecessarily by trekking through Innsbruck to school.  Okay, Okay I don't really trek either, I more like stroll to the bus stop, wait and ride to school.  Beautiful.  Anyway, so in an effort to make up for my uncontrollable ranting yesterday, here are some pics, I'll start with good 'ol Innsbruck and then to Bratislava, the place I hope to one day own a summer home in...  And yes I am okay, I think, no, yes, I am okay!
