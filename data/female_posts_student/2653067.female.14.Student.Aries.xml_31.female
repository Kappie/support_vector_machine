I couldn't get a hold of michele so I doubt that she'll be comming over today.  On top of feeling kinda sick, I also have lots of homework to do so seeing friends this weekend is out of the question.  I hope I'll feel better tomorrow.  I kinda feel alone right now. I haven't spoken to any friends for a while.  I think I'll call them later on tonight.  A part of me feels bored but the other part of me feels tired and sick.  I have something to look forwards to though.. the webcam.  The big sale at future shop has been pushed back and will end on the 15th.  Hopefully I'll have enough money by then!  Anyways, I think I'll go and sit out in the sun and read a book, I hear the sun is good for you when you feel ill.
