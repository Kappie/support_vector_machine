I just hope there is not too much stuff on the test monday.  And well my mom is going to apply for a job opening at my school which is the textbook rental assistant which I actually think that would be like sooooo totally cool is she was.  And well I went shopping tonight man that was fun.  I bought a shirt and skirt, new jeans, and purple pants with my left over b-day money from August!  And I fit into a size 10 - I think I am gonna faint!  I used to be like size 14-15 man this is sooooo sweet I was like drowning in the 12's too.  So well I had a little treat tonight I got one of those twisty cones from mcdonalds besides on of those ain't gonna make weight gain happen over night and well I am just makin sure I am balancing the fruit intake w/ the junk intake.  Lol and well man I have sooo much social to do and I still have to finish my long answer question answers before I can memorize em' for the test so that is what I really need to go do now.
