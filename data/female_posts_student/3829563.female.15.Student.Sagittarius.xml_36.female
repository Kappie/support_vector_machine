The tea lady (i think) just sprayed some weird air freshner thing and I am gagging like a chipmunk. hyuk hyuk hyuk. next year i am definetly not gonna pick an office job. and I defintely do not see myself working (10 years down the road) in some white... boring, old office with like cabinets full of weird folders. nnnnno. never. I see myself up on a stage with Hilary and Colleen by my side rocking to the sounds of Le Blachi Cameleons. HA HA HA. either that or running around killing rats. WACHA! speaking of the band, hilary go check our blog, unless you havent done so already. i have laid out a brilliant plan ahead of us. MWA HA HA HA HA HA.  anyway, plan for the day. finish up my work here, wait till mom calls, go out for lunch (with mom). AHH. I'm sure it will be a real bonding experience = I hope we go someplace nice. I am so very bored, and hungry. Okay I should probably get off this before I get murdered.
