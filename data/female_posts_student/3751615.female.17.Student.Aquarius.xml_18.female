No wonder, coz i'd just had my eyes shut at 6 am, which means two and a half hours before i woke up this morning! I've had it for these past few days... insomnia! I thought it's because of my jet lag... but its been almost 3 weeks after my flight from London to Jakarta! He he... crazy me if still think that jet lag is the cause of my old insomnia :D  Havent changed loads the situation today is... still havent talked with mom and dad, and ttoday is the 5th day! even i havent met them since 2 days ago. I spent 90 % of the day in my room... quite fun! I play Minesweeper much better now :) Cant make my self not crying though if i listen to a mellow song with a touchy lyric... i loath this feeling! Mom did well to make me feel worthless and useless. At this moment, outside of my bedroom door... mom, dad, Avi, and Jodi are laughing and talking bout Jodi's first marching band performance tomorrow  (Note :For newbie readers :) Avi is my younger sister and Jodi is my younger brother)  . Hell.. it feels so hurt when i start to think that they're all much happier without me among them! Those laughs... gosh, dont they know that i'm here crying?  Aargh... gotta make my self better by now! still cant forget the things mom said to me 5 days ago... i've been trying to forget about that coz i know it would make me a lil bit fine... but how i can forget that someone who i thought was my mom this far told me that i havent got parents?! Though someday we talk again... its never gonna be the same!  Well... stop talkin' bout those stuffs! dont wanna cry again :) i should make a way to recylce my tears unless my tears would have run dry ^_^ Neway, tonight... the big match of EURO! England and Portugal! Carl (my ex teacher) said that he's sure England will win the match, 2-0! Gee... cant believe that Carl is still remember that he's a british man! I think the same way actually... wish dat england would win the game! Portugal isnt bad as well! My score prediction isnt as cruel as Carl's. at least 2-1 for England to go to semi final.  Okies.. dats all. I gotta think about things i should do tomorrow. Talking bout things i should do... i forgot that i should've gone to the bank this morning! And one more... i havent done my laundry yet (its a whole week laundry). Dunno wat should i wear tomorrow!! :( Good nite....     June 25 2004, Friday   God natt min dagbok... friday night is now. Wanna go and chill out with sum pals actually, but i cant! here i am with my dying laptop (havent charged it)on my bed... So far so good. I went to the bank this morning. Guess what? I arrived at 7.30 and the bank was about to open at 8 am! gotta wait 30 minutes in the car then... i hate waiting! I've done my laundry and luckily i've still got sum pairs of clothes left for today! he he... not that bad, but nearly!  Erick called this morning  (Note : Frederick a.k.a Erick a.k.a Fred a.k.a Freddie a.k.a any names you wanna call him with is my foster brother, 7 years older)).  I was driving on the free way when he rang me. He hasnt come home yet... Erick needs some pictures for his proffesor in Seattle then he went outta town 4 days a go to get the pictures. It was a short conversation. Just a sentence from him... "Icke gör det lov husen" which means do not ever try to leave the house. Living in da same place for 17 years has made him know me so well I guess :) Something that maybe mom cant do, or maybe just even try! I was planning to go out if the house really... but dad took my passport. What can i do without my passport?  The rest of the day was just fun... and guess what? England lost to Portugal. Penalty... David "The Star" Beckham couldnt even do that 100 % guarantee will be a goal kick! He's paid too much! Poor Carl... football is everything for most of da british. Hope he's strong enough to face the reality... :)  Nothing else to say and the laptop would be really die (forever) if i don't stop. See ya tomorrow nite....    June 26 2004, Saturday   Saturday is always be my favorite day!!! I'm absolutely happy today. Go out with my best pal. She was looking for a birthday present to be given to her cousin. A good chance for me to go out... i felt the air was so fresh. i forgot all of the bad stuffs at home.  I bought a new shirt. Just a few months before i go to my new school (a university actually, but i dont like to call it so) and i need some new clothes. Bussines look preffered, as the regulations book told. The reason i bought da shirt is because i thought i saw Gareth Gates wore that kind of shirt in a photo shoot. Gotta have it then...  Good news i wanna tell... coz of i'm outside of the house for almost one full day, i'm not crying much today! Well, i cried only once! when someone who i thought was my mom told me that i'm such a person with no responsible! Gee... cant believe that for sure! She doesnt even knoe what is the colour of my eyes! how could she tell me that i'm not having responsibility?  Erick will be home tomorrow and hopefully i'm gonna be better if he's home! and  tonite... match between Sverige and Netherland. Wish dat Anders Svensson will play well and bring Sverige to semi final! gå Sverige! Sverige är antal en!   June 27 2004, Sunday  Well... Sunday has come and nearly over! not a good Sunday this time... some relatives came and they're totally noisy! Dont hate them though... but I need more sleep today! Havent slept since 3 days ago... so tons of stones are covering my eyes now... so difficult to get my eyes opened. Besides... Sverige lost! I cried... Spannen spillt mycket väl. Cant believe they lost. They're so unlucky... penalty never be good!  I just spent my times talking, watching tv, and sleeping today. All done in my room. Neway, i feel more like stranger in my own house. Even I cant talk the way i used to talk with my brothers and sister. Just to Erick i feel comfy to tell all the things i'm feeling rite now. And Erick is great brother (honestly, i've just realized that) we spent a few hours in the morning talking in my room and i felt glad that Erick was there.  Still bout Anders Svensson... he's cute! Just like any other Swedish team players. He he .. dats why i dont want the team come home earlier so i'm able to see those cute faces on tv!  Not many else... i'm gonna go to a bookshop tomorrow. I'll go to buys load of romantic novels... i'm using the time when my sensitive barometer has overed it limits. I'm gonna cry as much as i want now... try not caused by sadness but cause of something romantic. And next will pray that someday one of the action will happen in my life... :)
