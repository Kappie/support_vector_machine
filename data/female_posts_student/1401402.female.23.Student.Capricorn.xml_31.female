I did not go out; I did not do anything last night. Although I was up until 10:30 watching my Thai movies.   I need some coffee. God damn Star Bucks was not open when I road by this morning at five thirty. I will try again before eight tho. I am about to just crash onto my keyboard and go to sleep. Sleep is all I can think of. Only if that were an option I would do it. The lazy drip of Sakdary.    I cannot blog damn I just cannot. A co-worker has just asked me a question and I went blank. I know she was talking to me but all I got was the mouth moving with no sound. Lol, I am sorry I am not quite awake yet. This is so hard and I cannot stay focus on doing my work shit.   Great now my stomach is growling. I am hungry damnit. I want to go back to sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. I’m so sleepy and starving.
