"Lonely paranoid techie" sounds like a caricature but probably used for good comic effect if this is anything like Kunzru's debut,  urlLink  The Impressionist  .      urlLink  The Coma   by the  urlLink not unsightly Alex Garland . I couldn't even finish Garland's last novel,  urlLink  The Tesseract  , but I think he's back, after writing the very creepy  urlLink  28 Days Later  . Plus it's just 144 pages with illustrations, perfect for a one-afternoon read.      urlLink  American Desert  , by Percival Everett. A ghost story by the brilliant author of  urlLink  Erasure  .      urlLink  The Plumber of Souls   by Michael Guinzburg. I just picked this one up at the bookstore without ever reading a review but it involves a priest, a software mogul who makes illegal clones to be his companions, and people who marry their Mad-cow disease ravaged  cows .      urlLink  A Private Life   by Chen Ran. A coming-of-age story set in the era of the Tian'anmen Square demonstrations.      urlLink  What Really Happened to the Class of '93   by Chris Colin. Colin tracked down twenty people from his high school class, shortly before their 10 year reunion to see what had become of their lives. Do you think maybe  everything had changed  and yet at the same time,  nothing had changed at all ? Me too, but I still can't resist.       urlLink  Feed  , by M.T. Anderson. I'm going to pretend this is a recommendation from our  urlLink resident teen  but how can anyone not like a book where kids go to the Moon for Spring Break and have a constant stream of data fed to them so they don't have to read or write or even think? Kind of like now, only without keyboards and monitors.  I can't wait for  urlLink Google  to make this a reality.       urlLink  Sixteen  , edited by Megan McCafferty. I like YA fiction, you have a problem with that? Actually there are some funny stories in here by  urlLink  Candyfreak  Steve Almond  and  urlLink super-chill Ned Vizzini .
