In the spirit of Wine Tasting Wednesdays, I did my best last night to drink too much and sleep too little on a weekday.  To start the day off right, massive storms in Cleburne had rendered the A/C in our building useless, but spared the lights.  So we could work, but in miserable conditions.  Yesterday in Cleburne was 95 with a heat index of 100 and humidity of about 200%.  I think I know what it feels like to work in a sweatshop now.  So after my ten hours of pore-cleansing steam room treatment, you can imagine how ready I was for a nice frosty beverage at everyone’s favorite establishment, the Lakeside Tavern (not to diminish the greatness of the Lake Brazos Steakhouse).  Cross Canadian Ragweed was playing and the little tavern sold out.  I felt like a parent watching their child graduate.  It was a great show and I had several random encounters with people I hadn’t seen in a while—some I was glad to see, others not so much.  The list of run-ins included my pickup salesman (good), a friend from my days in Bellmead (also good), an ex-boyfriend who is now married (odd), and another friend who is now a bartender (very good).    The rain held off until the very end of the show, but the storms were getting pretty close by dark.  I had images of the crowd getting collectively struck by lightning like the herd of cattle in Lonesome Dove.  The rest of the night included driving to Whitney in a monsoon, not believing that my passenger was actually a law enforcement official (he was), then trying very very hard not to swerve drunkenly.       I finally weenied out at about 1:30.  Ambitiously, I set my alarm for 5:00 but didn’t get up until 6:30.  My wonderful hostess had not only set the coffee pot timer for me, but had also rounded up all the makeup, hair products, and clothing I would need for today, too.  So I didn’t look as scary as I could have when I dragged into work only ten minutes late.  I would have probably been on time if I could have figured out how to get out of Cyndi's house.  I walked into the master bedroom, the garage, and two closets before giving up and going out the back door.  The air conditioner is still out, and the temperature is starting to creep up, which does not bode well for my afternoon.  I’ve spent the last 6 hours feeling like I stood up way too fast, only while sitting down.  I seriously doubt that adding heat to this equation will help.  Random tidbit:  I’m wearing a suit that is all one piece, with a sleeveless top attached to shorts.  Meaning you can’t simply remove the shorts, you have to take off the entire outfit.  When I went to the bathroom earlier, I had the unique experience of being completely undressed at work, something I’m proud to say I had never done before.  Guess I can check off office nudity on my "to do before age 30" list.
