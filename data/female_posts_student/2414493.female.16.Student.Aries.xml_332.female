It's not even like I went to bed too late (the last time I looked at the clock it was 12:48 am over here) and it's not like I'm doing strenuous exercise every day. Nonetheless, I just got up from a nap, and it's back to reading.  I don't know if dissatisfaction's the word, but anthro gets more sluggish and unfulfilling every day. Or maybe it's simply because I haven't been putting in what I should be putting in. The midterm's tomorrow, and I realized, while sitting at a worktable at Lamont, that it's really not that bad: there's going to be ID questions, one short essay and one long one. I guess I just have to find the major themes and write about them...I might want to start on myth, culture and ritual. I just really want to do well to get myself some sort of comfortable footing in this class, but somehow I'm just so darn tired too.   In an effort to keep myself awake (mission aborted), I have discovered that coffee frappuccinos are good.  And it's time for dinner. Only more studying lies ahead. That, and Kafka reading. Sigh.
