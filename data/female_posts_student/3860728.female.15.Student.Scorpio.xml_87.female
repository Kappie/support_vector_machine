I went back upstairs and let Sunny on the computer. I turned off the cookies un purpose so he couldn't do anything therefore he got off the computer quickly. I went in the bathroom and tried to pop this zit. It started to bleed. You can hardly tell it's there though so i may be able to leave the house soon. I suppose i'll call ashley today. Yes I SHALL. And i'll call amber too. Uhhh.... found a post about this racist ranting about women dating black/hispanic/middle eastern and asian guys saying the mix races. #1 women in general are not only white.. they're black/hispanic/middle eastern and asian too. #2 who gives a fuck? Ummmm.. tiz all for now i suppose.
