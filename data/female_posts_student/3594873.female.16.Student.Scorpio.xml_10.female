The word is obviously made up of two words: extra, and ordinary. We all know that the word extra means more. If we substitute the word more in the word extraordinary we get: moreordinary. Moreordinary? I mean, what’s up with that? Doesn’t more ordinary sound like the most ordinary instead of beyond ordinary. Maybe, it’s just me…well you know what they say: Geniuses are never satisfied, to criticize and find fault is their habit.  if you say that you do know that saying than you’re really really weird because I just made that up.  Actually once a couple of years ago this weird thing happened.  I swear it’s true. See, I sorta wrote my friend’s homework for her. We had to write short poems and so I kinda wrote one for her and she turned it in. you know what the teacher wrote back? Do not copy poems, and she wrote the title of some poem. I swear! I’m like, errrm, umm, okay so she cheated but she did not COPY a poem. I made it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyways, what happened today was most unusual: quite extraordinary. It was to put it bluntly, something that has led me to believe in the goodness of people again. Ahhh, you’re tired. You want us to just blurt it out. But no, one can never tell a story from the end. And that is why I will have to start at the beginning.   As most of you know: we’ve entered this contest with our sis and her friend. Who ever loses the most weight gets a NICE GIFT. SO, we’ve basically been starving ourselves for the past two days. Well, today we were surfing the Internet and we found out that: THAT’S BAD!! So we started eating again. But then, Salma was fasting. And so we had to eat AGAIN!! That’s why after maghrib we decided to go walking. To lose weight.  So we started out and everything was going fine UNTIL: ahmed started complaining. Thankfully our mom came and picked us up. Then our family decided to go buy ice cream. AND that’s where trouble began.   After we’d finished our ice creams, my mom slammed the car into the raseef/ side walk. The wheel drowned in the sand and to put it frankly: we were stuck! So we called up our daddyo and just stood there, looking like 4 damsels in distress. Now here’s the kewl part.  ALL THESE PEOPLE STOPPED TO HELP US!! I mean loads of people. Cars just kept stopping and looking and trying to figure out how to get the car out. Especially this one determined man. Insha Allah, he’ll go to heaven. WE’ll we were starting to get pretty desperate because nothing was working, but then finally: the car was on the street again!! Yay, alhamidulla.  *Even if any of you read this from Salma’s blog: I know ours is better!! It has to be! Hers is probably to short. I’m sure it is. :D ;D  * riddle: when is a door, not a door?    when it is ajar...hahhaa...hahahha..HEhahEhahesheshe Lol! *start laughing peoples*. i saw this riddle in a movie...called Bartok the Magnificent. yes, yes, it was a cartoon. sue me!  the name is banwan. banwan mariam and amina signing off. (think bond)  PoSted.
