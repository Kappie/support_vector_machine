Like how you play the ping game when you look at people at the end of exams. *you can ping off people to see who they're looking at, and then who that person is looking at until you hit a wall or a clock...* Ping cause of computer stuff. And you can write about your true love: Karl the gay knome. Gnome? Where did knome come from? Oops 6 hours sleep not good. Anyway... that's enough random crap for today I have to save if for exams! *yup RE was one big block of random crap* Like history... how are we going to survive?
