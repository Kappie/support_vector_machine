I seriously don't want to fail those classes, and I didn't do to well on either final.  I know for sure I failed my Spanish final... I had an A- let's see what happens.  Tomorrow is my last day of school, then I'll be a senior!!  I'm so excited (and I just can't hide it).  Then I might get to take my driving test on Friday if I'm lucky and there isn't a lot of people there.  wOOt!!  Mom comes back from her business trip in Florida late tonight.  She had fun.  Went down a water slide, all is good.  It had been in the 80s here for like the past week and then today it got crappy...  AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  Summer vacation is almost here. weeeee!!!!  And I need some major money.  meh, that's about it that's going on with me though.  So there Nicky, have a crappy update.  Nothing goes on in my life so it's hard.  ok no more babbling. later dayz
