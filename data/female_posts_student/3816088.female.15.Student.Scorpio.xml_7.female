Even though me and Mariah almost skipped but we didnt because Kelly kinda dragged us in there so we had to go. But then afterwards I pulled a big fib but let me tell you it was well worth it!! I dont know it i want to go into detail but Ill just say I had a great night and Im just going to leave it at that!! I love you guys!! heather
