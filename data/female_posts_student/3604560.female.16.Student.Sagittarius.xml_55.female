Gross.   Good on ya Div, I love Pay It Forward, even if Mel disagrees. And it's Tamara who's going out with Kyle =D See? I listen to 2dayfm hehehe And congrats to Zheng for getting her L's. I've decided not to get my L's simply cos of 2 reasons. My mom and dad both don't wanna take me out in their "pretty new" cars just in case I scratch it or something and I just can't be bothered to read the book or do those online test thingys. Besides, I'm sure we've got enough drivers in our group - but is there anyone who is actually safe enough to get in the same car as???  I'm still stuck on Pride and Prejudice. Actually, I haven't touched it at all hehehe oops. I think I'll just watch the video and that's it. I tried to rent it but all the copies are out =( But I did rent Cheaper By The Dozen, Chasing Liberty, Enough, Insomnia, Along Came Polly, Love Actually, 8 Mile, I Am Sam, The Man Who Sued God and Shrek 2 (shh, it's pirate). And Mel, you may NOT comment on those video choices.   I went ice skating at Macquarie the other day. It was like fully packed and towards the end, the ice was like fully melting and so the middle was like an island. My friend won the limbo thing and got this lunchbox cooler. It was like soooo low that I don't think majority of us would have fit even lying face down in the ice. But then again, he was only 9. Oh, and I didn't fall once =D Pretty good effort considering it was only my second time ice skating, and I even helped some little kids who were crying cos they couldn't skate without falling. How cute =P  Anyways, I think I'll just do one of those random post thingys every so often =P But if you're bored, you can visit my other journal www.livejournal.com/users/martinaho Cheers!
