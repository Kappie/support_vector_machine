These arse thingys are like the high tech heroin cos u get so addicited to them and depend on them so much that when they fail on u, ur whole world crumples n sends u in " cold-turkey" syndrome; the cursing, swearing,   SWEATING, palpitations..well u know the works. I typed like a 1000 word essay on my blog the other day pouring out my lungs and my intestines and then when I hit THAT post n publish button,   MY   FARKING   MODEM   BROKE   DOWN!!!!  !~@$#@^$%!#$  I was so pissed. I just shut down when all my applications are still running.  Really damn tmd.  Ok fine. I swear like a guy. I'm just a guy trapped in a woman's body.  I'm suppose to studying now. Got a practical theory test (???) later at 10am. U see the irony of tertiary institutes? I can't fathom the meaning of a PRACTICAL theory test. Tot it's supposed to be a practical test  *lost for words*  Well, I'm totally restless now. Can't get to studying. My mind is at it again. It's the brain farking mode again. Getting too frequent these weeks. Bog me down spiritually and mentally. LaNz. I'm forever now feeling so bloody tired. So always always drain. I dun attend lectures anymore( err ok lah, still got attend but absentees increasing) but yet I felt no guilt and I dun give a bloody damn.  Now u know how bad this brain farking thing is affecting me. I slept like 3 hours earlier on and frivolously, I woke up with a start and scramble to chk out the alarm clock.   HOLY FARK! It was 7!!!  Then I realised...KNS it's 7PM. I felt as though I slept so long, I slept through the entire night. And at that instance, where I thought I'm supposed to feel energized. I was hit by a huge wave of fatigue. I was totally flabbergasted. PIangs.. I just woke up. But I still felt as though I ran 24 KM. IRONY.  And now after a cup of coffee (again). I felt jittery and STILL unwilling to settle down to study. Oh well.. I'm just a pain in the arse. It's always like that. Dun study..yadah yadah, stay up late dunno doing wat..procrastinate and pretend to study...yadah yadah and then that's it. Not prepared for test and then feel like shit after the whole damn thing.  the cycle reiterates.   I tink i'm really one of a kind of slow kuku that enjoys farking myself again and again by my own nonsensical and brainless doings. Hahahah  Din go to sch today. Why? errrr....hmmm.. dunno. Too konk out the previous nite I guess. Din feel like doing anything in the morning. Went to take passport sized pictures for my resume. Damn I look like shit. The picture looks as though I was falling asleep while the uncle took my picture. It costs me 8 bucks. Oh well. Much cheaper than what my frens wanted to do. They were contemplating to go to the digital foto shop at suntec to get their pictures taken. It's like wat? 18 bucks without touch up and I tink only about 5 pictures? and 30 bucks to touch up.    !!!!!!!!!!  Ah, dunno lah. Maybe my priority is not to look so goot in the pictures- Oh well..I just let my natural beauty show.  AHHAHAHAAH ( I also find that a tad too amusing)  Ok la, 3rd attempt to study now. Maybe I will blog again later.  Oh yea! Bf coming back today. Heh. Long time no see him..that poor soul is freaky sick over at Surabaya. Poor thing.. Will sayang him later when I see him. Tsk  Better stop blabbering liao lah. My fingers also cramp typing so much.  tata
