They r pretty random.not as random as aphex twin (inthink that is wot thry r called) simon had it on the other day, sounds like a cartoon character thing. Like music from a ps2 game or sommit.lol     DITA! :D              Anywayz on2 the big story or THE PR  OM. Well there isn’t a big story really- I wldnt say no major cock ups or fallins out, so it wldnt hav made a gd eastenders episode ( there is such thing as a good east enders episode I hear u cry-lol) every1 did look amazing. Natalie looked soooooooo beautiful,(and I am havin no word from u (nat) asyin that u didn’t…cos u did :FACT :P lol. Cat looked amazing, merel looked like a little princess, alex looked so vampy and truly astounded my, shelley looked so pretty in her dress, I love the colour so much, loiuse looked realy pretty and every1 else looked amazing. Even the guys looked pretty gd, joe and his tied back hair looking very swarve.lol- adam (g) looked pretty dapper as well. There was something goin on with dan tho. I mean everytime   I saw him he was dancing with a different girl!lol     The limo was really cool- nat and shelley came 2 mine , and we started the evening with some wine, I only had three glasses, but in the space of about 40 mins-lol, was such a nice evening as well. Claire said 2 grab som cds….so I did, about 10 just kinda random and I cam out with this bag and was like, well u asked me 2 grab some- was good tho- we eneded up stopping as mcdonalds tho, not 2 get some food, cos we needed the toilet, no theres me louise, Claire and chloe walkin through mcdonalds in our prom dress with every1 staring and that headin 4 the loo. Then on the way back clair said is that ur garter, pointing 2 the floor, and it must hav fallen down, so I kinda just put it back on…in the middle of the car par… not very classy or lady like but at that point I didn’t really care.ah well, we ended up turning up 2 the prom with muse playin and there were som many ppl   out side waitin 2 go in and ppl who had come 2 c the ppl goin in. buts anywayz there was some dancing, and chattin and just kinda messin about. And then it was all over. Ont the way back in the limo we had chop suey and me and alex kinda singin cos we knew all the words. I do feel it was a bit expensive 4 wot it was. Mean the place looked great and that, but it only lasted 3 ½ hours, half an hour of that ppl were outside. M not sayin I regretted goin or anything like that cos I loved the dressin up and all that and the excitement of the day and building up 2 it just well…was a bit expensive, but anywayz i had a good time     ive put all my pics in my wall, there r about 70 of them-lol - showed simon yesterday and he jsut went wOlol might out all my prom ones up wen i get them developed.      well thats enough of me-talk 2 every1 soon :D
