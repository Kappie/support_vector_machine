The core of every Disney Channel Original Movie and/or Original Series is to have the main characters be 3 best friends. 2 being of one gender and the other of course being the opposite gender of the other two. Two people must be of the same race and the remaining will be of a different race and/or gender. Case in point Lizzie McGuire. Lizzie is white, best friend Miranda is hispanic, other best friend Gordo is a guy and Jewish. That's So Raven, black girl, best friend is white, other best friend, black and male. It's a pattern.
