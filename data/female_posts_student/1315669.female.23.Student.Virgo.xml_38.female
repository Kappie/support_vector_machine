But it taste like baileys..though it has more of the coffee essence in it.   Aint feeling good these days though..I guess it sort of exacerbated during my aussie trip. I can't pinpt that feeling..it's like muffled and well I'm slow to react and slow to come to a realization abt anything that I'm bothered with until it's a tad erm...late. What I meant by not feeling goot means I feel empty, perhaps lonely sometimes. I felt a loss in a meaning of life. There's this sort of nagging yet indistict voice in me telling me that there are paramount errands that requires my attn now but I can't seemed to pin point out what are the errands and what I'm suppose to do. Though the nagging urge to attend to them is strong.   Nowadays( well I mean for the past month or so), I get hit by waves of nostalgia at times when I least expect them. Like when the bus goes past somerset station I will think of certain bitter memories of a certain someone. It was subconscious no doubt.. I din will myself to think. Or sometimes when I look at couples, I will think of my baby and I yearn for him to hold me the way they do. It's strange cos I'm happily attached. I dun understand the waves of melancholy and abrupt change in my emotions. Perhaps that's natural; a sort of phase but I guess my other side of a woman's insitnct or the side which knows myself better tells me there's more to that. I dun fully know the ans.   On the contrary I'm not saying I'm worse than before. I'm definitely much better. I am happier and I feel more exertive than I was before. Yet, there is something very mojor in myself; a part of myself I need to alter; to conform and to recognize soon or I will see doom. That itself is scary because it's like the calm before a storm; everything is supposedly wonderful BUT..there's the but; like why I'm feeling this wat? Why I'm behaving this way? It's like the manifestations of the undercurrent in the murky calm waters.   I have been having weird dreams lately too. Sometimes they are nightmares..and theoir frequencies are increasing in magnitude. I sometimes get awoken in the dead of the night suddenly yet not due to bad dreams. But my body just wun rest. Maybe it's my diet. My lifestyle. I'm so dead inside sometimes. Haha. Oh well... sighz... I shall pray and ask for God to show me what it was that I should really do.   I guess this is one of the entries that is closet to me being as honest as I can..
