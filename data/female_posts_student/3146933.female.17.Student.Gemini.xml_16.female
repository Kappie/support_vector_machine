Patrick Hall asked me and Monica to come see their band play at their church...Section Church of God...they did SO great! And...their dramas...oh my gah...they were great also. Patrick, for real. They were awesome! So...Patrick wanted me to come so I could meet Dustin Bailey! He's from Section of course...and he's in the band too...and so was this guy named Brandon and Brad Smith (he's from here..the one in my grade) and some Chris guy. They're all cool. But yeah, back to the Dustin deal. I know a lot more than I'll say buuuuuut Dustin was cool. and hot. very hot. and he's TALL!! lol! He's like 6'7''! and I'm 5'3'' so there's a big difference in height but...since when does height matter? :D Monica said she saw Dustin mouth "Friday" to Patrick....I won't assume anything but I hope he meant he wanted to try to see us Friday again! wow, you guys don't know how happy I am! I'll try to keep updates on what happens with that. Brett called me last night and he's not happy about goin to bandcamp AT ALL...which reminds me, I need to start chargin my phone nowso he can get ahold of me on bandcamp break. :D He's supposed to let me know how that's goin. Ok well he called. haha he said it's not TOO bad. He's about to eat...of course I would be eating too if I had bc all day. He crax me up! haha... Nothin goin on with Brad. *he* misses me and wants to come see me soon. Dunno what's happenin there...it's weird.  I'm just happy. All's going well I think. On that note, I'm going to get food.
