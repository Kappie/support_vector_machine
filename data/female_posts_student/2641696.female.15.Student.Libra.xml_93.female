BW isn't that bad either. Iunno what I'd do without my best friends. The trunk is due next next Monday after all. I'm jealous of MO. We're having ham for dinner tonight. Music is the awesomest class ever and I was so stupid to not sign up for it next year. I will miss Mr H! Mr H is my favourite teacher!!! We tied up MG with duct tape!!!
