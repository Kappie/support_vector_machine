I know that eventually, you'll be reading this, so I'd thought I'd write to say how sorry I am for not being more sensitive. Not only that, sorry for being so self-involved. Sorry! When I get all weepy, I get like that.     Anyway, yeah. I cried a lot today. Like, eight times... Hahaha, I think I got heat stroke, and it messed up my brain. Like, I'd be totally fine, then just all of a sudden, crying like a baby. My eyes hurt. Lol! All the things that have been bugging me for the past month just got dregged up.     (Speaking to Lauren)  It was very yucky, and I also would like to take the time to both apologize, and thank Lauren for her valiant efforts on the battlefield that is always between us when I'm spazzing. Sometimes, I think it's better to just tell her that I'm fereaking out right now, and not to take me seriously, than bottle it in and wait until it explodes. Icky Ickers.     Sheena's coming home soon. I miss her, and I miss talking to her.    Frank is chewing a toliet paper roll. And eating it. Yum    (Speaking to Ashley)Oh! Right! I also meant to thank Ashley for her amazing, indepth analyzation of my dream! holy crap! You pulled so much from that, and as I applied it to my life, I started seeing a lot of paralells! Nuts! Thanks so much! That was awesome!
