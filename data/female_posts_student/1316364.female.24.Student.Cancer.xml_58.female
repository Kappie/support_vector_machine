I find that I am reluctant to close my eyes and put my self to rest because I know that I will have to wake in the morning and venture to another slow day at work when I would much rather be home sleeping my morning away.   I had many a trying events this weekend and although there were three separate days it really just felt like one long one. Today we had a Barbeque for Memorial Day. A few members of my family were here and it was so nice to see them all. I think today was the first day I really didn’t think much of Jesse, but that has a lot to do with the fact that I didn‘t really get the opportunity to think about him over all of the screaming  from my niece and nephews and the loud chit chat of a few of my Aunt’s gossiping. This morning I went to a special Mass at the cemetery that my Nana is buried in. It was a very nice service and afterwards we went to pay our respects to my Nana. I also asked my Nanu if it would be alright to take a picture of her plot to send to Jesse through email. He gave me the ok and I took two. Jesse hasn’t seen it yet but I will make it a point to email it to him very soon. I feel it is very important for him to see that we are taking good care of her and maybe when he comes home for leave he can go with me to see her and take her flowers. I told Jesse that I knew he would be ok there in Kuwait because deep down inside I believe that my Nana is now an angle for God and she is watching over him and will make sure no one harms him in any manner.  Today, although very busy, made me remember that I am very thankful for all of the service members past and present and what they did for the U.S. as well as remembering those who stayed behind at home and took care of their families.   Somewhere I read that the toughest job in the military is that of a military spouse. That is always something important to consider.
