I'll be damned if I join a side that wants to take away everything my family has worked for and give it to some fucking useless sack of shit over in the projects because it's not fair that he doesn't have our business. I'll be damned if I'm going to support people who want our country to roll over and take everything the world gives us right up the ass like France.  Fuck that. I have to much pride in myself, my family, my country to support socialist fucktards who want to ruin everything this country stands for. Fuck that. If you have a problem with the fact that I'm a conservative, fuck you too. I'm allowed to have my opinions, and support who I want to support because of the constitution. I'll be damned if I'll let the Democrats take that away from me.    Isn't that lovely?   I fucking hate people like that.   Now I remember why I don't really talk to her much.   *shakes head* I won't even go into all the counter arguments I have on that, but she's right, she can believe what she wants. But fuck if I'm going to listen to it told me like THAT!!!  //death rattle in the distance  ...
