If you look below, you'll see  South Park Mute , and in a couple seconds I will have  South Park Jackie  posted too, I have to say I look wicked cute in my pigtails!   Anyway, here is  South Park Mute  (I have gotten into the habit of calling Ian that now too). Wearing his usual dress shirt and I tried giving him his wild messy hair and his cargo pants.      Now here is what everyone wants to see; It's  South Park Jackie ! Look at me with my gorgious black pig tails and my white tank top (which now has bird shit all over it). I am also wearing my jeans.
