But what happened to the promise you made for love?  In the other side of m mind something whispering I hear saying leave him! I cry myself to sleep everytime I think you leave and the frightened day is here you're gonna leave me,nothing words to hear...  you leave me standing in the rain all alone without somebody to took me home you leave me for another girl who you think is better but believe me she didn't and wouldn't be but if you're sure not to change your mind I'll let you leave me here in the dark  Coz' I know somebody will save me from this pain sorry to the boy who lose the love of mine for the other girl who played six or nine Sorry to say but that feeling called love is in the air above..
