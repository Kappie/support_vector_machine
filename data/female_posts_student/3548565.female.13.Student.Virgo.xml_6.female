I couldn't mix around with people and I get very upset and cry when I see other people coming into my home. I guess it was some kinda of insecurity. It's always been there, planted in me. I didn't know what made me like that, and I still can't understand it all to this very day.   My parents were worried during my first day in kindergarten. They were afraid that I would not stop crying and wanting to go home. I was already 4 then, maybe nearly 5. True, I still had that fear in me when I stepped into my class. There were suddenly so many new faces. It was such a different environment. Miraculously, I survived.   I don't know how but I just changed. I started making friends. True, there were days when I simply refused to go to school, but my mum would always be there to pull me out of bed and force a complete breakfast down my throat then my dad would send me to school. But the problem was that I had stomachaches almost every day. The pain would be so intense sometimes that I just wish I could go home. But I knew I couldn't. Sometimes my stomachaches drive my dad to the edge because he needed to get to work on time and there I was, crying in pain, as precious seconds tick by.   But I have my whole family and all my friends to thank now. I've been through school for a total of 9 years so far. This is my tenth. I went to a girls' primary school for six years and then I moved to a co-ed secondary school when I entered Form 1.  That, I have to admit, was one of the biggest challenges I have ever had to face in my entire life. Almost everyone in the school speaks chinese, and here I am, unable to understand even ONE chinese word! I figured I would just be an outcast during my first few days. Needless to say, my whole first week sucked. It was the most terrible week I have ever gone through. I went home on the verge of tears plus a bad flu on the first day. And the heavy downpour did not help.  I had constant sharp headaches during my first week in high school. There is no way I can ever tell you that my first day in high school was incredible 'cos it just wasn't and I am not about to lie to anyone.  My mum saw that I was unhappy in my new school. She knew that I could not fit in into the environment. But I don't think she knew, even now, that I hated EVERY SECOND I spent in that class then. I kept to myself, for I didn't think that I could befriend anyone there.  Lucky for me, I found my friends. I can't remember how exactly we got to know each other, but I do remember that I offered one of my friends a little chocolate bar and her first word to me was "Thanks.". You couldn't imagine my happiness then. True, we were not exactly friends then, but the bond grew stronger by each day.    I settled comfortably into my class somewhere in the second week. I was starting to have more friends and I could approach someone more easily. I somehow managed to get up and walk through the fog of my sadness. I overcame my fears and faced my challenges. And now I have conquered them.  I missed my friends like crazy when I first moved, but now I realised that somehow it is also a blessing in disguise. I still do keep in contact with my old friends, and believe it or not, we are actually closer now. My best friend now was once someone I barely knew, until I was in Primary 4(fourth grade). I'm now in Form 2 (8th grade) and we're still very close together.   Throughout all these years, I have faced a lot of challenges, I lost some things, I gained more. I admit that I have "lost" a few friends. I never see them any more, but just the memory of us being together once is enough for me.  I have learnt that a true friend would and should stick by you no matter what happens, but you also can't be too dependant on someone else 'cos sometimes you just have to face it yourself. Just try to think positively, even though it's very hard sometimes, but you will have the courage to survive through it.  God made everything happen for a reason, and there is always something good behind it, so no matter what, always try to think on the bright side of things. Appreciate everything and everyone you have now for they might not be here soon. Maybe just a minute later, an hour, a day, a week, a month...who knows?   Learn to forgive and forget and you would lead a happy and colourful life.  --Fluffles--
