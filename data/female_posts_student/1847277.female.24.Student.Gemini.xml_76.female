And, with prelims and everything else that has been going on, I never did put up my Christmas tree!  Maybe that should be a project for tomorrow.  I bet Matt would be surprised (except now he can just read my blog and know that I'm thinking about it).  There's something warm and happy about a tree with pretty lights (okay, I really just like the pretty lights, I think).  Of course, tomorrow I get my linguistics final.  The reason I did fairly well on the midterm was because I spent the entirety of Thurs-Sun working on it.  Guess I should be prepared to do that again if I want to maintain my A- for the final grade.   Dave was harassing me today about harassing him.  He says I am on IM far too often and need to find some more friends.  I should have pointed out that the reason I bother him is because he's online just as much as I am.  Do I like sitting around on the computer all day/night?  Not particularly.  I still have issues with the living alone thing.  It's a different world when you have people around to go out with, watch TV with, just to hang out on the couch and talk to.  I miss that!  I could deal with roommates, for sure, as long as I had my own room/space.    Anywho.  That's more than enough from me for now.  I'm sure I'll have further ramblings tomorrow...
