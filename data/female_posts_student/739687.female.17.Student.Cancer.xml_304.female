No one can beat me. :)  I'm unstoppable, you bastards! :-P  And my life owns all of your lives. Time like a million. Plus five.  Thank you very much.  I've had a splendid day. Just chilling...having a good time home alone, while my family was out TV shopping. I love that alone time. I get to like break the house down with the sound system in the living room. And just be alone and have time to kick back and relax for several hours.  Mmm...fantastic.  Life is  fantastic.   Have a  fantastic  day, crazies!
