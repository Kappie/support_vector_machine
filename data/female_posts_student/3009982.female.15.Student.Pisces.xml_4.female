A loud poof, and all is gone The most desperate hand grip Can only hold for so long Sooner or later the only you can do Is watch yourself failing, falling Down and down and down to the stage below You see your lifeless body sprawled on the ground While all the world gushes shock and oozes sympathy You had the world counting on you With the ability of Clark Kent Your chest puffed up with the fearlessness of evil Is now deflated, representing surrender Your two feet once clinged firmly to the earth But now they lie cold and numc Why? How? You'd never imagine Inviscibility crumbled over the months Strange as it seems, it might indeed just be gone But beyond hope perhaps not I do not know, for these things are beyond anyone's knowledge But one thing possible: A fallen superman can shape a better one
