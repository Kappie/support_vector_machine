They had already developed feelings for each other. It will be nice to see them go dating again because the "first date" they had was extremely funny!!!   After watching episode 9, I have decided to get a pair of shoes with shoelaces. Why? I know if I tell the reason, all of you may think I am crazy. So, I had better not tell why. But, there are two person who knows the reason (my boyfriend and my roommate). If you want to know why, you have got to watch episode 9 of TGUIT.  Again, I have got to wait till this Friday to watch episode 10-12. Seemed like these days, all I can do is wait and wait. Couldn't really concentrate on studying my GRE or doing my research work.    And I plan to watch Spiderman 2 with my boyfriend tomorrow night. I liked the first movie a lot and I thought maybe the second one will be equally good. Let's see how it is...
