I'm 15, live in Kansas and am a student in one of the worse programs ever devised- International Bacceloureate. Its the shit, literally.  Most see me as manipulative, which I don't blame them at all. As a depressing whiner, again, they have fair grounds. And as unintelligent, but to that I take offense.  Life basically revolves around a particular person right now, and I'm very ashamed that it is this way.  I have a few friends that I'm very blessed that they don't hate me yet. I'm not always there for them...but on the outside it doesn't seem to have too much of a traumatic effect.  Who knows?  Chances are they all secretly despise me.  Meh.
