In you, I have found a love so true,   My heart is filled with love for you. Well... Every time I look at you, my heart would skip a beat or two ,   You make my life so whole with glow, you make my life complete with gold.  My love for you grows more with each passing day,   The thought of your gorgeous face takes my breath away: Those brown eyes fill my soul with happiness,   Those luscious lips I love to kiss.  The day when I become your wife,   Will be the happiest day of my life. Even thinking of that day makes me smile,   I can't wait 'till I walk down that aisle.  I dream of that day when we'll both say, "I do"   For always and forever... I will love you.   with love to melvin,                    Fion
