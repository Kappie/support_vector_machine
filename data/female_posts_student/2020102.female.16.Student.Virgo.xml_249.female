I clicked on the link to view my blog, and it went to it, only none of the stuff there was anything I put there, it was all this gross porn stuff that was posted by someone named Cory Truesdale. Then I clicked refresh, and all my stuff was back. So just a warning, if that ever shows up when you click on it, just know that I had nothing to do with it, and clicking refresh usually will fix it for you. I'm really sorry if that has happened to anybody so far! I didn't even realize it.
