I was home alone(or, I thought I was), and I knew we had a box of detergent, so I reached up in the cabinet and...it wasn't there. So I turned to the freshly-purchased warehouse-club bucket of detergent(you know...the size that could keep a laundromat going for a year). I assumed that, since my dad had been doing laundry, surely he had opened the bucket. Apparently not. So, naturally, I tried to pry the lid off. Nothing. And I tried again. Again, nothing. If I didn't know better, I would assume that the good people at Wind Fresh had a little fun with the crazy glue- I'm still baffled as to how exactly that lid was supposed to come off. So, since it was only a plastic lid, I went in the kitchen and got a really big knife. Nothing. So, I went and got some really heavy-duty scissors. The kind that are actually called shears. Again, nothing. So, I sat back and pondered on it for a while, and concluded that maybe I could punch holes through the top with a hammer and nail. So, I found a hammer and a nice, big nail, and I returned to the bucket. I set the nail firmly against the bucket, and I hammered...and hammered...and hammered...and...nothing. I was desperate now. I turned the hammer to the nail-puller side and began beating aggressively on the top of the bucket. When I calmed down a bit, I noticed I had made a small dent. So I kept beating. I'm not sure how long it took, but after a while I had weakened a small part of the lid enough to make two side-by-side nail holes, and then I used the puller to pry them open just a little bit more. Finally, there was a big enough hole that I could turn the bucket on it's side and watch the powder trickle into the cup-slowly, very slowly. So, when my cup was about halfway full, my brother appeared.  "Are you OK?" he asked.  "Yeah, I'm fine. Just needed to do some laundry."  He surveyed the situation, and then, of all the nerve, he asked,  "Why didn't you just open the bucket?"
