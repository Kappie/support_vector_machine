     Yes, I did it, I went camping 4 times this summer ((YAY)).      I went on a camping trip with Chelsea. Well, I don't really consider it camping since there were toliets and a camper, but hey, what can you do? I went Canoeing Yesterday from 1 O'clock to about 4 or 5 o'clock, It was tiering, but fun! Although, I did find out that I, Jamie, Am a very, very, VERY bad canoer ((or however the crap you spell it)) But had fun sucking.     I haven't talked to Jacob for... 3 days. He's supposed to be calling me soon. I Miss him a whole bunch :(. But Man, It's great having a boyfriend... Ya'll should try it.         Well, I'm sleepy and waiting for a phone call, I'll post something more longer next time ((don't make fun of my sentances;) )) Cya'll.
