(good morning in spanish) approximately an hour to  boot camp !! * wacka wacka! * :D  Anyways, i was so pooped last night that as i was smsing TS  faizal , i totally zonked out. i dreamt that daddy gave me money to buy the  ripcurl  slingbag. haha. this morning when i awoke to my lil' sister's rants.. (=X) i was smiling to myself. i checked my wallet. but i only saw a few pathetic pieces of paper in it. * sigh... *
