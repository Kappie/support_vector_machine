Ihave been studying my butt off all this week, so that I can go out this weekend. Why I evenbother, I don't know. I like hanging out with my friends, especially when we go drinking. Idon't think I am anywhere near being an alcoholic. But at thesame time, I am a BIG lush! Once I start, I have to drink until I get drunk. Why, you ask? I feel like that's the whole point in drinking, to get drunk. God knows it's not because it tastes good.I used to hate beer until I met my husband. Beer is all he ever drinks.Besides the occasionalshot here and there. Although, I have been noticing that I am getting a BEER BELLY!!! What the hell! No more beer for me... That's for sure.My favorite is GrayGoose vodka,yumalish! GrayGoose with tonic and a splash of cranberry juice, oh and don't forget thelime. How pathetic, I am sitting in the school library writing about how yummy alcohol is. IMUST be a lush.    A week and a half of school left!Oh God, Ithought thisday would never come. Almost my entire summer, down the drain.... Argggg..... Oh well, I have to make sure that Ido a whole lotfor the next month.    Last night, right before bed, I had a talk with Mike. I felt that it was time, otherwise I would havefound myself uninterested in anything that involved him. Being mad at your spouse is one thing, but being frustrated is totally a different ballgame. When your mad you can argue about it, then makeup. But, when your frustrated, that's what it is, frustrating. I mean I am no angel, but I feel like I have been so patient with him for a while now and I see no changes. He's not doing anything horribly wrong, but at the same time he's not doing anything at all. I don't feel that hetries to have a relationship with me. It feels like we have flat lined in our relationship and have been at a stand still for a while. I told him that a relationship was a working progress. I want him to make a conscious effort to build a relationship with me. I wanthim to have the desire to have a stronger relationship. Seriously though, is that too much to ask for? I know he wants to just come home and relax after a hard day at work. But all night? Hmmmm.... At least give an hour of your time! I'm not asking to go out on dates every other night, or actually go somewhere.But I think the problem is, our relationship is superficial. It almost seems like he's afraid to get into a deep kind of relationship. I felt that we were having progress, but then we came to a halt. I understand that he's just not that kind ofperson, but at leasttry. I don't know how many times I've asked him to be more affectionate,but he always answers with, I'm just not that way. If he asked me, as many times as I asked him, I would at least make a conscious effort and just try!  O.K. I feel better now that I vented! I have to go study now.....>: (
