Shes like, "my little girl needs to sleep" and stuff, and it was just 7. Grrrr. Stupid bitch, if she knew that she was going to move/live by a busy street in a bad neighborhood, then why the hell did she move there anyway dummy. And she doesn't own that so grrrr. w/e Other people live here too, so shes just one little arrogant bitch. okay. Pahaha Anyhooters. Right now, I was just Role-Playing with Ashley. It was hilarious. Oh my. Fin.
