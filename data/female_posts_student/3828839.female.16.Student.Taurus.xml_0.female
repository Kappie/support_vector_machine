Like a couple days ago, my sister announced that she was pregnant again. everyone was like..  uhm.. cool i guess.. it must be a boy!  the thing was that, it wasnt like the right time to have another baby. everyone's busy (esp. my mom taking care of her grandchild and working under my sister). everyone got their own thing going on. well the point is that, karyn went and got an ultrasound recently, and it wasnt that great. the doctor couldnt see the baby. it is positive that karyn's pregnant though. so my sister was really worried (she didnt tell anyone that there were problems, until today. that's when i asked.. i am the only one who knows) so today, we're at the water shop. im still here. karyn contacted her her doctor...   and as her bday present (sarcastically speaking), the doctor said my sister must come in and get her second child aborted. the child that karyn was so excited about. she started maternity shopping! karyn was ready to breakdown, i could see it in her eyes. but i know my sis is a strong person. she held it in, like all her other problems. im very worried for her. i wanted to cry for her, but i couldnt, at least not in front of her. i cant do anything really... all i could do is sympathize, of like not bring it up. i dont know what to do... this must be her worst bday ever.
