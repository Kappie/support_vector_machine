Just lounging around the house, trying to avoid getting out of bed for as long as possible.  Gotta do the laundry today (yay) and run a few errands.  Gonna pick up my check in the city this afternoon and then go to the dentist for a cleaning- getting those teeth so fresh and so clean.  Nothing else exciting going on.  The brother and sister are both home today, so that's a motivating factor to get out of the house.  Been so busy being a working girl that I have nothing else going on right now.  I got sick of my claws and gnawed them all of last night.  Now I have little stubs for nails- but at least it won't cost me $15 every two weeks, that gets pretty old pretty fast.  Just hanging out in my pajamas with the TV on in the background.    I am still kinda sleepy and not really in the mood to do anything today.  Better take advantage of my day off, because it's back to work tomorrow and Friday.  At least I'm getting paid.  Still trying to figure out what to do for Father's Day and all that stuff.  I still have bills to pay, so we'll see...  Anywho, I guess there's nothing else exciting going on right now.  I'll add more later if something good happens- but I doubt I'll be abducted by aliens before dinner.  *me*  P.S.
