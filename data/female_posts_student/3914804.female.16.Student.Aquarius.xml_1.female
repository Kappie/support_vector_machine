Alternating between Neil Diamond, Dean Martin, Doo Wop, Bob Dylan, Elvis, Maroon 5, Scissor Sisters and Daniel Bedingfield at the moment. Cesca says tisa strange habit that I have developed, saying what music (or mucis as Sloth would say...) I am listening to. Well... I am a strange person!! heehee.  Donchya hate it when you write a blog then discover u'v made anerror, whole editing process, ARGH...  Hey Mr Tambourine Man...    ANYWAY. Off 2 Shrewsbury for a week tomorro, having evaded the family holiday, which luckily Mum has accepted as not being a personal insult. Just couldn't take the arguments right now- my brother, believe it or not, has reached new levels of obnoxiousness. I know sibling troubles are present in every family, and the youngest is always a pain when growing up, but I don't think anyone could understand how bad he is unless they tried living with him. Honestly, he's a monster. Excrutiating pain to Miles indeed. For some reason no-one can grasp, he apparently weed on the outside wall yesterday, so now no-one can go outside til it's been hosed down and disinfected. I swear, he's a fricking lunatic, I don't know how that happened, being part of OUR family...  Kentucky Woman...  Well STILL haven't packed, which can't be good, as I am going tomorrow :-0 Even my parents have packed and they're not going til Saturday. Oh dear. But I do so hate 2 pack... Packing is for wonderfully organised, capable and laid back people, such as Caroline. Messy, disorganised, stressy people like myself should never be allowed near a suitcase, or bag of any kind... Perhaps I should be kept in a padded cell!!! Or not... Mite be a tad boring.  Paddocks, I've always thought that was a nice word, but having said which I must go, until l8r- tea calls.
