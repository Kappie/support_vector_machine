It does not matter if he  already has one. I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to complain.  As a man, you can never have too many cordless drills. No one knows why.   Rule #2:  If you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word  “ratchet” or “socket” in it. Men love saying those two words. "Hey  George, can I borrow your ratchet?" "OK. By-the-way, are you through  with my 3/8-inch socket yet?" Again, no one knows why.   Rule #3:  If you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car, a 99-cent  ice scraper, a small bottle of de-icer or something to hang from his  rear view mirror. Men love gifts for their cars. No one knows why.   Rule #4:  Do not buy men socks. Do not buy men ties. And never buy men bathrobes.  Once I was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, he  wouldn't have invented Jockey shorts.   Rule #5:  You can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn  out. If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the  little picture in the corner. Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips,  and flips....   Rule #6:  Do not buy a man any of those fancy liqueurs. If you do, it will sit in  a cupboard for 23 years. Real men drink whiskey or beer.   Rule #7:  Do not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after-shave or  deodorant. I'm told they do not stink - they are earthy.   Rule #8:  Buy men label makers. Almost as good as cordless drills. Within a couple  of weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. "Socks. Shorts.  Cups. Saucers. Door. Lock. Sink." You get the idea. No one knows why.   Rule #9:  Never buy a man anything that says "some assembly required" on the box.  It will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over.   Rule #10:  Good places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, ParrLumber,  Home Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire.(NAPA Auto  Parts and Sear's Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores. It  doesn't matter if he doesn't know what it is. "From NAPA Auto, eh? Must  be something I need. Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane?  Wow! Thanks.")   Rule #11:  Men enjoy danger. That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue.  Get him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. Tell him the  gas line leaks. "Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?"   Rule #12:  Tickets to a Seahawks game are a smart gift. However, he will not  appreciate tickets to "A Retrospective of 19th Century Quilts." Everyone  knows why.   Rule #13:  Men love chainsaws. Never, ever, buy a man you love a chainsaw. If you  don't know why - please refer to Rule #8 and what happens when he gets a  label maker.   Rule #14:  It's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension  ladder. Never buy a real man a stepladder. It must be an extension  ladder. No one knows why.   Rule #15:  Rope. Men love rope. It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at least  the Boy Scouts. Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8" manila  rope. No one knows why.
