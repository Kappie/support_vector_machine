(Who is, by the way, my cousin)          ***          Name:  Daisuko Tokenkura   OKA:  Dais or Dai (pronounced like dice or die)  Gender:  Female  Human Age:  15 years  Demon Age:  300+  Hair Color:  Brown with red bangs  Eye Color:  Brown  Weapons:  A modified staff, fire manipulation, a Smith  Wesson M10, and incantations  Normal Personality:  Frank, calm, logical, and rational ***    Baka: Hmmm... Dais is also going to be blind except for the fact that she can see a color that represents Kurama.          Kurama: She never told me what that color was. Baka, you're the author, why don't you tell me.          Baka: If she hasn't told you then she doesn't want you to know.          Kurama: But you created this whole scenario.          Baka: *eerie singsong voice* I'll never tell.          Kurama: Is it embarrasing or something?          Baka: Not gonna tell.
