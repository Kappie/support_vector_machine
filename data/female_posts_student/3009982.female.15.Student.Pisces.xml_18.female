It is.  I now have every published children’s book by Roald Dahl. Its pretty amazing how he got away with everything you know- all the gruesomeness, goriness, and disgusting characters he came up with- considering you’re writing for children here, mind you. Simply amazing. Like take BFG for example, the details bout the other wicked giants guzzling up kids from around the world. Hmmm..  But seriously, if you take it the wrong way, you could just point and accuse him of polluting innocent lil kids minds. You should read his revolting rhymes.. Cinderella cut of her step-sister’s head!  The thing is, to tell you the truth, the most part of my imagination sorta derived from reading his books. All the twists, plots, witty and yes I have to mention the gruesomeness and crudeness of his characters, they all play a big part of my imagination.   Haha, it’s wonderful.   I wonder if its theologically alright. But I’ve been wondering too much, give my mind a break.  See you, Mary-Ruth
