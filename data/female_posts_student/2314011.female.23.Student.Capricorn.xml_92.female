Editor's  note: the original text has been livened up a bit; look for the comments in parentheses (like this).   Saturday, January 4, 2003   "I have no idea what I want to see, hon, so you're gonna have to take me where I want to go."   First stop was Piccadilly Circus.  It reminded me of Times Square in New York, not that I'd ever been there,  (even though I had in 9th grade)  but the bustle of tourists armed with cameras and natives on their way to somewhere else reminded me of TV's depiction of the nervecenter.  And at the same time, it was unlike anything I'd ever seen in the States.  (except Nebraska [and I honestly haven't been there at all])   The buildings we walked by were older than the Declaration of Independence  (and smelled like it too)  and they let me feel their presence as we passed.  The juxtaposition of such history mashed together with Burger King and Tower Records stores represented London's crazed meshing of the present's frenzied need to rush and the past's patient wisdom.      We made our way through central London with a vague concept of destination, not really bothering to know for sure.  The theater district of Leicester Square required a gawk or two and a picture of the site of the "Two Towers" premiere.  (because we may have forgotten the movie's importance in the two days since we'd seen it for the second time)   "You know that Gillian Anderson girl?  She's in a play right over there,"  (foreshadowing, stay tuned)  Levi said, as though, during his time here, he'd hobnobbed with many such celebrities and now had to be reminded that the rest of us hadn't.    Eventually, we came to Trafalgar Square.     Okay, I know this place is important, but I'll be damned if I can remember why.   Apparently the plaza commemorates a great victory in 1805 of the English over that little French guy Napoleon.   Right, that ol' thing. 	  The pigeons in the square created a perfect British moment, especially when they all took to the late afternoon sky at the same moment.  "We're gonna get shit on."  (perfect character reference)   "Thank you, Grant."  "See that clock through there?" Levi pointed through the traffic, across the street, many blocks away.  "ThatÂs Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament."  "Hi Big Ben," I said, waving.  	    As we strolled along, making our way toward Buckingham Palace, we marveled at the uncharacteristically sunny weather, agreeing that the only thing that would make the day more perfect was if it was Sunday.  (and if Grant wasn't there)   I was still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that I was actually in London.  I'd not ever been off the North American continent before this, for crying out loud.  It was surprising how easily I gave up any sense of control, planning, or organizing each day.  Usually, I have a mentally-outlined schedule of my days.  Even the ones when nothing is happening; I have to plan what to do with the empty time.   But not here.  It was probably because the whole experience was so far beyond any other I'd had up to this point  (or all that E we did the night before);  I was too busy living and enjoying it to think about what came next.  (because if I had any idea, I'd have been pissed)   The frenzied nature of the present quickly faded away, and I let myself fall under this wise, old city's spell.
