Zo came over and then we called on matty and rob. we stayed at their house and called shauna over. then later on josh finally got home...and we did like nothing...and zo and i had to come home. so yeah! then when we got home we took my dog for a walk and stopped at katies [jess was there!!]. yes yes, it was great. after supper we hung out with katie and jess for a bit too and talked about things..haha we had some laughs...      its 9:00 am and no one is on MSN, probably because no one is a loser like me...no one goes on this early. but i have to be up, so im not a total loser. im going to sauble for the weekend..so farewell...have a good weekend, talk to you when im back!! byeeeeebyeeeeeee!      ...chels.!'
