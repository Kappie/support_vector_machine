Any way I'm just back from my weekend away in Callander, it was great to see my family eventhough they are as mad as ever.  I got there on Friday night booked into my B and went in search for food, found a really good fish and chip shop and eat chips while having a wonder round town.  on Saturday while is was still eating my traditional Scottish breakfast my family turned up, mum making comments along the line of god have you only just got up !!! Well it was only 9.30 !! what does she expect !!  as it was raining (typical Scottish weather) we looked round the shops and bought various types of Scottish tablet and fudge.  we ventured along the road to Aberfyle, small village with not very much there apart from tourist shops and lovely senery, to have lunch in a woolen mill.  after that we went for a walk along to a waterfall, which was very nice.   Sunday we all went to a safari park, I actually enjoyed see the elephant, lions, zebra etc.  for tea as the weather was actually very sunny we went for a pic nic and sunbathed and I opened my presents from my family, I got a really nice jewelry box from my mum, a lovely cup from my sis, a photo album from Ryan and a starfish crystal from Chris and chocolates (vummy) from my god mother and a heart shaped necklace from my gran ( necklace bought with the money she gave me anyway )  I also got a lovely handbag with a cat on it from Alex, which will be used often!! and found chocolate in the handbag, that girl knows me well!!   looks like my love life could be picking up!! Although I'm not sure what to do about it!! remember me saying that the other weekend I fell asleep in a drunken haze on a sofa with two guys?!! at a friends house,well one of them(Chris) phoned me on sat to ask if I wanted to go on a date! At the time I said I would think about it, he's actually a nice guy well as guysgo anyway and good looking and he in the RAF so I wouldn't have to see him to much but he's only 20 or 21 years old! Will have to think about it!!
