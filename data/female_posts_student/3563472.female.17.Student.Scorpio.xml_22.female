So, I've been pretty bored since 1:10. I was going to watch Confessions of a Dangerous Mind again, but I didn't.  My current screenname for MSN messenger is "My Love For Steve Buscemi". I do love steve buscemi. he makes me laugh, and he's half of all the movies ever made. Okay, not quite. BUT he is in 80+ movies. That's freaking crazy!   Funk RULES! I am the FUNK GODDESS!!!!   I'm going to see the County Fair Queen Contest tonight. It should be rather amusing. However, Mrs. Loula just asked me if I wanted to go se Antigone at Brucemore. I really want to go, but i already made plans. Plus, I'm broke  Plato was one crazy guy. He probably needed to get laid.
