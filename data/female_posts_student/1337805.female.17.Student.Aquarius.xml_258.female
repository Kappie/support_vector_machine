The water was sooooooooooooo warm though, so worth it, really. Would looooove to drive down there one day and swim...mm..) (And as usual, there isn't a number to represent how my romance and sex life are :D Not like it's any of your business, but I DO love the guy, after all :) He's my perfect teddy bear.) (I need a better job. I want a shopping spree.)
