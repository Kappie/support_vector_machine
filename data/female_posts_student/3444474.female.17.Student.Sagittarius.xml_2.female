Plus, the Mac OS has gotten ten times better than it was when we owned Mac's years ago, it's more stable, and in general, just plain looks better. You also can't get as many viruses on a Mac as you can on a PC.   In conclusion, I am paying less for the Mac and getting more for what I am paying for, so nieh.   More later when I'm not watching TV at the same time. :)
