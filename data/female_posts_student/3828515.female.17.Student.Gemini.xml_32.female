I didn't put as much time and effort into this design as I had hoped I would, and it doesn't look  exactly  as I had envisioned it, but I still think it looks pretty ghetto... in a good way. you should be able to download it  urlLink here  soon. In other news, I mowed the lawn today. It was hot outside. And that is all.     Last song I listened to:   Holdin On  by Saliva.   Last album I listened to:   Back Into Your System .   Last meal I ate:  A Junior Bacon Cheeseburger and fries.   Last movie I watched:   For Your Eyes Only .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I listened to Illinois Loyalty this morning.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I was looking at metal backgrounds on the Internet this evening, and as I came to some that were more rust than metal, I said, "These aren't  metal  backgrounds; these are metal  oxide  backgrounds" :P.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   Holdin On  by Saliva.   Favorite food today:  That Junior Bacon Cheeseburger was pretty good :).   Most interesting thing I did today:  Made my newest web template and graphics.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Saw a photo of a bum with a sign that said "Money for Beer." At least he was being honest :P.
