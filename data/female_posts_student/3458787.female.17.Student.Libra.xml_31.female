And especially when "you know who" is the judge of the fashion parade. HAHAHA I bet they got into trouble. Ok I sound sadistic like I want them to get into trouble or something - pardon me for that!  But whatever it is, it was funny! hahah I never understood why people would want to cross dress (Here I'm talking about people who do it for a living). I mean you have to be proud of who you are and what you are. I mean if your are not gay and just like any other person, why cross dress?  But on the other hand, it weird how society accepts girls dressed in shirt, jeans etc but not boys dressed like girls. There is some sort of biasness here you have to agree. Ahhh.. It's society what do you expect..
