Grandma's over at their house now. Mom and I had to get home by 1, she for the New Year program, me for MT, so that was it. Our first MT runthrough today. Even the coaches and their criticisms can't get R to stand up straight and look confident, so maybe it wasn't my fault that I couldn't change him. Sweater smells like J now that she wore it. I have to practice mucho piano for tomorrow. I don't know what to do with Mar. 3 and the hospital, since T isn't really part of it anymore...life is insane.
