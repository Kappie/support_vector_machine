Today I took the C-Train to Chinook and applied at Old Navy then I took the bus down to Wendy's and applied there cause Chels, Derek, Eric, and Lawrence all work there so I think that would be kind of cool.  On Wednesday night I went to go see Uptown Girls and we got popcorn and later on some ice cream...YUM!  Last night we went to go eat out  *AGIAN*  and I bet you guessed it...Zellers.  Of course there isn't really many options because all my Grandma likes is Zellers and Dairy Queen.  Anyway Jenny Gear finally got voted  *OFF*  Canadian Idol!!  It's about time!!  And MY idol Billy Klippert is still in there!!!  I sure hope he is the idol, although I still love Clay Aiken from American, he will always be damn sexy and irresistable.  LOL.  And well the last Big Brother it was like really cool how Jun got to leave the house to go to the VMA's, like how cool.  I'm kind of disapointed that Jack got voted off though cause I really did like him.  And well I  *CAN'T WAIT*  for the finale of For Love of Money 2 on Monday.  I am like so into that show now and I used to think it was so dumb.  Canadian Idol was also really funny last night, my mother and I were killing ourselves laughing at these people who really could not sing.  It was the best of the worst show and man those are like sooo my total favourites.  Anyways school is coming soon and probably I will have a job soon and well now I have to think about how I am gonna handle everything!
