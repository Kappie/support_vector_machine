Heather and i went out to lunch that friday. That was fun. good to see heather. and we got new library cards! highlight of my day!!! and i checked out the knights book to research that head bashy thing.       and... then... i didnt really do anything that weekend, i dont think? i dont remember. oh, i went to see Troy on sunday. good movie, good movie. Bloom is soooooooooooo hot. *melts* i want him.      and then... hmm.. we started environmental portraits so on tuesday i took pictures of caitlin and Emily and almost got ice cream from the ice cream man and saw emily's saxophone and...some other stuff. found out you cant play the saxophone lying down...or at least emily wont. nor will she put a book on her head. for reasons beyond my comprehension. and after that... i went to go take pictures of the country medows playground equipment. for shadows and reflections redo. that was okay.     and... i developed my shadows and reflections stuff...A- and B. might redo the B one if i have extra time this week. we shall see. and... i develpoed some of the cait and Emily ones for enviornmental portraits. i have a cool cait one and an okay emily one. I developed and awesome one of emily playing the saxophone and i colored the sax and it looks awesome and we practiced mounting so i mounted it and gave it to her. yay. plus some other practice ones i didnt end up using.      and... yesterday i gave her those. and tried to get her to sleep over after sailing but she wounldn't and then i tried not leaving her house until she agreed but then i had to go otherwise i wouldve been late for sailing. i was late, actually. but... not horribly. that was...uh...interesting. she's right... i am like a five-year-old. but am i supposed to act like i dont care when its something i want soooo much? i guess im supposed to act like an adult. but can't i act like a child when i love her like a child? in that unconditional...safety...kind...of way... i dont know what im talking about. but it makes sense to me.      anyway..then i went sailing. that was fun. very fun. cool times. good to talk with lauren and emily cause i havent in a while. theyre cool kids. and...then we went to taste of chicago which is something ive always wanted to do but never have. that was awesome. delicious! food is yummy. i got yelled at for taking peoples pictures though. which was actually very amusing.   and...i dunno.  today i went to get bagels. mmmmmm, bagels. and i called emily. ive called her every day for a week + 1! hehehe. poor mrs. pasch probably rolls her eyes every time she hears me say "hi, can i talk to Emily?" but thats okay. mrs. pasch and i are cool. ha... probably less so now that i keep dropping by. but oh well. i think she liked my photos.   and then i went to target and bought stuff for my awesome party on wednesday! woooo, party.  aaaaaaand... then i took some pictures of heather for photo. weee. and now i think im gonna go start my movie...
