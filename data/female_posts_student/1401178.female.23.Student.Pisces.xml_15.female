Sure, I've known the net and the art of webmaking for years, but on the blog stuff...I'm a newbie. Thank god I found Blogger, a really cool and easy way to make me own blog.  This is my third week on 'vacation'. I've skipped classes for two weeks in a row now. Beginning to feel bored now. I have CNN on now, watching the reports from Iraq. What on now is the reports about the school music in Bagdad which got trashed in the so-called 'jubilation' after the city was freed. There are a few music instrument that got broken. A grand piano with no keys or lid or legs. Breaks me heart sometimes, watching all of this reports. Been thinking what I could do to help. Find one...which is so common. But then again, I don't exactly have the same opinion as others have. Pity.  Why watch CNN? Well, the Cartoon Network on my cable suddenly vanished. So the only reasonable thing to do is to switch to CNN. Just checking the latest development on the post-war Iraq. And...just incase  John Vause  pops up on the screen. Yes...I do have a fixation? A crush? An admiration? Oh whatever, bottom line...I do like  John Vause . There, I've said it. On the internet. On my blog, where people can see. Eeeuch. I feel sick suddenly. Need a dose of Ginger himself, quick. Bad thing is... Dreamcatcher  due in April 29th. Waaaaay tooo long for a dose of Mr. Lewis himself. Guess back to  Band of Brother , for a quick one.  Hmm, that's it for intro I guess. More Ginger fixation on the next posts. Cheers!
