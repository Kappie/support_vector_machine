It's a poem I wrote off of a Smirnoff Vodka ad I pulled from a magazine, see if You can guess which one. Soo here's "The Jesters Court" by moi.. Karen..     The Jester's Court  Do not become carried away in the stumbling moves of this game, the diagonal shots and parading horses, a passion that can move the unmoving.  The Bishop is leaning far to the side watching with redrimmed unholy eyes, the events that occurr between the unclean, unpromised, unaware, and undone.  The taking of the pawns was illegal but no one will complain right now, the severe alteration of state will catch up, but not until the next morning.  The King has gone and turned his back now, the Charming Prince has swept in for the steal, Lady Guinevere has fallen. Checkmate. Pure drink.
