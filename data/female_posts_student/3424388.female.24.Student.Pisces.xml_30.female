The Chinese are very familiar with VW, and it will be interesting to see how that familiarity will play for VW when the company unleashes its luxury Phaeton model into the Chinese market.      [VW is already playing up its designation as the official auto of the 2008 Beijing Olympic games (the 2008 Olympic logo is fabulous, btw). And, interestingly, when you want to translate the  urlLink site's  Chinese characters into English, you click on a British flag. Wonder if any sites ever use American flags to designate English? The site refers to the Phaeton as a "saloon," which is British for a sedan; I had to look that Britism up. The "saloon" is built in an angular, transparent  urlLink German factory  that resembles a Frank Gehry rather than a plant/factory. VW is touting the place as a "mobility infotainment center" and offers the chance for a Phaeton purchaser to watch, in the flesh, his/her car being built/born. Interesting, indeed.]      The fleet of new Chinese car owners have been limited in their brand choice up until now, but that does not mean that the Chinese nuevo riche are not brand savvy (though perhaps not brand nuanced). The Chinese, I'm generalizing here, love logos - big, bold ostentatious logos.  Wouldn't you, if you were a citizen emerging from communism?         Enter VW's luxurious  urlLink Phaeton .    VW has had some rough times lately, with dismal sales in North America in 2003. But the Phaeton, which has done rather poorly in      America      may have a future in China.     [The     $64,600-a-pop     Phaeton V8 was released in the U.S. in November 2003.      The ultra luxurious Phaeton W12 starts at a whopping $94,600.  I can't find a price for Phaeton models available in China.]     First, the Phaeton is not made in China, so it automatically gets a "thumbs up." Second, as branding is a recently new phenomenon in China, it seems that Chinese are not as deeply entrenched in their branding paradigms as are Americans and Europeans. Granted you see several high end fashion houses in Shanghai and Beijing, but it seems that many American and European brands do well in China, even those brands that are not uber-jet-set.  In other words, I'm not sure if pedestrian is such a horrible thing when it comes to cars in China.  If it's a stylish and expensive car, it might not matter that it's a VW.  For example, Buick, of all brands, makes a killing in Shanghai. It's an odd feeling, being in Shanghai, surrounded by Buicks. Yet these are not your grandfather's Buicks. My friend Chris, on seeing a Shanghainese friend's car from a distance, remarked, "That's a nice car. Hey, that's a... a Buick???"  When Americans think   VW, they think functional, trendy, well-engineered cars. Americans will not, at least within the next year, make the leap and associate VW with luxury simply based on the Phaeton, or even the knowledge that Audi is VW's sister company (for what it's worth, Audi will soon roll out a less expensive scaled-down Audi dubbed the A3), though the Toureg may have a future.  But the Chinese may very well start to associate WV with luxury - in some ways, they have been doing so for 20 years.
