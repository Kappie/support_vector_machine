He's making tea - but of course he's making tea. ^_^  Dollface -  darling  ^_~ - is coming over later.  I've been lost in the boonies of small college world recently, so I'm reveling in all the visiting friends.  And Sedg's birthday is coming up, so we get to screw around with him. ^__^  It's all good.
