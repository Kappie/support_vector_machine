(Kiera Knightley is my hero).  I got my friend Collette's YIM address last night in karate, so I can find out what sort or gear I might need. Those armiesse (spelling, anyone?) sticks are awesome. My sliding side kick is much better. I kept crossing over in the recover, like I was trying to do a fourth position. Two  1/2 years of balllet coming back to haunt me.  I really need to learn how to do slap downs. That is, falling properly.  The cool thing about this is that it does have an effect on your self confidence. I figured that was all fitness guru crap at first, but it actually isn't. You become more social, more confident, and you figure out how to analyze situations better. It's awesome.   Bizarre, though.
