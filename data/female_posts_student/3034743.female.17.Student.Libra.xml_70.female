I just read Josh's blog, and reading about the sugar thing made me think of what I once did when I needed to stay awake...haha. Josh knows that story. Today at break I was talking to Marty and I felt like a mother or something because I was scolding him for not going to class. Oh well. It was funny, Marty said hi to Alex and she was all like 'why do you fucking talk to Erica?' She said it jokingly of course, but Marty's reaction was funny. I just realized that Josh and Alex are probably the only ones who read this. Maybe sometimes Holli, but I'm not really sure. Oh well. She probably doesn't. I just think it's Josh and Alex. So you guys are the coolest of all my friends! OK? haha. I don't know. Oh well. Right now I should be doing calc homework, but I really don't feel like going to my locker and getting my book. I'll just take it home tonight and actually do homework I suppose. Wow, what a concept! Crazy! I can't wait until May 14th. That should be fun since we are going to go to Oaks Park for physics class. I might ask Stiffy if she wants to be a chaperone, but I'm not too sure yet. My mom is really cool, so I wouldn't mind. However, I just don't want her to overhear any Matt Belding jokes because that would be bad. And I know some might happen, because they always seem to do. She must not know about that. That reminds me...I am so tempted to tell her that I watched The Exorcist. I really wonder what she would do. Maybe I'll wait a few weeks, but I know that I eventually will tell her. I figure that if I wait a few weeks I can't get in trouble, because obviously I'm fine after seeing it. Oh well. I don't know. I just think it would be funny seeing her reaction. I really wonder what she would do.  Tommy right now is telling me how there are many sides to him, but I think he is full of crap. Oh well. And I just asked him to show me more of his sides and he accused me of just trying to get him in bed. yeah...that is it....sure. Oh well. I've been thinking a lot lately about guy stuff, and it is sometimes confusing. Damn it! Oh well. I just hope that I will get everything sorted out in time. Hopefully that time will be soon because I am getting really impatient. If only there was a way for sure to determine exactly how I feel. I don't even know where to begin, I'm that lost. I want to talk to someone about it, but I am afraid to also. But I need some help or something. I really want to get things figured out. And when things are figured out, I know that I will be much more relaxed and stuff. Oh well. I just really need to figure things out as soon as possible, because if I don't then I am going to drive myself crazy! Hmm....I think that I will be going now, because I really have nothing better to do.  Maybe I'll write some emails to people, or just browse various sites. I could always go to my locker and get my homework, but I'll save that for later. I need more stuff to do after school. Hopefully I'll hear more about that job at the mortgage company for this summer. That would be nice. I could picture myself working in an office environment. I'm good with that kind of stuff. And Amy is really nice, so I would enjoy working with her. With my luck however, it probably wont work out. I just need more things to go my way for once. It would be nice to have that happen every once in awhile.  Oh well, my time eventually will come where everything is going great. Until then, I'll just have to deal with the way things are nice...which isn't too bad. I'm pretty happy overall. There are just a few things that I would like to become improved. Nothing too major tho...so yeah. De nada. (I really have no idea why I just said "you're welcome" in spanish....but I really don't care either.)
