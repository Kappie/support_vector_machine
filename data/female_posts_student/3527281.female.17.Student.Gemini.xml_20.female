I haven't quite figured out how to look up other users yet because I know there are a few people here than I know, and I want to find them! =)   Well let's see... I am 16 years old, turning 17 in 10 days!!! Woohoo... I have one more day of school left, finally!! I have 2 exams to take tomorrow on my last day, Advanced Math and Chemistry, and I'm not too worried about either one.   After school some of my friends and I are going to a state park around here somewhere and we're going to have a picnic and then go hiking around. We always do something after our last day, so it'll be fun!! We might also go swimming at someone's house, but we're not sure about that yet.  On Friday, my friend Wanda and I and my brothers, mom, brothers' friends, etc. are going to see "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," so I am super excited about that.  Mainly, I'm just looking forward to summer!!!!!! Here is a list I comprised....in my head of reasons I am looking forward to summer.   Reasons I Am Looking Forward To Summer:  1: NO MORE SCHOOL!!! 2: No more homework 3: No more dumb english essays for 3 whole months 4: Get away from annoying people 5: Sleeping in! 6: NO MORE ENGLISH!!!!!!!!! 7: Reading what I want, as much as I want, when I want. 8: Going to bed late 9: Getting a tan 10: Swimming everyday if I want to 11: NO MORE ENGLISH!!!!!! 12: Getting away from frustrating friends 13: Vacactions 14: Cedar Point baby!!! 15: Not caring about how I look everyday And last..... 16: NO MORE ENGLISH!!!!!!  Teehee...well that is all I have to say for now!! Catchya later!
