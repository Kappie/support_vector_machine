We smoked some pot and then watched movies all night...it was awesome...but we ended up sleeping (hahah spooning) on the floor cause there wasn't enough room in my loft. So yeah..floors are not all that comfortable.  This morning we watched like all of the movies we watched last night AGAIN cause we didn't pay any attention to them first time...except for me...but I know them all off by heart anyways cause I hate TV so I watch movies!! So yeah...I had an all right time...better than being alone! hahaha...when Marlee's dad picked her up James waited in my room until they left to walk home...it was funny...he is such a pussy...and Marlee is going out with him!! They are overly cutesy...its adorable!!  hmmm...camping with (my) James (there are to many Jameses)...my mom is all 'I want to talk to Ursula to make sure she is okay with this first." and "I think I have a responsibilty" blah, blah, blah...I'll be able to go though...its funny cause I'm not even sure if Bob is coming so calling Ursula is a little ridiculous...I told mom that and she was like, "Well get James' number so I can talk to HIS parents" and I was like...uhhh...I don't even know his parents...meh...I'll figure things out...I still have like 23 days to work things out.  I must go eat...I promised Ma I'd eat with her and Mike (stepdad.)  Chiao
