I'd rather do something interesting, like volunteer at a daycare, or the SPCA... atleast that way I'd be enjoying what I'm doing, right?  I haven't really seen a lot of people either.  The only person I've really seen is Gerardo, not that I'm complaining or anything,.. but there are so many other people that I want to see and hang out with this summer. Oh, I went to the movies last friday with Marci, and DM was there, too.. so it was kool to see him =)..  I haven't hung out with Roxie either.. I saw her yesterday, but it wasn't for that long really.. and we didn't do much... altho, the computer did tell us that we were a man =P... and, I haven't seen Rukhie either... I really wanna see her and hang out with her, cuz I miss her a lot.  I ran into Allie the other day... and Trinity! She's so adorable!  But yeh, I want to get together with her too, cuz I miss her a lot.  And, I've talked to Holly.. she's here now, and I'm glad.. cuz that means that I can see her soon... She'll be there with me next year too, so that's a comforting thought.  But, like the title of this blog says, I am BORED, I've been BORED, and I'll probably remain BORED.. so, please, SAVE ME! Boy, I'm a loser!
