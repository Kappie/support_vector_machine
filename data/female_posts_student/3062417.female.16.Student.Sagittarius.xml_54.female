I hate the way you make me feel like crap constantly. And I hate myself for running to you all the time. I hate how you have the abilitly to control my emotions. I hate the way you treat me and then expect me to still care and I hate that I do still care. I hate that I forgive you for everything you do and I hate how you know I'll forgive you and use that to your advantage. I hate how you constantly contradict yourself, you are a hypocrite. I hate how you lie to me. I feel as if I can't ever trust anything you say ever again. I hate how you blow everything out of proportion and then get mad at me for absolutely nothing. And I hate your hair and your stupid facial hair. And I hate how you lead me on and then kick my feet out from underneath me when I'm actually happy. But I don't hate you. Not the least bit. And sometimes I think I live for how you make me feel.    "So, kill me, just kill me baby, put me through the worst pain immaginable. Just make me feel alive."   (quote by me)  I hope you are happy. I seem to have managed to write a lot about you today without even mentioning your name. Atleast I've finally admited to you how you make me feel. And that makes me feel better.  So, now that I got all that shit out of my mind, on to the other crap. Well, it doesn't look like I'm going to solo fest on saturday. Mr. Ischia just gave my time slot away because apparently I'm "not ready enough". How the hell would he know? I've been working on that fucking solo since July. Bull fucking shit I'm not ready. Well, I guess it doesn't matter much now. My one goal for this year of doing good in solo fest and making All State next year is crushed. Why does everything always get taken away from me? I hate this, when I think it can't get any worse, it does. Pretty soon I'll be left with nothing.  And to make things oh so much better, I didn't get to go to the boy's track meet to watch Kevin and Ked (Ned) which would have been so much fun.   I hate it, I absolutely hate everything. I can't take this shit anymore. As I said to someone today (I think it was Dan B.),  "I'm just one giant ball of depression, don't get to close or I might suck you in with me."   Another quote, I said it to Carol last night,  "But the thing is I can't stop talking to him. I'm like a bug drawn to a bug zapper. I know I'm gonna get killed but I keep flying towards it anyways."  Nice analogy huh?  Right now I'm talking to Molly and listening to Yellowcard.  Song:  i'm just so tired wont you sing me to sleep and fly through my dreams  so i can hitch a ride with you tonight  and get away from this place   have a new name and face    i just aint the same without you in my life   late night drives, all alone in my car i can't help but start singing lines from all our favorite songs and melodies in the air    singin life just aint fair    sometimes i still just can't believe you're gone   and im sure the view from heaven beats the hell out of mine here and if we all believe in heaven, maybe we'll make it through one more year  down here    feel your fire,  when its cold in my heart and things sorta start remindin' me of my last night with you i only need one more day just one more chance to say i wish that i had gone up with you too  and i'm sure the view from heaven  beats the hell out of mine here and if we all believe in heaven maybe we'll make it through one more year  down here    you wont be comin' back and i didn't get to say goodbye  i really wish i got to say goodbye  and im sure the view from heaven  beats the hell out of mine here and if we all believe in heaven  maybe we'll make it through one more year  i hope that all is well in heaven cuz its all shot to hell down here i hope that i find you in heaven cuz i'm so... lost without you down here  you wont be coming back and i didn't get to say goodbye  i really wish i got to say gooooodbye  -View From Heaven- Yellowcard  Wow, what a really long post.
