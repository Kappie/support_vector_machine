So, Toni Lynn, where are you from?  Toni Lynn looked quite amused, hunched before the monitor of a mighty nice gateway computer that she certainly couldn't afford. She typed away on the keys, the answer, while her sister looked over her shoulder hoping against hope that Toni Lynn would discontinue her tippitty-tap and decide to go home from the library.  I'm not from anywhere, really... i've lived in several states, most often, NC, most recently, SC... My roots are in NC, and I have several red-necked relatives on my dad's side of the family who snub their noses at the drunkards, hill-billies, and floozies that lounge on the branches of my mothers end of the family tree. I would have asked Toni more questions, but she finally decided to give in to her sister's unwavering and impatient stare and go home. to be continued... I'm finished for now, Kimmie... stop looking at me like that!
