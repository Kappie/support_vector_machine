So he said he would call, then he lost track of time and decided to go to bed, even though I stayed up just to talk to him, I was looking forward to it, hoping it'd cheer me up. Serisously, this made me feel even worse, it's like he doesn't want to talk to me, we didn't even talk Friday either. I don't think I've done anything wrong...I really needed to talk too, but it doesn't matter anymore, whatever...   Don't leave me in all this pain Come back and bring back my smile Come and take these tears away
