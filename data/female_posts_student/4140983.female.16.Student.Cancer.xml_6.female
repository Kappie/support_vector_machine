They had a little volleyball, and since I can't see without my glasses, I thought they were naked. Ha, there was some lesbianism too. I thought I'd be wearing more clothes than anyone, but I was wearing the skimpiest bikini, save three girls who were incredibly skinny and boobless. And Treola. But I don't care if I'm fat.  I spent the evening with Monica, Jessica, Jenny...I joked that I wanted Monica, and she kept bringing it up, so I started like rubbing up against her and stuff, and we would say it like, really loudly, and people would go "WHAT?" And we would start over. She's like, "Yeah, I love pretending I'm a lesbian, but I'm really not." Which lets me know exactly the kind of attitude that's accepted in Arkansas. Monica says that any happiness she has is a face. I enjoy talking to her, more than she likes talking to me, I'm sure. Because I get so incredibly ditsy. I kept talking about my scrunchie. Who the hell cares about my scrunchie? *I* don't care about my scrunchie. Honestly. I don't know what it is about me and people. I'm either bitchy or so stupid. I don't want to be stupid around Monica, I want to seem intelligent, but I just can't manage it. It's especially hard when you're wearing a hot pink polka dotted bikini...anyway, I don't mind seeming stupid in front of some people, but it's hard when you want the person to respect you. And I KNOW she's not one of those "everyone has redeeming qualities" people.  I had to tape Big Brother...I love Big Brother, I'm not sure why. The people are stupid and annoying, the challenges are dumb, and it's on like every freaking night, but I still enjoy watching it.  Something more intelligent was planned for today, I had a thought that was bothering me all day until the swim party. Then I forgot it. Maybe tomorrow I'll have something better, but for now, tis merely a recording of events.  My nose peeled for the second time. Here's The Nose Chronicles:  Thursday: Nose burns Friday: Nose blisters Saturday: Nose REALLY blisters Sunday: Nose becomes crispy, all skin peels Monday: Nose is about to die, cannot be touched Tuesday: Nose becomes crispy again, peels second time
