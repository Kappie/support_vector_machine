I just made $30.oo by babysitting my cousins, they are so fun! One of them is 5 and the other 2. I can't tell you their names, because it's top secret, confidential, private. I am happy my nice computer, which I named "Vern" is working again. He usually doesn't act up like that, but I guess he was just overused or something, right Vern? Vern says yes, and that he is horribly sorry, and he just asked me to go drink some tea tomorrow at noon. Of course I said yes. Oh Vern, he is such a sweetie pie. Anyway, on the 12th I went to the movies with Olivia and saw "The Village" at the movie theater at a 7:00 show. It was a really good movie, but the only thing bad about it was it was scary at first, but most of the movie wasn't scary at all, you would have to see it to know what I mean. SO GO SEE IT! I was so scared I was holding my jacket over half of my face, so if anything scary happened, I wouldn't have to go and look away, all I had to do was cover up my face. I was too scared to eat my popcorn the whole time because I thought something scary might happen soon, so I had to keep my hands on my jacket. Plus my neck was sweating like mad. I am going to bed early tonight so I can finally wake up early for once, so I can get used to it for... for.... SCHOOL. Curse that  word.  I am excited for school, but only for the first day, after that, all hell brakes loose. I have to go, because my hands are starting to hurt from typing too much too fast. See ya, I'll prolly write more tomorrow. Bye.  -Sierra
