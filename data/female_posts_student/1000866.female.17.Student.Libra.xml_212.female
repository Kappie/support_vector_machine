If I am another waste of everything you hoped for I will let you down If I am only here to watch you as you suffer I will let you down  So you're standing on a ledge It looks like you might fall...  If I am another waste of everything you dreamed of  I will let you down If I am only here to watch you as you suffer I will let you down  The answers we define Are never what we had in mind So we make it up as we go along  You don't talk of dreams I wont mention tomorrow We wont make those promises that we can't keep  I will never leave you I will not let you down I will never leave you I will not let you down.........   Hmmmm, definitely one of my favorite songs ever. My little quote on this webpage has been the same since I made it a long time ago, and that came from this song.
