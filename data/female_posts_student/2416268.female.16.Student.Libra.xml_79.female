Love:  You're sensitive and supportive but often don't get what you give. You could afford to be a little more demanding to ensure your own fulfilment.    Family:  Your natural diplomacy often means you mediate in family arguments but, as in love, you sometimes need to put your own needs first and let others sort their own problems out.    Fashion:  Your wardrobe tends to be understated and you prefer neutral styles in beige, blues and trusty old black and white. Be bold and invest in some stronger colours Â you'd be surprised at the confidence you'll gain.    Finances:  Well done, you're truly the mistress of your budget! You're very cunning at making ends meet, planning ahead and saving for rainy days. You deserve the odd treat though, so don't be afraid to splash out.    Career:  You are an excellent communicator and a natural teacher. Even if these skills don't lead you into teaching itself, a career that allows you to develop others' potential would be most satisfying.    Life goals:  Your altruistic nature often means that you gain most satisfaction through contributing to the happiness of those dearest to you. Invest as much effort in meeting your personal goals and you can't fail.   Now it's my turn.......................   I some me up in one word for all of these parts.... SHITE    My Writing Mood   I suppose its something must of us experience, and I think it has something to do with the fact that we were writing something everyday for 11 years, and now all of a sudden, we no longer have to!!  I need to write........I want to write, and that is not something I ever imagined me saying!! I do not have the ability to write, and yet I feel as though I should try! If I practice enough, maybe I can come close to making some sense!!  I actually quite enjoy writing, as long as its on a subject that intrigues me, I think most people can! What is the point of writing about a subject that bores you, as you will only bore the reader (as you are all bored now)  hmmm maybe that is why I never really write about me on here, as I find that subject really boring, I much prefer to write rambles, as I like to think about things! I cant help its part of my nature, being weird that is!!  Anyways......of the subject of my weirdness, as we all know that it is there!!  I am going to go, and no I dont think I will post again today..lol.... So I am now leaving, my writing mood still intact, and I hav nothing to write about......oh how I wish I had some brains!!
