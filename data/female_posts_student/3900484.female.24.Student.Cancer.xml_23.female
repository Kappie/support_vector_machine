I will work my butt off until I have no butt.  I had to be at school at 8am this morning, people.  Cut me some slack.  I also had no real break until 11am.  Thus, I may be brain-dead within a few weeks.  We'll see.  I am dissappointed to say that there are no real hot boys in any of my classes.  I feel the urge to graduate and prey on the men there.  Surely there will be a selection at a higher level.  Or I could just see what Tattooboy is doing later.
