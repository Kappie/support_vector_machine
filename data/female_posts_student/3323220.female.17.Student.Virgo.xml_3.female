Victor..he..I noe him less than a month only. Yet, he hinted (so obviously) dat he *uh hem* ..er..interested in ...ar..me. I doubt him. I doubt his words. Maybe dat bar of self-defence gate went up. There I was, wif warnings bells ringing in my head. The 1st tot dat came thru my mind is, he is not wat I look for..in a guy. I hope I did not..(and I'm seriously thinking dat Idid not!) ..look down on him.  I dun mind abt ppl's past. Coz like I always like to say and think, wats impt is the present  future. Though he same year as me, he studied til N level..and he cant make it for poly. He didnt wan 2 waste his time repeat his N level..so he opt for NS. When I asked him if he got think abt his future, he said frankly "No!" Hmm..I dun like some of his behaviour. Havent mature yet..maybe guys la..mature slower. He..aiyah..last time I see him quarrel wif our colleagues and all, I got the urge to scold him back. Den when he was transferred to Tan Tock Seng hospital outlet (they need staff there..coz Benjamin, one of Victor's frd, suddenly quit. Juz lidat..abit irresponsible la.) I've seen his frd b4..I try not to judge him too much lor..coz I tink since he cant even answer to our supevisor, how can he be much of a responsible bf? But surprisingly, he quite gd to his gf. Anyway, haha..I go out of track le. So he went to TTS hosp to work awhile..but he will drop by b4 or after work to visit us. Got once ar...how to say..hmm..quite unforgettable la. Dat day both of us had a bad day. I made a serious mistake in my work. I took an order frm customer  I didnt get the cake wif pictures as promised. Den my supervisor helped me made calls to kitchen to settle it. Den Victor came la..on his way to work. Actually I didnt expect him to cum. He didnt say anything. Den b4 my supervisor helped me settle the thing ar..Victor  my supervisor..er..my supervisor scold him lor. For his behaviour at work. Den Victor oso angry..so he answered her back. After dat, he left. But I saw him sitting at the railing by the bus-stop, which is outside our shop. He sat there for quite some time le..so I was wondering..is he waiting for me? I noe he's upset abt the quarrel  probably wanna speak to me. But I havent settle my prob..so I didnt go out of the shop. Instead, I msg him to go work 1st. Anytink we can tok later at nite. These few days..hmm...tonite is the 3rd time I tink, dat we chat on the phone..Den he will always mention abt the gal he likes. I'm a sensitive gal mah..so I suspected long ago dat he likes me. But lately, the hints r getting obvious. It's hard to convince myself dat he's toking abt other gal. Sometimes I was wondering, maybe it's all a dream. I will wake up  find myself daydreaming. Haha..den I will laugh at myself.  There's one thing dat he told me..and I'm quite..er..as in, my impression of him deepened. He said dat if the gal he likes, find another guy who treats her better than him..he will either break up wif the gal..or if the gal breakup wif him, he oso wun br angry. But if the guy dat she left for, is not as gd as him, he will "bu gan xin." Haha..woah! Tonite he said a few things. 1) Ask me go his army swearing-in ceremony 2) He will tell me who the gal he likes, when we go star-gaze one day     He say I will confirm be shocked and will jump ard at the spot     there. 3) After I finished telling him abt the sweet dream I had of willy     (look at my other blog..abt willy de), there was a short awkward     silence. It was den I wondered, "Am I cruel? I knew he *uh hem*     interested in..ar..me..yet I told him such thing..but den..I havent     developed feelings for him mah.." 4) Said I cute..for the 1st time..I nearly wanna vomit. Haha..usually     only I say myself cute...ppl at most say I act cute. But now..he     make me sound like I'm the greatest woman on earth. But aiyah...I     tink he only admire la..not reali like lor..where got so fast de?     Less than 1 month of knowing leh..haha..  Etc..will update in future!
