For our morale project, we need to take some pictures, of us cleaning the class. So it was kinda wierd, 'cause each time we're sweeping, or wiping, or just cleaning the class, we need to just STOP, to pose for pictures. After then continue with our chores again.. Haha.. so fake. But the class was really in a dreadful state, cleaning it was a benefit to all.  Later go Financial Park with Choon Wah, ask Hsei Di and Alvin to join us, too. Sigh, terrible place. Nowhere to loiter, most of the time hanging out at Blueberry. Kinda bored with that place. But no other choice. Labuan is really a small place, every teenager seems to be at Financial Park today. Everywhere we go, we're bound to me 1 or 2 people that we know.  Went to Layang-Layangan to eat satay and chicken wings with teacher Chou and Choon Wah. SO delicious.. ! ^_^ But i hate my tummy, eat little little bit also full already.. then awhile hungry back.. but by then, all the food also gone liao.. :( Go jogging in Botanical Garden, then go drink agian.. Hehe.. and after that, home.  First time get to do such thing, with my lau gong again.. So happy.. :P  At night, Alex's birthday party. Wasn't suppose to have beer, but some of his friends brought some. So stayed inside with Kian Boon, Gilda, Hsei Di, Kian Yung, Alvin Boy and Ah Seng. Think we're the only one that didn't drink beer.. And also play the 'game'. Were u need to kiss an opposite sex as 'punishment' if you lost. Went back at 10:15 pm.
