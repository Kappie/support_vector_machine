It's Sunday, which means that this time tomorrow I'll be at Ball State! :P Right now, I'm packing for workshops, and all you gals will be glad to hear that this year I'm only taking 3 pairs of shoes! (Last year, I had seven separate bags - one being just shoes!)     Workshops are going to be a bit different this year:   Smitty's being out of business entirely, no more buying Mamma Jamma's, ( hopefully ) no Chris or whatever the other guy's name was to stalk Beth and me...     I have come to the conclusion that reminiscing is fun. However, even more fun is eating, and there's food downstairs that'scalling my name. (In other words, I'm hungry! :P) I'll talk to y'all on   Friday!     "Shall we go to bed?"
