I met Spud 2 years ago when I first arrived in Australia and joined the  urlLink Adelaide Swords Club  where I fence. I met Spud through the Internet before I came to Australia and I thought at that time that he was a woman!! Yeap, "Adrian" sounds like a feminie name in France and I never thought that it could be different here!   Anyway, I was lucky to meet him because he is a great guy and I enjoy fencing with him as well as spending time doing everything and nothing. We help each other to teach fencing at the club. He is a very good fencer but also a physicist. Within his work he gets to travel everywhere in the world to help for the installation of radars. He is 39 years old yes, and the latest new is: he will be a daddy soon soon!  We are very happy for him, don't know yet if it is a girl or a boy, but he/she should come into the world in November!! Pictures will then be available!!
