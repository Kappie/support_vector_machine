Hopefully I will see Aida or someone I know there. Last week was really fun, I saw Aida, SIerra, Lauren, Drake (eek!), Kenny, Robby and a few others. It was great. Inever know what to write in this journal. Shit. I hate that. I geuess it's because I already write everything in  urlLink this one.   Okay, well I think I'm done. Adios!      -Kat
