Also, the people (friends) I give this link to will know what goes on in my life. *blinks* I'm writing all this because I was thinking of giving up on my journal - but heck, I'll keep it... why not?  So, lately, I haven't written because I was gone to my best friend's cottage. Her step-brothers are hot. *blinks* And she got to see Mat going out of his shower (yes, without a towel!)  >. .>  Mat is taken (and too old anyways), but not Ben. It's not that I'm in love with Ben - it's just a crush. I asked Isa, and she thinks he's 19 or 20. Only about three years older than I... *grins*  Hm, in other news my older sister feared I might read her livejournal (kalika maxwell, if you hang around), and it just makes me curious enough to go and take a look. But I won't, because it's weird and she wouldn't want me to. Also, I guess it's better for me not to know what she thinks - if she's scared I'll read it, it must be because she says private stuff she wouldn't usually say to me. And oh, she just logged on msn. She's a night creature, sleeps almost all day and when she's up... she writes. About FMA, mostly. FMA yaoi, yuri, gore, angst, armor!Al sex... >.>  (Yes, I had to add that one). I finished drawing that EdxRoy picture I started months ago... I also drew characters from Sublunary... with my mouse, because my scanner still doesn't work. Anyway, I'll post all that stuff later.  Quicktime also won't work for me to view FMA episodes. Develops my angst. Oh yes, I'm more than a bit frustrated. I also have to call the stables tomorrow to know if they need me Monday for the horseback riding camp (no, they haven't told me yet and when I called nobody answered)... *grumbles*  Ricky is sweet. He lives in NB, and I'm going there at the end of the month to visit my grandma and go to our family reunion... and he wanted to meet me. *shrugs* We're both shy, so I have no clue how it will turn out. But like I said, I like Ricky. *nodnod*  And now, I shall lurk.
