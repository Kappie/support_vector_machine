I kind of like when I don't sleep because I get all giddy and it takes very little to make me crack up. ...But also I get kind of depressed, but that's just from lack of sleep...   I got a five-hour nap not long after I got home today. It was great.  I woke up when one of my aunt's came over to give me my birthday present--a super-cute little crystal cat. It is so cute; I love it! :D  I'm tired. I need to go to bed at a decent time tonight.  ...But we all know what I need to do and what I actually do are usually two completely different things. :/   ...I like the Dead Prez. They make rap cool.... :)
