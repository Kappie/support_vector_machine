That seems obvious, but I never really realised that there were so many songs dedicated to that one subject alone.  I mean, you have the "why don't you love me" tune or the classic "i can't live without your lovin'" ballad. After awhile it gets pretty old. So here's my top 5 list of the worst love songs ever. They might be break up songs, they might be make-up songs. But they have one thing in common, THEY SUCK!  5. "Achy Breaky Heart" - Billy Ray Cyrus The worst thing about this song is the Title itself. "Achy" seems like a word a 5 year old came up with, but even a 5 year old wouldn't want to listen to this song.  4. "Baby One More Time"- Britney Spears This song is so bad b/c it's so catchy. It's one of those songs that gets permantely stuck in your head. You find yourself singing it in the shower, or humming it at the grocery store. It's also one of those songs that you can't help listening to when no one is around (guilty pleasure song).   3. "Tearin' Up My Heart"- Nsync Song from a boy band. Need I say more.  2.  "My Heart Will Go On"- Celine Dion I have to admit, I actually liked this song at first. But it was played way to much. Talk about overkill. After awhile, Celine's voice gets annoying, and you find yourself gouging your eyes out with a spoon.  1.  "Take My Breath Away"- Jessica Simpson Talk about ruining a classic song. This song used to be great when it was done by Berlin, now it just sucks. Jessica sounds like she has a cold, yet the listener is the one who gets sick to the stomach.  Well there you have it, my top 5 list of the worst love songs ever. There are loads of other songs that could have been on the list, but I'm still trying to block them out.  Chow for now
