(we even allow take-backs. the moving back of a piece if we're very unsure about the move. in the real land of chess you can't touch a piece without moving it and once you move it that's it, buster.)    but it's a game i've always wanted to know how to play. and now i do. thanks to my dad. that's where you'll find me now.
