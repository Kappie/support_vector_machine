(ha! ha! ha!) i had a chat with mum and she says it would be fine if, come next march, i still want to go to tech after fifth year. so i can actually leave the halls of RSD to become a distant memory...yay! and then i want to take a year out to do youthwork, then do a combined practical youth work and theology course at uni. i'm really excited, as i think this is what god has called me to do and i actually want to do it too, which is always a bonus... *grins* i feel much better now anyway, in short. isn't that nice? i know i'll have to work hard to get all the crap exams done that are coming up, but bring it on as far as i'm concerned. because i'm really looking forward to what's waiting for me beyond the splurge of academia. (wow - coolest phrase ever! the "splurge of academia"...)  yeah. yayness! :-D
