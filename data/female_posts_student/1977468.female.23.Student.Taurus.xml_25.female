A few times they went off on these 5 minute long buildup/bridge/multiple solo/jamming sessions that were cooler then the song themselves. The crowd smelled horrible... it was nasty, we came out cover in sweat... none it it was ours.    I'm still waiting for my telecaster to be finished... I emailed the guy who's building it (Tom Cassell in california) and from what he said it should be almost done by now. I'm pretty stoked. I emptied my bank account as well, much of it on pedals. I had to send my amp in for a warrenty repair in San Fransico, I hope it gets back soon.    I'm getting a full time job, to pay for the rent my Dad's gunna charge me now. So there's a good chance I might move out in august as well, which should be interesting...    Uh what else... oh yeah, I need to go hiking. I need to escape for a day. So I will, perhaps next week. Today Lauren is going to show me some of her Camera-ing tips. In return she wants some of my mad guitar skill... thought I must admit, as great of a teacher as I am I'm not sure if I can pass skills of such maddness on so easily. Since my band can't play for her party thing this wedsday im just gunna to an acoustic set thing... all alone. Which means I have to write some more acoustic songs, listener friendly ones. Cool.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.  "Rain coursed over all surfaces of the city in a seemingly relentless torrent of downward force, driving the souls and spirits of each pedestrian to the lowest manner of their being. Still they pressed through, seen only as phantasmic blurs of shady perpetual motion, gliding to and forth across an atmosphere thicker then one of oil and canvas." - Prospect
