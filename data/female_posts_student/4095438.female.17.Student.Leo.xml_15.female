This year I've kinda been obsessed with my body and my image, which I can't say is a healthy thing.  But I know I'm going to be bitterly disappointed if I go home in the same bad shape, in the "overweight" BMI category. To give you an idea of how bad it is, I've lost 20 pounds (that's roughly 9 kilograms) since the start of the year and I'm STILL overweight.   Readers that know me, will remember back to year 12 (it was only 2003 - surely your memory isn't that bad :P) and know that I'm a completely lazy procrastinator; I put everything off until the very last minute.   Apologies to Alex, who has just read some of this rambling self-analysis in an email, but here goes... it seems that I would unconsciously prefer to work twice as hard say, overnight, than I would to work at normal pace over a week. I did it all through year 12 and actually, that worked out bloody well for me, so you never know :P   So, I have roughly 36 days until Fiji. 36 days = 7 weeks, 1 day. This gives me more than enough time to complete the  urlLink Slim in 6  program, which I KNOW gives me results, because the first 3 weeks I did it back in February, I lost 15 pounds (approx. 3 kg) and I've more than kept it off since.  The official goal is to lose 2 pounds a week, which means I'll be 14 pounds lighter by Fiji. But the unofficial goal is to lose twice that: 28 pounds over 7 weeks. To aid my plan, I'll be keeping an online weight loss blog - the link to follow.   Wish me luck.
