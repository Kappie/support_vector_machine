In fact, my professors taught me how to think, inquisitively and logically.  The discipline taught me how to articulate questions and how to go about answering them.  "So, where are you running off to dig up bones?"    A background in anthropology led to a solid marketing (interlude) career for me, complete with a nice paycheck.  The business stats course I took was a breeze... but I got sick of marketing - sick of selling the services of lawyers.      But, I have to admit, as an anthro undergrad I felt a bit lost.  Academically, I believed there were two questions I needed to answer in order to go on as a student of anthropology, and I did not light upon the answer to either until a few years later.  First off, I didn't know what genre of anthropologist I wanted to be; I didn't know whom or what I wanted to study.  The other question was related to my obsession with usefulness.  What purpose would I be serving as an anthropologist, an outside observer who snooped and then snitched on her subjects?  I desperately needed to have a purpose, one that made sense for me as much as it made sense for the world at large.  In addition to my ethical concerns particular to the field (Chagnon, What did you do?), I had concerns about the long-term viability of anthropology.  The more ethnographies I read, the tighter the knot in my stomach clinched.           The answer to my concerns came by way of a one-word answer:  technology.  Perhaps I'm a late bloomer, as I'm just now awe-struck with my ponderings concerning transcendence of cultures across virtual boundaries.  Or perhaps I'm too early, for when I eagerly expound upon the wonders of the nascent, marvelous internet, colleagues arch eyebrows, dismissing me as another technological determinist, surely poised to lose my shirt on the latest Silicon Valley IPO.    I have but one nagging worry - Will not many anthropologists be forced to become historians quite soon?  And am I not guilty of contributing to this culture-opoly.
