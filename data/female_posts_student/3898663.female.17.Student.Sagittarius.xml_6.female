I shall tell you, I did go and get milk, which made my day a little better. It took me awhile to actually tell myself I did want to get dressed, go to town and get milk, but I eventually did it. I got home and had to get ready for work...I hate work. It requires pretending you care for far too long. But yea, I fould out my friend's parents are having a garage sale...and so I'm going to go and buy all my things back, that I left at her house, because they are selling all her things...since she was emancipated last week. Great fun. After I got off work, I went home, changed out of my work clothes and got dressed to go to a movie with my Mathew. King Arthur, great movie, I enjoyed it greatly. Then I came home and read my book until I fell asleep....Then the strangest thing happened this morning...I was waking up every hour and 10 minutes...It was quite bizarre.   I have decided not to go to school today, I seriously don't feel like taking a shower and getting ready to go, so I'm not going to, besides its hot out there and it's cool in my house, so I think I will stay here, finish my class and wait until the family returns home.    I might write later, depending on how I feel.  Ciao~
