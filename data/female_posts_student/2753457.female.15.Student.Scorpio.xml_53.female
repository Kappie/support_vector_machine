This is how I spend the days of summer. So what did I do this week?  Well, TAP ended this weekend.  I immediately became extremely bored and lonely, needless to say.  When I got home on Sunday night after strike, I was really almost desperate to find something to distract me.  I talked to Chip on the phone for a while, which helped.  But I definitely spent a good bit of this week moping.  I shouldn't do that; pouting is dumb and unnecessary.  I should've seen this coming.  Well, I'm getting over it.  I mean, I've got to; there's no other solution.  I was talking to Ellen about it and she said something that comforted me a lot.  "It's great that you had fun.  And at least you know that you enjoyed yourself enough to be sorry once ended."  I think I'll stop talking about this now.  Probably shouldn't have mentioned it. Saw Fahrenheit 9/11.  Oh, man.  If you are on the fence about your opinion of the Bush administration, please see this movie.  If you care enough to read my blog and listen to me ramble like this, take the time to listen to Moore.  That's all I have to say about that. And I saw Spider-Man 2.  Twice in three days.  I'd say I liked it.  I admire a movie that isn't afraid to make fun of itself.  I like the comic book feel.  And if nothing else, it does have Tobey Maguire.  I kind of wish I had waited a little longer before seeing it again, but I could not pass up the opportunity to leave the house.  I am really interested to see which movies are at the top of the box office by tomorrow.  Maybe Fahrenheit 9/11 is still close to the top. I got three pairs of shoes and a shirt from urbanoutfitters.com.  I was really surprised at how fast they were shipped here.  I ordered them Tuesday and they arrived yesterday.  Usually it takes like five or six days.  Sometimes I wish there was an Urban Outfitters around here.  I really need to get a new dress for the wedding next weekend.  We went to Uniquities on Monday, but I really saw nothing that I would want to wear.  I'll probably just go to Express.  Too bad the one at Crabtree is closed. Now I think I'll go listen to Death Cab and find something to read for a while.
