At Madison's house I learned to skateboard, and so did she. She got a new fan for her room so its actually cool and not burning hott! I came home today, got a new swim suit, a new shirt, and some new school shoes. I also when to the farmers market with my mom and got some fruites and veggies. I came home and Candace and Jake came over, we skateboarded and waited for Madison and stuff. Then we went swimming, this is were the fun started. Hahaha. We swam and stuff, and then it started getting darker, and out of the blue Madison brings up how everyone should make out with Jake, well, funny thing is, we all did. Heh, Candass was first, then me, then Madison. I didn't mind it, it's just.. well I kinda have Patrick S. I mean, me and him aren't going out, but we kissed and he likes me, I like him.. I think we are kinda something, but I'm not sure! Anyway, after that Madison, Candace, and I got pizza, ate it all.. we were way beyond hungry.     So to break this down, sweet and short, I had a kick ass couple of days. I'll chat ya up later!
