Alone in the in the day.  Alone in the night.  ur are not so important as to have nothing left for me,  I know there are many minutes u could spare, if u so chose.  but i am alone.  Not by my choice, but by urs.   I ask not for power and dominance, I ask for equality.  (and u won't give me ten minutes of talk.)  Maybe by not asking for it all, i am committing myself to nothing, but i can't concern myself w/ur side anymore.  now is ur time to stand up and make a choice.  u r a man, not a boy.  u can do most anything that would please u. now u must decide which satisfies ur needs more.  me in ur life or me gone for ever.  no in betweens, no partimes, no maybes.
