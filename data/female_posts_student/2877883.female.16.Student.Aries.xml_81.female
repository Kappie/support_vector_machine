I had my last French class in room 9 ever today.  It made me really sad, there has been a lot of good times there.  OK, so far my math class is me, Jenna, Lauren, Travis, Paige and that's about all I can think of.  We best get there early on the first day of school because I am not sitting next to Greg.  Oh yeah, Greg is in our class.  Quelle Joie.
