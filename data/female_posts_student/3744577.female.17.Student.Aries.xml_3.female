I hate boys right now. Well, at least the boys in my life and maybe not Ross because all the issues I have with him are internalized and he has no idea he is hurting me.     The other night I had a few of my friends over because my mother was away. It was suppose to be Kristen, Ross and me drinking and having a good time together. The problem occured when we started to talk to Brad online and then he thought that he should come over and spend the night with us. This srewed everything up because the girl to guy ratio was even. So we immediatly were paired up into couples because were already pretty drunk and Ross was consoling Kristen because she was pissed off about her recent break-up. That left Brad and me. I was very drunk and when I'm drunk I'm horney so I was very horney and wanted some and I had this tall piece of man meat that slowly getting very drunk. So Brad and I were doing out thing, and then all four of us were in my bed doing things and slowly killing friendships (not really).      The problem with the whole night is that no one got off. I was very upset. The reason I didn't get off was because I had Ross on my mind the entire time I with Brad and I couldn't stand the fact that my friends were seeing me do certain things with a guy that none of us even like. I mean we despise this boy.     Today I was talking to the outcast and he told me that  the reason that he didn't get off was because he really wanted to be with Kristen. What a stupid FUCK? Kristen actually hates him and he still goes after her like a stupid fool. The worse thing is that he is saying this to me trying not to hurt my feelings because I gave hime the time of day in the first place. I never knew a guy that was that stupid in my life. You never tell your potential botty call anything like that. He is such a dumb FUCK!    Guys, I really hate you guys right now!  Where are all the good guys? I need a guy that can respect me for who I am.  I don't even want to think about what is going on with Ross and Kristen. The thought of it makes me sick and I need someone in my life before I can even think about handling that one.
