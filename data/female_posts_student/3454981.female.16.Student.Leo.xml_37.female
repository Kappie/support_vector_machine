Disregarding the whole "prospects of marriage" theme in the book, I feel that there is an important piece that cannot be ignored. It already deals with the word right in the title:  prejudice   I am almost 100% sure that everyone else must have already figured this out way back when they were 7 years old or something, but I feel like I have never quite understood it until this past year. People probably base 75-85% of their thoughts of people on daily observations or little meaningless/worthless bits conversation. People are prejudiced against (about) others for absolutely no right. No one knows what goes on in the other's head. For example, for the past two years most people at my school think I am very prideful and haughty and such a "know-it-all" just because I am shy and my brain retains information differently (well, strangely is more like it--but that's another story for another day) than most people, or anyone they know for that matter. I mean I am extremely shy--I can't even talk on the phone with people because I don't know--I just can't. But anyway...just because I am shy and maybe have just a bit above average intelligence doesn't make me any less nice of a person, or any less of a person at all.  So this is my confused writing of the day...decipher what you can; guess at what you cannot understand.  Comment if you please. I am curious to know what anyone else thinks.
