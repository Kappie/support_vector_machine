I'd enjoy it more if I didn't have a book comeing up after it that I KNOW is going to be way better. It's just that I like the writer way more. It's a Terry Goodkind, part of the Sword of Truth series. I'm sure I'll have really bizarre dreams, but heck it'll be a good read.   Speaking of dreams. I should start recording them here. I have loads of fun dreams. My latest dream involved me being pregnant. Even though I'm a virgin... Maybe an overshare but more often then not I dwell on this fact... Let's not go there...   Anyways in this dream I took a lot of transit, ran through the woods from my hose to the mall, (there are no woods between my house and the mall.) and then caught a train... literally I had to like run a jump on. Now I was only pregnant for like a brief moment, I'm talking like dream seconds but it was wierd. ANyways I don't know where I went on the train but it involved a corner store near to my parents old bussiness revinue. and a bunch of other wierd shit... My Bethie people are harmonizing!   I can't remember the rest of the dream but it is bizzarre any how. OH there was a really big tube comeing out of a whole in my houses wall that an old biddy I know in real life is watching over like a hawk as she bitches at her dog and the dog tries to attack me and my grandmother.   I may be wierd but I'm very creative so bite me. I really want to do some editing on the story my Bethie and I are writing but I'm not at home at the moment so that may be difficult. Ahhh miny beth is being mean about her grandfather's cooking. That's not very nice!   I'm horrid the two of them are doing dishes at the moment and I'm typing up a post. Oh that's amusing but not very good when it comes to being a gracious guest. WOW it's like 9:15 and my parents haven't even called yet! I should work on that. I haven't seen an adult since like 3 o'clock.   I did spend my after supper time channel surfing and watching really racy, bad, music videos... Music videos accomplishes the bad all on its own doesn't it? There were other things on too, but we didn't spend nearly as much time watching them. My Bethie got her T.V. guides mixed up. Silly Bethie.   I really should go now, actually talk to people   TOODLES!
