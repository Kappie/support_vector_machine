I was pleased when we got there that I still was a Junior becuase I'm 16, I was suprised that they didn't ask me for any ID, lol. We had alot of fun, spent most of the time in the outdoor pool because it was a nice hot day for once. Suprisingly I wasn't as self concious as I thought I would be, previously I conned my way out of going swimming with them last time I was asked, but it wasnt as bad as I thought it would be. We had alot of fun and it was some good excersise, the best conbination. We are thinking of going on a regular basis now because it was so fun.  Afterwards we ended up going over to Sayas and we watched one of her Japanese DVDs called 'Spirited Away' as with all japanese cartoon films, it was a bit odd but what do you expect. One of my favorites is called 'Kiki's Devlivery Service' and another one Kyra particullary likes is called 'My Neighboor Totoro'. Of course I can't under stand Japanese (only a few phrases Saya taught me), so we always watch with sub-titles. Saya doesn't even understand most of it as she has forgten how to speak most japanese. After that me and Kyra headed home and I didn't do too much after that. Bye for now.
