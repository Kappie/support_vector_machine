Pamela, actually owns like 356 DVD's.  It's amazing.  We were talking about netflix.  She is canceling her membership.  I should too, but I really like foreign and Strange films and I am sure Movie Gallery is not going to have all the movies I really dig.  So I will keep my membership open in Netflix.  Speaking of movies, I watched Ella Enchanted today.  My mom had free tickets to the movies.  It was really cute.  I really like the Bollywood influence of it.  It had the guy from the Guru and the Indian girl from Bend it Like Beckham.  That's not the influence.  The costume design and the musical numbers is what had the Bollywood influence.  It was so colorful and fun.    I have had the worst headache all today.  I hope it goes away soon.  I was supposed to go out to Kelly's (the country music dance club that is closing down next week) tonight but I just couldn't get the energy to get ready.  Beau, my friend, is leaving on Sunday and I should have just sucked it up and gone with him since I wont see him until next January.  He is going to work in Disneyland, the one in Florida.  I wonder if he's going to dress up as a character?
