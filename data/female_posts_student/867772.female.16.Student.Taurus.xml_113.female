Actually, it's been over and done with for more than a month now, but being the procrastinator I am, I can't write about anyting until it's a month overdue.   I wanted to look back on who I was before I started the school year, to see how much I've changed...and if you can think of a better way than this, by all means, comment your ass off.  Just hindsight on how stupid I really "was" *cough*...  (names have been changed to protect the innocent)    5/7/02  "OMG. Okay. Kathy read my entry from last night, and she says she'll help me change. That's kewl. The only thing is, I donno if everything I wrote last night is what I really want, or complete bullshit? I know I'm bored of myself, but I know I don't want to 'fit in'. I want to be my own person, not somebody else. Do I need to say any thing else? Okay°°" , yes, I decorated my writing with degrees,  "Boy time. James likes me. This isn't good. He's Kathy's ex, and I personally, this might just be me, I think he's just saying he likes me to get Kathy jealous, cuz we're such good friends, AND she's going out with his best friend Dick now. IF (big if...) he actually does like me, then I'm also screwed. I don't want to be any less than good friends with James, but I don't want to be any more either. Of course, I've gotten myself into the kinda shit I hate. You know the shit. The 'soap opera' shit...."   Oh, but you haven't seen anything yet...    6/9/02  "...My picky list: WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A GUY... -hes like a best friend, but we can be more than friends -he's very, unconditionally nice to everyone -very forgiving -loving/caring -smart/ 'deep' (like....I can get into big discussions with him) -completely completely honest -we can joke around and we both know when we're joking around with each other -but we can still not joke around sometimes -romantic but not lame -has a great sense of humor and loves to play around but also knows when to be serious -can admit when he does something wrong -isn't afraid to tell me when I do something wrong -doesn't let his ego get in the way of his thinking -can open up to me -will listen and talk to me when I open up to him -can practically read my mind -into the same things as me -can sing or dance or maybe even both -is perverted -confident but definetly not or concieted or self-centered -witty but not cocky -i can trust him with my life and he trusts me with his -WONT try too hard to impress me -doesn't lose his temper -gives good advice -likes grapefruit juice -respects my descisions -cares about me as much as i care about him  I'm a little bit picky, but only a little."   To top it off, my all-time favorite...    5/18/02  "...I want someone to love me. Not like my parents, because they have to. I want someone to want to love me. Can you imagine how that could make you feel? To know that by your mere existance, someone is happy? That you could make someone feel better by just being you, because they love you? You would feel so important and responsible. So loved. The word 'love' is tossed around so much, I don't think people understand just how powerful and precious it is.  Love, Mel  P.S. Spiderman is an awesome movie!"
