So yea, much to everyone's disbelief, I am still dating Junior and I'm happy about it, now anyways. A couple of things were..settled last night and were okay. I am supposed to see him tonight and I more than likely will because I'm over there with his brother, one of my good friends, all the time. Literally, I think I've gone maybe two days without seeing him this summer. Sad I know but hey, is there anything else to do in Bloomington, Illinois?
