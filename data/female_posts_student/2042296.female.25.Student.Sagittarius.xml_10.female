For, as with us and our time, these flames are solely born through the complete and utterly consumption of its surroundings. By which, the fire itself is also condemned to be destroyed. Demanding, beautiful and very lethal, it lives itself to death...'   The higher I am reaching - the closer to the sun  The more I learn the less I know for sure  For each machine I'm leaving I find a bigger one  For each step I turn wiser than before  But it's burning me...  Pilgrim, where are you going?  Pilgrim, your roads turning bleak  Pilgrim, true to your knowing  But what will you pay for the Grail that you seek?   Though these roads seem endless  And life seems out of reach  The roads I left were better off unwalked  If I had just been stronger  If I had dared to see  Maybe I would not have had to go this far  But still I won't give in...   Pilgrim, where are you going?  Pilgrim, your roads turning bleak  Pilgrim, This quest is your calling  ...the curtains are falling...  Pilgrim, where are you going?  And who sets the price on the answers you seek?    Today I'm once again the pilgrim who desires to go on, to leave the past behind, to seek for something new and to start again. People say, that's the easy way to live life without taking any responsibility but they just don't know. It's not easy, it's far from easy. You carry the same problems with you that other people can store in their homes, wherever they live. You meet new people, people you can't trust because you don't know them. You live in places you can't trust and which are not your home, you can't let your stuff, the clothes, the cd's, the books whatsoever find their places because you know that you soon have to go again. You grow sick and tired of speaking the foreign language, you get really TIRED of opening your mouth and of trying to find the right words or another way to tell what you want to say, when the words are missing. You get sick and tired of finding the convenient food stuff from the stores... I sometimes want to become simply mute and leave other people guessing what I wanted to say after all. If they even bother. See, the problem with this thing is that, when you don't stay long in one place, you don't make close friends that easily. So basicly the people usually don't give a shit what you're doing or saying. And that's one thing that has kept me going, too. I love being anonymous. But you get very lonely, too. For the very same reason.  Here in Switzerland I'm very lucky. I have my boyfriend, who doesn't let me get mute, if I can't say something immediately using the right words. I have something to hold on and that's very scary, too. I'm living in his apartment at the moment, but it's not my home. Actually, I don't have a home at all. I've rented my flat in Finland till 31.5.04. Ohjeeeee... Rico and I are the kind of people who need their own time, who need to be alone. He more than me. Therefore I'm afraid that if I stay too long here, somethign breaks and can't be mended any more. And I'm afraid that I fall too dearly in love with him and suffer my guts out, if we break up. I don't really wanna think about that but then again I can't help it, these thoughts just enter my mind from time to time. I'm also afraid that I hold on too much to him and that he starts feeling himself cornered and that I end up feeling so, too. Then again, everything's going well at the moment, I'm so happy that I've met him and can be with him, and I hope he feels the same way, too. We share same interests, have a lot to talk about in the linguistic frames given (and german keeps on getting more and more versatile!) and the sex is great. And we both love good food and drinks;)  It's a baffling situation. By going away from Finland I'm searching for happiness that suits me and my lifestyle. I don't want to go away for the rest of my life, since I dream of a family and la vie bourgeoise;) I'm the kind of person who gets restless if not given the opportunity to get away from time to time. It doesn't have to be a trip around the world. Going to Zurich or Luzern or so is enough.   I don't think my mother ever could think of her daughter becoming a "pilgrim" like me... My brother is married and has settled down, has 3 children and a beautiful house in Finland. And he's only 8 years older than I. Oh well, I know I'm gonna get alright. I'm intelligent, social and courageous. This is my lifestyle and despite all the cons I'm happy living my life. Man, I'm so RICH although I don't have much money.  So finally my journey ends  And through this wound my soul can mend  Guilt is my blood  I'm being drained  This is my home, I will stay...  ...inside!  There's always someone inside  Fighting to get outside  The "knowing-right-from-wrong side"  Our home is inside!   I've travelled the world around  In search for some Grail of mine  How could I be so blind?  It was always here:inside  I have only some weeks to give  But at last... I live  [D. Gildenlow]  Life's just a line of situations  A matter of occasions  And mystic correlations  The work of a Machine!  [D.Gildenlow/Hallgren] [Hallgren]  Here in a world split to nations  We fail to see the relations  Between the Wheel and the Machine  And of the scars we're leaving...  ...inside!  I swear there's someone inside  Fighting to get outside  Just give it all an hour  By the Concrete Lake!  [D.Gildenlow/Hallgren]  Take care and love your life and the people in it! I already feel better.  --------------  The time is completely wrong. The time here in Switzerland is 2:34 pm at the moment.
