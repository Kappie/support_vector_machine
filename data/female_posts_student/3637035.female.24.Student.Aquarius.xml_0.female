Our stupid town council obviously doesn't know what Mardi Gras celebrations are, because Mardi Gras has absolutely nothing to do with Canada Day. So, anyway, its a parade that symbolizes Mardi Gras celebrations down in the states. So, whatever. Usually this is how it happens each year. Friday night-Mardi Gras parade, beer tents, streets blocked off, big party downtown. Saturday-Carnival, stuff for the kids/family, fun, games, activities, etc... Nighttime, more beer tents, live bands, street dance, whatever... Sunday-Repeat of Saturday daytime activities. So, cool. Well, I guess after the parade (and we had a wonderful time at the parade) A bunch of black guys went downtown and decided they wanted to start up some shit. One thing led to another, people got hurt, someone got stabbed, and just all hell broke loose. So, they went and cancelled the Street Dance and everything for Saturday night.  Now, I do know some of the black guys, and a lot of them came from South African places on immigration. This weekend was meant to be Canada Day Celebrations. I think that the guys that started it ought to be deported, or SOMETHING. They ruined it for a lot of people. One time, I met up with a guy who went to jail for 30 days and had to pay a hefty fine for disrespecting Canadian Currency. He was caught trying to smash the middle out of the Two-nie. So, if he got in that much trouble for fucking with Canadian Currency, shouldn't these assholes get in A LOT of shit for ruining Canada Day Celebrations. Ok, so maybe deportation is a bit harsh. But what a disrespect to this country! Our whole town waits every year for the Street Dance to roll around! And because of these stupid assholes, it got called off? I dunno... My niece got punched in the face by one of them. They were literally trying to start a riot. They were beating up on girls, guys, you name it, and they were also throwing around racial slurs (white trash, white honky bitch, etc) What the fuck is that shit????  So, went to my brother and sister inlaws on Saturday night instead for summore karaoke. Had a great time. Then we all got drunk, and I did something incredibly stupid. I actually really feel bad for it. There was a whole shitload of us there, including Kev and Mel. Well, they broke up but have a baby together that's under a year old. Well, since the split, Kev has found himself a new woman. She kept phoning and phoning and phoning Jim and Marlene's to try and talk to Kevin. In other words, she was being an obsessive freak. So, I dunno, I was loaded, I picked up the phone, and told her that Kevin and Melissa were a family again, and to fuck off and stop phoning. Kevin HAS in fact been fucking Melissa still, and I know he still loves her. I think this new girl is just a space fill in, so whatever. I was only saying what people were telling me to say. I am not the type of person to start shit like that anymore. Well I guess the girlfriend went and called Kev this morning and told him what I'd said to her (at Marlene's coaching) Hell, I dunno. I was drunk. Kev went over to Marlene's and just LOST IT. Now, I heard 2 different stories. Marlene and everyone said that Marlene took her part of the responsibility, and admitted that she told me to say what I said and all that, and that I had no idea what in the hell was going on. But, Kevin called me to ream me out, but before he did, I told him number one that I was extremely sorry for what I had done, and number two that I accepted full responsibility for it. Being drunk, in my eyes is no excuse to do that. I don't even know the girl. So, pretty much right away, he was cool with me. He said that he was just totally blown away by the fact that I would do such a thing to him. He also told me that Marlene put the whole thing on me. I don't know. The 'Old' Marlene might have, but we're dealing with a 'New' Marlene here. She's not the rotten bitch that she used to be. She's changed a lot. He told me though that he accepted my apology and he knew that Marlene had probably instigated it. So, it's all over with now. Everyone's friends again, and all that.  I have this friend called Matt.  Well, this sorta dates back to when my friend Jeff came out of the closet. I don't know if I've posted this already, but I was telling Matt that Jeff finally had come out of the closet. So, Matt says to me "Yeah well that's good. I think that your a lesbian too". Um, yea ok. So, what do I do? I defend myself. "I'm not a fucking lesbian. But, while we're on the topic, I've had my thoughts about your sexual orientation as well". That was last week. That was the only comment I made to him, and I can't believe it... He's STILL carrying it on. He got SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO offended by that it wasn't even funny. He came over here yesterday and just kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on... Fuck, it was enough to drive me nuts. And this is a 44 year old man we're talking about here. Then today, he sends me an email bitching at me AGAIN for it. I couldn't believe it. He got so fucking offended. So, I wrote him back and basically said something along the lines of him being able to dish it out, but can't take it in return. He's so childish. I am one of the only people that puts up with his shit. He talks behind everyone's back (probably mine too) he treats people like shit, he appears to have a real hatred on for women... i could go on and on. I dunno... I think he's a misanthrope! That's what I think. But, I'm so close to just telling him to fuck right off, because I almost can't stand his shitty attitude anymore. His 20 year marriage fell apart, and now it's like he's blaming the rest of the world for it. He has no intention of taking responsibility for anything. He tries to get dates with women, but when he does do it, they brush him off, because after the first meeting, his true colors come out. And I've tried to open his eyes to it, but he keeps them closed. He blames the women for not wanting anything to do with him. He once told me he's 'picky'. He's not picky. He's an asshole that hates the world and everyone in it, and wants everyone to take responsibility for his actions. I dunno, I gotta go. I'm starting to get mad just thinking about it. I know this though. I want to try and better myself, have fun in life with my kids, my man, get done school all that kinda stuff, and its people like that that bring me down.  Oh and stupid bitchface Lorreen moved out yesterday. When I'm really bored one night, I'll write all about her. ;)
