Erm, back to college again for some UCAS days which are helpful but i'm yet again still confuggled on what i want to do and where i want to take my life, i mean yea Uni would be a great experience and i'd gain a degree and be well proud of myself, but i don't know what i want to do so therefore don't know what degree i want? I want to work as well purely for money reasons and the fact i am greedy and want money to a, spend and b, see piling up in my account. Mates wise everything is cool, i dislike 6th form with a passion but can't do much about that now, could move but is there much point? Plus it would put me closer to Jason and Laura's ever growing sexual encounters and i don't think i could stand seeing them two all day together, would do me in so much, and Tom would be there, don't get me wrong hes a great mate but sometimes i just feel he smothers me too much...  I am desperately looking forward to the holidays, chance to relax, work and see my mates with no hassle of times or dates or coursework etc.  I keep thinking about Jason and Laura, especially when i know that they sleep together, i guess they are a couple now, but for some reason my brain isn't picking up on that bit? Even now when i write it down it doesn't seem to register that he could very well say i love you to her very soon? If i hear that or get told, then i don't know, not thats its my place to have an opinion but i won't like it very much... I try to stay neutral but my feelings just get caught up in it all and then i feel yucky again, and the cycle continues.  ~Lisa~
