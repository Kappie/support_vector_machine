So we push harder and the harder we push the more the force works. Maybe it's Fate, maybe it's the Universe. Who knows. I spent the day with Jessie today and that felt good. It felt good to just be next to a friend again and not be so alone. I mean being alone is good sometimes but being alone too much can only be described as a well. A big friggin well full of water..And you're the cat. Horrible comparison I know but bare with me, I'm in mourning. And I'm also very frustrated. Highly frustrated. And creatively constipated. And that's even worse than being constipated physically. *sigh* Not to mention, I'm a little more emotional than usual because of..ahem...circumstances I'm not comfortable speaking about online where people can read about them. Lately I just feel tired and upset and desperate for an outlet. So I'm looking into writing..Well, I've been big into writing before but I took a vacation when school started. Now I'm starting to get the itch though I'm not sure where to begin. Beginnings are always shaky for me but if I start things right they usually get better..Really better. *sigh* Designing characters have usually been pretty easy for me but I want to get better. Good luck finding books with help to create a character. I know you don't want a list of regular questions because that would make your character 2 dimensional but just a few guidelines so I would know where to start. lol Listen to me prattling on and on. I'm horrible when it comes to that. Well..The sketch pad calls to me. Until my next depressing entry.
