So he's shovelling them into this bucket with a metal shovel when this guy comes up and starts flipping out. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING! IS THAT A METAL SHOVEL? WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY? You gata use a RUBBER shovel! Go get one over at the supply hut. You're lucky the boss didn't see you." So then John (my cousin) went over to the supply place but they told him that he had to go somewhere else to get a rubber shovel. They sent him all over the place. Finally someone took pity on him and said "look kid, there's no such thing as a rubber shovel." When dad told that story mom was all "awe, poor john" I was all... laughing uncontrollably. I really have to try something like that sometime. Hmm... new freshmen this year...
