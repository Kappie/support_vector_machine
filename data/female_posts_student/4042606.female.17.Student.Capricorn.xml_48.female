A Figure In October  is my first project, and is different from any other short story I have ever written, that's right, this is the first time I am actually focusing on the details of people rather than the enviroment. We will see how it goes, I may switch back to my regular style afterwards. I think Part 1 of  A Figure In October  might be able to be posted tonight if I can finish it before 10:00 pm, and if the website allows such a giant upload. I actually may end up spliting Part 1 in to, two segments.   We will soon see
