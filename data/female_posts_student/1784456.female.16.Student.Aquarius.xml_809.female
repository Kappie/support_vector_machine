She's like supremo 'don't worry i bet if we keep walking another say six miles then we'll get some where' and 'every road leads to home'! We went to Cadbury camp and ended walking about two miles to nowhere and found ourselves just down the road, apparantly we'd walked around in a big circle! Ooh fun! Then we made dad buy some strawberries *I'm having a very bad spelling day!* and then we walked back. Oh, I forgot to mention... OW MY KNEES! They kill, most of it was up and down hill, not flat and my knees hate that! (They're very particular) Any way, then my foot started hurting and it got very stupid, I'm okay now (I took some drugs) Yeay for drugs! Oook so slightly hyper... and bored! Come on people de-bore me! Mmm... nooo MORIS DANCERS! Can't... take... it... zzz... (Random huh?)
