It was a slaughter.. the other team was taller, and way bigger than any of the guys on are team..(even if you combined some) Our guys were trying so hard- but they just kept getting pushed around out there. I felt bad for the kids, they tried so hard and lost by 15 points...   10 a.m  Writing class- It was fun this week cause we covered poetry! We did these awesome poetry exercises and I even got to read one of mine. It's hard being the only teenager in a room full of expierenced writers, but I lived. Afterwards I approached the teacher and asked if he had and suggestions on my poem. What he said next straight nearly put me in my grave. He told me that he would'nt change a word of it- it was perfect like it was. And once more, he liked it! I was like... wow. I was so excited I didn't stop smiling for like.. a whole hour. (Can you tell that I like the word like? I'm not a valley girl I swear it...)   1:35 p.m  Me and my mom head out shopping not knowing what we were going to find. We decided to head over to payless to check out shoes. Come to find out- they had the *cutest* black dress shoes you could possible ever find- so she bought them for me! Wee-hoo (carmens modified version of Woo-hoo)! I have prom shoes to go with my prom dress! We asked where we might find a cute purse and went there. After finding the perfect purse me and my mom were getting wiped- so we headed over to a card store to buy a thank you card. Barnes and Nobles was next on the store hit list, mainly because we needed coffee. For dinner- we got chinese takeout and took it home. It was really strange.. cuz I cracked my fortune and it said "You are almost there." I was like- almost where?! It was a profound moment.    Finito
