Today's been a completely uncanny day.   Went to visit my "friend" Dr. Morris first thing in the morning, an episode that resulted in his taking the freedom to prove me an utter historical imbecile. Of course, the fact that I simply passed out on my homework last night as opposed to studying the material that I was to be tested over in history today didn't help- hence, I really didn't know anything.  (So much for a "wake-up call" to help me stop procrastinating as badly as I've been doing lately.)  I am so going to bring him some advanced sight reading next week when I see him again. We'll see whether he really does know "everything."        I suppose the partial pleasant diversion that I acquired from that visit was talking to Jay, who was also liquidating supposed chemistry class time at the office. Collogued about Chemistry, of course, but it was great to see the humorous expression on a younger kid's face as soon as Jay left- he was looking as though he were trying to comprehend a different language- and, really and truly, it is.    Talked about death and calculus applications in relation to it in calculus. Fun stuff.  Mrs. Dunn thinks I'll do exceedingly well on my AP Calc final examination. But no pressure.    Today, choir was very depressing.  First of all, the song we worked on for the majority of the period was very grievious and disconsolate. It pertained to false love and the way young love can be unbelievably exciting, but as it grows older, it often fades away. Yeah.  Secondly, B really ruffled. I don't blame her; we don't have a very good choir at all this term, particularly as far as willingness to achieve anything meaningful together goes. The guys are awful; they're mostly sophomores, so that, I suppose, kind of serves to explain the problem, and some are just insanely obnoxious cases, although some of the seniors, who could set a good example, simply join in the immaturity. It's pretty bad.    B was extremely serious, and I don't think I've ever seen her reach that degree of anger in my 3 years of acquaintance with her. I actually pitied her.  By the time the end of class rolled around, I felt really odd as it was, what with the morbid day and the appalling piece.  In the last five minutes of class, we sang "May You Always Have a Song". As B played the introduction, she asked us to really think about what the piece was communicating. She played the music really well, too, and as B can't ever play piano parts well, I was impressed and realized that she had priorly been working on it.  Anyway, we started singing, and at one point I could hardly release any sound from how very moved I was. It really is an intense composition, and I was forced to battle the tears. So call me a crybaby.   It really reminded me of what music is all about, and B helped reinforce the concept afterwards while utter stillness settled.   She's a very talented woman, and she really cannot help the attitude of the group she has to work with. I can see why she gets so bitter and frustrated. Sadness struck as she vocalized the way she felt about music with a tone of disappointment after we finished "May You Always Have a Song". She said, "It brings everyone together, and we learn to live together... through music. And it's wonderful. That is what I wanted when I chose this path..."  I could relate to everything she'd said, including that disappointment. While singing the song, I realized that lately, I don't "always have a song", and I'm not always "filled with love", and the sun doesn't always "shine above". And while I want music to "be a part of the joy within my heart", it can't be because all sorts of crap-the craziness of things and the rushed pace at which everything moves, the pressure, the pain, solitude and its coolness- seem to stand in the way and never get out of it, lately.    On the bright side, walking outside for a minute almost stopped my breath because of the natural beauty surrounding me. I was reminded of God and of how I can't walk this walk alone.    I'm just tired.     I think I'll take a nap and get to work, as I have a lot to do and can't afford to ever fall asleep on my homework again.      "Stop Whispering" by Radiohead   And the wise man said I don't want to hear your voice And the thin man said I don't want to hear your voice And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do  Stop whispering, start shouting Stop whispering, start shouting  And my mother said let me spit on you son some more And the building said let me spit on your face some more And the feeling is that there's something wrong Because I can't find the words and I can't find the song  Stop whispering, start shouting Stop whispering, start shouting  Dear Sir, I have a complaint Can't remember what it is  It doesn't matter anyway It doesn't matter anyway
