One of them cut herself on the broken glass, so then went running through our neighbor's house getting blood on the walls. naturally, both started screaming for help ( how stupid do you get? breaking into a house, then yelling for help. oh, wait, they were drunk). my mom and stepdad called the police. we later found out one of the girls had alcohol poisoning. surprise surprise. i slept through it all, but i spent the next morning washing blood off of the walls of my neighbor's house. ah, good fun. point being, i don't like to walk around by myself at night. additionally, my parents would flip. i've done it though. when i was little i was paranoid. i was probably nearing OCD about locking doors. this is all explicable. see, at age 8 i lost my father to a heart attack. it was then that night scared me. not because of any monsters or anything. it was because i feared death. i feared that unending darkness and unknown, never seeing anything again. just stuck, 6 feet under for all of eternity, unseeing, unfeeling, unthinking. to an eight-year-old, this was terrifying. then my dreams got to me, and i started fearing killers, kidnappers, and those of that ilk. you see where this is heading? i had to make sure personally that everything got locked. on a side note, i've had a car key since i was about seven. we locked the keys in the car in loveland. i had to reach through the window to pull the lock up. i've had a key ever since. i think these incidents explain my personality a lot. some people claim that we're born with our personalities the same as when we are much older. i disagree. i think that we are the sum of every one of our experiences. as young children, we all seem to have much the same personalities. maybe it's because we have no way to express ourselves. maybe we haven't experienced that one thing that unlocks our true selves. maybe we haven't learned to act. come to think of it, i believe both. we have a basic individual personality, but we also change. we're molded by our lives, our fears, our friends, our families, and our experiences. for example, my stepdad has played quite a significant role in teaching me how not to care about other people's opinions of me. i used to try a lot harder to be nice. it's been a while, ad most of you probably didn't know me then. i have changed. take this for an example. freshman year. i was different. i was still the person i was in middle school, withdrawn and quiet as hell. meeker. more passive. i don't exactly dislike that person i was, but i don't exactly like her either. one day, at the bus stop, some total stranger came up to me and asked me if i wanted to be his girlfriend. in a blind panic, i said no and got onto the nearest bus, called my stepdad, and stayed calm. the guy followed me onto the bus and sat nearby smiling creepily at me. fucking stalkers. i kept my head, and got off at the bagel store, where it would be easy to lose him if he followed me. he didn't. from there it was easy. but i was still shaking. i was scared to ride the bus. then think of this: when you hit high school, it's still a big world and it's still a scary one. three years later, man those freshmen are little. they look so short. perspective is a funny thing. point being: people change. all the time. had you told me at the end of 8th grade who my friends would be now, what i am like now, i wouldn't have believed you. every day our eyes open a bit more. every achievement, every failure, every single fucking word we say, it changes us. not as much as some maj0r things, but i to be cliche, it takes a lot of drops of water to fill the ocean. see, look at this entry. most of you didn't know this stuff about me. i've just changed. correction: perspective is a fucked up thing. it's like that one calvin and hobbes, where everything goes out of perspective. it looks funny. see? i have a point. and i justr looked at the top of this entry. i have seriously gone beyond digression. longest tangent ever.      back to before: my point was that i'm sleeping weirdly for me. i get tired earlier. i'm still on my winter park sleeping schedule. the one where i collapse, exhausted, unable to keep my eyes open, and wake up early. i hate this schedule. night is a far better time to think and wander and write in this damnable thing. i hate this feeling where i need to write here, but i also love it. i'm creating a record of my life. it's a weird feeling. between the three places i write things, i will remember my life in my latter teenage years. barrett told me the other day that if there aren't any pictures of me, i won't remember me. not true. these words say so. look at this. whether we like it or not, our personality spills into our writing. it's called style. no matter what we write, it still reflects us. communication is the mirror of our personality. everything we show the outside world. it makes more sense put that way. we're a collection of mirrors. some people only have one. those are those open people with nothing to hide and no reason to hide it. they're a single mirror that shows everything. for some reason i associate happiness with a single mirror. the more mirrors, the more complex. the darker. i'm stuck in IB-theme world again. again and again with the fucking mirrors. this reminds me of an arcana quote: "each of these many mirrors here is like a window to your memories... would you like to find out what happens if they start breaking?" --yoshiki.       i've had nothing to do so i've just been writing. stream of consciousness thing. don't mind me. i don't. this is an unusual entry for this thing. usually i do this to my lj. not so today.       do you ever go back and retrae your writing? you know, go over it again and again until it's thick and dark and closer to perfect? it's like circles. there's no way you can draw a perfect circle unaided. but if you draw them over and over and over again, eventually there are so many circles there that it looks closer to perfection. i'd like to say that there's some sort of deeper moral in that, but if there is i can't put my finger on it right now. well, there are a couple, but nothing i feel is worth comtemplating.      something emily said to me the other day is bothering me. what if all these people i think i kn0w really are just imagined? what if i imagined them to reflect my bad points? to be all i can't be. so that if they all merged into me, i would come closer to becoming the ideal. we all have our weaknesses. we all know we do. nobody's perfect. deep down, we're all selfish. deep down, we're just trying to survive. deep down, we're still imbued with that desire to be the fittest. deep down, we're all trying to make our lives the best, the easiest, the least trying. come on, who the fuck is happy with what they've got?   no one is happy to admit weakness.  no one is ever truly completely happy with how they are.  everyone has shortcomings, and some of us fill them with apathy, but it's still a weakness.  it never stops being one.  never.      only five more hours.
