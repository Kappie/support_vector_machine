God I know I had something I wanted to say.... I just don't remember now. Eh, I don't feel like typing. Tomorrow night I'm going with Josh and Charlotte (and other people who dont' matter as much) to a corn maze (woo!) and Haunted House. That'll be fun. But I'll talk later cause I don't feel like it now. Oh yeah my neighbor's dog Misty that I walk afterschool is dying! It's soooo soo sad. She's not eating, peeing, or drinking. It's almost like she wants to die. (she's real old by the way). It's so sad when dogs are in pain.. they're so sweet and innocent...awww poor Misty. So yeah I think there goes my dogwalking gig ($10 a week, NOT BAD for just walking a sweet little old dog) by this weekend probably.  She does NOT look good. Oh well I know you guys don't care. Anyway, I'll type somethin later maybe.
