I know i didnt leave it in my classes....My mom suspects that some desperate student took it to copy my answers, notes, homework or take away my papers.  I'll just go and die in a nearby pothole in the road if i don't get it back tomorrow.  *starts banging head on desk* Why me?  Why me?  Why me of all people?  What did i do to deserve this?  Die, Die, DIE!
