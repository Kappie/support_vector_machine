As I mentioned before, I think it's a wonderful thing, I support it and yet there's nothing more frustrating than being stuck at Union Station carrying 20lbs worth of crap and trying to get home on overcrowded subways.  I managed to time my trip perfectly so I wouldn't coincide with the revellers coming into or out of the downtown core.  I did my fourth (out of five) practice test for the exam for tomorrow.  Scored 94%.  I can dig it.  I hope tomorrow's is as palatable.  Off to get some grub.  More to come...
