Read his entry for March 4th.  It is interesting what he says. I agree with him. But it is the way things are and how our society is.  Well i am going to be 24 in a week. I getting old. I have a secret for you. I have never told anyonw this. But i have a fear of getting old. Be cause if i am getting old then so is everyone i love and care for. I do not feel 24. I think that is because i have been working with kids and teens since the year 2000. Oh well getting old is not going to stop me from living. I have not even started homework yet. My cousin invited me to go for a ride to the public library. It is so nice and warm out here. Anyways i have to get going. Have a nice day!
