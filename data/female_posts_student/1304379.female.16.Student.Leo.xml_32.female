Anyway wishes  never  do come true, that's why there's this thing called - Wishful thinking.  I was "reminiscing" my past mistakes, i'm quite shocked at how blind I was to see that what I did was terribly terrible. I  was  truly blinded by my own fault. Blinkered vision or whatever you say. I used to feel that denying is a good way to forget things you do not want to remember. Man. I cannot be anymore wrong[er] than that. I love Morrie. [nb:  tuesdays with Morrie ] In the book, it was said, "Accept the past as past, without denying it or discarding it." I follow lots of his rules to live ya know? That's why I truly encourage people around me to read it. It's fantabulous. =]  Few of my favorites,  "Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others. Ask for forgiveness from others. Forgiveness can soften the heart, drain the bitterness, and dissolve the guilt."  "Accept your doubts about your ability to achieve any change in your emotional state. But keep trying. You might be surprised."  And.. I'll probably blog more later/ tomorrow.  //anyway, if you noticed, i've just re-formatted my layout. Why? Yes, you've got it. Damn blogger screwed up again. They love cutting away my bottoms. [of the layout] As for the links and such, i'll link them up  again  if Habibi wins the elections. Wait, he's dead isn't he? HAHAHHA. Okay, if Megawati wins the elections.
