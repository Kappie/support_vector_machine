I stopped home to change for the gym.  I'm off to Tikva's for her 5:30 lesson, then to Christy's for the gym.  She might stay the night- Debbie has requested that I bring my "funny friend who called on the cell phone" to work tomorrow so the three of us and Vanessa, a playmate of hers, can go see a movie.  Around the World in 80 days, anyone? Also, Lola is having her first official test drive by a promising buyer.  *Sniff, Sniff* I'll miss her, just not the gas prices in SD. Which reminds me- Ivana said something funny on the phone last night.  Part of a good convo:   Me:  Gosh I hate the gas prices, though.  So painful. Ivana:  Yeah, no kidding. Me:  What do you pay down there in Texas? Ivana:  A dollar seventy, something. Me: ...silence... (under my breath @$*%!!!) Ivana: What? Me:  I'm like $2.15, 2.20 if I'm lucky... Ivana: Premium?!?! Me:  I wish...  Yeah.  I'm paying for my own gas this summer, so a little part of me dies every time the dial moves down a notch on the tank meter.  The $135 paycheck I just got from TIS makes me feel a tad better, however.  Off to work and make more $$$...
