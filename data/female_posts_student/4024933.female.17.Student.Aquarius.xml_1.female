I think what hurt the most is when he said it shouldnt matter because hes leaving anyway...So i said true just make sure you call me to say bye when you leave. sighs*...I'm really confused on what kinda relationship we had and even after i asked him he still couldnt explain it...i asked him did he like me as a sister, girlfriend, buddy buddy, orassociate....he said he doesnt know....its a mindboggling mixture.....(a mindboggling mixture wha the f does that mean)....he went on to say that he liked me as a girlfriend in the begining but now he gueses he doesnt like me like that. So i figured i can just stop calling him and leave my door open for when he needs his hair done....like just the fact that he didnt explain to me still if we were friends or not still leaves this unbarely hurt feeling...like i wanna stilldrill him with questions...but i dont want to feel like you know....i just need some time...i dont even know why it hurts like this...but whats done is done....i kinda wish i never said ne thing......
