I've just been searching and searching for some sort of identity. Something to characterize who I am.  And I've made alot of mistakes. In my 'quest', I've done nothing more than alot of finding out who I'm not. But yesterday, as I was driving around, I started to come to some realizations. I started to see the obvious.  My questions started with 'who am I?' and sort of evolved into 'why am I who I am, and who is that really?' It sort of complicated itself. But in a way, it clarified things for me.  I am because of my friends. I am because of the people who are undyingly by my side, through the good and the bad, through the trials and triumphs, through the ups and the downs. There are alot of things in life that come and go: love, relationships, jobs, school, acquantances...even the people you once called your friends may become impermanent and distant with time.  I just feel that sometimes people have a tendency to lose sight of who they are...and I think that for a long time, that's where I've been. And true, it's impossible to say that I won't ever lose sight of that again, because life is about learning and growing and experiencing...and it's short.  And so, to my friends, and be no doubt whether or not I speak of you, I want you to know that you have helped me through everything, and without people like you, I don't know where I would be.  Quite honestly, I don't think I would know who I am.  Thank you.  ...crazies.
