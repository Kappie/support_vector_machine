She thought i was doing drugs, cause i am unhappy and have new friends or something... and my  mom started crying cause she thinks me going to vista is like "running away" or something like that. Oh well. Let someone else psycho-ananalyze her lest my brain explodes.  But anyway, everything is beautiful!!!!!! And i have a gigantic bag of candy, and tomorrows weds and i love dylan and kelly is beautiful and alice is beautiful and my kitty is beautiful and everything rocks.  I gave you stolen flowers, you gave me your last cigarette You'll be in my dreams today Ill run my yellow finger through your yellow hair my yellow teeth will pull off your underwear those shredded fishnet stockings make me remember the way we fucked and youll be in my dreams today...yes youll be in my dreams today..  Im playing with play-doh. play doh is fun. Im letting my inner child run free. And probably naked, cause little kids seem to run around naked a lot....  go take a hike! AND DONT FORGET THE TRAIL MIX, BITCH!  ~abby~
