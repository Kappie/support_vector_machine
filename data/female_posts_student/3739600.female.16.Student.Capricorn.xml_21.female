A lot of people(such as my parents, brothers and even my friends) don't see why I care for him as much as I do. Some times I forget why, as well. But then again, why do I have to have a specific reason for loving a person? Plus it's none of their business. Lord I understand that he and I wont be able to see each other that often when school starts but please give us the strength to hold on to each other and stay true to one another. Help our love grow stronger as each day goes by and protect us from all that is bad and from those who will try to tear us apart. Please be with us each and everyday. I love him to much to let him go again.   Brandi*
