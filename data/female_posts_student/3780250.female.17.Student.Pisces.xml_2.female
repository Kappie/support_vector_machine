I LOVE YOU Anyways I have been looking for a job, getting enrolled in school, and working at my aunt's job until I can fine a steady one, taking care of my couisn he is 11, and trying to keep the house upkept so as you can see i have been busy. i wished  i could have goen to pride with me babygurl but my mom said no but she and I are for sure going next year. YAY well I am finally happy not fully bc shanna and I are still apart but mostly happy. Everyday i have a smile on my face for no reason I love being inlove with a beautiful woman that loves me just the way I am. IF you are single find a beauitful,sexy, smart, funny, caring woman like i got and you will always be happy. I know i am. i couldn't be happier with shanna. Oh my godda i think i am going to marry her and that scares me and excites me. It scares me because i see so many couples break up and get divorced. It excites me because i am so inlove and i love her so much and i knwo that we can make it as long as we have each other. well i need to get Hayden dressed that is my cousin we need to go to town and get food for dinner tonight. I LOVE YOU SWEETHEART
