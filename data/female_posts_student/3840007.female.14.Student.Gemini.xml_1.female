I finished feed, started the traveling pants book..and now i've started HP#4..which has to be done by thursday. lol  so swimming lessons started..im in the big girl level..12!! yay me..it sucks though..it's just laps and laps and then surface dives to find pennies! lol. ya..my neighbour..jeff colletti (??i dont know how to spell his last name..) is in my class. it's funny cause he has long hair..i am bored. LALALA..MASTER OF THE HOUSE..KEEPER OF THE ZOO!Yay! I went to my grandma's house/ my aunt  uncle's 25th wedding anniversary..and my sister made us listen to Les Miserables the whole way there. My family is nuts, my aunt marriane decided to have some drinks before she left her house to make sure she would get through the whole party..and she was drunk before she even got there..I swear. It was funny. My aunt and uncle are rich (her name is  Valentina  for god's sake.)..and their children are too..my aunt and my cousins all have the same platinum blonde hair..and it looks really fake and yuck..they are weird. I sat outside with two of my other aunts and my sisters..and we just sat there..we all didn't feel like going inside the resteraunt and talking to ppl we don't know..so it was fun i guess. Like i said...my family is nuts.
