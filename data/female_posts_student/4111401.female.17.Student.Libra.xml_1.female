I miss him. And there is so much problems going on here, but not a day goes by where i dont look at you - i dont think of you - not a day in which i dont remember how much happiness you gave me. So many times i have wanted to run up to you and hug you, but that can never happen. Too many irreperable issues. And then there are friendships which are in tatters, what the fuck is wrong with me? why cant i approve of Lauren and Rick? why am i mad at nicole and matt? why is matt s a cunt? why did i happen to be fooling aruond with clausen when chris was there,... he was mad... and i call myself a friend? I stare so blankly at this fucking white screen in front of me... mentally cursing every thought going through my head. A peaceful way to cover tracks of confusion, pain and sorrow. I will never be the same person. I am barely a person. Like, lies... so many lies... dont get me started on the lies!! its easier to lie and be someone good that you want to be, than be truthful and be someone that everyone hates. I dont know what i am   i dont know who i am   i dont know why i am   but i know... i am ... nothing
