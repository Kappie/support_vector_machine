When I am in pain, I look into your eyes, And all of my pain disappears.  When I cower in fear, I look into your eyes, And my fear goes away.  When I feel that I might loose you, I look into your eyes, And I know that I can trust you.  When I am worried, I look into your eyes, And I know that everything will be ok.
