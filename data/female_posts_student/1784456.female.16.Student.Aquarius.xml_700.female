I am getting seriously pissed off with this job! No one else will do the extra rounds, so the guy at the shop always expects me to do them, and I always end up having to. Smell. I've been doing it for a ear and a half now, so you can see why I'm just a little fed up. I'm gonna see if I can find something different. But it is kinda fun though, me and my newsie-friends were playing with the musical greetings cards in the shop today, there was one that played "macerina" amd we were all (three of us!!) standing in the middle of the shop doing the macerina, until Simon (ownie-type-guy) came along and told us off. :(
