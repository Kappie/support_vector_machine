I know that I'm as guilty as the next person, but I do try call if I promise, and if I don't, I usually call later with an apology.  It irritates me when "friends" don't do what they say they will. I understand that shit happens, but come on. This comes under my last rant of personal responibility.   On the other hand, I do have friends that go above and beyond the call of duty. They know who they are.  Miranda  really came through me this week. I was rather upset at a friend one evening, and she and I got to talking about it, and she invited me over to talk about it - at 4 in the morning. Now that is a friend. Thanks girl!  Another friend who has been there for me this week is  Scott . He has hooked me up not only with a job interview, but also a place to live given the opportunity to live in south Florida. He and I have become much better friends over the years. I'm glad he's my friend.  Times of trouble prove who your friends are. Sometimes they come out of the woodwork, sometimes you are extremely surprised at who they really are. While I can't say that I would be there for   everyone   that I know, but I would be there for those I care for. The people you party with and the people that are true friends are very rarely the same crowd - or at least it is in my experience.   I once asked  Jon  (before I dated  Davis ) "Do you think its strange that I'm 23 years old and I've never had a relationship that lasted longer than a month?" He looked up at me, looking me in the eyes, and with a serious tone he replied, "No, I don't think its strange. You're smart and you know that we [boys] are all worthless."  I have been rather amazed at what boys will say and do to girls to get what they want. I've heard that they are wired differently, and I am really beginning to believe it. I know guys who say "I don't mean to hurt you" or "I don't want to hurt you", yet, they still do. They do things that can only hurt people. Not only does it hurt the girl that they do it to, but also their own friends. Sometimes the scope of pain that is caused by one person is much further reaching than an individual can possibly imagine. It pains me to know that someone that says that he cares for me would do things that hurt. I'm not only referring to myself and my friendships with fellows, but also my sisters and other girlfriends and their relationships with boys.    When there is smoke, there is usually a fire.     post script I know not all guys out there are bad - as a matter of fact many of you are wonderful. This entry was just inspired by 3 guys from this week that annoyed me for one thing or another.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  On a happy note, I had a job interview with  Disney  yesterday for a six-month job in corporate skills training. Basically, it works like this. You work basic corporate jobs, they give you a place to live, and you learn how the corporation works. At the end of the six months, you can stay on if you liked it. I'm rather excited about this job. I had a good laugh with  Mom today. I said, "So when I'm asked what I'm doing after graduation, I'm saying 'I'm going to Disney World'". Hah.  I have a job interview on Friday with  Edward Jones Investments  in Ft. Myers. Wish me luck!  I have yet to hear from the foreign service, and its getting really annoying now... I NEED TO KNOW. Ugh.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I finally got some allergy medication, and now for the first time in about a week I can sit at my computer, with my cat of course, and not feel like I want to die. Yay.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The other night, while talking to  Rick  on the phone, I broke into tears about my leaving Valdosta. That was a first. Usually I cried because I couldn't leave Valdosta. Its not that I'm not ready to leave, I am. Its that I do have some great connections here. Starting in a week and a half, I'm going to start my official goodbyes here in Valdosta. Scott did that when he left, and it actually meant alot to me, even though we keep in touch. So, taking my experience, I'm going to do the same.
