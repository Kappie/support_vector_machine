But the whole time i was sure that someone or something was following me....it was just weird.  GOSH! i hate this...i wanted to say outside but noooooo i have a 7 oclock kerfew....at my favorite time...NIGHT TIME! i have to go inside and just watch the moon from my window every night cuz i have a kerfew dammit! I love the night time...it gives me excitement..i don't know what it is but when the moon is out its just...beautiful and unexplainable. I love night time...i only come out at night cuz its nice and cool and exciting and fun cuz u can't see anything lol.   BUT NO!...my parents that are just ruining my life make me come inside and keep me away from something cool.   Oh ya and Josh is sleeping over sometime this week lol.  Franny:) lol  Hopefully Francesca can come over...she will i know it lol    Totally pissed off.................
