Yes, cup dispensers can be a bit of trouble for one sleep deprived person such as myself. There is a typical order in which things must been done to battle a cup dispenser.   1. Get the cups.  2. Slip on the wet floor.. but gracefully catch yourself mid fall.  3. Reach the ominous looking cup dispenser.  4. Lay cups down and grab the order for drive-thru.  5. Return to the cups only to be interrupted by another customer at drive thru.  6. Unwrap the cups from the plastic they were packaged in.  7. *Ding* "Go ahead with your order" (its not like I was busy anyways). 8. Try and hold back the plastic things while at the same time trying to shove a 3 foot column of cups into the dispenser. 9. Fix the bends in the cups from not succeeding the first time. 10. Breathe in and Out, try again.  11. *DING* "I would like an ice cream thing." "Maam, that is served at the restaurant around the building." 12. You get the cups in the cup dispenser and all is well.  13. You find out there is no lids.  And so the saga continues until you are fortunate enough to clock out. Which so happens to be another 5 hours and 45 minutes away. Good Luck.
