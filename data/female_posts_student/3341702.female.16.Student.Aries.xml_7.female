My meds aren't fully working anymore...I've been getting depressed really easily lately and I've almost broken down at work at least twice...which isn't good. *shrug* I dunno. I guess I'm just tired of feeling sad and I wanna feel better...but it's not working!  But yeah..I have work next weekend too...5:30 on Friday and Saturday, and then 10 again on Sunday. Grr...But Jeremie's last day at Texas Roadhouse is on Friday!! ^^ yay!! That means he'll be working at Rock Garden with me sooooooon! ^^;  Anywayz..I dunno. I couldn't get on my damn computer yesterday cuz it was being extremely stupid...damn computer. It wouldn't connect to the internet so I couldn't do anything. So I called Jeremie and ended up talking to him for like...4 hours (I should note, we almost never talk on the phone...so its amazing that we talked for that long..^^). But I got cut for work when I was supposed to...so that was a good thing. But yeah..I had Gail freak out at me for a bunch...so I got really depressed towards the end of our convo..cuz..yeah...Gail's a bitch and she enjoys making me feel like shit.  Other than that...not much is really going on today. I, for some odd reason, can't find my ID or my poetry folder...so I'm kinda ticked about that...but I'll prolly find them tonight. (If you wanna see my poetry...go  here  ^^)  Yeah..that's all I really have for now...baiobaio! *waves*
