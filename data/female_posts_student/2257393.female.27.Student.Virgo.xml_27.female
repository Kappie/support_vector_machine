(at this point in the tap, i started thinking about how unbelievably messed up it was to have a freaking tap installed into my back.  this feeling was not unlike the experience i had in the hospital when i was connected to the IV and the electrodes.)    he took four vials of spinal fluid from my back.  four vials of clear and colorless fluid.  i don't know what i was expecting my spinal fluid to look like, but i didn't think it would look like water.  i guess i thought it would be more body-colored--yellow or pink or red or something full of stuff.  dr. k said that if it had been cloudy or colored, that would have been some sign of bleeding or infection.  i asked if he could tell anything about presence of MS from eyeballing it.  he said, as i suspected, that needed a microscope.    and that was it--he cleaned off the betadyne, put a band-aid over the puncture site, had me lie flat for a little while, and that was that.  i felt fine when it was finished.  no headache, other than the rush to my head when i was able to stretch out from the curved-up, head-down position i was in for the tap.    adrienne was my ride to and from the hospital.  she was in town for the week, and she brought me an autographed picture of will ferrell which, as soon as i can find a suitable frame, will be featured prominently above my mantle.  spent the day with her, watched movies, she beat me in scrabble (further proof that i'm being as honest as possible here--i don't take scrabble lightly).    the headache started to set in around late afternoon.  and it stayed with me all weekend.  this was the weirdest headache--like an extreme version of a sinus headache; my brain felt like it was a balloon in a vaccuum-sealed container in somebody's science-experiment demonstration of how pressure works.  when i would lie down, it would subside, but sitting up or standing was pretty much out of the question.  it had me in tears a few times, partially from the pain, and partially from the inconvenience of having to spend my entire weekend lying down.  this headache didn't respond a bit to any sort of pain medicine, certainly not to the two aleve, the four aspirin, and prescription strength ibuprofen i tried to treat myself with.    i thought it was gone by saturday night, but it must have been the influx of caffeine during the day, because sunday morning it was back.    oh, and did i mention that i've lost my sense of taste, too?  i'm almost positive this is because of the carbamazepine, but it's exceptionally annoying and has made eating miserable.  food has become tactile and bland, and kinda nauseating.
