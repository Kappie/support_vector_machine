VBS) for the kids there. we're also going to do work projects(like painting houses, or cleaning something up, or just doing a whole lot of yard work), community outreach stuff and door-to-door evangelism. the people there are extremely friendly. they can meet a stranger on the street and end up talking for an hour. i am NOT good at talking with strangers or anyone for that matter for extended periods of time. i hope that i know what to say and form relationships on this trip. no scopin' and hopin'-haha. i'm also nervous about the money thing. it costs $800 to go. i am not even CLOSE to that amount. please pray for me.  -stace
