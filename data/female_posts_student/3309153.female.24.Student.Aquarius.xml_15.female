Just wanted to remind group #1, which is Jenny, Doug, Laura, Mary, Amy and Lisa Anne that we will be looking for your first writing piece to arrive for critique in another week or so.  Good luck to everyone during the last week of class/finals for our MAT group. I know that you are relieved that it's almost over.   Also, Ashtons has started a Saturday night open-mic poetry event.  I attended last night and was quite impressed.  The place was packed, and many of the poets were extremely rhythmic.  I saw one published poet, Chris Slaughter, whom I had known in NYC and have heard his work many times... so some experienced people were in the house (as well as some new voices).  I think it would be great for us to go one Saturday night as a group.  I think we could really add a new flavor into the mix.  I purchased a CD from one poet called Freedom Speaks, and she really seemed to have mastered the word play of spoken word. It's a different way to look at writing, and I really think the audience would appreciate our diversity.  If any of you want to attend on the 17th or 24th let me know. It starts at 10:30pm but I only stayed about an hour, although I'm sure the mic was open for quite awhile longer.  One other idea.  I am hoping that we can have a public reading sometime in November.. possibly November 15 since we have extra weeks in that month.  Please be thinking of places to have this and the way you might want to organize the event... or if you even want to do this at all.  Ashtons might be an idea or somewhere different just for a change.  We could serve appetizer at someone's house.. whatever.  I just thought that it would be cool to invite those we care about to come and hear our work.  If anybody wants to head up the endeavor, let me know.  Hope the words are flowing and everyone is doing well!  Until next time... Amanda
