We hiked up a mountain of rocks in the middle of the desert for shells....lol. Saw wild burros and took pictures with them too...they was neat.  Went to dinner tonite with mis padres and saw a hot guy....uh, yuh.  P.S. I hate getting in the romantic-chick flick mood and wanting a boyfriend....this sucks
