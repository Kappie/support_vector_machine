But I always felt like when someone makes a slight error it is ok to laugh cause it usually is funny. Maybe I am wrong. I even laugh at myself at all the stupid things I do. Since when do people take that so seriously? Will people just lighten up and have fun? Sheesh, don't blame me for being the laughing person that I am.      Moving on, today was hot stuff. I woke up kind of on the early side just because I felt like it. I watched some televsion with my sister. My brother was getting ready for work and asked me to make him some grilled cheese sandwiches. For doing so he paid me $2. Yay me! Yesterday he paid me $1 just to get him something to drink. Well after my mom, Leah, and Dusty left I decided I would wash the dishes. So I washed them and then watched more tv. My dad came home from work and then I decided to take a shower. After I got out of the shower I ate some dinner and then in a few hours I was on my way to the Healthplex to play volleyball. While I was standing there waiting for the basketball guys to get done I realized I knew one of them. It was Terry Webster (an Eagledalian who left in the 7th grade). I kinda was hesitate to ask if it was him, but the moment I said his name he looked at me and said "Hey Br√®!" I felt much better. We chit chatted a bit and then he left and I played some volleyball. Leah actually went to play with me tonight. She enjoyed it alot. After volleyball, Brad, Leah, William, and I went to Sonic to eat, duh. I had two hot dogs. I love hot dogs. Then we had an ice spitting fight and that was fun stuff. Now I am home finishing up my cherry slush. I am hoping there is a cherry at the bottom with a stem that I can tie. You have heard the saying, if you can tie a cherry stem into a knot with your tongue you are a good kisser? Well, if not, now ya know. I was amazed how little people knew of that. But keep in mind, I have done it more that once...hehehe, you know what that means. Ok, I will stop.      Ok, well I am going to get off here now and find something to do. Hmm, maybe I will eat some Runts. I love Runts! They are muy muy muy deliciouso. Dang,my arms feel somewhat tired. Me tired from volleyball? Man, that never happens. Well, until next time, I am outtie!      Music Playin' in The Background: Toxic- Britney Spears
