Actually, it was about narcissism, but it talked alot about blogging. Here's a little snippet:   urlLink It's all about... ME    Tom Schenden, 34, lives in Brea, Calif., and works in health-care marketing. He also keeps an online diary -- an online soap box, really -- filled with whatever strikes his fancy that day.  When he first heard about blogging, "it sounded so dorky," he admitted. But he started an online diary anyway and soon was hooked. "It gave me an outlet to write, it's personally enjoyable. It's a chance to explore my own creative writing and see what people react to."  Schenden actually had two blogs, one of which was written about his personal life, including a divorce, though anonymously. Like almost everyone who decides to share their story with a viewing audience, Schenden latches onto the language of psychotherapy. Everything is "catharsis" these days, as if getting it off your chest is, in and of itself, the most important thing.  "It was fun to be able to spill all," Schenden said. "It's sometimes interesting to get feedback, safe feedback, when no one knows who you are."  Schenden soon shut down the anonymous blog, however, for the simple reason that he could have been exposed -- hurting others, and himself. It's a sentiment no doubt one or two former Sally Jesse Raphael guests have, though they can't so easily tap the "delete" key. How few of them actually think of this before.  The other Schenden blog is a collection of opinions, meted out in paragraph spoonfuls. Like so many online rants, it's like eavesdropping on a conversation at the mall, hearing only snippets of opinion.  None of Schenden's thoughts is publishable in the conventional sense. They're not long enough to be editorials, not developed enough to be articles. Instead, it's a journal, but he wouldn't keep it unless people read it. A personal diary "is not worth doing. I do groove on feedback."  Of course, Schenden himself doesn't read blogs. He just writes one. Sometimes it seems like the whole blog community is this way -- everybody shouting, nobody listening.  It's not my intention to belittle Schenden, or even blogs. If this fulfills him, bravo. And as a journalist, I support any technology that democratizes the written word.  But I'm looking for a little self-censorship. What happened to formulating thoughts, writing them out in private and editing them before publication? Where is the thoughtful analysis in the ravenous beast of a blog updated every day, every hour?  Some days, Schenden doesn't feel like writing in his blog. But he knows there are 20-30 regular readers of his journal, so he starts tapping away anyway. "Then all of a sudden I realize I do have something to say," he said.  Call me old-fashioned, but shouldn't inspiration precede production? Too many things are said, and written, because we're taught that if you have a story, you must tell it. If you have a secret, you must tell it. Expose all.  When, I wonder, does one stay silent?    It makes you feel so narcissistic, huh? Well, c-ya you crazies.
