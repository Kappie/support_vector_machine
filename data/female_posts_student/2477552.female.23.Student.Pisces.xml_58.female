What else is left for the weekend?...  10 pt. extra credit  urlLink Frederick Meijer Garden's Arid Garden  Lab. I only have to make a set of tables and write a one-page report.  A five-point paper telling what our movie was about in GPY 100.   A fourth grammar analysis that is kicking my butt. It's going to take up a  homongous chunk of my time .  Putting together a study plan for my 5 exams.  And finally, working on my psy take home test applying educational psy principles to the movie "Stand And Deliver" which I've seen over 800 times. Somehow each viewing seems new. I hate that. So in two weeks a 7 page paper is due. Great! I'll have to work on it when I go home for Easter.  *I'm eating the last of the rice pudding for breakfast this morning. :) I feel good about it. lol.
