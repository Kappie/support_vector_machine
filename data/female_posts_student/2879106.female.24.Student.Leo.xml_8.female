I needed to make about 80 dollars tonight which I did but then that damn tip share came and took my 80 dollars down to 67. FUCK THAT TIP SHARE!!!! Anyway I will make more tomorrow. Also Alek wrote me saying that he misses me. I am not sure what to think of that considering that missing me doesn't really mean "I want to be with you". Plus I am not all that sure that I want to be with him. Don't get me wrong I love him with all my heart and it is killing me to be without him. BUT I am just not sure if we are supposed to be together. I hate the way life throws you curve balls messing up everything that you thought was so right. It just really sucks!!!! OH WELL life is going to get better!! I mean hell it has already improved since last week. I just try to be optimistic about things in order to see that everything that happens in your life, happens for a reason. Maybe in a couple of weeks I will know why this has been happening to me and everything should be clear. I love myself very much and I hope you love yourself too. (That is if anyone is reading this)
