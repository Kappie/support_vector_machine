But people will have to keep checking and checking. =) Oh well, woop-de-fucking-do for them I don't give a shit. It's not like they actually care. I could die tomorrow and no-one would notice. Except for maybe... Mike. Yeah. He would notice, it would be way to peaceful for him... He's at his place now. Not here. I think he only comes here every two weeks so I won't get too lonesome. Heh. It's alright, I don't care. The only thing I miss is Maxx. Tim's cat. *sob* Him and Lucifer [My cat] got along quite well. But now, I'm stuck with a dog... *GRR* Dog's are nice though. Yeah. Blue is pretty cool.  So, I'll try to update this every couple of days. See if it comes out with anything. =\ Probably not. I really can't spell. >. ,  urlLink DeadJournal ,   urlLink Blurty ] They have all the same layout. Really. It's weird. DeadJournal is a tad bit diffrent though. It's just 'darker' [Der, DEADJournal]  I have one of each. But LiveJournal is my favorite out of the four. I really enjoy MySpace  Melo too. Though I am having some problems customizing [totally spelt wrong] my Melo. Weird. I seems so simple. Oh well. MySpace is my favorite of all. It's awesome. =) Anyway, I must be off. I wrote some new songs for Death, and yeah. Some are really cool. [~]Untalented[~]  Speak of later...right? SmilingShay
