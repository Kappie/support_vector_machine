Great now I sound like a bimbo! Erm... any one heard of pink cheese? (Rubbish subject change, real rubbish) I try my best! :D I'm gonna go watch the triatholon *whatever* now cause we're actually winning it! I seriously need a holidiay, I'm so grouchy! Well, slight other reason for that but any way. Ever noticed that cheese is actually pink? *sigh* (You tried that already) Right, right, just checking if you were watching/listening! My brother has a leather *whatever* jacket! and some sandles, he bought them yesterday! Slight difference, I mean boiling hot jacket and freezing cold sandles...? Mmm, but any way the jacket was £20 cause it had a rip in it but the man said you can fix it back together with tip-ex! Okay, okay I'm going! Bubi peeeps! *sob sob* See you in either two weeks or see you tomorrow! I might go on the net on Spain... but I'll probably be extra hyper and happy! (Scary!)
