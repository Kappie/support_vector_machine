I went to bed last night around 3 or 4.. and then I woke up a lil after noon.. my mom woke me up cause I had to call Emily. Then I went over to her house.... we went SHOPPING!! HORRAY! I got something for Robbey A. at Urban Outfitters.. that's a tyte store. They were these "smart" pencils.. lol.. they are cool.. Then I got a frappacinuo at Startbucks. It was gooooddd. Haha I got some undies at Victoria's Secret and then some Bazooka Bubble Gum at Virgin Records. Haha so now I am broker than BROKE!! So is Emily, and she owes me $3!! She just HAD to get this purse for GAP.. whatever. Just because I am such a good friend!! Plus she used her giftcard ($20).. and the purse was $22.99. Anyways.. when we got back we just hung out around the house for a lil while. And then we went swimming.. it was fun. We wrapped out goggles around our feet and then we tried to swim. It was difficult and FUN!! After we got out and took a shower, we begged Emily's dad to take us to TCBY. He said NO!! :'(. So we made our own sundaes.. YAY!! ok well I am gunna go.. later.
