A typical breakfast is fruit (papaya, strawberry, pineapple, banana) Huevos rancheros, bacon, toast, fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee. Lunch the other day was poblano chilies stuffed with spicy meat, grilled Portobello mushroom caps stuffed with spinach, and a tossed salad. At night we eat out at the excellent restaurants all over town. We typically walked to dinner via the Jardin to see what is going on there. The entire social life of San Miguel centers around the Jardin or town square. After dinner it is back to the Jardin to see what is happening. The other night I hired a Mariachi band to serenade Laura and me. She was kind of embarrassed but she got over it and really enjoyed it I think.    We have taken some driving day trips out into the country that have been a lot of fun. The kids especially have enjoyed seeing the peasants toiling in the fields. I hope it will help them appreciate how good they have it. Meagan is completely absorbed with HTML programming. She has taught herself computer code and is building her own website from scratch. I have to insist she gets out and goes sightseeing with me at least once a day or she would never leave the computer. Ben is girl crazy. He met three girls from San Antonio and is panting around with them, showing them way too much attention. We have tried to explain to him to play it cool and act like he is not that interested, but he just can’t make himself do it. This morning he informed me that “Women are impossible. They are so weird.” I hope he truly has learned that, because I still forget it, and assume women periodically think like me.    Lately we have been getting a cooling shower for about one hour everyday at around 4:30. It cools it off from 80 to 72 and then quickly goes away leaving no trace of rain 30 minutes after it has stopped. The weather is absolutely perfect here. I love napping (siesta) during the rain storms.     The Vickery’s, some friends of ours from Houston are coming to spend a long weekend in San Miguel. They are arriving Thursday and going home Sunday. I hope they enjoy this place as much as we do.
