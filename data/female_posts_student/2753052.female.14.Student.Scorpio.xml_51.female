I went to my friend merri's house and was tortured by 10 yr olds (aka merri's brother joey and his stupid friend eric).Eric screamed across the yard to his 14 yr old brother that i don't even know(staying at neighbor's house) that i was a hooker and would give him a dance in my underwear, also that i would show him my boobs and vagina. How lovely just about the whole neighborhood heard. So then I told Eric that i loved himto freak him out. He said sorryi don't feel the same way or someshit i really freaked him out it was awesome.To get them back even morefor this me and merri made them popcorn and drenched it in hot sauce, but it backfired as they ate it and loved it. Actually they didn't even tastethe hot stuffthey thought it was blood but we told them it wasn't. uggg. So then I squirted thelovely being with water from the kitchen sink but that didn't do anything either. Then merri's mom left so wehad to watch the assholes and they decided to be obnoxious and annoying. They took a stick from inside the house and tried to hit us withit so then i attempted to grab it from them and banged my hip into the wall ow ow ow hugeeee bruise.Then they followed us downstairs and started talking about their imaginary dragon named Leo that was going to eat us. Merri'smom also told them that they had to stay outside while she was gone so we were getting pretty pissed that they didn't listen. Then we locked them out of the house and went downstairs to play a game. They started ringing the doorbell 500000 times driving the dog insane and banging on the windows. So we'replaying the game sayingkay they will eventually stop and instead after a while we hear more pounding on windows and then a very loud crash. I screamed oh fuck and we looked at the window and it was smashed. Eric decided to geniously hit the window with a baseball bat to get our attention.Then he ran home. Joey was really upset and kept saying sorry a million times even though it wasn't all his fault and merrisaid she would tell their dad and take the blame for the whole thing. I told her she should tell her mom the truth though so then she did when she got home and her mom said she didn't want her taking the blame for it. So now everyone is hoping that the father doesn't see the windowfor about another week or joey won't get a birthday party and the block party on saturday will be cancelled. uggness what a productive day. Joey breaks things all the time with his friends and his parents are getting really pissed off about it. He needs to be more careful. His friends also need to not think about my boobs and call me ahooker haha. I normally love little kids but i seriously think after this experience if i have a son who isso bad that he doesn't know baseball batssmash windows and screams aboutvaginas to the neighborhoodi will kill myself.
