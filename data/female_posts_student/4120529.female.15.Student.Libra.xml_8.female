This is reality and I can't run away from that...It made me shudder in shame...It's not that I'm not being thankful for what I have ..But wouldn't it be better if I am abit more slimmer and smaller..Bacause of this.. I made drastic measures..Yes I admit I did vomit all my food after I ate em'..I stopped when I vomitted blood one day..It scares the hell out of me..bulimic? I did that also because i was dumped by this guy whom I was truly madly deeply in love with or so I thought...  It's unfortunate that I've inherited voluptous genes. I am happy that I've manage to lose some kilos. My weight was 68kg ..i manage to reduced it to 50kg in sec 4. However I am still not yet satisfied. Parts of the body where i wanna slim on is my arms. I feel that it is big. How i wish I got the time to go to the gym. I'm lucky that i join hockey atleast i am forced to excercise.. but then i'm not that fair as i used to be. *sobx* Shud have used sunblock. Although I'm no longer being teased .. i still feel the need to lose more weight. I  MUST.   Standing beside shasha and iqah is even more worse. Sumx i kept hating myself. Why am i like this? Why am i not like that?  I walk up the stairs .. walk home after school.. skip meals especially rice. Some of u may have noticed that I no longer eat during recess.No food after 8pm for me. If i'm hungry i'll munch on apples. I've heard of the 5day apple detox. Apples for breakfast,lunch and dinner. I do feel that I'm torturing myself. I can't help feeling insecure. Too bad I live in a so-called ''perfect'' world.. where u see skinny models in mag and tv.  Yes i do receive compliments nowadays. Even my childhood friends noticed the change. I will try not to do those stuff again but old habits are hard to die. Popping pills and slimming centres are out of the question. Temptations is another contributing factor. You knw how yummy and delicious food can be. I do feel guilty when i eat in large proportions. Atleast i have the honour of wearing baju kurung/kebaya size S instead of M. Now i need a new wardrobe coz some of the clothes are like too big for me.  Another part of my body which I am trying to learn to be grateful of having a bigger bust than some of my friends. My mum did told me u noe sum people are paying tons of money to increase the bust.. i wonder why.. She said just learn to live with it and take good care of it. ..it's God's creation. ..  Words can't bring me down.. i don't give a shit if anyone pass unkind remarks about my weight.. Hahahaha.. it's only when I see skinny and all so perfect girls..that will bring me down.!   I just wish I could appreciate and love myself more....
