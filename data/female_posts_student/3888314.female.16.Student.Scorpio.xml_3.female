My goodness, she's weird  I can't stand it Seems people can't accept my -just- the way I am Why can't she be normal? Just like us  They have to comment She takes -everything- -so- seriously Can't she take a joke? Of course I can  I'm just me I have my problems Just like you Why can't you just let me be?  No, I'm not 'normal' What is that anyway? I'm mentaly sane Or so I claim  I'm just fine What about you? ((Why cant -you- be like -me-?)) ((Cuz you are you and -not- me))
