I have 48 minutes left of work.  And three mediocre sized m's left.  Whatever shall I do?!?!?!   It's still okay.  I have a green one, an orange one and a blue one.  It's really weird.  They look kind of cool sitting on a sheet of white paper.  Cause, you know, the colors are so bright and the paper is white so...yeah.  Sorry.  I'm just really bored.  I want to nap.   45 minutes to go.   Oh no!!  Something happened to my orange m  I think I ate it.  I'm ashamed now.  Wow, that made a lot of difference.  Now the other two just look blah.  It was the orange one that was making it look cool.  What have I done!   Anyway.   And another one bites, and another one bites, another one bites the dust.  No more blue!   42 minutes left.   I think I need a fashion makeover.  Ooh! ooh!!  I talked to Tammy last night about this, I think my biological clock is broken.  It ticks normally for a while then it just stops.  Then it shakes and ticks once, then shakes some more.  Then it's normal again.  I think I need a penis.  One of my very own.  I will love him and hug him and call him George.  Unless his name isn't George.  And I'm pretty sure I wont love him.  At least not in the brain malfunction-y kind of way.  In more of a physical sense.   33 minutes. I can't wait until I'm famous.  Then I can finally marry Mel Gibson.  And sleep with Johnny Depp.  The Depp.  Them will be the days!!  You know, I never really liked Johnny until I saw Don Juan DeMarco(???) like, 6 months ago.  I still don't know what Robin sees in Tom Cruise.  He's okay.  Nothing special.  I think I'd have to pass up the oppurtunity to sleep with him.  *whispers* he's short.  But James Marsters, you know even if he was 5'5 I'd find a way.  I love him.  Not as much as I love Mel Gibson, but it's love all the same.  I don't love Johnny.  I just like him a lot.  I could miss a movie he was in.  But not Mel or James. 23 minutes. I'm still sleepy.  The phones have stopped ringing.  Nevermind. This really happened today, I thought it was humorous.  I kept it to myself though.  Until now. (slightly one sided.) Me - SC Johnson this is Thalia. Him - murr murr murr. Me - I'm sorry??? Him - murr murr murr. Me - Um...Escort Services? Him - Yes. Me - I... don't... understand. Him - murr murr murr. murr murr. murr. murr murr murr. Me - Ohhhhh! Export Services!! Ha. Him - (dead silence) Me - Sorry. (click)   11 minutes left and now I'm done.
