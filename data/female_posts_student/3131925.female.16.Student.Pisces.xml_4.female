Maybe Carlye would still be living here and we wouldn't be doing the stuff we do for fun when she comes down to visit. First day of spring break Jessie decided to have the gang stay the night at her house but unfortunatley Clint couldn't come cause he was on this camping thing. Samantha ended up coming and she brought along Finus. It's still hard to believe that one of my best friends has become this whole other person, and pregnant at 15. We all decided to go to the corner store and get some vodka then head over to the beach. Along the way Doofy tagged along with us and we all just sat down and started passing the vodka around. I planned on drinking but once I saw Carlye and Marie drink and saw Allen and Jessie leave, I figured I'd be the one to drag their asses back to Jessie's. Marie and Brandon ended up walking back to Jessie's and Carlye and Doofy lagged behind us for awhile and then they were gone. When we finally got to Jessie's everyone was just chillin watchin a movie. At 2 we all got tired or passed out (whoever drank). Jessie and I stayed up a little later talking about everything that was on our minds while hearing Marie snore lol passed out up against the closet door on the floor. Later on we heard pounding on the door and it was Carlye trying to sneak back in, then we all passed out again. We woke up really early and decided to go over to the Jetty Surf to get some food, then I got bored and decided to leave. Wasn't one of those wild nights but it was definetly a different one.
