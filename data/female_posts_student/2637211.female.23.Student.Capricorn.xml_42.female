The third member of our group is really stressing me out. Of course, she's sick all week, and of course, she's busy all day today... this whole experience is really making me HATE group projects. When and if I am ever an educator, I will never assign group projects. They just drag the everyone down. And of course, her whole excuse is that she didn't think we'd "want to be around a huge walking germ." I would assume that being ill doesn't fully preclude one from emailing! Please. Really.
