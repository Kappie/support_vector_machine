You get less privacy and are observed when you go out in public on cameras. You could be in a videotape that can be watched without knowing it.  2. Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair? I guess it is fair to have cameras installed in shops, public transportation, hotels and in other public areas so that police can catch criminals and help keep people safe. It isn't fair to have camera's in people's houses and private property without thier consent or places like bathrooms and changing rooms.  3. What is your opinion on this subject? I don't really care if there are cameras in shops, public areas ect, because its called PUBLIC. As in people see you anyways and there is nothing you can do about it even if there aren't cameras. You don't get privacy in public places because if you did, it wouldn't be public anyways.  4. If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats? I don't feel this is an invasion of privacy, but am I supposed to pretend I do for this question? Ok. In that case, governments should put police in place of the cameras, who can watch and can take care of things. Other obvious things for protection without cameras: Don't trust anyone who supports terrorist groups and don't let people carrying bombs into stores.                               THE END
