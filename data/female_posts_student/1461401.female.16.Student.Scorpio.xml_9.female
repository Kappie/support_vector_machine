Seeing them play together is sooo cute, but still, I'm so tired right now. I think I'm going to go see The Matrix tonight...but I'm not really sure... we'll just have to see how that goes. I'll work on my stupid project tomorrow. Stupid project. grrrr Oh well It happens and it will happen just like it did last time ~Kristin (I miss ben!!!)
