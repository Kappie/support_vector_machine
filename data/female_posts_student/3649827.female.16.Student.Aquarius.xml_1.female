Music:  Talking Shit About A Pretty Sunset - Modest Mouse   and i claim i'm not excited with my life anymore so i blame this town this job these friends, the truth is it's myself.   how's that for setting the mood? i'm ready for home. and i feel alone. there's this weird alienation feel that i get most of the time here. i miss the utopian blissfulness of the weekend. and i'm now back here to horrid labs and indian accents. they(the ppl) are all nice. though i don't know if they genuinely like me. i never know if any one genuinely likes me...whatever.  and i never know if they understand me. sometimes i'll do anything just to talk. about nothing if necessary. at least it would be something to do. and when i do talk i don't know if they understand half the stuff i say. they just look at me and smile and nod there heads. and laugh if i say something that sounds remotely funny. what can i do? i feel so trapped here. but i don't know how much better home would be.  i would feel trapped there to. and feel far way from everything and everyone. and all that bother's me will build up inside, until i can't hold it in any longer. and i will succumb to it and be defeated.  and if i ask myself what is truely bothering me. i could probably give the answer. it's a petty matter. but it just sets off everything else. i wonder if there's anything else left for me to do...i hope it rains tongiht. i hope it's dark. i hope it saddens the hearts of those undeservant. while it cheers mine.  if nothing else, at least the weather will relate to me.  i'm losing this mood too...my thought process is shutting off. i blame the uneventfulness of my surroundings.
