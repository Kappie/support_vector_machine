Not back. Not up, nor down. Isn't it really just an illusion of progress?  Who invented this rubbish? Why do so many of us flock to gyms to run on machines that take us bloody nowhere? I find this all very frustrating and humiliating.  Until the endorphines kick in. And then, I feel pretty darn great.   This afternoon while I was running away, without running away at all, it struck me that I couldn't possibly be the only one who had such thoughts. And then I remembered  urlLink Chuck Palahniuk's  novel, "Survivor." Of course who better to say what my tired limbs and oxygen-free brain can currently not say for itself.    After just the first fifty flights of stairs, my breath won't stay inside me long enough to do any good. My feet fly out behind me. My heart is jumping against the ribs it's behind inside my chest. The insides of my mouth and tongue are thick and stuck together with dried-up spit. Where I'm at is one of those stair climbing machines the agent has installed. ... Around the sixtieth floor, sweat is stretching my shirt down to my knees. The lining of my lungs feels the way a ladder looks in nylon stockings, stretched, snagged, a tear. In my lungs. A rupture. The way a tire looks before a blowout, that's how my lungs feel. The way it smells when your electric heater or hair dryer burns off a layer of dust, that's how hot my ears feel."   Welcome to my hell.   On a side note, tomorrow I will implement a new forum to this here blog. It will become a weekly thing. I don't want to ruin the surprise, so I won't tell you what it is, but I'm betting you will be pleased. And if not, well then, you don't belong here anyway.  Adios amigos.
