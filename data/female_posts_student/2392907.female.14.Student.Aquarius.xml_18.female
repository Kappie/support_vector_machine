And hell, Philippa's too.  She watches as James, Nazrene, Charlie, Shivani, Philippa, Matt, and Malpreet climb out of the Jeep.  How the hell did we all fit???   Nazrene doesn't quite make it out of the jeep well though, and trips and falls on her face.  "WOOOOOOOOH! LET'S GO PARTAY!!" scream Shivani and Nazrene simultaneously. (thank you lucy) "I'm just psychic," says Nazrene knowingly to Shivani.  Philippa cuddles up to Matt and Malpreet wanders off somewhere.  "Let's go," says Shivani, literally bouncing.
