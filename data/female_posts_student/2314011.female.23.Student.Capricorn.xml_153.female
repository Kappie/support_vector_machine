The weekend's biggest assignment is finished, just needs to be printed off and that will be that.  Have all day to outline Property, which *shouldn't* take the whole day, like yesterday's little ditty.  The best part about being so busy with so many different things right before a break is discovering six new things waiting behind each task completed.  Because really, it's all about mitigating the damage done to Spring Break.  Sure, next week's assignment is done, but if I can do  more , say, have the first issue for the rough draft written before Friday, that means I'll only have to sacrifice one day out of the four I'll be home to work on the second issue.  So really, even though the productivity is high and the hours long (for a weekend), there nevertheless remains a huge pile of work to be done.    Sigh.  At least my blood's finally replenished itself.  And really, I'm loving every second of the whole damn thing.  Even had my ritualistic Sunday-morning-coffee-web-surfing with the Vagina Mix...kick ass.
