They were like "How the hell did you fit everything in there!?" i was like "excellent...". Neway, after much hassling and bickering we finally were all in the car, ready to fall into the hole, Canberra. After 2 minutes, Mi said "I'm hungry", we all laughed and Mrs. Docker said, "we are in Belrose!" i said, "ah...the twilight zone" (i don't know why i said that).  A while later we were on a main road and there had been a crash, so Peter decided to follow the other cars and go off into a little suburb to try to get to the main road on the other side. All the cars started coming in and this small little neighbourhood had a traffic jam outside there houses. It was soooo funny, all these people were coming out of it's houses, scratching their heads, wondering what was happening. All the lebanese women stood by the street with there head cloth things directing traffic, Beth and I were cracking up. This small suburb named Cheyorall or something, Beth and I had tagged "Lebanon". Here is the dialogue Beth and I remembered later that night.  Driving through the streets of  Lebanon .  Mi and Callum:  (*fart*fart*)  Stop pulling my hair! Michael! I'm hungry. Mum....Callum farted again! Peter: Look, now we're off the main road, a half an hour wait! I'll just drive up onto the sidewalk to get one car ahead... Sue: Don't you dare you impatient man! Caaalm down, just calm down. Beth: Be,  (*clap*)  agressive,  (*clap*)  be, be  (*clap*)  agressive! (cheerleading) Casey:  (*singing*)  We're all going on a  (*clap*)  summer holiday. Everyone:  SHUTUP CASEY!   Another thing Beth and I made up was...(*dadada*)   A Recipe for disaster  Take two physco farting boys, two uncontrollably argumentative parents and one cheerleader, put them into a car for five hours and you have Beth's disfunctional family. Add Casey into the mix, and you have hell!   As you can see, Beth and I had alot of time on our hands.  Once we were well and truly out of Sydney, we decided to stop at Maccas for lunch, where i was surprised to see a Mc Feacies burger was added to the menu. lol, yuk! Another two hours or so and after multiple games of "eye spy with my pussy bleeding eye" (as Mi put it) we finally arrived at our lodge. It was quit nice, except that Beth, Mi, Callum and I were cramped into a small room with bunk beds, it looked like a cabin on a ship. I recieved a text on my phone, when i opened it it said "where are you?" it was from my brother, barnabus. I texted bak and said "in canberra you loser!" he replied by texting back, "home". I had no idea what that meant. But it was so pathetic that he didn't know where i was.  Peter, Mi, Mrs. Docker and Callum all went out so Mi and Callum could train for their cycling comp. So they left Beth and I at home, with only 1 TV station, 2 degree warmth, no food (surviving on gum), we were bored out of our minds, found blood on the floor, were terrified and had no civilation. Finally Beth's phone rang and it turned out being Luke. Ahh...civilisation, or so i thought. Beth was on the phone for 45 min, so not only did i have no civilisation, i had no Beth! Stupi beth! I just sat there. Damn her! Later that night, we all went out for pizza at a nice little Italian restaurant. Beth and I shared a meatlovers pizza. Yum...Just as we were finishing, Mi said "Mum, when are we going back to Australia?". He as deadly serious, it was so cute, we all cracked up laughing. As we were walking back to the car, it was like 0 degrees and we saw a girl wearing a mini skirt! She didn't even have ugg boots on. Physco. When i finally got into bed, i heard Mi snoring like mad! Great. I turned on my side, and got ready for a loooong night. The next day we all went to the war memorial and Parliment house. May i say: boring. It just went on and on and on and on. And on. Later that night we went to Zefferelli's. I had a really nice Chicken Kiev...Yum... For the next two days we all went to watch Mi and Callum's cycling races. They both went really well. I liked being there. I mean, who wouldn't? We were surrounded by half-naked lycra-shorted hot guys. It was so funny on saturday night; Beth and I were sitting on my bed at 10:30, trying to capture the attention of kids that were there on a camp. Evertime someone would pass the small window next to my bed, we would call out, "Hey kids!" hoping they would hear us and come over. When they did come over we were gonna go "apple..." in a really scary voice. Unfortunately you had to be there.  On Sunday night we had a really nice din dins. We got take out from Ali Baba's (lebanese) and took it bak to our lodge. I had a mini Dona Kebab and chips and a coke. Yum...My fave food. This morning i woke up to the sound of the single TV station, WIN. I climbed out of bed excitedly, knowing it was the last day in the hole. This morning is kind of a blur, (i have a bad short term memory) all i know is i am now home and the insurance company has finally coughed up the rest of the dvd's. Excelllent...  LOluv, CM.
