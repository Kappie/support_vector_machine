THe past is just that the past i needed to make a future now.   i must have been driving for hours soon i even forgot what road i was on. It was getting really late and i needed somewhere to stay. I thought to just park my car off the road a little and rest there but i saw what looked like a motel aproach on my righthand side.   It was a rather small motel in comparasin to the ones back home but it should suffice. The large neon sign read "Darkside Inn" under that was a vacacy sign. I noticed serveral cars park and some of the rooms had lights on. It was late at night and i needed a place to stay, looks like this will have to do.   After checking in i took a look around the office a small tv on top of a ragidy stand was placed in the corner and the room smelled of blood oddly. Walking out the place had a very ominus feel to it. Before i enter my room i took notice of a small tavern like bar at the far end of the building.........
