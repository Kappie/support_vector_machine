Last night we tried to get the professor to bag the quizzes, but he said, "I know this sounds parental, but I don't want to require any less of you. I want you to still put your "A" game face on and even though you may hate all this reading and 14 pages of note taking, I hope you'll thank me for making you put this much effort into this class. At least when you go off to practicum and internship you'll remember more than the person who didn't take 14 pages of notes on each chapter". Blah, Blah, Blah. Yeah I thank him. He did give us an option, well not really, it was more so an illusion of an option. He said that if we don't like our quiz grades we can take a final. Thanks. My average on the quizzes thus far is a 90, but after yesterdays quiz, which I'm sure I got a 4, it's gonna go down.   So this weekend I've got probably 12 hours of work to put in. I'm not kidding. I wish I was. Great way to spend the weekend, but I know in the end all this hard work will pay off. I also won't have friends anymore as my social life is disappearing.   To prepare myself, tonight I'm gonna get drunk. So drunk I pass out. No, not really. But I am gonna go to Blue Mesa for happy hour for free quesadillas and then I'm going to Dukes Roadhouse for Texas State happy hour. I've only been once and I feel bad because I've been trying to hang out with my friend Matt who I met there, but it just never works. I forgot about our plans once already and stood him up. I know, it's terrible. Anyway I already know dating a Matt is not good as he is Matt number 14, so I don't feel too bad about it. Plus he's like thirty something.Shouldn't he be married and not galavanting around with a 24 yr old? I think so.  Okay well as I said, I'm exhausted, so I'm gonna go take a nap. Yesterday I tried to take a nap til I got interrupted by a phone call! Aargh!
