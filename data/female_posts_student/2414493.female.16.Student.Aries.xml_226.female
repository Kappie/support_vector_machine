I have heard they sat for hours in briny tubs, patting hotel towels sweetly over shivered skin, smelling the stale harbor of a lost ocean, praying at last for impossible loves, or new skin, or still another child. And since this was the style, I don't suppose they knew what they had lost.  Almost yesterday, pushing West, I lost ten Utah driving minutes, stopped to steal past postcard vendors, crossed the hot slit of macadam to touch the marvelous loosed bobbing of The Salt Lake, to honor and assault it in its proof, to wash away some slight need for Maine's coast. Later the funny salt itched in my pores and stung like bees or sleet. I rinsed it off on Reno and hurried to steal a better proof at tables where I always lost.  Today is made of yesterday, each time I steal toward rites I do not know, waiting for the lost ingredient, as if salt or money or even lust would keep us calm and prove us whole at last.  I love this poem. I found it on the SATII literature test. It's elegant, to say the very least. I just don't know how I did on that test. History curve seems pretty low, which is reassuring. Wendy directed me to a collegeconfidential post, I know I missed some questions and did ok on others. I'm curious for writing and lit. It's not like it was absolutely terrible, the kind of test that gives you that ugly feeling. I spent too much time on the initial part of the lit section and then I realized I was going too slow. Thank goodness I understood the last section, though. Or so I thought. Collegeconfidential is going to keep me amused for days, weeks maybe. I read about the stats of these people and wonder if I'm ever going to make it. I told Andrew I didn't think 1510 was enough on the phone. He hung up soon after, lol. Hi Andrew. I found an Edith Wharton passage on the Lit. I think it was from Ethan Frome. At any rate, I got so excited that I scrawled EDITH WHARTON on the top of the page.  There's this race of student out there who thinks that a 1400 is stellar and all they could ask for. And then there's the type on collegeconfidential who just about assures you that a 1510 is paltry work. I admire the people who can score the 1600 on the first sitting and just get it out of the way. I admire the people who can at least get a 1550. That's good enough for me, seriously. I know you'll laugh, and I'm going to let you laugh away, but those are my standards. So quickly do things change: I thought I was lucky to get that 1510, now I realize it's nothing big. 800M isn't too difficult for most people. I think it's the verbal that does them in. It hurt me.   So I don't know how I did. I think it was ok, but it wasn't like the ease encountered during state testing. Nothing is. We will see. Anything above 750 is done for me. I think I'll have to retake some of them, perhaps. But I have time. I need time.  Bach Regionals today. There is no terror like waiting to play piano. It wasn't flawless, but it didn't fall apart either. I don't know. Do I really care anymore? What is it going to do for me in the long run? I still want it, though. It just means that I'm worth something. There are so many little kids playing now. I think there were probably 5 or so out of nearly 20 who were at least my age. I wonder what I looked like playing piano when I was littler. I no longer see the strong bunch of high schoolers. Well, maybe they weren't in the 3pm program.  So I've delayed studying. I have English to touch up on. I think I'll take practice tests tonight. I better get going on bio, too. That's a scary thought. Ow, that's a loud Goo Goo Dolls song. I ate chili and saltines. I watched Queer Eye. I looked up test answers. I puttered around aimlessly.   Thinking about it, English and Spanish shouldn't be that bad in terms of studying, so I have more time for history and bio. I should go out and get Clif's.   I have an annoying tendency of doing something completely and utterly stupid and looking back later to grasp how idiotic it was. In this case, I just don't want to go back, I'm really happy where I am. He said some things that shocked me, that would have surely melted me six months ago. But I really don't care anymore. That's not so terrible, is it? I've grown up. I really want him to throw away that damn journal. And that's it. It's one of those icky things that I used to do and now I regret, heavily. I don't want to have anything to do with him except to know that we're on civil terms, nothing more.   I can't be tired already.
