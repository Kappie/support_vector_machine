Well, today, I decided to accompany my parents go Sam's Club to go shopping for some odd reason, because that store ususally does not interest me at all.  So I went.  And as we were heading for the checkout, we pass by this display with purses in it.  And it just happens to have a DB bag in it.  So my mom goes and asks the salesman person to take out that bag for her to look at.  (The first bag I showed you, Kailing.)  So he goes under his little counter thing and starts pulling out all these DB bags!  Like, ones that weren't even in the display!  (How, I'd like to know, do you expect to sell bags if no one knows you're selling them?)  So he got out the bucket bag and the one that I liked, and my mom was like, "Look at this one!  It's so much more practical.  You can fit so many more things in it."  And I was thinking, "But it's UUUUGLY."  But then my dad chimes in, so I end up getting that bag anyway.  So then I come home, and I'm like, "I don't want this.  This is freaking ugly."  So now tomorrow they're going to get the bag I really wanted in the first place.  =)  It's $105 at Sam's Club.  Whoo.  Both of them.  The Coach one I showed you was $99 at Costco.  I shall go to Beijing and go to Xiu Shui Jie and get all the fake brand name stuff I can possibly want.  Which means lots and lots of bags.  =)  Today, Jack asked me to go to Six Flags with him before he realized that I was going back to China on Thursday and therefore would be unavailable to do ANYTHING remotely concerning him for a month.  Hehe.  I think our potato salad today was a smashing success!  Now I shall go to sleep so I can be up and ready to play tennis tomorrow at 8.      Ha!  Who am I kidding?  I'm not likely to go to sleep before 1, much less NOW.  Hilarious.
