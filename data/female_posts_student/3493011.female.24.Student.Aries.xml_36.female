I know that it's gonna be damn awesome but well on the other hand, I am willing to serve in the kitchen..I know they needed the extra help... so I manage to go for the nite sessions that were equally great!!!  The first nite session was talking on faith..taking the risk to walk on water and keeping out eyes focus on Jesus... Cos when Peter took his eyes away frm Jesus that was when he started sinking... It's a wake-up call for many even though we'd heard so many times on this epsiode of faith-walking but we seldom realise that when we say "send me, Lord", often do we not tally our request with the faith to step out and focus on Jesus to do amazing things... I am guilty of being one of these people... The first nite there was an altar call and most people was slain and there were prophersies being said... Ps Matt was so annointed... it was life-changing experience for many and some of the non-Chirstians present were so afraid cos it's their first time seeing people speaking in tongues and falling onto the grd...    The second nite was similar and yah I prayed hard for the salvation of my family and the countries that God has placed in my heart... when Ps Matt lay his hands on me, he told me this, "You are a great woman...You have always been hiding in the back row, hiding behind everyone but you have a loving, serving and generously giving heart... You will robbed people the pleasure of knowing your personality...People will not know how much they can get out of you until they finally know you... and the things that you said will add new experiences into their lifes... Stop apologizing for who you are and you are not worthless..." and before I know anything I was on the floor... I was crying out to God... my hurts were revealed so clearly... All these times that I'd give to the people ard me, I juz feel that they may appreciate the work that I'd done and yes I sincerely am touch by their gestures but the truth is that they ain't gonna take time off to sit down and really get personal... I'm so sick and tired of having patronising people ard me..I've decided with this camp that I'm gonna move on... I'm gonna leave OCF and for the next semester, I'll juz spend more time at hme or with Terence or juz in the presence of God...   When Ps Matt was saying those words to me, I was crying so hard cos that was exactly who I was... I'm not an upfront person..I'm willing to do my work without people seeing or knowing...cos I hate being showy or tryin to get that extra praise... I'm also the kind that hates mucking ard and taking extra longer time to finihs of specific tasks esp in a team context... When I see the OCFers, I find that they live in this false sense of innocence and I am afraid for them..well I suppose since most are Malaysians...I think, for them, their life surrounds only church and church friends... or rather Christians...I feel that is kinda shallow to a certain extent yah I know I'm not suppose to judge but I'll rather be honest than a hyprocrite...   I know this is a long post..but I've all these feelings pent up inside my heart for the longest time... I feel sad to leave my "family" and my only friends in Mlebourne but it's time for me to make changes...
