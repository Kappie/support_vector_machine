I figured I'd be bringing in tapes all summer long to prove I really do know how to empathsize with another and I really do know how to differentiate between point and story.  This is all thanks to Amy.  My last tape with her, my professor says, is my best yet.  Maybe it's because I know her so well or maybe it's because we discussed her points beforehand.  Or maybe I am just "that good".  We'll stick with that.    And to further remember this class and my experiences with that, I will forever be on video at the library for others to watch.  Unbeknownst to me, when I volunteered to do a counseling session that was video taped in front of my class, I didn't realize my session was going to be on display for others to watch.  And I wasn't the counselor, I was counseled.  So now everyone will be privy to my drama for years to come.  How nice.  At least I didn't cry.  Feel free to check it out.  Eat some popcorn.
