Also, the reason some ppl cant sing is because they have never had proper training.  I think i sing ok, a lot of ppl say i am a wonderful singer.  I really dont care cause i like to sing and a persons opinion dosnt matter.  Zack hasent heard me sing, and neither has amanda, or any others at school xcept the kids in chior and shannon.  Mwahahahahaha!!!
