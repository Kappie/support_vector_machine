I could never find someone else because i love you tooo much Your the only one that has that i will ever love  I wish I could sit here all night through And tell you all my feelings for you I know in my heart my feelings are true I just wish i had someway to explain them to you  All i can do is hope one day you'll know how i feel I just want you to know that this love is real And never ever doubt  You are that someone that i cannot live without
