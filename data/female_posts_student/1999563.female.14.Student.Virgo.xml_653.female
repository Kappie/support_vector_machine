We arrived in Portland at about 9:50. We hoped out of the car and walked to the river front. There were a TON of people. We found the correct line and stoof there. The line moved soooo slow!!! We finally got into the place about an hour later. I was quite pleased because last time I saw Kerry we didn't even get into line before the gates were closed...  So we stood there and waited. And waited... then a bunch of people came up to speak. First was the mayor. Then a congressman. Then another congressman whose name was Mr. Wu!! [I met him earlier.]   Then came Leonardo Dicaprio. Hahhahah!! He informed us that he was an environmentalist. The crowd cheered. [i love portland.]  After his little schpeel he sat down. Then, up came Mr. Bon Jovi!! I didn't really like him. I like more upbeat music. Maybe he didn't play his bests though.  Then, after he left the stage we stood there. For like a half an hour...until suddenly they played some music, which I dubbed the "Royal Procession Song", and then came Kerrys bus!! It drove right by us then out popped Kerry. He waved, shook hands, and we all cheered, very loud.  Teresa came out and talked for like an hour. We were like GO AWAY!!! because we were all quite hot and all she was talking about was like "woman power" Haha.  At this point I was QUITEEEE hot and dehidrated. I just had to sit down. So that I did.   Then I started to feel like I was going to throw up. So my mom was like "Do you wanna go back to where it is less crowded?" [it was like amosh pit of 20,000+ people!] so I was like "Ok." So I stood up but then I just collapsed. My vision went all black and I couldn't see a thing. I felt like I was going to die. So suddenly, out of nowhere [my mom says it was an angel, that I can beileve] this doctor lady comes and starts to check my pulse. "Call 911!!!! Does anyone have a cellphone?"  So I was like "Great, now I am dying." My mom then poured a bunch of water that this lady [other angel!!] gave us all over me.   The whoel tiem I was like  praying "God don't let me die!!!!!!!"  I really though I was going to die. My mom said I was as white as a sheet and my skin was all cold. When that doctor lady took my hand to check my pulse it felt just like God was holding my hand. It was crazy!!   So they called 911 but decided not to put me in an ambulance until the on site  meds checked me out. Since I could not walk they asked the 911 people to send a strecher. Haha.  So the doctor lady tried to tell them where we were, but since we were surrounded by 20,000+ people they could not find us!  So I drank like 6 bottles of water and I could walk again so my mom and I walked until we found Secret Service Man [it only took like 5 minutes] he escorted us to the medical area and they check my pulse and all. By then I was feeling a bit better so they gave me like 6 more bottles of water [which I drank in like 7 minutes!] they also gave me this cold thing which thay placed on the back of my neck. It felt nice!! Hahaa.   I finally got better enough so I wasn't dieing. But, by then, Kerry was almost done speaking so I missed the whole thing!! Haha. The nice ambulance man got me some posters though. Haha!  It was totally fun though!!!!  Then we walked back to the car [the whole time i still felt like I was dying but I didn't want to tell my mom because she would probably take me to the hospital and that's no fun!!]  My mom took me to Burgerville and let me get all the food I wanted becuase she was like "I thought you were dead and now I have my Laura back!!"  Hahhahaha  Expect pictures in the near future.  I am off to sleep, I must rest my dying soul!! ;)
