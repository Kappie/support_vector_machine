I have to order it and it'll get there on the first of August. Procrastination pwns. So, yeah. All this band camp stuff is gonna start soon... sigh. School's getting closer, too. I don't know... I'm kind of scared. It's not that I'm scared of going to the ninth grade... it's just that all of those goofy 7th graders won't be there... not to mention that So-Young, the spiffiest girl you'll ever meet, won't be with us in our first high school year. Also, I'm not so excited about the marching band. It's gonna be of annoyance to me, instead of me enjoying it. I still don't know why I'm in band if I don't like it. Probably I will... but I doubt it. Eh, too many doubts and worries when school hasn't started. Life rocks.  I'm kind of ashamed... I haven't written to So-Young in a long time. What the heck? I adore her to death, and I don't wanna lose her friendship... even though we're just e-mailing each other. Yeah, but still. She's so awesome you wouldn't believe. Anyone who knows her must agree with this, because you know it's true. Dang, how much I miss her. =\ But anyways, I don't wanna talk about that because it's just way too depressing for me, so I'll stop here. Yeah, I haven't written on a while, and this is a short entry, but what the heck.
