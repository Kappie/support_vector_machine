I used to really crave people, and these days it seems that a day by myself, doing nothing really, is just fine.  I went to sleep really early and dreamed something chaotic, then woke up at 7:30.  I had slept until full, so I got up stretching and thinking.  I worked all day on a story, not really work, but contemplating none the less.  When I create stories they seem to come from somewhere else, really just appear as I write them or think of them, like uncovering a person while they sleep.  There are questions that I ask the story, and it tells me what the answer is.  Sometimes there is not answer, and I know that is not part of the story.  Its just asking the right things, so that the story comes out, like an interview with the spirit that's out there.  It was late one night and I was writing in my journal on our front porch.  My journal is black leather on the outside and white unlined paper on the inside.  I was writing mundane things, just hum drum thoughts on what was going on in my head, in the world, and I was struck by a thought.  What if each thing that we write appears else where- not as in we are creating another reality, which is possible I guess as well, but just appearing on the pages of some book in another place.  There are monks there, I saw, and they are attempting to translate these markings even as they appear in the books before them.  These pages tell, for them, of great and strange things.  They look to these texts for stories of god.  There is a young adept that reads about my dream and sees the story of beginning, and another that reads my emotional ranting and sees the inner workings of the mind.  Their culture is quiet, but there must be a great passion and devotion sitting under it.  The monks wear brown cowls, that are very plain, and a coarse fabric.  They sometimes hum as they work, and rarely sleep.  There are no windows in the study where they are working on my fragmented pack of words.  It is always shadowed, but never cold.  A cave where they are reading things that come from another time and place.  Maybe they are reading the future, or the past.  Maybe they are reading something that will never be encountered in their line of reality.  For me it is strange and wonderful that everything is possible, and that there is no line between real and unreal per say.  It could be that every thought, every dream is real in some place.  This is not a postulation on the possibility- this is the reality that is, because there is no reason it is not.  Think of all the things that people believe in that they never see.  People believe in persons that they have never met, places that they have never been, that things existed that they never experienced.  Is it so far out there that a multitude of other spaces exist that are a part and a piece of our minds?  We live most of our lives from hearsay.  So, lets dictate what the world is.  Not the way is has to be, but the way some part of it somewhere, even outside of this life or place and time, is.  There is a black glass plain.  There are slight hills and the glass is not reflecting any one point of light, because the star that gives this place light is diffused by gases.  There is a space worn rough and slightly deeper then the rest of the sheer glass surface.  There is a girl kneeling in front of this space, bent over like she is attempting to vomit into the basin,  but she is perfectly still.  Wind whips down and carries lung searing black dust, but it does not touch her.  She is pale to the point of being slightly green, and on the black backdrop of this strange world she stands out.  She is staring into a liquid which is clear like water, but moves like quick silver.  There is no sense of depth because the bottom is black.  It could go forever, and it could end in an inch.  There  is no knowing.  She is hunched over this bowl, and there is blood dripping down one of her knees.  It is rolling down and around, and sliding frictionless into the bowl.  It swirls there, like there is some unseen current in the frozen space, and then patterns begin to form.  I do not know what she sees there, or why, that is hers.
