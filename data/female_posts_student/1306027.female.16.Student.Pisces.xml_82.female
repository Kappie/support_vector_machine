I am so overjoyed as you can probably tell... erm..(insert cough here)  So, I thought I would warn the two steady readers of this blog to be prepared- there will be tremendous amounts of complaining on here as soon as tomorrow rolls around. It's not that I hate working, it's just that, I hate working.  Yeah, I'm keeping it short and sweet today.    When all else fails, look to the north and hope that Aragorn comes riding atop that hill to save thy behind.
