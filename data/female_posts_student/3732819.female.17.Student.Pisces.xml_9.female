So apparently my boyfriend thinks that he's worthless, ain't that GRAND?! So because i'm talking to other guys and what not makes him feel worthless, but i never said to him, that did he ever think about how he was making me feel? The fact that i have all these guy friends is cause they make my feel important to them, that out of the blue they would call me or text message me or drive down here to see me for only an hour or so.  At times the way that Brendan makes me feel is that he considering i see this kid once a week and i talk to him once a week doesn't make me feel very good o very important to him. Despite what he may tell me that he misses me and what not...if he misses me does he know i'm only 15 mintues away? or simply just a phone call away? but no...he decideds to tell me when he finally gets to see me. so Whatever! I gave him my blog site cause he wanted to read my thoughts or whatever, so he better not flip out about anything, these are my thoughts that no one can change, when i write in here i'm not going to consider the thouhgts of other people in here...i don't care if i make spelling mistakes or whatever...so piss off... My feelings are still mixed and not sure what the hell i wanna do...i still do like Bren don't get me wrong, but theres all these other emotions that are running through my head.  He also decideds to tell me that he misses my closeness and whatever, aand with him saying that it seems as if he is putting blame onto me, as if i dont' wanna be close with him. If anyone knows me they know that i'm quite an emotional sorta touchy person, and for me not wanting to touch my own bf tells you something. Hearing that he told me that he doesn't trust me is enough. I heard him say enough stuff to me that hurt me and me simply blowing it off i couldn't handle it anymore. Him saying to me that he didn't go for the welsh girls cause i was so much closer to home, and also the first things out of his mouth when i went with his family to pick him up at the airport was "the girls there were so hot!"  and just alot of other things that he knew bothered me. So even at times when he says to me that he thinks about me or whatever, i find that hard to believe, cause if he was thinking about me he would know that certain things hurt me, yet he still goes ahead and does it.  Brendan is a different kind of boyfriend, never have had a bf like him, i'm use to hearing my bfs voice before i go to bed, instead now i hear the voice of one of my sexy friends Cisco with his hot spanish accent. Like he's not obligated to call me, i never even told him to call me at times, yet he still goes ahead and calls me, to ask how my day was, how is everything going, and at timmes even asking what i'm wearing! lol but yeah.  So i guess i'm sorta saying that my own boyfriend is not making me feel very significant.  I told him that i don't know how long its going to take for me to get close to him again, because of all the boyfriends i've had i NEVER had one tell me that they don't trust me. It hurts, it even hurts to talk about it. So yeah, *shurgs* i dunno....mind still thinking, not sure what to do. Still thinking about my dream boy, my "date" with Cisco tomorrow....crap what am i gunna wear?!, uhhhh school, summer school, if my dear Sabz is alright cause she seems a bit down, and i dunno...just shit going through my head, when the hell is Matt coming online?! grrrrr anyways...i'm heading off now. Thinking about more shit in life, and when is everything going to come together?  Ta for now
