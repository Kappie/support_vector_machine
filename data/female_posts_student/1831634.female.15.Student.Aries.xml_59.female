I know what rank louisa and gabriel are now.  =D  so.  still need to know the ppl around me and jack.  do you like this color for the font or the regular old black?  meng told me the blog was too bland, so I tried spicing it up.  with a bland blue.  hahaha.  okay.  I actually went seaching around for templates...  but they all look tacky.  like... ubertacky.  I'm looking for what reminds me of a studio... like... simple but pretty.  with perhaps a few lines of color at top with the font small and spaced.  and that's it.  but there're all these really cluuuuuuttered layouts.  ulch.  wildflower project.  grr.  byebye now.  to get rid of chatterbox or not to get rid of chatterbox...?  -sigh-  ++sunny
