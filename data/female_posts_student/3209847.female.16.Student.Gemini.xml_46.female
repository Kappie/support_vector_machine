I guess its summer and we're both really lazy and don't feel like we have really anything to talk about. Summer has been pretty good for me (well i'll go with OK) and its been OK for Sarah too. It's just kind of bleh.       My last day of work was Friday, June 25. I'll miss being awake in the mornings because I know I'll sleep in now. I haven't been able to do that yet, and I like it. It keeps me awake for awhile. If I sleep in, I feel that I've wasted half the day. Does anyone else feel like that? Probably not, but it might be nice to sleep in for a week.   After that I'm going to Europe.      You know, honestly, I'm really excited about it. The thought of packing and getting organized, taking pictures when I'm there, being with ashley and jenny and katy, sounds very intriguing and exciting. But there's just a constant anxiety of what if I get homesick? What am I going to be able to do about it? And I just love sarah so DAMN MUCH that I don't want to leave her for 16 days! I mean we'll make it of course, but I don't want to be away from her that long, especially because she's still in Texas and not in Chicago yet (well Evanston actually, but that's besides the point).       The point is is that I should be excited about it and already packing now, but i'm not. I know I'll have fun, but I want to be with Sarah so badly. She wants me to have fun , I know that, but I know she'd rather me stay here. I would too if I was her. Not "stay here" persay but never have learned about it in the first place. Italy was hard enough. We're strong though, as a couple. We will make it through. I'll be missing our 7 month anniversary, but that isn't a huge milestone, so that's good. God I just love her so much. She's amazing. I'll have fun. I know I will.      Well what else? I was watching Totally Gay and Totally Gayer on VH1 today. It is so much fun for me to watch shows like that. They're so rare that I need to cherish them while they're on. I think pretty soon Gay will be normal. Of course there will always be people that have problems with it. That's completely normal as well. I don't know. I'm so happy that our generation is more open minded. Open minds make the world go round. We would be dead if even a few people didn't have open minds.       To keep ranting along the same lines of my generation, I am really excited about being juniors. I wonder if my class is united. The senior class of last year was really really REALLY divided. The senior class this year is  pretty  united, but not quite. I don't know. To me, I don't think we are united. That's okay though. I think we're a pretty good class, and I'm glad that I'm in it. We have so many talented people, whether in the arts, academics, or sports. I'm excited about my class schedule this year as well, I hope I get the classes I want.      I want to really focus on AP Chemistry as well too. Honors Chemistry last year was just FASCINATING to me. I don't know WHY I liked it so much, but i did. I really really hope they make that class. But if they don't, i'll take environmental science. I'm taking AP Eng as well and AP Calc. I don't know, to me it sounds like a tough year, but I really want to devote myself to it. I think I can do it. I really want to.      I'm really insecure. I think most of you know that out there. Yeah, you do. If you didn't know, I really don't like myself. I need to get over that too because you need to be comfortable with yourself before you can be comfortable on stage. Fortunately I've had characters in plays that it doesn't really apply. I don't know, being insecure has made me become tense and stressed and always on edge. I'm very anxious all the time. I work myself up too much. Some other people do that too, I know.       Well i am getting tired and so I think I will go to bed. I hope everyone is having a good summer. I love you Sarah. Take care everybody, I'll try to post monday or so because tomorrow I'm going to Oklahoma to deliver my grandpa (Papa) his birthday present. I won't be back until 11:00 or so.   *KISSES* to Sarah!!!
