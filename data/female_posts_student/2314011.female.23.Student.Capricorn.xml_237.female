And so...  "No doubt about it, this will be a hard-work, high-productivity month. While other signs might not be pleased to hear this, you are different.  As usual.   Capricorns are very goal-oriented, and this month you will outdo yourself, driven to near-obsession to get things done to perfection. As a Capricorn, you like to hear that your talents and your time will be put to good use, and certainly this will be the case in June.   The new moon on June 17 will be the month's main event, for from that moment on (for two weeks) an important new project, assignment or account will almost certainly come your way.   In fact, with four planets in Gemini crowded into your solar sixth house at mid-month, it is very possible that this month you will have not one but TWO important projects on your desk, or two clients to see and please. You will be able to juggle all you need to do with rare agility.   We love agility!  Especially the rare kind!!!    You also will be obsessed with organizing things  NO WAY!  - computer files, drawers, closets - and doing so will make your work life much easier. Throwing things out will turn out to be quite therapeutic, making you feel calm and in control.   Just the way I like it.     (respectful snipping of the fitness, weight-loss program)  Romantically, you might be in for a rocky ride this month if you are married or in a close, committed relationship. Before I discuss this, keep in mind that the seventh house (where this aspect will originate) also rules business partners. In what follows, if you have a business partner or collaborator, you might be able to apply this to that person and eliminate the references I make to romance. I am not sure which close partner will be highlighted, but it seems certain one will be.   Well, as long as we have THAT clear.     The first indication of this trend I see is that your partner is about to become much needier at the very time your work will become so busy. Of course, this is not a coincidence. It appears that your partner will feel neglected and it will take all you've got to keep the balls spinning at the office and, at the same time, to soothe your partner and keep your relationship intact.  Thank god I have that rare agility with me!   Saturn is now touring your solar seventh house,  better get that underwear off my table  which often brings about a separation, but it could be one that couldn't be helped. For example, this happens when one person in the pair has to work long hours, study at night, or travel a great deal for work. It looks like this preoccupied person will be you, although I can't be sure of that - it could be your partner.  Stupid partners always mess shit up.     Saturn's position also suggests that this month you may view your partner as too conservative when it comes to taking necessary, calculated risks.  Pussy.     I feel for you, dear Capricorn. It seems obvious you will be pulled in two directions, work and your personal life.  Oh shut up!  It's all your fault, anyway!   There is another way these aspects may assert themselves.  Now you tell me.   You may be in a new relationship, stressed because your work life has become so busy that you simply can't give a new romantic interest the time it takes to cultivate it properly.  Maybe...   You may be worried that things will fizzle before you can get the relationship off the ground.  Mayyybeee.....   In this case, I think you may be worrying needlessly.  Oh fine!   Simply explain to your new partner what's going on. If your new sweetheart doesn't understand, he or she never will. In that case, you need a different type of person. But I don't think that will be the case. Think optimistic thoughts.   Go optimism, woo!   In your horoscope, part of the problem is that Mars has been orbiting close to Saturn since late May. This frustrating aspect can make your feelings fluctuate from hot to cold, sometimes within a single day.  What the fuck is that supposed to mean???   Saturn is your ruler, so clearly, you are emotionally invested in your significant other and would like to give and get support in return. Before that can happen, Mars needs to separate from Saturn. That will happen in the third week of June, when you will see an improvement.   Another equally difficult problem is that Venus will be retrograde until June 29. Venus is the natural ruler of your solar fifth house of true love, and retrograde planets can bring on a change of mind, or some confusion - in this case, in matters of the heart. Luckily, all will straighten out at month's end.   Let's substitute that for  'all will be figured out at month's end' , shall we?    A special day should be Saturday, June 12. The moon will move through Taurus, a great spot for you, and Venus will wink at Neptune, which is as romantic as you can get! This should be a sentimental night, perfect for music, candlelit dinners and going to a very artistic movie together (and talking about it for hours afterwards).    There are several indications that you may travel in June, too, another way to enjoy a little time away from the office.   The weekend of June 26-27 would be ideal for a trip to a nearby town with the one you love (even a friend). Uranus will send the mighty Sun a powerful bolt, and all systems will be go!  I told you, honey!!  We're good to go!!!     If you need to take a business trip, my choice for you would be to schedule a visit to a client or colleague on Friday, June 25. It would also be an ideal day to sign a contract, make a presentation or have an important interview. With Mercury in a sweet angle to Jupiter, this will be everyone's favorite day for very different reasons!"  Favorite days KICK ASS!  Especially the ones we can't put back, gasp!!    And looking over the other pertinent horoscopes (Libra, Scorpio) it appears the Pride weekend and days surrounding it are setting up perfectly for a grand adventure fit for fairy tales...
