I personally would never get a Mac and Berkeley is not a Mac school, so you might want to keep that in mind.  Also, our computer's screens are "wide screen" aspect ratios.  They aren't 4:3 aspect ratios like regular computer monitors are.  So depending on which you'd rather have, keep that in mind but I think they sell the same laptop with the 4:3 aspect ratio if that;s what you want. My computer is really fast, has a lot of memory, and has a very high resolution screen.  If you are going to order off the dell website my dad can probably find you a coupon, like 20% off or something.  If you need help picking one out, my dad can also help because he's researched laptops for like the last year because he got my sister one, my mom one, and then me one.  So yeah.  If you want any other info just talk to me, like lovers do...
