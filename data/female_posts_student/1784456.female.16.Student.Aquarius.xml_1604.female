I hate hospitals, but apparantly the eye hospital has good food! *Yeah right, like that can ever happen!* Oh, Mr Linnet/Linnit/Linnitt is back! *AAAHHH!* He was on paternity leave, which is really cool! Fathers should get time to spend with their new kids! Dad's don't get to see enough of their kids! *Ahh it's a pro-dad thing!* Yes, when I'm older I'm gonna... not be a dad. Sadly, I think at most I'm gonna be a mum *sigh*. Yeesh that was scary to say! Nah, I'm more likely to be a homocidal iliterate maniac! *Yeay!* Aww, and they don't give careers advice on it! (Do I get a CIA record now or later?)
