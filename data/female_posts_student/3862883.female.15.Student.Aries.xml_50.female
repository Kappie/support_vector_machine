At this time in the story we come to a point in which we do not know whether or not we can or can not judge Kurtz. Can Willard judge Kurtz? Well what I have read and the darkness put around these men Willard has a right to judge Kurtz. In the storyKurtz has been in the jungle for some time nowwith cannables and tribes out to kill one another. During this time at some point he had to of known what would of been right or wrong. But then again the darkness in the story can eat your soul and you would belong tothe jungle. So even though Willard may feel he should not judge this man he can. In my mind Willard has a right to judge what he has done and what he will do to him and to the tribes he has put himself up as a God to. In my right mind I do judge him and what he has done to people and I can honostley say that this man is crazy and he will do anything to protect himself and his people.
