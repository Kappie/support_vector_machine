Not even a scratch.   "Marion." A resonant voice came from behind her.   "W-whaa...?" She asked. Confused, she turned.   The man standing behind her looked kindly down on her. Marion felt no breeze, but his hair flickered, beams of sunlight bounced off.   "Marion." He repeated, smiling.   "I-I don't understand. What happened? Where am I? Who are you? Why are you here?" She stammered.   "You always questioned everything. I mean, thats what got you into this mess in the first place. Tittanya tried to kill you, but you're still alive. You challenged death, yet you still breathe. Why ask questions? Why not simply accept things the way they are?"      The dream faded as abruptly as it had come.
