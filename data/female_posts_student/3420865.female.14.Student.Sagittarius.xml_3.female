"tap. thrust. tap tap. thrust."-vanessa, sylvia and i in gym class.(we did some actions to it too. t'was fun.)  "see, this is how grade 7's dance!"-em, as she stands like 2845937 feet away from me, and puts her fingertips on my shoulders, as i put my fingertips on her hips. "and this is how grade 9's dance."-em, as she practically rapes me. i enjoyed it...  "my heart bleeds no more!"-erin, trying to be screamo.  "have you ever heard of alexisonfire?"-me "no, but have you heard of poursomewateronhimthen?"-joby  "i hate laundry... it scares me."-ray  wow. i saw "you know who" today... he was looking pretty fine. but i'm kind of confused, cuz he was wearing a different shirt this afternoon than he was this morning... no, i'm not stalking him. ok yes i am. erin thinks he's tiny and he walks funny... even though the first part isn't really true. neither is the second part though, come to think of it. buuuut... she sucks.  aaah this weekend is still gonna be semi-awesome... minus the fact that i'm not going to the effing concert anymore... *cough*i hate you alex*cough*. buuut erin's coming over on friday night for a sleepover, and i'm getting SO psyched about saturday night! (my part-ay.) it will be coo.  k well i'm gonna go now... paice.  that mistake was gold- i know that without you, it's something that i could never do. kayte.
