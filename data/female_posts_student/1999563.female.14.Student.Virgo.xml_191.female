(He was in the front seat) So he goes "Can I have a chicken strip meal with extra pickles?" and that worker guy goes "We can only give you extra pickles on a burger."  My dad was all like "Please. We really need pickles" The guy goes "Well...if you really need them I guess you could have them" During this whole spectacle my sister and I laughed SOOOO stinkin' hard. We were like dying of laughter. (Can you die from laughing?) It was SOOO much fun. So I got my chicken. And my pickles...  MmmmMmmMmm  Now I am watching a show about CHEESE! *w00t*  I better leave eth the bloggeth.  Love, Laura
