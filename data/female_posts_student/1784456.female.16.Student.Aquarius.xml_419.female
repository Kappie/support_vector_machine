My cats got a bird, it's not dead, it's in our garage but we phoned the RSPCA and they said they didn't have enough room and they think we should take it to our vet for the 'kindest option' (to be put down) my dad's getting really protective though and he was saying that we could look after it, but the RSPCA don't suggest that because then it becomes tame and also it needs to be fed every two hours. Herum. How small our problems are compared to that of the world. Sorry, I just got thinking. Some times we make problems out of nothing, just for the fuss. I guess I realise that and try not to do it. (*yawn*) Hey! This isn't boring this is deep man! (sorry... *smaller yawn*) Yeay, well some one got on this from mine and Izzy's profiles! (Two people did) which is really really scary! Oh, and sorry but I can't be bothered to go on a editing spree who ever you are! (for no reason at all... nope...) Ok, so every one here is depressed I better go! Bubi!
