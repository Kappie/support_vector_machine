I would rather stay and hang out with this "fucking lot" but I can't. Last night was funny and strange.  I had a lot of fun and thanks for not giving me any crap about invading a designated girl area.  I will remember all of the beautiful and slutty outfits WE wore.  Have fun without me. BTW, Val, still stunned by your outfit, gestures, and pictures...  Wow...  That is all I can say...  Wow. :) Later you boogers
