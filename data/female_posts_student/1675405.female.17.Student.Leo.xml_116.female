I wish you all could just fly over here, sit in the backseat, and revel in the uniquity.   Marie, Heather, and I all hung out tonight at the house with my family, and I really had a blast. It's been so long since we've had fun like that, and it was completely called for. Everyone's been so stressed out lately; Marie with John, Heather with college, and me, well, when am I never stressed about something or another? Anyways, it was a really great night over here, and well, I felt energized.  Max is giving me a speech on the difference between showing off your body and being a slut. I hope my comment about Kenny didn't throw her off the brink of insanity. I have gotten so tired about hearing and talking about sex. I'm tired about hearing and getting caught in the middle of lies. And I wish so badly that I could just tell everyone what's happening, but I can't. So I stay dazed. It's probably more of a permanent character attribute by now. But hey, this perfected fake smile comes in handy so much. I don't even know what I'm talking about really; the one thing that I hate about teenagers is the drama of all of the sexual tension. Ugh. I'm giving myself a headache.   Tennis tournament again tomorrow for the, what, third day in a row. And it really bites. Thank goodness I don't have to play until noon, because I can sleep in, play tennis, and have some workable amount of energy on hand by the time I go to work.   Tonight has just not been a Jennica-smile day, and I apologize for the excess of cynicism. I'm giving my self a freaking stomach-ache. I just need to remember to live my own life and to not be affected by others. The same things will be there to bother me wherever I go; it is a shame these are the things that bother me so.
