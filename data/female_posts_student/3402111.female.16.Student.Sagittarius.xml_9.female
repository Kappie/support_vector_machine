One of the workers knows me by name and was kidding with me saying that I was banned and wasn't allowed to come.... lol. "I was lk okay" and he laughed. And the class was huge, and had some funny kids in it. I also talked with Shyam and Lauren there. It is awesome to see friends that I haven't gotten to seemuch thissummer.   And I love my hair cut. It is shorter than i had planned.... but i love it! It is kinda funny b/c I got my hair cut, Craig got his hair cut, and Liz is getting her hair cut tomorrow. I thought that was an interesting coincidence.  And.... hmm, that's about it. Mmmm.... I feel kinda guilty because I missed a tee-shirt meeting and we had to have three sketches done by tomorrow. I hope it is all okay. I will give Stephanie a call tomorrow. Yeah....  Perhaps that is all.... busy solving a mystery.... (that reminds me of Sarah McLauchlan's (sp?) song building a mystery)
