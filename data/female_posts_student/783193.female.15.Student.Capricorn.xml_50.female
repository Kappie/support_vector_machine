I'll try and sum up what's been going on in school and out in a couple of paragraphs, and from there, I'm not sure when I'll be able to update again. Okay, so here we go! First things first, happy birthday to my one and only Janiberry, and I do believe she did have one, thanks to someone special, plus all of us. Aaaand, on the same day, I found out I was getting an A- rather than a B+ in AFS, which was really nice, and it's only going to go up, because of extra credit Ms. Tierney hasn't put in the gradebook yet. Whew. As for my other grades, piece o' cake. I'm continuing to fall asleep in math, which isn't the best thing to do, as I sit dead center in the front, but I have Katie and Grant on either side of me, and Amanda in back to poke me awake. Not to mention Mr. Weston's unwavering gaze. I think he doesn't really mind, though, because I'm not failing or anything. Cross country is ending next week, but we're still continuing winter running, and I think I'll do that. I've got all these nasty things on my feet, and slashes on my right calf from my shoes. Jon Hui has the same shoes as me, and his calves are twice as big, but he didn't get and cuts. Meanwhile, my metabolism has sped straight up, and I'm taking two dumps a day. It's pretty weird. Oh, and I'll tell you a bit about Mt. SAC. We went to LA last weekend for "The biggest invitational in the world", or so the announcer informed us (more than fifteen times) at Mt. San Antonio College. We just happened to go while the Southern California fire was going on, and our hotel was 6 miles away from it. At night, we would poke our heads out the window and watch the hills burning up, and there was all this ash floating around. I took some pictures, but not that many. We watched continuous movies on the bus, and I slept through a couple of them. Our bus driver had major smoking issues, and Brewer got drunk in the little Italian restaurant we ate in. Apparently he does that every year... Then the Renowitzkys almost got in a fight. Thank goodness for Raoul. The hotel was okay, but there was only one elevator. I watched my first episode of ElimiDate, and some other stuff. People were sneaking around the hotel, and all that. I didn't realize how disciplined we were during last year's Disneyland trip until now. The race was hot and dusty, and it was majorly crowded. We placed third for our race, and that's that. A lot of things happened, but those are what stuck in my mind the most.  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/ShareLandingSignin.jsp?Uc=cegxtsb.37rs6zwfUy=-z3rmr4=BrowsePhotos.jsp%3FshowSlide%3DtrueUx=1  I missed homecoming because of Mt. SAC, but I heard it wasn't that much fun. We got third, beating the sophomores, but I mean, they're the sophomores. I don't know how their class can be so unspirited. Okay, moving on. I went to a LEO club event a couple of days ago, and we were helping out with the Proctor Halloween Festival thing, and that was fun. I was helping inside one of those jump-house things, and it's really dark inside, I mean dark enough to not really recognize anyone or discern any features, and this little girl climbs up to where I am, and in an apparent desperation to stay inside, because they get kicked out after like five minutes, she's all, "Wow, you're pretty." And I was laughing inside, because she could have been talking to my foot for all I know. It's not like she could see my face anyway. I was like, "Thanks, you are too." Even though I couldn't see what she looked like at all. Then I told her to slide down and get out. Meanwhile, Jieun, who has a major crush on _ c_ t _ _ _ n _ , was flipping out because he was speaking more to me in the car than her. Heehee, what a silly girl. Sometimes I wonder if he'll figure it out anytime soon. I also have been going to all these Spanish events for my scavenger hunt. I don't really have enough time to talk about that stuff, especially as I've got pictures, so here.  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/ShareLandingSignin.jsp?Uc=cegxtsb.buf84f9bUy=-hesyh6=BrowsePhotos.jsp%3FshowSlide%3DtrueUx=1  Umm... I'm getting loaded down with Kumon and piano theory and struggling to keep up with Mr. Rubin, my violin teacher, while he expects me to practice three hours a day for him. I think I'll manage, though. If I've forgotten something, I don't think it'll ever appear here, so oh well. I'll have more news next time. And I can only hope that it won't be so poorly written, with all these fragments thrown in. Until next time! For old times' sake, Later days.
