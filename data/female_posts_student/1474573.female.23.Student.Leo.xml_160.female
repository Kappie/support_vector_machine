But the sound of a speedbag Speeding up to match The pitch of my heartbeat Don’t speak This is the sound of  Ding ding Ding ding The bell breathes life into me  Fierce eyes  Steel chin There is no mascara No lipstick To hide in   I don’t fight because I want to  But because I need to And sifu When you say I can knock that motherfucker out I believe you   Boom  I get hit And I like it Because it can’t get worse then this Because this is Bills More debt This is a threat to my conscience  This is scores of bad boyfriends Poems that never get written This is my last abortion This is getting cornered And horsewhipped There is no place to go  But up  there are bruises on my back from an accountant that hit me like I was a body bag my shins like like they were fitted with anal beads what fuels me? I am the sound of sneakers Hitting the concrete Feel the pulse of the rope Screaming bloodletting hyms Being a size six Is just not enough motivation To get me to a gym   This is not a poem about wrong doings of  violence this is a poem about boxing more then shadows living in the light this is about learning how to fight for the space that you occupy for knowing that no one can buy what you’ve been born in this is about learning to take a stand for what you believe in this is about knowing that survival means more then living   This is about being who you were meant to be By fighting off who you are About not getting hit in the Face by  Raising the bar  Rooms do spin When the 35 year cleaning lady Lands you a good one In the chin Live in the contradiction Of finding peace Something so violent Nothing’s louder then the silence Skin slapping Sweat dripping Tears dropping Shoulders popping out of place When two heavyweights go at it It’s more graceful then ballet     You don’t know your limits Until they’ve been tested Don’t feel the blood on your hands Breath in the sweat on your chest instead Try to open your eyes When your lids are swollen shut Discern the ringing in your ears From the sound of the bell  Two minutes left  What are you going to do with life You’ve been given   Get up ? Or quit You can’t go any further from here Everything is simple then Beating the crap out of someone 4 times a week your  own personal zen  Because in the ring It doesn’t take much to know Rabbit punch From a slap The harder you hit me The harder I’ll hit back  So I dance  I bob  I weave  And in the real world    I like to think of myself As non-confrontational So to speak But don’t vex me  Because this is why muscular Women are not considered sexy  If you think I’m sounding crass If you think you’re a badass Step up to the mic I’ll push you down Another weight class   You talk about possibilities Like it’s money And you’re broke   You talk about breathing Is like poetry But you choke   You take risks With insurance Your convinced and so sure of yourself You think you can dream yourself awake   Don’t bet  If you can’t pay   Don’t fight  If you’re gonna run away   Don’t act like you believe If you don’t pray  Teaching someone a good lesson Requires either a good poem or one knee to the face   I don’t fight because I want to  But because I need to And sifu When you say I can knock that motherfucker out I believe you   My opponents Metatphors I can’t see through And everything I hold back
