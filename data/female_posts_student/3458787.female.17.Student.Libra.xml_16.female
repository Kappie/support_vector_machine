Days went by, I came down almost everyday. Each day Ishot more holeson this square card. Then somehow the hole became more compact and bigger-interesting I thought. I guess I was not that bad at it after all.   Then suddenly I was a part of this new amazing family. Wow! A hugh one..believe me. We ran 10 rounds around this 400 metre circle every other week together, we lifted this small wheel like things,we perspired and laughed and were "tortured" together.Weshotmore and more holes on cards together as well. There were also times when we had to stare into blank space and think about holes in cards as some form of training. It was all amazing.   Then came a comeptitionto shoot holes and seewho can shoot better holes.We were just great. Oh man.. we can really shoot holes! But of course,in the end some were left really happy whyothers did not do as well but in the end everyone was a winner becausewe are one familyafterall.
