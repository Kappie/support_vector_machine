Start:  so in my dream, i was moving into my dorm at law school and setting up my room. after i was with those final touches of haute decor, i stepped out into the hallway hoping to meet some of my new classmates, and the first person i bump into, the  very first  person, is no other than...the P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. (D.H.!).   for those of you bumpkins unfamiliar to coolspeak, P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. (D.H.!) is an acronym that stands for "Pretty Asian Girl I've Ever Known In Person (Damn Her!)". this P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. that i speak of is someone that i've known since the wee-days of junior high. even through those hormonally-tumultuous years of puberty, miss P.A.G. was stunning as ever, brandishing her beauty in our pimpled faces with her long pantene hair and porcelain skin. the rest of us could only look on in open-metal-mouthed awe. well, open to the extent that our rubber bands allowed.   just in case you think i'm exaggerating, i assure you that this is not the case. Fact: in 2002, P.A.G. won third place in the Miss Korea Pageant. yeah, that's number 3 out of ALL the women in the entire nation of south Koh-Ree-Ah, emigrants included. mm-hm. that oughta put things in perspective.  anyway, the high school years were easy on me, cuz i didn't go to the same school as P.A.G., and even college was okay, when we did go to the same school, because the campus was big enough so that i rarely saw her, and was therefore not constantly reminded of her otherworldy beauty. but law school...well, remember this:  asian women:   49  asian men:     29   so the presence of P.A.G. at  my  law school would be nothing less than catastrophic.  i guess there comes a time in everyone's life when one is confronted by such a menacing threat to one's livelihood that one barely has to time think before the fight-or-flight response kicks in, a biological defense mechanism that gives one an oppportunity to survive beyond the challenge that one is facing. an example would be when one is about to be sprung upon and torn to bloody shreds by a ferocious mountain lion...or when one comes face-to-face with her nemesis in the netherworld of uber-superficiality...  well, the fight-or-flight response manifested itself in my dream by manipulating P.A.G.'s face so that she had sallow skin and undereye bags. it wasn't much, but the minor facial reconstruction allowed me to be happy again, and i even considered allowing her to be my friend.  so in my dream, me and my new best friend, the uglified P.A.G., linked arms and ventured outdoors. we crossed a wide concrete road, easily dodging the sparse traffic, and immediately came upon a bulletin board planted on the precipice of a cliff at the other side of the road. an asian girl was standing before it and stapling some flyers onto the board. she had her back to us, and when i tapped her shoulder, she turned around, and...brace yourselves...it was P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. again! "what da??" you say. "i know!!" i say. it was P.A.G.  double-time : i look to my left, P.A.G. I, the de-prettied version; i look to my right, lo and behold, P.A.G. II,  in her finest form : sparkling smile, twinkling eyes, svelte figure, picture perfect.   this is when i shrieked like a hienna in my sub-sub-conscious. maybe out loud in my sleep.  "hey laura," she says sweetly, innocuously. "i decided to come to cornell law school too."  more shrieking. possibly even some rabid salivating.  "oh, and i'm running for student body spokesmodel. don't forget to vote okay?"  spokesmodel...like a liz hurley for estee lauder...??   "okay, gotta run. let's get lunch together sometime okay??" and just as she finishes her last sentence and steps into the road, a big rig comes roaring towards her outta nowhere. P.A.G. II instinctively draws back just in time to avoid being crushed by the vehicle (fight-or-flight: check), but in doing so, loses her balance and topples backwards (fight-or-flight: n/a)...in slow-mo...over the precipice...off the cliff...disappearing into the dark abyss, forever.  End.   naturally, my first thought upon waking was, "do i need to seek professional help????" i mean, what kinda sicko dreams up a deranged scenario like that?? i dunno. do you?  i recounted this dream to S today, and she brought up an interesting point: if you were P.A.G., how would you feel if you found out that someone had this kind of dream about you? flattered? frightened?  after much deliberation, S and I came to the unanimous verdict that, if we were to be P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. III  IV, we'd be unduly flattered to our wits' end, like, totally.  End II.
