I'm thinking of running for president of the Laotian club (I'm sick of being a secretary that doesn't do anything). Yeah, I'm not Laotian, but quite frankly, I don't give a sheeeeet. No one else wants to step up to the plate. Our current president just graduated and vice president Lily doesn't want to do it. Everyone else is too lazy. I believe our club needs a leader with a sense of humour and brilliant (muaha) ideas. Someone that will take initiative. I see myself there. I will be there. Hmm....Suriyo will be in the club. Brother and sister. How sweet. This is such a bold thing for me to do. Again, I'm the shy one surrounded by...non shy people...and yet the only one that will speak up.  I'm tired of it. I'm moving on.    http://www.seattlefilm.com/film/results.aspx?country=Thailand  Baytong  THAILAND, 2004, 103 minutes  Language: Thai  North American Premiere  An unpredictable and ultimately heartwarming drama with an unlikely comic touch.
