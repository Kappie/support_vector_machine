Last night was the swim party and i got dunked 6 times by 6 different guys! Including Bino! Fun ("F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me N is for anytime and anywhere at all right here in the deep blue sea!!!!") Anyways yea so tomorrow is the last day of summer band and one that i am kinda dreading for those of you who know why! *Deep breath* Not much has happened but i will tell you that i am definately braver than i was last year at this time for certain reasons! I saw the Princess Diaries 2 today it was really good. Like, really good. We had the kidnapping of the littles today so i ate breakfast at McDonalds and then for lunch i had popcorn and grapes and for a snack a bunch of junior mints and i don't really feel like eating dinner (that was for you mickey so that mine is long!!!!!!) And i think thats my life in the past few days. later ppl (everyone says that so i deceided i would to woohoo)!
