Especially guy friends.  And by guy friends, I basically mean Jack, because unless I have worked with a guy on a project with only us two in a group, she does not consider him a friend.  So Kerry would be in this category, too, and everyone else is just... out there.  Anyways.  So every day when I go do something, I have to give her a full report on it when I get back.  And she asks about every single little thing.  It's kind of funny, actually, I suppose.  Even though now she's not so hung up on Kailing and Meng and Jackie.  Because I just go over too often.  But, because she's shifted her attention off of them, she's kind of honed in on Jack.  I feel sorry for him, actually.  Every time he comes over to do something, she asks him about music.  For example: Mom: What do you think of Glenn Gould? Jack: Glenn Gould?  Of course I like him.  He's Canadian. Mom: You like Canadians? Jack: Yes.  I am Canadian. And then they get onto a whole new strange discussion about stuff.  And I'm just sitting at the dinner table eating nonchalantly and trying to will my mom to shut up.  And this happens EVERY SINGLE TIME he eats over.  Which is actually pretty often...  And she's got this strange Chinese mediveal thinking that the guy has to be the person that asks the girl to do anything.  Like for our Hidden Evidence project, she had to ask if it was him that asked me or me that asked him.  And when I told her that it was him that asked me, she went, "Good."  And this time, for the wildflower thing, I just said, "We were just kind of... together."  To which she said, "You're not going out, are you?"  And I just sighed and shook my head.  The wildflower thing WAS kind of strange.  We just somehow got to work together.  Lisa asked me if I was working with Jack in biology one day, and I just nodded my head.  I wasn't even sure if I was working with him yet, but then we started talking about it and I suppose we just kind of assumed we were working together.  I really cannot imagine doing a group project that does NOT have him in it, actually.  And so, there we go.  I just wanted to get that out.  Can you tell by my voice and diction and sentence structure that I'm feeling a bit off?  ++sunny
