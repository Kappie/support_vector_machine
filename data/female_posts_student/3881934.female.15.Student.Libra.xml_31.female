Nice~ Loads more under moi photo album de link nehx.. Mmm.. School todae was rather bored.. Learnt nth basically.. So sad..   Went cwp after sch.. Ate le den peisiling went buy foolscape nehx.. Lolx.. Mi Sam shared a baked rice n a Ham  Mushroom de Pizza~ *Yum Yum* Chatted qt alot over lunch~ abt life in MSL.. Time reali seems to have fly real fast nehx.. How thirteen gt together.. N how e 5 of us have changed over e yrs.. His  Her de relationship.. Wad's so diff btw/n now n presentetc.. This reali makes mi think back how fragile life reali canbe..  Rem whn I was onli P3, I've gt a frnd.. Rather a ex- classmate who met wid an accident at e interchange.. N he died on e spot.. Although I din witness it or wad, but this left deeply in moi mind~ N to think tht he died b4 his hari raya.. Tht's jux too bad..  Often, we tend to take things fer granted.. Not cherishing who  what we have with we.. We onli regret when it's reali too late.. What's e pt of bearing grudges wid each other? Mayb a simple sorrie can simply save a friendship from breaking? No one is perfect.. We have to accept wad's in our frnd~ By giving in to dem.. U're actuali undersstanding dem more.. Wad u feel mite not b wad dey feel.. So, y not clarify things b4 u make any conclusion? A broken glass wil nv b prefect again no matter how hard u try to fix dem back nicely..Cracks wil alwax b dere..
