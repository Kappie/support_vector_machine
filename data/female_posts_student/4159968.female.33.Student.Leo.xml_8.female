So the bedroom is still not finished, the dishes are not done, and the house is still not cleaned.   Have been unable to carry a thought long enough to write lol when I get lazy I get totally and completely lazy =p     In the one burst of energy I found I managed to learn how to finish some slideshows I was working on.  Now I just have to find the music to go with them and program them into the website... lol might be done this week.
