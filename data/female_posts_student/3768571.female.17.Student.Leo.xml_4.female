Well recently that happened to me, and a certain person (let's call her...Mrs G) started being abnormally friendly towards me.   It all started last September, when I started an AS subject, with a certain teacher. It was perfectly clear to everyone that she didn't like me from that very day. For instance, she would request for me to close the door, even if she was closer to it than I was. She'd pick on me in lessons when she knew damn well I wasn't listening at that point. (Ok... my bad)  When it came to essays, when I handed them in, she'd hold it between her fingers grudgingly and skeer at it through a grimace and sneer "it's very short." in a judgemental tone.   What really knocked her out of my boat, though, was when she came to me on the night of my Theatre Studies performance evening (she was "covering" at that point for, let's say... Mrs S, our usual TS teacher, who had been unfortunately ill for a number of weeks). She told me that I hadn't handed in my portfolio to her, and denied all knowledge of ever seeing it. Then after a couple of minutes of me almost having a heart attack and trying desperately to tell her that I did in fact hand it in, she responded "oh... it might be in my office".  Anyway, I suppose it really took off just before an exam, the exam in the subject that said Mrs G taught me, and I was missing something I needed for said exam. However, I didn't go to Mrs G, I went to Mrs S, who so kindly helped me find the item I required. Upon finding out, Mrs G was horrified I didn't go to her first, as my subject teacher, and proceeded to tell Mrs S that she did in fact like me and was upset that I hadn't asked her for it.  (I'd like to point out at this point, if I had gone to Mrs G in that time of need, she would in fact have eaten me, no doubt about it)  Since then, Mrs G has been unbelievably friendly, chatty, just unnervingly lovely. She complimented me by telling me I looked stunning, enquired as to my continuing the subject, let me borrow her CD player, etc. I think perhaps she's trying to lull me into a false sense of security?   Well whatever she's doing, I don't trust her anymore than I'd trust George Bush to do something intelligent, and I dislike her on an equal par with how much I dislike Harry Potter (see previous post). The only thing about her that has changed my opinion of her is that now I see her slyness, and I'm warying of that. Whether she intends to be patronisingly nice, I don't know; and whether she's aware that I will proceed to take considerable advantage of said niceness, I don't know either. What I do know is this: she sure as hell ain't gonna win me over by a few friendly comments and a smile now and again, and if she thinks she can, then she's got another thing coming.   It would seem she's playing mind games... and crossing into my territory with that. "Who's for the game? ...The red crashing game of a fight?"   I am.
