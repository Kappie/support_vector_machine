We have to pick some one from 600-1400, my chick is Christina of Markyate. Her biggest accomplishment was not conforming to society and staying a virgin, we have to go into class dressed and acting like our person. I have to say no to every guy I see, lol... OMFG! it was so funny this is the quote of the week: (I was in Vis. Comm and this really big stoner said this on his heavy metal music taste)    "No I"m not into the dark stuff. I think Satin's a fag" Mabey you had to be there but it was great
