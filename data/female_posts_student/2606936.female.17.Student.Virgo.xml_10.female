Well, the point is my ex-bf's depressed mood actually made me feel better about myself today, but when he perked up, my mood went downhill.  This morning, I was just kinda chattering to someone about band stuff, and the guy he was talking to was like "Hey, Audrey!" as I'm leaving the room. I kinda turned and was like "Hey!" but the Schnig definitely snorted . I dunno if it was a "wow, what a stuck-up bitch" or "she's been ignoring ME, why would she talk to YOU?" snort, but it was definitely a snort. I guess one of us has to be rude in order for the world's energy to be in balance....  But then suddenly after school, he was all happy and stuff. And this shouldn't have any effect on me, but it's like, "Dude, can't he EVER be depressed?" The kid just doesn't care.....  Argh. I mean, it was so nice to see him visibly acknowledging my ignoring him.... and then he went back to NOT showing it!   How is a jerk like me supposed to get any happiness with stony-faced emotional ironmen like that around? My geez.
