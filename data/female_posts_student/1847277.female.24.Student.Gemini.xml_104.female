When I talked to both him and Kurt in the fall they implied it would be all good.  So what is this shit?  And I got up early to be at the osteo lab at 9- we're supposed to have lab at 9, but when I went last week the TA wasn't there so the door was locked.  I asked her about it last week, and she said she would be there from 9-9:30 today so I could get in.  I sat there for 15 minutes, and she didn't show.  So much for that.  Shit.  Now I may have to miss abdominator to go in tonight.
