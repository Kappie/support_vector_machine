I know its gonna hit me later tonight, but thats okay because Jake isn't gonna be here tonight anyways. Im thinking I have a long day ahead of me. Since I'm so awake right now I should be cleaning so that I dont have to worry about it tomorrow...but I'm not about to do that. I might just go ahead and clean up my room and work on some things that I have been putting off when I shouldn't be, because school is about to start and all. Like the T-Shirts I'm supposed to make and haven't had the chance to. Plus I'm not done shopping yet...lol. It actually feels good to be awake early this morning. Im really impressed with this face stuff I've been using. My face is just super soft. I wish I had money...because even though I have a pretty good amount of money on me right now, its not what I need. I need...well actually I want some stuff that I know I'm not gonna get right at the moment. Then I really need to get my hair colored again, but I just don't ever have the time for that either. But I'm happy, because hopefully tomorrow my mom can get off work so that we can spend the day together or go shopping. I like to shop. I hope I get my sandals. I found some that I really really like, but I don't know if I'll get the ones I found that I really really liked. Thats okay though...Im gonna try to ask my mom if she can give me some more money so when I go with Jake and Tracy to Dillards I can get them. Well I've just been sitting here blabbering about nothing like always. So Im gonna go wake up Jake, just cause I can, then I'm gonna start working on some things. Till then, Later Days
