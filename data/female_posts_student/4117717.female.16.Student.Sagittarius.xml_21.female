And five minutes later, another one. It doesnt matter where I am. It always happens.  On other news...  I am completly distracted by the television being on.  Dude, I just had a dizzy moment.  Um, so. I  OH MY GOD! THE LADY GOT OUT OF JAIL! It was just a news blip right there...about the lady from the movie I saw the other day. The one who had sex with a 13 year old. I SAW HER ACTUAL PICTURE! AND HIS PICTURE! The guy said "Whether or not they resume their relationship...she is a registered sex offender." My. God. I can't believe I just saw that. Such a concidence I saw the movie then a 30 second news blip on it. Fasinating. And I'm so going to keep up with this story cause now I am interested. But why, Kate, are you interested in a lady who had sex with a 13 year old??....  Ok sorry I just saw the rest of the story on the lady getting out today. They want to get back together!! It's crazy. Now I am just interested in this story cause of that movie. Damn you Lifetime! Getting me intersted in weird stories!!   Oh and by the way...Fuck Bush.  I just had to get that out.
