This is one of those times where I don't mind being me or where I am right now in my life.  These times are few and far between.  Some of the bad things are kind of being pushed out of my head like the people I thought were friends but really turned out to be complete fakes (I can't stand people like that) it all just made me value my real friends more and want to be a better friend to them.  In this 1st week of summer I have also gotten a chance to spend more time with Alex and Max, I love them so much.  Max has been going to a speech coach cuz he isn't talking yet.  I think it's a bunch of crap, he just doesn't want to talk.  And now everyone's questioning his hearing, too.  They don't understand that he can hear us when we are talking to him he just doesn't care, a lot like me in that way.  I also didn't start talking till I was like 18 months and I didn't turn out that messed up.  You can also look at it this way, the sooner they talk the sooner they talk back.  It's all good =)
