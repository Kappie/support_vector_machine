Brr!, if not. I'll ask you what I needed to latré. And send the Stockwells my regards at the funeral; yeah, they don't know me, but I just feel really bad about the whole deal. I'm sure we all know the pain of losing something to death, it's far unlike other means of loss; it's really a moot point to go over that but it's more of a self-affirmation than anything else.  I am really hurting for rest. So I'll catch the majority of you cool cats laterways.
