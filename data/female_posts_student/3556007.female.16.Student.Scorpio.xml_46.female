Ellen had a bunch of Bailey's, Smirnoff,  whatever so we were just going to have a mini-party. We went to Best Buy and bought Ellen's TV that she has been wanting forever even though her parents said no. Brian was supposed to come and hang out with us, but I didn't call him earlier enough evidentally, so ... he was with Carl. Grrr... Yeah, I know what they were doing which pisses me off so much. But Brian came over with Carl for a bit before he had to go golfing with his dad which was nice of him. Kind of. Cassie and Ellen said that Carl and Brian were being mean which I can kind of see, but I am a bit biased if I do say so myself. Carl really scares me though -- I tried to talk to him a bit, but he just scares me!  After they left we went to Maggie Moos, but I just slept in the back seat of the car most of the time. I was really tired after eating 3 pieces of pizza -- I know it sounds weird, but I was. Also, I was a bit ticked at Brian for having smoked and just wanted to think about it to myself, but I have to get over it... He'll grow out of it eventually. *wishful thinking*  So, we're in Ellen's room watching  Identity , and her parents come home. They were so pissed off that she bought the TV that they kicked me and Cassie out of the house. They are making Ellen return the TV, they threatened to take away her car, and they made her quit her job. Eeek she just called me, and they just returned it. They haven't given her the money for it. Stupid bitch. Its not really her dad just her mom. And even Bryce's mom was like "Why is Ellen's mom being such a bitch?" haha  So me and Cassie went back to Cassie's house and talked to her parents and get her stuff to spend the night at my house. We went to my house, watched the end of Moulin Rouge which is so sad and so romantic. *sigh* Then Cassie had Hercules so we watched that and drank Red Bull... Talk about major hyperness -- so we had a punching match and tried to beat the crap out of eachother. Then we read Cosmo and painted our nails while watching Underworld. I don't know if it was before or after that, but we went outside and just walked around my neighborhood. I talked about Brian and she talked about Michael  Jeremy. Boys. In the cliche words of wise Cassie, "You can't live with them. You can't live without them." ;)  Cassie left early in the morning because she is a bum, but yeah. :) That is about it. Fun, eh?
