Hero, heroine, songs, dance and even the villain. Need money fast. Want to watch the movie all over again. Loved "appadi podu". I have become daring over the last few years... Previously was afraid of going to theatres. feared someone would take notice of my presence Now... fast forward 2004, feel that films are meant to be watched only in theatres and should be watched only in theatres... There's no "kick" in watching films in vcds and stuff A film's grandious stature can only be felt in a cinema or theatre for that very fact... Hey, m not a film distributor or something... Just a opinion! Check out  urlLink Ghillli 's review.
