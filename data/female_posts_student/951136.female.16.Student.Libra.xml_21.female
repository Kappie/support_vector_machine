UUHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! tho not improving my reputation on that bus. ppl always have to take things so damn serious. either way it was quite funny. then lucas came and sat on top of me when i was making my climax sounds. and he joined in the noise making. woah, eric got quite jealous as he wants to be the only guy involved w. me jenn and jessica. and maybe allison, idk if she is in with our 3somes.  so me jenn eric and lucas' moans are now known to the bus. scary stuff. no one on that freakin bus had axe, pathetic, ah well, thats their loss.  and ,me and eric started singing van halen, def leppard, ozzy, and by JESSICAS request nelly. hahaha. imagine jess singing nelly. ya i can't either..  then we all went over to taco bell after the game. eric left like 5 messages on my phone voice mail when i was sitting right there. one was just of him singing all these songs. he's into the temptations. : )  and not a bad voice at all. hes in a band w. his friends. eep got to go!!
