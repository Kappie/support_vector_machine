Spiderman- I would'nt want to have some sticking spider web thing coming out of my wrist. What if I get entangled in it myself? Too risky.  Batman- I would never in any life time want to have two black horn like things sticking out of my head (even though i would definely not mind riding a cool convertable like automobile just like he does :) )  Robin- Who would in the right mind would wnat to play second fiddle to another superhero.  Captain Planet- The same reason why I did not die to join Green Link in NJC hahaha you know what i mean :)   Power Rangers- I don't think its fun fighting Robots  ALL IN ALL i Would rather just be myself!!!! hahaha no Super Heros for me.. what abt you?
