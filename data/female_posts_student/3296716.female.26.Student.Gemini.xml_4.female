I loved it- I loved the thinking behind it.   Basically, Turner and Bruner are saying that there is a difference between reality and experience. That we "experience" reality, but in effect everyone experiences it differently. BUT, they also say that expression- in the form of books, narratives, art, ritual, etc., is someone's account of the experience, and by looking at these expressions, we can have a glimpse of how this person experiences reality. I guess that is what I'm doing with my teachers- I'm having them produce some of these expressions in the form of narratives, to help me understand their experience of being a teacher.    I also pulled a few gems from this:  - Cultural change, cultural continuity, and cultural transmission all occur simultaneously in the experiences and expressions of social life. - The advantage of beginning the study of culture through expressions is that the basic units of analysis are established by the people we study rather than by the anthropologists as alien observer. By focusing on narriatives/dramas/ect. We leave the definition of the unit of investigation up to the people, rather than imposing categories derived from our own ever-shifting theoretical frames. (which is why it is a good idea to let the teachers themselves shape the research)  It left me thinking about experiences, and how much you really can learn from listening to people- from absorbing their expressions.
