Hell, I'm already exploring the psychological approach, why not dabble in astrology as well...  Other than that, not a lot to say. What sparked off my down point was lack of Taylor, again. Not that he wasn't online. Just that he's been too busy/I'm assuming he's too busy to be able to avidly talk to me. Blar.
