Late last week, I became alert to an odd fluctuation in my cycle, and since then, we have been nervously balanced on the edge of unfolding events. To put it simply, my period is late. We can't expect an accurate test until thursday or so.  I start school next week. I had intended to start the pill this month, ensuring that no babies be born until I am safely out of grad school with a secure job. I just dropped a fair bit of money on my diet program, thrilled to have lost 2 pounds in the first week, and daydreaming of regaining my younger figure. I am scheduled to undergo three arduous dental procedures next month, all of which necessitate painkillers that are not recommended for preggos, and none of which may be postponed for 9 months, as half of my bad tooth fell off last night. No way around it, this is a bad time to be pregnant.  Today, Mike accompanied me to the dentist's office for my preliminary examination and cleaning. On the way, we snapped at eachother over which gas pump to pull up to. After several minutes of stony silence, we kissed and squeezed hands, opening a discussion on this stressful situation. I feel like a burden sometimes. If another baby came along, and Mike became distressed and overwhelmed, I would shoulder the blame. My wheels are spinning, I'm scared. Mike is concerned more with the immediate uncertainty of it all, he will most likely feel better when we know for certain one way or the other. After the appointment, we stopped at the mall for an oil change, and the two of us forged into the baby section of Sears (locatedly, oddly enough, next to the auto section) and shopped for the hypothetical baby until we felt giddy with the possibility. Mike held his hands to his chest, cupping an imaginary infant, and said "What if it was a girl?" with a little smile on his lips. We rifled through the pink baby clothes, picking out the least barfy, and left with a little hope in our hearts. I do believe that, when in doubt, it is best to get excited about a possible baby, because I should hate to have my first knowledge of my baby be a time of misery. I want to tell my child with absolute certainty that I jumped for joy when I learned I was having them.  And so we plod on through the week, waiting for a sign.
