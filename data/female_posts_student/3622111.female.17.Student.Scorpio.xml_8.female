While it seems natural to want to take advantage of a bargain, it is illegal to buy these products and the companies who make legal copies are losing millions of dollars in revenues. Write a letter to the editor of the Young Post on this topic, stating how you think people should behave in regard to this matter, and what the authorities should do to combat the situation. Sign your name ‘C. Wong’. Do not use your real name.     Every day, there are many people buying illegal CDs from street hawkers and downloading illegal MP3s from the internet. But these people are seldom charged guilty for this illegal trade. In a result, the legal CD companies are losing millions of dollars in revenue!    The main reason why so many people buy illegal CDs is that these CDs are much cheaper than those legal ones. Downloading MP3s is also popular because it is free! People exchange songs and they can choose the songs they like. This is much cheaper and more convenient than buying the whole CD.    I think this illegal trade is very selfish. A lot of efforts and money are needed to complete a CD. But some people take the advantage of a bargain with the street hawkers and buy these illegal CDs out of greed. There is no difference between stealing and buying illegal CDs because we obtain something which we did not pay for. We loss our dignity when we steal! Despite the seriousness of this crime, the problem of selling and buying illegal CDs keep worsening.    The government has made advertisements on TV and radio which remind the public not to buy illegal CDs from street hawkers. And the companies who make legal CD copies and even the singers themselves have held many campaigns which aim to raise the public awareness of the importance of buying legal CDs and not to waste their efforts. Yet, these methods are not effective enough to combat the worsening situation.    The public is indeed aware of the immorality of buying illegal CDs, but because everyone else is doing that without being caught, there is no reason why they have to spend more money to obtain the legal copies. I think the policeman should carry out more sudden inspection in the trading hot spot. They should not only catch the street hawkers, but also the people who are buying the illegal CDs, so that the public will not easily defy the law thinking that they will not be caught anyway.    For the government, I think it should lay down some stricter laws regarding this crime. It should also consider increasing the punishment for committing this crime. It is important for the public to understand the seriousness of selling and buying illegal CDs. It is the only way to combat this situation. But this problem cannot be solved without the co-operation of the public. So I hope the people will stop purchasing illegal CDs when their conscience calls.     C.Wong      * I don't know if I catch the topic...coz I read the suggested ans...it said the first paragragh of the letter should inform the reader about what the letter's topic is..The next two papragraghs give reasons for buying pirated goods. However the later writing suggested that the popularity of buying pirated goods is to do with capitalism, while the govenrment's laws are there to uphold our society's moral standards. The letter finishes  without  really providin a solution. * ^^"
