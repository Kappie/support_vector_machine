It was gloriously cathartic, and had a happy ending all at the same time.  In fact, some of my friends would come over, and we could rip up *each other's papers*.  Amazing.  Now, I'm sifting through about ten times as many assignments and notes, and rather than ripping up the ones I don't need anymore, I'm selling them.  Not as cathartic, but it works.
