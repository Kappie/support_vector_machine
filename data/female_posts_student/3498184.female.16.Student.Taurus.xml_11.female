Last night Vicki Spent the night, thank gawd we slept in separate rooms. I woke up at 11:30 shaking from being so cold. I was rubbing my skin to warm me up, and it feels like I rubbed all of it off. I got up, went to the bathroom, closed the window, grabbed an extra blanket, and put on my sweatshirt then went to bed. It took me a while to fall back asleep, then at 1:00am I woke up again shaking. I got up, went to the bathroom and searched for some night times medicine. It took a long time to kick in, so I was lying on my air matress in the computer shaking for about an hour before I stopped shaking. Oh, that's when I had to pee again, right when I was trying to get back to sleep. Good times. Vicki woke me up around 9ish, and I got up and checked my temp. It was 104.3. That's good right? lol It's gone up and down all day it's ranged anywhere from 99.9 to 104.5. It's like a rollercoaster, except not the fun kind. Right now my throat hurts worse then it's ever hurt before in my entire life. The medication only lowers my fever, it did nothing for my throat. I haven't eaten anything all day. I can't even get water down. It's either hot or freezing. I hate being sick...
