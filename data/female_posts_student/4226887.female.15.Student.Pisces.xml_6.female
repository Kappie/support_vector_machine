It got me hooked on Hal Sparks as well as Mike Ian Black. Everytime Hal would be on I would comment on how hot I thought he was (I'm a 15 year old girl, what do you expect?). My mom would then sarcastically say "Yeah, I bet he's even hotter when you see him making out with guys on Queer as Folk". Of course in my head I'd be going  I would sure as hell like to see that.       So late one Sunday night I turned to Showtime. It was the season finale. Needless to say after that I was hooked. Luckily, we have InDemand. Unfortunately we have a big lump laying in the living room who never showers that I like to call "Dad". He works midnights so that's his excuse to soil our once clean but always expensive furniture. The entire fourth season is on InDemand so once I coaxed my dad out of the living room I sat my ass down and entered the world that belongs to the fictional characters that are Micheal, Justin, Brian, Emmet and Ted.      Two months later I have watched the entire fourth season and am now what my mom likes to call a "fag hag". I bought the first season on DVD off of ebay. It's weird to watch episodes from the 1st season then watch the 4th season. Sometimes my mom will watch it with me. But not when my dad's around. He says that it's a guy thing to not want to watch a show like that. I understand but for some reason I feel as though he may be slightly threatened by it.      This will sound crazy but I can't help but wish that I could meet someone who looks and acts like Brian Kinney. If only every high school student were as lucky as Justin and have an affair with a man like that. Well, I think I'll end this post right now. I'll probably post again later.
