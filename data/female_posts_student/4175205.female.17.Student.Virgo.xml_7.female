Not that i have alot going on or anything, but sometimes i just need to write how im feeling down. It gets things off my chest.  For those of you who dont know me..keep reading..you'll learn alot eventually Some info to kinda give you an idea of how old i am and all that stuff..   Im a senior in highskool..(WHOO!!) ya im excited. im so anxioius to end highskool bcuz let me tell you, it has been so pointless.  Im 17 today, but in about 25 days I'll be 18!  I live at home still(last yr)  Cody Massey is the most important person to me(i will try not to go on and on about him, but hes just so wonderful..ya hes my bf)   Well thats the important stuff..you will find out much more later.  To everyone that does know me..I will have good days and bad days and i might say stuff i dont always mean. be willing to forgive me because you all know i love u no matter what i say or do.  Basically today i dont have much to say, i just wanted to get the blog up and running. theres gonna be times when i say stupid shit and you may not like what i say but dont leave me comments on what i say.im not writing for you and your approval. sorry if i sound mean, bcuz im really not. i just dont like when ppl give their oppinion when i didnt ask for it..if i ask then feel free to give your input..otherwise..shut the hell up!..haha     alrite..enough for now  and by the way..if you've never heard of butterfly boucher then your really missin out cuz shes aweome..im sure ill be talking about her songs later..  alrite  later
