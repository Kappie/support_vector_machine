Hahhah. It was great fun.  Then at lunch I got CHINESE FOOD! It was soo stinking tasty! My gooooodness. Yum Yum Yum.  I just got back from target. I got this face lotion stuff that also prevents acne...coool. :) Then I got a bunch of socks... nothing special just white ones! A package of yum...and a really cool necklace! Its like a black ribbon witha flower on it.  Tonight I am going to an 8th grade girls sleepover for church. Fun stuff! I don't think I know any eights graders..I get to help and share what I like about the highschool group..and eat marshmallows!   Wahhooo!
