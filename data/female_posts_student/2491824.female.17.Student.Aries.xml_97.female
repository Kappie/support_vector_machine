In 7th period, I had the people that I am directing (Bryan, Leia, and Corbin) read through the scene. I knew there was a lot of sexual innuendo in the scene... But I missed a few things... Especially something in one of Bryan's lines... Here's a snippet of what I am talking about  JOE (Bryan). I heard about that in health class. We had to do a paper on what makes a hormone. NURSE RATCHED (Leia). And what makes a hormone? JOE. I don't know. I got an F. Is that a good grade? NURSE RATCHED. Oh, I like a good F.    tehehe... If you didn't get it, read Bryan's first line aloud... I hope you got the 'F' thing....   Hahahah... Today, Corbin asked me on a date for tomorrow night...  Hahah... Why doesn't he just give up? .... He even said he wasn't going to give up.... I really hope that he loses interest soon... :/
