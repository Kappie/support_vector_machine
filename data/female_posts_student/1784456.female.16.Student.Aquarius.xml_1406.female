No one speaks anything apart from English, our music charts are ridiculed by sad English pop music that you can't even compare to some of the international stuff, and yet we're European. We don't even take the Euro. It is sad! There's all this amazing songs, art and stuff that we don't even bother to look at. *majorly changing the actually good point* I wanna learn Spanish well! :'( Not just so I can sing along to Manu Chao... really... I wanna go on holiday to Spain and not be arrogant to think that they speak English. I don't want to be arrogant or ignorant.
