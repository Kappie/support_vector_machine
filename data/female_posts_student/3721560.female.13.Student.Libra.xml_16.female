I was really hyper this mourning. I had my own ashlee Simpson concert, inm wich I balireds the music for my family to rant an rave at me. yet again I'm not here to please them. Virginia wasn't hyper, which totally threw me off cause in Choir I was funny, and all she would doe was laugh, she never helped me out. Oh well. Im soe tired, and I want my mom to french braid my hair but i higly doubt that is gonna happen. L8er
