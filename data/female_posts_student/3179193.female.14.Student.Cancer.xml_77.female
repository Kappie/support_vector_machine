She walked by and Sally or Tiff or whoever hugged her and I just smiled at her. Haha~ I missed her a lot. Blah. Don't wanna bug her too much so blah. Guess who else I saw? Gummy bear#1  #3~! That's right! Jay and IngiEE~! Muahahaha! Gummy bear trio! We went to English worship as usual and then instead of going to CD Team like usual, Auntie Amy told us to stay and watch Gordon with the drums in Chinese worship. We did and I almost fell asleep in the middle of singing! I DO NOT understand Chinese that well and I can't sing chinese so blah. Sally's skirt ripped near behind her knee so she tied her jean jacket around her waste. Then, she just stayed outside. I wondered what took her so long so I went out for a drink 'cos I was coughing a bit and saw her outside. She told me about her skirt and we went downstairs for a drink. Then, Ingrid and Zoe came out so we all just hung around downstairs. All of a sudden, Erica appeared too so the 5 of us hung out in the basement in one of the rooms after having some Sally Cakes. [Joey Cookie, Tiffany Cracker, Alan Biscuit, Sally Cake, Zoe Tart, and Ingrid Pies] Muahahaha~ Coolness. So yeah... We had a little prayer time together in the room (us 5 girls) and then we gossiped aka "sharing negative opinions about other people" and did our make-up. Haha! Funnyness. While I was waiting for my ride after church, Jay kept poking my cheek and Ingrid's and we just poked him back or something. Haha... Funny dude.  During our talk in the room, all 5 of us thought Wilfred had gotten cold and bitter. He used to be so warm and friendly... My fault? Probably... Iunno... Guys are usually like that after they get dumped... like how Nima was "tasteless" with the whole Sara thing. Blah. So we talked about that for a while and stuff...  After that, I got home and cooked noodles. I missed Nima so I called him and we talked while I cooked. Eww... I might've gotten some oil on my white blouse. Then he had to go because his guitar teacher was there. I ate my noodles, talked to auntie and daddy on the phone, and then went upstairs on the computer. Nima came online after I got off Friendster and we just talked a bit. Not much though. Hmm, come to think of it, he hasn't blogged like he said he would. I'll mention this to him after I'm done.   I missed Nima a lot yesterday... and today too. I wanna see him but can't. :(   Hmm, "MISS YOU" on Winamp... I like "ONE CALL AWAY" though... Blah. Slow mushy "I-MISS-YOU" songs. Haha... I wanna go to Screemers this Halloween with a bunch of my girl friends and hopefully Nima. Girls night out... but I'd want Nima there 'cos I'd miss him too much. Probably go out for breakfast together, go shopping, then Screemers. http://www.screemers.ca/ So yeah. Totally cool.   Nima... I love you.
