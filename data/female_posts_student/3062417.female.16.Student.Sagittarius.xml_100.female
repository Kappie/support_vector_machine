Here are the questions and my answers to them.  1.Close your eyes and put everything out of your mind. you are in a tropical rain forest, there's nobody else around, just you and the forest. describe your thoughts and feelings.  ANSWER:um i wanna see a monkey and i wish i could live somewhere this warm and i wish someone was with me so i wasnt alone. MEANING: that rain forest really represents how you feel when your mind is at peace. So I don't like to be alone. True  2.now, you are in a totally white room. no windows, no doors, no people, just a room with nothing in it...except you. again, describe your thoughts and feelings. ANSWER:i wish i had some paint...blue paint...so i could paint the walls so they arent white and how am i going to get out? and i think im going to go crazy if i have to be in a white room any longer MEANING:the white room. this represents how you interpret death. The blue paint means I wish I could make death more pleasant. True  3. name your favorite body of water and why you like it so much ANSWER:ocean because i like the smell of the salt in the air and i like the sound of the waves and i feel calm and peaceful MEANING:the body of water you chose, an ocean, is how you see your love life. When I'm in love I feel calm and peaceful.  I guess that's pretty much me.
