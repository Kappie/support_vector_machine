Juls you know brett isn't mad at you(and you know why)  I feel sorry for all the peeps in choir, and all of you lets try to have a better week.  THe last few have not been very pleasant, to use a nice word.  good luck everybody, ttyl and ttfn. Oh and still missin those X's( a whole lot) but i think i will be for a while, unfortunately.
