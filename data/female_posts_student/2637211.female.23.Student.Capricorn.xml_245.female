I think I may use them for inspiration if I decide to get a dress made. I'll post my favorite in a bit.  Also, this weekend was a lot of fun--full of beer drinking and meat eating. We went up to the high sierra, and camped right on the shore of a lake. We brought our kayaks, and Dave and Jerm did a lot of fishing, and we ate trout for dinner. Alexa and I took out the boats and sunned ourselves, and also checked out all of the cool islands in the lake. My biceps got a nice workout, and I think I could get into kayaking. It's really satisfying and fun.
