People are overall still heartless and cruel. they would screw you over in a second and obiviously thats how it use to be to, Because they were always killing someone or stealing sometihng or commiting adultry. And so forth. I use to think that the further we got in the world the worse we are i stil do but if i believed in mythology then i would no longer believe that because they were just as bad if not worse then we are now.
