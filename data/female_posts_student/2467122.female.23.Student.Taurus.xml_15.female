Anywho, getting better with a little help from my sister and the boy.  Soup helps take the yuckies away.  Hopefully I will be good for a full day tomorrow.  Hopefully...  In other news- trying to get over my addiction to Trivial Pursuit Pop Culture Edition.  It's the one with the DVD.  How can you not love this game?!  So much for studying tonight.    Trying to get plenty of rest and put the whole RA selection process behind me (I'm all done, it's best not to think about it at this point).  Time for a nice long veg out session in front of the TV.  I love adult swim.  *me*
