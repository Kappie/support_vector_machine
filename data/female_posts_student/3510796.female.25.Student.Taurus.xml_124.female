Well, its like this, when you go to college five years after you graduate high school, and they make you take this  entrance exam , it's possible that you forget some of that stuff that you never really use unless you are a math teacher, which I am not. Last night we had a test, and I was almost done when we heard, "please evacuate to the inner hallway". So we all get up and walk out into the hallway, then realize that the room we're in  IS THE STORM SHELTER.  Walk back into our room and proceed to finish the test, when about twenty people from the hallway come into the room-to seek shelter. Shelter from the bad storm that swept throughthe Michiana areayesterday evening.  urlLink  Like a Mighty Roar     I guess it was a tornado. Anyway, try taking a test when other people are going on about a medical class and two guys in the back talking on their cell phones or a girl sitting next to you who obviously doesnt have anyone at home to tell her that she spilled the entire bottle of perfume on herself before she left her house. =\        I did it though, cause I'm that special. Grey multi-tasks like a  badass.           After class, I had to go rent   urlLink The Bourne Identity  , not only because I want to see the sequel this weekend, but you know, I needed a dose of Matt Damon. I got it, it was nice. Evan heard all about it. Sorry buddy. =)    ------------------------    Word of the Day 7.22.04           eructation \ih-ruhk-TAY-shuhn\, noun:          The act of belching; a belch.
