I was going to come, contrary to what I told Alex, but I fell asleep in front of the TV while Mum was watching  The Bill  and she made me go to bed.  Anyway, Al has put up some  urlLink photos  from his and John's cameras from SUG.  My usual shutterbugness was missing, cause of all the bloddy savage I was playing!
