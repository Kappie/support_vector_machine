So today I stole some Brilliant Brunette Shine Shock crap and maybe it will make my hair cool and shiny or whatever. Luckily tomorrow is my last day shadowing the ophthamologist... I'm getting so tired of sitting there for hours looking at the same pictures of the same eyes in the same book all day. Its good that I'm getting so many hours from this, because it's also pretty tiring. Anyway.  It's silly, but I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction. And its like romantic Harry/Hermione deals because Hermione reminds me of myself and Harry is just hot. Its all so sweet and I wish that I could just jump in and be in one of those stories for a day. I start reading them, and then I talk to Ellen online who has a hot date and I'm jealous of her. I want to go on hot dates... I want to dress up pretty and for guys to ask me out. Normal guys my age, not 30 year olds. I'm falling into that depressed mood again where I daydream. I just... need to snap out of it. And I need to go tanning.
