Yesterday, he was holding my fore fingers in his little fists and he yanked his body in the upright position with a satisfied grunt :) It's cool how these little triumphs seem so huge when they come from a baby.He also talks up a storm now. I can't interpret him completely but I think the gist of it is... "Where's the booby?" Or something on those lines, lol...
