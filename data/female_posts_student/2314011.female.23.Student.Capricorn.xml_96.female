Wish I was ready for a nap, but instead, I'll catch up on reading emails and web surfing before heading home to pay some much needed attention to the rough edges of my apartment and my joints before settling in for the big, gay Oscar gala.  Very excited about that.    It's an odd feeling, really, when the weekend you thought would be a low-to-medium level of intensity turns out to be one of moderate-to-high level.  But accompanying the feeling of pride in accomplishing such a feat is the assurance that you realize you adapted and overcame without even realizing it.  To be sure, you bitched and moaned to yourself as you watched the hours evaporate into darkness of evening, but you never once considered stopping simply because you thought you'd be able to 3 hours ago.    The Spring Mix has played a large role in that process.  And no, I won't post the track list here.  You have to listen to both volumes all the way through before taking a peek at the tracks.  Them's the rules.  But I will say that it is a representation of and anthem for all the events, circumstances, evolutions happening right now.    Can't wait until we're flying down I-5, windows down, skin tanning over toned muscles, watching the skyline emerge from behind the curves, singing at the top of our voices with impossibly huge smiles claiming our faces.
