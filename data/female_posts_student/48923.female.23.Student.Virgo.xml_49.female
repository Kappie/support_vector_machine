(or you could take a store bought ball, but that takes away the thrill of wading up a ball and it is much more expensive than tin foil.)  find the cat  throw the ball  watch as the cat jumps in a gravity defying manner and scampers after the ball  giggle as the cat looks at the ball, and decides he needs to study it from a distant view point  throw the ball again   to add some extra spice, try a fake throw.  my Unnamed cat (whose intelligence isn't as high as we were hoping) will run after the ball that doesn't exist.  he'll leap as the fake ball should be in mid-air above him, as if he would catch it.   he never bothers to  touch  the ball of foil (seeing as it is a lower being than he) but he loves to run after it and flee.  i wonder if he's the type who could never be a mouser, because he'd be terrified of the mouse.
