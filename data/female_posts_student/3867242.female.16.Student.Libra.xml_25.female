It's "Dare you to Move" by Switchfoot. It was in "A Walk to Remember"..I think it's such a pretty song. I love it! I would love it if a guy sang it to me..haha..but that's a whole different story for another time. I also love how Switchfoot is a Christian band..that's always a good thing:) Anyways here are the lyrics....  Welcome to the planet Welcome to existence Everyone's here Everyone's here Everybody's watching you now Everybody waits for you now What happens next? What happens next?  I dare you to move I dare you to move I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor I dare you to move I dare you to move Like today never happened Today never happened before  Welcome to the fallout Welcome to resistance The tension is here The tension is here Between who you are and who you could be Between how it is and how it should be  I dare you to move I dare you to move I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor I dare you to move I dare you to move Like today never happened Today never happened  Maybe redemption has stories to tell Maybe forgiveness is right where you fell Where can you run to escape from yourself? Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go? Salvation is here  I dare you to move  I dare you to move  I dare you to lift yourself  Lift yourself up off the floor  I dare you to move  I dare you to move  Like today never happened  Today never happened  Today never happened  Today never happened before
