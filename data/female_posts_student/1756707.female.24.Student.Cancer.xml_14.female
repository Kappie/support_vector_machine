In a large bowl, stir together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, nutmeg and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Toss cranberries with sugar; add to flour mixture along with orange peel and nuts. Mix lightly.  Beat together cream and egg; slowly pour into dry ingredients, mixing with rubber scraper until dough forms. Knead dough 4 or 5 times, being careful not to over handle. Divide dough in half, and shape each half into a 6 inch circle. Cut each circle into 6 wedges. Place scones on lightly greased baking sheets.  Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  These were hella tasty, even without the nuts.  The dough was lighter and wetter than the  urlLink Cherry Walnut Scones  I made the other week, but they were still tasty and not as dry when baked.
