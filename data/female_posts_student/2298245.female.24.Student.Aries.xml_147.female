       
      Here's a little biblical quote to bring comfort in the New Year, when things tend to be overwhelming, at least for me:  You will be secure, because there is hope;  you will look about you and take your rest in safety. ~ Job 11:18  Today, I'm cleaning and finishing The Goblet of Fire.  Take it easy everyone...things are about to get crazy again soon enough...for some of us, they have already.
