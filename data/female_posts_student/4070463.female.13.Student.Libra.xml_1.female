After the exam, I went to Iffa house to do our project. Atikah, Surati, Iffa and I reach her house at around 10am. Her father, mother, sister and brother were all still sleeping except for her cat; baby. Iffa's cat was so gorgeous. It had white fur. At around 11 plus, Syuhada came to Iffa's house...( She had a parade to march, she is from St.john) We discuss until we were finish but we still got some more time to spare so Atikah found a microphone and started to talk and interview everyone. It was so funny...*LOL*... Oh I forgot to say that I was watching mean girls at Iffa house went we came...It was so interesting....I just wanna say thanks to Iffa for the invation and also to my 4 malay friends foe being my good friends
