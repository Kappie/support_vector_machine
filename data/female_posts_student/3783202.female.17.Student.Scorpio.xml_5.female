Which wasn't always necessarily a bad thing, but most of the time it was because, you know high school girls...they talk. But that's only not even half of my problem. I'm scared of getting too close to people, becuase every time I do, they leave me. And I hate it. Brent and I once again had the trust conversation. And I don't really know if he seems to understand why I don't trust people. I told him that and he's like I'm not people, I'm Brent. I was like umm thanks captain obvious, because I didn't know that. So while I'm talking to him, I'm talking to Danny. And Danny knows all about this because when Danny liked me like 2 years ago, he and i had this conversation all of the time. So he Danny, being the understanding one of the 2 of us, was like you know, you have no reason not to trust him, and it's not that I don't or anything but you can't just expect me to say yes I tust you with everything that I have in 2 months. I trust him for the most part, but I don't know I don't completely. It's not that he's a bad person and lies to me all the time. Because he's not...at all. He's probably one of the best people that I know. He is a really great person. So Danny goes on to tell me that that he thinks Brent likes me and wants to know if I trust him , so that I can date him. That kind of confused me, but then again it made sense, but then again, isn't he dating Stacey? It honestly is so confusing. And then I have to think that there is a slim possibility that Danny could be right, and then by not completely trusting him I could be pushing him away and making him think that I don't like him.  I trust him, I do. And I want to. I trust him more than I trust most people, and in a way that scares me.But part of me doesn't want to trust him, and I don't know why. And that scares me too. Part of me wants to trust him so much that I'm afraid of getting hurt.  I'm afraid that I'll get really close to or something and then he'll be like oh I'm sorry I don't think I like you anymore, and then say that he is dating Stacey. And then I honestly have NO idea what in the hell I would do. I could'nt handle that. I can't handle losing anymore people in my life.  I need to figure out what to do.....
