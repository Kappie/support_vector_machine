Let's analyze this a bit: you've got your All-Canadian, straight-A, sports-lovin', ultimate robo-student and on then, on the flip side, you've got your slacker extradonaire. SERIOUSLY.   What's up with that?   P.S. Matt made me Admin (nah-nah) and so I changed the layout. This is just easier to read. I think. If you hate this, tell me.
