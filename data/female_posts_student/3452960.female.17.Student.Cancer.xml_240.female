It seems to be a habit of mine to use BlogThis!, but I feel it's much more convenient than going ALL the way into the dashboard, then ALL the way to the create posts page.  So what happened during  Industry Day ? We were put "in charge" of setting up some holiday resort in France. We had to manage finances, location, staff, marketing and some other, even MORE boring things. All in all, the day kept me occupied, but it was  dull ...  So what else happened? I went to Ju Jitsu and threw some people around a bit and learnt something that's very confusing. Go me.  What else? Today, I woke up nice and late, because I only have one lesson. Unless you count careers, but I didn't bother going, so I don't. I should probably use all the free time I have to write up my work experience report, but I really, really don't want to. This probably makes me seem very lazy, so I will disprove these false assumptions by saying that I've both hung up washing AND emptied the dishwasher. So there.  On Saturday, Vicky and I are bowling with Dan and Bri. We will beat them because we're really, really good. Professional bowlers envy our elite bowling skills! That could just be a filthy, dirty lie, but we'll try our best!  Hmm. This post isn't quite long enough yet. The Goo Goo Dolls are really very good, I do not enjoy eating fish, British spies did not really have a clue or, too many reliable clues - about Saddam's infamous weapons of mass destruction, raspberry jam is not as good as strawberry, the pope has announced that he is flying to the moon in August, and I have recently acquired a brand new combine harvester, I doubt anybody will mind terribly much if I give you the key, come on everybody, let us have a social gathering and live and work together in some form of perfect harmony.  Thank you, and good night.
