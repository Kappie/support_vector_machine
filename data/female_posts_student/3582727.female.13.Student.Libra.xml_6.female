And now that I have returned, I still do not intend on writing much of anything. Not right now. This is mostly because two of my friends are online right now, so I'm a little distracted from really writing much of anything. But I want to write  something . So here I am.  I think I'll just skip to the current things.  Current... Reading material:  1984  by George Orwell. TV show on:  My So-Called Life . Don't get me wrong, I don't seriously like any show on The N.  Daria 's kinda fun, though. Mood: Kind of blank and empty. But not in a bad way. Attitude toward summer: It's growing kind of boring and repetitive. But it's not as though school isn't always boring and repetitive, so don't get the wrong idea. Thing I want to do right now: Nothing! What's up with that? Things left to write about: None.
