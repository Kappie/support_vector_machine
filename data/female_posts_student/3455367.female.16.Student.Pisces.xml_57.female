Bear (my puppy) is starting to really stink..bad and is still humping things. *shudder* Why are guys so friggin' horny. *sigh* I really should have stolen those boots from the party, I so regret not. Erg that party was crap. Matt from Kempsay is getting SO annoying. =_=; It was so funny when you yelled at him Maya, do you remember..haha, thanks for that. Anywho..long weekend this erm..weekend. I think there might be a movie marathon on, if so I'll go to that. Maybe there is another party on this weekend and we can get tequila again!!! ^^ Tequila is sooo good, I can't believe you don't like it Simona and Shegs!  Weird kids. It was my grandma's birthday today so we had dinner at her house. I was so bored I actually watched Neighbours AND Home and Away!! Help me Beeeenji!!!!!!!  I'm turning into one of them. *glare*  *yawn* I'm tired, must go to bed.  . . .
