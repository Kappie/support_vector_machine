We did that ourselves, out of our own free will.  If you'll remember, Liz and I were originally on Becca's side.    What we need to do is what we planned on Friday.  Have Josh talk to her because he's on best terms with her, and well, nobody in their right mind can get too mad at Josh.  I've tried it, it's pretty impossible.  Then when she comes back in the room, perhaps we can talk it out rationally, but I'm starting to really doubt it.    There is not going to be peace again.  Ever.  But everyone is going to have to deal with the fact that a stalemate basically means that she's out of our little "group" and that we're more of acquaintances than friends.  Not neccessarily enemies, but definitely not friends.  Never again friends, no matter how much wishing.  It would take a change not only of heart, but identity as well, and everyone knows that will never happen.  Rosie, like I said on the phone, this isn't just a mindset.  This is Becca.  This isn't just some cover-up of insecurity.  She TRULY thinks that she's better than us, that we are supposed to worship her, and that her life, her problems, are much more important than everyone else's.  Remember the day Liz told yall her parents were getting divorced, and Becca told her that she didn't care because some distant uncle that I KNOW she's only seen once, like when she was four, was dying?  That was the biggest bunch of BS I've ever seen, but she truly believed that her distant uncle was more important than Liz's parents.  Let me ask you, how many times has that been mentioned ever again?  Oh yeah, never.  Whereas Liz broke down the other day over her parents (not to make you look weak, Liz, but to illustrate my point.)  I'm not saying Becca's problems aren't important, I'm saying that a good friend supports her friends, not try to make her problems look bigger than everyone else's.  And she definitely doesn't yell at someone who is on the verge of tears and antagonize them until they break down.  That is not what a friend does.  A friend hugs and listens, and dispenses tissues.  Do I dare say that Becca has NEVER been our friend?  Yes, I dare.
