I just got a phone call today saying that the scholarship that I had interviewed for has decided that I was the best candidate for the scholarship and that they were going to give me a $1,000 scholarship.  I was so elated to hear the news.  I swear I wanted to cry.  This is a big deal for me because I juggle a lot and most of my most recent accomplishments have more to do with my family than myself.  This is the most encouraging news for me.  I think it is more of a reassurance that I have really found my calling and that I truly know what I want and how to get there.  I want to thank you all for sharing in my joys.  So I did it...I got $1300 in scholarships for next semester...go me.
