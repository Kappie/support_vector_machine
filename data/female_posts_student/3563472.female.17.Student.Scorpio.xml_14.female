I think it is a good idea to do so, it helps you see the world from different eyes.   I have grown particularly fond of the liberal mind of Nicholas Kristof.   Since the Iraq conflict, most of the other columnists have been focusing on the state of Iraq, prison scandals, Bush-Cheney Administration, and now they're moving on to the upcoming election.   Kristof has clearly said what he thinks about the previous topics, but he doesn't dwell on them, however upset they may make him. He travels the world and touches base with many good and bad things he sees.   Cambodia- many girls as young as the age of 9 selling their bodies because their families are too poor to live otherwise.  China- their economy is booming. The government is making a switch from communism to socialism with several branches controlling different areas of china. More freedoms for people to speak out.  Sudan/Chad- Sudan government is performing genocide on native tribes. Refugees run to Chad where food is scarce.  Africa, in general- Africa is in breaking down. There is an obvious AID's problem. More have died here in civil wars since WWII than in all the rest of the world combined. When Imperialistic countries left, no one really helped Africa get back on their feet. Civil wars began to break out between Arabic Muslims and African Muslims. Now, young boys fight for who knows what reason. No one wants to go aid Africa because they don't offer a lot back for help. So, basically any aiding country would be throwing their money down the drain.   Iran- America is viewed as wonderful by the people, not the government.  Mr. Kristof offers his opinions about what we should do or not do for each of the previous scenarios. I'd rather not go into that.  So, there are more issues in the world than Iraq. I don't necessarily agree with everything Mr. Kristof says, but I credit him on being original, honest, pretty fair-minded (at least on the previous issues), and most of the points he makes are pretty good points. If he ran for president, he'd get my vote!
