If we woulda waited much longer, the traffic woulda been hella bad, yeah, hella!  So we got there about 11:30-ish and found this nice little beach. The water was cold and there was no swimming but we laid in the sun abd had sex on the beach (of course!).  Then about two-ish, it was hella busy and we decided we'd had enough, so we left, and since we were already like 1/2 way to 'frisco, we went there.  THe traffic was HELLLA bad tryin to get into san fran.  It took us a 1/2 hour to go 1 1/2 miles.  We were like, "what the f!"  And then once we got in, finding someplace to park was quite an adventure.  Thoes 1 way streets are quite a doozy!  So we finnaly got parked and then we walked around market and such and went into the huge ass Macy's and ate lunch/dinner in the food court.  And then it was about 4, and we went home.  So, yeah, that was it.  Damn you Jason and your lack of sunscreening ability.  That big circle of burn on my back makes me angry!  Grrrrr.
