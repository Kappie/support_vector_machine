I realized that my new template kinda looks like a newspaper. I was just thinking about that. Geez, I'm still tired.  Does anyone else ever feel like you waste time if you take a nap during the day or sleep too long at night? Because I do. Like, I'm just wasting away a day by napping. Maybe if I got adequate sleep every night, that wouldn't be such an issue. I wouldn't have to nap. And I would be able to enjoy my days, rather than sleep them away.  That's probably why I don't take naps in the summer.  Because I couldn't bare to waste such beautiful days. Hell, I never even  sleep  in the summer. Because I don't even feel the need.  Ooh! I just got a good idea. But I can't say. HeHe.  Just saw an ad for Final Destination 2 on AIM. God the first one is so great. I don't see how they can make a successful sequel to it though. Ahh well, all the power to 'em.  Hmm...so long and farewell, dear crazies.
