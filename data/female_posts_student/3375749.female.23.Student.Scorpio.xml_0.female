And that won't be too much longer I tell ya. Anyhow, I guess when I get off work, around 5, Jeff and I are going to go over to Rick and Diems for some BBQ. Diem makes good food too so I'm all about it. Yesterday Jeff and I went over to a party in DeLand that my cousin was having with some of his friends. I wouldn't really call it a party. There were like 10 of them at the most and they were cooking and drinking. You had to sit outside b/c it was cooler outside than it was in their house. No kidding! I couldn't live in a place like that. Their landlord won't install an air conditioner for them. I'd move. I only went to the party b/c Bryan has been inviting me to hang out for a while now, and I'd always have some kind of excuse not too, but this time I had nothing. We stayed for a couple hours. It wasn't too bad. I ended up knowing one of the girls. Her name is Laura Ray but she goes by her middle name now, Lane. Well I'm rambling and I'm going to stop so I can get dressed for work. Yay. I hope everyone has a great Memorial Day!
