Dubbya flew over our heads in his helicopter and I got giddy and sached down the sidewalk like the crazy Republican that I am.  We went to the Lincoln Memorial on, oddly enough, the 137th Anniversary of Lincoln's death and the park ranger was giving a lecture on Lincoln a la Dr. Spitznagel.  Then it was fun with the Metro again.  I swear one of us is going to get arrested before this trip is over.  The presentation went really well, and we seemed to get a good response from our audience.  I'm just glad it's over.  Now I can hang out with my boys and mope about the fact that I have less than 48 hours left in this beautiful city.  I really want to move here as soon as possible.  If any of you DC folks has a couch on which I can crash for a few weeks until I find a job, it would be greatly appreciated.  I seriously don't think I'll make it through the summer without going completely nuts here.  Sigh.  Anyway, tomorrow is more fun with the conference and kiddies...then tomorrow night I get the room to myself.  Yay!  :)
