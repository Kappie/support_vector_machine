It will shine blue and harsh on tiled floors, hanging low in the glassed-over gaps of my ceiling.  Looming greenish yellow, glowing toxic behind clouds and mountains.  Painting gothic panorama's of silver-flecked black clouds against the grey-blue sky.  My rune won't stay put, it faces the harmony keepsake towards me.   It's like there's a message I'm too tired to see.
