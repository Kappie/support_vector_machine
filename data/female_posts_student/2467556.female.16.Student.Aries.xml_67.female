Maybe he'll score a few goals, lol.  Coppell vs. Marcus this week at 8pm, god save us i hope we win.  I'm really worried because 4 of our top players are suspended.  Hopefully some of our top scorers like Josh or Adam will pull us through by just scoring a hell of alot of goals.  come represent, maybe it'll help them win if you come.    11 days until valentines day and for the 5th year in a row, it will suck.  terribly.  i mean, i know i shouldn't care about boyfriends and i don't particularly need one according to a variety of people and i know none of the relationships that get the valentines' day cheer won't last very long.......but i still really wish that i could have a guy and get a little v-day present from him.  meh, better throw those hopes into the closet because its not going to happen.  i'm sure me and britt will hang out, watch hockey and throw candy at the valentines' day commercials on v-day lol.  lalalallalala.....Sarah pointed out to me that its ok because she doesn't have a date either....and then we talked about how this friend of ours kinda rubs it into our faces that "blah blah relationship blah i have one".  oh well, its all good.  Gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
