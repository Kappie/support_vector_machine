I will admit he is a creative writer, but unlike Tarantino, Kaufman can get so wrapped up in his creativity that he loses sight of other important aspects of the movie(ie. emotion, character development). Tarantino knows better than anyone else how to use his creativity to enhance every aspect of a film. That is all I am going to say on the never ending 'Great Kaufman Debate' we have drawn out through two topics now.  I feel you might be being a little generous with saying that 10% of television is the most creative block of all entertainment. Are you telling me that if you went through the TV Guide, one out of every ten shows you would consider interesting. No way, one out of twenty, maybe. So in my opinion it's about 5%, for we cannot forget the trash that haunts the late night and the early morning. But I will agree with you that it is possibly the most creative component that makes up pop-culture.  The few times I have seen  Arrested Development  I have enjoyed it immensely. The dry, witty comedy that is lost on most people, brings me back to the days of  Rushmore  and  The Royal Tenenbaums . Both this show and these two movies are so smart, so complete(greatly written, acted and directed) that it seems like there creators think on a higher plain than all of us commoners. My favorite episode is the one in which they use a flight of stairs as a family car, and Portia De Rossi's character gets stranded in a tree when Jason Batemen steals the flight of stairs from her. Someone who can create this kind of storyline and make it work receives my utmost respect and adoration.   South Park  is the greatest cartoon ever.  Chapelle's Show  is the funniest sketch comedy show that I have ever seen.  Reno 911  is so stupid it shows us how often stupidity and genius walk hand and hand. And  The Daily Show , oh my god, it is the most accurate depiction of what is going on in the world today. But instead of being sad and depressing(like all local and national newscasts),  The Daily Show  is one of the funniest shows on TV. Comedy Central is re-defining TV comedies, it's a breath of fresh air in polluted environment, that's why I would say that right now it is the pinnacle of comedic TV programming.  I believe David Fincher has given us some of the best films of the last ten years.  SE7EN , after a brief opening scene, it immediately cuts to a highly stylized title sequence. An intricate collage of books and photos, scissors and razors, and blood and skin eerily captures the dark, graphic tone of Fincher's intriguing mystery. The film cleverly avoids depicting most acts of violence onscreen, focusing instead on the cryptic remains of the crimes, allowing viewers to investigate along with the detectives. A movie like this is a one of a kind piece of artwork that is often imitated( Taking Lives  is a prime example of this), but this movie has a magic that cannot be copied, It is simply a marvel of modern filmaking.   You are not your job. You are not how much you have in the bank. You are not the contents of your wallet. You are not your khakis. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. What happens first is you can't sleep. What happens then is there's a gun in your mouth. And what happens next is you meet Tyler Durden. Let me tell you about Tyler. He had a plan. In Tyler we trusted. Tyler says the things you own, end up owning you. It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything. Tyler says self-improvement is masturbation. Tyler says self-destruction might be the answer. This is how I chose do describe Fincher's 1999 psychological drama  Fight Club . David once again showed us that he is one of the most cutting edge directors in Hollywood.  Fincher also gave us a vastly underrated film noir crime thriller  The Game . This movie is one of the most brilliantly written, directed, and acted movies that has graced the big screen in some time. Micheal Douglas and Sean Penn are incredible from start to finish. This movie has so many well placed twists and suprising turns, it keeps you guessing until it's unexpected end. So it seems like to me that Fincher's creativity knows few limits, I look forward to seeing what he'll give us next.  Well due to my extremely long Fincher section I will end my post here. I can't wait to see what you have to say about my buddy David.
