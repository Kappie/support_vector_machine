I have won nine items in the past 10 days. It's like a sickness. I can't stop. I keep finding the coolest shit ever.      And now I need a matching contact lens case. Maybe an eyeglass case. And the cosmetics bag...      It's been an interesting day so far. And because I'm bored, I'm gonna describe it in detail. Fun, huh?      It started with waking up bathed in a horrible sweat wondering why the hell it was so damn hot. Come to find out, none of the vents were blowing out any cold air. So I called Lisa in a panic trying to get the maintenance #, and when she didn't call back right away, I looked it up myself (which is probably what I should have done in the first place- oh, well, they don't call it "hindsight" for nothing). Turns out the outside a/c thingy was malfunctioning, probably due to a careless construction worker fucking up something he shouldn't have been fucking with. So Maintenance Dude fixed it and replaced the a/c filter. Now I'm all content (and Lisa, it's only 70 in here, I swear).       I went to Bruno's this morning... well, I tried to. My damn car wouldn't start. The battery is somehow drained. So I called my dad because, hey, that's what I do when something happens to the car, so he can come fix it. Only he didn't  want  to come fix it, and in fact seemed perturbed and maybe even offended that I hadcalled him. Oooookay. So with a bunch of greasy Mexican construction workers looking on, I got back in the car and just kept cranking with the gas pedal to the floor. And after a couple of minutes, the engine caught and I was able to get across the street to the store. Then it cranked fine when I got back in to come home. [BTW, roomie: four packages of Ramen noodles, two cans of REAL Spaghettios, one package of Jell-O brand chocolate pudding, and a pint of cherry vanilla Blue Bell await you when you come home. Never say I don't take care of you. :)]      Anyway, so I noticed that the ducks were under Lisa's window, so I opened it and- thanks to the fact that our pretty new windows do not have screens- I was able to feed the ducks about a half a loaf of bread.It was so funny. I kept pitching it out into the lake and they would swim so fast to get it and their little butts would shake and they'd go diving under the water, and one of them kept cheating and was actually flying over to the bread and pissing off the other ducks. And sometimes, a huge turtle would pop up and beat them to the bread and I could tell they were kind of frustrated by that, too. It was so cute, I spent an hour feeding them. Very calming to watch animals, especially birds. I don't know why. Probably because they're so damn adorable.      Then I decided to go to CVS and pick up a shower curtain liner so I could fix my bathroom again. And again, I had the trouble starting the car, but once I got it cranked it ran fine. But I was in the store longer than I thought I would be (they had Tresemme on sale!), and I had left my windows down, and... dammit, I wish it would stop fucking raining all the damn time. My driver's seat was soaked and when I got home and got out of the car, it looked like I had totally pissed all over myself.       But I did get my bathroom cleaned and fixed, and all seems good with the world now. Another benefit to keeping myself pretty well occupied today? I haven't been noshing. I had Poptarts for breakfast, and I am just now sitting down to hot dogs and cheese for dinner. I love being too busy/preoccupied to eat. That's when I start to lose weight.      I started re-reading  The Search , by Iris Johansen, today. It's one of my favorites of hers. I gave it to Lisa since she finished  The Killing Game  last week. I've been telling her for years that Iris kicks ass. I think she's starting to realize.      Books I am looking forward to this fall:  Blind Alley,  the next book in Iris' Eve Duncan series, which is going to be   excellent   from the plot twist I think is coming (I can't talk about it because Lisa would have my ass),and  Little Earthquakes,  the newest book by Jennifer Weiner, whose books I adore. And I think they both come out the same day, interestingly enough.      I think I'm going to take a nap, and then watch  Some Like it Hot  on TCM tonight. I lurve that movie. :)      Toodles.
