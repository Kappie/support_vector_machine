Then we walked over to blue ribbon and I turned in my pics from over the summer to get developed. Then we walked back, and dad was home, so that was nice. And then tomorrow Amber and I are going to hang out after the football game which I am rreeaallllyy looking forward to. I haven't seen her since august, and I know it hasn't really been that long, it seems like ages. I got some work done on my tome at the library, which is good because I really need to get it finished... now... I think it might actually be due next week, but at least I finally got my second note card check in today. Yes, for now, all is well in the life of me.
