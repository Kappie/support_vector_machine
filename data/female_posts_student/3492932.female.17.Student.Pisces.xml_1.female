Hey this include George Eads and he's not left out! This site's done up pretty well, has the latest info on most of the greatest (looks-wise) actors and bits on their history before they broke out into the world of TV and movies. and not forgetting, into the hearts of screaming girl-fans out there..  And Hey, how could I forget???!!! After many long and agonizing waits, I finally got my hands on the glossy, nevermind thin, illustrated books featuring SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS!! hoorah! But sadly, I'm giving one away to a friend, who's celebrating her birthday next week and a Sponge fanatic herself so that is why one of them books is going to have a new owner.  Alright, it is after all more noble to give than to receive.  Hopefully, she'll squeal her head off and set the story book next to her SPongeBob toy and what other memorabilia.. That's great, I like to make people happy whenever I can.  Makes you feel like the nicest person in the world.  No second thoughts here.  I practically dug out the entire shelf of Nickelodeon books and  my face beamed with pride and happiness after discovering my  treasure.  It's nice to see a familiar, yellow face peeking out  behind Eliza Thornberry and her "off" family.  Now, despite the fact that I spent about 80 bucks altogether on books alone, including "20000 Leagues Under the Sea", which I simply grabbed off the shelf and tucked in between my knees as I did the search for SPongeBob, I realize that buying on impulse can be quite addictive.  Here are the titles, the only ones I found pathetically bound together with a rubber band:  1) Level-2 Halloween Scare (for those below 8, I think) 2) Sponge and princess or something 3) Sponge Bobbini  Fantastic, the birthday girl shall have the newest, shiniest and funniest SpongeBob book as her present.  With that, I hope she's blown away (not by my giving her the best book) by the fact that such a book exists in Malaysia and not mainly in US and Australia and that she's got a perfect bedtime story every night without ever getting tired of it!
