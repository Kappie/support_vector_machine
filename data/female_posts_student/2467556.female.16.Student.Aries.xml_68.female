I am soooo proud of myself!  except i have to do my grammar homework during french because i accidently brought my vocab book home instead.  No big deal, its just subordinate and independent clauses.  Hmmm, i have just discovered that i have absolutely no motivation for school anymore, unless its writing papers for English but other than that, i have no desire to do homework.  Right now, i have to write a paper on how fear destroys civilization and society.....its bound to be fun because i've read books on that.  The only thing i hate about writing papers for english is because they're all like "use/quote textual evidence" and i would much rather just give my opinion and examples.  Oh well.  lalalala....i am soooo bored right now you have no idea.  Super Bowl Sunday.  Oh man, if i could've taped Brittany when New England and Carolina tied......jeez it was funny yet scary at the same time.  Lol, love ya Britt you know i do!  I mean, i've seen her get mad at hockey games but never this pissed off.....especially at stupid football.  Me and Jessica were all freaking out when they tied too....not because we actually cared but because we knew that if they didn't win a) Britt would go into mental breakdown extreme, b) we would all die, c) we would have to hear about it for the next 3 weeks......oh god, there'd be hell to pay.  Thank god for that Patriots kicker dude, he is now officially the saviour of the Super Bowl for the Patriots and Brittany alike.  I mean if they lost or had to go into overtime.....i don't know how much longer we could've made it.  I ate so much food though, i felt sick.  oh yeah! also after the Patriots won the game, we went all around Britt's neighborhood screaming about how New England had won.  It was fun.  Then we went to Tom's house (Jessica's boyfriend) and talked to him for awhile.  I swear that kid.....if Jess won't tell him, i will.....he needs to learn that you (the guy) put your arm around the waist and NOT the shoulder unless you're giving a hug.  And he walked around like that with Jess.  it would've bothered me but maybe it didn't bother her.  I hope he's not reading this....that would really suck.  Sorry Tom! You know i love you and you and Jess are perfect for each other!  Yeah and then when we went back to Tom's house to drop Tom off, we were all kinda standing there in this awkward moment.....and then finally me and Britt got the hint, and left Jess and Tom to each other.  LOL, while me and Britt were walking away, i was like "should we turn around?" and she was like "No!' but then we turned around anyways and we saw them kiss! it was so cute yet so funny!  Jess figured out that we saw them and we had to run for our lives down the street because she didn't want us to turn around lol.  Finally she got over it and we just sang that song that goes like "Jessica and Tom sitting in a tree....K-I-S-S-I-N-G, first comes the dating, then comes the marriage then comes the baby in the baby carriage!.....".  lol, i haven't sung (verb conjugation?)that song in sooo long!  Blonde kid with no fashion sense update: oh man its been so long since me and Lauren have seen him!  ok despite the fact that he wore the ugly jacket and a white shirt etc......he lopped off all his hair!!!  one day he has longish wavy hair and the next day he just cuts it all off and short!  He looks terrible.  I mean, seriously, i weep for him.  Lauren says it looks terrible also.  I hope his hair gets a speedy recovery, lol.  I think he dyes his hair also.  Because he top is really light blonde and towards the bottom, its sorta dirty blonde.  And it doesn't look natural either.    Now its time for the friend story of the week!  Brittany Pleau  Lets see, the first time i ever met her was that one time when i stopped in the hall to talk to Jessica before Masengill's class that tri.  She seemed nice, just like Jessica.  And i wouldn't really talk to her until 3rd tri though.  We ended up having PreAP English 1 and Algebra together.  We would talk alot because we both thought Sam Parnell (the guy on KCBY) was the hottest thing since jelly sandals of the 90's.  And she gave me the website for the brilliant movie making group called the Broken Crayons, in which Sam was their leader.  THEN we discovered that we both like hockey.  and that my friends is what started it all.  We talked so much that we had to be separated.  Even then, we talked about hockey from across the room.  We talked all through English as well as Algebra.  We became pretty good friends.  We went ice skating together this one time, which was pretty awesome except i fell 3 times (once in front of this hockey player! eek! who was really nice about it and said he fell all the time, but it was still embarassing).  Then i spent the night at her house and met her parents, who are super awesome.  Her mom is canadian and her dad is bostonian, which made them really funny.  We spent more and more time together, watching hockey games, talking about hockey, planning weddings to hockey players (lol the just married zamboni!), talking about guys, giving each other advice......generally everything that best friends do!  We have really REALLY funny jokes, but if we told you, we'd probably have to kill you.  Soon i found out that her and Jessica were best friends and in turn Jess became one of my best friends.  We attempted to make a Jackass movie which we never got around to.....but now we've got bigger things to worry about.  She always is there to give me advice on generally everything and sits there and listens to my crazy theories and rants about annoying people.  We sit around and plan who we should sick the Canadian Mafia on (lol!!!) and make every dirty joke possible about hockey.  Brittany's an awesome person and she's hilarious and i love her to death! i know she'll always be one of my really good friends and best hockey buddy ever!!!  rock on Brittany, part of the coppell hockey second season 75!  oh yeah, also when she comes over she always has to leave early to tend to her horse.....but thats cool we love her anyways!  did i mention what she does when Mike Modano gets so much as touched by another player?  she goes into cardiac arrest!! lol, i still love you britt!!!  rick on Canada rick on!!!, tie theory (just made today!), finnish people theory, european theory, hockey player theory, "lets drop the gloves and go barehanded!", "you don't wear clothes to play tennis!", "just do it, Instant message!".....lol and all the great times we've had!  ^^ yay for friend stories  Alright my mom is yelling at me to go clean my room or something along those lines or just get off the comp so i will talk to you all later!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
