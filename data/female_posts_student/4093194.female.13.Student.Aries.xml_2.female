Oh yeah, he also likes to do Motocross or something like that, I couldn't understand what Griffin had said lol. And he also wants to be rich...but really, who doesn't lol. Yeah, he's in my 1st period EXPO class, and my 6th period IPC Science class...it really sux tho cuz I have to get a schedule change to be in choir cuz they messed up my scheldule, and guess what period choir is?!? 6th period, which means my whole schedule will be all switched around, which means no more classes with Andrew : ( WAHHHHHH!!! Oh well, *tear tear* I suppose I can live without the classes lol. I mean, maybe it's time to move on from him. I know it'll never work out, and why torture myself. I know this kid at my church who liked me last year and in 6th grade, I suppose I could talk to him more or something. He comes to church every Sunday and to youth, so it wouldn't be that hard!
