It's just enough to see a shooting star To know you're never really far... It's just enough to see a shooting star To know you're never really gone  Oh, please don't go Let me have you just one moment more Oh, all I need All I want is just one moment more You've got to hold me and maybe I'll believe  -Mindy Smith, "One Moment More"
