"work".  spent first hour eating, then talked, then went to hobby lobby, the tried to print pictures, then started painting at approx. 9pm.  -___-  nice.  and it looks like freaking crap.  and I'm not exaggerating.  our art skills = zip.  and now jack is having troubles burning our movie onto a DVD.  ho hum.  I spent approx. half an hour tonight faxing all my bio notes over to jack b/c he lost all of his.  -____- joy.  then I typed up the master list of archetypes!  which was interesting.  I hope we didn't get any of it wrong...  -___-  more stream of consciousness?  na.  not tonight.  gonna go brush my teeth and sleep now.  =D
