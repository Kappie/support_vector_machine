But I feel as if the math teacher actually understand now though that I really do need help with some things which is good.  And tonight I studied for Chemistry but well I have been reviewing since the weekend so I wouldn't have to cram and well I am kind of putting some pressure on myself to do good because my quiz mark wasn't so hot.  And well I had a better day today - didn't cry but well Chelsey and Monet do like everything together and I think how that once used to be me and she denies that we are going are separate ways sometimes but I think it is true.  But well I think I worry to much about that and tommorow I am going to try to just be happy!
