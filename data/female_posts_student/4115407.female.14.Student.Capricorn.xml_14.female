Most adults say oh please i was 15 once, yea um that was about 40 yrs. ago, i mean society has changed so much, kids and teens have changed. Now we just dont have to worry about maybe just getting hit by a car, we have to worry about rape, drugs, AIDS, STDs and alot more. Adults dont have the slightest idea wut it feels like to be a teen in this society now, they never walked down the street and had grown men yellin at them, i mean grown men give me a break, sum men are just dogs. They have no idea wut it feels like to go to school have have boys just come up and touch and talk to you however they like, ( just from wut i see, cause if they touch me they kno they getting their a** kicked) they never know how it feels to be presseured to have sex, or to take drugs, they dont even know the conversations half of us teen even be talking about. I just hate when adults try to compare their lives and say they know how we feel, because they dont have the slightest idea of wut goes in school, and after school, if they would just take one day in my shoes or any other teen now, they would give us some slack, well my mom probably wouldnt even let me out of the house again lol, but this world is sooo dangerous, i mean now i see why u should wait till have sex until ur married, no i havent done anything, but my friends have made mistakes have gotten theirself into problems, first of all, u cant even find a boy to trust, boys now jus wanna (excuse me language but this is a real quote) "hit it" and go tell their friends. And now girls have to worry about getting pregnant, or catching aids or sum nasty STD..... anyway, its jus my opinion that adults dont have the slighteset idea of wut their talkin about, and i wish they could stop assuming and judging us without even seeing wut we have to go through everyday.
