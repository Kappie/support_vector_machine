One and many have sought after "The Ice Cream Truck Man", because of the sugary goodness of the contents hidden inside his musical truck. Few know that "The Ice Cream Truck Man" is only an illusion, concealing the inflated black market of  flavored, frozen water . Inflated black market or no, the public masses still stream out to the curb every sunny afternoon to meet the "Ice Cream Truck Man" and his musical truck.   The "Ice Cream Truck Man", we shall call him TICTM for short, has not one, but two, secret weapons with which he uses to hypnotize the unsuspecting residents of the neighborhood he may be gracing at that moment. The first secret weapon he has is of course, the musical truck, which can be heard from at least 2 miles away (Maybe 3 if your kid has an intrinsic ability to detect mobile sugar). This truck plays it's sing-songish tune as it slowly moves throughout the city, Promising high prices and the sugary goodness of flavored frozen water. Not many can resist the consuming call of the musical truck. TICTM's second weapon is of course, the hard cold product itself;  the flavored frozen water . "What is so amazing about frozen flavored water"- I dare to ask. "It's yummy stupid!", would be the answer of one of the kids down the block. So, basically, TICTM is music, inflation, and yummy (stupid!) flavored frozen water wrapped all into one mobile black market machine. Understandable.  It was because of this mobile, musical, yummy, inflationist black market truck, that my mother and I went driving all over creation yesterday. It was funny really. We wanted flavored frozen water and we were going to get it! So without further beating of the bush, I will now admit, that I, Meghan, have chased an Ice Cream Truck.   It wasn't all the thrill and excitement that ya'll are probably thinking it was, but, we did get our flavored frozen water!
