Well I am pissed off with the Sixth Form only because that the party they have organised for us is located at a club/bar we aren't even allowed in so that is gay and pointless. Other than that I am still enjoying Sixth Form. I thinks its fab. Over the past week I have lost 3, what I thought were close, friends but I am not too bothered as I have gained loads more and I still of course have you fabulas guys! Oh THAT survey.
