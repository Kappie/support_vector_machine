Mom(aka Pam aka St.joe's Youth Pastor aka Justine's mom), Justine, Carol, Alex, Seth, Emily, some Chris kid I just met, Trevor, Jenna and I all went out to Applebees afterwards to eat(obviously). Gabe kept text messaging me and I was getting a little too giddy and Carol had to tell me to turn my cell phone noise off haha...whoops. Sorry Carol! I also had quite a blonde moment when Seth, who was sitting right next to me, called me and I talked to him..."Who is this?" "Seth" "who?" "SETH" "I dont know any Seths" okay it wasnt that bad but you get the picture. I just found out last night that I get to go on the yearbook retreat for sure!!! I'm really excited! Hopefully Gabe and his friends will go to the "quest"(name of the underage club) with us. He hasn't sent me the pictures yet grrr... Lance also called and I am hanging out with him today! Should be fun...he is my little art friend, we always had good times in art, so I'm sure we will today. My cell phone went off soo many times...normally I get excited but I was almost irritated. Carol compared me to a monkey again because I was climbing over chairs to get out to talk on the phone. Well maybe you look like a monkey too!!! no, carol is goregous and she is my bestest friend, i will post a picture of her later hehe. Anyway, that was my life last night... Yes, Ryan, I am trying to make this blog as boring as possible! HAHAHAHA
