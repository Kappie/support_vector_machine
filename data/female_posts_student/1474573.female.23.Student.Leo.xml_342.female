Basically, I lost my tickets and unless I got there ASAP and waited on a line with the probability that I would not get 3 tickets, but only 2.  I didn't know what to do!  My best friend took a day off of work to go to this thing!!  I was literally having a breakdown.  And it was my own fuckin' fault.  I mean, if I had been paying more attention, I would have gotten this shit over and done with already.  I was  desperate .  I was on the phone for about an hour trying to get someone to help me.  I've come to the realization that my school is not really equipped with many helpful people.  In fact, I was on hold with one person for over 15 minutes because I thought she was going to get the tickets and hold them for me but in actuality, she put me on hold and FORGOT about me.  And then when she came back to the line saying, "Who are you holding for?" and I said, "YOU!" She tried to play dumb.  NO, I take that back...she WAS dumb.  Then I basically hung up on her and called this other area where a nice boy named Gilbert helped me.    Gilbert had become my new best friend.  I openly sobbed on the phone to him.  I told him of my plight and how no one was helping me and that he just HAD to help me.  It was his duty.  He felt my pain and told me to hold on.  I told him not to forget about me like the other mean girl.  He laughed at that.  He came back on the line about 3 minutes later saying that he could hold 3 tickets for me because he knows the guy that's running the show.  I gave him my phone number to call me back when he had them.  Then he didn't call me back within the hour and that's when I realized I didn't have my phone with me.  It was like I just lost my brain this past week.  Sincerely!  So I called him back and he told me that when he went back to get the tickets, the guy he knew wasn't there and that his assistant didnt want to give 3 tickets to him, only 2, but that the other guy would be back soon and he'd call me.    I told my boss I had an emergency situation at school where I may not be able to walk at graduation, sped home, picked up my phone, then sped over to the school.  On the way there, Gilbert called me to tell me he had them in his hand and that he'd wait for me to get there (technically he was supposed to leave at 1pm and I would get there later than that.)  It took me about 35 minutes to get there (its usually an hour drive) and I ran in to get my tickets.  He was very nice.  I bowed down and worshipped his glory.  All hail lord Gilbert!  I tried to give him some money but he wouldn't take it until I shoved it at him and forced him to.  Sped back to work, scarfed down some grub and here I am.  So yeah, I'm okay now.  I could use a stiff drink, though.
