SOOOO many people came! my family is big! and i got a lot of presents! my cousin's boyfriend is hot. i went to skye's after for a bit cause he was having a "get together". matt looked SOOOOOOO extremely, very hot. i just stared at him, like the whole time. he looked really nicccce, i think his shirt may have been a major factor. meh! regardless, he was certainly my eye-candy. today i want to go see peter pan with heather because the guy in it is HOT! and then the library, stupid noah hasn't called me yet and i have no way (well i have a couple but i'm lazy) to contact him, so he'll fail, and i won't. oh well, later. bekah *kisses*
