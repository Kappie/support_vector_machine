I have friends who care about meh, even if that rat bastard doesn't.   *settles down with happy orange mix drink of death, and an eggroll, curtesy of Lindsey*   I have the fan on, it keeps givin me chills....I like^^   My nipples are hard...my ugly, ugly nipples...   *sings louie louie, not thinking how odd it is that I actually know the words*   Three nights..and days..I sail the sea   Think of girl, oh constantly   On that ship, I dream she there (oh boy, wet dreams!)   Aaaaanyway... I'm gonna shift on out now.
