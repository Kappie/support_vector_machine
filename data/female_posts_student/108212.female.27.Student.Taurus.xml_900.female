She's allowed to return to her convent, but it becomes apparent that she is pregnant, though she claims that her virginity is intact.  They transfer her to their sister convent in Japan, where she gives birth to a large lizard that terrorizes the people of Tokyo, but also wears a scapular and prays the rosary.  I know we never talk about politics in here, but all of a sudden,  urlLink Tony Blair makes sense.   Sort of.
