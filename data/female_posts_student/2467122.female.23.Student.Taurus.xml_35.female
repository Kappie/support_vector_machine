We actually had a lot of fun hanging out around Lincoln Center during Midsummer Night Swing after work and watching people make fools of themselves trying to dance.  It was pretty cool, and the ballet itself was beautiful.  Swan Lake by the American Ballet Theater- the sets were amazing and the music was incredible.  I should go to more cultural events like that- as long as someone else is paying!  In other news, Saturday afternoon I dragged my mom out to the  urlLink K-Rock Dysfunctional Family Picnic 8 .  It was  really  cool!!!  There were a lot of punk bands at the festival stage-  urlLink Taking Back Sunday ,  urlLink Story of the Year ,  urlLink New Found Glory  and a couple other local bands.  I saw Winnie the Pooh crowd surfing and he even got on stage!  Mad props to that kid- it was really hot out for that costume (trust me, I know)!    After the festival stage acts were done, the main stage acts came on and they were pretty awesome!!!  The Beastie Boys were by far the best act of the night, but The Darkness, The Strokes, and even Cypress Hill were unbelievable, as well.  My only complaints were how many fourteen and fifteen year old kids were roaming around and being annoying (thank God  I  was never like that!), AND the fact that beer was nowhere to be found!!!  OH, THE HUMANITY!!!  I'm totally going to go to the Warped Tour and Lollapalooza now.  Having fun is addictive, lol!  I am also super excited about Aerosmith and Cheap Trick on Thursday... Must find some "concert enhancers" by then.  Anyways, here's another cool quiz.  Leave your results!!!    Peace out, Homies!!!    YOU ARE MEATWAD -- A little ball of raw hamburger meat, Meatwad is a friendly, optimistic, happy little fellow.  He is extremely dumb, however, and often very gullible.  He loves dancing, playing with his homemade dolls, and is often chased and injured by Master Shake.  Does very little for the Aqua Teens, but he has a good heart.    urlLink   What 'Aqua Teen Hunger Force' character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
