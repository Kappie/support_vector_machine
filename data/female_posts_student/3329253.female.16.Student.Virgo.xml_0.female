Maybe I have an affinity for cats now I dunno but OMG Puss in Boots Rocks my Socks! They based his character on Zorro - man I love that cat!  Anyway from the beginning. I missed the bus at first today - whoops my bad. Oh well I think I also phoned Tom by accident. On my cell phone. Whoopsies. Yeh - I forgot to lock it. (i'm sorry!) anyway what was i talking about... Oh right my GRAND LRT ADVENTURE!   It started at the university - then it snaked across to the governement center (which is across the river) and then to other stations and it ended at Churchill station. whoo hoo! and it kinda ends there. But then it goes in rewind. because i took it back the the university after that day... and it was more eventfull because chris broke a bylaw... hahaha yeh - that was eventful  -till next time
