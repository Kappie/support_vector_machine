Those cute little things that Pat would do or say just isn't cute anymore. I've heard it before, it's time to step it up and treat me right. Lately I've been getting hit on... A LOT. And people keep trying to hook me up with "friends" of theirs. Like Shana - wants me to hook up with Heath. Jake gave John my number and I just spent the last hour on the phone with me. Julie wants to hook me up with a guy named Joe. Why now? Why never before? I haven't changed, or at least I think I haven't. So why now? I just wrote this to Pat: My whole mind is going in circles, and I'm getting so sick of it. I'm sorry for the way I've been lately, but here's why. Lately, I've noticed that a lot of guys are suddenly interested in me. I get hit on every other day, and guys that I've known for awhile are suddenly interested in me. Not only that, but people are constantly trying to hook me up with other people. Just to name a few, Shana wants me to hook up with Heath, Jake's trying to hook me up with John, and Julie wants to hook me up with Joe. I know NONE of these guys, but yet they think it's a good idea. Why am I suddenly getting this attention? I haven't changed. It seems that the more I get attatched to you, people try to take me away and test me. They test me GOOD, temp me with things and use their knowledge about you and me against me. People who don't even know you want you to be out of my life. I haven't complained to ANYONE lately (besides Tasha) about anything you've done/haven't done. Jealousy? I don't know. I've heard so much lately about how I shouldn't waste my time with you and how "I deserve better" that it makes me want to scream. I don't want to hear that shit! If I felt the same way, I'd definantly be dating one of the many guys who supposibly want to be with me. It hurts me when people talk trash about you or our "relationship" and it's not right. The only person who has been supportive about things, has been Tasha. Jereme doesn't really say anything at all about it, but then again, I don't talk to him. People make things seem so much worse than it really is. They put these thoughts about how things should be - in my head. Like, how you treat me. Everyone says I need to be treated better, like a princess. You're damn right I should, but I shouldn't have to give up on you to get it. You have been treating me pretty good, compaired to the way things used to be, and I appreciate it. I'm just so frusterated with people who think they have the right to tell me how to run my life, and who think they have the right to rip you apart and make you sound so shitty. I haven't said anything about people always saying shit because I tend to be over-protected towards you. I don't want you to get upset, or pissed off at people, because when I see you like that, it makes me hurt inside. As I write this, someone is trying to convince me to find someone else, and I went off. I told her that she needs to keep her comments to herself because she doesn't know you, or even half of what our "relationship" is about. She called me a stubborn little bitch and said I was completely blind. Blind to what? If anyone's blind, it's everyone who has to make stupid fucking comments like that. How can people judge you and me if they're not involved with it? I informed her that yes, even if other people don't believe me, I love you. And I love you for always being there for me. I can honestly say that you're the only one who truely watches out for me and supports me, and even cares that much about me, though, sometimes you don't show that. Sometimes I think about the past and I worry about being hurt again, but I have a lot of faith in you. I trust you with my heart. And lately, I've noticed a little more effort from you. Like, talking to your mom. I didn't expect you to EVER do that. I guess now I just wish something else would happen. I don't know, I'm just ranting. Give me a call after you read this so we can talk, please.
