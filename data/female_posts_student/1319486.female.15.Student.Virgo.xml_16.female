When you're 600 years old, someone might ask you to do something REALLY big.   3. Don't listen to critics -- do what has to be done.   4. Build on the high ground.   5. For safety's sake, travel in pairs.   6. Two heads are better than one.   7. Speed isn't always an advantage. The cheetahs were on board, but so were the snails.   8. If you can't fight or flee -- float!   9. Take care of your animals as if they were the last ones on earth.   10. Don't forget that we're all in the same boat.   11. When the doo-doo gets really deep, don't sit there and complain-- shovel!   12. Stay below deck during the storm.   13. Remember that the ark was built by amateurs and the Titanic was built by professionals.   14. If you have to start over, have a friend by your side.   15. Remember that the woodpeckers INSIDE are often a bigger threat than the storm outside.   16. Don't miss the boat.   17. No matter how bleak it looks, there's always a rainbow on the other side.
