Does this mean that without school, I'm devoid of interesting things to do? Possibly, considering that "to do" always involved a chapter, a patient write up, or a clinic assignment, paying bills, visiting the salon, working out and shopping for groceries for my belly and my feet..shoes are essential...Regardless, I'm back to the grind and loving it..   Have you ever found yourself, making conversation, like really making conversation..like from a ball of clay moldinga sculpture of the most intricate sorts, why has it become so difficult to relate to people..I used to thrive on this the fact that with a few ofthe right questions I was hookedon a person and what they had to say, now it seems tiring and not worth the effort.  Iwanted to write this one down before it became a good idea gone to waste:  He says imagine a couple so deeply in love, that effortless stuff I'vewritten aboutbefore,then one day without notice, reason or fail they end on the ugliest of terms with flying centerpieces and shattered glass. Many a tear filled sleepless night would have passed running playbacks of scenes from their relationship, but astime runs as well, the memory will tire leaving avague blurry vision.Several years pass, and each in their own respective lives begins to have dreams bringing these visions back into focus, but the dreams are not luscious or loving. They are of wrought iron contorted into malformed objects and steel cages becoming malleable under the force ofa guard rail...perhaps an accident of some sort...one of the two of these characters is forced to a hault on one day's commute form work, and emergency vehicles have crammed both sides of a bridge...They get out of their cars and with enough courage decide to go and aid the victims of the accident...only to find??? He stopped there....A likely candidate for a great novel by a great author, when he finds the time and the courage...
