I will say that one person who did ask was right, but I'm not going to dignify the inquiries by answering anyone.  Some people took this badly and I guess they concluded that if I wouldn't tell them, it must be them. About five people asked me about it, and only one was right. It wasn't meant to cause drama. It was meant to be a sort of catharsis for me. So, assume it was you if you want to and if not, whatever. I'm talking to one person who I'm sure is now convinced he's right.   But here's a general hint about how to approach me. If you think I may be upset with you for some reason, try calling me or being nice about asking me. If you go about it the wrong way, there's no need to ask if I'm mad at you because I'm sure if you screwed up in the way you asked enough, I am now.
