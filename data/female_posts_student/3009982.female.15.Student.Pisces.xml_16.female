I’ve tried sharing with her, the God I know, my best friend. I do not know, she seems uncertain. She needs someone to guide her to Him, and I’m pretty sure that someone is me. At least she listens. She doesn’t mind me preaching. =)  She asked me bout love tonight. She has this constant worry on her future partner problems. Tsk tsk, the things 15 year old kids think of, huh?  She’s afraid she won’t know how to love him, whether her love will be genuine or not, whether he will love her back with the same genuine love.   Come to think of it, I think I went too deep. Oops. This is roughly what I told her:  Human beings can love. But it is not an eternal love. Only God can love eternally, since He Himself is love. So even if a pair of us humans love each other, it is like petrol and arang batu- tidak boleh dibaharui. Sooner or later, it will run out. So for it to last, you gotta get your source from God. Why God? Simply because He is love.   Hmm I hope that’s correct, cos I told her that. And I don’t want to be found telling people the wrong things about God. It would be oh so bad if I were unconsciously going around telling my friends the wrong things bout God.   -Mary-Ruth
