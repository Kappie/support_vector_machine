I hate to admit it, but i miss them terribly . . . of course i didn't except their offer . . . I did send three gushy letters in my disgusting and pathetic way . . . and I meant what I said to them . . . Mom and Dad were in many ways, though abusive, the most wonderful people in the world . . . i cannot comprehend how the Ying and the Yang can exist together in one being, but my parents are a clear case of this . . .   I've never hated my parents . . .never . . . I've been an gry . . .frustrated to the point of madness, but hate, I've never felt . . . unfortunately, that is not the case on the other end . . . Mom has often stated her hate for me, and though I know that she cares for me most of the time, the hate is also very r eal when spoken . . .it has been an underlying feeling since since the day i told her a secret she did not like . . .   However, I don't blame Mom . . . okay, i do put alot of blame on her, but I know the the truth . . .that she is not wholly to blame, even when I feel she is . . . Mom was unloved as a child and the fact that she has been able to give us a much as she has is amazing . . . I hope that Mom and Dad will agree to my proposition that we find a solution without court involvment . . . i also hope they will agree to attending family counseling . . . I just don't know if my brothers are ready for that, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it . . . hopefully I'll have a reply tomorrow to my e-mails . . Hopefully they will be good replies . . . Secret word of the day . . . "hope"
