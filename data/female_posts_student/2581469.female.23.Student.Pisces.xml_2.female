Just make me whatever.. I don't care..  and i know they care.. everyone cares.. no one will want to pay for something they don't want to drink.. people are really particular about their coffee.. and when they say that, they're most likely going to be disappointed..  so we have to either ask them a series of questions about things they don't or don't like (which usually annoys them. which is a good things, but still annoying to us as well) or we just pick something and make it and hope they will at least not make a big deal out of it..  there is an alternative. we always have a Drink of the Day picked out. and it's just fine for someone to come in and say - i'll have whatever the Drink of the Day is.. several people do that.. there's a professor from across the street who drinks nothing but the Drink of the Day.. a good pal o' mine took to that habit.. that's just fine.. because then we have something to make.. something specific..  but if you can't decide and want something random, then pick something random.. don't leave it up to the person making the drink.. there's too much pressure..
