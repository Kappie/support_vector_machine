You don't have to if you don't want to but that would make me feel really special. Haha.  The e-mail address is: studentmailwest@worldview.org  And put "To Laura Warman" in the title of the message. I wont be able to write you guys back or anything btu it would make me happy if you wrote. haha.  Also, another cool thing is that they post pictures all during the week so you should check that out sometime urlLink here   and see if you see me!  It will be under the newest Seattle Pacific University photos.  Wooohoo.
