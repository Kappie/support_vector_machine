I thought it was really well made, I had never seen the movie of it b4, only the play. I liked it a lot. Last night I went to a kind of goodbye party for Zach he's leaving on Sunday for Patrick Henry college in Virginia. It's sad to think about, I'm gonna miss him and the rest of the seniors that graduated this year, well most of the seniors at least. I still feel like I should have gone out with them...It kinda sux and I know I've been whining about this for a long time but why are you guys leaving me behind! haha jk...I'm happy for you guys. I just want to get out of school as soon as possible and I'm doing most of the same crap this year that I have been doing for like 3 years now. 16-19 century history and English? You're kidding me right? I've frikin done it! At least I get to do anatomy and physiology. I'm gonna have a sucky year, I really am. We're gonna have another class of 5 seniors this year, 3 full time, 2 part time. All right let me talk about something interesting....umm, well right now on the guitar I'm working on empty apartment by yellowcard. It's going pretty well but I seriously messed up the tuning on my electric and my tuner is in my mom's car in NH. I tried it on my acoustic a little and got farther on it but then I realized my teachers notes for the next part were also in the car, so I'm putting it on hold for a couple hours. I'm still kinda working on moonlight sonata on my electric, I gotta admit it sounds pretty sweet. I know it sounds kinda doing a classical song on the guitar but believe me, it's an awesome song and even more awesome on the guitar. Well I'm out for now, bye
