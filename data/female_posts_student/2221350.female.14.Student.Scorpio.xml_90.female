The real essay is actually longer and goes on to explain the pagan roots of Christmas, Halloween, valentine's day, and even groundhog day! So here's the shortened part of the essay about Easter, or Ishtar, as I should like to call it.    urlLink  READ THE ENTIRE ESSAY HERE    Easter is not a Christian name. It is Chaldean (Babylonian) in origin - the name Astarte, the queen of heaven. The name Astarte as found on the Assyrian monuments was Ishtar ((pronounced ÂEasterÂ)) We must remember that Ishtar of Babylon was the same goddess worshiped throughout the world under various names, such as the Egyptian fertility god, Artemis, the Roman goddess of licentiousness, Venus, the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite, and the Ephesian, many-breasted fertility god, Diana, as well as many others.  The (Easter) bunny, the oldest pagan symbol of fertility - Semiramis - has absolutely NOTHING to do with the birth of Christ. Sunrise services are for the worship of the Pagan Sun god - ONLY!  One mythological legend says that sometime after Semiramis died, a huge egg dropped from heaven. Out of the egg came a re-incarnated Semiramis, now a goddess. The Babylonian Talmud refers to her as Ishtar, or Easter.  The forty days of Lent symbolize one day for each year of Tammuz' life, the son of the pagan goddess Semiramis! This period of time is celebrated in the "Christian" church by giving up something to mourn the death --- of Tammuz!   "The hot cross buns of Good Friday and the dyed eggs of Easter Sunday figured in the Chaldean rites just as they do today. The Âbuns,' known by the identical name, were used in the worship of the queen of heaven, the goddess Ishtar, as early as the days of Cecrops, the founder of Athens, that is, 1500 years BEFORE the Christian era. One species of sacred bread which used to be offered to the gods was called ÂBoun.'Â The hot cross buns are not now offered, but eaten instead, on the festival of Easter (Astarte - Ishtar).  The ancient Druids bore an egg as the sacred emblem of their order. In the mysteries of Bacchus, as celebrated in Athens, one part of the nocturnal ceremony consisted in the consecration of an egg. The Hindu fables celebrate their mundane egg as of a golden color. In China, even as late as the 19th century, dyed or painted eggs were used during sacred festivals.
