The magician seemed to promise that something torn to bits might be mended without a seam, that what had vanished might reappear, that a scattered handful of doves or dust might be reunited by a word, that a paper rose consumed by fire could be made to blossom from a pile of ash.        But everyone knew it was an illusion.        The true magic of this broken world lay in the ability of the things it contained to vanish, to become so thoroughly lost, that they might never have existed in the first place.  " --Michael Chabon,  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay       Tried tomake sense of the last week, how it began and what it turned into before anyone could blink, and the only thing that comes close is that book. Everythingis going just as the heroes have always dreamed, but dared not hopetoo seriously for, andtheystillhave so much ahead of them, not the least ofwhich is enjoying each moment that seems to carryits own unbelievably perfect gift. And then they're blindsided by the most tragic, crippling event and even holding the book suddenly becomes painful.   He's on his way back to Montana today with his stepmom and her mother. They'll get Marj (stepmom)settled and arranged before he makes his ride back to Bozeman sometime this week. As unbearable as it all has been, it seems that the most difficult part still lays ahead. And the only thing that keeps me from curling up and crying for him are the memories.   Thursday was the hardest, I think. He decided to speak at the funeral, to give his dad a proper goodbye and all of Mitch's friends an image of their old ski buddy, co-adventurer, and friend. But the pastor who married Mitch and Marj had things to say first. Levi's aunts and I exchanged knowing glancesbetween us throughout his sermon and made frequent looks overat Levi to make sure he wouldn't berushing the stage. The man mentioned Mitch's name no more than three times. Oh, he would  use his name to illustrate a particular passage or Bible story, but heonlyspoke  of  Mitch a scant few times.   But Levi kept it together as he stood behind the podium and we all sighed huge as he began. We cried as we listened to the nicknames (Dirthead, Uncle Dirt, Dirt 13), and laughed at the image of Mitch sneaking in chicken soup from his mom because Stacey (his first wive, Levi and Olivia's mom) couldn't cook. And as he spoke of his father's generosity, sincerity, kindness, humor and sly grin Levi wishes he'd inherited, I watched in awe of his ability to hold everyone around him as they cried, lifting them up, his back never breaking and comedic timing never failing.   I always knew that about you, hon. Your ability to make everyone else feel better, no matter what you're feeling; to be the unwavering support, to be exactly what someone else needs whenever they need you. So I shouldn't have been surprised to see youdo precisely that over and over, even though your heartwas breaking.   You amaze me, Luke. You havehis grin and mischievous sparkle in youreye, as well as everything else you honor in him. You're my hero, and I hope to be like you when I grow up.   Thegravesite service was blessedly short, and as themasses cleared, leaving only Mitch's good friends and wilder relatives, a cousin brought out an armful of six-packs and everyone grabbed a bottle. The toast kicked off the beginning of a long night ofpartying, just as he would have wanted. A friend stayed behind to make sure the empties and piles of dirt on top of the casket stayed put as the grave was sealed and covered.   After a much-needed break with Stacey's sisters and their families back at the condo, we made our way to one of Mitch's friend's home, where vodka tonics were followed by Mexican beers, followed by Jamaican rum and Coke, followed by more beer. The most surreal moment of the evening came after listening to more stories about Dirthead, icy roads at 120 mph andforgotten friends in the truckbed. The Boy and I found ourselves in a circle with his mom, sister, aunts, neighbors, cousins, and Mitch's friends, passing joints and laughing our asses off.   The party continued back at the condo, where I acted upon Stacey's recommendation that someone start writing some of this shit down. And so, here are some snipets of the evening. Don't ask us what half of them mean, but they all were the funniest things we'd ever heard/said at the time:   " Damn  that woman can crochet!"   " And  there's a shitter!"   "You want us to lay down with you?"   "Where is that Brit?" "Stickin' it in your aunt!"   "It's like 'Stacy's Mom', but different!"   "You guys, I've never been this fucked up before..."   "If you eat the muffins tonight..." "You'll have to make do with eight Almond Bear Claws."   "Aunt Sharyn is a bit like Gollum."   "Pakistanis are always the butt of jokes." "That's because they're all taxi drivers."   "I bet Grandpa was like 'God-fucking-damnit!'" "Your grandfather   NEVER  said that!" "What? He never said 'God'?"   "She slays me, I tell ya!"   "If I were sober..." "I'd kick you where it hurts!"   "I'm ready for love!"   The only thing better than experiencing each of those firsthand was relating them to Levi's grandmother the next night. Later, Levi and I took his sister, Olivia out to Charleys for our own celebration. Natalie joined us eventually and the circle of friendswas completed when Jen called. We drank, laughed, talked and bondedlike never before. When the DJ played Billy Idol and AC/DC back-to-back, I knew Mitch approved.   And now, I find myself in a much-too-hot apartment with half the day gone, thinking about a man I met only once but have finally gotten to know. He was beautiful, crazy, genuine, adoring of his children, and never spent a day doing anything he didn't believe in.   We've come to the part in the book where everything has changed and we wonder how there can be another chapter; how can the heroes go on after so much happened? But they do; the story always does. And so will we. So open a bottle of beer today, put on some U2,TomPetty, Coldplay, or Lynnard Skinnardand drink a toast to Mitch. Or the next time you're driving down a dirt road and "Bad to the Bone" or "She Drives Me Crazy" comes on the radio, crank it up andsing loudfor ol' Dirthead.
