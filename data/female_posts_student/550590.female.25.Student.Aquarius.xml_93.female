There is good news.  I'm going to see Thomasito in a few weeks when we go to North Carolina for Memorial Day weekend.  Until then I have new interns to train, a shitload of work to do, jobs to interview for, and on top of all that Shawn has made me his Uniform Sewing Bitch...The things I do for you men in my life.  Sheesh.  And I'm not even getting any out of the deal.  NOTE: That was in NO WAY a hint or suggestion that Shawn and I have having an affair, contrary to popular belief around the Office.  Katie would kick my ASS.  :)
