That's the name of my old band teacher's band, Mike Butterfield, he's in town! *glee* He had to move away to Quebec because of cancer, but he's back, he was so amazing, had the town under his thumb, I learned so much with him..." So anyways I stole the poster from its telephone pole, my mother excitedly bought us tickets, and we went tonight. Well, we would have gone. I cannot get into the back of Panama Red's - it's a bar. I'm disappointed. My mom was mad - she can't get her money back. I feel like pouting, it's just that there's no point. I really wanted to see him. I think they should have planned better, because he did teach a lot of kids. Chris (from band) couldn't get in either. Aw, dammit. It would have been so much fun with Chris there. I wish we could have known it was in the bar beforehand...
