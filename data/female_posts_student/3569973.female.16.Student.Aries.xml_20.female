Okay...monday...lets see...Im really not sure what I did monday, the only thing that I can remember was that I finished painting and went to Jakes Aunt's house to see her new baby...but thats all I can remember, so lets just skip over that day and go to tuesday. Ahh yes tuesday I do remember tuesday. I ended up waking up at 6 that morning and went running at about 6:30...realized I was out of shape and was back about 15min. later...lol. Then I went back to sleep woke up when Jake called and waited for him to come over here so that we could go to cash my check in and go to burleson looking like we just got out of bed, which we had just done. We went looking for furniture and a new mattress, which this guy was gonna end up selling to us for $300 less than the regular price, so he gave us his card and we never went back, even though this was the nicest bed I have ever laid on in my ENTIRE LIFE!! Then later I came home and Jake went back home and then went to play tennis...so Sarah, Jessica, and Brandy came over to help me move my furniture and stuff and then we went over to Sarahs. At about 9:20 we went to Brandys and then to the wal-mart in Cleburne...OMG I havent had soo much fun in awhile. We went EVERYWHERE!!! It was a blast I havent laughed soo hard in awhile. Then we were home at about 11 or 12 or something like that and were up until like 2 when we finally passed out and woke up about 7 hours later. Jessica found that I talk in my sleep and its amazing that she just now realized it...lol. Then we went out to Panchos only paid 2.99...lol...its a long story...got full....almost threw up...and its was soo much fun. I came home at about 4 to kinda put things up and to get ready for work (which I was almost late to). Then got home at about 9:15, watched the last show of The Ultimate Love Test...which is one of the most AWESOMEST shows ever. Took a shower, watched Friends...and here we are. So since I finally wrote down all of that meaningless crap that your gonna read later for you entertainment...Im going to sleep. Till then, Later Days
