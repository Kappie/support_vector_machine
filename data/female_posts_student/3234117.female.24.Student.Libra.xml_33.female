Well I didn't get up too terribly early, but since my body is now accustomed to sleeping in til 1030 or 11, getting up at 9 was hard work! And all for nothing! My sister spent the night last night and we had planned on getting up and going to IHOP for breakfast as we both had to get up early. She had a massage and I had an interview. So I get all dressed up and we go eat at IHOP. After IHOP, on my way to my interview I call my home number to see if I have any messages. I'm glad I did as it turned out my interview got cancelled and is rescheduled for tomorrow. Not bad. It means another work free day for Rebecca. I am really the worst employee. I'm surprised I still have a job.   Anyway on to other things. I ate out like 5 times since Friday for lunch. It's a lot of eating out, but out of all those 5 times, I only got decent service at one place I ate at. And I think that was at an ice cream place. Terrible! Waitstaff really makes me crazy sometimes! My sister says I get annoyed too easily. This may be true, but if the people didn't annoy me for some reason, I probably wouldn't be annoyed. We did get a free meal though at On the Border.   I also had the joy of meeting my sister's new dating partner last night as he lives close to me. And the kid really annoyed me. He would not shut up the whole time he was here. AND we were watching a movie. Maybe he was nervous, I don't know, but he got annoying after awhile. He's a nice kid though and my sister seems to like him. So I kept my mouth shut and I also had a beer. I felt better after the beer!  I should probably work on being nicer to people. I am a nice girl. I just get annoyed at stupid people. I really got to work on this as I'm positive I'll be talking to lots of stupid, crazy people in my field.
