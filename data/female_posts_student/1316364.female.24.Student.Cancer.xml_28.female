All you could see was sand and tents, sand and more tents. It was a little scary to think that his was all they had to protect them from the elements. I can’t really say how seeing these pictures made me feel. I just got this strange feeling over me when I saw them, like I was expecting a little more for our troops. It is just so surreal sometimes. The only comforting thing was that one of the pictures had her husband in it. He had a big smile. Underneath all of that dirt and dessert camouflage there was a smile. I can only pray that our guys are ok. I know that they should be fine, but something in my head keeps saying, you never know… I wish that Jesse would call home soon, just so I knew he was ok.
