They wanted me in their group so that we could read our essays and I didn't want to read mine, so Arlo fkn reads it, which is ok I guess, besides the fact they were acting like dicks and being guys, but still...It's ok they said they liked it, so no worries. But I didn't need to John to freaking yell out in class "you're dating a guy in Nebraska, that's 20 that you met on the net", :::class goes quite::: My face was bright red, then I had John Rajala ask me all the questions across the room and Jordan and Justin and Ms. Williams, I'm like people hello?! We've met no worries! Then since John (Rae) isn't done with his paper I was going to be like "hey John you need to finish your paper!" That blackmailed him and he was like naw naw, I made it up! Haha that's right baby! Actually I don't have a problem with people knowing, it's just the age difference, I think it's only illegal to have sex, but I'm not sure, anyways he's going to be 18 for now, lol. The only reason John knew about him in the first place it because him and Arlo are in my theatre class and me, Rhonda, and Dylan talk sometimes, and he sits by Dylan, so yeah, plus I'm loud and yeah...It was actually funny in a way, but all is forgotten now, llol oh wells... :)   I hate everything about you, why do I, love you?
