I had a very scary thought today as i sat on a blanket in Kuehn park with a preschooler on my lap and 8 more scattered around me. The story was about an Octopus i believe, not very enthralling for me but the kids sure liked it. Anyway, I remembers what I had said to Jamie last night about Samford. We were talking about private college over public and I was talking about the biggest reason that I'm choosing private church affiliated schools over any public schools. It's not that I'm afraid of the public school surrounding... And I don't think that I'm so weak in my faith that i would end up turning in my newboys and relient K for Emenim or Marilyn Manson... But there's not a doubt in my mind that going to Samford is going to be the best thing I can do for myself spiritually. I'm so excited at the thought of going to a school that will surround me with people that are thirsting for the same thing I am. Samford isn't like other religious colleges. Their affiliation with the Southern Baptists isn't just a way for them to receive funding or to attract more and more Southern Baptists... It's a sign that every program every professor every class makes it very clear that God is present there. That's why I want to go to Samford.  By the way... This isn't the scary part. What I said next was, jokingly, "Besides... If I'm going to meet my dream man in college, i figure i have better odds there." The truth is I have fully accepted the fact that I'll prolly never have a (cough.. Another) relationship until college. Not to say I don't know perfectly darling (mk word!) guys now... I just can't imagine ( b/c it's not like I have much hope for it anymore) anything getting off the ground until I am in college. What scares me is that I'm counting on it. I'm building up my future around the fact that between the years of 2005 and 2009 I will meet the man I am to marry and marry very soon after that. Then, he can start his career and I can start my meager earnings as a youth pastor. What struck me today is there is that very real possibility that he won't be at Samford. I might not be telling my children one day "your father and I met at the college, at the same college that both of MY parents met at... Sigh." It might not happen. And then what? What if I can't make it as only a youth pastor. What if my fallback option of a family counselor doesn't pick up. What if I don't find someone till I'm 30 and until them am living miserably because I built my whole career up on the fact that I wouldn't have to be making all the money? It seems WAAAY to early to be thinking about this (I wonder if anyone is still reading at this point... b/c i bet you find this very boring) but maybe I've started thinking about it just in time. I've always scoffed at high school couples that change so much of their daily lives to betogether. They'll switch churches, or join each other's activities, plan out their summers together. Then they break up and they have to drop so much. I'm so very against doing this in high school yet that's what I've done in my mind. I've built up a whole plan around a man soon to be identified and... What if it doesn't happen.  I think I need to start buiding my plans around me.. with room for additions. Not around the additions with room for plans.
