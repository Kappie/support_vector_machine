A few weeks ago, the only feeling of hope (since we are sadly long beyond the "I believe in a place called Hope" days) I had were tied up in Michael Moore and his message. That is all very well and good, and having seen F 9-11 on Monday I do believe very much in his movies and his message.  We really need more now though, and I believe we may actually have it.  The double-bind that we've been in is not only the need for a strong candidate to beat Bush, but also a candidate that people can get really, really excited about.  Perhaps you've forgotten about that expression "true believer."  Perhaps you've forgotten what it feels like to be excited. I have.  All I have felt for four years is betrayal, fear and absloute, searing rage.  And I haven't felt these things in an abstract, removed way.  I am talking about very real, very personal and debilitating feelings.  I don't hate George Bush in a theoretical way. I hate him the way you hate people who deeply hurt those close to you.  If you want to remember what it felt like in 1992, take a look at this  urlLink TIME magazine cover  and take a deep, long breath.  I am still not sure about Kerry, but I am a "TB" in John Edwards.  I don't believe in him the way you believe in the least-awful choice, I believe in the way that makes you feel like maybe everything will really be okay.  I feel like I have been inured to this bullshit Bush rhetoric of black-and-white morality, meaningless catchphrases and empty threats, peppered by hunting euphamisms.  I feel so energized by the fact that people like me may once again be able to participate in discussions of values and morality, and what we'll be talking about is equality and just distribution of our nation's resources rather than gay marriage or abortion.  I believe in morality and family values, but not the George Bush kind.  I want to be able to talk about these things again without necessarily invoking the Christian right.  By the way, as a sidenote:  don't you feel like if you ripped Dick Cheney's face off it would reveal some sort of mechanical, robotic system with blinking lights and lots of wires?  Or am I the only one who fantasizes about ripping Dick Cheney's face off?  Anyhow, if you want to read more than just my opinions about why Kerry-Edwards is the ticket, check out  urlLink Arianna Huffington's short piece  from Salon.  It is in list-form and I know you people like lists.
