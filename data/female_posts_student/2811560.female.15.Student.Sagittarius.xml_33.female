That was probably the reason I forgot my gym uniform. Anyways, wind ensemble was fine, chorus was ok, we were sight-reading this one song, and I guess I was singing too loud, because she told me not to sing. OMG, they sucked really, really bad. Yuck. She said I have to blend more, which is hard to do because I'm like the only one who sings with vibrato in the sopranos. I'm not about to change the way I sing to compensate for those who aren't at my level yet. Hehe, that makes me sound like a pompous bitch, doesn't it? Sorry about that. Anyways, Jeff was being such an ass today. He said "Liz, you're such a freshman." Ugh. Coming from Jeff?! Well, excuse me. And he said this because I didn't know if some upperclassmen couple had broken up or not. Grr, he makes me so mad. So yeah, my day wasn't that bad except for the fact that I couldn't change in gym due to the fact that I forgot my uniform. So I had to sit out with all the delinquents and watch everyone else play pickleball. Fun stuff.
