I just ran out of patience and lost it and dragged everyone along for a ride.  Then we had a "group" meeting that invovled the members of my office and Ben, which was instigated by Ben to address all the problems in the lab.  He must be dreaming if he thinks that by just saying he would prefer it if people told him to his face their problems instead of bitching behind their backs.  Little does he reaslie that I'm spiteful enough to do it just because he told me not to.  But he is a fucking hypocrite anyhow, so that just lost him the little respect he had left in my eyes. {end rant}  Played disc golf yesterday afternoon.  Was throwing the disc with Rob beforehand and was pulling out some big throws, but of course there was no chance that I could do that when trying to play golf :)  It rained and we got soaked, then we went to Alex's for Pizza and video games.
