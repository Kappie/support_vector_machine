I'm happy one day and having a good time and then, I'm sad the next or really angry/in a bad mood...the case for today. Heh. That's not good...  God, I wish MC, Kel, and Kath were here. I wish Joanne was here too. I wanted to hang out with Chris too and it doens't look like that's going to happen. He told me he was hanging out with Kristen today and then he didn't and I tried to get a hold of him but the first time I called a while back, he didn't answer because he was on the phone or something and the second time I called he was already out with Bryan and Matthew. Ugh. Today sucks.   Plus, I got mad at someone for the first time ever todaay...well, the first time ever being mad at them. I'm still kind of mad but, I guess not as much. I wouldn't have been mad had the conversation ended decently but, it didn't and thus...my angryness comes in. I get angry so rarely though. It's odd.
