The iriver H120 can hold up to 600 hours of music and has a 16 hour battery life. It even has an FM tuner and a voice recorder. At first it's a bit hard to figure out if you're at all like me and instruction manuals don't seem to explain how to work the object you've got but instead some CIA cryptology system, but once you get used to it, it's as simple as...... something very simple.   Very useful for switching quickly from Britney Spears to AFI when a cute guy happens to appear around the bend to see what you're listening to......
