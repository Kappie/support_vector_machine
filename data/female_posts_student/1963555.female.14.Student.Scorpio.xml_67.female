The reason why there has been a lot of absent periods is each time I log in I look for a certain blogspot that I used to read over the summer. I forgot the site name for like 4 months and finally I'm listening to the Taking back sunday cd, and the name hit me! I was sooooooo happy. the guy's name who writes in it is Penguin. He's so awesome. He has a crush on a chick and she doesn't know ect. it's really sweet. I like him....
