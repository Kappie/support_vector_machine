I was standing was walking to my next class after tech when Steph ran up all excited and asked if I'd seen her sunburn. I was looking at her face and it looked a bit red but not too bad. So she proceeded to remove her shirt in the middle of the corridor. God, that was the worst sunburn I'd ever seen. Blurggh. How do you manage to get a sunburn only on your breasts? I would've asked her but I was trying to avoid further embarrassment.  Some dude in Lucia's 6th period starting speaking in tongues and making bizarre prophecies today, apparently he didn't know he was doing it and it scared the hell out of Ms. L. Of course, they weren't   normal  prophecies, they were all things like "Someone will throw catsup at the computers!" and "You will find your mozzarella on the ceiling!". But still, he could be a prophet, you never know.  Ah well, I should do something productive now. Or sleep. Whatever comes first.
