YAY whitneys partay tonight!  its gonna be great... its from 7-11 for all you who didnt hear about the time change.  and everyone congratulate michael mooney.  he is officially a "Mensan".  way to go moonerz!  oh yeah, my cell phone number is 214-695-2073 so call me and make me feel special and important and loved!  even if you have nothing to say!  still call me and we can just waste my minutes.  alright thats all i've got for now... so check back later for more insights into my extremely uneventful life  bye!
