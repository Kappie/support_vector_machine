Make-up: None. Too early. Weather: It's England. Therefore rain.   *~RANT OF THE DAY~* Oh yeah. My friend is such an irritating bitch. Well, not my friend any more. All because I'm now in a serious relationship with her ex boyfriend....Mardy cow. He hasn't wanted her for almost 3 years! YES, 3 years they have been broken up for and she still can't let go! I think she needs to grow up and go see a shrink or something, because she is not wired up right!   No matter what she does or says, she is not going to split me and David up and the quicker she realises that the better. Can't tell her tho. Pretty pathetic for a 21 year old. Yes, I am 17, yes David is 24. But what's age when love strikes? NOTHING.  Besides. None of her business. BITCH. I wonder if her car door would like to see my car keys? Hmm. Now theres a thought.  *~THE GOOD STUFF~*  David and I are going out for a meal tonight. Going to buy him the new Keane album later. He has the prettiest bright blue eyes...*dreaming* Ahem. And bloody   brilliant  in bed...And the mini...And anywhere else...   MUCH better than my ex. But lets not get me started on that wanker either.  Going for a scan today at 3:50...Reality might sink in then that I'm actually having baby. I didn't do it on purpose, I had big plans for myself. Wanted to go to University next year. I can hear it now, fluttering out of the window...OOOH, that quote was from Hercules...(excuse me, I have a passion for anything Disney. Except Snow White. HATE that film.)  MUST BUY: New underwear. New top. Keane Album. Scan photo.  YAY. I get to be with David all night tonight. YAY.
