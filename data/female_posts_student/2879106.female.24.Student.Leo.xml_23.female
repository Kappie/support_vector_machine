I did go off on this guy I work with again today. That was fun!!!!He is such an idiot but because he knows a lot of big words and can articulate himself well, all the girls think he is soooo smart. Fortunately, for me I am smarter than many of the girls I work with and I can see right through his facade. Anyway, that is enough about work.  Tiffany is going to the hospital tomorrow and she may have to have surgery. I don't really want to talk about what she has to have surgery on but I can say that I am really worried about her. I am just tired of everyone in my family being sick. Luckily, dad is doing a lot better and he hasn't really had any more major problems. Hopefully, we will get him better yet.   Lastly, I miss Alek. He just left and he will be back Sunday but I still miss him. I know I shouldn't complain because I am going to have to get used to this. I just hope that we can work everything out before he leaves. I feel as if we just jumped back into our old habits and really didn't work on our problems. It's as if we are just ignoring things hoping that they will go away. I wish we could just talk about this openly and honestly. A friend of mine gave me advise last night saying that I need to just sit him down and not let him squirm his way out of answering my questions. I think that is good advise, I just hope I have the balls to make it happen. I guess we will see. I will keep you updated on everything.  P.S. Everyone say a prayer for Alisha's Aunt who has cancer. If we all pray for her and her family, hopefully things will get a lot better for her soon.
