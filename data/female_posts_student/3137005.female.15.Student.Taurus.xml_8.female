Rob Thomas    ('The step in my groove')     'For myself I am an optimist - it does not seem to be much use being anything else.'   Sir Winston Churchill (1874 - 1965), speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet, London, November 9, 1954  Hello again good reader of my blog. This posting is devoted to that deep and very meaningful question.....  'Who would win in a fight Obi Wan Kenobi or Spock??'  Personally I think Obi and here are my reasons..... 1.Obi wan can use the force which could just wip phasers or anything straight out of your hand like.....well that! 2. Spock has silly hair and ears! 3. Ligthsaber vs. Phaser!!! Duh!!!! Lightsaber would win! 4. Obi wan is a Jedi master, spock is just an alieny dude.  5. Obi wan is just better!!! 6. Obi wan could get other jedis to fight the rest of spock's crewmates 7. The jedis would win this fight. 8.Obi wan talks cooler! He has a cool accent! 9. Obi wan is just better!!!!! 10.Obi wan could use mind tricks on Spock, plus Obi is just better!!!!        We love you Obi Wan!!!!!!    All for now Dani ps. Voom! Voom! I love lightsabers. pps.I am hungry!!!!
