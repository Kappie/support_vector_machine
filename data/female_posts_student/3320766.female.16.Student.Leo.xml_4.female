All I do is sit and listen to their shitty pity stories and they don't even give me the time of day to hear my shitty hole stories.  My thoughts aren't right. I can't understand them anymore so don't ask me anymore advice. I'm insane I can't even listen to my own thoughts let alone anyone else's. I don't know why you want to hear what I'm thinking. Take the chip out of my head. No in fact I'll do it myself. I'll take this knife to my own forehead digging in the spaghetti called my brain. Maybe if I pour some tomato sauce in it maybe it will even taste good. Who knows it's no different from eating meat I guess except my brain will still be alive, still be thinking, still be ticking.
