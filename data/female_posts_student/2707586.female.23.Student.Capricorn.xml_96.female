    
       So I signed a lease on an awesome apartment. I can't wait to move in but I have another month before that will happen. School is almost over and finals really suck as do projects. Hopefully I will get everything done before the end of the semester. Not much else is happening around West Lafayette except that my softball team make the playoffs which is pretty cool. Other than that, I hope everyone is doing great and good luck on your finals if you have them.
