Here they are... 5. because she looks like barbie with a bad face lift being fingered   4. because she looks way to happy to be plastered against a wall in an ugly dress   3. because of the ridiculous look on her face and um... it looks like the bottom of her dress went through a paper shredder, in a bad way.   2. for the love of god just look at it... IT'S SHINY!! It looks like she's been vaccuum sealed in a horribly colored plastic bag   1. this one just tops them all ... it looks like a 5 year old took their arts and crafts  materials and some horrible pink fabric, glued it all together, and called it a dress
