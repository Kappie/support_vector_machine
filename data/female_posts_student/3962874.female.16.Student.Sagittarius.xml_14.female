Being me (the stupid one) I assumed that the only reason Daniel wanted to go down there was because I went down there with Sam and other people before. He has never been down there and it didn't really seem like he wanted to. So I told him that and he got really mad at me and then we kinda got in a fight and we ended up coming back. It wasn't too bad, though I did realize that I am very blunt and kinda retarded. It happens to the best of us. Anyway I went to bed early and Daniel stayed up chatting with people online. Woohoo.
