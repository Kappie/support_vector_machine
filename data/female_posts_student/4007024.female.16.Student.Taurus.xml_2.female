IT SUCKS. i lay in bed all day because i feel like complete shitttttttt.  update on the paper: i'm moving along.. slowly but surely. :-/ oh and i'm almost done reading a lesson before dying. i must say, it is way better than the great gatsby. that was probably the most awful book i've EVER read. --no offense if you enjoyed it.   i went to lafayette yesterday with the family ( yes i know, shoot me ) but i needed to get clothes.. brennan ( my 12 yr. old step brother ) annoyed me the whole way up there and i wanted to wreck the car on his side just to shut his ass up. :-) ( i'm evil, yes i know ). then my mom was in a bitchy mood b/c brennan was getting on her last nerve so she only wanted to get stuff i can wear to school.. ( so yes, another reason why i wanted to beat his ass ). so much for the great shopping trip i was planning.   last night i watched cruel intentions 3 and it was a good movie.. ( if you like twisted, fucked up, sex movies. ) but it turned out to be pretty good. kayla said it was good so i rented it b/c there isn't shit to rent at blockbuster ( either one ) and i'm just getting very upset with them lately.b/c yes i go there almost every night because all i do is sit at home. :-) i'm just such a party animal.. can't you tell?   well seeing that i really have nothing else to talk about since my life is so damn boring. i'm leaving to go to kaylas. laterrr
