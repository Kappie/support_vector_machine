To be 100% happy with my surroundings.  5. To become a stronger person. 6. To get my degree, no matter how long it takes. 7. To never take life, or anyone/anything for granted. 8. To act my age.  9. To not stress out about things that are beyond my control. 10. To learn to just be happy.  I don't know if anyone has read these posts besides me. I don't even know how to find my own posts half the time. But if I'm lucky and someone does run across this page, please note: I am not as ungrateful, or self absorbed as my rantings may make me seem. I've been re-reading what I have posted and realize how psycho i may sound. And how obsessed with Mr. Rich I may be. But not so, these are just things that fly into my head and sometimes consume me. He is in my life yes, but not the way I want him to be. Mostly I'm just justifying these rants to myself. But thats okay. Everyone needs a little reassurance that they are not as crazy as they seem every now and then even if it is coming from themselves. Great. Not only do I already talk to myself I'm writing to myself. So much for reassuring myself, lol. Note to self: Consider yourself CONSUMED.
