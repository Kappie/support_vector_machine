Wow ~ That was 4 years ago ! ^-^ Haha ~ I remember one girl I used to be friends with, her mom had seen the picture and said it was really good and then the girl became angry at me ;_; I told the mom that it was a stupid drawing.. but she still was mad >o Anyways, the song I picked for today is really how I have been feeling alot ~ *sigh* (read the song) Wow ~ Listening to F4 makes me think of him .. but I think I always do anyways ^^;  I often catch my self drawing some kind of anime character of him during classes .. ^.^ Am I obsessed !? NO WAY ~  I looked around my room to find my Christmas card list ~ He was on it and now is checked off  ^_^ But I hope I won't be nervous to give it to him.. *blushes* He is the most lucky cause I gave him a note aswell tell him he is my dream guy XD haha ~ I am so scared to hear what he will say to me when he sees it is him !

ENGLISH ~   Quietly awakening...I always, always wish that these fleeting thoughts would reach you...  Unable to move forward across "just a little more" distance The way I see before me is always blocked Every time the days I want to see you but can't pile up, My strong heartbeat turns into heartbreak.  If there is such a thing as "eternity," I want to believe, even if I have to take the long way. Although I know that I've been hurt before because I'm clumsy I won't stop; I won't give in to anyone.  I think of you and that alone is enough to make the tears start to flow now I always, always wish that these fleeting thoughts would reach you...  I've known all too well about pretending to be strong. But since then, my doubts have vanished.  here's definitely things I want to show you And so many words I want to hear I want to see all sides of you, when you laugh and cry So I'll stop waiting and seize my "chance."  I think of you,and I feel like that alone is enough to make my heart grow stronger. I always, always wish that these fleeting thoughts would reach you...  I think of you and that alone is enough to make the tears start to flow now My distant voice can't reach you now, but so that someday it definitely will...Believe.   la la   la la   la la...Believe.   la la   la la   la la...Believe.   la la   la la   la la...
