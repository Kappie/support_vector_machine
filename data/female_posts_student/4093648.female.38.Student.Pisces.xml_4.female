Lists of 100 sounded pretty interesting. The list can be 100 places I want to visit, or 100 foods I dislike or 100 songs I love, or something more self-therapyish like 100 excuses I use for not changing my life, or 100 people who care about me, it can be a list of anything.       The idea is to write as quickly as you can and keep going until you get to 100. List are good for         clarifying thoughts    identifying problems or patterns    brainstorming solutions    getting past the obvious    gathering information quickly    focusing attention on what's  really  going on    filling up space in your blog    According to the book, the first 33 will be predictable, the second 33 or so may be repetitive or show a them, and the last 33 or so will have most of the new ideas and will often get to the root of what is really significant. And repetition is okay.      So here goes. 100 Things that usually lift my mood        going for a walk    reading a book    getting out of the house    talking with a friend    having a pleasant conversational exchange    making someone laugh    having someone make me laugh    reading the posts at Book Crazy    reading with my kids    having someone appreciate me or something I do    getting something accomplished    eating something (healthy)    writing    drinking a latte    drawing    practicing calligraphy    cardio exercise such as running    singing    listening to a book on tape    listening to energizing music    learning something new    taking a shower    finally understanding something I've been struggling with    meeting new people    having a clean house    getting out in the sun    getting dressed up    putting on make up    Getting involved in a good magazine article or non-fiction book    going to the library    wandering around a book store    getting something exciting in the mail    buying a new book    getting new clothes that look good on me    hearing from an old friend    visiting a museum    learning something interesting    starting a new school year    autumn    cool weather    ice skating    a warm sunny day after a long winter    snow, enough snow to go sledding    when it rains all night    riding my bike    going out dancing    having someone flirt with me    watching the birds    getting reacquainted with the books on my shelf    a really good conversation    playing board games    visiting someplace new    going to a baseball game    shooting baskets or hitting a tennis ball against a practice board (something rhythmic mindless and repetitive)    travelling on a train    driving alone on a quiet highway    having time to myself    cooking or baking just because    looking at Asian art, like a brush painting that has a simple theme and graceful elegant lines    looking at photos that I haven't taken out in a while    organizing a space in my house that has been driving me crazy    rearranging the furniture or a shelf, desk, etc.    finding money in the pocket of pants I haven't worn in a while    floating around in a pool    the ocean    feeding the pidgeons at Zilker Park    playing with a dog    playing a game with J___    watching a movie or tv show that makes me laugh    reading a really great poem    sleeping late    having a lazy morning just reading the newspaper    sushi    planning something I look forward to    having coffee or a drink with a friend    seeing something beautiful    someone letting me into their lane in a traffic jam    seeing the Texas wave when I let someone in my lane in busy traffic    witnessing someone being kind    seeing someone who takes pride in their work    people who love their jobs    contagious enthusiasm    people working together as a team    the Yankees losing the World Series    Seeing a team I like take the lead in the bottom of the 9th inning    watching a little league game (when all the parents are supportive and the kids feel good about what they're doing)    hiking high up in the mountains where you can no longer hear any city noises    playing with a toddler, they're so easy to please    watching a favorite happy-ending movie    really delicious food    doing a job well    making a necklace or a bracelet    reading or writing in a coffee shop late at night when everything is quiet and the streets are deserted    hanging out with just girlfriends laughing and talking    finding out that other people think and feel the same things I do    discovering I have something I'm passionate about in common with someone I meet    Passing out candy and seeing all the costumes on Halloween    Doing something by myself that I didn't think I could do    Knowing I handled a difficult situation well, especially with my kids    Trying something new
