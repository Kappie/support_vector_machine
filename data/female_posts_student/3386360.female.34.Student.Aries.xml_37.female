Travis had to go register so we went to the courthouse got that taken care of, stopped and got another loan (I hate doing this but until I can get caught up I need to) stopped paid off a bill, bought a bunk bed set Joey has been looking at. Ok we dont need it, cant really afford it but I can understand why and yeah we could use it so I got it. I will be able to pay for it anyway so I am not to worried about it it will just be a bit more tight but if we sell the bed set in his room and put that towards the bunk beds we are getting then it will be that much easier. (smile) I found out for my program for the computer to enlarge it for me to read without my glasses it will cost me 149.00 of which I dont have. (sigh) I dont know what to do  but I'm not to worried about it. I might be able to deal for a bit longer. I could install if I got rid of my windows... (sigh)..  I didnt get the phone bill paid today but I am going to call them and ask them to let me pay it tomorrow. They should be able to let me but there is no way I can get there. I also got some groceries today. Not alot but enough to some get by until I get the rest of my money. The rent money is sent. Ok I made arrangements to pay the phone tomorrow thankfully they will let me wait the extra day. Whew and I had enough to pay the whole thing PLUS I have 24 dollars left over to go to the dollar store and do some more shopping for things we need (ie. soap, shampoo) YAY.. I'm happy. I'm going to be able to pay off alot of this stuff. I figured out how too. With the money travis pays me after each day's work I am going to put it away. I should be able to have almost all the bills paid / caught up by the end of the month and only be able 50 dollars behind. Once this is done I will be able to breath a bit easier. I dont know why I didnt think of this sooner. Maybe becaue Travis pays so little at a time that is why.    I had such wonderful dreams of AC last night. He was holding me tight in his arms and telling me that I just needed a little more faith and it would all be ok soon. I actually woke up several times feeling his arms around me. I was sleeping alone except for my teddy bear. Goddess I want him here. I am being selfish I know. I wonder if he is thinking of me. This journal has been such a relief to me to be able to write the little things down and know that he can read them at his lesure. I cant wait to see his dancing eyes. (shiver)    Well I should go and put the groceries away and then I will make something to eat. I just checked e mail and nothing from him yet but that is fine I have faith.
