We chose not guilty, so we wouldn't have to pay any fines. We have a court date on August 26th, the judge says. The cop will be there along with Quintin who got called into work. We weren't allowed to give a testimony or anything. ( For some reason, I think the judge should decide if you're guilty or notguilty through your testimony.)   So, last night I had court and then my sister and I went to Amanda's house on the way home. Her mom is from New York, and her Dad is from Italy. They have awesome accents. But her mom likes to cook, so she made us home-made spaghetti. It was the most I've eaten in the past couple of days.  We stopped at blockbuster with Amanda on the way back to our house, and met Alex up there. We rented  Girl with a Pearl Earing  and  Wuthering Heights.  We watched  Girl with a Pearl Earing  first and it was good, but I was the only one who read the book, so I don't think it held a candle to the book. They left out alot in the movie. We started  Wuthering Heights ,   but the acting was so terrible, that we stopped it. For some reason, when my sister and I rent movies we are attracted to the independent films. This is good and bad. Bad, because you can get the movies with absolutely no plot, and horrible acting. Good, because you can run accross one that is really intriguing.  Jason called me last night, and I got to talk to him until 12:45. For some reason, I didn't think he'd actually call me. Maybe that's because of Ben's sorry standards. I really stooped down for Ben. Amanda is in a serious relationship and her boyfriend treats her like a queen. I want someone like that. Someone who will show they care by simple things. Like leaving a rose on my car for me or something. I want someone desparately romantic. I'm jealous of Amanda =).  So, back to Jason. We talked about alot of stuff. Don't know if I like him or not. I'm trying just to see where everything goes. Right now, I just want a friend to talk to... (I call him my rebound friend) heh. It just seems that the age gap is so huge. I feel like his little sister when I talk to him.  This is all for now. Amanda is making pancakes, and I've got to get ready for work.
