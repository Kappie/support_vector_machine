It made me feel a little bit more confident and I can do a few more things from my assignment now but there is still lots I don't understand.  Luckily me dad flew in from Vancouver last night and so sometime this weekend he is going to have to help me.  He is good at math, very good cause well my mom can't do like any of my math at all.  I am trying not to let too many things get to me though.  I mean when I think about it I always WORRY WORRY WORRY.  But like what is the point about thinking about things of the past, that are over and done with and cah't be changed.  What does worrying about those do...nothing but make me miserable.  So now I am just going to look ahead to future.  What is done is done, but what has not been done yet can always been changed.  So even though I failed a chem quiz and well think I failed the other one....well I failed and that is reality that I have to life with.  On the next test I will just try my very best and that is all I can do.  I already know I put in tons of effort into doing work, trying, and understanding so I guess the rest is left up to fait.  What is meant to happen will happen, and what is not meant to happen will not happen at all.  Well yeah so friday afternoon I picked up a bagel from the Y cafe and ate it on the bus home and then dropped off my stuff and then left again to go to chapters.  Looked at some stuff their for a while and then Alex, Matt, Sarah, Ash, Thy, Travis, Raul, Lenny, and of couse myself all went to see Matrix: Revolutions.  I thought that action was awesome and stuff which is the only reason I go see those cause well I never really understood the whole story line too well.  I didn't want Trinity and Neo to die though but I guess they had to cause it was literally the end.  Actually I really liked the main quote and theme throughout the movie which was "everything that has a beginning has an end."  I like that quote alot because when you think about it, it is soooo true.  And well after the movie I was going to go to South Centre but my mother wanted to wait for a phone call from my dad cause he though he would miss his flight.  The traffic was backed up in Vancouver and well he ran for like well far and JUST like JUST made it on in like the last minute.  And well YAY!!! I finished my religion projects....!!!!  What a relief...I got up at 8 so I could get a head start on em and ya it helped.  Not I actually have some time to spare [yeah like now lol] and well I get to RELAX....now that is word I sure don't hear everyday.  Well company comes tommorow.  My Uncle is flying down from Winniepeg and we are having a big dinner tommorow with my Uncle, Dad, Grandma, Mom, Melissa, and Ben.
