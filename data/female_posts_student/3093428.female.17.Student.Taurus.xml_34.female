I was told that 8 dollars was too much money to come see me. Were paying $10 to go bowling!!!!! That's $2 more to go bowling!!! What the hell? Seriuosly!!!! I mean, sure, 8 bucks is a rip off to go see a play, but I was in it!!! None of my friends from youth or Richmond came to see me!!! I felt really bad!! And the youth could have gone to see me but $8 was too much money!!! Whats more important? Suport from friends? or Bowling in the 70's? What ever happened to good old Lowis Lanes for 5 bucks or something? (That's right, Steph knows)But really, what a way to put me down. 8 bucks is too much to see me, but it's ok to pay $10 to go bowling. Wheres The Love...Where Is The Love....
