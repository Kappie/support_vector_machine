Then we had  SAI Lunch , and that was alot of fun. I think  Dr. Goode  was amused by my  Brashier  story... If you haven't heard it, ask me sometime. Its hilarilous.   The Center for International Programs 'International Dinner'  was awesome. Every year it gets better, and this may have been the best yet. Entertainment included the international wardrobe fashion show, and Asian Martial Arts. My bosses were surprised by my "red" hair. (okay... I put a red streak in it for the formal - it looked very cool)  The  SAI Music Dept Formal  was truly awesome. If you were there, you know what I'm talking about, if you weren't there and you are in the dept, shame on you, and if you aren't in the dept and weren't invited, I'm sorry. A big hand for Martyne for planning, and Matt Elder for DJing. I hope that SAI does this again next year.  My  Birthday  party, after the formal, was definitely alot of fun. A "small" group by definition of my past parties, but it was very awesome. I had more fun Saturday (4/17) than I had had a very long time. Thanks everyone!!!  that's it for now. Peace.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
