I thought the whole idea of summer was to do nothing but watch soap operas and talk shows all day, and party all night! I guess my concept was wrong.  I am "required" to read two books by the end of summer break. One for my Honors Literature Class and another just so my school can torture students.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of reading (it is fundamental afterall), but I hate being told to read. I rather do something b/c I want to, not b/c I have to. It makes it much harder for me to read a book, knowing that I'll get tested on it when I go back to school. This summer I have to read The Count of Mounte Cristo   Picasso at the Lapin Agile: and other plays  Now, that's nothing compared to what I had to read last summer. If any of you have ever read Great Expectations you'll know the hell I had to go through. If you haven't read it don't "expect" to much from it, you'll be asleep after chapter 1. The book was so dull I could hear my hair grow, but I eventually tore all of it out from extensive boredom. Anyway I've actually already started reading Picasso at the Lapin Agile, and it's surprisingly funny. It's by the actor Steve Martin (so I was a little reluctant at first), but it's hilarious! Here's a funny quote from the play  " Sagot- I know that there are two subjects in paintings that no one will buy. One is Jesus, and the other is sheep. Love Him as much as they want, no one really wants a painting of Jesus in the living room. You're having friends over the sofa. Somehow it doesn't work. And not in the bedroom either, obviously. I mean, you want Jesus watching over you, but not while you're in the missionary position..............."  I thought it was weird that this was one of the books to choose from on the reading list, but I'm glad I picked it. Most of the girls chose "A Walk To Remember". I saw the movie, and it was just a little to "touched by an angel" for me. I mean the plot is way to Danille Steele   "weird girl" meets  "cool guy" they fall in love "cool guy" finds out that "weird girl" is dying *crying scene* cool guy" marries "weird girl" she dies we all cry THE END For some reason that story line isn't to appealing to me, wonder why? *ponders* Oh i know why, CUZ IT SUCKS!!
