If you go to your profile and choose "edit profile" at the bottom there is a random question for you to answer. If you choose "give me a new random question" and pres save profile, you will get a new question that you can read (and answer if you so choose). I would highly recommend going through all of them as some are quite funny. Oh, and when you start getting ones you've already read, keep pressing, because there are still more new ones. When you get about 5 in a row of ones that you've already read, then they are probably done. Ok, just thought I would share. Good-bye.
