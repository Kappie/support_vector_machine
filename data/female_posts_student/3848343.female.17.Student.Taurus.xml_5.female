I was gonna come late and miss out on DT casue my teacher is fucked and well i didnt want to go, BUT i was to loazy to get up late and get myself to school, if that makes any sense so instead i was kinda ready earlier and met kate and walked to school with her...  WE BEAT JESS TO THE CORNER , by like 5mins.... SO PROUD!!!.... we walked into school and joined our group which was very small to start with because the peaky girls took our guys back *gasp* lets go off and get pissed about it aye girls hahah...nah they came back quickly then all of a sudden our group was all so packed and close minus or plus a few ppl aye bridey hahaha. The day was kinda long i think until i got to Modern with Sarah and Sanja, we always have fun aye girls!.....todays lesson was different....i will give u a little run down,  SOPHIE  was chosen to explain something anyway she did and then gabby asks from across the class room and goes "can u repeat it louder" and sophie looks and goes " NO  i said u should have been listening i said it loud enough!!!" (bitchy tone) the whole class is like * gasp* , but not shocked casue well sophie always says shit liek that so i said to soph "just say it again that was really rude" she turns back around and goes "who asked me to say it again" we all go "gabby" and she goes "oh sorry i thoguht it was erin!!"(bitchy tone) at this stage i was like  *GGRRRRR*  and i said "thats it!!!, lets take it outside the room now everyone was laughing but sophie and she said "ok after class",....so of course i waited for her...she finally strolls out and im like "com' on sophie - are u trying to start me and"..and after he stating nothign when i asked what have i ever doen toher she is like "ok sure" *drops her folder ready for a fight*) ..at that stage i walk away pissed off and dumb found because  SOPHIE  was gonna take me on....LOL...the highlight of the whole thing was when Mahmoud runs back and goes " OMG PLEASE DO IT!!!... i want to see, i want to buy u lunch" - to me...hahaha...anyway im gonna forget about that moment in time untill sophie really does piss me off enough that we actually fight...evn tho it wont be fair cause i could snap her legs in half says kate hahaha.. Anyway we then had lunch which was kinda long and then i last period with ms nolan, where i did my textiles folder and took my textiels folder to the teacher, funny thing is i dont do textiles. hahah....if u had walked past our class u wouldnt have known what was happeneing, the guys playing games, girls on their phones, kim and abd singing (if u can call it that) sev, me and rowan eating and playing cards..ahaha and it was a maths lesson!...We then all met up and started our walk back to morty after school where adrian decides to tell us to not be mean to mary becasue she has feelings too etc (kinda wring coming from him cause he used to be the main guy bagging her out and also got suspended cause of her)..anyway what he said didnt stop us  'KATE, THAT WAS SO BAD'  -  'JENNY, IM SERIOUSLY PISSED OFF' , im sure she heard that but ignored us but then she was in the distance and jenny shouted  "AUSTRALIAN IDOL"  and she turned around and glared, she turned back and i laughed some loud laugh and she turned back around for some more glaring time...hahaha it was hilarious...i know ur all thinking omg ur so slack how can u bag someone out for trying, well the answer is easy, not only did she suck big time but she is a bitch and deserves everything she gets back!!!...That night me, kate, alana, and bridey all went to poulos's for movies and pizza..it was great...we watched the eviction of Big Bro first (and then ralph came and we made him unravel his lobster had ahaha to see his burns, poor kid but thats what he gets for lighting his kitchen on fire aye hahah...jksjks mwa) ( OMG I HAD TO EDIT MY BLOG TO PUT THIS IN HERE .....i got ralphs year 7 peaky ID card.....OMG FUNNY STUFF...he looked sooooooo differnt hahahaha..) and then put on Spiderman2...all i can say is ilove spiderman1 but that movie sucked  BIGTIME , it was very boring (we all agree excpet bridey) and all i can say is the only reason i stayed watching it ws because its called spiderman2 hahah i just hope the 3rd one is better!....The pizza was good but lol. Katies dad then gave us all a lift home and here i am now sitting here listeing to praise chorus - Jimmy eat world and looking at msn.     [+]decisions i need to make       school work -   should i actually start doing my assignments haha...i think i know the answer to that but i really need to pull my finger out and actually do it hahaha. and should i have dropped Extension English, once again it was a question of effort, i could have done the course but i really couldnt be bothered. Btw ms finigan told our class that we should be doing an absolute minimum of 2 hours of study a night and should be working towards fitting 4 hours in....*shock horror* i havent done that much study this whole year combined hahaha...ooops..."whos gonna fail their HSC" ====>ME      work -   i have worked at maccas and then dominos and now maccas again but i really cant stand it, i need to go and get another job, NOT one that involves fast food of any kind!!!     something else -  i duno what name to give it cause well its way to complicated. i wrote about it in yesterdays blog but yeh i still dont know what to do. Im still pissed off and cut, and i should just get over it and wel i dont want to be pissed at this thing again so i duno what to do, get over it and try or just block it out till i can totally forget about it hahah..i think i know what i should do but i dont want to be pissed off again      Design and Tech -   what the fuck should i do for my design and tech model. IF anyone has ANY ideas to improve our school cafeteria please please please let me know because basically im in shit HAHAHAH!      Netball -   We have to verse hurstville girls, we need to decide whether we actually try or just throw in the towel tomorrow cause all thats gonna happen is i will end up pissed off (remember last time we played hurstville - me and nicole)..oh well hahahah  well anyway i will leave u with some quotes      "....On my life I'll try today, thereâ€™s so much I've felt I should say, but. Even if your heart would listen, doubt I could explain. If you don't don't know, why'd you say so?...."     CHECKYAS LATERS...MWA
