This house is filled with so much stress and anger.  I am realizing that when a friend in need IS NOT a friend indeed.  And that goes for family too...  They see right past you.  It sucks.  I also should of been there for a friend from church, who like me, has been battling depression for a while.  I saw her just before Christmas but didn't catch on.  She took her life this past week.  I feel like I should of listened or called her.  Anyways, life sucks........Sorry
