After hovering around the Housing Office door and patiently (or not so patiently) awaiting our turn to make an apartment pick, we were finally able to select an apartment. Since our draw number was a lowly 20 out of 26, we had resigned ourselves to having to settle for what would obviously not be our first choice apartment.  Amazingly, everyone and their mother wanted to live in Tower I and didn't really care about move-in dates, so Melissa and I were able to snag one of the two apartments we wanted. The earliest lease start date is 06/1/2004, so that means that I will be living Tower-style in the summer. No more Bard, baby!
