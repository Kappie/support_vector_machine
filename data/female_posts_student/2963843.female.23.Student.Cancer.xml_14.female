There was this really noisy malay couple with 2 kids on the bus stop Both of them had tattoos on their bodies and looked pretty young to have so many children.. The kids were acting like the little rascals... which made my phobia to have kids even stronger...  Eeks! but I gotta have kids one day don't I?  Anyway its more 'profitable' to be married and have kids in Singapore nowadays than be single! Check out all the benefits and paid leave.. Poor singles would have to slog it out while the other happy mothers take their leave to give birth ... ;while the workload is piled up on the singles, working late and being stressed out.. Worse still.. nobody actually feels sorry for them..  who ask them? go n reproduce la! haha... I dunno which side I'm gonna be on... Me going to pray that there's someone willing to sign the 'contract' for life with me..=p  Although the malay couple looked poor to me and totally stressed out... The mother has this really washed out and sian face most mothers have... But she seem to be happy.. When the hubby looked and smiled at his wife while their baby gal made faces at the other passengers and was creating havoc with her brother.. I can see the love oozing out when they looked at each other man.. They look so proud that they had produced this gem from their love.. To them la... To the others the little gal was like an irritant or a bad itchy rash.. Most of the passengers were having post monday blues as it was sunday nite n most wanted to sleep on the bus.. Isn't that what life is about?  Love? instead of money money and money? Call me a dreamer but just let me be that for today.. What the hell.. I'm tired so i'm going to dream now.. Oh me goodness I'm so lame...  K nite blog..
