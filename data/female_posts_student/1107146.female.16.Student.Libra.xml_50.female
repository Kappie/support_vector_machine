You've been telling me since day one and you expect me not to try to find the real you? I've been trying ever since but apparently you don't see that. I never thought that we would ever fight over the true you or even Leigh. She was there for you, to help you but sometimes she wasn't there. I wanted to talk to her about that. I have no sorries to give. Leigh is as she is and I supposed that you see her life with yours. Enjoy. I cared about you Joah and since you never want us to be friends apparently I have to say bye.
