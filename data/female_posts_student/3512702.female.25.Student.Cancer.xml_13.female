Sometimes, I wonder, what's the point of being in love with anyone in the world..When you are just gone be judged or hurt or betrayed or whatever. Its not fair at all if you ask me. Especially when you love someone with your whole being..Ha that's like walking into a live mine field. The biggest shocker of them all is to have someone not want to answer a question that should so simple to answer. The fact that they don't leads the other one to believe that things are not good and then fear sets in..And stays there until further notice. And really..I cant count how many times I've been reassured yet w/in a day or 2 I'm back to the same predicament. I just really don't understand. I was told I am over dramatic and that sunk into me and burned all the way in. I am me..Take it or leave it.Who is anyone in this world to say how a person should react to anything? We all have our own feelings, our own comfort zones and our own way of dealing and observing things in life. I myself would never down a person for dealing how they deal. Granted I may tell one to relax or remain calm yet I'd never say "hey you..you need to grow up and stop being so overdramatic" Caring is one thing but care and practical insults do not go hand in hand. That's like back when most of us were kids and we were spanked or beat and it was always.."We do that cuz we love you"-Crap..Well I'm sorry but that is really backwards. I am entitled to say that because that is my opinion. Love should be all about total understanding, faith and support. That, along with other things but those are most important to me. Also a love that is mutual...What good is putting your whole entire heart and soul on the line when in the end you find out you weren't loved as much..That that love you expressed and found so true was in fact the killer in the relationship? God what a horrible feeling. I'm very afraid that at this point in a certain relationship of mine that- that is just the case indeed. I ask, is it in fact true and I get no answer except confusion from beyond so what am I supposed to think world..What the hell am I supposed to think:( ?? A person can only go thru so much till they just are flat out scared of the inevitable. A person can only ask once to be loved in the same way they give themselves.
