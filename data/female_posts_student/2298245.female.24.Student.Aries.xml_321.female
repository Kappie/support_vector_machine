Even less rarely do I read reviews of movies I have no desire to see.  And before reading this, I must admit I had no burning plans to rush out and see this film.  I felt largely ambivalent about it, despite my love of Westerns, and this was driven by something Mr. Hulsey describes in his review:   Meanwhile, Republican red-staters hear the filmmakers' statements about "historical accuracy," and grit their teeth: The left-wing revisionists are at it again. Allen Barra, writing for the online magazine Salon, expresses the hope that today's historical epics can take pesky pro-American sentiment down a peg: "The dark side of these cowboy heroes depicted in ... 'The Alamo' are [sic] just what America needs to see today." Conservatives hear those words and cringe: They know that a financially successful film which venerates General Santa Anna and execrates the historical Texians could ruin a vital American myth for an entire generation. Of course, a film that abandons history for mindless action violence would prove no less destructive to America's self-esteem.   I like the Western myths.  They are something uniquely American, and they make great movies. And while I am not saying that the myths should remain unquestioned and continue blaring on through all eternity as gospel truth, I do think that they have their place, and should be treated at least with something bordering on critical respect.  To get an idea of what I mean, rent  The Searchers  and Once  Upon a Time in the West .  There you will see nostalgia mixed in with the gritty reality, almost a sad and reluctant letting go of the myths of the West.  But Hulsey, a self proclaimed conservative himself, provides ample justification for seeing the film, and calms my fears about that a little:     Fortunately, we conservatives have every reason to rejoice at The Alamo. Unlike Disney's bewildered marketing department, this film knows precisely what it is and what it intends to do. Not for a single moment does it deviate from its course or pander to its audience. There are two brief, intense battle sequences -- one at the Alamo, one at San Jacinto -- in which the gore is almost entirely suggested. But for the most part, this particular epic is concerned with discussions, not concussions. We learn why the people of Texas went to war with Mexico, and their reasons should hearten today's conservatives: The Texians wish to force a sudden regime change on General Santa Anna, who has replaced Mexico's constitutional republic with a despotic tyranny. (Does this conflict sound at all familiar?)   In fact, his entire description of the film makes it sound just like those Westerns that I have come to know and love.  It does not seem to buy into an easy view of the situation from either perspective, not painting anyone in a particularly flattering light, and yet, at the same time, clearly coming down on the right side of the events.  Everyone should trek on over the his blog and read the entire review.  His reviews are always worth reading, and this one, unlike most I've ever read, actually leaves me wanting to see the movie.  Well, that and the presence of Dennis Quaid doesn't do much to hurt, either.  So perhaps I will be carving some time out of my hectic exam preparation schedule to go and see this film.  And when I do, I think I will not be disappointed.
