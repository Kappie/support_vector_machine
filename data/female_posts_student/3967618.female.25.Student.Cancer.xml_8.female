VRC:  I had never looked at myself - I had never put myself together.  It's like having your hands tied behind your back and trying to do something useful ... At the most simple level, the more you're caught up with attachment and anger and fear ... the more limited you are in your capacity to even see others, much less help them...when you go beyond that ...then your capacity for compassion is limitless.  VRC: Buddha would say at the deepest level we are all - each of us individually and collectively - literally creators of our universe.  VRC:  We have this very extreme tendency to paint a person with one brush.  They do one bad action and we see the whole person as bad - we define them as bad.  We do that to each other all the time, and we do it to ourselves.  We do certain things that are wrong, so we walk around with self-hate and guilt...  ...The whole Buddhist approach is that we have to be more realistic in seeing ourselves, more humble in owning our negative qualities without feeling guilty, more brave to know we can change them and more optimistic about our good qualities, which will help us move toward them.
