I was like coughing up mucus before it was kinda like gross cause it was like my nose was running out of my mouth... wow no one is eva gonna wanna kiss me again afta that one.... But yeah, I'm kinda jazzed up on NyQuil, if thats possible cause NyQuil is supposed to un-jazz a person but oh well.. my lifes one big oxymoron (and a regular moron too, just for the hell of it). This weekend wasn't too bad. Friday I went to see  The Ladykillers  with Fea and Melca. It wasn't too bad. Fea in all his racistness kept wishing the old back lady would just get shot already and Melca ate "Poppums", not sure which ones though, think they were Snickers. And GOD DAMIT MY DASHBOARD CD KEEPS SKIPPING!!!!!!!!!! Sorry... So yeah, more about my weekend. Saturday was our first outdoor meet which didn't go over too bad. I ran the first 100 I ever ran before in my life, and we didn't do too bad, 3rd in our heat I think. Our handoffs kicked ass. Then I went to the "Luau" at my school. I think that was like the WORST "luau" in the history of all "luau"'s. I mean really, if thats the way a "luau" is supposed to be then I will never go to another "luau" again...... EVER. I mean, besides playing outdated hip-hop the other musical choice was music that you should be on Acid to... then the auction was gay cause no one wanted to seem so desprit as to pay money to make someone hang out with them, then I didn't win the raffle so that just added to my mal content. Then on Sunday I went to the city with my mom and Joe. I think this was like the WORST Sunday in the history of all Sunday's. I mean really, if thats the way a Sudnay is supposed to be then I will never go to another Sunday again...... EVER... wait... well you know what I mean. But seriously, this was God's way at getting back at me for not going to church in months. Joe had asked me to look in his jacket pocket for the tickets to the show we were going to see (" Fame "... should be renamed " Gay Men Trying to Act Straight for the Viewing Pleasure of an Audience "). So I'm like, alright, so I put my hand in the pocket and I don't feel tickets but I do feel paper, so I took out what was in the pocket and lo and behold...  2  not  1   but  2  Trojan condoms [ waits a minute for this information to sink in ] I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF... JUST JUMP OUT OF THE CAR INTO ONGOING TRAFFIC AND THEN MUSTER UP ENOUGH STRENGTH TO THROW MY SELF IN FRONT OF A BUS Have I stressed enough how much I wanted to die? And then it got even better when they started to make sexual inuendos towards eachother I was like "Oh my GOD... earmuffs, earmuffs... GOD DAMIT WHY ISN'T IT WORKING!!!!!!!" So yeah, that was my weekend.... don't you just so0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o want to be me? x0x
