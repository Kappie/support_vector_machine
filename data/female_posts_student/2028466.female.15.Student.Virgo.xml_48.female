I can only hope, even though I have tried, to see if I can find someone to heal my pain inside. All of my friends seem to have someone. All my hoping is killing me, I just want to be set free, from my aching heart. It's tearing me apart when I'm with you, When I see you, I wish it were true. Why can't we be the ones holding hands? My tears fall freely, like the rain outside, My emotions I do hide. No one knows the pain I feel insdie, It makes me want to cry, These dark feelings insdie. Please, don't let my heart die! The sight of you keeps me alive, My emotions spin around like a beehive. Guide me, tell me waht to do. My mind is full of hope, I don't think I'll be able to cope. I only survive because of you, But it would be better if my dreams could come true. Guide me, help me, tell me what to do, Because I am nothing without you!   yeah, on this one...i sorta had a big crush on someone, and im not saying any names..but yea, cuz someone told me something, then they told him something they wernt supposed to, then i heard something else, so i was sorta unsure...but yea
