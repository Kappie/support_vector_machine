Everyone may think "Go for it" but there are unseen conditions that could make things harder. I have been thinking about this for about two days now, and I still have not come up with a conclusion. Everytime I run thesituation through my head, it would always lead be back to where I started. So, I am still unsure if I want to date this person or just stay friends. I think I need a lot more time to run this through my head. I hope she is not expecting an answer anytime soon.
