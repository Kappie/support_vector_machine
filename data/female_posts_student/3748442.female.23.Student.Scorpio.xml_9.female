Being the "Read Along" music listener that I am, I actually knew the correct lyrics to "Alive" but some people at  urlLink this site  didn't. They also thought that in Eddie's poetic "Black" he was saying  queafs of envied pandas  when the song actually says  sheets of emptied canvas  (or something along those lines).   But I am no lyrics genius. Many times in my life I have shamelessly danced around the house feeling empowered while jamming to Aretha Franklin's "Respect." And I always thought she said:  you're runnin' outta food, and I ain't lyin' . I mean, it makes sense, right? If her man doesn't shape up and stop disrespectin', Aretha's gonna cut off his supply of pork chops and mashed potatoes, right? WRONG. It's  you're runnin' out of foolin' . Well, who knew. I didn't know "foolin'" was sumthin people run out of.   So, confession time: what have YOU misheard??
