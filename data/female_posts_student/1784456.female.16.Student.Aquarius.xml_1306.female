Now what's that clever word that I should -but don't- know? Lo siento, guess I'm going mad!  When I was younger, Heaven was so weird to me. Surely it must be full by now, Will there be room for me? Who gets to decide who goes to hell? Will I go there instead? So it's the creator that destroys what he created, Surely no one should have that power. But then he is god.  Now I am older, And heaven doesn't seem so weird to me. Because I have found it, Here on Earth. And I think I'll stay instead.  Yes... mad. I've got kind of stuck on this song by S.E.S called Dreams Come True, but hell it's in Japanese and I can't find it any where! :'(
