The fog machine set off the fire alarm so we all had to go outside.. It was kinda funny. Then Marianne dumped her water bottle on the floor and I took a step and slipper on bonked my head on a stair. It hurt so stinking bad. I couldn't breathe for like 30 seconds and I thought I was going to die.  My back stil hurts really bad and I can bareley move it...  Oh how I loathe high school dances!! I was exposed to way more stuff than I was like my first 9 years. :)
