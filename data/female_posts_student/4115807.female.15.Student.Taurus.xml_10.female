Well, my parents don't know yet which is cool, ummm my life is kinda(as ashleigh would say) Blah right now. It's just so stupid that whatever we(teenagers) do, they(the parents/teachers) think it's for attention or that we have some major problem and that medication is going to fix it. Grrr!!!! I hate this...Bye
