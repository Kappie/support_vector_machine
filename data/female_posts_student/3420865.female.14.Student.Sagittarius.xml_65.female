"you're so much more confident than you used to be."-my mum "yeah. i've been more confident since i've been friends with erin."-me "yeah. erin's been good for you."-my mum  aww. how cute. even my mum has noticed a change in me since erin. wow.  so i guess what i'm trying to say, is that i don't even want to think about what i'd be like without erin. she's always thurr to give me advice, and always knows what to do in a situation. [i love you, erin.]   say you won't care.   kayte.
