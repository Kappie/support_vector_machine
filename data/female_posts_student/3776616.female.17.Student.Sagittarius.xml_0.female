I'm just...  I don't even really know what I want to say... I'm sick of everything.  I'm sick of having to lie for people, even when I know it's wrong.  I'm sick of doing what's right and being reprimanded and shut out by my friends. And most of all, I'm sick of telling the truth and hurting people.  I sick of watching people suffer, even when I know that what I'm doing is right.  I'm so tired of hurting and crying myself to sleep every night because I hurt someone, all the while not accepting that was I did was right in the long run, not wanting to accept that sometimes the happiest way isn't the best way. Life  ISN'T  fair, there's no getting around that fact...   I'm sick of fighting with my friends and hurting them, I'm sick of backstabbing and secret telling, I'm sick of fighting with my sister and my parents, I'm sick of listening to my parents fight, or having to listen to them bitch about each other, and I'm sick of having to hurt the person I love most in this fucked up world. Most of all, I'm sick of lying to myself, sick of convincing myself that eventually everything will be ok, I just have to work out a little problem right now.  I'm sick of not accepting the fact that before that problem is even gone another one is on the way, and tha my whole life will be like that, problem after problem piling up on each other until I can't take it anymore.  Of course, I have my 'Get Out of Jail Free' card -- college -- but how much good will that do?  Sure, I'm starting over, wiping the slate clean, and leaving behind this life, but what happens then?  I mean, I can't completely start over, because I'll always have links back to here -- a few of my true friends, and the fact that I can't completely abandon my family.  And what kind of disillusioned fantasy world would I be living in if I told myself that problems will never start up while I'm at college??  It's like that stupid saying "You can run, but you can't hide."  But it's true.  Sure, you can run from your problems for awhile, but eventually everything's going to catch back up to you...  And what can you do about it?    And now, with everything that's going on in my life... I don't know what to do.  I don't know who I can trust or confide on.  I don't even know if it's possible for me to trust anyone...  I can't talk to my parents...  They're always too busy, and they would never listen anyway.  God forbid they take a moment away from the computer or TV to listen to me...  I can't stand being around them anyway.  When they're both home they're usually complaining or fighting about something, and if I'm ever alone with one of them they're usually bitching about the other one.  Every car ride or shopping trip is like a campaign to get me on one of their sides, and I can't take it anymore.  I want more than anything to be out of this house.  Away from the fighting, away from my sister, away from all the comments about my laziness and how I never do anything around the house.  I'm sick of feeling ungratefull because I want to have a friend over instead of me going to other people's houses.  I'm sick of everyone getting pissed off because I want to take the car to pick up a friend, of getting told no just because I wouldn't go pick up my sister from somewhere last time they asked...  and then there's my friends.  I'm not sure who is siding with who, who will tell so-and-so, or who'll keep everything a secret.  I don't know who's going behind my back and repeating everything I say to someone else, or who secretly hates me but just puts up with me for their own benefit.  I just don't know anything anymore, and I'm scared, and I don't know what to do...  Bethany... I didn't tell her  ANY  of the Ken stuff, and I don't really know why.  I feel like I'm losing her somehow, like she's slipping away from me.  And that scares me more than you'll ever know, because I've already lost too many friends since I started high school, and I can't take losing another one...  And then there's Ken... there's only so much I can talk to him about, because a lot of my current issues involve him...  Which is hard to tell Bethany, because she's never been in a relationship before so she doens't really understand everything.  Lainie's been pretty helpful, and Mande.  And of course Sam, because he shows me things from a guy's perspective.  I just... I don't know.  Every time I think I can confide in someone something happens to fuck it all up...  And now all I truly have is my journal and my blog, and I know from emperience that those things can fall into the wrong hands...  Written words provide tangible evidence, which can be used against you in more ways than you ever thought possible.  Everything just comes back to bite you in the ass...   I don't know... I don't have the energy to write anymore right now.  So I'll just call this 'Part I'
