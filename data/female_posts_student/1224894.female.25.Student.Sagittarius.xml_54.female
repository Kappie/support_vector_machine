Well, i'm working for a Congressman in our place and studying nursing at the same time, hoping to land in a job in the States. Anyway, about my day, it's not really good since i'm nursing a flu and woke up late...but then, when i logged on, i saw JR, the good friend who never misses a chance to make me smile. Hope that i'll be able to rest later and able to study tonight for exams tomorrow. I'm starting to feel better...till next time...
