I have been desperately trying to coax the few artistic brain cells I do have to put together a scrapbook.  Yeah, right, a scrapbook.  I do have a lot of crap in a big box from the last few years.  Does that count for anything? I also put my entire schedule so-far thru December online.  Public viewing, too, which I know is weird but, hey, now no one can complain that I am just being lazy.  Just look at my calendar.  Busy ALL around. Here is a copy of an email I sent out in a liberal rage:  Dear Concerned Friends,  On July 4th, 2004, in the Tribune papers, a man named Johnny Hart published yet another "B.C." comic strip cartoon.  Many of you, as I have in the past, may enjoy his work in "B.C." and "Wizard of Id", two of his creations.  However, this particular cartoon was quite disturbing- it insinuates that eliminating "under God" while saying the pledge in school literally "destroys" the flag.  I encourage all of you to visit www.creators.com and go to the "B.C." comic strip for July 4th to view the comic, then pass this on to your friends.  In the 1990's, Johnny Hart came under great criticism for his increasingly Christian undertones and blatant religious statements in his strips.  It is time to once more recognize the subliminal messages his strip forces into the minds of America's youth, who are supposedly enjoying the humorous and careless portion on the newspaper.  It is time to stop reading hidden religious nonsense and to begin to pay attention to the REAL NEWS in the newspapers, like bloody death in war and the problems in America.  Thank you for your time and concern.  Hillary Z. Blank  --------  If you all would comment, it would be nice.  I like to hear other people type every once in awhile. :)
