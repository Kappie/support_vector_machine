Now, I'm not saying they were TRYING to be dirty or sexual with it, but GOD it sounds like it! Turn your dirty minds on and read..   ONE PHWAP OR TWO?   It's easy to find beauty in the world, if you know where to look. We find it in the phwap, our word (noun or verb) for the dramatic yet graceful release of a spoonful of extra richness onto  your welcoming burrito.  This seemingly careless yet cultivated flick of the wrist is the product of hundreds of hours of practice, building thousands of burritos. It demands a light touch with 100% pure sour cream and a more energetic, even aggressive flip when applying the green gold of our freshly made guacamole.  Placement of the said stuff, of course is key; always satisfyingly centered for perfect flavor distribution. But it is the swiftness and delightful nonchalance of the movement that elevates the phwap from mere "spooning."  As always, we encourage you to customize your burrito, perhaps with a heavier, lighter or even a second phwap. Your servers are glad to  oblige. And as they do, we hope you'll appreciate the fine art of phwappage.  Okay so, what do you guys think? I'm sorry, but it just sounds a little fishy to me! Anyways.. School was pretty good today. It was only until noon so it wasn't too long or too boring. It was my last day of class with Mrs. Ingram, Mr. Metcalf, Mr. Ice, Ms. Langley, and Mr. Beam. How sad? It is a little bit sad. Oh well, They have a good class coming up next year! And good bye to Mrs. Ingram and Mr. Ice. I hope they'll be happy in their retirement. I'll miss them.   I went to the Pre-calculus review today. Mr. Beam wants me to get an A++ on this test in order to raise my Second Semester average up to an A- but i really don't think that is going to happen. If it doesn't, it will be no big deal, B+? I'm definitely happy with that. But i really do need to do well on it. I need to focus on history for now. Basically all i can do is take the tests on my APCD and um.. hope? Yeah, that's all. I remember the structure of DBQ so i'll do just fine!  COMING UP!  Wednesday, May 26, 2004 8:00-9:45 Take Euro final! oh goodness 10:00 Sarah picks me up 10:00-1:00 Go eat at Chili's maybe and then go return her converse at Parks mall  Thursday, May 27, 2004 8:00-9:45 Take Pre-cal final!  10:00 Mom comes to pick me up 12:00 Sarah picks me up 12:00-5:30ish swim at Sarah's and eat some more! yay, hehe  That's pretty much all i know from this week so far. I really should go start studying for my history final. All of the AP European takers are very happy that they don't have any school tomorrow! I, for one, did not take it and now I suffer the consequences. Oh well, I'm willing to do it. It's not too bad for me.  I hope everyone has a great day and a great night! I'll post some more later. Bye everyone! *kisses* to Sarah!
