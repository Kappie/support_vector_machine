I have written some really good ones..and some really bad ones. This one that I am willing to share. It is about a guy..of course..and hopefully I tell this guy how I feel about him..soon..but we'll see...anyways here another stupid poem  "Feelings of many kinds" The air is clear tonight, but somehow I'm breathless. Emotions and feelings are overwhelming and making me restless. How can I tell if what I'm feeling is real? I've been immuned to rejection, and my soul can not feel. I'm scared of what I'm getting myself into. Afraid that you won't feel the same way too. I'm taking my time, but time goes so fast. Any chance I have being with you might not last. I get confused by your signs. I wonder if our thoughts are aligned. Please tell me that my worries are wrong. Tell me that you loved me along. I know it's wishful thinking, but then again I might be right by what I'm dreaming. Between us, I can feel some heat. When I see you, my heart skips a beat. When I look in your eyes, my heart can melt. I'm wondering when you see mine, how you felt. I'm putting my heart on the floor. I'm hoping that our friendshipe mean more. You are like a shooting star, because with you my heart can go far!
