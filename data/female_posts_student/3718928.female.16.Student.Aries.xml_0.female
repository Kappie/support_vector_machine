Speaking of good times last night was great! Katy, Braden, Mike, and I went to see The Village, I dunno after seeing it I don't think it was scary at all, but during the movie, I'll admitt that Katy and I were hidding under my sweatshirt for a lot the scary parts but then in the end you're like what the f*?  Yeah but still it was fun because Braden and Mike were being halarious, I still don't understand what they were going on about with the leprachauns... ehhh who knows? After that we went to oberwise and katy and braden sucked in some helium and talked like the munchkins from wizard of oz... and then braden put a ballon under his shirt and just walked out... a little strange but whatever... then the most enlightening experiance of the evening.... Everyone  went  with me to the gas station and showed me how to fill up the gas in the car, because I had no idea- kind of pathetic but what can you do?  Well, I must say Katy has got skills because she got it exactly on 5 dollars, which was all I felt like filling it up - just enough so I could get home (I figure my brother can fill it up all the way later).  Ahh I still can't believe I finally got my license! Its pretty exciting for like 5 days and now it is wearing off...  Yep well thats about it, I really have no idea if I'll ever post again but I will probably just because I get bored easily.    much love *T*
