Any regular job my husband wouldn't be working 15 f*%$in' hours and not get paid for the hours after 8 hours.  Not to mention the other 5 frickin' hours he will probably work when he gets home.  An what other frickin' job will send you on a frickin' business trip for 7-9 months in the frickin' desert with crazy people trying to kill you.  So when these people who think we get off by getting all ther "extras" none of those "extras" amount to the hours of dedication and loyalty that our spouses or family members devote to their job.  Shamefully there are people there who don't appreciate the hardships that WE military families face.  I am annoyed and heated with stupid comments on how cool it is that my husband gets housing allowance and cans hop tax free at the commissary and exchange...(by the way, the commissary may not tax, but there is some service charge of some sort at the end of my bill and then the tips for baggers...so how much am I really saving...probably still some, but not the outrageous amounts others may think.  Yes readers, I am PISSED OFF because our lives aren't easy.  I hate that my husband works awful hours.  I hate that he will be going to a land where there are more than a handful of people wanting to kill him and his comrades, I hate that my children will have to go without their father for 7-9 months, I hate that I will have to be the only parent for that amount of time....but I LOVE my husband and I AM VERY PROUD of his career in the Navy.  I just wish people would stop making stupid comments.  Okay, I will end at this.  Thank goodness for our trip to Legoland tomorrow...maybe my blood will stop boiling.  Oh hey, I have a new reader...Riss (a friend of an old friend from college).  WElcome to my madness Riss and thanks for the uplifting comments.  =)
