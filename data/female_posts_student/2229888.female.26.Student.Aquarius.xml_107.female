I took care of gayle's kids tonight, so she and her husband could go to a church meeting and out to dinnner for the first time in forever. the kids were really good up until the last part of the night. then the boys started being loud.  I had just put sky to bed, so i told them to be quiet. they didn't listen, and i told htem again. then i said"if you are loud one more time, you are going to bed."  well, they were loud one more time, so i sent them to bed. the first thing the oldest did, is call his mom and tell her it wasn't fair. (he always does that and it drives me bonkers) of course she said to do as toni says, and they went to bed. boy were they mad at me! they didn't even want to hear a funny story which is one of their favorite things.  honestly, it made me feel kinda bad, but i know i have to stick to what i say. i was really trying to make tonight fun, and it was up until that point. well, i stuck to my guns, and eventually, the boys apologized and we talked it out. then i told them a few stories and they went to sleep.  i went to bed after gayle and jon got home.  i slept okay until my throat really started hurting, and i started coughing up a some blood. (which is normal) i went back to bed at 12 then woke up at 2 something cuz sky was crying and had gas. gave him medicine. went back to bed. woke upwith sky again at 3 something and stayed up... lol
