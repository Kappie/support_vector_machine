He's just a family friend, but he's a really cool old guy.  He's gay and its too bad that some people have problems with gay people cuz he is one of the coolest persons ever.   He said he's comin into town next saturday!  yay!  leaves sunday, but thats ok.  It's his birthday today and he's all alone, so we had a good talk.  Happy Birthday kid!  Other than that the day has been pretty uneventful.  Michelle and i went to goosetown though so that was good!  and then i went to work... hooraw.   Last night was pretty cool though.  Leslie and i made a cool slide show- its pretty schweet.   Then i took a hot tub and it was the coolest- i saw 21 shooting stars!  Who sees 21 shooting stars in one night, honestly.  but i did.  i was out there for about 2 hrs though.  but it was good.  well mostly.  i started thinking though- cuz there was nothing else to do besides think and enjoy the water.  when i start to think its scary.  i dont like thinking and reflecting.   i psych myself out.  The shit that goes through my head made me sad but i couldnt stop thinking - damnit i hate when that happens.  its different if youre thinking about something but its when youre thinking about nothing that anything can make its way through your brain, like how pointless you are and that you havent done anything youve set out to do or anything at all for that matter.  Point being i dont like thinking about nothing and maybe thats why i watch so much TV when im home... i get to think about what other people have already thought about and therefore make no challenge to myself.  but yeah.  Erik came to the show tonight. i didnt know waht to say to him so i didnt say anything really just made small talk when i should have been telling him that i just want to be friends -grr i still hate that phrase and the fact that i, of all people, will have to use it.  Hmm what else to say to the internet gods..... I cant think of anything.  So perhaps i shall depart.  Until Time Next
