I miss being able to communicate with people, other than thank you, yes, and hand gestures.  It is nice over here though, and I know I'm not going to want to go home when it comes time, because I've made good friends in the week I've been here.     What has been happening in our little hometown? Same as always? Not too much?  I should really get going, we have to leave for Ooshgarad(I haven't learned how to spell in Ukrainian yet either, they have a different alphabet than us.)  We're going for church, and my aunt is teaching.  Love and miss you all.  Talk to you soon. ~Amanda
