Their was this Dip sign on 32nd street that some kids vandalized and wrote shit on the bottom so it read, "dip shit" Renae and I thought that was so funny and it needed to be remembered.  Needless to say I took the picture with her in it.  So maybe if you squint real hard you can see the word shit painted on, but the glowing of the sign makes it a bit hard on the computer. urlLink
