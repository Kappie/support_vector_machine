I was intending to go to Boston this weekend and put some of my anxiety to rest but unfortunately for me the snow made it impossible to make it there and back in a timely manner so here I am at my computer on a Sunday when I should be on my way back from Boston.  Telle est la vie.  But I guess the new plan is to make the run next weekend.  I feel bad cause I have to completely rearrange plans but I need to see my new home.  I am honestly getting very scared right now and my anxiety attacks are coming on a regular basis.  So I think going up there and seeing my new home and where I'll be living will be really great for me and maybe help to calm my nerves just a bit.  So I will try and keep up with this thing a little better to keep you all informed of this major change in my life.  I know that people have been complaining that there haven't been too many updates recently and this is their everyday link into my life.  So I promise to try harder.
