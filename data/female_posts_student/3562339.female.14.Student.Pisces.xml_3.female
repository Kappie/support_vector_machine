The final guest list pretty much is:  Dot, Mia, Sam, Jen, Rachel Fink, Amy, Maggie, S'rah, Sophie, Tim, Faich, Jamie, and Ben Fraimow  Since that's only 13 people, I may be making more calls tomorrow.  Stinky Alicia will still be at the shore for the party.  Grrr.  Anyways, I didn't really do much today other than discover like the bestest game ever, thanks to Dot.  It's called " urlLink Avatar High ", and it's kind of like the Sims online.  You make a highschool with 8 students and basically control what they do and who they have a crush on.  All the while they're also controlling themselves and making more crushes and relationships, and doing random stuff.  It's really fun, but it like uses up all of the memory on my laptop so I have to restart like ever 20 minutes.  I'm addicted.  Also, earlier today, I went to Suburban Square with Mia, and I got a shirt from Express, and some really pretty chrome nail polish.  It was fun.  I'm going to camp soon so I'm going to the mall tomorrow to buy stuff before the party.  Yay for the mall!  And then the next day, I'm going to Britta's birthday party and I'm in Sam's group.  We're going to dress up as the Spice Girls to get extra money, lol.  It's a scavenger hunt and we only get $20 to start out, so we need to do whatever we can to get more money, since there are 100 items.  Then I have a day to pack before I'm going to John Hopkins CTY (Center for Talented Youth) camp thingy in Saint Mary's City, Maryland, for three weeks.  I'll miss you guys!  (And I'm sure you'll miss me too)  I think I might die without internet.  Bleh.  ...la Gu
