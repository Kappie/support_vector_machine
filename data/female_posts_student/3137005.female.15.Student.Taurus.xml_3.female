Thankyou Second, OMG they have changed the format of my blogging write page thing. It's cool!!!!! Third, Kirsty, outstanding choice for entry song of the day! Right that's about it now for the real bloggy bit. Though of the day 'I have a minor obsession with stars'). Seriously! Think about it, look at this list of some of my fav songs. hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me -U2 (you're a star') Electrolite- Rem ('You are a star tonight') Yellow- Coldplay ('look at the stars, look how they shine for you') that one that goes she's a star Golden years and Smooth though technically not about stars do refer to bright shiny things! Like gold and the moon! oh and diamonds are a girls best friend...sparkly much? and though not my one of my fav songs I really like the bit in all STAR, when they go  'And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mould' It's worrying really! I feel like smudge, who is a magpie masquerading as a feline, in order to steal all my shiny things (e.g. jewelry), I caught her trying to eat my snake ring yesterday. Then again she does also eat paint, and paper, and orangeskins, well anything that will stay still long enough really, this includes your feet in the middle of the night too. Why on earth did I get rescue cats, why????? They're insane, I mean shadow is staring at the bloody flashy thing on the typy box now. what was I talking about????? Oh right yeah , oh here we are, an ode to my insanity and obsession with stars. My very own little star.....fish. Maybe I could name one, a star not the fishy one, I'd like that...hmmmmm     oh and before I forget DANI IS GETTING ME THE SHAMPOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUY IT NOT!!!!!!!!!!!! Though I have been telling ppl all week so you better have got the pic by now. Anyways I'm bored now byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!
