You love storms, nature, and prefer to be alone. In your eyes there is nothing wrong with you... if the rest of the world can't understand you, then that is their own problem. They all have a hard time reading you and you have no time or patience to let them decipher you. You have an 'eternally' strong spirit and try not to let others bring you down, though it's hard at times because you're not as tough as your exterior leads people to believe. Despite this and your frustration in other's ignorance, you are beautifully talented person with a great personality. Those who know you well, know this. You tend to hang with the 'creative' type of people who feel the same as you do.  *Please Rate*    urlLink   Which Evanescence 'Origin' Song Are You?
