I passed the portfolio... sooo next comes the apptitude test... (but blah its 2 hours long) hehe... I'm just bouncing around super excited that they finally called. Released a lot of tension. Now I have to worry about passing Math!  Creative Writing Portfolio is due tomorrow. Ick. Gotta start typing that thing out. (For my final assignment I'm using the Mists story, hope no one has any arguments. I'll put it up on the web for you guys some time!)  On a serious high just from one phone call... but ooh well!  Wrote my Social essay exam today, it sucked but... I don't care! I think this may even inspire me to study Math for tomorrow! (Operative word there... -may-)  That's All!
