I'm both excited and nervous.  Of course, I'm plagued with all the "what if's..." and I'm prepared for disappointment, but he seems genuinely sweet in his emails.  I've been disappointed with Match.com EYF's four times now.  All seemed like decent guys with potential...then things go wrong and I realize they're idiots.  Hell, maybe it could work this time.  We do have tons in common and he's interested in the works of Leonard Cohen--that certaintly doesn't hurt.
