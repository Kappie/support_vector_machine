I wonder where my neurotic - isms come from?  but how amusing that I know this is what I could be subjected to and this is what I could end up feeling, and that it should be temporary now that "I know better", but it's still my pops, his approval matters so much...  You know I can't be around too much perfection because of this guy.  The more decrepid, confusing, unorganized, or desheveled something is, the more solace I find in it.  I want to see people's faults and love them for it, but who can love faults right...swindled again..I still end up being the complainer of all that is not what I expect, meaning I let people be themselves, one of the least judgemental people around but then when they fall short of some weird overachiever psychic expectation, I act like I didn't know getting tied to the traintracks might end up getting you run over, so really it's a big trick, as a wise he always says...  And..to top it all off, I'm the biggest hater of flawless game ever...like the Indian girl who is smart, Spiritual AND RELIGIOUS, perfectly blended with Eastern and Western values like an Ohm printed on a Billabong shirt, who doesn't drink or smoke, who is athletic, socially apt, and in medical school, well...i wish she would combust too (see previous entry)..because damnit, I have worked too long and hard at not being any of these things, suffered hard stares from many an Indian socialite and spent way too much time in school to make myself infamous to have it all washed away like a sand castle at high tide...I am always trying to make the simple point that "outside the box" is way cooler than inside the square..
