John got into trouble and then we decided I was going to sneak over to his house and we got caught so now I'm grounded. It really blows. But yeah, my 4th sucked too, because I was grounded. Oh well, there's nothing I can do about it now. I've just got to deal with it. I think I'm going to go get my license soon! I can't wait, I have this old white beat up car, that we're fixing up, but hey, I dont care. its a car, and it drives!!!!!! But Im going to go now. Love ya'll. Talk to you soon! ~*CaSeY*~  ***Always look on the bright side***
