But a drama-less life means less to blog about, less to talk about, etc.  Right now all that is going on is finals.  Whee.    Well, 24 hours until I get the final word on India.  But she hadn't heard anything as of about 4:00 this afternoon, so that certainly seems a bad sign.    I'm meeting with various faculty members to talk about "life" on Monday morning.  Fun.  Time to come up with a prelim paper topic, break it to Carla that I'm going to do the Paleolithic for my dissertation, etc.    I've been suckered into taking a 4th class next semester.  I suppose that will help keep me busy, though, which is nice.  Of course, what with leaving early an all, I will be insane-o busy come late March.      I went to Vail today.  Not Colorado, but the co-op.  I was hanging out with Adam.  He tried to make me eat.  He claims I look like I'm from a third world country.  I'm not really that skinny, am I?  We watched some X-Files, and then I had to come home and work.  He invited me to come by and eat whenever I want.  I should take him up on that.   Well, maybe not the eating, but the visiting.  He's a lot like my little brother, but cooler.  I like my adopted brothers (okay, I only have two of them, Adam and Santiago, but they're both awesome). :)
