Sometimes it does that to me when I am on msn, if teh connect cuts out for a second you are signed out and I never realise so I start to wonder why no one is talking and they realise I have been offline for about ten minutes. Which can be crucial. I didn't know Tom was leaving and this may be late to Tom but: Have a good time! I was forced into science revision earlier. I have done all the enviroment topic now. Bet I won't remember it but I tried. I can't handle the history. Its way too hard. I may go and find Mr Weston after half term to ask for any revision tips for history. I am drinking the most disgusting drink. Lilt. Yuk! I am only drinking it because its fizzy. I am meeting up with Pennie tomorrow to do our Sk8er Boi stalking and then to buy a new top for Friday. It should be a laugh.
