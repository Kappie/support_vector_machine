Heather said that I shouldn't give him another chance because of how much he hurt me (you hurt me a lot) that I should just stick with Jeremie because he seems to be more truthful also because he isn't ghetto. But that is just Heather. She doesn't like guys that dress liek Chris. But everytime that I saw Chris but didn't talk to him I would think about him for like a week. I would always ask my mom why he affects me so much. She just said that he was my first love. He still has a major part of me.    AHHH!!!! I think Vicky really likes Jeremie and wants to date him...(aside from the guy Chris she's talking about in here....) ;.; This is not cool...cuz Jeremie replied to that...and what he wrote scares the shit out of me...:   *hugs tight* Just follow your heart and do what you feel is right. If you get lost, I'll do my best to be there to help. Just wish I could help you. First love will always keep a part of you. My first love still holds a part of me although i don't think she knows it, but i merely have to live with that. *hugs tight again* Just try to be as happy as you feel you need to be and try not to let things bother you much. Love you   meh...I love him so much...and I trust him...but...god...I don't know anymore. I'm so scared that I'm going to lose him...and I don't think I could handle that at all. I mean..he's one of the few people that I trust unconditionally (There's only two other people...Tim and Pete...)...the one person that I feel I'm meant to be with. I can understand the whole first love thing...I still have some of that from Jayme (yes...I do think that I did love him...cuz I still think about him occasionally...blah). But....*sigh* I don't know. Maybe I'm just being paranoid...but...god...I don't know what to think right now. Maybe I should just ignore it...and whatever happens will happen..whether I want it to or not.
