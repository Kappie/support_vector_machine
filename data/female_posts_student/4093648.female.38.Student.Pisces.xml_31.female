    
       
        Somewhere a Seed   Somewhere a seed falls to the ground That will become a tree That will some day be felled From which thin shafts will be extracted To be made into arrows To be fitted with warheads One of which, some day when you least expect it, While a winter sun is shining On a river of ice And you feel farthest from self-pity, Will pierce your shit-filled heart.
