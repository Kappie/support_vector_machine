Since its based on an old core, its easy for Sharman Networks to close out all of its users and eliminate it from its system. Clean KaZaA 2.6 is looking to be the light of the future, but slow progress, and reluctant users, still loyal to K-Lite aren't too keen on moving on to this new "Lite"prog. So who will take KaZaA's place as the King of p2p? Limewire's network is big, to say the least, but Aqualime, it's "lite" version probably won't be around forever, and just 'cause it's a bit network, doesn't mean it's all that great, or even that fast, comparatively. Seems that progs like Shareaza and eMule are climbing the p2p ladder, taking advantage of the greatest filesharing network, Gnutella2. WinMX is also a huuuge player, and was one of the first fleeing Napster users ran to back in 2000. Its network is large, fast, and highly diverse, as users are forced to share, more or less, to get more results on their searches. Even with all these rising competitors, the RIAA can still try to find you, even if they don't know about all these p2p progs. What will ultimately decide the true king, is how much security the network can provide. If you can be safe from the RIAA, that's your winner.  On to other interests, don't you find it WONDERFUL when cashiers at places like Sears, or....other dept. stores, pretty much anywhere, express a complete disregard for the customer's hurry? In fact, they like taking their sweet-ass time when there's like 50 disgruntled customers on the line, and the one at the counter's OBVIOUSLY in a hurry, and only has a few items in front of them. I seriously believe that the people who hire cashiers turn away people who are too qualified. And by that I mean, if you can move as fast as the average human being. If you're as slow as goddamn fat cow, chewing on fodder, you're fine. If you have the IQ of a toenail clipping, even better. You don't NEED to know how to work the register! Its ok if you can't find the bar code, blatantly posted, large as life, on one whole side of the product, after searching all sides BUT that side, for a full minute. LOVE it when they hold back the rest of your items, just cause ONE hasn't been price-cheked yet!  The Simpsons: Hit  Run is a KICK-ASS game....seriously man....awesome.  I'm Deadinside...or, more recently, Death-Boy! ...away I go!  "Oh no! My insides!!...they're....outside!!"
