I...I was just...," he managed to stutter as a black gloved hand grabbed his huge neck and began to squeeze.  The speaker had stepped close to the fat sheriff.  Saltar lifted him from his wooden seat by the neck and was dangling him a good few inches in the air.  Saltar was an evil sorcerer that used magic to manipulate anything he couldn't naturally.  His appearance also suggested of his power.  He had thick, short, black hair that was slicked back away from his brow.  He was dressed in all black which brought out his pale skin.  Perhaps his most dominate feature, however, was his bright red eyes that always shined with a demonical light, making him even more sinister looking.  His voice was not too deep, his colleagues said it was more spritish.  Thomas hacked violently, trying to catch a breath even though it was impossible with the pressure that the evil wizard was putting on his neck.  "Don't ever doubt my magic," Saltar said slowly while squeezing harder and harder with every word.  He got a look of disgust on his face and dropped the sheriff on the floor in a gasping, wretching heap.  Hood's face was like a huge face beet from the lack of air he had suffered.  "Humans, so fragile," Saltar commented as he kicked the sheriff hard in the side.  Hood coughed, spattering some blood from his mouth.  "Do not forget who is in control here.  Without me, you'd be nothing more than a simple peasant," the sorcerer stated angrily.  Hood didn't respond, too scared to.  "I'll go check on our guest."
