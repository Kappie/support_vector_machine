With movies, the art is in the timing, the wardrobe and how it adds to the character or the scene, the camera movements, compaction of a long story into a couple hours, background music. It's all audiovisual. Books are a lot different, some may say deeper. With books you need an imagination, you may see the character how ever you wish, things have descriptions, but even with the most detailed descriptions, you still have variations to the imagination. for example: an aquamarine vinyl handbag with white polka dots, zipped closed at the top with a bow on the upper left side, the handles are long enough to be worn on the shoulder but not around the neck aswell. There're a lot of details there, but to each imagination, the bag is different.  my mind's not working right now, I'll finish/change this later.
