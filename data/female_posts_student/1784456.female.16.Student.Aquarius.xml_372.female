We actually kind of went a bit stupid today! Teasing Lynne... hehe... Oh, it's boiling hot today! I had to put a dress on! My Dad got hit by a coach! He's okay but he had to phone the insurers! Scary huh? The side window thingy was smashed to bits! Oh and Nailsea's scary bike gang! I was sitting down with my rabbit and then a load of scary guys on bikes came up to the front door! (Eekie!) Yeah... I'm sooo happy and err mad! Woohooo!
