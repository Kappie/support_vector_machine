My exam results were surprisingly well..good enough this time. =) Was a huge relief..  Aiming for uhm..better grades next exams tho. :P I have that interview thingy comin up in somewhere around September. *sigh*   Oh well..neways, I think it's time for some changes in certain areas of my life. Haha, which areas? That we'll know soon!  --Fluffles--
