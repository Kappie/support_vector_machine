Of course I forget that it's Tony's 5 - 8 day which means I could have slept for another 30 minutes. This of course is "my fault"... My computer desk is trashed from everyone, the livingroom is trashed and I didnt finish dishes last night. I wish I had a three bedroom so that Tony had his own room so that he could have a place to put his things such as back pack and stuff so that the livingroom would be a bit cleaner. In about an hour I can turn on some music and get some house work done. Heaven I hope I have the energy Lol.    I have had it with down the road. Marina called the police on Travis last night. A disision I support but then refused to tell the police he was the father of Alexis' baby so the police wont do anything about him and Alexis "hanging" out together even though he is a RSO. Come to find out that they were at the hosptial the whole time with Dawn and her dad. Then Marina changes her mind about the restraining order says she doesnt need it now because Kelley is refusing to buy the 2000 + worth of stuff she put on lay away for the baby and she needs Travis to pay for it. I am going to save the money Travis gives me and get the loans paid off and that way I will be "caught up" as best I can be on things and I can get him out of here in July. If I had the money now I would get him out now. I would really like to move though because it's going to get ugly.    On top of that I found out Joey has been having sex. The bad part(s). The mother wants the girl pregnant.. Joey didnt use a condom. When I confronted him about it he skated away from the topic so I waited for him to tell me which he did last night. I gave him some condoms with the understanding when he needs more he needs to come to me and tell me. I dont approve of this at all exspecially knowing the mother's agenda but I also know that if I say no he will only rebell and do it and I wont know when he needs protection. Another reason I wish I could move. Lol.    AC hasnt called, wrote or came by. I pray daily for him and feel him close to me. It is almost like he is reaching out to me asking me to hold on a little longer. I wish things had not come down so hard at this point in time. All the stress coupled with the e mail I sent him about not being able to have children anymore... I under stand I must have some faith with this and I am trying. My biggest lesson to learn in this lifetime is faith (in myself and others) and patience. I tend to not have much trouble with faith in others, sometimes foolishly placing it but still placing it. After my housework is done (yeah ok right) I will go and do some mediation and see if I can ease my mind. I can not believe I have fallen for AC like this... Even now with all my doubts I find myself smiling.  *Later* I had a weird thing happen today while at the bank. A lady asked me if my name was Alexandra (yes my middle name) she told me that I reminded her of her cousins wife who wasn't suppost to be here until the middle of the month. Her cousins name starts with an A. (same name as AC)Then I am talking to M. (she left me an e mail asking me to call her) and she got a customer today from Langley VA (or her daughter in law is from there one of the two).. Her daughter in law is coming up on the 17th of this month and something about a china set different yet the same.. What messages are we being sent ? I'm not shocked M. is getting these things we are so connected. It's June. AC has not shown. Will he be here near the middle ?? I pray he will be.  M tells me to contenue to be stong. I am trying. It's almost 8:30 at night and I'm exhusted. Kids wore me out today plus the depression and fear have taken it's toll on me as well. Marina down the road is still playing her mind games and I am sick of it but I am finding myself not caring about things anymore. I just am tired of seeing people used. Marina is all about using people. I want to move. I need to move before her 13 year old daughter gets pregnant (like she wants) by my son. I can not believe a mother would push her daughter to get pregnant just so she can get another child in the house. Plus she is talking (again) about leavin her husband and having Travis support her and the girls and the baby. I do not see how this is going to happen but who knows. I hope tht I can hold it off until the end of this month so that I can get caught up on the bills. Travis might be able to pull me out of the whole this month if I manage things right. I just have to be strong. I pray I can. If I could get 1000 extra I could pull myself out of debt and ask him to leave.. Even still I do not feel safe asking him to leave (which is why I wish I could move) but I know I will sooner or later. Matt is leaving for Yakima tomorrow for a few weeks. By the time he gets back Dave should be in his own place. I should be getting my own place back by July. Tony will be going to visit his father in July. Gods it would be nice if AC got here before then. I want to feel his arms around me and I long to hold him. I should go. I'm getting goofy.
