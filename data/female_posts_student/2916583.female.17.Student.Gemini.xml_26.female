Since I gotta clean before Ashley and Maisie come over, I'm just gonna keep it to that.  Top 10 things you'd never hear MTV say: 10. Don't you think that skirt's a little too short? 9. And #1 on the Christian chart is... 8. We play too much rap! 7.  We need to play more country 6. Those tight capris make her butt look too big 5. Shield your eyes!  Her thong's showing! 4. Praise God! 3. We need older VJs 2. It's time to put The Osbournes out to pasture and the number one thing you'd never hear MTV say... 1. Less shows, more music!  My list of top 10 hottest guys of all time 10. George Clooney 9. Ashton Kutcher 8. Josh Duhamel 7. Matt Damon 6. Leonardo Di Caprio 5. Pierce Brosnan 4. Ben Affleck 3. Orlando Bloom  2. Prince William and the hottest guy of all time... 1. BRAD PITT!!!!!!!!! Brittany E. Had a shirt on that had Orlando with an unbuttoned shirt, and on the back it said, "You know you want it."  Yummy.  Jenni's list will have to come later, cause she's immersed in the latest issue of seventeen, occasionally reading me interesting tidbits.  I'll finish this later.  Later.
