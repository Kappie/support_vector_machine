Why do I care and care and care about people and try to help them only to get aggravated when they don't try to help themselves?  Why are most of the people in my life a disappointment in the respect that they have so much potential and instead are lazy and feign helplessness?  Why can't I just let them be to fail on their own and why do I internalize it like its my problem and then wonder why I get all these anxiety  panic attacks?
