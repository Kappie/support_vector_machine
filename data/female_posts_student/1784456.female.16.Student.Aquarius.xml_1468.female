I think it's just me... wait a minute, this music is really slow.. it's Opeth they're kind of heavy but Benighted is really soothing and nice! *Heavy music's cool too, but it just makes you more depressed!* Woohoo for teenagers! Mmm... I need to write more, there are too many things flying around my head. Ahh, but I think on this, I'd bore you all to death! Wait a minute... *poke* ... *poke* AAAHHHH! Ok, erm, don't panic... Or you can... wait a minute check for your pulse! *I couldn't find it once in science, so technically I was dead* (Still am... MUHAHHAA!) Er, maybe not. It's weird, I'm listening to music from different nationalities with different languages! German, Spanish, French, Japanese, English *booo!* and some Italian I think... but their music is so much better than pop music! (Not that I like J-pop or anything...)
