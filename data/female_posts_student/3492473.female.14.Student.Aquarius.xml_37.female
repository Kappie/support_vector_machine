I've only gotten 1 or 2  bad comments  in the past and I think they were about my use of swear words and how I'm not the only one with problems. So I was a little surprised to see I got a  third  bad comment. Not truly terrible but not exactly sweet. The person just said I don't need to tell everyone my whole life and I'm not the only one with problems.  Well, ya think?  I know I'm not the only one with problems. The thing that gets me upset the most about this comment is that  no one is being forced to read this website. No one is standing next to you and making your hand click on the link to this from my profile. If you have a problem with it, then don't read it. It's that easy.   But people just need something to bitch about so they choose to bitch about this. Well fuck you then.  One day when I'm rich and famous for this kind of writing, you're gonna think back to tonight and say to yourself,  "Wow. That was the girl who told us her whole life. Now she's making millions for it."    People today.  Any who. I went to bed at around 4:30. It was crazy because my whole family (except for my sister) was up. It felt like 11 to me. I dunno, I think  I was on some sort of high last night.  I woke up around 12ish, ate, got dressed, watched some of Office Space. Eddie always told me it was freaking hilarious, I just never got around to watching it. Turns out, it is pretty good.  Damn straight.  LoL! That's funny! So then I read some, cleaned, went through magazines for articles that I wanna save, and wrote.  I'm really proud of myself for everything I've written.  Now I'm here. LoL. I'm no longer sore from soccer but I have practice tomorrow. Then conditioning starts again on Monday. OH! Carly told me  Hummel are really good soccer cleats  so I might get pink Hummel ones. I haven't decided yet. The people finally moved in the house across from me. I think they already lived in Wickliffe because I think I've seen the boy around school. Oh well. I'm on major TP watch tonight since Eddie is working late. Well, here's a poem. It's about how friends tell you what to do and how it always seems to back fire. This is one of my only poems that's suppose to be taken as a joke. Like, people seriously say those things but when I need them they're not there, so to me, it's funny.        You Say  You say, "Eat ice cream, it'll make you feel better."  You say, "Talk to me, that's why I'm here."  You say, "Write about it... it's what you're great at."  So I eat the ice cream, and gain ten pounds.  I try to talk to you about my sudden weight change, but you just snap and say I'm "beautiful."  There goes talking to you, so here I am, doing what I'm great at.  One bit of advice,
