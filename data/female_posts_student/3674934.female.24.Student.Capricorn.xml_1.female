Last week the lovely construction people - there is a house being built behind ours - started making lovely grinding noises - REALLY loud - when they have done near to nothing for about 2 months! And today somebody at the front had some sort of mower/whipper snipper/ chainsaw thing making a terrible racket - distracting me from my study. But seriously the content wasnt really holding my interest all that much either... SOmething to do with the kidneys and the secretion and reabsorption of this that and the other. I'm only interested in Sodium because I eat a hell of a lot of salt! (And am curious to find out why I havent died yet from extremely high blood pressure!) Well that part held my interest but who really cares about the rest? I know who does freakin physiologists - if i can just pass I will be quite happy.   THe last few nights I have been having a lot of trouble sleeping -Actually I always have trouble getting to sleep but more so the last few days. I lie awake for ages (Billy however falls straight to sleep - no fair!) thinking about everything I could possibly think of  - its like a crazy disjointed movie playing in my head. Now I dont think I am all that stressed about anything - impending exams aside - I dont actually think about the exams when I am trying to get to sleep. So weird I go over some of the days events but mainly things will just pop into my head that I havent thought about for ages... I think its somewhat disturbing. And I wish I could just clear my head and go to sleep...
