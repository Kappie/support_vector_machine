Unless the little green men happen to have a shrinking product... no? Oh well *sigh* Hey if I do get a .nu (not this again) I'll have to have a 'adopt a little green man' thing! Then if your page goes wrong you can blame it on the little green man! Ooh, fun! And I could have different pictures, like on of him hanging over a fire... and different stuff! Hehe, feeling evil again! I'm gonna be unleashed *whatever* on Spain at some thing like 8 o'clock their time tomorrow! Yeay! We're heading to the airport at 2 and knowing my Dad the plain probably takes off at 4 or some thing... *sigh* Any way they're an hour ahead so think of me! I will, listen to Manu Chao, I am it's setting me into the Spanish mood. I'll think of you while I'm swimming outdoors in the sun. :D (*shivers* horrible mental image) Hey the sun isn't that bad! (No, you in a swimming costume!) HEY! GRR! Remind me why I don't just chop you off. (Err... because of my devilsh good looks?) Grr... (Because I eat all the food you don't like...) Ok, deal, but I'm still mad! MUPPETS!!! AAARGH! Ahh... better... I'm goona go bisi!
