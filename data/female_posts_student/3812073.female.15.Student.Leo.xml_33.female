But   not   today.  The world just glowed today, I feel contented and lucky just to be even breathing. Despite the fact that I've caught a cold. =)  happy . delighted.   gleeful  .  cheery . gay.   ecstatic  . joyful.  euphoric .   exuberant  .  delighted .  thrilled   are the words to describe.  I felt like somehow something have changed. It all just came suddenly, the sudden realisation and appreciation of having Vanessa in my life. Somehow, it seems that our relationship had improved, and that she could understand me. Somehow, somehow. I don't know if what i'm feeling will be for a longer period of time. I do hope so.   Someone out there just filled my head the entire day . The entrance of that person somehow brightened my life. Then again, i question the existance of this feeling I harbour and its significance, i wonder if its real and lasting, if the story would have a nicer ending. My history haunts me, much as I try to forget. So much thoughts, so little time to clear it.  I'm happy, i hope it'll last. =)   Only time can tell  . So true.
