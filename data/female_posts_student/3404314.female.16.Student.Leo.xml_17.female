"absence is presence".. not because you can't see a thing doesnt mean they're not there.. like God, for an instance! another, is that, we should know what we really want, kz we'll end up not being happy.. we should not stick to things or persons that we're used to specially wen we're dissatisfied.. bkt pa magtitiis, ayt? palitan na, kung dapat palitan.. the author used mangoes for this one, hehe!! i can say that somehow... nakarelate ako!!!
