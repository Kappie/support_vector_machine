This kind of ranking system is discrimination and hypocritical in the extreme. Neal has exposed his TRUE AMERICAN IMPERIALISTIC COLOURS with this act. He must wean himself from his MILITARISTIC HEIRARCHICAL SOCIETAL INFLUENCES to truly prove himself anti-discriminatory. He is a nice chap but what is he playing at with these titles? Minister of Pornography?? Who does he think he is? Hugh Hefner? I can just see them smoking their cigars, oppressing the masses, laughing all the while. Down with the Gentlemen's club!
