Paul broke up with me, got accepted to SCMI, spent a lot of time with friends, read a book, took exams, caught up with an old friend, got back together with paul, got ready for SCMI, etc. I want to elaborate on 3 of those topics.   1) Caught up with an old friend. At one point in time he was more than a friend, but that was a long time ago. I figured that it was only natural to want to spend sometime with him considering our past. The time finally came when Paul and I split. He decided to take me to lunch and cheer me up. I was fine with that. But something seemed off. He insisted on picking me up at my house and buying my lunch...then took me to his house. Urgh, while we were there we decided to watch a movie. He kept trying to hold my hand and asking me to go swimming with him in his pool. I would have been fine with just a visit and friendly chat over a light lunch. I wasn't planning on being hit on. HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND!! And at the time I was heartbroken. Goodness people!   2) Yes, Paul and I broke up. He needed time/space to think. I regretfully had no choice but to give it to him. But that's in the past. Now we are back together. We had talked for a long time on Wednesday night. Then tonight I went over to his house. It was like we were never apart. And now, we're officially back together. I couldn't be happier. I love him with all my heart and I just hope that he knows it.  3) Thirdly and finally I want to express how much I will miss some of the seniors this year. Last night was graduation and throughout the whole ceremony I was thinking how I will miss so many of them. Some more than others. There's one senior in particular who I love joking around with. I have so many memories with him from so many different occasions. It's easy being around him and I will miss him dearly. Then there's others who I have always expected to see around. I can't imagine how hard it will be to leave next year myself if it is half as bad as seeing these folks off.  I think that is it for now. Tomorrow after I sing in choir at church Tori and I are leaving for Cookeville. Time for SCMI! A whole week in Cookeville with no mother, brother, or evil step-father to pester me. And I must say, I CAN'T WAIT!! Just kind of sucks that I have to leave the day after I get back together with Paul...go figure.
