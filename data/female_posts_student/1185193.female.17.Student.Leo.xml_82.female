But today, the firm was only  a  couple of blocks away, so I walked.  On my way I saw the strangest bakery ever.  It was called Amnesia Bakery.  I didn't link to it because I can't find it anywhere on the web.  Maybe it's one of those Twilight Zone experiences.  Maybe I imagined it.  Anyhoo, the door to it was painted like an animation picture of a door.  And in the window instead of hosting real bakery goodies, it showcased bold, gaudy  plastic pastries.  The sign on the door did say "Open," and I contemplated whether I should take a side trip to this bakery--at least peek in my head.  To my naive knowledge, I was afraid it could have been like some bizarre club or something.  There's a lot of those downtown where I work.  But I ended up passing it up.  But next time, oh next time...I am determined to see what it is.  I'll let you know.  *yawn*  The Reuter Family Van is departing at 6:45 am to go to Veronika's graduation.  I better get some shut eye  ;)
