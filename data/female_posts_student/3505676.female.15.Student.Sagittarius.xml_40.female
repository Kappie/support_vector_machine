Maggie picked up about 5 45 and we went back to her house and had fun attempting to pick out her outfit for dinner [[we were planning to go somewhere kinda fancy]] then Alyson and Jen came over, and quickly left on a search for their wallets! Then brad came over and we waited around and hung out til everyone else came. Then we [alyson, jen, lee, brad, maggie, danny, and kenzie] went in search of a restaurant- no on olive garden due to the long wait [[if only we knew how crazy it would be everywhere else]] We ended up going over to crabtree and putting down reservations at the cheesecake factory for dessert while actually eating @ this cute little italian place downstairs. Stuffed ourselves there [lee and brad and cologne...] then went shopping/hanging out in the cool store with the massaging chairs--i want one! Bought a tank top @ AE b4 everything started to close. Then we hung around and waited for our table while the guys played weird games like gas baseball and then they started this weird shooting thing! *lol* Maggie and I ran away in embarrassment! = D Ordered cheesecake, stuffed ourselves for the second time. Then headed back towards maggies.  Danny mooned lee, alyson, jen, and maggie and ended up having his hat fly off in Brad's convertible, so we turned around and got that! *haha* Hung out for a little @ maggies b4 everyone started to leave [it was about 1130 or so] Ended up being kenzie, danny, maggie, and me--good times right there! We painted dannys toenails..nah more like his FEET with polish! *lol* Then they left and maggie and i went up to bed *talked for a few hours* and then fell asleep. Woke up today pretty early and she drove me home b4 going to work. I'm so glad we're friends. So i wasn't supposed to work today..but they needed someone and sundays rock plus no one would be there today...so i went!  Kristine[love her!], Patrick [obnoxious, but not TOO bad], Robert [long story], Gillian [cool, but we dont hang out], jason [dumb], scott [cute, but dumb], and clint were working. It was pretty fun, somewhat boring @ parts cuz no one was there. When no one was there we all went to the diving well and hung out. We won't go thru the whole story, but i ended up in the water with my clothes on *thanks clint* ended up swimming in my shorts and sports bra. Dried off...then got pushed BACK in. Oh well--it was still really fun. The guys were going off the high dive with huge dolphin floaties and such-lol. Had to spend the rest of the day being wet tho. Played word games on the comp with some pple then around 6 05 Robert gave me a ride home. Ate dinner, chatted, and now i'm gonna watch a movie with the fam!
