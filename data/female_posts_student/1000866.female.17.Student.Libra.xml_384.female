He's by far the coolest kid I know and he's my best friend and he's cool and he always listens to me ramble and he's cool and I like to hang out with him because he's cool and I like to talk to him on the phone because it's fun and he's a funny kid and he's definitely cool if I hadn't mentioned that and he gives me rides to places which is a really cool thing to do and actually nothing else about my day is worth mentioning because nothing can surpass the coolness of Christopher Allen Jamrose and I want to be just like him when I grow up because he's so cool and nice and funny. The End.
