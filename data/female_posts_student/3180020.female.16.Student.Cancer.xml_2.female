She didn't get accepted into the Naval Academy. Her next choices are The Air Force Academy or LSU. The Air Force Academy is in Colorado, and LSU is in Louisiana. In case you didn't realize it, both of those are really far away. Im really sad about her leaving. Im applying to go to a summer course at Dauphin Island and its from June 6-July 2. My birthday is June 28, and Christa leaves for the Air Force Academy on the 26, and that might be the last time I get to see her for a year! :( Things at my house are very hectic. Im thinking about quiting band and getting a job. I also wanna quit so that I can take some business classes! Everything in my life is very very up in the air at the moment. The guy I've liked for 2 years finally likes me and Im not really sure that's what I want anymore. I know I dont need to say yes at this moment, and so does he. But now Im beginning to think that maybe its not what I need ever. I know I love him and I always will, but Im not so sure he's what I want! He's worried about me b/c he knows somethings wrong, and if he's worried about me now, he would for sure be worried if we were to date!  He knows somethings up and it upsets him that he doesn't know what, but I dont wanna tell him everything yet b/c I dont wanna break his heart like everyone else he's dated.  Im really really confused and Im scared he's not going to wait on me much longer, and I cant say I blame him.  :S DRAMA....that's all my life consists of. Me and Jessi got into it last night over a stupid boy, and I honestly never thought we would get into it over him. Im really sorry Jess, and I know I over reacted to something, but I dont wanna think Im being replaced by someone you hardly even know. I know that's not how it is, and I realize that now! FORGIVE ME FOR BEING STUPID AND SELF CENTERED! I love you girly!
