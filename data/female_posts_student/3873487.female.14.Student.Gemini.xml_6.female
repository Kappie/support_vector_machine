Mood: drained.relieved.dissapointed 
   ___I spent the whole morning wondering about what I was going to wear to Jeannie’s party later. I did come up with that azn top and that black skirt I got from Rehoboth on Sunday… but that didn’t seem to match quite as I thought it would. And plus, the skirt is, weird. It’s a lil shorter in the back than it is in the front!!! So it looks as if some guys wanted to get a butt show, all I had to do was bend over just a little bit!!! I finally came up with the new capris I got and that blueish palm tree top, along with my Tommy Hilfiger purse. I was so spring and blue  J  ! Then I washed my hair, and waited for Lillian to call and come over. When she finally got here, I started Holes, and started eating my breakfast =P the phone rang, and I thought it was another telemarketer, so I just used my weirder tone of voice. The dude said, “Hi, is Cathey there?” I thought the dude said Cassie, so I was like “Huh? Sorry, who did you say again?” Then I finally heard  CATHEY  and noticed it was Gene. LOL, yea I’m so slow… anywho we talked about basically nothing. He had just gotten back from summer school and was bored and tired. Then Lillian showed up in the kitchen to call her mom, I got off the phone and called Gene back when she was done. Melissa showed up not too long after, and they started to watch Holes. Then I started talking to them while I was on the phone with Gene, and it went downhill from there. First, Lillian would not let go of the fact that I didn’t have any tissue paper in my gift to Jeannie, and then there was the fact that my grandmother was there, so they had to sneak upstairs to get the tissue paper. It was funny bcuz I was like saying, “Don’t fall or break anything up there… and no looking through my stuff either” Gene started laughing bcuz he’s never heard me yell before and he found it rather hilarious on what I keep commenting on my friends. Then when they brought up the idea for Uno, Gene left me bcuz he wanted me to stick with my friends and play with them… haha, yea RIGHT, the dude called me back in like 10 minutes wondering if I was gone yet. Can’t live without me huh? Hehehe. So yea I basically stayed on the phone with Gene the whole entire time…  
   ___Jeannie’s party was great! We had fun, but I thought we weren’t bcuz of how Lillian and Melissa thought that Katie hated them, and vice versa. But it turned out to be great, and no one hated anyone! The day passed by with some light clouds, but by the time we got there, chatted, and awaited to get into Jeannie’s car to go see White Chicks, it poured!!! But when we go to the theatre, White Chicks were out, so we went and saw Spider-Man 2. Lillian and Michelle has already seen it, and so they were a lil bored sitting there and napping.  LOL , so anyhow, I thought the movie was way too  LONG , and ending where Peter’s bff was talking to his father, and we were all waiting for him to throw the knife at his reflection into the mirror… that was annoying. After about what seemed like forever, and only lasted 2 hrs or so, we headed back fro Jeannie’s and ate pizza and took pictures. I ate 4 slices bcuz I never had eaten anything at home before, and Pepsi all the way  J  !!! We sang “Happy Birthday” to her, and when she was wishing upon her candles, I spat out “Malfoy’s watching…” bcuz Jeannie was wearing the Draco Malfoy t-shirt she got, and we all laughed. Funny bcuz I never spat out anything like that before, and bcuz I don’t really have a sense of humor… oh well  J  . After that Jeannie took more pictures with us, making us do all these funny poses for the camera… haha. At around 8:45, Melissa and I started to head home,  IN THE DAMN RAIN !!! It started to drizzle and it got a lil heavier by the time I got on my door step.
