To say that their visit was nice would be a severe understatement.  It was so nice to see them and yes, we feel the gap again...lol    I think it is kind of funny because I think our daughters hit it off just as well as we did...and on a first meeting...must get it from us, huh?  Banani and Sidey (as they call each other) as best cousins...lol since according to the both of them that is what they strictly are...not friends...just cousins.  Even Bailey got really sad with the departure of Uncle Ian.   Why can't Auntie Heidi live in Chula Vista?    GOOD QUESTION!   Actually I understand completely why it is better for ehr and her fmaily to stay there.  They are much better off there financially, but it isn't going to stop her family out here from begging them to move here every chance they get...Heidi, if you are reading this...Just know you guys are loved and that is the only reason why we nag you guys to move back...it isn't because we don't have your best interest in  heart.  So spending time with them was amazing, I hope they enjoyed the time we spent together.  So anyway, that is as much as I have to talk about.  Oh Emily Love will be 1 year old on THursday.  OMG!  Where did the time go?  Her first birthday party will be on Valentine's Day...hope there is a good turn out.
