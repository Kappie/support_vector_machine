He is getting out after this. he said he cant handle it anymore. he doesnt even want to teach. He told me he understood by my letters that things are getting to me and that he will understand if I go to someone else. NO WAY.. That never crossed my mind and I am hurt that he thought that through my e mails. I am faithful to him as he is faithful to me. I will NOT go to someone else. I will wait for him. I have this dream that he will come here and we will be able to start a life together and I am not going to get rid of that dream. I shiver at the thought of his email. I hope he gets my email about me waiting for him before he leaves I do not want him to go away thinking I will find someone else. AC has a gift that he has shown me that I can not discribe and I will never stop loving him no matter what. Even if for some reason we are not compatable I will love him but I know in my heart that we are compatable. Maybe the dreams of us being together the way I dreamed were more true then the dreams of the way I thought they would be. I can not wait for him to write me back. I am so glad I got something frm him. I can not discribe. he's safe ! ! ! ! *shiver*  I just have to wait. Seeing that e mail was comfort that I had needed. Just seeing it made me feel better. I can do anything I know my love is safe and I know that he will be with me as soon as he can. I am deeply sorry I had any doubt
