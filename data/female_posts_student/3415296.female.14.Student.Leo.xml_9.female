But I really had to get my feelings out, and here is the best way. I would in a diary, but then my finger is like demented and typing is fun. I looked over to my right. It was my number one goal to finish. Stars. The stars I was planning to make all those months ago. I had just thought about all the time I put through, but I guess the stars are my motivation too. You see, before everything happened. I knew that high school would be a big step between me and..Safee. So I told myself that I needed to give something to him. I didn't want to buy him something, because any ordinary person can do that. I really wanted this to be special. So here I was, day after day making these stars. My goal to make: 1053, what I've completed: 928. I needed 125 more. I really thought I could do it, and I can. I have what it takes. 1053 1053 1053..that was the amount of days I knew him. Well, the amount of days I was supposedly supposed to know him. I wanted to give it to him at the last day of school, the 24th. That'll be exactly 1053 days. I guess I can look at the stars now, and instead of thinking about an individual, I can think about the amount of effort I put forth in it. I remember a couple months back, I was so determined that I wanted to give him the amount of days I've first met him to the day of Valentine's, but that didn't exactly work out. I guess sleeping at 6 didn't help much. I only completed half of what I was aiming for. I'm still proud of myself. I actually accomplished something that meant a lot to me.   I feel so idiotic right now. But I feel really happy for my best friend Nima and his girlfriend Joey, also known as my sister and advisor =). They have everything under control and I know I'm going to sound like a mother, but it's really great to see them like this. I remember when Nima was still down with everything that was going on with him, but now his face just lights up, I know he's happy and truly in love with his perfect Joey =). I guess they were meant to be. Same with my o4 bff bud vivo, she's got to be happy. I know she's been going through some problems herself, but she's holding it together with Mark. I remember telling vivian today that she had to make her o4 buds her bridemaids in her wedding. =).   Sudbury. 7 days. Okay I shouldn't have done that. That was scary. As you can see I can be odd at times. I was going to sit with Safee on the coach, but either way I wouldn't be able to. However, krystal's class will be split and will probably be on my coach. Graduation is 33 more days away. I'm so scared. I was aiming for an award, but I know I won't get one. My dad has faith in me though, so I won't think negatively, and Safee told me not to think that way, so I won't.   I've heard a lot of things from people. And I know it's true. I've noticed things myself, believe it or not. I just wish that, I guess it wouldn't matter. Wishing doesn't turn things into reality. I'm going to accept it and move on, just like everything else that went wrong in my life. I guess I feel much better now. Thanks to all the people that cared for me and loved me, it'll always be in my mind and in my heart forever. You guys are my life and what makes it complete.
