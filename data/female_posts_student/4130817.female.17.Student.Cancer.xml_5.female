We went to the pit tonight and coulter and matt ride the tire that is on the back of the jeeps and we go over this hill and both of them are like one handed screaming and everything it was sooo funny but then erika got stuck in the mud and matt finally got to drive erikas jeep but the point of the pit is... i dont know. Is it to get stuck in mud? or to watch people get hurt? or is it to have fun going over hills and ruining your car? If you know the answer leave a comment lol if anyone ever reads this haha but anyways gtg laters ~ashley~
