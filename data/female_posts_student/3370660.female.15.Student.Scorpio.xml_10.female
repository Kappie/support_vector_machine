I look around my natured room wondering where I am. But more importantly, who I am.  This all continues for about two and three quarter seconds before a familiar sight reminds me of it all.  You see, theres this picture on my wall that is one of the only reminders that I did anything great, not good, in my life.  But I imagine- like anything in the sun too long, it will burn and fade.  I've already burned...now its time to fade.  {I'll be in northern Kansas, then onto New York for the next few weeks. SO if I'm not updating, I'm not dead. Well, you never know..see you in a month}   Current music:  On a ship to Bangladesh | Three Mile Pilot
