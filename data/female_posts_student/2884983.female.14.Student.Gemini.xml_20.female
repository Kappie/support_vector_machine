I honestly don't know what I would do if I didn't have rain. I think I would die.  The rain is just enchanting. It makes me feel so great. I just love it too bits. I can't wait until soccer starts. I love soccer. It is just so great. I love to hip check people. :) I know it is mean..but I do it anyways. Argh. note to self: never pierce self's ears again!! argh, I hate dinner. I wish we didn't have to eat dinner. it is such a waste of my goddamn time. especially with people I don't like. garr...well I will be back.
