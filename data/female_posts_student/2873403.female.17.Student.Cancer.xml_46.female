But I'm not sorry to fake people who act like they're something they're not and lie and say something that means a lot to someone then condradict it to someone else, who it also means a lot too. Just because everyone likes you, it doesn't give you the right to fuck with other people. So fuck you. And thats it for today. I flipped a shit earlier which I really needed to get out of my system, but that probably didn't help the situation I'm in.  So anyway, forgive me. I'm pathetic. I'm a fuckbag. It happens.
