And hopefully, can push the promise to the  day after tomorrow  (no pun intended), the next day, the following day....blah blah blah... Geesh. Anyway, got guides today. March like I was going to sleep~ *yawnz*  AND MY HAIR KEPT GETTING INTO MY EYES~!! ARGH!  Hmph! Kept blowing at them but they refuse to lesten to their owner's command! Geesh, dumb hair. And now I've gone psychotic...I'm scolding my hair... Just send me to the wood bridge hospital pls! Can go on killing spree~ Woo hoO~ ^^  Anyway, tried to imitate Shinomori Aoshi today... Kept calm, cool and basically, kept quiet! Think did a good job. >. .   Ast  - The flesh of the weak is food of the strong. -   (Taken from Rurouni Kenshin)
