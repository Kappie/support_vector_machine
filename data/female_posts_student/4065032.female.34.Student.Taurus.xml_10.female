It amazes me that so much activity occurs in the grass, seemingly unharmed by all those who tread over this niche. I would like to say that I pay close attention to each hop, buzz, and fly-by, but I don't. Instead, I casually watch, scooping up each detail like a kid collecting Easter eggs. I find it interesting that my dog can prance through a flowered patch of clover that is alive with bee business and not get stung. Me? I could be sitting in a chair, minding my own "beesiness" and feel the mighty punch of a stinger.  I have also noticed that there seem to be quite a variety of grass hopping creatures. Some are black, and some are green. Most seem to have some type of goal for the day in mind, and they go about their plan as if I wasn't around. However, on occasion, I have noticed this one particular type of jumping creature. It is fairly dark in color, and I usually spot it on the pavement of the walking trail. I know it senses my presence because I can see it preparing to jump. It squats down a bit and wiggles slightly. Perhaps it is counting to three before it commits to the jumping decision. Then, as I get closer, it jumps. I don't think it knows where it is going, and I don't think it knows where it is when it lands. Sometimes it jumps forward, sometimes to the left, and sometimes to the right. Always, its bouncy landing seems to shock it.  An odd little creature, it is, leaping with such reckless abandonment.  Maybe, someday, I will work up the courage to jump haphazardly and start my journey from where I land.
