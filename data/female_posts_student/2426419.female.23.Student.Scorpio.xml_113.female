COME ON PEOPLE GIVE ME A BREAK.  geez i'm just trying to be nice.    anyway, to all who were unable to attend the film and spirituality chat, we missed you.  it was good times.  there were some very cool, vital, pertinent issues discussed, such as which character shoud be the default image in our heads when thinking of robin williams (i.e. patch adams, bicentennial man, mrs. doubtfire, etc.)  and yes, mr. keating is jesus.  oh captain, our captain  wow, i can't believe i just blogged (i really didn't have time to spare either, lucky for you i just realized that) i must go
