I cant find a song that i really wanna listen to. i put in cd after cd and try to think up of songs to download and cds to make, but i cant...nothing sounds good to me right this minute. dammit i hate that.  a week until i come home!! yays!!   i want a punk rocker boyfriend...a dude in a band with messy hair and a lip ring. hells yea. but i dont know anyone like that...people in mt airy are too..umm..idk...not unique. i guess skaters will have to do cuz those are the grungiest people in mayberry. maybe lauren will find me a good un at NCSSM. :d right L? yup.   rock on  *much love and butterflies*  CH-CH-CHECK IT OUT: www.purevolume.com/ashwin and www.purevolume.com/madison ...i want those kinda rockers...:( oh and props to this other kids blog who i saw and inspired me to look up those kids, which are his friends..lucky bitch. http://acidskater.blogspot.com  (click on his "myspace" link and check out his friend Lee..omg hottness totally all tha way-hes in ashwin) they're music kicks ass, i couldnt get into madison as well as i could ashwin, but hey, they're hot and thats a p-p-plus.
