I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe, you're taking over me. Have you forgotten all I know and all we had? You saw me mourning my love for you and touched my hand. I knew you loved me then. I look in the mirror and see your face if i look deep enough So many things inside that are just like you taking over me."  Nothing's happened the past couple days. Brad came back today. I missed him actually...we have these late night conversations about these random things and I missed that...having someone to talk to and get their opinion on things.  I've been trying to get my dad to let me go to Orlando with Monica and Jessica and Chasity or Kellie...but he's so not budging. I don't think he trusts me. But oh well. I've never been drunk and I've never done drugs/whatever and I sure don't plan on it. I just wanna head out and have a couple girl days...dude that'd be so much fun. If I can't go this year babe, you better believe next year it'll so happen. Ok now, hookin up with some guys and walkin around/riding with them/dancin at this club with them..heck yeah you better believe I'd be doin that! But that's not bad at all. I could possibly meet some guys that live there and get to know some people you know. But I dunno. I mean I wouldn't do that if I was with Matt. Speakin of Matt...I didn't talk to him for about a week/week n a half...and he msgs me 2nite. dude im so freakin happy you dont even know...he asked me if I wanted to see him 2moro nite. well i dont know lemme see what i got planned ok yea it's def. on! :D I love him yall, I really do. Only God knows how much I really love him. I guess it's how this first love thing goes though. We weren't meant to be and I'm gettin that...I do like hangin out with him sometimes though. It's good to keep in touch and talk n stuff. He's a great guy and whoever ends up with him's gonna be lucky ;) But I'm tired. ZzZZzzzzzZzzzZzZZZZ
