Seeing as there are so few youth wanting to go to Edmonton (Three out of twenty kids), there isn't gonig to be any money, really, given to us Edmonton-ers. So we have to earn it. And I had the cool idea about making hemp necklaces and bracelets and selling those. They are so popular right now, really neat, and everyone wants one...  Mom shot it down, saying no one would buy them, blah blah, waste of time, blah. Said to sell them to my friends. Told her, heh....everyone has them already... So I assumed (heh) that since she was so negative about it, to forget about it. And I did.  So for Chirstmas I asked for hemp and beads cause I was running low and I wanted some. And I received. Two balls of regualer hemp, two smaller things of black hemp (really cool) and three packages of beads. I was estathic. I immediatly start making things, and first thing mom says is what a waste of the beads, blah blah, so expensive, blah. Okay..I was a little taken aback.  Then today, I babysat Ayla, and I brought over the bead and hemp box cause I know she likes doing that stuff. We made a lot, and had fun. And that's what it's really all about, isn't it? Mom freaked out, saying that's not why she bought the hemp and beads, blah blah, what about fundraising, blah...  Excuse me? I thought they were Christmas gifts for me. Seeing as you never said anything when I opened them, or when you wrapped them...why bother? Or were you too focused on yourself to care about my presents? Sorry I got the wrong impression...  Grawl! I really dislike my mom in situations like this. And if you think I was self centered for saying that they were too focused on them selves than me, well, take it back. Every year since I can remember, we opened presents one at a time, in a circle to see what each person got. This year, mom, dad and Greg opened presents at complete random, were all talking to each other, while I sat in my corner, with my presents, waiting for my turn to come around, if it was. Some of the stuff I got Mom and Dad and Greg were never aware I got. So pardon me if I seem a bit self centered.  I really hate this. I really do. Why does everything I do, with the intent to do well turn out horridly? Everything. My efforts to fundraise, communicate with my friends via email, efforts to try and score a boyfriend, motivation to get youth group, everything. Failed.  FYI, for those who care, I'm not going to youth group after Feb 12. Fiona made me promise to stay until she leaves, and that's exactly what I intend to do.
