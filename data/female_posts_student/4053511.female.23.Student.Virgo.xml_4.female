I really wish that the Bush Administration would evolve back into a modern-era foreign policy as opposed to reverting to a Cold War-like policy. But this time instead of it being Anything But a Communist, it has become Anything But a Terrorist. The Cold War lasted for more than thirty years and I can only hope for the sanity of my friends affected by the military operations that this ABT approach to foreign policy changes and changes quickly.  It is a lot easier said than done however, because when Kerry is elected in November, he won't be able to just pull our troops out of where Bush put them. While I do not like nor agree with the fact that our troops are in Afghanistan and Iraq, the US has an obligation to fix what we truly fucked up. The public health structures in these two areas must be adequately supplied in order to support their citizenry. Otherwise, health problems could potentially become worse and in this day in age, every country needs to have an adequate public health structure to fight the AIDS epidemic.  This certainly is an interesting place to argue that feminism would be more effective than the gun-ho style of the Republican-led military but hey if it works its good enough for me. I think that it would do some good for some of the rightwingers to be forced to wear a Burka and be escorted by someone everywhere they went. And boys, you can only show the skin from your eyebrows to the bridge of your nose and from your wrists to the ends of your fingers. Otherwise, us women are going to pick up stones that are classified as not being so small so as to cause no damage, and not so large as to cause fatal injuries with one blow, but instead we'll find the ones that cause just enough damage and then fling them at you a few times.  You know I've always said that death would be to quick of a punishment for Osama if he is ever caught alive. I think that he should be forced to undergo a sex-change operation and then live under his own regime. Life as a woman would be an adequate hell for him. Oh and let's not forget to have a female circumcision after the sex change.       urlLink
