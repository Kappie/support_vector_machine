I feel so bad.  first, the whole deal with ning and jack.  then I had to go do my chinese hw, and my mother kept harping on me about my hair and how I look and my grades and how I conduct myself.  so then I got to the third day of the little workbook thing and she yelled at me some more so I just stopped working and came upstairs and burned myself a CD.  then i went to my room to contemplate, then she came upstairs and yelled at me for being so messy.  so then I just loitered around for a bit then decided to go wash my hair.  and now it's 2 in the morning and I feel so so so crappy.  The whole thing with ning is just so... stupid.  it's beyond words, really, but I still feel horrible about it.  I regret telling her anything at all about Jack now.  I regret even mentioning his name to her now.  I mean, it's just a little adolescent thing and it's normal and I  know  he doesn't even really care about it, but I feel... betrayed? by ning.  I told her and told her and told her to not tell...  of all the topics she could have chosen to talk about, why did she have to talk about that particular one?  I don't know, I suppose it's just her nature, but still.  A little bit of tact couldn't have hurt her, right?  And she told Jeff about it, too.  Maybe I should just stop telling her things.  Plus, now I have to find another dead body, unless I want to take the pictures without Jack here.  I'm also quitting violin for good today.  I have to tell my teacher.  And then I have to go to Chinese school without my homework finished and tell the teacher another bad lie about why I couldn't do it.  I'll still have to finish it when I get home, though, because my parents will make me.  Jack can't even come over today because well, one, he doesn't want to, and two, I don't really want him to, either.  So we're going to end up working twice, probably, during the week.  And lord knows how long those days are.  Then the days afterwards spent making up all the work we didn't do.  Now I don't even know how to tell people that they can't be in my movie group.  Or more like, Melanie's movie group.  I think she's choosing people.  I thought Meng was working with Deanna, so I didn't even think to bring up her name because Melanie and Deanna... don't really get along.  I think Melanie's thinking of me, her, Kailing, Chuan for sure, and maybe Kerry, Devansh, and Jackie.  I think Ning wants to work with Jackie, though, and Yini wants to work with Ning, so...  Everything's so messed up.  whatever.  All I know is that Kailing said yes and Chuan said yes and Melanie said yes.  so.  whatever.  I'm so very tired.  My mother's still mad at me, and my father's asleep, and my head hurts and back hurts and eyes hurt and I feel so bad.  The bed is looking very inviting right now.  Maybe I should try crying.  I've heard it helps.  Or write another star note.  ++sunny
