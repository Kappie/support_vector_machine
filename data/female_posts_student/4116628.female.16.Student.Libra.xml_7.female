I remember a time when I would be playing with my older brother’s Playstation (the 1st one) out of nowhere he would tell me to stop playing and because he was older than me I had to obey. I would get so mad and the immediate thought that came into my head was “I hate you”. Then there was time when my mom would buy me a new toy. Whenever I’d get good grades my mom would bring me to the toy store and I could get one thing that I wanted. (of course, he had to be affordable) I remember being so excited. I was always an AB student. Well… except for 3rd grade when handwriting was a major thing… I received a C because my handwriting was so poor. (It still is actually).  I don’t hate my brother. I love him. He may not understand me or the things I’ve gone through and how I feel about things… but he’s there for me none-the-less. I don’t think he has ever let me be dependent on him though. Living with him and his fiancé has taught me how to live on my own in a sense. I clean after myself and I keep the house clean. Now I have to find a job. I have to find one before the school year starts because I don’t think they can help me buy new clothes/ school supplies and all that. I think that I’m mature because I am willing to take responsibility and I am willing to be dependent on myself and not others.  The past 2 years have been… an experience. That’s the only word I can think of right now. If I were to write a book, based on the past 2 years I bet I could take up 800+ pages. Lots of tears had been shed; there had been a lot of frustrations too. Out of all the stress that I’ve endured though, I can’t say that I didn’t gain any wisdom from it. I have a mind frame right now that I don’t believe I would have if I hadn’t gone through what I went through. I haven’t really met anyone who has gone through the same experiences I have so I never really had the chance to talk with someone about it.  It bothers me when I hear people talk about how much they hate their parents because they won’t give them money for the movies or things like that. These are people who have stability in their family and home they don’t appreciate any of it. In my whole life, (and I’m 16 turning 17 in October) I have attended 12 different schools. This year I am going to be in 11th grade (Junior year) …and it’s going to be the 13th school I’ve attended. Are you asking why? If so, it’s NOT because my family is in the military or… in any job that requires a lot of relocating. After all the moving and changing schools and all that, you’d think I’d be used to it by now. But I’m not. *sighs* but that’s life for me. …and there’s nothing I can do but live it. 11:20 AM August 05 2004 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anyway... what happened today?  At the moment I am watching "Most Identical Twin Test" on Discovery Health. I have ALWAYS wanted to have a twin. So... yeah, I'm finding this quite interesting. I just came back from the gym. I did 1.54miles on the eliptical machine in 18 minutes. My legs are killing. I have to take a shower soon. AHH!! I think my brother just chopped some MAJOR onions because I can feel it in my eyes. Anyway.. I'm off to go take that shower. Till next time! =)
