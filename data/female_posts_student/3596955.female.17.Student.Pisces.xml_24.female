Not for I only, but for the rest of Year 12  for those not even Year 12. Some of them are still experiencing them right now  just letting you know my love  prayers will always be with you ;) This past week..oh boy. Yesterday alone. My thumb is still suffering repurcussions from the of energy of an atrocious inanimate pen! 30 pages with a crooked thumb (yes folks I cannot do the *thumbs up* or *cowabunga* for I was born w. a little thing called a *soft bone* which entitles me to such clicking most *abnormal* people cannot perform). I like to thimk myself as normal. hahaha so not cool. I'm serious! haha. Anyway, the last hour really did take effect on me. Darn computing  legal studies! geh. Having 6 exams in 4 days impelled me to go through ridiculous extremities.  Over it.  But have no fear. I am rewarded w. a much needed one  a half week off! ;) I plan to drive. Master the arts of rollerblading. And really contemplate  discern about my future. I plan to hang outties w. everyone  catch up w. everyone. Speaking of which, let me place emphasis on how much I could not do w.out friends! oh my. In Gez's words  - real friendage ! Your prolonging words of wisdom, support  encouragement was overwhelming. Oh I'm definately feelin the   luv  ! I feel rather *gatty* if such a word exists. In respect to the sudden surge of sms' from everyone of gat.04! First was from  Jodz . oawwh man she's adorable. I   luv   my second best! She called me 'GC' again hahahah. For those of you who would like to know what that means..you are more than welcome to dial 1800 help me! Or you could always ask my customers Odyssey  Coleen nicely. I ensure you that they would be more than happy to expain. hahah peace! Anywho.. gerry  always brings a smile to my face ;) Through her constant msging farrout I   luv   her! I missed her way too much. Through her simple actions, I was more than happy to spread the   luv  ! I reached  melle , our mother-type, babe-leader  ever awe-inspiring friend! And  k.merv  whom I also dearly miss ;) He was our father. In fact, I still refer to him as papa  he refers to I as anak. heheh   Joy ! Who gave me that little bit of encouragement  prayer which was greatly appreciated ;) oawwwh shucks. I miss everyone so so much :)  One more exam to go! And I will kill it. Promise. I owe that much to myself  everyone else who's been there w. me. The fams, friends, school - thankyou! ;) Oh. I got terrible news. I am not going to Phils ;( I'm headed straight for the magical island of Hawaii ;) But I really was looking foward to the Phils. I want to see my cousins! Esp. the little girls. Smart lil gorgeous ones. I want to see how theyre doing. oh well there's always next year. ;) Should I go to Hunter Valley? hrmm. Meanwhile..I gotta run. Literally run.  I had a great talk w. gerry tonight! Love you kiddos :)  -- get out! right now. --
