Since  urlLink Netflix  has become pitifully slow, I was at  urlLink Blockbuster  in the flesh yesterday and they were giving out a free can of  urlLink C2 , the half-diet Coke, with every video or dvd rental. I was so intrigued by the half-carb idea that I also purchased  urlLink Minute Maid Premium Light Orange Juice . I think, actually, they have to call it Orange Juice  Drink  because it's only 42% juice.   The verdict? C2 is half the calories (70 per 12 oz. can) but only about a quarter less delicious than regular Coke. Minute Maid Orange Mostly Juice is more watery and less pulpy than my favorite Tropicana Grovestand, but tastes like real juice.   If my aspartame headache would go away, I'd go buy more of both.
