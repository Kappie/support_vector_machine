It pays a whole lot of money, has great benefits, but unfortunately is a 45 minute drive from my house. I, being without a license or a vehicle, would have trouble getting to work on a daily basis. At first I was not going to let this bother me and take the job and bust my ass to get there. But then Thursday came�accompanied by a phone call from United Rental. They too offered me a position, for United I would be a �counter help / receptionist / customer service� person. United is located in Lancaster, much closer than the Base. I have yet to tell Edwards, but I will be taking the position at United. It pays less, but it will come with benefits and perks, as well as an opportunity to work with men in the construction business�a good thing on so many levels. They have a stipulation�they do not want to hire drug-ee�s�so I took my drug test this afternoon and should be to work sometime next week.  Things are going really well with Rob. I have talked about him before, and I was thinking that we wouldn�t be more than friends. My hesitation for more came from different motivations; he lives in Rancho Palos Verdes (two hours away from humble Palmdale), I didn�t feel I was in a position to take on a relationship at the moment (un-licensed, un-employed, and un-supporting myself), and to boot I was really�really�nervous. This was all before this last weekend. Rob, the gentleman that he is, drove up here to see me again. We talked about us, and he left with me standing by the above listed ideas. Over the week I did nothing but think about it. After more talking with the sweetie�I have come to the decision to give him a try. I can already tell that he is the type that will be willing to help and work around being so far apart. We both admit and realize that distance will be a hindrance, but I think he is definitely worth trying to make it work. I will be spending more time with him this weekend, and as far as I know he will be showing me around PV and showing me a good time in LA. I have made the decision to focus time on Rob, not to see anyone else, and see where being with him will take me. A lot of this is up to him, so depending on if he changes his mind, things may change, but my mind is set.  Two of the things I felt I have had the biggest trouble with in life now seem to be resolving themselves. It is absolutely amazing to me the way things work out at times. I need to take some time and work on my health and such to get my license back. My friend Steve has made me promise that when the time comes for me to get a vehicle, I will either buy his Jetta or he will accompany me to purchase said vehicle. Being a salesman himself as well as being car-savvy, I would appreciate the help and advice. Rob has also mentioned helping out with the project�he drives a really nice Lancer�so I may take his advice too :)  I leave with a smile�hope you have one too :)
