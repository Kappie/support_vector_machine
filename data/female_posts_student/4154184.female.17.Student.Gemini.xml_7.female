Pastu salahkan fans yang lain sebab kutuk Mas. Like..Hello?? I dun even like to talk about Mas! (buang air liur je) Until Mas nye fans ckp camtu lagi encourage orang lain cakap. And Mas, despite having unique tone of voice,  she didnt know to use it well. (sad) Her low tone is dissapointing. Its not that she's not good at all..but unfortunately, its obvious that some other students are way better than her. (but they end-up sitting "down" watching the survivors) yeah..once again, the malaysian are blind! (Remember Rosma?)           The climax of yesterday's concert : Ramli MS Announced That There Will Be 6 Students To The Final.           At that time, I was a little shocked. "Mas is going back in??? This couldnt be!!" Hoho! Memang nak dekat frust la kan. Seb baik dier cakap boleh dipilih dari semua student yang dah kluar. Muahaha! I am so wanna AFMASUK ANDING! tapi Linda lebeh layak untuk masuk final kut. (No offence Anding) For those who intend to AFMASUK MAS..think before you act. This is for the sake of our own music industry. Give the chance to Linda since she has a great and unique voice. Zarina's okay as well. Anding is too. =)  Not to forget, EDLIN!! ~~                     Final : Adam, Zahid, Kaer, Farah, Bob and ?????
