Well, for some reason all the bastards in our year seem to enjoy making his life like hell. Still following? Good. Instead of leaving him alone, because he is easily provoked, they decide to pick on him. Just because he is different they decide to class him as an outsider. Maybe they think it is uncool to like him. I think it is uncool to like them. Who gives a damn about social relations any way? If your friends tell you not to become friends with some one, then are they friends or manipulators? Every one decided to pick on him, not just pick on him but bully him. So he started crying. Dave isn't usualy a person to cry, but he was depressed that day. Where is the good samaritan when you need him? If you actually see some one hurting, don't you stop? No, when you're so intent on hurting some one for no purpose you don't, you are blinded by your peers. So they didn't. Now Dave cuts himself, and wants to die. And all because no one could be bothered to care.  Stories don't always have happy endings.
