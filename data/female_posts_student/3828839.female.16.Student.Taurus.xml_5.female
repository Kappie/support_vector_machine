"what, you wanna get a ticket?!" funny funny.   won doubles game today finally!!! adgie and i were so happy tears almost came up. calvin and alvin we played against. the older one was 12. shucks, im 16! almost got whooped by preteen kids! me and adgie were talking about how if only alvin (12) was our age! hehehe, dude, he was cute! and nice too! played singles with this cute kid, lost- badly. well i gave him redo's since "uhm, is it okay if i wasnt ready?"... "you mean redo the point?" (i aced him). "uhm nvm, well yeah?" "sure.." damn why must i be so nice! i lost that point. and many others. he was feeding off my lack of energy. iunno, wasnt really into it. by the time i was, it was too late. lost 6-2 to a 12 yr old. *sigh* o well happy happy!   thats all thats really current right now. tell you other stuff later if i have any. gotta go shower! yuck im still all sticky and yucky from tennis. hehehe. bye ya!
