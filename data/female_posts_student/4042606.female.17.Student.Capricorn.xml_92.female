Yet, people find it odd that two good friends sleep in the same bed while nothing happens. We are just friends and Mute and I are just sleeping nothing else. I am saying this to make Jackie stop screaming at me and calling me a whore. She is one to talk in the first place. So we will probably get caught when we wake up in the morning, but, we can always hope that Mute's mom has to go out somewhere so I can get out without anyone seeing.
