May I just point out though, I willl be looking after my skin but I won't be going to the full extent of having a facial (way too expensive), I won't be having a pedicure (hwo much monye is this gonna cost?!), and I won't be waxing. Guys, if you think we all complain too much about pain, I dare you to try waxing your legs, and see how much pain you get into!! Not a funny thing, waxing. Ooh, and self tan- so not a good idea if youare accident prone (comme moi!)- probably won't be doing that either, unless it washes off if it goes horribly wrong! Anyway, I cnat be bothered really, cos I'm really pale anyway, and I generally can't be assed to go to all the ttrouble. I mean, my mum ends up with orange knees and orange hands and stuff, and at the beginning of May it is blatantly obviuos it is fake! Plus, I look ill (apparently) any way, so people will just have to accept me for what I am!! Nicki, Jackie, (and perhaps even Max??!!), are yoi going to be using fake tan? I know loadsa girls in our class have been on sun beds already, but there isn't a better way to fry your skin than to go on a sun bed, so that is a definite no-no. Anyway, I am just soooooooooooo excited about it all! I mean, for most of us, this is our first real chance to dress up in really posh clothes and act all posh and have a posh meal with our friends and ride in limos and scream adn dance all night wihtout our parents being there! Wooooooooooooohhhoooooooooo!!1 I am so excited!! You boys will have to time it so that we arrive at the same time as you  (near enough!), so we can all go in together as one   phat   gang!! OMG i am so excited!! OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!! Yahhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey! Anyway, over-and-out from Jo-Jo!!!
