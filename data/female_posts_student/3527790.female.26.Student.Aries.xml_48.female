I did something that I rarely take the time to do. I spent some major time relaxing! It was great.  Saw Shrek 2 which was great. Not as funny as the first one, but the plot/story was stronger...I thought and I must say that I quite enjoyed the fact that Dragon and Donkey had kids! That was a great touch!   Saw 50 First dates which I also enjoyed. Very different from the typical Adam Sandler flick, but also very enjoyable. But I think my favorite day was Sunday.   I was supposed to go for a run and a swim plus get some work at the office done, but all I managed to do was curl up on a friends couch watch TV. Lounge around. I did make it to therapeutic riding. The little boy that I work with, he is great! He is responding more and more to me. He will now actually look me in the eye and will respond when I ask him a question. This is pretty great considering he has autism, albeit not very severe. He is learning to focus and pay attention much better. The biggest challenge this week was unteaching him the technique he has been using for posting and teaching him a new way (hand on his hips vs. Hands on the horses neck). Poor little guy it was a little confusing and it is going to take a while, but he started to get it by the end of the lesson!  anyways seeing as I have been super lazy I need to get to work and get caught up. This week is going to be a long and tiring week and I have to train pretty hard as well! Fun, Fun Fun!
