You know how when you watch movies like Emma and well i cant think of the others right now but like they meet some guy and he isnt always the likely one or the most dashing, suave or handsome but yet he has some other special zing we will call it that makes him stand apart. They are always so polite with a sense of respect toward the other and self dignity none of this hi how r u your hott.. lets go out and make out loose our virginity even though i really dont care more than two cents about you mess. i mean granted it happened anyway... they always end up on the lake surounded by trees and peaceful waters shes wearing a pretty, yet modest dress none of this lets see how much cleavage i can hang in his face business... he shows up during the day and wisks her off on a walk through a peaceful forest they chat about everyday stuff they dont dwell on emotions its not important its about getting to know the other...its all about the mystery Nowadays its all about oh hes cute lets date him or shes hot lets see how far i can get with the least amount of talking.. or still there are those normal relationships i know several and its wonderful to see they can have fun just playing pingpong or hanging out with friends they dont always have to be alone they also dont always have to be all over each other I mean what happened to modesty and self respect and you know just like opening the bible and following it I mean God gave us so much and all we have to do is try to at least live by his book it doesnt seem that big compared to all that Gods done for us.... but today thats disregarded people dont always care about those simple things like spending time with the others family or just sitting and actually watching t.v. they only just want to get the most quickly. now the people who dont wear their shirts two sizes to small to wear their boobs hang out or their jeans and skirts so tight and so low they might as well not wear them. Somebody explain to me why its so hot to where a skirt where your butt cheeks are hanging out and your skin tight shirt is sucked above a fat roll? it must be sense people where it... where are the parents these days, or maybe they were never taught... i feel sorry for the kids who were brought up to think this was ok or maybe their parents just dont care. the other day i was walking through the mall and this little girl she couldnt have been more than 4 or 5 was on the little stage outside Libby Lu she was dancing to the music not cutsie little girl twirls or leaps but shake the butt seducive mess i mean your probably thinking how can a 4 year old seduce someone well that must be what shes learning and her parents were clapping can they not see that they are bringing their daughter up to be a common slut?  Everybody claims they want to be different and orginal well ya know being modest sadly has become orginal and different even looked upon as squarish and geeky. How sad is that that we have stooped to that level. you know i dont consider myself a square or a prude but if thats what you have to be called to be decent and follow God's command then I'll deal with that and proudly call myself one. There was also a wonderful article in Seventeen in the June issue i believe about modesty the girl writing said "My guy will love me for more enduring things than my figure"  Also this only helps to reenterate what i said in my last post: "I've learned that you don't have to settle. I've made guy friends that respect me and aprreciate my personality.She also talks about what she will wear this summer;takinis and shorts to the figure tips (my kinda girl!) I agree completely with her in saying " I would rather have had one good conversation with a guy who's interested in who I really am(which is how good relationships start) than have 20 guys hitting on my because of my short skirt.My favorite quote: "Because when it comes down to it, the impression I want to leave with a guy is not "She'd make a great one-night stand..."but"She'd make a great wife." Now that is a motto to live by! This is what i strive to live after God's plan will never lead you astray!
