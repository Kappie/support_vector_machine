It was pretty cool and well we all had our share of funny moments. Even have pictures thanks to Jen.  It was great catching up and then going to sober up at a dinner and then dragging my buzzed self home to my dorm at  6:00am . ;-)  We gave out our fair share of numbers too, thanks to the new age of cell phones they now know when we lie! (Just like old time...)  Next well I was watching last adult swim and I just LOVED this  quote : -hun if i dont make it, i want you to be burried alive with me -yes dear  oblongs   OH and Rosses  Quote : "I am filled with a Sick Twisted Creativity" -  Ross   We had to sadly cancel out plans to Canada, I decided it's to cold for this chick. And then we were going to go to  urlLink SOTB (South of the Border)  but then that would take to much time and I need to be home Thursday and Friday for appointments!   SOOOO  we are now only doing a day trip. I figured this was fine since we have a cruise to go on in the summer to the  Carribean  and can go to Canada any weekend we get bored with life on campus.  I have been working on  updates  for this site including new pictures and buttons on the side w/ a new color theme but! I had to put all this aside due to the fact that I have SSSOOO much work next week due (partially due to my slacking this week) that it is making me insane. So School wise I am working my ass off (if only literally).  Having a  Party in April  sometime, if you are reading this you are probably invited, so Message me on IM if you want an invite and INFO  So I Leave now.  Maybe I will cut down on my bar intake  NEXT  week.... ross informed me I go about 1-2 times a week.  I just didn't realize it.  LOVE YOU ROSSNAMI  and feel better!            The type of ex I am is:           m i s s i n g           My ex and I took the term "breaking up" very seriously and no longer have any contact. I am ready for new lovin'.         urlLink what type of ex are you?   |  urlLink mewing.net. 'EX'cellent. HA.
