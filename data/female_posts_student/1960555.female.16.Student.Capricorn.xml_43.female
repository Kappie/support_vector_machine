Doesn't it make the toast soggy??  See, that'd be my biggest concern.  Soggy toast.  I just don't understand it.  And what's the deal with sunny side up eggs.  Could they look a little rawer?  Now that is just wrong.  They're all spilly and runny and such, and I swear they seek out other perfectly good food (bacon and hashbrowns) to contaminate with their yellow spillyness.  Dam eggs, they're so corruptive of nice food.    ..... He ate the last Nib, and she only ate the tips of her pizza, and I'm a creep?? Honestly...
