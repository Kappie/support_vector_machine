The principal, vice-principal, superintendant, student council president, and the head prefects spoke to us before we went to take a tour of the school with the assigned prefects. The barbeque there was okay. Met a lot of friends from BHES, and SSPS. Friends that used to come to RRPS was now in SSPS and we met up and talked. Same old Timothy, JinWoo, Danny [aka PC], Anthony, Eric, Amin, Edan, and Kammie. Some things never change... Haha. They're a great bunch to hang out with. I miss them. Blah. I'll see 'em in BSS next year! Haha. There were so many bugs at the barbeque. Scaryness. Hmm, saw Joel there too. Talked to him a bit. Wanted him to teach me how to say "See ya later" in Korean. Damn, he wouldn't teach me. Lazy butt. Haha! Blah.  I talked to some people during lunch and stuff. Including Tracy's mom. Dunno why she talked to me but yeah. I'll keep what she said to me in mind. Talked to some other people including Moca and Zoe and people. Very interesting... Blah. I'll know what to do and stuff. Haha. Told Nima not to play basketball at recess since he did so much yesterday and kinda hurt himself. He didn't listen. Oh well. Whatever. Do what you want. I'm definitely gonna go for guitar next year. I dunno... I wanna try vocals though. Might join the choir. I know I don't sing well but I wanna try to improve what little I know about singing. My mom would never let me get vocal lessons anyway. Oh well, whatever. Might get Brian to join our band 'cos of his keyboard/piano skills. It's a good idea. Moca doesn't think he's the "band" type but whatever. I'm gonna ask if he wants to come to our next band practise.  To be honest, I don't really think Safee is... you know. Didn't scream the way I thought he would. Like Chester. From Linkin Park, I mean. So anyway... maybe a little more hoarser? I don't know. Whatever. I'm no singing/screaming expert.   Hmm, Hillsongs concert or Blink-182 concert? I wanna go to both but I don't think I'll be allowed. Hillsongs is a Christian band and Blink-182 is just rock. Iunno. I'll think about it. Damn, the Hillsongs concert is tomorrow, I think. I wanna go!  Just spoke to my sister about Megha. What a weird little girl. She's gotta learn that you can't just go up to someone and tell them that you think their boyfriend's hot. Whatever.  Julie told me it was Dan's birthday this weekend. Cool. I'm gonna go tell him happy birthday whenever it is. Haha.   This coming Saturday we're going to Wonderland. Yup. It's gonna be cool. So many people going. Blah. I just don't like line-ups. Haha! Oh well. Whatever.   You know what? I noticed that I like the phrase "whatever" a lot. Yay. Anyway... so yeah.  Stayed after school with Nima and we just... walked around. After Octi and stuff. He and Boris were supposed to fight but they called it off. Weirdos. So yeah. Nima walked me home and yeah. I think my neighbors saw us hug. LoLzZ~! Well whatever. My mom knows about it so yeah. Even if they tell my mom it's like: "...Okay, and...?"  Blah. Oh well. I'm so bored. Blogging again. Haha! I started this blog entry around 4:30-ish and now it's 5:15 lmao! Weird. Anyway... Nima found my lost_diary account on fanfix and yeah. He said he wouldn't read it if I told him not to and yeah. I trust him. If he says he's not gonna read it then okay.   Nikki and Moca had this fight again. Jeez, people's gotta learn to chillax. Talk calmly instead of screaming. Nikki... I don't like her attitude. She's changed a lot and a lot of stuff she says and stuff bugs me. It all just started with the whole Persian pride thing. Same with Moca. She's changed a little and it's not for the better. Or maybe I'm the one whose changed? I don't know. But... I feel like I'm growing apart from Moca. Oh well. At least I still have one best friend that will never leave me. GOD.
