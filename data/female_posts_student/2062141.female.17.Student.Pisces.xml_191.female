More than once. More than 10 times I think. I almost killed us in the car. I am broke. I made you drink milk and eat vegetables (what? uh, ew?). My car is a station wagon. You're a candy necklace, I'm a chocolate kiss (OBviously doesn't work). I just hit my head on the table. Ryan, why do you hang with me again? Then again you fell off my bed so..  *     *     *  One of my very favorites, it's so rock n roll, baby.   HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN the Beatles  She's not a girl who misses much Do do do do do do- oh yea She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand Like a lizard on a window pane  The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors On his hobnail boots Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy Working overtime A soap impression of his wife which he ate And donated to the National Trust  I need a fix 'cause I'm going down Down to the bits that I left uptown I need a fix cause I'm going down Mother Superior jump the gun Mother Superior jump the gun Mother Superior jump the gun Mother Superior jump the gun  Happiness is a warm gun Happiness is a warm gun, momma When I hold you in my arms And I feel my finger on your trigger I know nobody can do me no harm Because happiness is a warm gun, momma Happiness is a warm gun -Yes it is. Happiness is a warm, yes it is... Gun! Well don't ya know that happiness is a warm gun, momma?
