But when I really dreamt of him, I would realise the outcome would be opposite. Why liking someone is so painful and difficult?? Am I wrong to love him and hold onto him?  Why my friends begged me to forget him and let go? For 1 year, I always think of him, thinking of all the possibilities that caused him to change. How would someone change drastically overnight?! It's impossible... I am unable to accept it... What had I done wrong that caused him to leave me without explanation?!  Why are you so heartless to me.... Why are you treating me this way... Why.... Why forgetting you is so difficult?! WHY!! IF ONLY I never liked you, I would be much happier now! Why do I still care so much for you know.. Why do I have to like you, when you don't even care... Why am I doing all these for you when I know you would never be back to me again????
