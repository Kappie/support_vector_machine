It doesn't matter though, pipeting is my kind of fun. It's rather boring when you have to do that over and over and over again in the replication process of the DNA by feeding E. coli bacteria (which I did for my seventh grade science experiment), but I actually get to do something interesting.  My list of what I have done so far:   DNA restriction enzyme digestion helped in the ligation and transformation process DNA purfication   So, what did I find out in my long series of pipeting and shaking? Well, the DNA I did the digestion on was screwy... it was the wrong DNA. Ha! Take that, you person. So my mother was running the experiment on the wrong DNA... good for her for suspecting it, bad for whoever gave her that DNA. Then we did DNA purification and our results got worse as time went on, so my partner in crime and I were allowed to go home.  Other discoveries:  I hate driving, particularly during traffic hour I hate milk and growing old because I am not a bit more partially lactose intolerant I LOOOOVE pippettes =P and any squishy apparatus in the lab I hate the smell of the medium and bacteria... worse than sour milk I am stuck in Catch-22 and I can do nothing about that My handwriting is pretty   Now I will see if I could get the picture of my gel on here to show the world...
