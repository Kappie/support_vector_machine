I went to the mall yesterday and I got my hair cut, and then Bill and I got earrings and went to my grandmas. Grandmas house was fun:) hehe..I had a good time. Tomorrow is my sisters graduation party..hooray. not..:-\. Fuck face is probably going and I dont want to fucking see him. AHH...I'm dreading it and my mom says that my door is going to be locked to my bedroom and that I have to stay outside. Grr..family, I hate them. I have it all planned that I'm going to ask my parents that if I keep up my grades if I can get my lip or tongue pierced..and if they dont I'm just going to tell them that I'll get it done behind their backs, because they said that they'll kick me out..but if they do I'll just go live with bill or something and they wont like that so they'll keep me. Good plan:) welp, Im leaving now. bye bye
