We just came back from Cobourg, Ontario right on Lake Ontario.  We have been going there for 3 years now and will continu going for as long as it thill stands.  The weather was ok but not great.  We still had fun on the beach, in the lake, shopping, shopping and also a bit of shopping.  hi hi hi.    It was just the 4 of us this time and it was well deserved.  Our Family Unit needed it...  So now I am unpacking and cleaning just to repack on the 8th for our second trip but this time to St-Andrew's by the sea in New Brunswick to see Mom in Law.  The girls are trilled about going there.  And it will be at the same that "Lizzy MacGuire Movie" release.  Guess we will be watching it in the car....  9 hours, need to keep our minds filled with something and shopping requires us to stop....  Not a thing that hubby wants to do, much to my chagrin.  Anyways, will potts around this afternoon and back to soccer tonight.  Looking forward on getting back on track.  Have a good on and.................Be Good
