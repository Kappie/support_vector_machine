     
      The day grows closer, September 7th, the first day of football season!  I am still without a team to call my own, though I am leaning heavily toward the Colts.  I have found something new and exciting to fulfill my ever-growing appetite for FOOTBALL, Fantasy Football.  Okay, so perhaps Fantasy Football is not new, but it’s new to me.    Though I have to admit when I was asked to join a league I was first excited, then a bit leery, then excited, then leery.  In the end, I ended up joining; who can say what will happen from here.  All I can say is that Brett Farve had better have one more good year in him, the Raven’s defense had better not disappoint me, and Amos Zaroque had better pay off in his bold move to start in front of Jarome Bettis!  So root me on, I may need the help!  ~Kristyn
