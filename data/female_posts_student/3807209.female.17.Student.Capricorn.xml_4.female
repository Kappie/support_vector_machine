I got to sleep in this morning, did my chores on my own without people crowding around me and fighting (ie. Kait and Alex!!!), went to the store, picked up my last steady paycheck from my  stupid  old job, hung out with Mario and got coffee (oh my gosh we talked for such a long time!!!!- it was like 3 hours or so!!!) had an awesome time with him!! and then I went out with my mom and got dinner then ice cream (from my favorite place: MARBLE SLAB!!! SWEET CREAM IS THE BESTEST!!) Oh and Mario got me this  reallly  cool photo book of whales (my favorite animals!)... they're so beautiful!! So Mario, if you're reading this, you rock in my book! Totally cool (again- theoretically speaking since I really dont have a book!! tee hee). Les- we so gotta do something huge for your birthday!!! It's upon us.. ten days and the clock is ticking- like I said, what do you want for it? (besides True Vine- Mario already promised you that one!)      God you are soooooo amazing! I cannot even begin to tell You how much You mean to me! Thank you for bringing me into relationship with You and thank you for drawing me closer to You this past weekend and week- You mean more to me than any other earthly thing! Show me the way that I should go! I really just want to know You and to seek Your face with all of my heart and strength! Show me Your ways and hide Your Words in my heart that I may not sin against You! Reveal any offensive way in me... I am so open to whatever You have in store!! Your Ways are so awesome, so amazing.... I cannot even comprehend why You bother with me! Help me not to disappoint You Jesus!        Anyways............... sooooo sleepy! I should probably turn in- feeling like an old lady!! It's only like 11:00 for goodness sakes!Where is alll my spunk... I think it melted away in the HEAT!!!!!! Now I remember why I cant bear Texas summers..... must find somewhere cooler! Or else I'm gonna end up like the wicked witch of the west- nothing more than a puddle! Tee hee hee- okay, peace.. I am so outta here!  "Veni, vidi, vici." I came, I saw, I conquered. -Julius Ceaser
