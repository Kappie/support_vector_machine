Professor Dietz was in Peru in 1980, just folllowing the election between Reagan and Carter.  On Wednesday morning after the election, he was having coffee with a fellow academian, who happened to be a very well educated Peruvian.  The headline of the front page of the local paper, of course, read "Reagan defeats Carter in United States election", or something similar.  Dietz's Peruvian friend, very intelligent but accustomed to a completely different political environment, looked at his American friend straight in the face and their conversation went as follows: Peruvian: So, Reagan has won the election, correct? Dietz: Yes, that's correct. Peruvian: Well...does this mean that he will now assume power? Dietz: (looking puzzled) Yes...Reagan will be the next President of the United States. Peruvian: But how do you know for sure?  How do you respond to a question like that?  We Americans take for granted the idea that following each election (the 2000 Presidential election notwithstanding), the person who wins takes office and retains power for the next 4 years.  Another election is then held, and the democratic process repeats itself.    Things are not so simple in Latin America.  As we have seen in the case of Venezuela, democracy is a very fragile system in the majority of the rest of the world.  After almost 50 years of stable, 2-party elections, the Venezuelan political system just collapsed.  Just like that.    Have you ever considered the possibility that representative democracy, as we know it, will cease to exist after a time, or that there is any other option for government?  The way our government operates is the exception to the rule, not the norm.  Until we realize this, we will always be in constant battle with other nations that fail to see, for better or worse, the way we operate.  Until we put ourselves in other people's shoes and in their environments, we cannot fully comprehend their lives that are so very different from our own.  If my trips to Cuba and Brazil taught me anything, they have taught me that much.
