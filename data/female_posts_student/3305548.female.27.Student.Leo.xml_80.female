In order to get the numbers in my checkbook registry to come to some logical conclusion I usually have to search my husbands pockets of everything he's worn for a week, turn our little basement area upside-down, log on to my checking account website two or three times, and inevitably redo half the math from the past week and half's purchases, twice. Ug. I work so hard to keep track of all of our purchases and the little columns of numbers. I never approach the checkbook without a calculator! Why cant an ordinary everyday task like that be simple? Because then it wouldn't be my life I suppose.  We picked peaches yesterday. Out of my mother's orchard I think I had my first time ever in my life experience of picking real edible fruit from the tree it grew on, wiping it off a bit, and taking a bite. I got some nice snapshots too. I will post those when I get a chance.  My life...well it seems to be a little off kilter at the moment. I am going back to the YMCA just to work out starting next week. I feel a little wimpy for admitting I am a little nervous about even stepping foot on the YMCA grounds. After I got fired, fought for my job, then had a relapse of my virus and lost my hard won job due to having to call off again...I feel I guess a little ashamed. I am still a member and I have the right to use the facility. And some evening sometime in the next few months I am going to have to go to the office I used to work in and raid the CPU I used to use for copies of my work so that I can have it for my portfolio...and that will take a fair amount of time really. So I am going to have to suck it up. I cant let a little trepidation of seeing my old boss keep me from my health. I am a little disappointed in myself for feeling so cowardly. I did nothing wrong. I didnt deserve to be treated the way I was treated. I was a good counselor. I did my job well with no complaints....My confidence was admittedly shaken with the events surrounding my firing...But I still did nothing wrong....I hope that sinks in soon.  Observations on the human condition: Well, the cable guy came out today to check out the cable connection at this house for the third time since we have even lived here at all...and the like 10th time total in the last 2 years. He says there is electricity running over the cable line which has likely been causing the problems that we have been experiencing with the internet zapping in and out and moving slower than molasses. While I talked to him when he was here, and displayed a certain knowledgeableness about the subject and cable and electrical wiring...the cable guy still insisted on calling my husband to talk to him when all was said and done. *sigh* Sexism lives on.  My Dad sent me the following in my email....  ITS TIME TO REEVALUATE OUR INVOLVEMENT  Every day there are news reports about more deaths.    Every night on TVthere are photos of death and destruction. Why are we still there?   We occupied this land, which we had to take by force, but it causes usnothing but trouble.    Why are we still there? Many of our children go there and never come back. Why are we still there?   Their government is unstable, and they have sporadic leadership. Why are we still there?   Many of their people are uncivilized. Why are we still there?    The place is subject to natural disasters, from which we are supposed tobail them out. Why are we still there?   There are more than 1,000 religious sects, which we do not understand. Why are we still there?   Their folkways, foods, and fads are unfathomable to ordinary Americans. Why are we still there?   We can't even secure the borders. Why are we still there?    They are billions of dollars in debt, and it will cost billions more to rebuild, which we can't afford. Why are we still there?    It is becoming clear...          WE MUST PULL OUT OF CALIFORNIA   I just about died laughing when I read the above email from my Dad. HA!   In the "real" news:  The house approved a bill that would not allow federal courts to force states to recognize gay marriages that are approved in other states but not the state in question. This, if it would pass, would essentially cut the Supreme Court out of the loop of checks and balances and prohibit people from using the court system as it is designed to be used with the ability to appeal to higher courts. The bill is not expected to live through time in the Senate...but I think its a mite bit rediculous the House is so desperate to prevent gay marriage that they are actually slashing at some of the basic lifelines of the Constitution and Democratic process.  Shocking News! Joan and Melissa Rivers will not be at the Emmy Award's Red Carpet! It's a break of tradition! It's the end of the world! This is considered news???? Apparently the Rivers' ladies are leaving E! TV for more money at the TV Guide channel but E! hold the official Red Carpet rights. Besides, I didn't think the name Rivers meant all that much these days. Shes hardly truelyscathing, and hardly fashionable herself. Ah, well.  Rented Movie Reviews:  Stuck On You: Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear Okay first question - why does Greg Kinnear get comedy roles? Anyways - this movie was fun and we enjoyed it for the most part. It certainly made us laugh at times even if it was far fetched and rediculous at times. The Farrelly Brothers must be scraping the bottom of the barrel. After watching the blooper/outtake real we saw that Fox must have given the film a hard time about wasting film. Damon and Kinnear took this to heart - and it is obvious from the outtakes that they thought the movie in and of itself might be a waste of film. Damon at one point even says something like, "I have no respect for the scriptwriters of this movie." Woah. Harsh. But knowing the actors knew how rediculous they were being made the movie even better in retrospect. The Premise: Conjoined twins share a liver and grow up cooperatively and share all experiences...even when they may or may not share the talent or interest in it. The Good: Erm...the impressions....Matt Damon in general gave this movie his college try...and his acting gave it a bit more presence than it would have otherwise netted. The makeup and costuming of the conjoining - this was interesting and I am sure posed some challenges. There were definitely funny moments and comedic value to this movie...I guess the question is was it worth a whole movie of it? The Bad: Some of the cameos...Cher in general. It's sad when one of my favorite moments of the movie is the song and dance number from the musical version of Bonnie and Clyde. The Ugly: Did I mention Cher? Overall: Rent this if you need a good laugh...and have seen all of the other better funny movies too many times.  Perfect Score: Scarlett Johansson, an NBA star, the kid who played Vladamir in "Camp", Mathew Lillard and other sundry youthful cast members. The Premise: A gaggle of high schoolers with different backgrounds, talents, and reasons all need to retake (or take) the SAT and ace it. They decided that since the system is slanted against them by attempting to flatten the playing field and ignoring the individuality of the students they will break into the building that houses the offices and steal the answers to the next SAT exam. The Good: Johansson cant go wrong even when dealing with skimming the top movies like this one. I mean, even though the movie comes around to a sort of relevation of the inner worth of the individual and whatnot at the end its still no "Lost in Translation." Other goods, it referenced Breakfast Club...which I thought was kind of ballsy and funny. The movie is aware of its genre and pidgeonholes, and on that note - it tries to break the stereotypes of everyone involved a little. That is somewhat refreshing. I liked the narrator of the movie, and I found his character to be one of the best written ones. I also liked the running gag about figuring out what SAT stands for. Saturday AM Torture  All in all - my husband and I both still enjoyed this movie (and neither of us got too terribly bored during it) but "Cheaters" which has a similar theme might be a little better, and more realistic in dealing with consequences. Rent This with Cheaters for a double feature.   Soon-to-Come Reviews: Win a Date With Tad Hamilton (Rented), Catwoman, and The Bourne Supremacy.  That's all the news in fits of print...for now.  --Mack
