It makes me sad, and nothing makes me sadder than when Christians complain about other Christians in order to get onside with a non-Christian mate. I've done it so many times. It's kind of a pride thing -- trying to get across that yes, some Christians are strange/bad/boring/annoying but  I'm  not like that. But what does that do in the long run? Really, I am strange/bad/boring/annoying -- and sometimes the very thing that turns a non-Christian away from God is someone like me.  It started with the Crusades. Yes, we have to recognise that something went wrong. And any historian with half a brain can see that the Crusades were far more political than religious in the international scheme of things. So we say, yeah, the Crusades were bad, but  we're  not like that. It was the Catholic church. Or it was the Knights Templar. Or it was the rich people posing as Christians. Or it was because the Church and the State were combined so people became 'holy' people for the sake of power not Christ. Anyway -- the conclusion is, it wasn't us, it wasn't the real Christians.  So then we bring that into the modern times. When our mates say that religion turns them off because it starts wars, we say that those people aren't real Christians. When our mates complain about tele-evangelists where you can send them $20 to get your hanky blessed and receive healing, who are just in it for the money, we say that those people aren't real Christians. When our mates laugh at thewomen in long denim skirts and headscarfs who stand outside McDonalds while their husbands preach to the boy-racers, we say that those people aren't real Christians in the modern sense. When our mates see documentaries on TV for 'destiny' type churches we say, a little more hesitantly, that those people may not be real Christians. When our mates see American bible-belt Christians evangelising on campus with loud mid-west accents, we say that they aren't like NZ Christians, they may not evenbe real Christians. When another church in town has a healing meeting and people speak in tongues and are 'slain in the spirit' we say that the Christians in our church are more real in their relationship with God than those people -- there is a danger they may not be real Christians.  So when it comes down to it, we end up trying to bring people into our church, rather than  the  Church. But then comes the day when our church starts doing things we aren't used to or don't like, and we end up thinking we are the only real Christian. We try to 'make converts' to ourselves by convincing people how cool, how spiritual, how sensible we are in comparison to those other "christians".   We feel more comfortable when we are surrounded by people with the same beliefs as us. This is the way the world works. We try to work out little places where we can belong, where our comfort zones are kept neat and tidy, and we don't have to be challenged by difference. But Jesus didn't come to make everyone the same. That was what Mao came for. Jesus is full of  grace  and  truth . In grace there is acceptance of difference, and in truth, difference is displayed warts and all.
