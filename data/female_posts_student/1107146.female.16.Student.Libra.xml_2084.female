So the whole name would be more like "Moose Carcass (disclaimer: no animals were hurt in the writing or performing of this music)" and that's just a really long name.  Good luck with the new tea.  Sorry for interrupting the monologue.  I know you were having a lot of fun being the center of attention and all.
