I'm sorry to be blunt, but what the **** is going on with the world?! If I was a lazy little sod, then I'd like to know in advance whether it was a physically or mentally demanding job, which took lots of time, precision and effort then I'd avoid it and do something else, like be a politicion, for instance.  Here are a few examples of things that have changed due to the explosion of PC:  Dinnerladies are now known as MIDDAY SUPERVISORS Half-caste is now known as OF MIXED RACIAL ORIGIN  and my personal favourite:  Bin men are now URBAN WASTE DISPOSAL OPERATIVES.  "oh darling I'm just going to put the bin out... the urban waste disposal operatives are here."   I think not.  I'm glad terms like "nigger" have gone out of use. For one thing, that's just not a very nice word even when taken out of context. But it's used nowadays by 'black' people in rnb and hiphop style songs when they refer to each other as "niggas". of course this is different, though, as it has the uber-cool 'a' instead of the ever familiar 'er'.  Have you ever seen the tv programme Love Thy Neighbour? Well it features a white man and a black man, and the relationship between them. They hate each other. Here's a short typed extract.  White man (I don't know his name) *makes phone call*: Hello? Is that the racial complaints board? ...Yes I'm white. All over. And proud of it... Yes I have a problem with a black man. ........................What's he done? He's moved in next door, that's what he's done!"  I'm not in the slightest bit racist, but at the time it was chuckleworthy, lighthearted comedy. But of course, it was removed from television due to being offensive to black people. Change of scenery, come up-to-date a little, and watch the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. They constantly make comments about black people, and to white people, make the same sort of comments that would be considered racist if it was the other way around. But I can sit and laugh at it, because it's not real. People forget that in these tv shows are fictional characters, and nobody is being harmed in any way.  I don't see as there's anything wrong with it as long as people are aware of the boundary.   If we can't laugh at our differences, then we have absolutely no hope of ever surviving all together as one. The fact that we're all different is one of the most amazing things about the human race, and we should be able to acknowledge and humour that. If we're going to continue the way we are now, banning words and phrases like "dinnerladies" then we are driving the human race into an oblivion of politically correct ruins and we'd be better off shooting ourselves now while we still can.  Bloody politics.
