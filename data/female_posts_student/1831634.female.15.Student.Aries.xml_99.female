You see, it bothers me to no end that there is a chance that the news I'm reading every week [the only news I read every week] might not be the best in the market.  So I've been debating about signing up for Time magazine for a while now [oh, and also because they have better covers... generally speaking].  But then yesterday, I read the Newsweek article on the Johns.  And I found out that Newsweek is a Democratic publication.  Now, I can safely say that I adore Newsweek.  Especially the Perspectives page.  Although I do admit that I like looking at the Newsmakers, too.  Especially that little red bar right under the word "Newsmakers", because they always have some interesting tidbit under there.  This week's was" $3.6 million   The amount Johnny Depp paid for his own island in the Bahamas.  Now, that is some stuff I could probably live without knowing, but knowing it makes my life a bit sparklier.  I like sparkly lives.  Plus, I like looking at the Tip Sheet.  There's some pretty interesting stuff on there.  However, the Newsweek articles always seem to be more... immature than the ones in Time.  The voice always seems to be more casual and not so news reporty like.  Which can be a good or bad thing.  Haven't decided which yet.  My favorite political cartoon of all time came from Newsweek this week.  It's positively hilarious.  I laughed out loud when I first read it.  There is a couple watching the TV.  On TV are Kerry and Edwards hugging each other.  Rather enthusiastically.  And grinning like idiots.  And the woman says to the man, "Maybe we should ban same sex running mates."  Now, that's just genius.  Okay, that's it for the magazine stuff.  I don't think I'll post the rest of what happened at Lisa's house... basically cuz all we did was sit down, watch spirited away (oh, yeah, we also got a decent picture taken...), eat, watch spirited away extras, and play more pingpong.  Volunteering tomorrow!  And Friday!  And Saturday!  And next Friday!  And next next Friday!  And next next Saturday!  And Eileen wants to volunteer with me!  And she's going to find us volunteer opportunities!  And she wants me to go over!  Yay!  I
