Next on my blog to-do list: blogs I frequently read, so stay tuned.   I feel completely exhausted. But it is a good exhausted.  I believe there are two types of exhaustion:  Type 1) Sitting around doing nothing all day, locked indoors. This situation               causes intense mental cacaphony, feelings of insanity (especially if you've decided to hype yourself up on caffeine), and feelings similar to that of a worn out record. In my case the tension mounts where I feel tiny little particles swimming around in my bones begging for physical exertion.   Type 2) Oh the glory one might find in Type 2. Type 2 exhaustion is usually a sign of accomplishment or living productively. This is often characterized by the completion of both mental and physical tasks and is well deserving of a nice hot bath at the end of the day.   Today I found myself falling victim to Type 2 exhaustion... to make a long boring drawnout pointless story short: :wokeupearly: spanishexam: horsebackridingfor3hoursinthehothotsun: flattire:waitingroom: groceryshopping: yumyumwatermelon: 6:00news:madedinner: foundeverysinglehotellistedintheabacosonexpedia.com :andyesitookmywelldeservedhotbath:  Oh yeah that painting is way abstract. Kandinsky.    I was listening to the radio and they had a dream interpreter as a guest. A man called in and explained that he had a reoccuring dream of trolls chasing him in an underground maze. The woman's interpretation explained that he had problems facing up to his ugliness OR he just played way too many videogames when he was younger. How about a bit of both?
