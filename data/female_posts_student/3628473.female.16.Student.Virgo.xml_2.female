I didn't want to worship fully... Why? Cause I’m scared of my God... Yes, I should be, I mean look at all he has done, look at what he does, think about what he is going to do... Am I so scared of actually experiencing Him. to the fullest... I know I can't handle it all. I did have a taste of it, and to tell you the truth I don’t know if I want it again... I'm scared of just diving right in and experiencing my God the way he wants me to. I feel comfortable with how I am right now... Close, but not to close... I'm comfortable... What a horrible thing to say... I'm satisfied... WHY? Maybe cause that’s what I want.. I want to be done. I want to stop having to grow maybe. But yet the right Christian response would have to be, I do want to grow... more and more, I want to experience God to the fullest. Well... I can't say that. I mean I can say anything, but my heart doesn't want it. Why? Why doesn't Cassy want to experience God even more then what she does now? Cause she’s scared... And she’s comfortable with it right now... What happens if I do see God? (I don’t mean like in a person, but whatever God does, he does) I would have nothing to say... Thank you doesn't add up, I’m sorry doesn't mean anything. So I just stand there. Some would say in awe... Which yes, what can I say? I would say looking stupid in front of a cute boy you really like... Or I run? That just came to mind. I run from God... I start thinking about something else, I start talking to someone else... I do something else. I did it with this... I am putting a post on here. Trying to avoid experiencing something bigger and better then I am. And I’m scared to stop typing and start praying. Cause now I know that my God wants me closer. So if I don’t get closer, I don’t get closer. And that is killer... Is anyone really scared about experiencing God fully... I know its a stupid question, but I know I always say how fun, and awesome and wow it will be. But really. But is it real? Is it truly God that is showing himself to me… I don’t think so. Why would he? I have heard and read tons of stories about men that feared the Lord and he was friends with them (FRIENDS!!!) So yea duh he showed himself to them… but me? Am I a friend of God? Or just one of the worshipping people… Walking around mindless saying Jesus loves you… He is choosing to have a friendship with me… Am I choosing the same? I am a horrible friend, so I don’t think I could have a friendship… Its sooooo hard!  By the way... I am listening to "the wonderful cross" and all i can think about is... WHATS SO FREAKIN WONDERFUL ABOUT IT? My God was killed on that darn thing... Why should i say thats great, thats wonderful... I wasn't forgiven cause of the cross... I was forgive cause my God died... Well really his son, but HE DIED... The cross didn't do anything! I see it as if Jesus was shoot with a gun, we would all have a gun on our alters... Right? Now dont get me wrong, i dont think there is anything wrong with wearing a cross... Or having a cross. But you need to know what it means, i mean come on! I see tons of people wearing the dran thing and act like My God, the person that went on those pieces of wood for that person, hasn't changed there life... How sad! I think its beautiful to see someone wear it, it makes me happy to think "wow they are saying something" But is someones life really refecting that? I would like to hope so. Sorry getting off my thing... But i dont see why i should say that those piece of wood that hurt him soooo badly is sooo wonderful...The same with Wipes, and Nails... I should get a little tome thingy, you know to show that he didn't just die, but he came right back up! Where can i get one?
