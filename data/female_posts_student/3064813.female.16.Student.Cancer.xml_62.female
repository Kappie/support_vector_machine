I haven't posted in a while because my computer is BROKEN (the little BASTARD) and my dad is petrified that I shall visit the same wrath upon his computer that was visited upon my own.  Only PROBLEM is that daddy is SCARY and the ONLY reason MY computer is shit is because that goddamn iMesh downloaded a spyware thing onto our fucking computer.  Little bastard.  If that netnanny (forever to be known as The Bitch)thing hadn't fucking BLOCKED all the p2p networking we'd still have Kazaa and everything would be HAPPY and, most importantly, not broken. Yarr. What else has been happening in the lovely world of me?  Ummm.  My dog died, which....  Okay.  Ready for a visit into this heartless world of mine?  Here we go: I'm not even remotely sad about her dying.  I mean... I'm going to miss her.  She was a sweetheart and I loved her to death but....  It should be sad, but it's not.  And I'm sad because I'm not sad and it's really stupid and JESUS I think someone just puked in the back of the classroom. ...okay no, it was just someone shuffling cards.  Or something.  Yeah, about that paranoia.... One more day until school's out.  One more day of blessed freedom.  And Josh is going to take me to see that apocalypse movie.  Damn I spelled that really, really incorrectly.  Apocalypse. Crap.  Spell check time.  Word it!  Word it good!  Ahaha!  I got it right!  I love it when that happens. So, I've got writer's block.  I have two stories that I REALLY need to finish, because they have the most reviews and are closer to being finished.... But I keep wanting this ONE (Sympathy for the Devil) to be my CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT to date and I really want it to go perfectly....  And I think there's something missing still.  I want to really show the psychological wear and tear that this girl is going through... Because she eventually will go crazy and kill people and I need her to have a damn good motive.  I need her will to fail and I need her to be so completely exhausted that she'd do  anything  for emotional stability.  Grrrr.  Arrrrg.  *broods* So... yeah. And......... I want to draw more, but I can't because I've got artist's block too.  And I'm going CRAZY paranoid and FUCK there's still another hour and five minutes of this class and I DON'T WANT TO HANDLE THIS.  GOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDD. So, maybe I'll just ramble for a little bit longer.  Don't expect me to be talking to you fools the entire period-- that'd make me CRAZY and I'm not that psycho yet. So. What should I have a one-sided conversation with this little blog about????  OH, I KNOW.  I'll practice talking about myself because I really suck at that.  That means that I need to go find a personality forward or something and post it in here because I can only do Q/A sessions.  You ask me to tell me what I think is important about my life and I will say "Green Day" and that's about it.  Which, you know.  Isn't all that I am, hopefully because... that'd be sad.  Even though if Green Day could mutate into the Christian God I could be a priest and live happily ever after because my life is devoted to those stupid band people anyways. Oh.  Something fun: I politely borrowed (stole) Jason's Reel Big Fish pin.  Yay! Right.  So, apparently I'm too lazy to actually go surf the internet for one of those things, and I'm too lazy-- Fish.  I had a dream about bushes and water and a house and it was KIND OF LIKE JUMANJI but... cooler.  And, tropical.  And mom... hmmm. I am thinking of a yeti and I haven't the faintest idea why.
