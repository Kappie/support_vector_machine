Sorry Jason, we didn't go to Calver's.  We all had wonderful laughs over lunch tho.  After lunch, Lizzie and I went to pick up her contacts and then we went to Best Buy.  That is a wonderful store, I could sit there for hours just looking at the stuff.  Then we went to the mall.  That wasn't much to talk about, it was there still for those that were wondering.  After the mall she dropped me off at school so I could get my car and then I came home.   Once I got home around 5ish, I did my Algebra which is super easy.  I find it ironic that we are learning about Matrices the same time the movie came out.  But after that, Lizzie and I decided we wanted to go to a movie, School Of Rock!   That was an awesome movie.  It was really inspiring to just want to be a rock star.  Watch the movie, you'll get it.  So yea...That was my Friday.  Tomorrow night I have to babysit, which is never any fun, but atleast I'll have money then b/c I'm currently running on $2.   I have to share something with you all that I thought was really funny.  In my horoscope in the latest Seventeen, the last sentence says "After all you could be in love soon"  I laugh at this.  This is me laughing. "Hahahahaha"  Sorta off subject, but Lizzie was showing me her formal dress and it was so pretty I want to go! (Has spoiled girl pout on my face)  I'm happy this weekend I don't have to dedicate my weekend to homework, I can actually live a bit.    But now I'm done typing.  Night!
