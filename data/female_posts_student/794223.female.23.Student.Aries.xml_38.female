A cinemagraphic feast for the eyes.  You thought the Battle of Helms Deep was intense?  A trivial quarrel compared to Minas Tirith and Pelanor Fields.  I mean, I thought that The Two Towers was even better than the first movie of the Trilogy, but this...blew the other two out of the water.  The entire audience should have cooperatively invested in boxes of tissues, this movie was so emotionally intense.  Around the middle of the film half a dozen people that were sitting in front of me were leaning forward in their seats (myself included), biting fingernails with mouths dropping about every 3 minutes.  Even the guys were sniffling.  I'd be shocked to Mordor and back if this doesn't get an Oscar, or at least nominated.  I'll be putting up a film review on my new website pretty soon.  (http://www.geocities.com/rosariotc@sbcglobal.net/) And I'm going to see it again this weekend--and this time I'm bringing tissues.
