The reason I started it was so that I could vent my frustrations, fears, all the emotions that wring me out every day. And I haven't been using it like I should. Lately it seems that I have hit a brick wall emotionally. I have so many things going on in my life that I can't keep track of how I should feel about anything, and old fears I thought were long dead are resurfacing, and that both scares me and pisses me off. My neice came to stay with us on the first of July. I adore this child, she is sweet and caring and artistic. She is also troubled. I am trying to make her time here as enjoyable as possible, because she feels so lonely most of the time. Anyway, on to the next thing...I have been running around being driven crazy trying to get everything ready for school. I was so excited at first, and now I am terrified. What if I don't have what it takes? What if I fail to get my degree? What if when I graduate, I can't find a job, and I have wasted all that time? Everyone keeps telling me, oh, honey, don't worry, you will be great, you are gonna succeed and all that, but I find myself suspicious of their sincerity a lot more lately. I am so tired. I am tired of everything. I am tired of being stressed, I am tired of trying, I am tired of my husband coming home and being so tired we barely have time to talk before he dozes off, I am tired of this separation anxiety that Alexx seems to be going through(I can't even leave the room to go to the bathroom half the time, because he freaks out and starts screaming bloody murder...and then he clings and if i try to lay him down, more screaming. I don't know what his deal is, and it frustrates me something awful.) I adore my kids, and my husband is the greatest man in the world, but I am so tired that I am not sure that I have the ability to appreciate them anymore. The only thing that has brightened me up lately has been my neice coming here, because I have to consciously make an effort to make sure she is okay, because I worry so much about her. I have never seen a child so sad, so lonely, so afraid that she is going to do something wrong.  I am going to quit smoking. I tested myself the other day. I went an entire day without a cigarette, and the funny thing is that I didn't lose my temper or get overly stressed that entire day. I then stretched a pack of cigarettes out through three days instead of my usual one and a half.when this pack is gone, that is it. I am done. Now that I know I have the ability to do it, I am going to. Then maybe I can convince the hubby to finally quit as well. He smokes two packs a day almost, and we simply cannot afford that anymore. Well, the kids are all asleep(even Alexx), so I am going to take a little me time, and just bask in the silence for a while...
