But I left after 1st hour because I started to feel like shit. Plus there was no reason for me to stay. I picked Michelle up and we went job hunting together. She got me a job at Jimmy Johns. I think things are changing for the better. And I'm not saying that because things are actually getting better, I'm saying that because keeping myself busy will make things seem better. I start at Jimmy Johns on Monday. I've got a great shift schedule, I'm really excited. This summer is going to be hell though. I work 5 days a week. Oh well. Keeping myself busy. I've got the evenings and nights off as well as the weekends. It will be just like school, but not; because now I get to sleep in. Oh hell yes.  I headed back for 6th hour. I swear if I'm ignored by one more guy (with the exception of David and Anil, because they're sweeties) I'm just going to blow my fucking head off. Bring it. Ignore me. I've been reclaiming the suicidal thoughts that used to overwhelm me months ago... it's no fun. I just feel so useless. I'll write more later. Maybe I'll feel like coming out about my problems then.  Back to work...
