I miss her a lot, and yeh, altho we don't talk a lot, she's been such a big help in my life, and she's always gonna be someone important to me.   AND.. I talked to my baybie boy, too! He's good.. he didn't get in trouble or anything... but he did have to go to the doctors... poor thing. But, he's got medicine.. I hope he gets better soon!  ANYWAYS, I'm all smiles now.. so yay! =)
