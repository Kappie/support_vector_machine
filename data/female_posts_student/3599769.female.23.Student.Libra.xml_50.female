So if that's not something worth jumping up and down for then I don't know what is. I'm mad busy today at work but I don't care cause I'm having Chinese buffet for lunch with Rich's mom. BONUS!!! And another bonus is he will be back in town today. U were gone too long hunny bunny. Ahh, at least I can still baby talk him on here.Last night me and Jenn attempted to go to the gym but they wanted to charge her 15.00 for one day!! Shame on you Gold's Gym! So instead we went back to my apt. and did beginners yoga from the on-demand channels. It actually soothed my aching back but today's the pain is back. I wish it would have kept raining over here but the sun keeps coming out.    Dammit, I just peeled my cuticle and its bleeding a red river. Especially when I do this... ouch.Maybe I'll bleed to death and then everyone will be sad. And they will say all the customary stuff about me when I die. Like, I was such a giving person that I would give up the shirt that I was wearing if you needed it. (In real life, it depends whether the shirt is name brand or not in which I case may have paid too much for it and I'd still like to wear it.) Or how I was so thoughtful. (Did I ever mentioned selfish in my profile?) Or how I had my whole life ahead of me and that I was someday going to become the PSYCHOLOGIST I wanted to be cause I'd like to help unyielding persons. (tru dat!) Or how i was loved by many, okay, okay considering family and close friends I would believe it if they added this in my eulogy. Well I guess today that is not a possibility cause I've already stopped bleeding. Planning my death comments will have wait, hopefully wait a realllll long time. Oh, I just remember don't you hate running into x's? Well Jenn ran into one of mine, well actually his sis, the girly is prego (me and her were really close, but due to her asshole bro I cut off all contact with thier whole fam so I wouldn't keep getting sucked back in) turns out he now lives with his gf and is leaving to the navy for 5 yrs. what a jip! I was his first serious relationship gf and now I bet he's this great guy and is prolly gonna marry this girl. C'mon who waits 5 yrs for u to come back unless your gonna get married? Once again, I've been shafted. Who cares he was a fuckin' loser anyway. Green-eyed monster, anyone? But he really was a loser. So whateva.
