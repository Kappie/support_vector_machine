Quick resume of my trip so far….Arrived here on Thursday evening didn’t sleep at all on the plane, then stayed up till late when I got here, but wasn’t that tired at all.  The flight was good, amazing views of Greenland.  Was sat next to this really old guy (he was 87 I think) who started speaking German to me. Now fortunately I can speak German and so understood him, but he didn’t know that!  Anyway he talked to me through out the entire trip all about what he thought about George Bush, the state of healthcare in Germany….. If I asked him to move so I could go to the toilet it was a 10 minute affair so I took to leaping over the back of the seats instead!    Thursday night is TV night in the Wallace household.  I was well prepared for this and had psyched myself up for a 2 hour period of silence through out Survivor and ER.  Survivor was traumatic and I hate to admit it but actually found myself getting quite involved!  We then hung around waiting for ER to start and can you believe it….THERE WAS NO ER!  I couldn’t believe it.  After all that I didn’t get chance to prove my adherence to the ER rules.    Friday I woke up at 6am for some crazy reason.  Melanie had an appointment in the afternoon so I took a look around the UBC campus.  Amazing views of the mountains and the sea…oops sorry I mean ocean.  I then decided to go down to this beach, which I was blissfully wandering along when I stumbled over a naked woman!  I discovered later that it was a nudist beach!!  Ok these Canadians are weird (not that we don’t have nudist beaches but we wouldn’t be laying their naked in April!)  Saturday Melanie and I went up to the Capilano Suspension Bridge.  As my ‘I made it’ certificate states I braved heights of 230 feet and a 450 foot span across the raging waters of Capilano Canyon.  Then we had a picnic on the beach in Stanley Park.  It was a really lovely day.  Sunday we went to church and then chilled, painted and listened to lots of crazy music.  Monday (that’s today right? I am totally confused) we read Vinyl Café stories – I am a TOTAL convert.  I love them.  Melanie reads them real good too.  This afternoon I went downtown on the bus and back again armed with Melanie’s map (without getting lost)  I wandered around Canada Place (which is this really weird building built like a sailing boat – but does have very nice loos!)  and then went to the central library to get a Vinyl Café CD – told you totally hooked.  The library is like massive and really nice inside, definitely not like England.  And everyone is so helpful and pleasant.  It’s now raining here and so I’m feeling like I’m back in England.  There are so many things which are similar but then some really different things I wouldn’t have thought of especially phrases and expressions.  Melanie and I should bring out a Canadian/English dictionary.  I keep saying store, bathroom, couch, cell phones WHAT’S HAPPENING TO ME?????  Melanie and I have decided that we should set up a second hand bookstore/coffee shop.  Melanie will do the books and I’ll serve lots of Fairtrade tea and coffee, homemade soup, and any other culinary delights I or the domestic goddess can think of.  We are going to have Vinyl Café playing and invite Stuart McLean to come and do a live reading!  Any other suggestions welcome.  Promise we won’t be in competition with your Deep Sea Chicken business Matthew.  Ok well that’s all folks…. Am off to Vancouver Island tomorrow. Take care guys.  Mexx
