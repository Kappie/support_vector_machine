(memo to self: don't wake up early). i have a pic of a flamingo on a sticky note that is stuck to my computer. wow. two things have happned this year that i thought would never happen. 1)nick west called my house. not for me but because a note in drew's yearbook said to. but he still called... and 2) mitch roberts was in my house. yes i know thats not that great but still....he is a pretty popular guy....but also a few fries short of a happy meal....if ya know what i mean (sorry if any of his friends are reading this. i dont mean to offend). aloha to y'all.
