I hadn't pulled an all nighter in years, partly because Jay is a farm kid and gets seriously perturbed if anyone discusses the idea of going to bed later than eleven and waking up after six and partly because I just don't care enough about assignments to waste my sitting around time on them.  I got slammed, with my dad and the cat and the tire and my own students taking  their  test and freaking out about it, so I wore my ass print into our ratty, pumpkin colored desk chair from 8 pm until 6 am fiddling with music engraving files and reports about tunebooks and outlines for my lecture tonight and...and it was lonely and horrible and at about three o'clock my jaw locked closed because I had been furiously clenching it for hours while I engraved music our windowless hole of office efficiency.  In the morning I went home, showered, snapped at Jay for not taking out the tower of trash and went back to work. Welcome to Grownupville, right?  Yeah...I know.  And I'm really not complaining, except during the whole day that I was bleary eyed and shivering  from the cold that always seems to partner up with fatigue and settle in the base of my spine, absolutely no one asked how I was.  It's not like I wanted the school to post  a memorial statue to me for putting off my assignments and doing them overnight, but it was pretty obvious by my four gas station coffee cups and the fortress of books I had built around the computer chair that something was up.  But...nothing.  Tayte and Marcus were just annoyed that they couldn't check their e-mail or post grades because I was still scrambling to write percussion parts ten minutes before class started.  Laira had a recital that day and brought in her fancy skirts for me to match an outfit, never noticing that I had lost my voice and kept dropping the pencil I was using to help her make her to-do list.  No one in my grad. survey saw the wan girl with black crescent moons under her eyes stop and squint through her double vision as she presented her project, but my professor did have time to take me aside and ask if I wouldn't mind penning a student letter to the editor about our school's recent legal battles and "could I get that done by tomorrow because a lot of people are counting on you to do this?"  That's the story of my life:  Capable at school but a wreck at home.  Interesting enough to be good at mindless chitchat, but maybe not interesting enough to warrant a conversation about what I really think or what's really happening in my world.  Maybe it's my fault for not trying.  I'm terrified of so many things right now:  money, my thesis, dealing with my dad's sudden, secret depression, my competition, the wedding, getting a job, that I'm afraid if someone really DID ask me how I was I'd just dissolve into the floor from the relief of admitting it.   Recently I've begun to think that if I become any more unremarkable, I might just vanish altogether like I did before I left the Very Bad School, pinned into a corner by the weight of other people's problems and the stuff that I'm going crazy trying to hide in my own world.  Scrambling like hell to maintain a facade of normalcy is hard enough, but letting my guard down and realizing no one really gives a shit what I'm thinking is worse.  That's why blogging, even in light of the privacy issues and the potential embarrassment, is still so seductive and why I logged in to Blogger every day to write and erase the writing even when I was waiting for months for my site to "cool off" and be forgotten.  When I spill out all this stuff (petty and melodramatic as it may seem to you) it proves to me that I'm still here.  I start to remember me before I became Jay's fiance or MJB's assistant.  Before I moved to the education side of music and became a joke for all my old friends in the Back East conservatories.  When I had a voice and a mind that wasn't full of politeness and educational jargon and minced words for all the stupid, political games we play at the university.  And even if those who visit my blog are only feeling polite or obligated, the fact that someone out there reads and actually responds to what I'm saying means more than twenty offices full of sympathetic grad students.  It proves that the person I used to like still exists and is worth finding again.
