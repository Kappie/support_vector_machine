I just got back from Idaho. It was a long drive back, and very hot. I don't have AC in my car, so you can imagine. My birthday is in 2 days. I'm so excited. I can't believe that i'm going to be a senior, or that i am i guess i should say. I feel too young or something. I'm sure i'll adjust though.   Ok, so i've found something to talk about. I'm visiting my cousin in a few weeks over on the east coast. I planned it so that i'll spend 15 days w/ her, get back on the first and have a few days to get back in the swing of things before school started up again. However, i didn't plan on the school district changing their usual plan of when school starts. Turns out, school is gonna start on the first, a few days BEFORE labor day, instead of the day after. This presents a problem... my plane arrives at 11:09PM on the first. So, i'm gonna miss the first few days of my senior year. But there's not much i can do at this point... well i guess there is, but there's nothing that i really WANT to do about it. My teachers are just gonna have to deal i guess. I do feel bad about choir though. I made the Jazz Ensemble at school this year, so i really need to be there for it, i might just go in for that class and then go back home... i don't know, i'll figure it out when it gets closer to that time. anyway, i hope this is a good enough post for y'all (ahem! Joanna... ahem!) Love ya Cuz!   -Ali
