I didn't even use the computer at all yesterday.  Tonight she was all mad when i already knew one of the things i was getting for my birthday: office supplies.  woo hoo. i mean that in a non-excited, sarcastic way.  i mean, those are great to have, but for a birthday gift? and she left the list sitting out on her table where i always wander to when i'm brushing my teeth.  gah! back up.  earlier that evening, we went for a nice family drive to see the school's rebuilding progress.  she got slightly injured and cried.  then she cried right after chad and i were done with gifts and hid in her room.  then she cried again when andrew and ryann had left... and has been off and on ever since as she took a bath.  the worst place to cry cause there's already so much water and the walls just make the sobs echo.  AAAAHHHH i realize i'm only going to be here one more day, but seriously, what is wrong with her?
