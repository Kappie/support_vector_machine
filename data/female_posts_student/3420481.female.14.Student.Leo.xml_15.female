When we got to the VFW we ate and this one guy cleared our plates when he was done. He had really bad B.O. He kind of smelled like Pizza. It was so nasty. After we ate we went home for like fifteen minutes and then got in the car to go to Wal-Mart, Maurices, and Pick 'N Save. I got these awesome Polo shoes at Maurices. They are so cool and they are the kind that I can wear to school. I'm so excited! When we got back home I got on the internet but then left after like only fifteen minutes so I could eat. I had chile cheese fritos and a peanut butter sandwich. While I ate I watched a movie called "Big" starring Tom Hanks. It was so good. After I was done eating (the movie was still playing) I did part of my math homework. When I got to this one problem I started having problems so I decided that I'd go in during the morning and ask for help. After the movie was over I did my laundry and got in the bath tub so I could shave my legs. They were REALLY hairy. I mean total man legs. I actually found it kind of funny. When I got out of the shower I got on the internet to work on todays quotes and talk to Kirsten. Then I started getting this awful pain in my side and down where my appendix are. I thought it was gone but then I started to eat my dinner and it came back again so I layed down and watched T.V. When it got so bad I couldn't stand to lay down any longer I decided I should take some aspirin so I did and within about half an hour it was gone. But then it came back AGAIN! That was after my dad decided he wanted to lay on me. It was kind of weird. The last thing of importance that I did this night was drink a strawberry kiwi smoothie. YUM YUM! Now my pains are all gone and I hope they stay this way because they hurt. BAD.
