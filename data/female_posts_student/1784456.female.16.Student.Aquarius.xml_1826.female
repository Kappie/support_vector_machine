Kt where were u last nite. we had soo much fun at anna's body shop party, or at least i did! U no the whole phone tree idea for when organising things? I tried to make one up but its really difficult to do it cos i dont have evryone's number and there are certain people who only talk to certain others and getting it to go in a circle is very difficult. Cos i dont want people calling someone elses house unless they are really familiar with the household they are calling! Do u wanna have a go? also ne news on bus times for sunday?
