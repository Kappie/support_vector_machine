Very good response, if you live in Nebraska, give them a ring, they do good work.  Anyway, today I'm striving to expand my mind, I'm reading up on Cascading Style Sheets. I'm an old HTML horse, and CSS is too new for me, however I know how XML works, figure that out :P  So I'm surfing the sites about CSS, so that I can practice with it so I can put up the Phoenix Perch Website, which once I do, will be linked here. It's content obviously going to be more static than the information you can find here. Things like my Resume, and Flash Apps and such :D Looking forward to doing some Flash type stuff, I might even make animated EQ comics, who knows, depends on how much time I dedicate to playing with flash apps.  I'll let you know the progress on the website as it happens. till then.   Try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix
