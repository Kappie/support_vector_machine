So heres my theory which a friend helped my write:           What people now days call "going out" means that you claim eachother and are temporarily stuck to somebody for usually a long period of time in which u probally decide you don't even like this person BUT you don't want to break things off because it would be too much of a mess. So going out is basically a pointless, rather stupid thing that ends in a mess. Dating, however, is so much better! When you date, you're not really making a commitment you're just having fun. And then if you decide you don't like the person then you just don't answer their calls and you move on! Man I give good advice!               On the dating subject- as I was goin to bed last night I was thinking about what kinda guy would be right for me and i came up with a list of some things i like in a guy and some thingsI don't like! So here it is:          Top 5 things I like in a guy          1.Funny! I'm a happy person I like to laugh!     2.Respectful to parents and to me     3.Christian or just an all around good guy     4.Nice hair and pretty eyes- oh and they hafta smell good!     5. and a country boy preferably or an austrailian accent!          oo ok when u comment gimme your list of things u like in a girl or guy!
