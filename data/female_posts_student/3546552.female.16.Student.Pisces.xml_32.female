Well yeah, now that I've shared that most  uninteresting, un-understandable  fact with you...we'll just be moving on. So I started the book  Purpose Driven Life  tonight,and I was wondering...no nvm, that joke is sooooo overused, haha. Well just one more thought b4 I head to bed...why does no one write me comments anymore? I really miss having little happy notes to read...*sad face* ...and roses to look at...*tear* all of them just let me know that some one is thinking about me...*sniffle* lol, well anyway, maybe you can write a comment that would make me feel better! goodnight. ~BS
