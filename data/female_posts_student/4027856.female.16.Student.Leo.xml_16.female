What  I do remember is my little group of friends sitting around the lunch table reading parts of it and giggling like little school girls. Good times for all. Well I am back from NY in 6 days. Nicole is picking me up being the good friend that she is. The rest of my week consists of going to see "Raising Helen" and "The Village", ; a trip to either Alantic City, The Reneissence Festival or Dorney Park. Also work and shopping of course....maybe I could get a new pair of shoes. So I am trying to make the best of this week...bc it will be a couple of months till I am up again...and then nxt year I shall LIVE HERE mwah hahahaha lol But Exciting news...I got an art internship for next year. Right here in New York...and I get pay aswell. It is a very exciting for me bc I have been thinking about my future recently and I have this big fear that I am going to be stuck in an office and do nothing with my life. Its a scary prospect and then this popped up and I'm like hey I have something to work for thats pretty much settled ya know...so its a good thing...I'm excited
