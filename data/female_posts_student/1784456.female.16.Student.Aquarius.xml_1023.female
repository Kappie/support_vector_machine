As my brother put it, 'You never think the same again.' and that's true. You get really freaked! Basically, the scary point about it is that this guy hates the strict dictatorship he's under and wants to break out of it. So he's thinking about breaking out of it and going to do some thing about it, but he can't because of the 'Thought Police' who are supposed to pick out trouble makers and get rid of people trying to go against the dictatorship. So he starts a diary, which is prohibited, and he thinks he's got past the Thought Police... but he hasn't. Aww, the ending's sad. Big Brother is watching you. ...(Don't question the pointlessness of this!)
