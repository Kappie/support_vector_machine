They're all very full of hippylumberjackosity.  We played bad-mitten for a while, I, in all my coordination, fell and got soaking wet.  Cabe's sucha tease most of the time.  He kept blowing in my ears at unappropiate times.  Actuualy he was full of unapropriateosity tonight.  We played capture el flago, or, more to the point, Char did.  Cabe and I phsudo-played.  I got home fairly late, but the rents had gone out to some party anyway.  fine with me.     xxxxxooooooooooo   -KIWIOSITY
