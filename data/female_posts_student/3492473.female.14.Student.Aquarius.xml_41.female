I called Annie once I got up because her and I had some sort of conversation last night and we needed to continue it. So we talked for awhile but I had to get off the phone because my uncle came over and I was just sitting there in my pajamas and on the phone. He needed some glasses my bro had in his glove compartment for work so my mom gave him the keys and he went to get them. Now, he doesn't like animals at all.  Especially not dogs.  But I have two  lovely  dogs who like jumping on everyone so I had fun watching my uncle trying to get my dogs off of him. And Sandy is pretty tall when she stands on her back legs! LoL! So then he asked if he could call my grandpa and my mom said to use my use that was next to the computer, upside down. And my uncle being the  smart  one he is, asked if it was a cell phone! I was like WTF? And he tried pulling up the antena but there was none. He asked me how to turn it on but he changed his mind and went to use the normal phone in the kitchen.  Oh well.  So then I just sat online talking to people til 4. Then I read CH 11 of LOTF. One more chapter left! Fuck yeah! LoL! But then I still gotta read Tom Sawyer.  Lucky me.  Then I ate and got ready for soccer. Soccer wasn't too bad tonight. I ran the warm up mile without stopping again!  So yay to me.  Then we did the normal crap except we usually have 3 men teams but today we have 2 men teams. Which means you go faster and don't get much of a break. Later we did these crazy cone things. Coach lined the cones up on their sides like a ladder. We had to jump over them in different ways. But it was so funny because everyone kept doing the one way completely different. And Mr. Willis would like tease someone if they hit a cone and say, "Stop kicking my cones." I dunno, to me,  that seemed like the first time I felt comfortable with everyone.  I dunno why it was then, it's just what I felt. And thank god, we didn't do our cool down mile. We just did de-gessions. Which weren't bad. Came home and read Seventeen. Then I watched Newlyweds and the Ashlee Simpson show. I really like Ashlee and her show. She's really pretty. Now I'm here. I'm sorta sore from soccer so I can't wait til tomorrow. LoL, well it's not that bad. The miles are the worst and when my chest tightens up and I only get a little oxygen. And soccer is the only time that I seem to stop thinking about  *something*  So that's good because I can't stop thinking of that thing at all through the day.  Even my dreams are about it.  Any who, here's a good quote:  "When you're happy on the inside, you're beautiful on the outside."  Don't you like that? I do! And here's a poem. Hope you like. The poem is just about liking someone again and the events that go with it.  HEY! START COMMENTING! I WANNA KNOW WHAT YOU THINK!             Up to You   my memory is starting to fade, as the feeling is slipping way. so where are you now? why aren't you here? i want you back, and i think you want me too. my friends say you do, but it's something i need to hear for myself. so take the next step,
