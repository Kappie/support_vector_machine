School is getting somewhat hectic. Not bad, but you know, sometimes things get annoying after a while.  There's so much I need to do...I missed the last SAT sign up date, so I need to do that, and school ends in May...so I gotta prep for AP exams and all that good stuff. I can't believe I'm almost gonna be a senior.  I have so much to think about...such asapplying for even more scholarships and visiting campuses, and finalizing what I'm gonna major in (even though I have a good idea of what that's gonna be. More later on that topic, because I've gotten WAY off track!)  Blindside's new album:  About a Burning Fire ...(for anyone that's listened to it), like or dislike?  I like it :) I can't determine favorite songs yet...because I've had a chance to listen, but not REALLY listen in depth, but they've made some interesting developments as far as their style as compared to the last albums.  Oh, I'll need to post my paper once I add some stuff to it! I turned what I had in and got an A, but there are still some categories I personally want to add in.  For anyone who doesn't know, it's a paper classifying high school students.  I was rather stereotypical in classifying groups, mainly to make a point.   Everything else will have to wait! I have stuff I need to do...
