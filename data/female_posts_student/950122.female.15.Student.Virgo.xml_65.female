(As if I could even find it) I'm just.. so... ergh.  I had a dress rehearsal with my mom last sunday. When I was wearing everything, I was just looking at myself in the mirror. I told her I wanted to win the Stag of the Night award, and she said nothing. Not even a nod. She just looked at the dress. She didn't say  anything . It was so horrible; even a shred of recognition would have been ok, but she showed nothing. I took my dress off and hung it in my brother's closet. As I wiped the make-up from my face, I couldn't help but wonder if I really am the source of all her stress. Looking back on the past week, it doesn't look good at all. She doesn't speak to me. She doesn't greet me when I come home and greet her. Geez, not even at the dinner table. I can't help but think that she hates me or something. I know I'm probably over reacting, but with the way things are...   God, please prove me wrong.
