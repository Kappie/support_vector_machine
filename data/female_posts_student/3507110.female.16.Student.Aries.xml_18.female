Bend me, warp me, twist me until I can't breathe. It's okay, keep going. I'm here for you to scream at when you need to scream, I'm here for you to hurt when you need to hurt. Let me bleed for you, let me be in pain for you. I don't mind. Visit me in the middle of the night when I'm sleeping and wake me up just to fill me up with your sorrows. I'll take you in my arms and hold you until you stop and then I'll kiss you and tuck you into bed. I won't mind. I don't ask for anything in return, I'm yours to abuse. My body is here, my soul is near, and I'm ready to be beaten. I don't mind. Let your weight fall on me and let me be crushed because it's what I'm here for. I'll hand you the knife, I'll stand still while you shove it past the skin, through the layers of tissue and muscle, through my bones, and into my heart. Let me bleed in front of you, just let the blood flow and spill all over me and you and the floor. Let it pool under our feet and soak the carpet. Every once in awhile, I'll need a break but if during that time you need me, I'll stop and I'll let you cling to me. I'm your pillow you scream into, I'm the wall you punch your fists through. I am the one destined for this, don't feel bad. I don't mind. I never scream, I never cry, I am nothing. I am empty. The world passes by this old soul. The leaves may change color, may die, may be reborn, and I am witness to the death of that which surrounds me. I watch them decay, watch the ties that bind them rot under old age. I watch their tears, I know that which they fear, I am the silent guardian. This taste in my mouth won't ever go away, I'll remember it. I'll wait in the driveway for the comfort that will never come. I'll stand silent through the wind, the rain, and the storms to see you, until all the blood has left me and I am nothing but a hollow, pale shell of a human being. But that's not what scares me. What frightens me is what time will do to you. Please, shape me anyway you want, hurt me over and over again until I can't stand, hit me, punch me, rape me, but please don't leave me. I don't want to let go of you, I don't want you to let go of me. This can't be the end. Please, please, please, please, do anything you want to me but please please please please don't forget me here. Don't leave me here forever, please. I'm on my hands and knees bleeding all over the place for you. Please remember me, please remember what I feel like, please don't let this be the end. I can't stand for it to be the end. I never scream, I never cry, I am nothing. But I can beg because nothing in itself is something. I love you and I'm lost but at least I can be lost with you.
