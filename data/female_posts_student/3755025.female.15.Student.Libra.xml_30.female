(big whoop!) sure im happy for them.... kinda.. but all it means to me is that i have the whole day off since they will be gone to dinner and all that fun stuff.. so i could go set the town ablaze and they'd have no idea.. but thats the fun part! :-D yea.. and as of last night.. i can add another tally mark to the list of mental breakdowns.. i have no idea what its from.. but im determined to find out, and also thanks a ton heather for bein there! i dunno what i wouldve done.. at least i got to talk to someone (face to face and not on the retarded computer) but thanks for that.. and i also listened to that one song...it helped! lol  mood: awake...ish music: take me out-franz ferdinand
