I had a weird dream about school last night. A little too weird for my taste.  I get to spend some quality shopping time with cassie today. That'll be fun. Getting drunk on Chai Laittes and buying random crap. Man, that's my kinda good day. To insure a good day, I'm wearing my fun pink skirt and matching braclet. And of course my kick ass drama shirt I got from states. Ah states. That was fun. Pink pony tails top off my outrageous outfit. Man. I'm sooo ready for that Chai. *snore* Oasis is good to listen to if you're not happy. It's loud, so it takes over your mind, but it's not like heavy metal. You can actually listen to it. And I love the lead singers voice.  Time to put on the happy mask to hide the streaks of mascara running down my face. I have made my choice.
