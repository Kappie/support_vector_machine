Waaaaaa. *sad* If only I would have studied a little more for my last test. I am filled with these "if onlys" But, I didn't try hard enough so I guess its my fault.  The grades I know for sure of right now are: PE: A Preforming Arts: A Spanish: A- English: A  Thats all I am sure of right now, so I guess thats pretty good.  But I could have done so much better than I did this semester. I just didn't try hard enough.  *sighhh*  We have a ton of people coming over in  a half an hour so the whole house has to be absolutely perfect. Its kinda annoying. I can't do anything!!!  We went to nordstrom today. I tried on a ton of stuff that was on sale but I ended up buy stuff that wasn't on sale. Haha. This always happens! I tried on a really cute skirt but my mom said it was to short. "no me gusta la moda de faldas cortos"   (I don't like the fashion of short skirts!)  I also got some really cute MAC lip stick! The lady at the counter was like "Oh! it looks so prettty!" And it does...I was just staring at myself in the mirror and I was like "why do I get pretty the last day of school?" It always works that way, but its all good. I got a really cute pink tank top with a little flower on it. :)  I saw one of my orthodontist helper persons at the mall. It was scary! She probably knew I swallowed one of my spacers, they are scary like that.
