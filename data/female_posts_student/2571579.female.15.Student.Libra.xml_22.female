So yeah now i'm talking with some people about somethings. love lifes ect. i usually say that i dont have one but if you know me you know who i like. I think i'm gonna have to wait sometime for him to figure shit out so i'm not going to be like a pain in the ass, or ill try not to at least. but i would like to hang out with him more =\   now for a good quote.."but to wait for you, well that's all I can do and that's what I've got to face" .. there's more but w.e. The song is  Gavin DeGraw- Against All Odds   and it's an awesome song.   xoxo--kacey
