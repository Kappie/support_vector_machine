And then, I chuckled to myself, because in my 23 years on this earth, I have never gotten stuck in an elevator. So, who knows when something like that would actually happen to me?!  Well, what do you know? It happened today, just six hours after I read this article. I entered one of the Tower II elevators on the lobby floor, pressed the button for the 20th floor, and watched the elevator doors close behind me. After a couple of seconds, I realized that the elevator, which had originally been moving, had, for some reason, ceased to move.  Uh oh. So, immediately, I thought back to that article about good ol' Katie and I reminded myself to stay cool. I frantically (yeah, I'm so cool, I'm ice) scanned the elevator buttons for the "call for help" button. I finally find it. At the bottom of all the buttons. I sit down on the elevator floor (getting ready for what would hopefully not be a long wait) and press the button.  After a minute or so, someone finally answers. Thank god. I tell the help guy about my predicament - "I'm stuck between floors." He tells me he'll see what's up and promptly hangs up on me. And, of course, I think to myself, "What the hell am I supposed to do now?" Well, thankfully, the elevator starts moving.   I'm so glad that I'm such a frequent reader of the gossip columns. If I hadn't read that article today, I would never ever have known what to do today. But, because of the National Enquirer and Katie Couric, I stayed calm, cool, and collected in a stuck elevator today. Go me!
