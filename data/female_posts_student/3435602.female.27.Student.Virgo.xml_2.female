Common cold 200, Silvana 0  Classes were interesting to say the least a discussion on gastrointestinal pediatric cases.  All cases sounded very similar to each other, child shows up and is irritable in the emergency room.  The symptoms described were so vague and my studying not so in depth that I could not think of the potential diagnosis.  Neither could most of my classmate, the professor was starting to get irritated "c'mon guys, the exam is on Friday" it is a "classic presentation for intussusception", "classic!", and somebody turns to me and asks what is intussusception?  As my usual perusing of news occurred today I stumbled onto possibly one of the most important  urlLink news  items of our age, apparently somebody after taking a look at illnesses such as HIV, cancer and antibiotic resistant tuberculosis decided that our efforts and research funds should really be focused on studies about how much bacteria doctors carry on their ties.  Now, if that is not earth shattering I don't know what is.  The news item carefully explains how previous studies have shown that doctors carry germs on their hands, clothing and pencils.  But could ties also carry germs?  I was really under the impression that ties were made of magical, germ repelling substances but to my surprise ties were found to carry potentially "evil" germs.  The author of the study suggests that ties be banned from the realm of health care while the author of the news article suggested that doctors start wearing bow ties (wouldn't that be sexy?).  I have a better suggestion as the fashion adviser of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy pointed out why not wear ties as belts, now that is something that would perhaps be more hygienic and launch medicine as one of the most fashionable professions out there.  Now that problem has been solved and somebody found the cause of bad hair days, apparently a gene called  urlLink frizzled , stupid frizzled!  I feel safe in the hands of science, maybe genetic engineering will come and solve the problem at the very root.
