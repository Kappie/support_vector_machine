I love him and I know that he loves me too. He cares for me as I care for him and there's nothing more I can ask of him. I love him so much. This... is different. Different from what I had with Wilfred. This is more than that. At first, I thought that I wouldn't like a guy my age for a while because guys my age are so immature, but I guess I was wrong. Nima is probably the most mature guy in grade 8. I love him. He's the best thing God has blessed me with. He's perfect. Beyond perfect yet perfection beyond description. When I tell him I love him, I mean it. Always.   [Of all the things I regret, sometimes I forget to say... I love you]  Nima, if you're reading this, I want you to know that I really do mean it when I say I love you. I don't ever say things that I don't mean unless it's to wastebucket or Lohan or anyone else I hate but never to you. Don't ever forget... Je t'aime... jamais n'oublie pas. C'est vrai.  I talked to Alice today and she gave Vivo and I permission to talk to Safee. I think he's upset. But you know what? He deserves all this... he should stop doing what Alice tells him not to do. He continues to flirt and stuff. I told him to keep his distance from girls and I hope he stops. Alice deserves better than him... really. Gonna pray for her.  Well, I should start packing to pick people up to band practise. Adios.
