Now before any of you rake me over the coals for some or all of my choices, let me remind you that this is my opinion. You mention in your last post that the debut season of  Deadwood  is not yet over so you cannot yet make that proclamation. Well I have not seen  Deadwood  so I cannot cast my opinion in either direction on that show. As for the five that I mentioned, I feel that in looking at the current season's they have gone through I must say that  The OC  nudges out  The Shield  for the top spot. Even though there are three episodes left in an already exhilarating season of  The Shield , I felt  The OC  was stronger. No show, that I have seen, meshes comedy and drama better. It's ability to make you laugh is uncanny, but it's ability to touch you on an emotional level is what sets it aside from all the rest. I believe that everyone see's part of themselves in some character on the show. I myself am a Ryan, a truly good heart but an uncanny ability to get myself into trouble.  Now let me clear up some things that you took out of context or didn't interpret correctly from my last post. 1)  I disagree with the extent of your praise for Josh Schwartz. He's a gifted writer and adaptable producer, but to position him on the verge of Quentin Tarantino, after only 27 episodes seems reckless.  I said in my post that I believe that he will soon be placed in the Quentin Tarantino category. What I meant by this was that throughout his first season he often showed signs of tremendous brilliance in his writings. I do believe that he has the potential to reach that platform, but he has not yet reached it. He does have more to prove, but no writer that I can think of(not even your beloved Charlie Kaufman) has started as strong as Josh. 2)  Disney, under Eisner, has agreed to sell the film back to the Bob and Harvey Weinstein, who are free to find another distributor for the film.  When I said that Eisner has done everything in his power to keep this movie out of theaters I was 100% accurate. Eisner has been back into a corner, by the press and the public, and had no choice but to sell the rights to Harvey and Bob Weinstein.  3) If Eisner is afraid of Jeb Bush withholding tax breaks that are being given to Walt Disney World, doesn't that mean that in some way, shape or form that George W. Bush is his candidate. Isn't Dubya essentially having his brother buy the votes of Disney's board of directors. In all honesty, I may be wrong, but this is the particular spin that I have chosen to put on  Fahrenheit 9/11  topic.  Okay! On to creativity. I had a little trouble thinking of who my next post would revolve around. As I was walking around late at night, trying to find a movie that I wanted to fall asleep to, I saw my next post sitting on my windowsill. Undeniable creativity lies within the pages of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Now my love for both the books and the movies causes me to write this post in a different format.   The Books . It was only two days after Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was released in theaters when I went out and purchased the book. It took me all of two days to read it. It is without a doubt the most creative thing that I have ever read or heard about. Harry Potter is a book that appeals to all ages, from my 80 year old grandmother, to my 7 year old niece tiffany, to me, a 23 year old single guy. J.K. Rowling has created a whole new world that you can't help but get lost in. Places like Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where young witches and wizards go to learn the magical arts. Diagon Alley, where wizards can find anything they need from a new wand to a brand new racing broom. As the title states, the series revolves around the exploits of young Harry Potter. Harry became one of the most famous wizards of the last millennium when as a baby he amazingly defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort. The books are also centered around Harry's two best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron and Hermione are just as intriguing as Harry, but most importantly they add a great deal of depth to both Harry and the story in general. There are so many vital characters that I cannot possibly talk about them all. You have Hagrid the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, Profesor Severus Snape the Potions teacher and head of Slytherin House, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Dursley, Draco Malfoy who is Harry's biggest rival(with the one exception being Voldemort), Albus Dumbledore the Headmaster at Hogwarts and the greatest wizard of the last century. The list goes on and on. I haven't even mentioned some of my favorite characters. If anyone ever said that J.K. Rowling lacked creativity I would be forced to thrash them.    The Movies.  It wasn't until I saw the first movie that I decided to read the books. The movies are so special that it made someone who didn't really read for pleasure want to read them. The casting has been incredible for this movie, and I'm not talking about all the big British stars they have put in it, but for the virtual unknowns they cast in the lead roles. Daniel Radcliffe is so charming and so amazing in the emotional role of Harry that you find yourself getting so attached to him and really feel for him because of all the tragedies in his life. Rupert Grint, who plays Ron Weasley, has his role down. The goofy and gangly sidekick is truly endearing as the youngest boy in an all wizarding family. You get a real sense of determination out of Ron, a determination to get out from the shadows of all his brothers. And then you have Emma Watson. Emma had never acted before she auditioned for the role of Hermione Granger, which is astounding because she has stolen many scenes in the first two movies and I am sure she will continue to do the same throughout the series. Watson was a huge fan of the book, I even read that she had memorized all of Hermione's quotes from the first book, and she still is. Although I believe Hermione to be probably the funnest role to play, it also is one of the most difficult. The right combination of attitude, intelligence and sass can't be easy to find. My hat is off to all three young stars. The movie is also great because it stay so true to the book that nearly all the quotes used in the book are used in the script. With a movie like  Harry Potter  it is so important to stay true to the story because the fans absolutely love the books, and with J.K. holding creative control over the movies, they no doubt will be great adaptations. The only question that I have for the Movies yet to come is whether Michael Gambon can fill the huge shoes left by Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore.  Seriously though, I think my post has ran a little long. I will touch in on your distain for the state of the magazine world next time. Sorry, I can tend to get a little involved when I talk about Harry Potter. Until next time, this is Nick signing out.
