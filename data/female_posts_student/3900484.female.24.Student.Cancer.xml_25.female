I had to throw it out. How do you predict something like that? So I am now subsisting on my Ched 'R' Bites and medium cherry-limeade until I can go to dinner with my fam again. It sounds ominously like a repeat of last Sunday. I'm not going to let them bitch me out though, this Sunday. I'm debating whether to munch my protein bar I had intended to eat before running...  3 Revelations that have occurred to me:  1. I have to buy another binder. I allready have 4, but my chem lab manual won't fit in with my chem lecture paper. 2. I need to start a word journal. That's about as exciting as it sounds, but if its gonna help me get where I need to be, I can handle it. (In preparation for the  urlLink GRE  this Oct.) 3. 8 Quarters fit inside my belly-button. I do not wish to tell you how I came by this knowledge, just that it is there.
