I'm sure Laurenwill when she comes online, and I can probs convince Alison (who may not come online again tonight), but I have my doubts abuot Rachel. I want her to join but I don't think she'll want to. Anyway, if you want to see our group blog  urlLink click here . I don't really have anything particularly interesting to say today. I think I am improving on the Chris thing, but I have slipped up several times today but Lauren was here to point it out. It may be annoying, but she's helping me! It's for my own good! So thanks Lauren :D  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx
