I started what I hope to be the first of many outdoor restoration attempts at my mom’s house, to explain, I am helping remove some ugly plants from the side of my mom’s house to make way for a nicer landscape. I am also looking forward to going back to school in around 3 weeks. I am looking forward to going back and spending my time learning new things. I am also contemplating quitting my job as a student assistant for a local state agency to work at a local shop/store so I can make more time for school but at the same time still be able to work to make a little bit of income. I was also considering seeing if I could get a job at the school I attend in their childcare center or in an after school program at a local elementary school, that way I can work part-time while I am at school and gain experience in a field I am interested in working in. In other news I am still very happy in hearing that Jesse will be able to come home in October. I know I keep talking about this but the fact of the matter is that knowing just enough to know he will get to come home is all I really need. It gives me something to look forward to that really means something, I mean the joy of a new school semester wares off after time but the knowledge of knowing that someone you love is soon to come home, even if it is for two weeks, that is joy that doesn’t fade, because after he has come and go I get to move onto the fact that he will only be away for a short time longer. I guess I would have to admit knowing that he is coming home soon is what motivates me to deal with everything life has to throw at me because I know it could be a whole lot worse then it is, I mean he might not be able to come home at all. But I don’t want to think about that.   Any way things are going ok all things considering and I guess my life is pretty good considering what changes Jesse and I have had to make. I always ask Jesse how things are there for him and he really tries to be as brief as possible by saying things like “ok” or, “eh, they could be better” and when I ask him why he says, “never mind” I guess he just doesn’t want to burden me with those types of things, but sometime he needs to vent and I hope he understands that I will always be here to listen or in most cases read his problems. This change in life for both of us has given us a new sense of understanding and a new found appreciation for the life that has been given to us and our relationship with each other and because of the plate that has been served to us, I now have a full understanding of what it means to truly love someone as much as I love Jesse.  That is my vent for tonight.
