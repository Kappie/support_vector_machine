But that's ok, who cares if little old me dies?  Nobody!  ... Our Beatles thing was good!  I liked it a lot!  Sally did so awesome on her solo!  I was so proud!   After we were done singing I went to Taco Bell with Kyle, Amanda, and Christian!  Yummy Yummy Yummy I got food in my tummy!  I love that place so much!  It reminds me of Ryan O'Connell and poofed meat!  (hehe)  When I got home Bob, Frank, Karina, and Lori were over!  But they had to leave just as I was getting home!  It made me really sad! ... I was starting to worry about everyone liking Mark more than they like me, but I guess there is no need for me to worry!  Frank told me that he likes us both equally!  And Bob and Sean told me they like me more!  Woo!  It made me happy!   Why does Lori like Mark so much?  What does she see in him?  I don't understand!
