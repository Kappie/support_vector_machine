As for the rest of you, I would appreciate it if you would keep something in mind: I WANT TO BE INVOLVED WHEN YOU PLAN SOMETHING.  Period and sign.  Even if you think I won't be able to come, ASK.  ALWAYS MAKE SURE.  This is a rule that I thought was already in existence.  I asked Will to help me out on this note, and if not for him, I would have been screwed because half the time I have no idea what Aristotle is talking about.  Plus, I know something that could help us understand one of the essays, unless you already know about it, but to find out, I'll have to be there.  PLEASE don't ignore me anymore.  I'm already insecure enough with all the problems in my life and I wish I could be certain of something: your friendship.  I will be back on the Blog regularly now.  My traveling is over and my computer is alive and kicking.  Don't you guys remember what happened the last time you snubbed me?  The movie thing last year?  Let me just say that my parents are much more relaxed with me now.  If I told Mom I wanted to detonate a nuclear bomb in downtown Nashville, my mom would say, "Sure.  Just don't forget you radiation suit and leave one for me, too."  Well, not really, but she is letting me do a lot more than I ever could.  Let me also mention that I can DRIVE.  No car yet, but that will change soon.  I'm really sorry that I'm raking you guys over the coals about this.  But I'm really, truly begging here.  I have enough things to worry about.    Sigh.  I'm sorry.  I had a meeting with Daddy Dearest and he is STILL refusing to get me a car until I "have more experience."  Well, he might be justified, but he's still being a prick.  I want to get more experience in MY car, not my mom's car that I will never be driving.  So.  Anyway, he got me a small tape recorder, which does make him better in my eyes, since it's going to (hopefully) help with my writing.  Sometimes if I say it, it works.  But then I forget it, and if I try to write it down, it doesn't work.  So...I need to get back to my kick-ass (literally) DVD of The Last of the Mohicans.  Sorry about the tongue-lashing again, and I hope you don't think I was over-reacting, but I thought I told you when I'd be back.  I know I told SOMEONE, not sure who, though.  But I'm over it now.  I just needed to release that into the cosmos so next time I can say you were warned. ;)  Someone please help me.  ~Z
