I want a list of who looks at that...  anyway, guess what! there was a car accident in front of the Pro today! it freaked me out a lot. I was just standing with Ki, not doing anything, maybe twenty minutes after I got there, and we hear this Screech and Crash! I look outside, and this black truck is rolling into the lot with a busted front light, and another car, just sitting int he road, completely Written off.  So, this guy (mr.Black truck) was looking for a pot to park in the lot. Meanwhile, Jamie Heath, in the car, is coming into town. So, Mr.Black decides to pull into the lot, across the oncoming lane, not looking to see that theres a car coming. this is where Jamie Hits the brake (hence the screech) but it's too late. mr.Black doesn't clue in intime until he's rammed into the side of Jamies car. Now, theres another contrubutor. A guy was delivering stuff for the store, and his cube van was parked by the road so, when Jamie's car was smashed in the side, the car was side into the cube van, wrecking the other side of the car as well, and banging the van, knocking the guy standing inside off his feet. and there was a lot of glass. some old guy cleaned it up, nice guy.  anyway, theres the story of the night. anything else would be nothing compared to that. it was wierd though, since that's the first time thats happened to me while I'M working. phew, good thing Ki was there. he called the cops over, and it was taken care of in about an hour or so. but, man, Mr.Black (I don't know his name) had two little girls in the car with him, his daughters, and they came into the store and were quiet all the while, poor kids. I know all about that. aww Min. He offered them some popsicles. Min's a good guy. I'm glad he's my boss, as well as Ki. brothers are cool. anyway, TA
