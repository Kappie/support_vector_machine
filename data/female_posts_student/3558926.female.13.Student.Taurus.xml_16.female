HA HA HA I DID IT AGAIN!!!!! whoo! this is sooo awesome!! ha ha ha! oohh. now im sad. im moving. i dont want to. and this sum*41 song isnt helping the mood either. ahh poo. hahaha! that helped! ahh poo. mmm pie. oohh. now im sad again. booger. hehe. ohh. now my stomach hurts. i think i laughed too much. this sucks. and im scared about the first day of school. i dont want to have to ask someone where something is and look stupid or get lost and look even more stupid. i only sorta know one person there and he's going into highschool so that sucks. he would have helped me. i guess im having new kid anxiety....if there is such a thing. i dont want school to start. i need help.
