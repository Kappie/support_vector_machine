Dogs slobber all over you as long as you keep them fed. They’re also great at rolling over, playing dead and begging. Just like democrats.   Cats are supercilious self serving pricks who thank you for feeding them by shitting in your house. Just like a republican.   Then again, maybe democrats are kangaroos and republicans are eagles. Just thinking out loud here.
