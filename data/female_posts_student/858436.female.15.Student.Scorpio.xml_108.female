We went to his house first for     tails (no, I wasn't allowed one haha) and then we went to the restaurant. His wife, Sari, was so cool! So chic and fashionable... but with that kind of money it's hard not to be. So we had a great dinner at this really nice steakhouse.. and they served me wine!!! Muhaha. So then Sari was like well where to next?! So we went to this neat martini bar named Duvic's where I had a coke lol. Then finally around midnight we went to the hotel.  This trip was so much fun. I've discovered that my dad was absolutely wild in college haha, and it was all just so much fun. I don't want to leave! But.. I am ready to be back home tonight.  See ya!
