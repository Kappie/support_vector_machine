They have a pool so we pretty much just swam all day and I got kind of sunburnt, but it's all good. Their dog attacked me though! It was this huge fancy gigantic thing that kept eating my arm.. surprised I still have my arm! I had teeth marks all over me yesterday but they're gone now and I've survived. Today I did my country club thing. Tomorrow I'm off, Thursday I'm country clubbing and Friday babysitting the Klostermans again.  Funny how people promise you they'll call you to do stuff over the summer and you never hear from them..  I'm glad that I have my horses. Riding is my passion and it's always been a refuge for me. Something in this world that I can actually do right. Since it seems nobody has faith in me in anything else.
