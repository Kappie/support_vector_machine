So he heads to Blake's house, and they're riding down the road in Blake's truck, with Megan crying in the front seat, and Blake's dad (a convicted child molester who has also put a $10,000 life policy out on Blake and his brother and then hired someone to have them killed) was behind them to make sure Megan didn't get out.  When my uncle got there, she had been beat around pretty bad, but she wouldn't come with him.  We think he threatened her pretty bad.  He's really mad because Tisa (the other one who just had a baby) saw him at a football game the other night and embarrased him in front of his friends and because Megan left without his permission and wouldn't talk to him and stuff.  We have no idea where Blake took her, nor do we know if she's still alive.  So yeah, my family's really screwed up right now.
