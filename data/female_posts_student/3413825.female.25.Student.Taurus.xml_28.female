Some f*nut must have thrown a rock through our window. Who the hell would do that to us? We have no friends or enemies in Luton! Everyone we hang out with live in London. Let me just tell you one thing. LUTON SUX!!! it is the worst place! Ha- so at least you guys wont want to come and visit me. Anyway, had a nice weekend in Sheffield. But I somehow managed to pull a muscle in my back and it hurts like shit!! So I dont know what to do and all i want is sympathy. What do you do for a pulled muscle?? Never had one before...
