My dad picked me up from work and told me we had another tornado. We didn't have an damage around our place. My aunt Claire got it bad at her place. Her house is now on the ground. They were in the house when the tornado hit the house and it landed face first on the ground. No one was serious hurt. They were more in shock then anything. The house fell on the truck. At the time that this had happened. My Aunt was in the hall on the way to the living room. She fell into my cousin's bed room. My uncle had just finished supper and was in the kitchen. He fell against the oven and the table and fridge door fell on him. My cousin Serge and his girlfriend was in the living room at the time. My cousin Serge had a cut on his nose. Everyone else just had sore muscles. I will scan the pic that was in the newspaper and have it on my photo page by Friday. I will not be in color but in black and white. I will try to get one in color. Anyways I have to get some sleep right now. Have a good day.
