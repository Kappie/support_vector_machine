I got a bottle of Hpnotiq and that makes me oh so very very very very veryvery happy.  This guy I met from Cedar Hill wants to hang out and drink it with me but I think this bottle is gonna be saved for the  girls.   Too bad I don't have any Hennessey to compliment it oh so nicely.  :)  Oh and I got my schedule, but I don't feel like posting it on here right now...so maybe later.  It's a bitch though, I'll tell you that.  :)  Oh well.  :) :) Crazies.
