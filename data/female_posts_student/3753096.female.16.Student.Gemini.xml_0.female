Tell them the story of the frog and his wig," or something like that.  I worked on it the first two days, and I know what I'm doing with it, I just need to finish writing lol.  It's taken a turn I hadn't expected at the start, but I'm happy with it.  It's shown I have talents for writing other than depressed poems. However, I might have to edit the story in order for some friends to like it.
