I can't believe that my vacation is almost here! I've been waiting all summer for this, and I really think it's going tobe AWESOME! I've never been to Panama City before, but I LOVE Florida.   Well, I guess I should update you on the happenings in my life. Don't start yawning yet - I've been pretty busy lately, andI LOVE being busy!Last weekend on Saturday, I went to Chili's and to see  The Terminal  with Casey,and for all of you who haven't seen that movie yet - go see it! On Sunday I went to the movies again with my friend Megan, and we saw  King Arthur  - not the type of movie that you would picture me wanting to see - but I really did like it. LOL We got a lil' confused at some points, but since we were like the only people in the theater we kinda helped each other figure out what was going on. On Tuesday I celebrated my best friend Cindy's birthday by going to the Mall of GA. HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIRL! I LUV YA! We had a lot of fun hanging out - that was like the first time that I've gotten to see her this summer!Then, on Wed. I went to the outlet mall with my friend Bekah who is the ultimate boy hunter - I swear, the girl has like a hot guy radar or something! hahaha And that pretty much sums up my week. Now, I'm just sitting here blogging, and then I've gotta go finish packing!    Note to my friends:   You guyz really need to get blogs so that I can link you!!!    GUESS WHAT?  hahaha I know that so many people hate it when you say 'guess what?' I've had plenty of debates about that, but trust me, if I say it, I'm gonna tell you whatever I have to say right after so, don't worry - I won't really make you guess - well, unless you want to or something. I got a call yesterday from  JcPenny , and they want me to come in for an interview next Friday at two o'clock! Yay! For those of you who don't know, I have applied at 12 different places this summer, and no one has called me back until now. I'm really hoping to get the job, but I'm a little scared that I'm going to say or do something stupid atthe interview. Be praying for me!   Do you ever wonder where you are meant to live? I mean, you might know where you WANT to live, but what about the place that is exactly right for you? Check out this  urlLink web site Ispotted - I found it to be pretty interesting.   Today we decided to go and check out this new store that just opened here called  Ross . Well, when we were riding down the road this lil' light came on in the car, and I looked it up in the Toyota book and it said that you should go to your dealer's. My grams had just gone to get the car checked three days ago so that we wouldn't have any problems while on vacation. Well, we had to wait there for like 45 minutes, and finally, they told us that something was loose and it had probably happened the other day. I was about to get mad if something was REALLY wrong, because man, no one is getting in the wayof me and my long awaited vacation! LOL But there was this cute guy who worked there! (Bekah, I really am hanging out with you too much! hahaha) And theproblem was fixed and for free too,so ... vacation ... here I come!   For those of you who are shopaholics out there, you really need to check out Ross and TJ Max. I'm a real bargin shopper - one day I could totally write an amazing fashion section for a magazine - and no matter what your style is, you can find something at either of these stores. And guess what??? THEY'RE CHEAP! Most shirts cost $5 and jeans only cost up to like $15! They also have things from really expensive stores! I saw a shirt there that I must have paid like $20 for, and it was only like 5 bucks!!! Grrrrr ... Anyway, God has answered my prayers - he has given me new stores with great bargins. THANKS GOD!   Well, that's about it ... by this time tomorrow (well, maybe by this time)I will be in beautifulFlorida! hehehe I can't wait! I'll be back onThursday for those of you who need to know, (I told you that everyoneshould have a web site so that we can figure out where people have run off to!)and I'm sure that I'll miss all of you guys while I'm gone. But this girl really needs to have a little fun before school starts back - trust me, I REALLY need it!   So guys, don't forget to relax a little before the summer's over. Sure, teenage years can be stressful no matter what time of the year it is, but you can't forget to just have some full blown out fun every now and then! Partay! LOL I'm such a dork ...  I'll blog all about my vacation probably Friday, and I'll even post some pictures! Until then my friends ... JKM - OUT!
