Finally I remembered that I needed a coffee mug, indispensable to keep awake in my morning classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. My teacher has one, he's my role model at the moment, I must have one.   I didn't like any of the ones they had at Target except for a rather primitive looking one, it wasn't cool enough, it wasn't original enough, it wasn't ME enough.   In the mean time I looked at the toys and invariable as it always is, I ended up being royally humiliated, I tried to Hoola Hoop ...  I shouldn't have.   Anyway, after that I decided to conquer the mug issue, I ended up going to Barnes And Noble where I found the perfect/dream mug, but indecisive as I am I went to borders where I bought a pretty red mug for my boyfriend, then i took the trip back to barnes and noble where i obtained the fair 18oz copper chubby mug that is now my new baby.
