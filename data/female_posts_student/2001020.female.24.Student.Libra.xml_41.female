When I start to read, I think about everything else I could probably be doing...not so good at all. I think I'm going to be completely frivolous and list my law school potential boy exploits and really get away from my computer.  Boys to Chase (hahahaha, I'm so high school again!): Chris (but it would never work out!) Erik (yes, you look GREAT in a suit!) John (but he's the unchasable) Ed (had him once, I'd probably have him again, he's fun) Matt (but he's someone else's, so I'll wait it out) Mike (was that purple bandana for me?) Kris (I could learn to like Abercrombie) Graeme (no, not the cracker, the Italian stallion, ha!)  That must be it. Not the comprehensive list I thought it would be. Look at all those American boy names! The ethnic boys at this school are soooo lacking! I'm going back to my roots and dating Caucasian boys again...what an adventure! Actually, some of those boys are ethnic, their names just don't show it. Okay, enough enough ENOUGH procrastinating. I'm gonna read some tonight and do my best to get up in the morning to finish...or maybe I should just finish them all tonight, knowing me and my waking up early habits (nonexistant!). Anyways, bye bye, adios, sayonara, see ya later!
