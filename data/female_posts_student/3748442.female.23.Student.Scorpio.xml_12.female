Together we will turn my living room into a Purple Paradise. I have already started painting, and after 6 hours of non-stop rolling, taping, and inhaling carcinogenic fumes, I can't even say I'm halfway done.   Today I am going to go look for purple fabric in order to make drapery for the windows. I have this vision of myself doing yoga on the blue yoga mat (that I have yet to buy) to the yoga DVD (that I have yet to buy) while a cool breeze blows through the sheer, purple-colored silk, making sunlight and shadows flicker and dance along the freshly painted walls, and thus my yoga experience will be the most spiritual and mentally satisfying to date. Since we decided on the drapery color, that ultra-feminine, purple-loving, girly-girl inside has been daydreaming of what's to come.   In other news, the rugrat won't stop barfing. There's nothing like having a two year with a stomach bug in the house. Toddlers have NO aim which means barf goes everywhere: rug, pillows, my hair, the bottom right crisper drawer in the refrigerator. They are just like little barf bombs, ticking to go off at any second. Last time she was sick, it took us seven loads of laundry and three bottles of Bac-Out to recover.   Redecorating and Barf. I hope you all enjoyed this little glimpse into my fabulous life.
