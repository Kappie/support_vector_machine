Not so much the writing in laws, but the actual interaction between the two people. Dating seems like its a go to thing.  You don't live with the person and to be together you have to "go see" eachother.  Marriage like relationships are a go from thing.  You spend all this time with a person and the only time you are away from the person is when you phisycally "go from" that person, such as work or go hang out with same sex night (girls/boys night).  And I told him we have a dating relationship, we call eachother and have to go to eachother.  But during the school year we have more of a marriage relationship, not married, but only in eyes of law.  It's not fair to place so much emphasis on legal bindings when it really is only a religious thing that only some people can partake in.  And then there are those that are married who are not really married, it's more like dating with the law on their side. And that is my analysis.  Luckily Ross and I can adapt easily to both so this school, summer thing doesn't suck.  It is a little more lonley but i figure it's only temprary.  Personal:  So roommate problems.  It's only been a few weeks and they are pissing me off, well only the two actually.  I don't care if they party or anything, but they are anti-social and rude all the time.  So last night they have their sisters over and they are drinking late, and I was up, that was not the problem... The problem was that they were drinking and being loud, and drinking is prohibitted, but so if security comes we are fucked.  And if we leave the shit out, we get in trouble, which guess what they never cleaned up.  Turns out one went to the hospital, but well this is nothing new this not cleaning up.  It's just very inconsiderate, but I have only one more week... so I don't care. I only hate feeling like shit the last week of summer classes.  I got drugs and chilis so hopefully tomorrow won't suck as bad.  It just stinks not being "with it" at work and class.  But I get to see Ross soon and I will be so happy, oh yeah and I better feel better in time for the wedding or else it will not be so fun.
