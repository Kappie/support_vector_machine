During the morning hours we went with our dad to help clean the apartments that my parents rent out to college kids every year, so it's presentable for human habitation again. It wasn't all that bad, I guess. We spent three to four hours running up and down flights of stairs and fetching things to either fix or clean broken and/or dirty miscellaneous objects throughout the three story apartment building... That place is so spooky and not to mention humungous... Last time that I went there to help my parents out, I got lost in there... Ah, it was positvely horrible. It was SO creepy. You couldn't hear anything at all. The walls were as thick as tar, I swear. It was very spooky. I was screaming for my sister who, though I did not know it at the time, was directly a floor below me. She didn't hear my shouting at all... Weird, huh?  I'm veering off topic here... Anyways, Cole and I, got back from the apartments around 12ish. We didn't really hang out until 4:30 or so... We talked for a half an hour and then decided to take a walk to the high school that we're going to be attending after this year... Oh my gosh, we had an awesome time! We talked about everything and anything that entered our minds... It was hilarious... We bumped into my brother's old friend, who just happens to be extremely attractive, while we were walking. It was funny.   We eventually walked back home, pigged out on Chinese food, and then set off to buy our favorite ice cream at our local Stewarts. Our favorite ice cream of all time of course, is chocolate chip cookie dough! Yum, it's delicious... If you haven't ever had it before, I highly recommend that you try it... Anyhow, we ate our ice cream and talked about silly things until we reached one of our city's parks. Then we went around screaming idiotic things like "marshmallow" and "teletubbies." We're freaks, aren't we? It was awesome. Tonight we're supposed to go see I, Robot... I don't know if we're going to be able to go though... My parents are a little cranky and tired after a days work at "the apartments."  Nicole's my best friend... Yeah, we happen to be blood related but does that matter? Some people won't become friends with us, at the times when I'm outgoing of course, just because Nicole and I are close. I find that extremely odd AND stupid. I mean, if Nicole and I weren't from the same blood line, those people would have no problem with being our friends at all... It's ridiculous, totally... I hate it when people won't be my friend just because I have a twin. I feel so discrimminated against... Well, not really, but you know what I mean, right? No? Okay, nevermind...  In soccer last year my coach forced the twins on the team to pair up with someone else. That's totally not fair. I mean, all the other best friends get to pair up with one another, just because we're blood related doesn't make the situation any different really! Ugh, some people just really make me mad. I seriously don't understand people when they do this... It makes me really, really angry... I wish people weren't so cruel... Someone told me to go have sex with Nicole once, just because we were twins... What the hell is wrong with people?  Ugh, some people just really annoy the hell out of me...  And now I'm gone...
