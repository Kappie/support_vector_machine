So the keyboard is chosen. Now, shall I rant or shall I make everyone laugh simply by not ranting and talking about something else entirely to put me in a good mood? RANT  Ok so I was at work today. I work at this cute little tea house downtown, which is just a fancy word for "don't blink or you'll miss it" Colorado. So anyway. It's called Past and Repast Memories and is so cute, being placed in an old house with the original flooring. It's yellow and white and when you walk in it smells like tea and quiche. (People come from Boulder, four hours away, to eat Peggy's quiche.) So I walked in and there are already people sitting down, and it's only 10:30. I go into the dish room and start putting up air-dryed dishes from Sunday or Monday (I can't remember what day they were last open) and talking to the cook. Well then I had a group of fifteen walk in and I got 9 of them to take care of. Well the group of four didn't walk in until after the rest of their group was seated and then they threw a fit because even though they didn't have a reservation they wanted us to make it so they could all sit together. The tea house ain't that big people. So we eventually worked it out and they left good tips but *sighs* anyway.  Now I'm mindlessly being irritating to my friends on the internet. Or I should say "friend." See, there's only one person on and so I don't have much choice of whom to annoy. Well I'm out of anything to say, which is odd, but I'll be going now.
