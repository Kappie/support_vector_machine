My fingers anre nervously tapping the keyboard and it's turning into words. So I decided to come here. Not that it will do my any good. PROCASTINATION!!! Yes, that moca-latte I had this morning was missing chocolate, but it most certainly wasn't missing it's caffine. Only my body is feeling it though, not my mind. My eyelids are still hung at half mast from staying up till 1:30 reading a new comic I was loaned the other day. Making sure my cell phone was indeed on so I wouldn't miss any calls. Even at that time of night. There was always hope. To no avail. No matter. "so he would sulk and drink and mope and cross his arms and hope to die..." TELL ME WHAT TO DO! I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE! I've lost all the tears I'm going to this weekend. I'm at a loss as to what to do next.  SCIENCE PAPER HO!   caffine rocks my squeeky slippers off......
