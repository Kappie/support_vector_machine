Well that's an interesting thing to say I'm broke. But you're right I DO have insufficient funds. In fact I was just about to call YOU' 'No, sir, you don't understand we're going to have to penalize you fifteen dollars' So now I have 5 dollars in the bank. They take from the guy who only has twenty bucks. But ya know what happens when you have a lot of money THEY PAY YOU MORE. So then I have even less money in the bank so they take fifteen dollars again. So now I have negative ten dollars. I don't even have no money. Negative ten dollars. That means I can't afford something that costs nothing."
