I just got through watching Monster with my mother. She had never seen it and I told it was part of our Prostitution Sundays ritual.  We seem to watch some of the weirdest movies on Sundays - I don't know how it happens. We had a good laugh about it though.   I had a great weekend in Austin. Jen and I hung out on Thursday night and went tooling around downtown.  Saturday was fun -  we saw Napoleon Dynamite!  It comes out nationally this week I think - you have to see it. It was hysterical. Thank goodness, I have my, "My lips hurt real bad!" Chapstick. Hahahahaha. Oh, you had to be there. Check out the official website - it's down righ tnow but hopefully it will be up and running soon. http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/napoleondynamite/fanclub/index.php  Kid on Bus: What are you gonna do today, Napoleon?  Napoleon Dynamite: Whatever I feel like I wanna do, gosh!   I wish I could insert sound here.  Oh man, Lisa and I must have laughed about this for 4 hours - actually we all did, Jen included.  Thanks for lunch on Friday, Paddy. It was yummy.
