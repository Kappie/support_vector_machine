Not quite the same but it helps.  AND ANOTHER WOOT...strangely enough, video games and girls...such an odd combination. You girls sound like my mother when it comes to vids, heheh. I used to be the biggest Mario head ever, until Nintendo started sucking and making kids' games...MARIO IS NOT A GAME FOR CHILDREN, there's horrible, grisly death and obscenities in Mario if you look hard enough. It's like playing a The Who record backwards and hearing a demonic subliminal message.  Mario Kart is God's reward to kids for not screwing him over so much as everyone else. We were talking about  a  computer game (CounterStrike woot, or CS woot, as it is called (mostly by me)), but whatever.  GROSS as to the Coke.  GROSS ! But I've already shared my view on this (a three second UGH), but just so you all know...Abby's mother should NOT be an example as to how to drink a Coke. As a matter of fact, I'm going to demonstrate the proper technique on imbibing such drinks on my online cookbook, which is going to be out soon...it's not published yet, so don't even try. But it WILL be, kids!
