Ugh...I woke up with a migraine, I could definetly tell when we would go through trees and the sunlight would shine back at us again when we entered a clear spot. It was horrible...flash flash flash, like someone repeatedly hitting me in the head with a hammer. Oh well, I took some medication, should be gone in a while. I'm incredibly bored though, those who I'd like to talk to are all in bed at this hour and conversations with myself are getting old. It's Friday, another weekend where I'll search for something ridiculous to do to pass away the hours. I think I might go with Rachel and Gabel tomorrow to get Gabel's tattoo, not sure...something more interesting might come up. Hopefully I'll get to see Ty sometime; hopefully. It all depends I suppose. Well, this was quite long for my first post...I still have a lot to figure out about this whole blog thing so it's going to be under construction for a while. Haha, that sounds silly...WARNING: Website under construction. lol ok,I'm going for now, might post tonight. Bye!
