After class I was going to go see my grandmother and mother but when I called my mother said that granny was asleep and she was about to watch her novela.  (i.e. you can come over, but nobody is going to talk to you.)  WELL EXCUUUUUSE MEE!   So I went straight home.    Got home at 8:45.  Drove slow because the weather was so icky out.  (Couldnt drive my normal 75 mph on the highway home, grumble, grumble...)  I HATE driving in the rain and snow, and, lemme tell ya, if I was ABLE to skip class, I would, but this woman is relentless!!  a) I had to hand in the compositions from hell, b) she goes on and on about us needing to be there and c) she'll go through, like, at least one chapter a class,  in spanish , at top speed, so if I'm not there, there's no WAY I'm going to pass the quizzes/tests.  So, yeah, it sucks.  Saw American Idol last night on tape, but it wasnt too late to call in for my favorites.  Actually, here's a hint...EVERYONE calls right after the show is over, but the lines are open for TWO HOURS.  So I usually call after 24 is over and then I can actually get through.  ha-HA!  This time, 24 wasnt on, but like I said, I was watching it on tape.  Because LaToya was in the bottom 3 one week, I give the obligatory vote for her.  Even when she's 'eh', she's amazing.  And she's adorable, so that doesnt hurt.  I also voted for Fantasia even though the whole world is voting for her, mainly because she made me cry because she 'felt her song' and hell, she was SOOO GOOD.  Then I voted for Jennifer Hudson because I dont think people like her as much as they should...and lastly I voted for George because even though the song wasnt a great choice, he's just so sweet I couldnt NOT vote for him.  Sorry JPL, but you forgot the words to a classic, you looked extremely stiff up there, and even though everyone but Simon thought you were great because you were 'geeky, nerdy, being yourself' that doesnt work for me.  It works for me with Clay Aiken.  Amazing voice, geeky look.  GO AWAY JPL.
