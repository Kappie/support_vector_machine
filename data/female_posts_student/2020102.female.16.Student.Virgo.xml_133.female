Alex: I didn't think anyone would be on time leadership-wise and I was RIGHT!  "Texas is so flat, you can watch your dog run away for two weeks."  -Keith Davis, Red Ribbon Week speaker  (Talking about I-Searches and overachievers) Ryan Spalding: You think you've got it bad, I have to go today, after that Kyrsten girl. That girl is like a (deleted) genius. Brandon: Only because she doesn't have anything better to do.  (Grading each other's papers in English) Ryan S.: Cursive is really hard to read. Micaela: Sorry, I have bad handwriting. Ryan S.: No, I just can't read it very well. Brandon: Yeah, it's even harder when you're trying to cheat on her on a stupid vocab quiz.  "I HATE that Rachelle girl. She's like this awful incarnation of eveil. I hope she gets struck down. Or RUN OVER, one of the two. She won't be so happy when she's BOUNCING OFF THE HOOD OF MY CAR."  -Ryan S. when he was having a bad day and this cheerleader was acting like a third grader and throwing pennies at him for no reason  "Life is too short to keep your opinion to yourself." -Ryan S.  Ryan S.: Are you gonna glare at me every time you see me now? Rachelle: I wasn't glaring at you, I was giving you a dirty look.  Ryan S.: Oh, well that's better.
