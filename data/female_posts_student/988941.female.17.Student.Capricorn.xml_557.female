It's like a normal flash, but it flashes different colours, making the subjects in your photos come out in beautiful ab-normal colours. Cosmic stuff. I also bought a pretty cosmic hippy top to add to my new look. Deep red, with black and white patterns. I've got all my Austria photos etc back! This photo below is taken outside the Tate Modern. Read the bin.   I'll look though the others and post a few goodies later.
