And yes, a seven nation army can't hold me back. I can't forget. Don't want to hear about it. Every single ones got a story to tell. From the queen of England to the hounds of hell. And that ain't what you want to hear but that's what I'll do. You know I'm having fun...  Well, let's see. Something interesting to talk about for today.  Here's a typical Phileda day!   6:00 - Wake up. Take a shower using 'John Freida Beach Blonde' :).  7:00 - Run out of time but still don't know what to wear. Close eyes and pick something.  7:20 - Leave for band.  7:35 - Why did I bother getting to band so early? The warmup was played by like... 5 people? lol. It wuz fun.  English - I just realised, like now, at 7:30PM lol that I don't have my English homework. Oh well.  World Geography - What are factions? Who the h*** knows what a faction of Cyprus is?   Spanish - I really don't want to know how I did on that test. It can't have been all too hot.  Lunch - It was cold.   IPC - My favorite class!   Geometry - God. Could we do more work, possibly? I guess we could, yah.  Health - My favorite teacher lol.   Well, after that I had tennis practice. That was fun. I was hitting really well, I think. Although this was the let down part: Coach Warlick: "Phileda how could you hit shots like that and not even win a point at the tournament?" Phileda: "I don't know!!!!" CW: "I was counting on you." Phileda: "I don't know!!!!"  I know what you're thinking. Sad, huh. Yah it burned.   OK, I know that was kind of boring. lol.  Here's the "highlights" of the day.  1) Courtney, where WERE you? 2) I can't believe I dropped that note in the hallway and Mark picked it up, READ it! AHHHHHH. 3) I still didn't get my gym bag back from wherever I lost it. lol.  I am going to come up with topics to write about in future so it's more interesting. Any ideas?  LOVE YOU ALL, no matter who you are!
