I was absent today. I caught a fever. That is the reason why I was absent. I stayed at home and take a good rest for a faster recovery. Haha.. In fact, I’ve an enjoyable time at home.  I watched the Band competition VCD that was distributed yesterday. Lastly, I knew how was the performance being carried out on that night by my own eyes. Since the competition, I just listen to others’ comments, now I can make the judgement myself. It wasn’t that terrible like what I think. It’s ok. However, many mistakes occurred when the formation was performed. The mistakes weren’t any minor mistakes that other people might not notice about, but they were the mistakes could be easily seen even though they were not professional.  I was very happy as I was off today. I haven’t done my Add Maths homework. I scared my teacher will scold me again ler.. Furthermore, I don’t feel like going to school too. Let’s see today’s timetable:  7:30am – 8:35am : Add Maths  8:35am – 9:45am : English  9:45am – 10:20am : EST  10:20am – 10:45am : Recess  10:45am – 11:55am : Chemistry  11:55am – 1:10pm : Chinese  Err… It wasn’t that fine to have all these subjects together in a day. =-(   When I wasn’t around in school today, will my classmate miss me? I hope they will. I think my seatmate will miss me a lot, I was told that she’ll feel very lonely if nobody is sitting beside her. It doesn’t mean that my presence carry great importance to her. Hehe.. And I know I’m not an important role in my class. Anyway, I’m happy with who I am. I know I might be important to somebody. =) like....... my parents
