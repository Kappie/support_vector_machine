But He's Irresistible (Irresistible) Up close and personal Now inesacpable I can hardly breathe ( I can hardly breathe) More than just physical  Deeper than spritual (oh oh yeah) His ways are powerful Irresistible to me  Can't You see whenever he's close to me I really find it hard to breathe He's so irresistible Baby you know its more than just spritual His kisses are powerful  He's so irresistible (yeah yeah) Up close and personal (oh yeah) Now inescapable I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breath) More than just physical (oh yeah) Deeper than Spiritual  His ways are powerful  Irresistible to me  He's irresistible (yeah yeah) Up close and personal (irresistible to me) I can hardly breathe More than just physical  Deeper than spritual His ways are powerful Irresistible to me....  jessica simpson - "irresistible"    and theres no connection between the two..
