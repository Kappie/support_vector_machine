Like at first things went kinda slow, but then everyone split from each other, I went somewhere with Patrick, and then Candace, Jackie, and Callie went somewhere else, later on I find out they were trying to find us.. but anyway, back to Patrick. We went into a lot of different stores, held hands, you know.. that kinda stuff. Then we walked to someplace.. I don't even know where, andwe kissed, then we walked back to everyone else. I met, er.. Katy? Patrick's like old lover or something, I dunno what she was, but I met her. She said she just wanted to meet Patrick's girlfriend, and I have no idea when I became that, I don't remember these simple words, "Wanna go out with me?" Never, never do I remember hearing, or reading them. But if I'm his girlfriend then like, what happened between me and Jake, and Candace and Jake, and Madison and Jake is kinda.. BLEH!          Hahaha, only funny thing at Utica Square though was that, a couple of us had to kiss another girl >.    Anyway, I had Jackie over to spend the night, we swam and I figured out how long I can hold my breath. 1 minute, 30 seconds.. Yeah, that's right, I can hold my breath for that long. Haha, but that's really all that I have to tell.. I'll chat ya up later!
