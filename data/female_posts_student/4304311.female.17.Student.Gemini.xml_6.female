It was apparently changed because American kids are too stupid to comprehend what a philosopher is.  Below is a list of further retitling of the Harry Potter series:   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  will become  Harry Potter and the Teacher's Rock   Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  will become  Harry Potter and the Room He Couldn't Find...Until Later   Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban  will become  Harry Potter and the Guy in Jail   Harry Potter and the Goblet  will become  Harry Potter and the Hot Cup   Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  will become  Harry Potter and the Bird Group              By the way, if you haven't figured out that this is a joke, then it amazes me you managed to find this site.
