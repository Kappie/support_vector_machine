I know you guys are so tired of my whining about things, but I am seriously just scared about Ed going out there, especially where he is going to be. That truly scares me. Sleeper cells, huh? I just hope that Ed stays out of harms way. Damn, and I thought that by marrying a sailor he would just be on a boat....I guess being a corpsman changes everything. I wish so much he were on a boat instead of going out with the Marines...but I have so much more respect for corpsmans attached with the marines because by all means they are just as much marines...they have to train and work as hard as any other marine.      urlLink Sleeper cells     Anyway, I should slow down on reading any news on Iraq. I know that it is just going to bring up my anxiety level. We all know that only the bad things get covered out there and I really need to stay away from all the bad stuff. A lot of Ed's close friends are getting shipped out there. I am just glad I will have other people to talk to who are in the same boat. I thought last year would be the end of all this worrying. I guess I was wrong. Oh well.
