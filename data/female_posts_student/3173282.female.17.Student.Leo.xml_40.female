Then we went to sunset park and saw the whole world. There were fireworks there and all, then we all went to amanda sweet's house to sit in lawn chairs. Haha, theeeen i went over to shannon's and had some good times. 2 people trying to talk online to different people doesn't work so well. The other one always ends up saying something you would never say yourself, therefore confusing the person on the other end and making them wonder why they are friends with you! SOOO not necessary! Hmm, yesterday me, Rachel, Amanda, Kate, and Zack went to jim and nena's but i didnt eat there. Then the 3 cool ones left and me and rachel went to wendy's cuz its better. Then we got together with Karin, Kelsi, Sweet, and Kat and just drove around. Hmm hmm....today we went to breakfast at Denny's for sweet's birthday. By "we" i mean the whole world again. We got the back room yesss! Well now i really can't spend any more money! I leave for new hampshire for flying camp on Sunday, instead of Monday. Noo good. My time left in york is getting less and less and soon it will be over. There's so much time  i haven't been able to spend with certain people and it makes me really sad and depressed. I'm not a huge fan of the pot fanatics these days. Let's not forget what's really important in life, goodnight.
