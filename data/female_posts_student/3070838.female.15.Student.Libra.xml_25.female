So then we killed about 4 hours at Andrew's house. We drove around, walked around, I tried to ride his bike in a skirt (haha), played poker (or tried), played spit (and lost to Travis), and then we played BS (btw, Andrew isn't very good jk lol). So after watching Andrew blow up 2 peanut cans with a gun we went to the movies.  Well, none of us are 17, I'm the oldest, I'm 15 lol. We wanted to see Dawn of the Dead. So I tried to pretend I was 17. Unfortunately, that didn't work. So then we got tickets to see Walking Tall. We got there, and I really didn't want to see it so then Andrew asked the front desk if we could switch to Scooby Doo 2.... (sad... we know) So we went to Scooby Doo 2, and we were the only ones laughing. I swear we enjoyed it more than these little kids lol. Of course, if we'd been smart at the beginning we would have bought tickets to Hellboy, which was right next to DotD and then gone into that one. But no... We just couldn't think that fast.  Oh well, Luv u all lotz n lotz, ~*Phileda*~
