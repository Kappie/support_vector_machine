Some one typed some thing about giving out chocolate bunnies and i said wow dark or white chocolate and some one called me wierd. I do mind I guess cause they don't know me and they sounded like they were saying it meanly. It is really mean to judge some one before you know them or any thing about them, and it just makes me really angry when people do. Hmm, is it me or is there no such thing as perfect health? I'm always ill! I mean like uhh kind of ow my leg then ow my ear type thingy. Yeah, I need to talk to some one! I'm getting too angry! That's why the quiet one's are evil, they never share there feelings and some times they don't know how to (might sound wierd but some people do find it hard!) so they blow. Yeah, I'll run back to my hole now.
