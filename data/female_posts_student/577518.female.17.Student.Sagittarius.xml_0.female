We need to study by ourselves, teachers are there just to guide us, not command us to do homeworks or revisions. Everything is like a dream, I never expect I can be this far, I thought I will never grow up to achieve anything I dream. It takes 2 years to step in to the university. It takes extra efforts to make a goal, I told myself, I need to be patient, I must work hard and enjoy my form 6. Just call me  kiasu  or anything, I don't care, my goal is 'enter the U'. To those who always look down at and think I'm a loser, I don't care, you go your own way.   Teo get the JPA scholarship, he went to UTM on Tuesday. I will miss him very much! Lee  went to MMU few weeks ago, having fun with his university life earlier than anyone of us and meanwhile try to woo a cute girl in his class. I have no idea how to help him, just hope that this couple will live happily ever after ;)
