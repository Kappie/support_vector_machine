There's nothing except  artifical strawberry in my mouth and my brain is cotton candy and with it flowing out of my ears it's blocking  inspiration and my heart is rock candy crystalized and not pumping emotion        Life's blood Pumping soda      Sugary          Fizzy              Empty and with the syrup flowing  out the tip of my pen       I'm sticking to the page and i can't write anything              But              Sugar
