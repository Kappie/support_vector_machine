After that I hung out for a while with Marrah and Bill and then we took our Global Studies Final too. I failed that one I think..I did extremely bad. I think I did okay on the english one though. After that we took bill home and then I came home. An hour or so later I went to A and Long John Silvers. Me and my mom are getting along good now thankfully. :) I dont know what Im doing tomorrow..Probably doing something with Bill but who the hell knows. Wednesday night if my daddy will go pick up Cierra she's coming here until Friday afternoon. Grr...Im going to go now, I think that Ill probably write later.
