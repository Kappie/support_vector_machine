A couple months ago Jeff and I decided it was time to try and move out of here (here being my grandpa's house) and find a place to call our own. You see, about 2 years ago I moved back here b/c my grandpa said that he was going to get an apartment in Daytona, since that's where he works, that way he wouldn't have to drive as far. He would only come back to the house every Wednesday to do laundry and check up on things (i.e. bitch about the yard not being mowed or the gutters needing cleaning, etc.). He told me that if I could find someone to live with me and rent out one of the bedrooms, then we could have the house to ourselves. So I asked my friend Amy if she would like to live with me since she was living in a situation that wasn't good for her at the time. She said yes and moved in. We got settled in here, adopted a dog (Tank), and everything was cool. Next thing I know, my sister (who was going to Jacksonville University at the time) decided that she wasn't happy at JU and wanted to move back home. So Erin packed her stuff up and moved back home with me and Amy. Erin then decided she wanted a dog since Amy and I had one. She then adopted her dog, Diesel. Couple months go by and Jeff and I started to date and it turned into a serious relationship, so eventually he moved in with me. Amy and him didn't get along very well b/c she had a crush on him and was jealous of our relationship and he got annoyed with her all the time. Things got bad, Amy moved out, and things we're ok again. Time goes by and Dad calls. He lost his job in Tennessee and him and his girlfriend we're no longer doing well together. He then wants to know if we would mind if he moved in with us "temporarily" until he found a job down here and was able to get on his feet again. Erin and I said sure and he moved in with us this past January. Took him about 2 months to find a job but he finally got one. He agreed when he moved down here that he would pay Gramps 100 a month for rent and I don't think Gramps has seen a dime. He was only supposed to be here for about a month or two. It's been 5. We have a no smoking rule in the house which he seems to think doesn't apply to him b/c he sits in his bedroom and smoke about a pack a day and uses empty cans for his ash tray. I guess he thinks we can't smell or something. I hate cigarettes. I'm about to put a sign on his door that says No Smoking. He can march his happy ass outside like everyone else. He's also a slob, doesn't help out around the house, and comes home drunk all the time. I told him I don't like him when he's drunk so he tries to hide that too. Disgusting. So anyways, this is where we're at today. I have to get out of this house. My mom seems to think she might be moving back down here too so of course she would come here. I'm just ready to be out on my own and not have to put up with everyone's drama. If all goes well we will be in our own house by the end of June! YAY!
