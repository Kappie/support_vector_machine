I have quite a few of my poems posted over there- and there are some really good writers to bounce your ideas off of if you want to check it out here is the site http://www.pw.org --- go to the Speakeasy, you have to register, but its well worth it.  12/27/99 "To Add to My Sleepless Rest"  Lately I've had to think myself to sleep, And I wonder if it will ever stop- This painful beating of my heart; But my problems far outweigh my happy days, And the more I think about them, The more my heart starts to numb, And I can't feel anymore happiness; No more pain, no more anything, Since everyone I love has done something wrong.  Lately I haven't been able to think, Things have confused me to the point of pain, And what can I really consider to be truth, Since no one ever has any for me; My best friend started our whole existence- Upon a lie I can't rely on, And everyone that I've ever known, Has had a lie in their thoughts- In their heart is a bitter cruelty I cannot live with, And every person I've ever trusted, Turned their backs on me when they voiced those hated lies.  My best friend doesn't love me; He doesn't care what I do or who I am, Only that I'll be there when he's lonely And there's no one else to rely on, I know now that I can't trust him, And that he has no respect for my love, This is just another one of the problems That numbs me while I hope for sleep, And the rest that is clouded with dreams to follow The emptieness caused by unwanted love.  8/3/2001 "A Piece for the Corner" Tonight of all nights I haven't Been able to sleep as much As I have the past few months I've been without your touch Everyday the weight's been lighter But the pain is still the same It's a shame that I cant go a day Without speaking or thinking your name So many things remind me of you I don't know how I Get through each day in once piece The hurt makes me wanna cry But I knew that with my silence I was pushing you farther away But only in my silence Would you choose to stay So tonight I haven't been able to sleep  I know now why I don't TEll you the feelings I'm feeling  expect you to care 'cause you wont.
