No. No, you can't...  STOP.  Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave... if you leave... I just, I remember things better with you. I do, look. P. Sherman, forty-two... forty-two... I remember it, I do.  It's there, I know it is, because when I look at you, I can feel it. And-and I look at you, and I... and I'm home.   Please... I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget.     i understand that your worst is beating the hell out of my best but i can take it, i can take it.  -- forever and always --        Christine...
