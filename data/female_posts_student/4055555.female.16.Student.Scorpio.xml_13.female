I ended up getting The Sims Superstar expansion pack lol (don't moan at me... and don't underestimate The Sims!). John bought me the The Sims Unleashed expansion pack a while ago and I love it! He got me hooked lol. I can't wait for Sims 2! Then after town I went to Johns and chilled out and stuff.      Today I packed my suitcase for my holiday! I'm going to Teneriffe on friday, so my mum forced me to pack early because I always seem to forget something if I pack in a rush lol. I'm excited about it but I'll really miss John! It's only two weeks I suppose, not like it's a month... aw well :(   Then I went to John's. He formatted his PC while I watched TV and then we both watched good old CSI.      My mum picked me up around 10ish and took me to Tescos to get some last minute bits for our hols. I seen Jay and said a quick hello. When my mum and I where on our way out the security things started beeping. Jay heard and must of thought we were shop lifting! Deary me! Luckily though it was just the women on the cashtill (who was very nice may I add... my mum was having a good natter with her) had forgotten to take a security tag off a skirt I had bought. Oopsy! After all the embarrasment we went home and watched Big Brother that my dad had taped for us to watch (my parents are obbsessed as well as I am!) Then it was a game on The Sims and now here I am!      Right that's all for tonight... bedtime for me!    Nighty night xxx
