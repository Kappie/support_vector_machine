(i love how i say that about lots of my fun nights... but this time, i mean it!)  so it was lana banana's birthday... and delenda played! it was SO sweet. they played in her garage, and everyone was packed in there... we were standing like right next to the band members... and wow. it was amazing. they played some of their songs, but then they played  war all the time  by thursday,  you're so last summer  by taking back sunday,  187  and  bloody romance  by senses fail... they were all amazing! it was so good. [awesome job, guys! you rocked.]  so after delenda played, we ate pizza, had cake, and watched happy gilmore. it was so sweet... then lana gave the girls some pictures that she had taken at school. (i must admit, there were some pretty good ones of me! sweet.)  "anson, i love you!"-erin, like 27947 times tonight. most of which were while they were playing.  "goosefraba"-erin to evan. (he has anger problems.) "goose problems!?"-vanessa.  "evan, you have major anger problems..."-me *5 minutes later.* "calm down."-evan "don't tell me to f-cking calm down."-mark "aha and you say  i  have anger problems!"-evan.   confusion bleeds to vulture stares- conviction bleeds the silence here. says:  you will never guess who else was thurr.  and the value of destiny comes to nothing. says:  mmm..your right i wont! give me a clue.  confusion bleeds to vulture stares- conviction bleeds the silence here. says:  starts with "r" and ends with "ob".  and the value of destiny comes to nothing. says:  oh wow.  bad clue kate! i didnt even have to guess...it was rlkjlkjlkjlkjkob wasnt it?  "anson has swedish hair."-evan  aaah and while they were playing a song, mike dropped his pic... and me, being the awesome person i am, picked it up for him. (wow i touched a band member of delenda's guitar pic. wow. never washing my hand again...btw, i'm joking.)  so there were lots of people thurr tonight: lana. (obviously) sofija. erin. vanessa. emily. evan. mike. ray. mark. anson. marina. person i don't know #1. person i don't know #2.  it was coo. one of lana's friends that i don't know was all like ghetto...and he spoke spanish (as well as yugoslavian... cuz lana's yugoslavian) and he was speaking to erin in spanish... and she was laughing so hard. it was sweet.  ack there are quotes that i can't remember... cuz it was such a cool night.  but it's 20 to 1, so i'm gonna go now. paice.  i stay wrecked and jelous for this- for this simple reason.  kayte.
