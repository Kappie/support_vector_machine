We always see shooting stars, and we always make secret wishes. Last time, we even saw a satellite. When we lie there we immediately go through the most important stuff in our lives right now, with a special kind of honesty which is hard to bring about in daylight. Two nights ago, me, Ellen and My was lying there watching stars and talking about boys. Gee, I'm really starting to sound like some na√Øve 14-year old back in the good old 50's, but that's about as far as I go when it comes to guys. Sadly. We were discussing that to; the strange fact that I'm never the one to have a boyfriend or even date/flirt with one. I suppose I ought to work that charm...  ~:~  My just called to say she misses me. She was so drunk I got jealous. She's away at a really good music festival I couldn't afford going to. Bad. Today I spent the day with an old friend and her old friends, bathing and playing boule. A bit nerdy but it was relaxed and fun.  ~:~  I'm starting to wonder what I should do in order to make more people to read my blog? At least I feel like nobody's reading it since I never get any comments... Am I doing something wrong, or is it just that my life is too boring? Anyway, if you're reading this please post a comment so I know cyber-space isn't entirely empty.
