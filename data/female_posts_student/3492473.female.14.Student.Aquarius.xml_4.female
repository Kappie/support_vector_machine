The last time I hung out w/ any of my friends (and soccer does not count) was Saturday at the festival. If that really even counts as hanging out. They ditched me pretty much the whole night. Even at soccer, I feel like a loser. And soccer is suppose to be one of my "escapes." I mean obviously I know my friends do things and hang out w/ other people. So when they  surprisingly  call me, it's stupid of them to act like they did nothing and all this. I hate when people have to get all sneaky about shit. Just proves to me that there's no person in this entire world I can trust  completely.   I just wish one person would come into my life and make me happier, care about me, not hurt me...I just wish I didn't have to feel like this...
