Woe is me. :-( But on a more positive note, I sat next to Millie today and we lamented over the extremely tall UPS man because he was too young for her and too old for me.  There shall be a void in all of our lives from now on, for we are living it without seeing him.  Haha.     I got some stuff to bring to Hardee's later for Heather. She tried to call off of work, but being the witch that Cindy is, she "was not allowed." Whatever, don't tell me that of the growing list of employees, floating around 30, you couldn't get ahold of the other 25 who weren't working tonight? Sdaflkasjdf. I've still got to go get her some dinner, but I am not sure yet. Something that will last a while if she can't eat it right away. Maybe some chicken and rice soup and an eggroll.     Back to work tomorrow, but with Laura and Cindy so it's alright. Then I'm not working for the remainder of the week-- Friday, Saturday, and Sunday here I come!!     Note to self: Download "Let Love Keep Us Together" and call Marie tonight.
