We took pictures for Carol's French project. There's a really good one of me, Kevin, Danielle, and Kayla. I'll post it on here once Carol gives me a copy of it.  Well, I was supposed to go to Josh's with Kim to go swimming but then it started raining so we didn't go. So now I'm just talking to Gavin and listening to music.  Concert tonight at 7:30. Come watch if you want.  Oh, and tomorrow night is the National Honors Society dinner. I will serve those seniors their food and I will serve it well. lol  Listening to: [What You Say by Sugarcult]  Wait around, If the fires there to put it out. Lay me down, Emotions overrated now, rated now.  I dont wanna hear another word you say. I dont ever wanna waste another day. What you say what you say what you never say. Every single lie and youre afraid.  Wait around, To pick up lines to put me down. Scream and shout, Make it up to make it out, to make it out.  I dont wanna hear another word you say. I dont ever wanna waste another day. What you say what you say what you never say. Every single lie and youre afraid.  Lay me down, Emotions overrated now. Wait around, If the fires there to put me out.  I dont wanna hear another word you say. I dont ever wanna waste another day. What you say what you say what you never say. Every single lie and youre afraid.  Let me let, me out. Get me get, me out. Let me let, me out. Get me get, me out.  Wait around, If the fires there to put it out, Put me out, put it out.
