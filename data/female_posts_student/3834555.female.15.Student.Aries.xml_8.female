EVERYTHING!! which is acually pretty easy for me, cuz i only have black, red and one green and one blue shirts. so i can bring like 5 red shirts, 3 pairs of shorts that have lots of red on them and my red pj pants, plus i am bringing my black stuff too... for my show costume and to wear.... but that leaves me with NOTHING to wear today!! i could wear my black jeans but they are dirty and i have to wear them tommorow.... i already have to take one pair of shorts out of my bag for Saturday... so, i went to ask Jessica if i could wear a pair of her shorts tonight and she was like "no. you'll get them dirty and i dont want to smell like you." so i tried to convince her.... but nooooooooo. and just YESTERDAY i let her wear one of MY shirts! so now i have NO idea WHAT i am going to wear tonight?!!?!? i pry have to UNPACK my shorts and wear a pair of those! goll, i HATE "hate Karsen" dayz!! grrrrrr...
