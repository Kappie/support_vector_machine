Maybe some currents, just so I can post  something  of substance...  Oh yeah! I saw  Fahrenheit 9/11  on Saturday. I absolutely loved it (despite the footage of mangled Iraqis, during which I had to stare at the exit sign). It was really strange, though, when the manager of the theater made a little speech before the movie... He talked about how it was controversial, and then he had a  raffle  for popcorn coupons. It was quite odd. I bet his theater was bringing in a lot of cash for being the only one in Cedar Rapids whose manager is not in bed with the Republicans, as my dad puts it. Sure, Michael Moore's an asshole. But he's a really awesome asshole.   GRR I HATE BUSH!  Ahem.  Now, currents.  Current... Reading material:  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn  by Betty Smith. I finished  To Kill a Mockingbird  and then read  Animal Farm  by George Orwell, both of which were very good, of course. Knitting project: Still that stinkin' tank top. I finally finished the back of it. I just don't knit very often. Whatever. Odd food craving: Cheese quesadillas at Fiesta Del Sol.  Current...current...AHH! I swear my brain has disintegrated. Plus, it's before eight in the morning and I only got about three total hours of sleep, probably (I've been staying up late and sleeping until around one lately, and for whatever reason I am now trying to break this habit). I'm now at the phase of sleepiness when I'm just really hyper. I have trouble thinking when I'm this way.  So there, an entry, if not a very coherent one.
