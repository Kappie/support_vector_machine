So I am totally without communication today, and this is probably my only time on the computer this week(yeah...my mom probably won't want to over-indulge me by letting me get on twice in a one-week period...so I usally only get Thursdays). So, I'm a little unhappy. So...what has been going on in my life? Not much, I guess. Mostly work. I worked sixteen-and-a-half hours last week, my longest week yet. I got cast-off shifts from a couple of girls who are trying to get ready for college. And on Saturday, I traded for a closing shift. And, I have been on register twice since last Tuesday. Not bad. Oh, and I got a recognition certificate that i get to trade for some kind of prize. For great customer service and getting my trays when my name was called. So, work looks a lot better. So, other than that... I've had church stuff, of course. On Sunday all the youth went to Chuckie Cheese's. That was fun. We are so horribly immature. On Saturday, a friend from work who lives down the street invited me to swim at her house. And on Tuesday, I had a dentist appointment. They scheduled me to have my braces off on Augest eleventh. Of course, I'm elated about that. After they take them off, I'll have enough time to do White Strips before school starts. My teeth will be so beautiful...straight, and white, and no pieces of wire attatched to them with food stuck in. Yeah! And I have been back-to-school shopping. I got an order in from PacSun yesterday. I didn't order clothes from them, but some really cute accesories, and after making fun of the trucker hat I got in the buy-one-get-one accesory sale, my brother said he wanted one, too. And my mom said that my wristbands look like pieces of belt strapped to my arm. Oh well, I like them. I'm still waiting on an order from C28, a christian clothing site. I'm getting a pink One Truth shirt...I'm excited about that. I had to send my Hurley shoes back for a different size, but they are the absolute cutest shoes I have ever seen. And I have five pairs of brand new jeans hanging in my closet. Anyways, that is all quite boring, but I am really enjoying getting ready for school, and finally being able to put together a look that suits my personal taste. So, that's just what has been going on. I am desperately looking forward to getting back to school and having something interesting to write about.
