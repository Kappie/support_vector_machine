She asked why I needed a word and I told her it was for my title and she's asked if she could say another word. So she said sexy and I was like okay. But then I decided to put them together. Just felt like sharing that little story with ya. So today I woke up at around 10:30. I ate, got ready, and went to my grandpa's. I was pissed because my uncle was there and he's such an ass. I was worried because as Eddie, my mom, and I were driving down the street my grandpa is in the middle of the road going to the house across the street. My grandpa isn't good at walking anymore, he broke his hip awhile back. So I was like what the hell Grandpa?! But he was just putting some lady's newspaper on her front steps so it as a sweet thought but stuff like that was why he broke his hip in the first place. He was being thoughtful and taking out some lady's garbage and he slipped on ice and broke his hip. So we stayed there for awhile. It was kinda funny, my uncle lost his wallet and he was going crazy looking for it.  Sadly , he found it. So then I came home and fell asleep on the couch for awhile. I was being bitchy for awhile. I'm not sure why but I just was. I think I was just stressed about stuff. So then I woke up and went to paint a second coat on the trim of my big window. Then I came online. I got upset because I was talking to Maura about shit and what I asked her to find out for me  wasn't  good. I got pissed at myself because it was  my  fault. I couldn't blame anyone else for my screw up. And it just got me really depressed because I felt like I screwed up something really good. So then I went to soccer kinda upset. But with soccer, once I start practicing,  everything  fades from my mind. And I mean everything! Soccer wasn't too hard. But my foot hurt  sooo  bad. And my left one began to hurt to because I've been putting all my pressure on that foot. And in addition to this all, my shin splints are coming back so that's  just great!  Then I came home and ate and talked to people. Congrats go out to all the people who made volleyball. I'm am soo sorry to Lauren, Annie, Tracy, and whoever else didn't make the team. The coach is on crack! I  totally  forgot Chris asked me to come over so sorry Chris! So I just sat around relaxing. I tried to have a big convo with Eddie but he just didn't wanna talk about it. I dunno if he didn't like the topic or if it was because he was about to go out. I dunno, I just wish all he cared about  was if I was happy.  Not the other things he's worrying about. And my mom is no help either. She favors him. I know she does because he's the only boy. So we're gonna continue the convo once he gets home or tomorrow. Ah. Parents and siblings. Oh and Margaret had like a nervous breakdown tonight. She found out some shit and started bawling her eyes out. I laughed so she hit me. But I mean, come on.  The reason she was crying was fucking bull shit.  I really wish I could explain this one but people who are involved, read this so I can't. I just think it's crazy what she was saying and why she's crying. Oh well. Maybe I really was suppose to be the  big  sister. God knows, I act like it enough. No poem tonight. Too lazy.  Way  too lazy. I'm so tired. I might be going to bed really soon. Night night
