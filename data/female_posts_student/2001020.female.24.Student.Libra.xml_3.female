I really don't like Britney Spears, but her shit is annoying and stick in your head like peanut butter to the roof of your mouth. Anyway, last night I just hung out at Jed's with a guy I used to consider my best friend. I don't think we even have the right to consider each other that way anymore. It's sad. I totally adore him, love him to death. I asked him if it bothers him, the situation between us, and he said, "It's been four years. I'm just used to the way it is now." I wanted to cry. He means so much to me, but to me it always seems like he's running away from the people that want to be in his life. He flocks to the people that want an unattached way of life like his. I mean, I can't force him back into my life, and I can't jump right back into his. I wish it wasn't so complicated, but when we were back in high school, it all seemed so easy. And he was someone who really made me think...I just have a hard time believing that we've truly grown apart. I miss him. I know it will never be the same. Losing touch sucks, it really does. I am still happy (like yesterday), and telling people that I broke up with the ex makes me feel all the more empowered, but I'm feeling a little down about circumstances.
