It is like one of those corny movies where the main character says the perfect, witty thing to the second main character before kissing her... I think I am turning into a hopeless romantic... Oh dear... When I grow a little older, I might actually turn away from my usual bookcase of fantasy books and historical fiction and to the mushy, gushy, romance novels!!!!!     Things in my world seem to be changing so fast. I'm loving romance novels, I started caring about my weight, I have completely different views... I thought that I would never change. I mean, I knew people changed but I just sort of thought that I'd always be the same, that everyone else would become different and that I'd always have the same interests and junk. Personally, I don't like change... It twists peoples thoughts... Like, for instance, I absolutely hate smoking for it pollutes the air and damages people's healths. What happens, if one day, I change and actually tries smoking, likes it, and then dies from it a couple of months after my first try?     It's weird that I'm posting to you about God, dreams, depression, and romance novels; isn't it? I guess you could call this entire blog thingy, 'Koala Peace: My Useless Thoughts on Miscellaneous Subjects and Other Things.' However, that would be too long of title... Perhaps something like, 'Koala Peace: Miscellaneously Me.' Well, that's a little better, don't you think? Oh, well. 'Koala Peace' is perfectly fine with me. I don't need anything more complex in order to keep writing in this blog. Nope, the simple way is the best for me.     I'm not a very materialistic person. I don't need precious diamonds, desinger clothes, shiny gadjets, and the rest of that other really expensive stuff that extremely rich people have. Nope, I'm much happier with the things I already have. I loathe change so what do you expect? Anyways, I liked older, antique things... They are full of memories. New things just seem to be pathetically big and phony. I'd rather have something that is steady and decent rather then anything big, bright, and bold...     Well, I'm outie.
