Is that how u want to leave  Abandoning us here only to grieve   Ur gone prematurely even though u shouldn’t  Leaving us to deal with what u couldn’t  Too much strain now, my shell starts to crack  With out you here life begins to lack   Did u ever think how we would feel?  Without u around us nothing can heal  What we are having to go through,  Having to live hear without you   Let these thoughts go through your head  Think of this next time when you wish to be dead  and if after all that, if your thoughts continue to mount  Just remember we love you, tell me that has to count.   another one just letting people know that they are special...
