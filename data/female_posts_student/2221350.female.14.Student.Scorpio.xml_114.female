This phrase is the source of the sense of bats or batty meaning eccentric or insane, which both appear in the first decade of the 20th century. A belfry is a likely place to find bats and the phrase is simply a jocular expression similar to not playing with a full deck or his elevator does not run all the way to the top. In this case the belfry represents the head and brain and bats were chosen for alliterative purposes and because the creatures can be found there.  I've got bats in my belfry... Sounds like a code phrase for some horrible STD. I started wondering about this around 2 this morning when I heard noises coming from the fireplace in the living room.   did you ever think about the cave man-esque simplicity of the word fireplace? It's like fireplace-a place for fire. Vote that we change this to something more complicated to fit our complicated lives. pyrort((Greek 'pyro' "fire" German 'ort' "place")), or branndehouder((Norwegian 'brann' "fire" and Dutch 'de houder' "holder of")), or Flamlar ((German 'flamme' "flame" and Portugese 'lar' "home")), or caithastoomuchtimeonherhands?
