Then, only, may the Warhorse   and Warrior arise  To rally the warhosts, and thunder   the skies.  But first there must assemble   ones icari would claim.  A bride in the temple   must enter the flame,  With steeds found for six brothers, beyond   a dust deepsea,  And new arrows reckoned, a wand   given wings —  That when a princess-royal’s   to have tasted of the tree,  Then far from Esternesse’s   city, these things:  A gathering of gargoyles,    a feasting on the stone,  The Witch of Westernesse’s   hag overthrown.  Whereafter shall commence   such a cruel sorceress War,  To wrest recompense   for a land leaguered sore.  With her broadsword Bright Burning,   the shadow Black-as-Night,  From exile returning,   shall dare dragons’ might  For love of one above who, flag unfurled,   lone must stand,  The pearl of the soul of the world   in her hand.  When Winterock to water   falls flooding, foes to drown,  Ravenna’s own daughter   shall kindle the crown.”
