I drank two Mountain Dew LiveWires this morning...they taste suspiciously like orange freeze-pops. And I like them too. I was an orange fan, but never grape...something to do with a bad experience with Dimetapp.  So, the movies....   Basic  was the one I watched last night. Wowwie. That was a really frickin' good movie, you all need to see it. Augh...it really really screwed with my head. When the credits started rolling I was sitting there shaking my head going, "No, no...that's bullshit." YES! That's how good it was. And it has some pretty big names to overshadow the smaller ones, but the smaller ones do take some precedence...not that that will get them anywhere in their acting careers, but still. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, HOO-AH! It was really good, and if you want a movie where, at the end, you're shaking your head going, "No, no...that's bullshit," this is the one.  And today, just a few minute ago actually, I watched  The Animatrix . If I'm not mistaken it came on MTV for a while. It's a collection of  nine "cartoons" essentially dealing with aspects of  The Matrix , and there was a lot of shit said about it, but I don't know why...it was cool on about a thousand levels, two in particular. Firstly, it had incredible storylines, and as a sub-cool, they all dealt with aspects of  The Matrix  that  Reloaded  couldn't quite make clear, or other things that weren't explained. They explain programming errors like "ghosts" and "haunted houses" better in one nine-minute short than they did in the whole "anomalies" bit in  Reloaded . They also discuss a lot of things that were left to our imaginations after the first two movies...the machine's takeover is explain, that curious little line in the first one, "It was us who scorched the sky," is explained. It actually justifies the actions of the machines and the actions of the humans thereafter, and it's basically a classic tale of neverending eye-for-eye, still prevalent in ideals like "human rights"...nobody is happy with living the middle ground, they always have to be on top.  And the second level of cool that's worth noting...the animation styles. The first episode,  The Final Flight of The Osiris  is totally 3D, a la  Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within . The rest are varying forms of Japanimation, which, if you like animé, you'd be in love with these. They took about a thousand different directors and put them on different projects, so that they could encompass a different form in every episode...it was totally cool getting all those different perspectives on animation...and yes, I am one of those little animé fanboys, surprise! O well...back to what I was saying....granted, the last episode is little more than a great big CGI experiment with a subplot of little relevance to boot, but in general, it's worth checking out. If not for the "Now I get it/ I'm a  Matrix  geek" bonus, there was some good story telling and pretty cool/gross animation.   And now that I'm done rambling you can ignore this post and pretend like I'm not a total loser with nothing else better to do than BLog about movies and be an EMO kid.  Here's lookin' at you, kids.
