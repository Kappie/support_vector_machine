I dont know how I could be so stupid to break up with him I should have just talked about it and not believed everyone else.  I MISS HIM. I took him his birthday present today and I dropped it off at his house he wasnt home so I just gave it to his mom.  I talked to him later on that day and man I didnt realize how much I missed him and how much fun I had with him it is weird how someone can change you so much and you now even know it.  I try to be happy when I am around all my friends but you see everyone else that has a b/f or a g/f and you just think where is the other half of you at.  I miss my other half he always made me happy and made me samile when I was sad. I guess you dont realize just how happy you are till you lose something or someone so hold on to whatever you have and dont take anything for granted.  Jess
