We had fun for the most part then we decided we were going to indulge in a little alcohol consumption. I have to admit that I might have drank a little too much last night, I had two 16 oz glasses of a drink called the Washington Apple and one 8 oz bottle of mudslide (but thats all I remember drinking). I warned my friends that I couldn’t handle my alcohol plus it had been a very, very long time since I last indulged like that. Any way long story very short, I wound up crying about how I miss Jesse and how him being overseas was unfair, for about a ½ an hour.   I guess the only way I can drink now is if Jesse is here, otherwise all I will do is cry about how I miss him.   No more drinking for me.
