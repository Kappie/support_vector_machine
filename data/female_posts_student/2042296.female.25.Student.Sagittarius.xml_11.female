I just like to do things the easy way, you know.   I'm currently staying in Switzerland and I must say, that it looks like I'm gonna stay here longer... I just love this country and I just love my swiss boyfriend and I could actually study and live and learn and work here! So we'll see, what happens. I had a summer job in the mountains in a hotel and now I'm looking around to find a job here until I get a place in the Zürich university or so.   I'm writing in English, because I thought it would be most convenient for all the people I know. I wanted to write either in Finnish or German, but since I have a lot of international friends, who don't understand Finnish and/or German, I picked up English. And as a former English major student I'm sorry for all the mistakes I make due to my exposure to the german language... The german influences can surely be seen in my words and syntax etc. But hey, my writing isn't that bad, you should here me speaking English these days!;)   Today I'm struggling with my translation dingsda...the word I'm looking for is...Übersetzungsarbeit, verdammt nochmal...translation work/job/something like that. I'm translating an error description list of a machine tool, german-finnish. Blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Highly interesting. But at least I'm getting paid.   It's a very beautiful day here. The sun is shining and the air is fresh. My only problem is that I don't have any warm clothes with me... I wasn't planning to stay this long here! Would it help if I wore 5 summer dresses at the same time?;)   So it's 4:59 pm and I haven't done anything reasonable today. I should get something done before my man Rico comes home from work (he's an engineer), cause I know that after that I won't get anything done. We'll probably cook something and then watch The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on dvd. It's just so easy to be with him and do things, our interests are so similar. And we have a lot to talk about, too. Well, I'm very sorry that not every woman can have a man like Rico! ;D   Ok, I'm just gonna go back and show the error dingsda who's the boss! And I'm gonna stop thinking that it's still 24 days left to Iron Maiden concert in Zürich and 44 to Muse here in Wettingen... ;) Besides, I'm already making my IRC friends crazy by asking "how do you say this in English?" ;)   Have a nice day, till later!   ----------------------------------   Whoopee...  It's 5:28 and I still haven't done anything remarkable today. I've been struggling with words like "Wechselvorgang", "Kontrollschalter" and "Wechselgreif-Element". It seems that my dictionaries don't know a shit... Well, Rico is coming home soon. Haha, I told him in IRC that he's not FORCED to use the spacebar after a sentence (he keeps on pressing that after a sentence, before the full stop etc.) and that's what he said:  - ja wart du nur... komme jetzt nach hause und dann geb ich dir spacebar !!!!  Haha;) In english that would be: yeah, you just wait...i'm coming home now and then I'll give you some spacebar!!! :D  I'm hungry.
