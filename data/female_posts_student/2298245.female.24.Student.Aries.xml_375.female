Rowling's Official Site  and  urlLink discovered the title of Book 6 , claiming it was  Harry Potter and the Pillar of Storge  (the "e" should have an acute accent, but I don't know how to do that).  For a while, the fans toiled in agony,  urlLink wondering if it was true or not , mostly concluding that it was not.  Then, confirmation came from Rowling herself:   urlLink it was a hoax .  Then, a new twist, as Potter fans  urlLink discovered something new on Rowling's site , another title, this one  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince , apparently a rejected title for Book 2.   urlLink The Leaky Cauldron  is  urlLink confirming that this is indeed the title of Book 6 , from a very mysterious and anonymous, but apparently reliable, source.  Now Potter fans across the globe are trying to discern the meaning of the title, and just who the mysterious "Half Blood Prince" is going to turn out to be.  If you don't believe me, just check out some of the comments on the last link.  I don't know what to think.  I do know one thing:  I trust the folks over at Leaky, so as long as they say that this is the title, I think I'll stick with them, even if I don't know the identity of their source.  They are always very cautious with the information they give out, so if they are confirming, I've pretty much got to believe it.    Knowing the title is all well and good, but I'd feel much better if I knew a release date.  Or better yet, if I actually had the book in my hand, and were reading it right now...  But, alas, I do not.  So I guess it's back to reading cases.
