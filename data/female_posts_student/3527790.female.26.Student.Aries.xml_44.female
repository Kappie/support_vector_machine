However I am not ready for another relationship I don't think it would matter if it was the hottest guy on earth I just am not ready for that.   That is not the point of this blog. The point of this blog is that despite his feelings for me he listens almost readily to me as I talk about the idiot boy. I hate to talk about it to him though because I know it must bother him but he is willing to listen. Which is so nice.  Anyways I wasted the morning at the Dr.'s office but its all good because in 3 days I'll be fit and healthy again! Thank goodness. I was worried that it might interfere with my Tri in July. But I only need to be on meds for 3 days!  Anyways I need to call Molly and talk to her about stuff plus I need to call a potential participant and tell him for the upmteenth time that he can't participate. My supervisor was supposed to do it BUT surprise, surprise she didn't and now it is up to me...again!
