Being a woman I am going through my monthly imbalance of Hormones and I find that really all I want to do is go home and go to sleep. When I talked to Jesse earlier today and told him all I really wanted to do was go home and go to bed and he happily agreed. Seriously what I wouldn’t give just to have one night with him, holding me while I sleep, just like old times. Each day I push onward knowing that ones its over I can mark another day off my calendar. With each passing day, it brings me one day closer to having him home. I guess that is what drives me to get up in the morning and to face each day head on. It is also very comforting to hear Jesse say he feels the same way.  Today While I was listening to the radio I heard this song. I remember a conversation with my sister a few weeks back. She had told me whenever she heard this song it made her thing of Jesse and I. SO today I went in search for the lyrics to share with all of you. The song is a very beautiful one and I am thinking of trying to get a hold of the CD just so I can share this song with Jesse when he comes home.   BAND: Train ALBUM: My Private Nation: lyrics  SONG: When I Look To The Sky   When it rains it pours and opens doors And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love That have to say goodbye  And as I float along this ocean I can feel you like a notion that won’t seem to let me go  Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you’re here with me And you make everything alright  And when I feel like I’m lost something tells me you’re here with me And I can always find my way when you are here  And every word I didn’t say that caught up in some busy day And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn’t dance before And every sunset that we’ll miss I’ll wrap them all up in a kiss And pick you up in all of this when I sail away  Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly But with you I can spread my wings to see me over everything that life may send me  When I am hoping it won’t pass me by  And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me there you are to show me
