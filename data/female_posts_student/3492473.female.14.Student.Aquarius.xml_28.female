And if I lose Chris to taking a break,  then I guess it wasn't meant to be.  Sigh... I still have to deal w/ the people who stab me in the back quite often yet call themselves my friends... One, for example, told everyone at VASJ to hate me if I decide to go there. Two were in on trying to break Chris and me up. (and one of them blamed it all on the one who I hate) Someone asked the one I hate to convince Chris to break up w/ me. So I guess what happened, really  made everyone else happy .
