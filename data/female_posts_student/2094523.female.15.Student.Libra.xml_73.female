For years ive never said a peep about shit that happens, ive never spazzed @ anyone and now..well its come down to the point where I've met reality so therefore u get these blogs of bitterness.   People dont respect each other enough no matter how much you respect them personaly in the end it doesnt matter. Coz ure only one single person in their world only one person that means nothing what so ever. Stop trickin your self thinking u deserve attention. because I know im not gonna be as important in someones life as i am important in myne. lifes like that
