She kissed him, and he kissed her. They kissed until it wasn't any longer. It was something so much more. They were communicating; talking to each other in a new language known only to them; understanding only by the movements of their lips and tongues. Their passion burned so violently that the sand beneath them melted and turned to glass, which shattered, reflecting the brilliance of the infant sun.  Affholder, great poem.  :-D
