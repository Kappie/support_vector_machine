So I decided to try Blogger, LJ, and Xanga, and Blogger won, mainly cuz of this  awesome skin/template whatever you wanna call it thing (and cuz  urlLink Zach's  looked  really cool too, altho it's not very colorful.)  I'll prolly stick to  this template  for  awhile, tho I might tweak it  a  bit.    Anyways, I'm just gonna go do this post  for now, fix up all my settings, then make an actual post later tonight or tomorrow.
