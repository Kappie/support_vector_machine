I've cleaned up all relevant birthday paraphernalia from the kitchen, but I don't want to touch anything more. What will I do tomorrow? Anything from now on is basically anticlimactic. If I had to go back to school tomorrow, I'd be satisfied already.  Everything's so right, and priceless. I wish I could sit here painlessly and just sit here. There's only so many perfect days, this is the third I really remember in recent history. Let's keep it that way.   So here I am. I have a Death Cab chorus playing over and over in my head: "I loved you Guinevere, I loved you Guinevere, I loved you..." And repeat.  Life is good. I don't need to get caught down here so late, though. We'll see.
