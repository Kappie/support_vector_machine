I ended up getting two sweaters and another shirt. The shirt only cost me $7 and it was from Gap! Gap doesn't usually have prices like that so...I was excited! :)  Tomorrow, I think I'm just going to sit around all day.   It was really sad. A good friend of my family died today. And Peter had a death in his family too. It's really really depressing and it just all reminds me of my grandma last year. That was so tough.   I don't think I want to start thinking about this again. I started thinking about it so much when I first started talking to Peter and...ugh, I'm NOT going to think about this.  So, anyway, depending on when the funeral is for this friend of my family, I may not get to go to the marching thing on Tuesday anyway. I was unsure in the first place if I was going to go since I didn't want to miss schooll but yeah...  Anyway, I think I'm going to go sleep. Good night.
