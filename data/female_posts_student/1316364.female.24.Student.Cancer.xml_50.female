I have found that today my mind has wandered as far back as our first date, to the events that lead to our first date, and everything up to today. I find that little things tend to remind me of Jesse. I just wish that this month goes by just as fast as the last four have.   Nothing Else Matters ~ Metallica/Black Album   So close no matter how far couldn't be much more from the heart forever trusting who we are and nothing else matters  never opened myself this way life is ours, we live it our way all these words I don't just say and nothing else matters  trust I seek and I find in you every day for us something new open mind for a different view and nothing else matters  never cared for what they do never cared for what they know but I know  so close no matter how far couldn't be much more from the heart forever trusting who we are and nothing else matters  never cared for what they do never cared for what they know but I know  never opened myself this way life is ours, we live it our way all these words I don't just say and nothing else matters  trust I seek and I find in you every day for us something new open mind for a different view and nothing else matters  never cared for what they say never cared for games they play never cared for what they do never cared for what they know and I know  so close no matter how far couldn't be much more from the heart forever trusting who we are no nothing else matters
