Let me break it down for you...  -I'm 16.  -I'm 5'4.5"  -I have dark brown hair, green eyes, and I'm as pale as can be.  -I'm a 41-31-41.  -I weigh 195 lbs (on a good day).  I used to weigh 222, then I joined Weight Watchers. All was well and good, and two years later I weighed 170. It was wonderful! I was wearing a size 10, my waist was 28 inches, and I felt amazing. Unfortunatly, I couldn't keep the weight off. I gained back half of what I had lost the first time, and now I can barely fit into a size 12. It's miserable. I'm getting ready to start school again (my junior year), and I look just like I did when I left in June. F-A-T.  Well, I'm done with that. No more trying to squeeze into my old "thin" jeans. No more worrying about wether or not my calves are jiggling when I'm walking. No more hiding my arm fat under long sleeves in the summer. I'm going to watch what I eat and excersize. More importantly, I'm going to submit my activities to you fine people for approval. It's group support. Here we go...  Breakfast: Whole grapefruit with two packets of NutraSweet Mug of Strawberry Citrus tea  Lunch: Bok Choy with dressing (1 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar), and 1/2 block of Ramen Noodles  That's it for now. Later I think I'll do some weight training.
