All my friends are saying I'm so lucky, after you blurt out to someone that you like them, usually they don't like you back. Usually they haven't been attracted to you since god knows when. And when you've kinda liked them since, EVER! (Well, not ever, but elementary school) it's rare thatthey would like you back. All my friends go, awwww!, whenever I mention them, and I have a huuuge smile plastered on my face.   I guess this summer is, for sure, going to be better than last year. For sure. And I'm glad.  After the depressing events from that, I felt I had to improve for this summer. And I almost didn't make it, because I lost a friend (serves him right anyways), and another one of mine is gone for most of the summer, and BOB AND JANE WON'T WRiTE ME BACK. Some kind of problem with their arms, I'm thinking. :D   My ass feels like it's still sitting on my air matteress. Which is SUCH a cool feeling...I love it:)
