One of my favorite Biblical stories is of the Tower of Babel. Babel: We try to build a tower to reach God, and thus gain all his power and knowledge.  But he strikes down the tower and creates different languages so that we could not communicate to build such a thing again. I,Robot: Tallest building, find knowledge of God like comparison, struck down. Bible: Jesus, Judas, Mary Magdeline I,Robot: (spoiler) Dr. kills himself to enlighten the rest, like Jesus. Sunny, does the killing ultimatley and fufills a profecy so that said dr. is killed to profide us with enlightenment.   Spooner is Paul, denies the Dr. three times before accepting it.  Chick he is with Mary Magdaline.... So that is my in depth analysis thus far.  There is also some cyberpunk relation in the beginging and I am sure the book goes into it much more, but it was very cool.  As your God as my witness - Futurama
