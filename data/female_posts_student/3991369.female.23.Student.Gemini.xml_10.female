I didn't know what to say,more because i didn't know why i had to say.We tried to step out quitely so she wouldn't know we are leaving,but everytime,she did the same,and gave us a clever smile"oh,where are you going?"Mum always answered her,as if she had to."I am taking her to an english class.."..."oh we have an appointment at the dentist...".."we are having dinner out"..  Then she would have asked where the class is ,which dentist,what are we going to have for dinner,...I was mad.  Mum always answered her.  I hated mum.I hated the next door.  when i asked mum why should you answer her,she said "shhhh,zeshte,aberoomoon mire."sorry but i found no equal phrase in english that would match her saying,maybe because it doesn't exisits.  the neighbor was my aunt.and only 30.
