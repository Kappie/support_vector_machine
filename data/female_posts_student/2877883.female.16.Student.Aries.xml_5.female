But it is about the only festivity in this otherwise such boring day.  I just finished my first essay for history and it is dumb but I used a lot of big words (for me) and so that is lovely.  Now, I must read the 60 or so pages that I still need to read from my book for my history term project.  And after that I need to write a whole other essay, again for history.  Then I shall need to read about 60 or so pages for English too (whish I must admit is more enjoyable but still something I'm forced to do).  This is going to be a long day.    So, also, yesterday my mother and I went to Wrentham after the BC vs. UCONN basketball game, which was super cool and I saw Miss Sarah there so that was also cool.  So at Wrenthem, my mother needed to find a new suit at the Kasper store because she has a lot of meetings in Boston this week.  So, actually the one she chose was quite nice, but it is amazing how long people can spend in a suit store.  We were in there for over an hour, definitely.  It's really weird because one of the ladies who works there, whom I now know is named Allison, I definitely remember from the last time I was there and it was just weird.  Even weirder was that I remembered that she has a son named Tristan, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how I knew that, so that was weird.  So after that long long long-ness in the suit store, we went to a Puma store, but it was not cool at all like our wicked super cool Puma outlet.  Then we went to the Gap outlet and I got a really pretty black short sleeve shirt that is really hard to describe, but yesterday was the day that we first started shopping for my birthday, which was uber cool, but that means that I don;t get to have my lovely shirt or the cool denim capris that I got at Old Navy until my birthday.  I found the coolest olive green capris that I loved, but they only had one pair an d it was a size too small so I definitely wasn't super psyched about that one.  Then we ate at Chili's again and came home and I can't remember what else I did after that.  Oh yeah, I think I just read my magazine that I got yesterday.  It had a really sad story about this school that has had so many deaths in just a few months.  It was so sad.  Then I went to bed.  Lovely.
