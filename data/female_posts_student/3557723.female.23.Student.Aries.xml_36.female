I'm going to go to the ballet tomorrow night being held at the Civic Grounds. Should be a good night. It's outdoors and it will be cold. I'm making spring rolls for it. But I will have to double check on the status of taking food. There's been so many last minute changes with the thing so far. First tickets were at $40 per adult, and now they're $15 per adult. Four performances by the West Australian Ballet Company. The proceeds are going towards the town's hospital so it's a good cause as well as a good night out.  Will be posting up photos of me and my cats sometime tonight, then a mass e-mail letting everyone know this blog exists. ^_~
