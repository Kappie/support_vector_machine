Splendiferous.  Nosferatu.  And other ridiculous words.  Sooo...I still have to check out ticket prices for the Nickelback/3 Doors Down concert that I HAVE TO GO TO NO MATTER FREAKING WHAT!!! I love Nickelback!!!  One of my best friends is trying to go with me and I am fully committed on going.   And dat's dat.  Hee hee hee...  Damn, I wish I really was in Ireland.  I really can't stand America.  It's so messed up, know?  My Irish citizenship is in limbo right now, and after college, I'm moving there.  I love my country, but I just can't stay here while it's like this.  It's too hard to see it destroying itself from the inside out.  Makes me sick.    It is currently just a little after one a.m. in the United Kingdom, and presumably Ireland too.  God, I wish I was over there.  So freaking bad.  England would do just fine.  So would mfing Scotland.  Just something other than America.  It's boring.  It's messed up.  We're lemmings.  Brainwashed into a pathetic state of blind obedience.  I...oh, buttmuffins. For-freaking-get it.  PS: Last night's episode of Monk sucked.  I was so disappointed.   love, catherine (who wishes she were on the emerald isle)  She's fading away Away from this world Drifting like a feather She's not like the other girls She lives in the clouds And talks to the birds hopeless little one She's not like the other girls I know...
