I had walked and stood in the rain for about an hour, and was pleased when I smelled a fire walking up to the door of my house.  My roommate had a roaring fire going, and all the lights out.  I peeled out of my wet boots and socks, I stripped off my coat and hat, and laid there in the blazing heat that came out in a steady red light.  At one point I called a friend and had to abandon the fire for a while, but while I talked to him I found my guitar.  After the hour of chatting I went back down to the living room, still dark, still warm, and curled up in the chair that was abandoned in the quest for ice cream.  A good quest, noble.  I was all for it, as long as I got to sit in the chair, in the semi dark, and pick sound from strings.  One roommate gone for ice cream, the other gone to bed, there was quiet that I filled with old songs and random bursts of music.  He returned from his quest, doubly triumphant with both sorbet and ice cream (vanilla, clearly the best of the choices) and we ate, and then he retired.  I sang to myself songs that are steeped in memory.  They are Beetles songs that my father would sing us as he played on his guitar.   Once there was a way to get back homeward... once there was a way to get back home... sleep pretty darling do not cry, and I will sing you a lullaby...      When a book is truly good, you will return to it year after year and find that you have a deeper understanding of the meaning, that it is resonating in a way that is new to your experience, but just as true.  Occationally, this happens with words or sentences.  Things that had previously had only one meaning become deeper, truer, and they have more flesh on their small symbols.  So it was for going homeward.  Suddenly, as I quietly sang, I felt melancholy echo in me.  I felt a space widen into a silent night, where home is far away, and right with you.  I stepped into a different place with the meaning- the soul of a word that will bite into you and never let go.  It sat heavy in me, but was comforting as well. Memories and ghosts silently walked by, respectful of the dark fire light, and gave me another layer of thought to contemplate.  If you have felt this resounding with a word, you know what I mean.  The first time when you understood that love was encompassing of pain?  That love was truly and deeply not the opposite of hate, but was a different alchemy of it all.  Finally I spoke to the darkness, quiet, urgent, recognizing it for what it was- mirror, metaphor, self, and god.    Today I have walked in the rain, and snow, and talked about coincidence, and found a new space to hide and watch the world.  There was good conversation, a flow from earlier revelations leading, once again, to the confirmation of intuition.  thank you.  I said it last night to the dark, and I say it again, on this public private place of knowledge, to the chaotic gods of woven order, and to those who share the ride.  Thank you.
