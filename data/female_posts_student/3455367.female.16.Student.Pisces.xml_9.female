Mmm im so hungry, they r cooking spag bog and thats exactly what i feel like eating right now. OH about the party last night ..it was so fun. There was the fat fire that we spent half the night sitting around. We got there at about 9:30..Me n Joelle were gonna go to a doof afterwards but when we were leaving the party we were all too tired and really couldnt be bothered ..The party was fun enough. Maya turned up at about 11 or 12 or something..i dont remember, i mean i hadnt been drinking but i still dont remember what time it was. The set up of the party was pretty kool. i mean they had a dance floor with kool lights n black lights n shit. And then they had the fire with lots of logs n shit to sit on...And it was just kool.  Joelle is out in the lounge room near the heater so im gonna over there. check.
