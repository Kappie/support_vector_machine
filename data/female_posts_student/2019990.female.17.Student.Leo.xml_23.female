Apparently normally when I sing I'm only like a step to a half step off but this time I was a whole staricase off.  But really, it's like laughing and throwing things at the stupid kid.  It's not funny, It's not fair.  How can I atone?  Are you okay? (sorry Rent tangent).  Oh and I finished my Hawaii movie today, and I got Abner's LOTR spoof on tape, so all I have left school wise is the Yearbook, but they always work into the summer, so it's not surprising.   I would like to give a big thanks to Mahinda for helping me to resurect my links, and chatter box.  We are enterally grateful.  And as far as I know my quiz is now functional.     I have decided that it's time to bring back the 50's era high pony tail.  It's similar to sparkly things in that it makes me very happy.   Much like sparkly things.  Which as you already know are the key to happiness.  Next year for prom (if I go) I want to go with a 50's inspired dress.  Ivory satin with a greenstripe acrossed my ribs.  I'm so excited.  Even if I don't go to prom I still want to make it a wear it everyday.  With my high ponytail, and little ivory heels.   And of course sparkly jewelry.   Well I lost my train of thought.  I'll reboard when I find my ticket.  Until later.
