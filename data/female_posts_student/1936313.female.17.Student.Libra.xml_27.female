I think it would've been a lot less stressful to just give up on being educated and run off and do that..)  I'm officially registered at Medicine Hat College.. First Semester: Logic, English, History, French and huh. .can't remember my 5th course all of a sudden.... but its there......... I have to take French.. because they're stupid and won't let me take Spanish since I've taken it in highschool. Stupid College.  I'm also supposedly screwed because I don't have a 30-level science.... Its not my fault I nearly failed Chem 20!!.. uh.... okay.. maybe.... sooo I have to make it up this summer or something..... or I can take Astronomy... if UofR will accept it as a transfer over.... I hope so -crosses fingers- astronomy is something I can handle. Chem isn't.  Either way I'm registered, and owe like.. $1900 already... and thats just tuition and healthcare for the first semester... its another $1400 for student residence.. etc etc etc..... I'm going to die.  ..........  I also went to see Mark and give him back his stuff........ Why do I put myself on these emotional rollercoasters?...... -sighs- I cried all the way back to the college and then had to make myself look normal for the tour and such again.... I seriously don't know if I could handle going to college down there......  WHY do I always chose the hard road? I don't know...... Its stupid.... I should've agreed to run off with Michael when I had the chance.... things would've certainly been different...... Its not like i lacked the chance to....  FUCK...... no regrets......  I'm seriously depressed now....... but my lifes somewhat put into perspective by other things so I'm just going to shut up..... I have nothing to complain about.     - -....Now I'm strong enough to live without you.. Strong enough to quit crying.. Long enough now I'm strong enough.. To know you gotta go....Come hell or waters high.. You'll never see me cry.. This is Our last goodbye, Its true....- -
