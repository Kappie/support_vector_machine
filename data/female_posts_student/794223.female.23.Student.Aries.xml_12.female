That's right...our president will actively defy both houses of Congress and (probably) a majority of the American people's opinion (again). Let me reiterate: if he "wins" again, I'm moving indefinately to either Cuba or Brazil, depending on the circumstances and my mood.  Random favourite quotation of the day: "That man has raisins in his brain case!"
