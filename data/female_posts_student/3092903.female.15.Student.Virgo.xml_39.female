I woke up all light headed I guess from lack of sleep and I think I took a shower while I was still asleep.. Oh God, I hope I wasnt just dreaming, I HOPE i bathed today.. Oh well! Nah, I'm positive i did, because my hair was wet all day. So anyway, I was super light headed, and I figured, oh i have plenty of time to get ready so I'm just gonna let my head quit pounding and wait until these blue spots in front of my face go away, so I laid down on the bathroom floor and so I brushed my teeth while I was laying there and I did my whole routine from the floor. It was kinda cool. Man, tonight was some kind of funny after practice. I went out to eat with the girls, and I was just crackin up. I could not even breathe I was laughing so hard at all the crap that happened. It was cool. I hadn't hung out with the girls in a while.
