I was always happy in front of my friends and never showed any sign of how I actually feeled.  But writing has helped me to feel the way I was acting.  And for Liz and Jenessa, I didn't do this because I thought it was cool.  Or because I wanted to take something for you.  It's because I'm not good at keeping a diary and I really needed a place to put my emotions.  I had no one to talk about my feelings with.  No one knew.  At least you guys had each other.  I still have no one.  But this is just an aid for me.  Anyway lets just say someone said something mean and it got me really mad and I wanted to cry my eyes out because for about two hours I couldn't help but thinking he hated me.  But anyway,  I have this huge tournament in Gatlinburg coming up.  It's three days long.  Now I was chatting with Lindsay George and Sara Fon last night and we're the only ones that know, but it is know among upper classmen that Gatlinburg is known for the initiation of freshmen girls.  But we thought it would be funny if we pulled a prank on Jake and Ferrell cause Michael won't be there.  I have it all planned out.  MATERIALS NEEDED  tampons  condoms (lubricated) thongs  bras camera   STEP 1  Practical Jokes like: 1) sticking tampons on their door  2) putting bras and thongs in their luggage or "carry-on" 3) condoms everywhere they look   STEP 2  MESS WITH THEIR HEADS 1) flirt with them 2) make good eye contact 3) act hard to get   STEP 3  THE MESSAGE Send a message to their room that reads something like two young women would like to meet you somewhere but only if they bring a thong and a bra.   STEP 4  THE FINALE When they show up Sara and Lindsay will come out and greet them and ask them what they're doing out.  Or they will be the two waiting for them.  When they have the thong and bra.  I'll be hiding and take a picture.  Or maybe in the note say that they can come only if they wear the bra and thong outside their clothes and then I take a pic and show everyone what idiots boys can be.  Anyway it'll be fun and Lindsay knows who I like and I can't tell Rachel because she hates him to death.    Ta Ta For Now
