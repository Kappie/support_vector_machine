But on the downfall - I'm starting to realize what people REALLY think of me having this surgery and to be quite honest its really hurtful. Like I choose to be THIS fat and then have to have this sort of major surgery. I didn't have it so I can be a size 6 or get the men or whatever.... I had it so I'd be healthier, why is that so hard to believe? I'm not going to actually tell someone whats in my medical file because really its none of there business but you would think if they cared just a tiny bit they'd be more supportive instead of puting me in to tears and making me feel like some huge failure.  Blah. I knew this was going to be hard but I never imagined it being THIS hard because I really did think friends would be a hell of alot more supportive then they are. I should of known better or maybe I'm just in the wrong crowd? I dunno but at this point I just don't know where I belong yet - Hopefully soon that will change.  I wish Josh or Tonya was around - They always make me see the postive side of things and I know for a fact they support me through this. I'm a lucky girl for that too.
