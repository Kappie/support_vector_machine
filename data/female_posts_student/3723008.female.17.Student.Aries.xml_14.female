I stole a book.. well .. she told me to steal it.. 'Tis by Frank McCourt... I read the first book, Angela's Ashes... and loved it. I really recommend that book.. It's a true story bout an old, poor Irish family.. and how their father was a drunkard... and abandoned the family.. and the eldest son, Frank, had to work to support them.. anyhoo.. she left me on Tuesday morning, I got a txt from her at around 4 though... hmm.. I miss her... We chat online every day, most of the time twice for the day.. but its not the same... 24 days again... I'll live.. Tuesday.. I don't remember what I did on Tuesday... oh yes, I got up around 12, dad called at 12:45 and told me that I had lessons at 1.. for three hours... ugh.. so I barely had time to bathe properly.. but I did.. and I got there just 10 mins late.. I hate to reach late... but.. hmm.. So that was Tuesday... Wednesday... went tile hunting up Trincity.. took a spin in the mall and saw 2 tops that I want... (anybody willing to spend $300 on me, tell me) and after hmm... weeks and weeks of tile hunting I actually persuaded mom to buy this particular one .. its kinda nice... n yeah... that was my Wednesday.. Thursday.. went to the cinema avec Val, Jiggy, Shameer n Clayton... I honestly think Spiderman 2 was shit, however I am going to see it again, and maybe not focus on the million times he got unmasked.. and unmasked himself... and Doc. Ock's arms ... looked like snakes.. I hate that... grr... Friday... I did nothing... I think... nah I didn't do anything.. I can't remember if I really called Dad, or if I dreamt it.. but I think I called him.. asking him to take my by Auntie but he was in the cafe... and he said that he'd see.. (I still dont know if I dreamt this or not)... but I went back to sleep (if I even got up) .. and got up around 12 again... and ... STAYED UP ALL NIGHT!.. talking to Rene and Clayton.. Rene and I are BIG BLACK MEN with ENORMOUS piggies.. cuz we stayed up till 7:30!!.. and then I slept.. till... bout quarter past 1... ate... called dad again.. n asked him to take me somewhereeeeeee cuz I'm fed up of staying home... Sandy's leaving... sometime this week.. hmm.. I was supposed to go to the pool today but 1) I got up late 2) Mom was out all morning fixing something with the car n when she got back she was really tired.. So no pool this week... Last night I looked at this movie.. Khel.. it was actually really good... cept one thing that pissed me off was.. during every fight scene.. there HAD to be a pane of glass to throw someone through... even during the engagement ceremony thing.. there were pieces of coloured glass... that people were thrown through... I still love my indian movies though.... hehe.. Ok I'm off... curry duck calls...    Caeca Invidia Est..  Envy is blind...
