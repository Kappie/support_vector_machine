Leeds went through hell last season - bad debts, relagation, lost of their best players. Hopefully, they can pick up the broken pieces of last season and bring leeds back to glory days in time to come. And then maybe   alan smith   will go back to leeds :)!  Went to the opening of my cousin's hair salon today. Nice design he has for the shop, very zen! So got to catch up with my cousins today during the opening. Being in such a big family, its hard to talk to all my relatives.. so gatherings are always very good time to catch up! So, because of this, i missed going out to sentosa with my ti tu tiu friends (ac camp ppl). But i guess, you cant have the best of   both   worlds!
