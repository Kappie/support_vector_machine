Granted I was sitting on the couch in front of the TV watching VH1 while doing it so that probably was a little distracting. I am really embarassed about some of the CDs I own and hope they never ever see the light of day again. Why did I ever waste my money on that crap? I mean, LFO, come on was that worth 15 bucks? Destiny's Child? In retrospect, I don't think so.  I was hoping to have the house all to myself this weekend due to my step-brother's soccer tournament in Steamboat. But, I guess it was decided that nobody else is going withmy step-momand Cam. I could have used a little alone time. Just me and the dogs. Oh well. I really like my alone time. And I never get any of it other than when I am driving in my car to wherever. Sometimes I would much rather spend time with myself than with other people. Does that make me anti-social? I don't think so because I really do like talking with my friends it's just I am not the type of person who absolutely has to have their friends around at all times. Does that make me a loner? Maybe, but thats ok. I have the best friend anyone could ever ask for and some other pretty good friends too. That's all I need.
