So that's why I started this bloc; to have something to do when I'm so bored committing suicide seems like a good idea. Not that anyone will really ever read this. Unless, I tell my few friends about it, which I won't. I don't really tell my friends anything. I used to tell my close friends everything. Now I don't think of any of my friends as close. Maybe MJ, but she's in Ohio now. So even she feels far away. I wish she didn't move. Then again there's a lot of things I wish...
