Bay wants to break up with joe, shes like a mini katie when it comes to liking other guys when they give her attention. she tells me shes gonna piss joe off so he breaks up with her so she doesnt have to look like the bad guy once more. Joe wont break up with that girl..shes the love of his life hes always wanted. So..bay shows him conversations she had with some other guy about how they're gonna get together and "fuck". joe gets mad, and goes to this guys house, the guys in his car and speeds off, so joe follows him. they have a little talk. he tells joe that bay told him to say that kinda stuff. joe calls him a liar..i have to tell joe that brandon (the guy) didnt lie, he was right, bay did say all of that stuff. joe is heart broken and im sittin here crying for him. why am i crying? he said some very hurtful things.  He told me that he was tired of this kind of rejection and how he was never good enough, and how no one needed him. it broke my heart..he then told me he was going to kill himself. and how if he didnt come back from WV i shouldnt blame myself. he said "goodbye jules" and i begged him not to leave me worrying. he told me not to worry. he mentioned a letter he wrote to bay last nite. i begged him to please think things through and understand that its not the end of the world. he said "i'll find a way to end up in heaven, i hope i see you there" and then he said goodbye. just like that..and got offline. how can he do something like that to me?! how can he even talk like that? god..i hope he doesnt do anything stupid. please keep him safe. he just got back online. no one can understand how thankful i am right now that he just got back on. He keeps telling me his life is over and that hes tired of being hurt. i told him he was scaring me and how i was crying and wish he would just understand that it wasnt the end of the world. God..hes telling me right now how he wants to die and its the end of his world. and how hes leaving for WV in like 15min..i have 15min..to make him promise he wont do anything stupid. and does he promise? no..he says no he cant promise me. this is the worest feeling in the world. to have someone u love and care about go through this. Heartbreak breaks everyone.  JosiahBaker : but i cant take this JosiahBaker : i have to get away JosiahBaker : i have to get away from this life ~*Julesies*~: but not forever JosiahBaker : from this hell i live in.. ~*Julesies*~: u can go to WV and have a break ~*Julesies*~: and then come back ~*Julesies*~: and i'll be here waiting for u so i can pop up and say "hey u!!!" ~*Julesies*~: and then when u tell me brb i can say "yay!" when u come back to me ~*Julesies*~: when u come back home i'll be waiting just so i can say "yay! JosiahBaker : ill try to make it JosiahBaker : but i jsut dont think i can JosiahBaker : maybe this nightmare will finally be over ~*Julesies*~: please..please let me say "yay" just one more time when u come back to me ~*Julesies*~: it would be the best yay ever JosiahBaker : ok, one time  a few minutes later he's telling me goodbye before he leaves for WV.   JosiahBaker : well i have to go put evrything in the car JosiahBaker : ill talk to u if i get back JosiahBaker : pray for me JosiahBaker : call me sumtime at granny's in wV (304) 967-5285  i will call him..im afraid not to..he'll be gone until monday. i told him i'd be waiting and i loved him. and with that he told me "bye..."   Deep inside my heart i know that he wont go through with anything, the kid is too smart. but then my heart hurts because he feels this way, and theres always that chance he just might do something. i pray he doesnt. I'll prob call him saturday.   and thats been my day...  If i could, i would shrink myself, sink through ur skin to ur blood cells, remove whatever makes u hurt, but i am too weak to be ur cure...  *much love and hope*
