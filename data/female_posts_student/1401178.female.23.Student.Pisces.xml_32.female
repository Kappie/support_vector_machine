Portugal? Greece? I don't even know them. Oh gosh, this year's tournament been so kind to the underdogs.  The upperdogs mostly been eliminated, except for Portugal (they're the host, so they have the benefit of "host syndrome"). Italy and Germany didn't even make it out of the group phase. Italy was stopped by Duo Nordic, Sweden and Denmark. Italy's performance was...well, a little poor. They didn't live up to their reputation as the 'football nation'...the nation with the best football league. Italy did two in-a-row draw and a win, but to a bitter end. They were...stumped by the Duo Nordic draw performance. Germany also didn't live up to their reputation. But I can't blame them...they were at the hellish group with Czech Rep and Netherlands. The competition were stiff, and one of them got to go home early.  Moving on to the quarter finals, England was beaten by Portugal after a dramatic penalty shootout. England media and fans blamed the loss to the referee, the likely scapegoat, for giving the Portugal a penalty when the Brits are winning. Making the match end in a 2-2 draw, forcing the Brits to go into extra time. I also heard that some sportcaster has became so irritated that he crosses the journalism ethic (source: Forza Juventus mailing list). What a sore loser. Anyway, the next upperdogs that fell down the drain are France, who lost to Greece for a single goal. The coach claimed that exhaustion is the reason. Well, at least they don't point their finger to the referee (like some team). That would be the sooooo cliche.  Overall...it's been disappointing! I have lost interest since the first Italy's match. The poor performance and the spitting incident has left me cold...and yearning for my sleeping time. But since Euro only happens once in 4 years (thank god it's another four years from now), I kept on watching. And like I've predicted, it didn't fail to disappoint me. The upperdogs fell flat on their faces and the underdogs rules. But the salute goes to Greece, who has advance so far without any some sort of tricks (Well done, greeks!). The big award of unsportsmanship goes to the Duo Nordic, Denmark and Sweden. And the sore loser award goes to the Brits (Yes, it sucks to lose doesn't it?).  The final is approaching the end is near. But I already putting my nightcap on and my slippers off. I'm (so) ready to say "farewell Euro 2004, welcome World Cup 2006".   Disclaimer: Offended? Well, bugger off. I don't take nasty harassments. Decent comments are welcome though.
