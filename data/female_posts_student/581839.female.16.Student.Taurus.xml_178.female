HANSEN EMERGENCEY! it was like, chloe ran away or something, and everyone was crying, and there was a lot of screaming. i finished watching french kiss with my sister and my dad, great movie. last night, mary's friends came over shhhh just to see me, and we had a good time of playing trivial persuit ( i tied with bonnie! exciting!) then we watched the justin timberlake SNL, "bring it on down to omlettville" and we dressed up. earlier yesterday afternoon, we went to urban outfitters, but i didn't get anything. my mom got me a very lovely black skirt which wasn't cheap, and the exact shoes i was looking for. it was a great day. my dad left and i miss him, he's at a confrence. i have a lot to do coming up, but i will update i promise. fans, come back! PLEASE!
