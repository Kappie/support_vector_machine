Kevin has had lots of baseball lately with his regular season and his all-star team. Last weekend he had a tournament in Cedar Rapids. It was pretty fun. They lost, but it was still a fun weekend. Saturday night we went to ChuckE Cheese (Dad, Julie, Kevin, 4 other teammates, and me). On the way there, the boys talked about the 50-year old prostitute in Ft. Madison with a son named Elvis. I didn't realize how much you can learn from 12 year old boys. I won a slinky and some stickers. Sunday it rained in the middle of his game, so it was moved from noon to 4:00. We ended up staying up there an extra night with another family. I ended up watching The Simple Life with Kevin and his friend, Drew. Then, we went to The Olive Garden on Monday. Now, this weekend, Kevin has a tounament in Nauvoo. So much baseball.
