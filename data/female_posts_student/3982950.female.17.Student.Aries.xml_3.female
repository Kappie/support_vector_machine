As far as I know, this passage is meant to be taken quite literally. But is there some larger context that I'm missing? Can I simply ask for and receive $25,000+ for college tuition? Or is that a selfish request? Whatever you wish. I suppose if that's what it says,that's what I'll ask for.   I don't claim to be a greatscholar ortheologian by any means. However, I can read. I'm simply going to trust my God.
