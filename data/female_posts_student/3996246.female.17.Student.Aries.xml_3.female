I work so much that it's just nice to sit back and have nothing to doat all.I'm not used to this. I'm back to work tomorrow, 12-8, and I have no chance of getting off work early because Stephen decided to have a car show in the parking lot, yes....the A parking lot....he's calling it "Cruising the Dub."   What an idiot. It's going to be retardedly busy though.   I have 48 hours this week. I'm always scheduled for 5 shifts (40 hours), but I always end up getting suckered into picking up an extra shift for someone. I'm a 17 year old girl, I shouldn't be working this much and wasting my summer away but I'm working hard so I can save up my money for a car and random other things. [Dad and I have a deal that if I give him $1,000 he'll pay the rest to buy me a car]. This deal is way too easy, because I only have to pay a grand and he's paying the rest...I think he's getting jipped, I think he would pay for it all but I think he wants me to work towards something.   Anyway, hey...I got a 4 month old purebreadBeagle puppy the other day. She is the runt of the litter. She hada hair lip, and she had surgery and they fixed it now. Next month I have totake her in to get spayed, laser surgery on her nose so she can breathe better, and her cleft pallet fixed. She is the most loving, needy little puppy ever. Her name is Cookie.       Anyway, that's all...
