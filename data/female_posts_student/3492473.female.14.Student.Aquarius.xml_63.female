Now with my "friends" pretty much avoiding me, all I do is sit at home. Sunday's and Wednesday's are pretty much the only days I go out and that's only for soccer. I have no life. No one calls me. Not even to talk. It makes me miserable but I'm also cool with it. I finally have a break from all the things that were holding me back from my passion before. Writing. I hardly wrote when I was always out and it made me a hell of a lot crazier than I am now. Because now I can get my feelings out by writing a poem and before I had to cut myself... And that didn't even help too much.  I was just crazy enough to think it did.  It's a bitter sweet kinda feeling. Next, I'm not even going to camp this summer. Which really pisses me off. Because now I'm stuck in this damn town all fucking summer  with no escape  from my family or all my problems. That one week was always the highlight of my summer. And I don't even go on vacation til December. And even then, I'm with my family which doesn't make the greatest vacation. Oh and people from camp have to ask me "which one are you?" like they totally forgot about me. So that's really sweet. Arr...it's just so irritating going through this shit. Okay, I know I like giving advice and having people seem to need me. It's a nice feeling. But sometimes, I just get overwhelmed with it all. Like I'm suppose to be the one who solves their problems. As much as I would like to, I can't and I'm sorry.  I'm not God.  I just wish people would realize that.
