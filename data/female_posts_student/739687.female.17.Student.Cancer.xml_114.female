It's *tons of fun*. Only, that is a major negatory. Lots of pre-Thanksgiving cooking and cleaning going on. I like preparing for holidays. It's fun, and makes me happy. But the actual holidays themselves are much much more fun. Because it's fun minus the work. I wanna start Christmas shopping Friday, but I'm afraid my lack of money may hinder my plans a bit. Ah well, no worries. I always come through when it comes to my financial situations. Except when it comes to my damn Visa...majorly not goodness. Haha...but that's okay...I just hope they don't deactivate my card, which is what they're threatening to do. Sux0rs. Anyways, I'm in a talkative sort of mood today. I notice that everyone else's blogs and journals have such longer entries and they actually talk about stuff. I figure it's time I started doing that.  I've decided that I am going to lose all this weight I've gained. It's dumb on my part, however, they I've waited until the holiday season to make this decision. I'm gonna get back in kickboxing, because that got me in awesome shape right away. Corey, the instructor, works everyone really really hard, and at first you want to kill him, but when you realize that you're starting to tone up, you gain a great deal of respect for the man. He's so damn cool too! He was talking to me and Becka one day, and he was like "what you hafta do is party all through high school, and then settle down in college." Kinda ironic, because most people say otherwise. Maybe I should combine both sides of the advice, and just party through high school  and  college. Haha..ownage.  Okay, I think I've done enough rambling today. Au revoir you crazies.
