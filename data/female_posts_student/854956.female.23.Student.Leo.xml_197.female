Tomorrow should end up being a busy day.  Well, today is too... I get to do lots of laundry and work on a project that's due tomorrow for my science class.... oh YAY!  Naomi's bridal shower was lots of fun yesterday!  I enjoyed meeting her parents and her soon-to-be mom-in-law, Valerie.  We had a lot of fun.  I possibly will have some pictures to share eventually.  :-)
