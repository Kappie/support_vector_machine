Although I don't know why I am saying finally because the flight seemed to go by so fast.On the flight I was so excited about the take off I was disappointed because I couldn't help but fall asleep right before it happened. Was a bit sad. But I got to experience leaving Taipei.    I left Honolulu at about 8am on Sunday morning and arrived 15 hours later in Bangkok at 4:15Monday afternoon. I walked out of the Airport and was invited to take a taxi for 650 Baht or $16.50. I knew that was an outrageousprice so I politely declined. Then I saw that therewas an airport bus. Ihad a feeling that it was going to be over priced also but I thought that the workers wouldknow about how to catch a regular bus. So she told me to walk down the road to the bus stop outside of the airport and catch a #95 bus to Bangkapi (astreet) then catch another bus to Ramkhamheang.Where the Good NewsStudyCenter is. That is what I did and itseemed that it took longer to make this journey than it was to fly here. It wasn't really that bad.    I had emailed Kelly, the missionary here, a few weeks ago when I knew that I wasgoing to be coming and asked if I was going to be able to stayat the base. Ionly got one email backsaying that they had changedthe dorms into class rooms and that there might not be room for me there. I was not sure about what was going to happen so I was prepared for anything.    I showed up at the world base and they had no idea I was coming. I was not surprised. It was ok though. I feel bad, I feel like Iam putting them out. Tomorrow I will go pick up Liz at the airport and talk to Kelly and see where we will be staying. It would be nice if we can stay at the base butwemight not be able to. God will provide for me and I know that is true.    I wasn't very excited the whole way here. It didn't seem very real to me. Then it hit me whenI walked out of the airport and felt the warm humidity (which wasn't as bad as I was expecting or remembering it to be) I couldn't help but start laughing. It was a great feeling.
