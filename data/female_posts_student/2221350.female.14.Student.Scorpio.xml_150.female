I can't help but feel as though it's Christmas morning as I frolic into the office to make my triumphant return to the super highway. I think I've definitely had my fill of the outside world.  Saturday-I get to sleep at 5am, get up at 8am, go to longview and chill with my big sister, Kelsey, who has lost a TON of weight and is doing wonderfully. Went to a "party" with Kelsey and Devon which was actually a whole bunch of lame Mormon "20 somethings" getting together to talk about Mormon life, dating, church, and so on. Most of kelsey's friends didn't even say hello to Devon and I, and basically blew me off when I went out on a limb and said "hey, I'm caitlin" to a couple of them. Devon and I spent most of the evening sulking and talking and drinking((fruit punch... Gotcha)). Finally at around ummm 11 a couple of guys came over((quincy and tony)) ((Kelsey has a crush on quincy)) and we played cards and had a good chat. It was refreshing to find SOMEBODY who wasn't SO in denial of the fact that they were, in essence, just dumb teenagers with ID's that they couldn't lower themselves to talk to me, the "little sister". Got home around 3am, so tired.  Sunday-didn't sleep enough, arrived in Tyler around noon. mompat is doing well, and so are Daddy and Roseanne. Roseanne is the lady who lives with mompat and takes care of her and also HAS BEEN DATING MY FATHER FOR A YEAR. I was shocked, to say the least, when daddio finally told me. Dad also told me that she had "traveled Europe, modeled, seen all the museums, and was really nice". Feeling quite bristly, I made it a point to ask tons of art questions, mention tons of names and pieces, essentially out-arting her. I felt bad afterwards, as it was obvious she was intimidated. Although I try not to be intentionally mean most of the time, I couldn't help it when she started blathering about allll the museums and things she had seen and how her family owned a bunch of crap and yahta yahta why don't you quit bragging. As I erringly described da vinci's "Vitruvian Man" and argued the location of "The Thinker" ((it's in new york)), I was thinking to myself "yeah, you CAN appreciate fine art via the internet."   I suppose now that it's all said and done, she is a nice lady and absolutely nothing like my dad's last girlfriend/wife, who was an uber bitch and will be about %10 of my therapy bill. It's only natural for me to be highly critical when it comes to his girlfriends these days, and I was over it by the next day.  that night we had steak and my uncle mark, aunt Jody, and baby cousin Tommy((the one from the picture in my other post)) came over. We had a nice time and Tommy is ADORABLE as toddlers tend to be. His favorite word is dirt, which, coupled with his baby babble "accent", sounds much like "duht".  finally piled into the car and drove and found some fireworks. I'm not sure what was more explosive, however, the pyrotechnics or mompat's frantic bitching about traffic and how if we didn't leave RIGHT THEN we would be stuck forever.  Monday-wake up late and go to kelsey's grandparent's house, who are my half-grandparents and I love them dearly. We have a nice time and eat a lot and play dominoes.   Monday night was the pinnacle of my trip and the most fun I've had in a good long while. We went to quincy's house((where he lives, along with his ENTIRE family)) ((I think it's a Mormon thing)) and we had a rousing game of FIREBALL! Fireball is awesome. The concept is this: you take a rock, wrap it in cotton yarn, soak it overnight in kerosene, light it on fire, and toss it around a circle of friends. I loved every minute, and I hope I get to do it again soon.  Tuesday-sat around and did nothing until 10pm, when I saw "The Terminal" and, as I expected, it was fabulous.  Wednesday-finally came home.
