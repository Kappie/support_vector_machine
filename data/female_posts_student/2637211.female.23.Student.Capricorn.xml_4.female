I've read the earlier books of Left Behind (I was a little Christian during my teenage years), and all of Harry Potter, and I can honestly say that Harry Potter's better. They're just less cheesy, more originial books. Left Behind reminds me of Michael Crichton for Christians: very mass produced, very "action packed" yet not nearly as satisfying as a good old Harry Potter book.
