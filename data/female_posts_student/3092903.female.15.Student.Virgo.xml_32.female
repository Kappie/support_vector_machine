I had this awesome plan, and I actually had the balls to do it, but by the time I did, it was TOO LATE! I had the perfect oppurtunity too. BULLSHIT! Oh well, I guess I'll save my frustration for the next time I have a scandalicious agenda..I saw the hottie AGAIN today..He is so so cute. And by that time I was super glad I hadnt gone through with the little vision I had earlier. It may have been the sun messing with my mind..not really, i'm actually still pissed I didnt get to do it, because it was a hott little rendevous. Me and Sara did go shopping at the mall. We got new panties at Victoria's Secret and new clothes from AE and New Marine. Everyone was up at the mall today. We saw a bunch of people in FYE. We talked to Tobi about her summer. Then we saw Trey and he told us about all he'd done since today was his 18th birthday. He's such a funny guy. We saw a lot of people that we hadnt seen in a  while  though, it was fun.  Well, my night tonight  almost  topped the day. I wish the people who tell me I shouldnt give my dad a hard time could have seen the little fit he threw tonight. I cant even explain it, and I dont want to. (if you want me to tell you about it, you can ask me, I just dont feel like going on forever.) It happens every once and a while and the man goes absolutely psycho. I just dont know whats been up lately. I have been playing this little card game for so long waiting for a good hand, and all i ever get dealt are the bad cards..
