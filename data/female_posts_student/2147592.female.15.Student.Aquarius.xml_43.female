This morning, I didn't appreciate anything that was put infront of me, but I've just read my friend's (well I think he is, Leon) blog and I've realised how important family actually are. I don't know the case with other people, but I know thatm if I ever fall back my parents will always be there to catch me. I mean come on, this year they gave me a pair of pointy blue shoes  urlLink    and a video camera for fuck sake! They know I love recording and they have only done what I have reflected off myself. Well I'm sorry to all the people who I make them feel bad (that do't make sense, but you know what I mean!) and I want to thank all the people who has made me feel bad, it's like Christina Aguilera's song, fighter. Well I've found this amazing song, so, as usual, I must share!!!   GOO GOO DOLLS    "Here Is Gone"   You and I got somethin But it's all and then it's nuthin to me, yeah And I got my defenses When it comes through your intentions for me, yeah  And we wake up in the breakdown With the things we never thought we could be, yeah  I'm not the one who broke you I'm not the one you should fear We got to move you darlin I thought I lost you somewhere But you were never really ever there at all  And I want to get free Talk to me I can feel you falling And I wanted to be All you need Somehow here is gone  I am no solution To the sound of this pollution in me, yeah And I was not the answer So forget you ever thought it was me, yeah  I'm not the one who broke you I'm not the one you should fear We got to move you darlin I thought I lost you somewhere But you were never really ever there at all  And I want to get free Talk to me I can feel you falling And I wanted to be All you need Somehow here is gone  And I dont need the fallout Of all the past that's in between us And I'm not holding on And all your lies weren't enough to keep me here  And I want to get free Talk to me I can feel you falling And I wanted to be All you need Somehow here is gone  And I want to get free Talk to me I can feel you falling  I know it's out there I know it's out there And I can feel you falling  I know it's out there I know it's out there Somehow here is gone, yeah  I know it's out there I know it's out there Somehow here is gone, yeah  hehe! It's on the album Tabby gave to me. Also I love this song...  GOO GOO DOLLS    It's Over  And I didn't think about All the ways I hurt you and myself And I hide Wouldn't say a thing to you I keep it to myself and my mind I can't stand without you And I won't find the answers when you're gone  But it's over to you And I can't find the answers when you're gone And it's over to you And you can't find the answer where you are  And you know (And you know) I need you now This ain't easy to admit And no one needs to know What goes on behind the door in my room I'm peeking through the walls in my mind And I can't stand without you I won't find the answers when you're gone  But it's over to you And I can't find the answers when you're gone And it's over to you And you can't find the answers where you are  I will tear you down I will tear you down To get into the world you wanted I'm kicking through the wall No one can believe in things that never change  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::  And it's over to you And I can't find the answers when you're gone And I can't find the answers when you're gone And I can't find the answers when you're gone  WOW!!! On the site I get it from you can get the music! I'm so gonna get it then play it on what ever instrument!!!   I also like this one, sorry but I really wanna share my life with you all!  urlLink    hehe! Again... think of Little Moe's grunt... Oh Dear! Eastenders is on in a minute, will Kat marry Alfie???  urlLink   ... not quite, anyway... song...  GOO GOO DOLLS    Big Machine  Ecstacy is all you need Living in the big machine now Oh, you're so vain Now your world is way too fast Nothin's real and nothing lasts And I'm aware  I'm in love but you don't care Turn your anger into lust I'm still here, but you don't trust at all And I'll be waiting  Love and sex and loneliness  Take what's yours and leave the rest So I'll survive God, it's good to be alive  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com:: And I'm torn in pieces  I'm lyin there waiting for My heart is reeling I'm blind and waiting for you  Silly love with all your sins Wait and stop and I begin And I'll - I'll be waitin' Livin' like a house on fire What you fear is your desire It's hard to deal I still love the way you feel  Now this angry little girl Drownin in this petty world And I'm who you run to Swallow all your bitter pills That's what makes you beautiful You're all a lie I won't leave what you ain't got  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::  I'm blind and waiting for you I'm blind and waiting for you  And I can't believe it's coming true God, it's good to be alive I'm still here and waitin' for you And I can't believe it's coming true I'm blind and waiting for you  You really need to hear his voice though to really admire the song. Well I'll be back soon Love Y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  urlLink     urlLink    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx It's ok...
