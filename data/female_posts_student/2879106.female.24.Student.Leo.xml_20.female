I am like uhhhh yeah. So she said that she was planning a trip to Mexico with Alisha and I had to come too. I was still like uhhhh yeah. Right whatever. So we sat down at the computer with Alisha on AIM and discussed everything while checking driving times and prices. I think we have now decided to go to New Orleans instead. I mean hell Mexico would be cool but come on it's LIKE New Orleans (Oh My God!). We should be going on Christmas break which gives us six months to plan. I am getting very excited about this and I think it's going to be great. Just too bad we didn't think of this six months ago because we could be there already. Anyway I will keep you posted as I know more.
