Mistrustfully reserved natives are observing the spanking foreign ships which landed in the silent bay of the natives´ southern paradise. The strangely bright skinned invaders didn´t augur well. Captain Cook, who was to return from the southern ice pack border to New Zealand during his second worldtrip, leaned at the concretive railing of his "Resolution" with the flag of Great Britain and ordered to load the boats with gifts. The 7th September should become an unfortunate day for navigator and discoverer Cook as well as for two co-travelling scientists. Towards evening the boats docked back, and the sailors delivered Captain Cook a silver  Toado , a mighty blowfish, as a gift of the natives. As it turned out later, it was a  Spheroides sceleratus  whose extreme poisonousness was well-known to the inhabitants of the island. Probably one man uttered doubts at the fish´s edibility. Cook however quickly brushed theworries aside with the clue that he ate the same fish in Australia without any harm and that he tasted good.  Prepared in the right way, this fish is in deed a true palatal pleasure that lets the hearts of gourmets beat faster just at the sight of the fish. But the cook, who was more accustomed to the preparation of native herrings, obviously didn´t know about that because he calculated served the men liver and ovarion of the blowfish, that is his organs containing aside from the residual intestines and the gonads the heaviest fish toxin in general,  Tetrotodoxin  (TTX). Each of the three men received just a small amount, a sample quasi....  It started harmless. A creep on the lips, after a few minutes also at the fingers and several toes. Hours later the men laid down, far gone. Feelings of numbness on the whole body, incorporated with a feeling of floatation, martyring pains in the chest, frightening muscle infirmity that soon crossed over into paralysises of arms and legs. The men survived, rather due to a good whimsy of mother nature, since a blowfish contamination ends lethally with aprobability of 60%. A pig that ate from the residual intestines was found dead the next day.  Equally John Buff who stood on the "Duck River Bridge" (Parramatta near Sydney) in the afternoon of the 18th April 1821 and watched at the peaceful picture of a sunday fisher. He fried the caught blowfishs on a grill. The meal shoudln´t do him well. The report of the physician and mortician showed the following: 10 minutes after the meal he felt a numb feeling allaround his body. His tongue swelled and he complained about being really thirsty. Weak and strenghtless he laid himselfon the floor. After he had drunken some water, he asked, paralysized on his arms and legs, to be turned onto the other side. This was John Buff´s last request before his good soul disappeared into eternity.  From the first morsel up to his death only 20 minutes had passed by. Blowfish contaminations were feared even in ancient times. In the grave of Pharao Ti, 2700 BC, there was the picture of a  Tetraodeon stellatus , which was named "spt" or "shepet" by the old Egypts. This means baneful or toxic. Also the OldTestament offers us a clue: "That´s it what you may eat of all that lives in the sea. Everything which has flappers and scales, you may eat. But what has no flappers and scales, you must not eat, it should be considered impure to you.  - Deuteronomium 14, 9-10. Blowfishs have a skin that feels tender and sleek, with just tiny scales and abortive flappers.The fish appeared to the Olds as scaleless.  Blowfishs live in the tropes and subtropics. Only a few of them dare to enter the temperate zones. Some also succeeded in adapting to the freshwater, and they live in rivers now. Even the Mediterrean Sea knows a blowfish type, which is calledTetraodeon fineatus and whose poisonousness is unavowed. About 50 of the 1000 living sorts are known as toxical. Contaminations happen all around the world, but in Japan they are most frequent. There they are considered to be a delicacy for centuries. The Japanese call it "fugu" and their mouth waters when thinking of this tickling meal.   Who survives has to pay the devil.   Relishing Fugu is like Russian Roulettes: You never know whether the served fish is really nontoxic. The following numberscan demonstrate this forcefully: In the years 1956 to 1958 there were 715 contaminations in Japan, thereof 420 with lethaloutgoing. Which is 60% thus. This rate is nearly typical for blowfish contaminations. In the course of the last years this percentage has declined clearly however as well as the total number of contaminations.This is not due to the sudden fear of the Japanese but to the whole opposite. It is rather the government that restricts the preparation of Fugu to licensed cooks. They learn in courses how to flay the very sinewed skin, which contains toxin sometimes, in the most considerate way. Then, how the toxical organs look (ovarians or testicles, liver, gallbladder and gut) and how to remove without the slightest infraction. For instance, when you cut off the gallbladder, then the TTX canseep into the flesh and cause contaminations.  An American professor who held lectures at the University of Tokyo for a long time explained to me after a dive in the Caribbean (we just discovered a blowfish) with lighting eyes: "You know, it is the toxin that providesthe condiment, it gives you every palatal pleasure that no steak in the world can offer you."  And in deed, in Japan the most contaminations are reported in midwinter, thus before the fishs´ spawn periode which startsin spring. Before spawning there is a higher gonad activity (increased hormone production) leading to a higher production of TTX which then is stored in the named organs and eggs. After spawning (summer, fall) the fish has lost a large amount of his poisonousness. The flesh is stale (like the flesh of the nontoxic blowfish types) and spares itsspecialty.   Tetrotodoxin - heavier than Strychnin  TTX is the heaviest protein-free toxin at all. The lethal dosis for a 20 gramm weighing mouse lies at about 16 micro grammand for an adult man at about 1-2 milligramm. TTX is a nervous toxin. It blocks the nerve conduction by impeding the transport of sodium ions through the cell membrane. Further on it reduces the sensitivity of the skeleton musculature as well as the contraction ability of the heart.   Typical is the fast start of the symptoms after 5-30 minutes.  Slight contamination:- infirmity- dizziness- formication in face and on limbs- frequent queasyness, rare emesis  Mid-heavy contamination:- feeling of numbness all around the body with a feeling of floatation- the heart muscle is seized with a weak, fast pulse and decrease of blood pressure  Heavy contamination:- respiration disorders- becoming blue- chest aches - paralysises of limbs, laryngeal muscles and outer ocular muscles with grotesque strabismus  Death mostly occurs after 6-24 hours through respiration paralysis, casually after some minutes after heart paralysis. Who is able to survive the first 24 hours can expect complete cure. TTX was also introduced in modern medicine. Aside from Morphine it is used antispasmodic in the process of cancer therapies.   The toxic ball  When I started with the memorandum of this chapter one thing was certain: TTX is THE toxic weapon of blowfishs. Every reef bandit knows the danger that appears when consuming the fish and its spawn, and he avoides them assertively. But does he really know the lethal danger that is hidden in the fish? I affirm this concerning the spawn, but for the fish itself I am unsure. My worries are based on an illustrative experience:  Maledives, December 1975. I play with a little blowfish, barely larger than 20 cm. In his clumsy helplessness he looks a bit pathetic, and due to pure compassion I free the little guy back. At once he drains water and paddles with his abortive flappers into the protecting reef. Then he suddenly has a fit of nerves, and with desperate effort he struggles through the sparse amount of spare water. Because behind my back a group of  red snappers  greedily runs across the reef. Suddenly one of these robbers strikes in a flash with a forceful flap stroke. But my little friend had realised the danger long ago and had inflated back. Still he isn´t perfectly round, when the baring teeth of a snapper grab him. In vain, the sinewed, leathery skin of the blowfish proves to be an effective protection. A second attack fully fails. The teeth coudln´t capture the plump fish anymore. I can´t remember any longer whether this was a toxical blowfish. Anyway, I can´t imagine that a snapper could differa toxical from a nontoxic blowfish. That´s why I got the hypothesis that TTX is just a "haphazard" waste product of themetabolism process. Haphazard?Does nature create such a heavy toxin really just haphazardly? The trace of this thought would shock my biological world view and I let it fall as a too heretical matter.But it doesn´t want to get out of my head completely. Because who if not random caused such entirely different types like the Costa Rica frog  Atepolus , the western american salamander  Taricha torosa , the moonfish  Mola mola  and the Grundel  Gobius criniger  to produce exactly the same toxin, Tetrotodoxin?  We should rather leave the exploration of this academical issue to the scientists or way better, to the philosophists.
