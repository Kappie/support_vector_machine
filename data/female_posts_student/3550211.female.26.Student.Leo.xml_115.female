Evidently,  The French woman who claimed last week she had been the victim of a vicious anti-Semitic attack admitted to police that she had made up the entire incident, and was detained for falsely reporting a crime.   The woman -- identified in the French press as Marie-Leonie L. -- said she had drawn the swastikas on her own stomach with the help of her boyfriend, according to police.   That is one seriously messed up girl.
