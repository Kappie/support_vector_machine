I don't understand it. He's just so sneaky. So good at pretending to be a nice guy, that he slips under the radar. Anyhoo, it made me want to puke, on her shoes. She was like "Oh we are going to go to this conference together, and then this one, and oh he wants to drive up to that one...(in  Milwakee )." I guess she lives like 2 houses down the street from him or something, which also freaks me out internally. That's a fucking long drive from Kansas. Argh. I have been doing pretty well with not thinking about him too much anymore. Until people bring him up in conversation. Or I have to see him. Bastard. I think it's better to be hateful towards ex's, because that way you hopefully never have to deal with them again. Scare them off, so they don't come traipsing back into your life at a later point. And that whole "lets be friends" crap, does not work. Trust me. And you will hate yourself for it. And what is with the whole they break up with you and then are jealous like hell whenever you talk to one of their species? I hate boys today. (except tattooboy...he's yummy)
