Batang, the youngest girl was jumping on him today a little, trying to get him to play with her. He still looks really young because his cheek pads aren't fully grown in yet. My advisor said thatsbecause he was housed with another male at the zoo in pittsburg, PA, which suppressed him hormonally since he was younger. Animals are so neat. I can think of a few humans that it wouldn't hurt if they were hormonally suppressed. Its bad that I lean to the animal right side so often. Like when the Gorrilla got out of the Dallas Zoo and I was angry at the people that provoked him so that he had to be put down. And Tarzan's tiger having to be shot. They said because he lunged at the people trying to capture him. He's a lion for chrissake, they lunge. What else would you expect, him to calmly sit while he is caged again for the rest of his life? People are so stupid, so much of the time. OHHH what was I going to do today? Data entry and junk for my research prof. and maybe look up some masters programs to apply to. I could seriously just quit now and go into wildlife rehab though. If only it paid well. I don't think it does at all. Too bad. I spent a little time with the hippos today as well. They are such sweeeeet girls. Big huge sweeet girls that could kill me in a single bite. I've heard they kill more people in Africa than cars. They are supposed to be related ancestrally to whales. This is my nature lesson day for my readers, sorry.
