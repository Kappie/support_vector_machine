I can't remember it well, but I see a pretty girl who is short, black hair, nice tan skin, and just REAL pretty ( she kinda looks bitchy too). Anyway, she tells me " What he thinks you don't know, will hurt you....But what you truly don't know, will agonize you." And then I see a picture of Steven and me laughing, and then a  quick flash and then I'm on the ground crying....just fully crying my eyes out. Then I hear a guy's voice "I'm Sorry, forgive me, please?" And I scream. It's not an answer, it's just like a LONG scream as if I'm in pain. Then I wake up. I dont remember anything else. I dont even know if it's about Steven. But I know I woke up around 3 or 4am and couldnt go back to sleep 'til later on. I didnt wake up today 'til 6:07 P.M. I dont know but I feel kinda down. Maybe my rags about to start. Oh well. Stupid teenage emotions.
