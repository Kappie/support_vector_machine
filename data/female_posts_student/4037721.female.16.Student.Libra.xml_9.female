It's not really work experience as I will be paid 100 quid for the 2 weeks, but I will be able to use it on my CV when I get my first job. But it clashes with when I get my GCSE results so I will have to give a letter with my signature to either Saya or my Mum to get them for me. I wont be doing anything really exciting but its paid work and my Dad says that the two women I will be working with are really nice so I'm not complianing. Bye for now.
