I’ve been battling through a lot of sacrifices that made my life even more challenging to live. God gave me so many reasons to continue and to love my life. He had taught me a lot from these life experiences. I’ve learned new wonderful yet very challenging things, which helped me to know myself better. God even gave me back one person I wish for. He gave me the chance to experience and learn the meaning of TRUE LOVE. I’ve learned to face reality, to express myself, to fight in what I believe in and to show my true feelings. “Denying my feelings and myself” were some of the things I’m tired of doing and promised to leave behind. Now I’m living my life with the saying.  “BE REAL AND BE YOURSELF!!!”  I’m simply enjoying this life and really excited to face more trials that could fortify to be a stronger person that I am. I’ll strive hard to be a survivor in this world. I’ll never give things up just easily. I’m happy with this life and promise to live with it!… But if u don’t want to believe all this stuffs I’m sayin’.. SO BE IT!!!…Ü
