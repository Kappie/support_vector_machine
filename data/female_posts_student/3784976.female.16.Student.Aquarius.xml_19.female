My mom said it was okay since my brother, Ryan, and his wife never really pay any attention to me either! So I decided to go to Plymouth to K-Mart because I saw some sheets in their ad that looked cool. Guess what? They didn't have them at the store. Ugh... . So before I went my dad TOLD me that the next time, you know who calls, I have to answer and tell him 'no'. I was kind of mad, but my dad thinks that I should learn how to say 'no'. Ugh... again. Now that I have vented, I think I will go and do something a little more productive with my day.  Oh yeah, my doggy had to go and get her ears clipped today. Poor little thing :( I can't see her until tomorrow. She is going to look really funny! hehe!  And um Krystal, not Krystle, good luck tonight. You better call me and let me know EVERYTHING that happens!!! lylas!
