He is the one I had for my last surgery in October.  Anyway, she is very "Morphined - up"  and pooped.  Day by day... That is the only way to heal and get her strenght back.  Sitting in the waiting room, I realized how alone I was...  I basically was alone from 9am until 2pm when they wheeled her out...  Where are all the people that are suppose to be my friends and family... Don't get me wrong, I have lots of friends and these friends ( and family members ) have there own things going on, but when you need support, they basically are not around.  Makes me very sad to feel this way... I can't beging to express my sadness..    urlLink  ~ Sue ~  thank you for your good wishes...  It means a lot to me...  Got to go ,  have a great weekend.  I am off for a while, I have had it... Be Good
