The problem I am running into is that I do not get paid untill Friday. I have an idea of what I would like to do, but alas I can not make it happen for three days following the event. Alot like Christmas. I did not end up having the money to ge this presents until the day after Christmas. Such a winner I am. Really.  I am very excited about that pay check actually. I have two holidays and two days of overtime that will be counted in the hours. should work out to be about an extra $200 bones or so. Just in time for my birthday plan...Muah Ha Ha. I was never really good at being evil. Oh well.  It is a relief that the holidays are over. Now I can focus on work and the show. The show is going really well. We ran through all of Act I on Friday and we are running through Act II this afternoon. I have yet to get into my actual Stage Manager mode. I have not been to as many rehearsals as I should have been, and it is still going to be an issue getting to the Sunday rehearsals. I will have to leave early from work so I will have to see what Pete thinks about that.
