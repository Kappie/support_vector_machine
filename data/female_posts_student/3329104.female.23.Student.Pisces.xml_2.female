I don't really have much of a life right now.  I am way too overloaded with classes and my student teaching to even grab a beer every now and then.  Hopefully that will change this summer!  I don't work so I am living off my GI Bill.  Yeah I spent four long years in the Air Force.  It really wasn't that bad.  Hindsight is 20/20 right?  I wouldn't have traded it though.  I needed the military to show me that I better get an education or I may be stuck here forever!!!  :-)  I am studying to be an elementary school teacher.  I like kids...I think.  I am actually going to be a chaperone for a 4th grade sleep away camp tomorrow and Friday.  We'll see if I still want to teach after this weekend!    Talya
