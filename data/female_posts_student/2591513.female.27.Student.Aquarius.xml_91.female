I remember feeling the grief and being just completely overcome.  I haven't heard from my dad since Mother's Day and maybe that is why it has weighed down on me.  My dad by no means is a perfect man, buthe does love us in his own way and life isn't so black and white.  I don't know.  I know he has his faults and his shortcomings, but it does not take away from the love he has always had for each of us.  I think that sometimesdwelling on the hurt blinds us to the love...but don't get me wrong I know why we hurt.  Anyway, I can't imagine my dad being gone.  I think because for most my life he has always been a very important figure in my life.  I can't imagine him gone from it, even though I see him maybe once a year the past few years.  Oh well.  I guess it is just one of those mysteries in life that I was not meant to understand.  I dont' know.  It dawned on me though that my Bailey is will 7 this year.  OMG!  Where the hell did the time go?  Nalani will be 4...what 4?  That can't be right.  lol  If you see her, you will know what I mean.  I am so old and my children are growing.  Oh do I love those monsters of mine.  I was reading a friend's blog and she reminded me of the first times I saw Bailey, Nalani and Emily.  The first peek in my tummy.  Those are etched in my mind, heart and soul.  I ahve poems on  urlLink    Search for Lanie Dikitanan and you can read them.  My favorite is the one about Bailey.  You can be the judge though.  Check them out.  Anyway, I should rest, my body is not feeling well again.
