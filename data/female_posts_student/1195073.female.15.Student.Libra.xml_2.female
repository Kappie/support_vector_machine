CUPID'S STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ok, i will just go to bed and dream about the hotties.....  if you don't know who they are by now, look at february 11th's post.  also, check out the website madblast.com and play the michael jackson baby drop game.  it's hilarious!!!!!  i won't do the things that made my day and things that made my day shitty thing today.  just look at yesterday's post.  they're the same.  except for the 'cry me a river' thing.  that song wasn't in my head today.  ARE YOU HAPPY COURTNEY?!?!?!?!?!  quote of the day: "There's a new medical crisis. Doctors are reporting that many men are having allergic reactions to latex condoms. They say they cause severe swelling. So what's the problem?"  --Dustin Hoffman
