Then at like 10:30 Tregory came over. :) I was looking at him, like I always do, but I noticed he looks alot like Usher. Or Usher looks alot like him. LOL, I wonder if he has the body of Usher?...Something we'll have to find out later.  ANYWAYS  then after he left I went to Fred's, and um...then slept from 5 to 6. After supper slept until 8. I'm still tired. *Yawn* Oh, Tregory didn't bring his dog over here, because he couldn't get one cause his little brothe got the last one. :( And I wanted to name it. PooP. Well Sharla called today, it's her last day, she is moving to Arkansas. :( I'm so bored. Well um...later.      I love Tregory 4 Ever N Always
