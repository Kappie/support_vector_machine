I was like No...its only 12!!  So I wok eup and ate some pizza. Then like 15 minutes later our POWER WENT OUT! So, being me, I freaked. "WHAT NOT TO WEAR MARATHON STARTS IN 2 HOURS!! I can't watch it if the power is out!"  So then my brother was all like "Your not a very good christian if all you care about is tv!!" So I was like "Right...."  So then we deiceded to go watch my brother and his best friend, Kyle, surf in the ocean. One problem, we had no clue where they were surfing at...so we drove around EVERY stinkin' where for like 2 hours trying to find them btu we couldn't. We got out at a few beached but considering we were in the middle of a stormy strom I went out then ran back to the car. Everyone else in my family was SOAKED!  Then we went home and it started to get dark, really dark. Our power was still out and we only had like 3 candle. I called Katie with my dads cellphone and we talked for a bit then I tried to read great expectations by candel light, an interesting experience to say the least.    I felt kidna like Biddy...I don't want to maryy Joe!!  At about 6 we started to kinda worry about Jacob and Kyle...it was pitch dark and really stormy. I waspretty scared that they were lost at sea or something.  Finally, at like 6:30 they came home, then we drove to find some place to eat where they had power, we drove for about 30 minutes then finally found a taco bell to eat at.  It was kinda nasty :)  Then we went home and the power was still out.  To end this story fast because I am almost out of time at the library, the power went on at about 10 P.M. and I got to watch the final 2 episodes of what not to wear.  :D  I love you guys!!
