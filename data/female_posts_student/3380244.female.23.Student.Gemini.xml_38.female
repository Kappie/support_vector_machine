(i sound like that chick in america's sweethearts)  so dating has been very nice because i'm finally being pursued, cared about, respected, and taken care of.  it feels SO nice.  though, it's tough because there is more than one and they both call SO often.  gosh, i feel like such a tool complaining about something like this, but it's the truth... i just feel pulled in too many directions.  from these guys, from friends and from family- i want to scream "IT'S MY LIFE!"  anywho... i feel better now that i vented.  things with alan... i'll try my best to keep this short and sweet.  first of all, elaine visited on a tuesday (alan's x-girlfriend/my good friend) and it was SO WONDERFUL to see her and spend time with her.  at night we layed in my bed for hours talking about alan.  since we've both been through the "alan breakup" we have a lot in common and a lot to talk about.  we laughed and cried and eventually fell asleep.  was really good for me to have her here and to prepare me for alan's visit, which was the following day.  alan arrived on a wednesday and it was really nice to see him.  when i first saw him i hugged him and it honestly felt like home.  so good to see him again.  the 1st part of the trip was blissful, he's changed... grown up a lot since our breakup.  and he was super sweet and caring with me- it felt so nice to have that come from him.  but then came the middle of the trip (he flew to NY because he was the best man in a friend's wedding) when we were in rome, ny for the wedding... and things got emotional.  in one of our many car rides i suddenly burst into tears that would not stop flying out of my eyes!  i felt so confused, sad, hurt, annoyed, and alone.  the following 24 hours were difficult... i was crying most of them, along with fighting with alan.  this was the relationship with alan that i was used to (unfortunately)... the fighting and crying were all too familiar.  i'm not saying that's all my relationship with alan was, because i love alan and we had many, many, many absolutely wonderful times.  but towards the end of our relationship when we lived in different states, the crying and fighting were more frequent than i would have wished for.  :(  though, we did end on a good note... i realize that alan is an absolutely wonderful person and i still care about him very deeply.  but alan and i are not meant to be together as a couple- that is very clear to me.  and on an unrelated (to alan) note... the wedding was a BLAST!  i got to hang out with lots of his friends from high school again and i had a fabulous time.  they are some great folks and we partied like rockstars aaaaaaaaaaaaaaall weekend.    look for new pics,  urlLink
