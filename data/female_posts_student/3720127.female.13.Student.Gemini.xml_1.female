(hint: there was a bit of sarcasm there). Let's see, I woke up in the morning and got ready to go to school. We had a half day because it was the second to last day. School was normal. Everyone was crying there asses off because we were really going to miss the teachers, the work, homework, and the projects we have to do at the last minute because of our lazy bums. Yeah very normal. LOL! Had you for a second there, huh? Ok maybe not. But it really was normal. People were hanging out with friends, talking about pool parties, you know the whole deal. But after school was a different story. When the bell rang to signal the end of school, everyone went out in the pouring rain. We all waited for our rides, and eventually people left. But mine never got there. So I went back inside to call my mom but the phone was busy. I continued to call for at least 15 minutes but once again nothing. So I went back out to keep waiting. And guess, what my ride still didn't come. I waited for another 15 minutes but nothing. Then I realized that I probably looked like a dork standing in the rain getting soaked so I decided to start walking to my house (yes, in the rain). I passed 3 blocks when it hit me, my house was 1 mile away. I started to really kick myself that time. But i figureed there was no point in turning back so I kept walking. When I got home, my mom started to interrogate (such a big word) me like how i got there, why am i wet, and what was i doing the night of the 4th. Ok, maybe not that last bit but still. Yeah, she got pissed. Can you belive it?! I try calling her for 15 minutes straight to try to get a ride but she was on the phone talking to her friend and she gets pissed?! Oh well. Anyway other than that I had a stupid day. But I gotta go now. Bye. ~Prue~   June 23, 2004  Hello, again. Today was, well, heartbraking. It was the last day of school. The last day I will ever see Michael, the guy I liked for 2 years. He's moving. But that's not all. He likes a friend, Arriene. Of, course I can't blame him because basically every guy in school likes her. I mean all me and Michael ever was were good friends. We flirt a lot and we trust each other enough to tell each other our secrets but all we will ever be are friends. At least he gave me 2 hugs before he left. After school, I went to a pool party. But it wasnt much help to my sadness. Yeah I know I sound sooo emo but I really dont care. I had fun but when I thought about today and the last day of school and Michael, all the happiness was just swept away from me like a tidal wave that just suddenly crashed down on me. I also tried to become happy by going to my best friend house but just like the party, nothing, capische, nada. Guess I just care about him too much to forget. Well now I gotta go. Bye. ~Prue~   June 24, 2004  No more school. If it were any other year I would probably be very happy and start dancing like that guy from the Great Adventure commercial, but its not. I just can't stop thinking about him. Yesterday right before my sleep. I was thinking about him, and I cried. It wasn't the hysterical sobbing kind of cry, it was just silent tears streaming down my tanned face. (I should become a writer shouldn't I?) Anyway, I guess I'll just try to keep myself busy from thinking about him. I'm going to go now. I'm too sad to write more. Bye. ~Prue~   Whew. Well, how was that? That took a lot. But you know, I am really sad. Oh, well. I'll try to post tomorrow. Bye (for real this time). ~Prue~
