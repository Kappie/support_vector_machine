That's ok, I think I'll have to force myself to start brainstorming about the paper tonight and do away with the the drama.  Charlie had better wash my Cal sweatshirt. He wore it all day yesterday, and it probably didn't cover his navel except he had another shirt on. Hood on too, of course. Except he just notified me when he came to get the detergent that he'd sneezed on it...  Charlie and Jenn and Matt saw Clinton today, in the flesh, in Harvard Square. I wish I was there, but I was in class. Matt told Clinton to "go screw himself." Asshole. Bigot. I can't believe some of the things he says sometimes, and with nothing substantial to support his arguments. But I got a 90 on my midterm. I wonder if that's good or not...I hope it is. I found my blue book at the bottom of the pile...does he rank by performance in book order? At least it's an A. I can't complain. I should go over to Tozzer tomorrow to start researching topics, and then make an appointment with Prof Macdonald.  I'm not going to Wendy's. Charlie just called...and I figured I don't want to go.  Why does this paper seem so awfully unappealing?
