I will have to complete two projects by the 2nd. I am almost done one. Amanda emailed me and asked me if I wanted to come up to Edmundston with her. I would really love to but I have to stay home and get my projects done. I handed in my death and dying project already so that's done. It was an interesting project to do. Anyways I have to go and see my French professor and catch the bus. So I will catch you later! Have a great day!
