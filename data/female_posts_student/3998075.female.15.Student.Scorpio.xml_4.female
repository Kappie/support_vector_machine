I just wish i had a bestfriend to talk to. I realized something today....that i can get over my mom's death that it will just take more time....but i'm starting to move on....i do know that i will never forget her....she's on my mind everyday.....and i will never forget her EVER!! I will miss her always. Hopefully one day i will be able to see her again...and when that time comes she won't be in anymore pain...like she was for so many years..... I just can't wait untill that day comes when i can tell her how much i love her and how sorry i am for putting her thur so much shit.....I know that it wasn't Brittni who get thru to me...it was her....she would want me to be happy....to move on....but i can't help but think i can't be happy now that she's gone..like i shouldn't be! I don't know......i do know that i've taken one step toward moving on! I just wish that brittni and kyle would talk to me like they used to. Oh well at least i still have Sam and he's all that i need if they won't get over it! I will always keep my shit to myself from now on!! I miss you sam...you need to come back!!LoL.....i guess i'll write later!!
