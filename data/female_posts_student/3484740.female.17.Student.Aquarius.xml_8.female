But sometimes it would have to be better than the alternative. A month and a half ago I went to town with a guy, thinking possibly it was cool again...and it turned out he wasn't. Of course. I'm never right when I want to be. I guess I should start getting used to it.  Work has been okay lately, except the other day. The girl that works on Thursday, told me she couldn't get the vacuum to work, which wasn't a big deal. It didn't need it. Well, I couldn't get it to work Friday either, so I called my neighbor(he does the pool stuff) and asked him if he could come and try and make it work. He said he would be there around 4 or 5. Well it was about 4:30 and I decided I might want to get in the pool, well I got on my bathing suit and everything, and only got my feet in basically and decided that no, he was coming and I better not get in just yet, and it was freezing. Well, he came about that time and I had my pants about half way on when he came up. He was like, no don't do that, I can't see your body if you do that. And I sat down and had my shirt and was about to put it on and he got up to go to the gate to get started with the vacuuming, and told me to not even put on my shirt, which I did anyway. By that time I was really starting to feel weird. And so we went and got the stuff, and started. He got it to work and so I vacuumed then because it needed it. And he kept making comments like, I'd enjoy this more if you were in your bathing suit. And then there was something in the pool, it looked like spit to me, and he was like, it looks like someone came in the pool, you haven't been having sex in here? And oh my gosh!!! And he said something about my ex, how he drives a little green truck...that he saw him at WalMart and said he was a jerk. Well, according to him, the only thing he said was that we broke up because we didn't get along. How is that being a jerk? Thats exactly what happened. Maybe he did something else. And he said something else about how the sex is good but its not everything. And he said more than once about me needing to take off my clothes, like one time he said do you have a boyfriend yet? And I said no not yet, and he was like...oh well thats because you don't take off your clothes, you gotta show these guys everything you have.  I had no idea what to do. I still don't know what to do. I told my mom and dad, they came to the pool later and I was like, okay...I don't care if the house is burning down, but if Jim is here, so are you. And they asked why and I told them. Well dad said I should tell my boss, which I think I should too...and I had planned on it today, but she never came back. But mom said I should wait and see if he does it again. Well if he went that far the first time, why wouldn't he do it again? I don't actually think he would try anything, but I can't be sure. The neighbor, his mom(I think) said that there was a girl that had a complaint on him before because he said inappropiate things and wanted to have an affair, but she didn't believe it because it was like "love at first sight" with him and his wife. I told the lady who I work with, and her husband over heard, and he was like...well thank you for telling me, I thought I might like him but now I know I don't, and hes the kinda guy that...would do something, at least say something to him. Which he said he would the next time he sees him. I don't want to start anything with the neighbors, but that was going a little to far I think. I don't know, I don't know what to do...any ideas would be wonderful!!
