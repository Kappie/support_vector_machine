Then I was gonna fix my hair  put on my make-up  mom said there was no use in goin because it was late anyway.. So I didn't go. I was only gonna go to see "somebody" though.. But they wasn't there anyway.. So everything is good.  I finished watching "Miracle" today, It's a pretty good movie. It's all about hockey though.. Kinda boring.  Other than that, I've just been sittin around bein lazy  talkin on the phone. I haven't been on here a lot because it hasn't been workin for the most part of the day.. That made me mad but oh well..LoL!  I stayed on the phone with Adam till like 11:30 last night! So I was really tired this morning!  But anyway! I guess that's it...
