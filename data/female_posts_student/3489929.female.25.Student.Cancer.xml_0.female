I thought that my life would go exactly as I had always planned. I was going to finish college in three years (as I had already amassed enough credits in high school to finish by the time I was 20). Then I would move, victorious and complete in my own self-worth, to law school- preferably Ivy League- where I would be editor of the Law Review and graduate at the top of my class. Then I would be ensconced as a junior associate at a top private law firm making $75,000 a year by the time I was 25.  I turn 25 next month. I only finished two years of college- at two different schools- before I quit. I have spent the past five years working in an office and maintaining my job solely through my boss' inexplicable liking of me (because God knows, I've put him through hell). I have moved 16 times in five years because I cannot keep an apartment- or a roommate- to save my life. I have no savings and I have driven most of my friends away from my sheer hatred of myself. Those who have stuck around- I honestly don't know why. I feel unworthy of having anyone give a damn about me. I think about dying almost every day, because it makes me feel relieved to think I can escape from all of the misery in which I have ensconced myself.  It's time to make a move. I refuse to spend the rest of my life with barely enough money to live on. I refuse to live any longer beneath my potential. I refuse to give up on my life because there is still a lot I can do.  I'm smart, dammit. I'm better than this.  This is all contingent on student aid, but... I am moving back to Mississippi to go to the college at which I spent my disastrous freshman/sophomore year. Disastrous only because I was drunk (both literally and figuratively) with the idea of being away from my controlling, unrelenting parents. They had spent years hammering away at me, making me study when I wanted to play, eschewing any social life they perceived as damaging to their efforts to mold a daughter who would provide for them in their retirement. Well, not my mom so much. But my dad insisted that I live my life solely to go to college. I spent my childhood reading books. At my father's urging, I completed  Robinson Crusoe  at age 8,  Nicholas Nickleby  at age 10,  Gone With the Wind  at 11. Granted, I love to read, and that is due a lot to my father's influence. But maybe my life would have worked out differently if I had not been under such hellish pressure to succeed.  My father and I were close growing up. When I was a teenager, I hated my mother as much as I loved my father (there's a statement Freud would have a field day with). My daddy took my side over my mother numerous times, leading my mother to tell me regularly that I was going to cause them to divorce because they spent all their energy fighting over me. When I was a teenager, I found this funny. Now, I just find it sad.  In the back of my mind, I always knew my father's love for me was contingent solely upon my intelligence and the fact that I excelled at school and gave him fodder for the watercooler at work ("My daughter just made Honor Society." "My daughter got scholarships from all six of the schools she applied to." And so on). And that all changed in an instant when I veered off his preset path.   When I dropped out of school at age 20, I dropped off his radar. He never speaks to me. If I call the house to talk to my mother, he never says "Hello," or "How ya doing," or "Fuck you." It's just, "Hey, Daddy, it's me." "Oh. I'll get your mother." I think he literally hates me and doesn't even deign to put it into words. At holidays, I avoid him. Thank God there are only two "attendance required" holidays in my family, and they're only a month apart, so that gives me 10 months to avoid him.   As much as things have worsened with my father, they have improved with my mother. I love my mother. She listens to me and though she isn't always able to help me, she tries, which I more than I can say about my father. Mama is great. I regret I spent my teenage years hating her, because we could have been spending time together and I might have realized sooner what I have.  My mother knows of my plans to move to MS. She is under strict orders not to tell my father yet, but she did warn me that the minute I cross the state line, she is letting the cat out of the bag. I don't care. By then I'll be beyond his reach. And the first time he calls me to demand to know my grades (like he did  every single week  I was in MS before, I will bitch him out like I have been dying to do for years. This time, whether I succeed or fail, it's my own damn business.   Why did I decide to move back to MS? Couldn't I go to college here? Well, I could. But then I would still be around the crutches that I use every time I fall, and that's not good for me. I need to be someplace where it is all sink and swim, and it's all me out there on my own. For the first time in my life, I want to be completely self-sufficient.  I am setting myself up to fail spectacularly. This is why I am being extra careful in my planning. I have to make sure all of my little ducks are in a row before I screw myself over. First things first. I am moving to a place that is in the ghetto, but is much, much cheaper than where I have been living. I have to start saving if my plan is going to work. I'll be scared out of my mind, but as long as I have a bed to sleep in and a lock on my door (please, God, let there be a STURDY lock on the door), then I will be fine.  Step two is to either fix the car I have (problem with the fuel line) or get a new car. Do I trust old Silver, my '93 Mustang, to get me to MS and back three to four times a year? Before March, I would have said yes. Now, not so sure. I'll still chewing on this problem.  The rest of my plan is still being fleshed out, and I am getting anxious and trying to get this done before July, so I can start for the summer session. But I am trying to be patient and wait until fall. Here's why. The last time I "took a sabbatical" from my job (loooong story), I started back on July 14 of last year. Coming up this July 14, on my one-year anniversary, I will have one week's vacation. If I can wait that long, I can cash it in before I quit and have the extra money, plus whatever bonuses I earn between now and then. The problem is that I don't really want to quit my job. I want to work on my time off from school. I'll have the entire month of December and May through August off every year, and I will be spending them here in AL. I have to see if my boss is amenable to that, or even to letting me work comp in MS. My job is all by phone anyway. We'll have to see about that one. I'm not sure (in fact, I'm almost positive) he doesn't trust me enough to do that yet.  I finally feel optimistic and even hopeful for the first time in years. If this works out, I'm on my way. My worst enemy is myself. If I can conquer that, then I have nothing else to worry about.  To quote an old friend, "Life is study." Consider me a devoted student.
