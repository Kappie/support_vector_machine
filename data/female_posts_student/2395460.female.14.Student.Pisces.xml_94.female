I suppose it's not that easy, even for Oprah, but that all may change soon. Australian scientists are working on a "vanity drug" which would simulate the effects of execise by activating an enzyme that boosts metabolism. While the drug won't actually build muscle, it could potentially help you lose fat without dieting.  In a society that measures prosperity by seeing how  urlLink skinny  you can get without actually dying, what would happen if looking like Jennifer Aniston was the norm? Would beingout of shapein a world of SlimFastNanobecome chic?  Read about the skinny pill at  urlLink MSNBC .
