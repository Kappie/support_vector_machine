"Luther." ...yep, this is what i do with my life. i go see historical movies because were learning about that in school...even though i dont get extra credit...yeah...i dunno. i mostly went cause of all things we study...the reformation does kind of interest me. its about all i remember from world history, anyway. and i did think joseph fiennes was really good in Shakespeare in Love...and hey, i get to see Emily...which is reason enough in itself to do just about anything. and i feel better now... and that is good. and i was reminded that emily and i sort of still have our little secrets from everyone else... which i guess is not necessarily a good thing...but it is because...i dunno, because it is. hopefully i can get her to sleepover next weekend or the one after... depends when erics gonna want her... but it was decided that emily should be jasmine for halloween. and eric should be aladdin. and its funny...just because emily dressed up as jasmine is an amusing mental image. and...mm, im tired. i think im just gonna go. ill have to actually write something on this in a few days. cause now im starting to use it as a real blog which was never my intention. ill write a nice little passionate speech or something...eventually...maybe after i get back from the confirmation kick off class thing tomorrow. maybe ill be annoyed by the lack of piety among my classmates and ill be spurred to write...or something. who knows? but here...picture emily like this:
