I can't go into detail because well, it is rather long and something I would want to relive anyway.  I used to think change was good...and these days, it seems to be sad for me.  Maybe it is the fact that I hold on to my past and keep it close.  I guess it isn't always practical when you get older.  You know what I think is the the saddest phrase, "Growing apart."  I know it is something that happens a lot to many people.  I guess when it happens to you, you just aren't ready for it...especially when growing apart means letting go of a relationship.  NO I am not talking about Ed.  I don't think I would ever let things go that far...but it is with an old friend.  I understand, but also am still deeply saddened, besides no matter how much you may love and hate a person, it isn't easy admitting that the friendship only has a past and no present, and more than likely no immediate future...but that's life right?  Friends come and go?  But if they aren't just friends?  What if they were people you considered family?  Does that change the rules of growing apart?  It is funny as I say this, I am finding roads back to my friends from elementary school.  It is so nice to be able to chat with them.  I think when everything is well with me, I will set up a date to get together with them and see them.  I think it would be cool.  Although I am sure all of us have changed in so many ways.  My birthday plans may be put on hold only because there isn't a lot of money right now...unless I work with the cleaning people I know.  I just hate working with their chemicals and sticky stuff...and they give us the nastiest places sometimes...but I guess if I want to go out for my birthday right?  Also, Ed and I will celebrate nice years of being together...oh damn, has it been nine years already?  haha  Time flies when you are in love...and yes after 9 years I am STILL very much in love with Ed.  No matter how crazy he drives me.  So that is it...I would vent about my sister not wanting to hang out with me on my birthday, but what's new?  Nothing I guess.  Accept the things I cannot change...I need to learn that...Obviously a lesson I need to accept for this year...as I am now learning.
