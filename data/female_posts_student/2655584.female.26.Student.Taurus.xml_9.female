"i love your voice" how sweet... sure. 2.  "i think about you all day" umm....o..kay? 3.  "you're beautiful"  okay... whatever i can deal with that. 4.  "you've changed my life" another whatever... and yet kinda freaky. 5.  "i lurb you"  huh... what the fuck does that mean? 6.  "i love you"  oh shit... why does this always happen to me? 7.  "i want you here..." fuck... not another stalker! 8.  repeat number 3 and number 6 a lot. 9.  add more of number 4. 10.  top it all off with another number 7.  poor me.  i just dont know how this shit happens.  i dont know what i do.  i am chatting for gods sake.  yea, there is a few pictures of me... but still.  how can people go from so cool...to so... eerie.  what the fuck.  now what!
