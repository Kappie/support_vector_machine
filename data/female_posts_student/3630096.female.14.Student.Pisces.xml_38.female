But Life certainly doesn't seem bright enough to bring more confidence to myself. The week is going to be full of work, rememdials, tests! It's endless working! And he's coming back! Oh no  oh no  OH NO!! I really can't imagine a week filled with desperate thoughts. Coming right up was the napha test, which I am sure I am going to fail. Can I really pass? I might have passed my 2.4...but my standing board jump will drag all my efforts down. At least something can cheer me up! That is the existance of more band practices than usual. From monday to wednesday, this means more time taken up to be sacrificed to band practising, but this is also important! This is the future of our band. I really don't know what to do, with all the sec1s wanting to quit band. It started off with Xuehua first and then more and more people joined in the trend. Is it really that difficult in order to join band? My self do not have any talent in music at all. I haven't got the passion for music. But do I join band? I'm asking the same question over and over again, to different individuals. I remembered that very special day, which is supposed to be a thursday if I'm not wrong. It's only the second day of school... But I'm notified that there's going to be a band open house. What's a band? A group? Or something? Ever since I went there, alone, I had fallen deep in love with music. Music is great. Music is everything! I simply demand people to at least stay with music when their choice is there. But I really can't. It's not really much... yet I see them, one by one, walking out of the band room, never seen again. That time, I remembered Jaslyn asking me a question, "What if we didn't join band?" That means I'm going to be totally alone. But that's not the case, they are still there. Even though, we're not really close friends, at least someone is there... There's the rehersal today for ndp rehersal tomorrow, which is supposed to be very very important. It's the event where we can manage to get the school to regain the trust in us. It's just a small little hope. Nizam stepped out again to conduct with his charming smiles, which not a single girl can avoid. I remembered during recess time, Jaslyn asked yuhui to see Nizam, to see whether he is handsome or not. Yuhui shook her head firmly. Oh my god. He is so shuai!! I spoke in defend. haha. He is shuai wad!! hehe. He's not the type who will say yes to defeat easily. He gives a special force everytime he conducts...a very special force which none of the passed out student conductors can give... It was a really hopeful rehersal, only that I hope there's more people around..I really wished once people had decided to put band as an option, they will not quit so quickly. They HAD put it there, and they shall take the responsibility. Yet one by one, they walked off the stage... I really don't know what's happening. I only wished it can be a fruitful band practice everytime....
