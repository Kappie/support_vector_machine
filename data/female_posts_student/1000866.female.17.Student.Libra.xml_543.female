I've been pretty much reading on and off since then. This book is SO good. The Da Vinci Code. It's amazing. I really thought I'd be let down, like I was creating too high expectations but, I'm more impressed than I thought I'd be. It's difficult to put down.  YaY! Tonight I get to go out to dinner for my brother's birthday, which technically isn't until Thursday. I guess he's having a New Years party in his appartment downtown. Heh. Only New Years party I've heard of yet. Kind of odd...no one's having one... I'd go, but it's going to be a bunch of college guys and....hmmmmm, actually...maybe I'll go pay a visit. Heh.   And now...back to reading.
