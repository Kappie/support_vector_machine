In the past 10 days I: went to YLA, helped prepare a Seder, went to my first Seder at someone else's house, first overnight at the beach with friends, got sunburned, played Frisbee and volley ball, jumped in to the ultra cold ocean, got hollered at while on a balcony, joy rode the island with friends in the mustang, washed the inside and outside of my car, played with my neighbors, got a massage and facial, wore way way too much makeup at the mall, went out to lunch and a movie, ran across 5 lanes of traffic.  Its no wonder that I had to get up at the crack of dawn to finish up homework before school.  Why must we return to school?  But alas we must and luckily there are only 7 weeks remaining!
