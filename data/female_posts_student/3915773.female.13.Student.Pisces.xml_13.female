Currently, wine is legally defined as an alcoholic beverage in France, so the industry’s advertising is limited. The wine lobbyists in the country are arguing that the substance should be redefined as a food because it is “a substance with nutritive components absorbed by the digestive tube.” This will allow the industry to advertise on television and radio, and they will no longer be required to post warnings on their product about the dangers of alcohol consumption. While this proposition would greatly help France’s economy, it contradicts the country’s desire to lower excessive drinking and driving. It will be interesting to see what France’s final decision will be.
