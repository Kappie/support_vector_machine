Okay so I will update you all on my weekend alright? alright. Friday I had school I had to carry my pokemon bag, people stared and laughed. But Cory was like OMG Ashley your pokemon bag is cool. And I genuinely believed him. He can be really nice and constantly people are calling him fat and ugly and he goes along with it because they are his friends, I mean its okay sometimes but to deal with that... I couldn't Cory is TOUGH LOL. And then mike said he liked my bag at lunch and I was happy for a little bit. Then I went to all my classes and at the end of the day me Carly and Valeria got picked up by Elisa- valerias aunt and Olga- her mom. We went to Plum's ( Elisa's store where valeria works) and me and Carly went to Clair's and tried on fake hair stuff LOL. It was fun these little girls looked at us weird tho. Then we went back to the store and sat there and played with our cell phones. And then me and Carly went down to the new restaurant in the mall and we ordered subs. We got free pop :) LOL. Then we went back to the store and ate them..yum. These little girls all came in, they were in 4th grade and had these little purses it was cute, and they bought this "fart sucker" and it gives u gas if you eat it. Well they were telling us that this girl paige likes this one girls crush and stuff and paige calls her stuff. So valeria goes "what does she call you?" and she's like "stuff like an H-O-R and a B-I-T-C-H" so now one of our jokes is your such an HOR. thennn me and Carly get the bright idea to push Carly down the hall ways of the mall to go get some refills on our pop in the rolly-chair thing. Well we did, she almost hit a janitor, a garbage can and pop machine. We saw McKeon and Carlys like MCKEON! And he didn't hear so I pushed her over there. He's like :S LOL and all confused. Then when we got our pop I bought ice cream.....It was good.oh and by the way I was pushing her in a skirt...LOL that was interesting. Then I pretended I was Kristina from the store and Carly was elisa and we wore their name tags, it was fun. And we looked at the dirty stuff. It was gross...But some of it was funny. Then it was 8 and we cleaned up and Jes and Paola picked us up. It was sooo gross this nasty fat girl had a shirt on and it was one where its split from under your boobs, and It comes down into an upside down V. Well she was going to the ground floor...One of those girls. eiw. Well she was running and she like pulled her fat back. And jes is like "you should yell your fat go puke! out the window", but she was just kidding and Valeria rolls down the window is like "YOUR FAT GO PUT SOME CLOTHES ON" and jes took off and went so fast shes like "SHIT! how many new silver hondas are around here?" and there's like none, she was afraid they were gonna egg her car. It was funny. After that we went to jeremys and watched the t-wolves game for like 2 seconds, and jeremys mom had to bring us to the movies since jes and Paola left to go to a party. So we went to the movies and bought our tickets and then walked down to target. Valeria was mad at Jeremy so he was all sad and like left us to walk around. Well eventually we went to the bathroom. Well Ryan mostaller had bought a hello kitty pillow and I stole it and ran out the door. It was funny, she knew it was me she's like ASHLEY GIVE ME IT BACK! It was funny. Then we went to Shrek 2..It was sooo cute!Then we dropped Jeremy off and went to Valeria's (Me and Carly) We were really overly tired they had lucky charms and I ate ice cream well Carly spilled and valeria thought it was funny and she shot milk out of her mouth, then Carly called me an ass face and I choked on my ice cream and shot it out my nose****gross***** (ass face--inside joke)after that we went to bed and stuff. We woke up at 7:45...I have no clue why, it was all like at the same time too. freakay. Well we talked until 9:30 when we left. And me and valeria were craving subs so we went to the mall and got subs. Carly wanted to go really bad so we left after talking to Kristina at Plum's.  cuz Carly is going to a dashboard concert tonight with Kyle and Cory. she's SO lucky. That goose. LOL. And I got home and I was just looking on the internet for some cd's and stuff and Pat is all like "what are u doing?" I was like "updating my journal" ( lie I  know but whateva :P) and she's like "oh because you spend a lot of time on there and I was wondering what you always do." the way she said it was mean. Like I spend all my time on here. Sorry if I wanted to stay out of her hair, or not have to have her deal with me and lane fighting all the time. im not really on a lot anyways because my moms always home and doing business on here. Ugh. Oh well. I wanted to do something with Jozette today. Fly a kite :D but she's in Duluth and she gets her ipod! she's such a lucky giraffe. Well that's all for now. lubb yas.
