You know, radio, journalism, TV.  I am fame-hungary, though.  Who isn't, right?  I will be a media whore when I grow up.  I want to be famous.  I want to be rich.  And, I want to be the center of attention.  That's my problem.  I get a lot of attention as it is, and it still isn't enough.  I WILL be famous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BWAHAHAHA!!!!!!  I will virtually control the media!!!!!!!!!  Kinda like Britney Spears, except hopefully a little smarter (no offense, she's not STUPID, she's just.............  blonde.  Even though judging by her dark roots, not naturally.  I think the peroxide soaks through your skull and effects your brain like being blonde does, though.  Then again, I should shut-up because I used to have my hair highlighted to look blonde.).  Holy shit, I got waaaay off topic there.  Anyways, reading 'Animal Farm' in Language Arts really made me realize how greedy I am.  One day, we were talking about if everyone was equal, there would be somebody who would be greedy and want more, and I think that person would be me.  I also think that my daily routine lacks substance, but I honestly don't know how to change that, so if you do, e-mail me at mollio_88@hotmail.com, and tell me (knowing some of my friends, it will be incredibly perverted, so NO PERVERTED ANSWERS, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).  Anyway, back to the greedy thing, I like making waste your time reading this shit, too.  This is all completely useless information, and some people still actually read it!!!  I LOOOOOOVE that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyways, enough about me, I'm going to a baby shower today, and I hope to eat out, then, I have to do my stupid homework.  Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love this thing!!!!!!!!  ME, ME, ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's terrific!!!!  Gosh, I'm in a conceited, selfish mood today.  That's always good.  Well, on that note, I will talk to you tomorrow (God willing)!  Quote of the day: "I like going to overseas places, like Canada." --Britney Spears (to further drive home my point about the stupidity/blondeness thing)
