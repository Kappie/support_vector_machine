Is this all I get? I looked so hot but caught a cold I was doing just what I was told  To fit in    Chorus   We're sayin'  "Let's ask why, don't wear what they say Don't want to be a model; they can't eat anyway That kind of attention will fade with the day So, I'll stand up and say. . .  Clothes that fit are fine Won't show what's mine Don't change my mind I'll be fine   i love this song too! its by Barlow Girl!! you can go to their website at   www.barlowgirl.com  THEY ROCK!!!
