Hey, I forgot to tell you - AIM magazine (a publication of World Library Press, who makes the little missalettes that you see in a bunch of Catholic churches) wants me to write an article about my teen choir.  1500 words, $250.  I'm excited and nervous - probably why I haven't written it yet, or even started.  Deadline's a couple of months from now, so there's plenty of time (famous last words?).   As far as my "published composer" status, that still hasn't hasppened yet, either - contract's signed, but no other info.  GIA (the publisher) told me it could be 18 months - it's been 16 so far.    See ya,    Daf
