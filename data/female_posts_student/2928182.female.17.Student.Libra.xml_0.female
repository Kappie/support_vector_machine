Something she said last night also kept popping up in my mind, aside from all the things she said to keep me from bashing myself as I deserve. When she came back, she said "I'm not that strong". That just made me think...that I'm making her weak. I know it's not what she meant, but that's how I felt. Anyway, yeah so last night was not a good night. I had a dream too.  It went all the way back to Florida, in January. This was during the time that I hadn't talked to Chandra at all for awhile. I had died, but everyone had thought I'd run away. So my spirit wandered around...and finally I found Chandra. But she couldn't see me. She heard that I'd "run away", and for awhile she cried, thinking I forgot about her completely. But she moved on eventually. Years passed, and she met someone. With this person, she was never sad, never hurt. She was blissfully happy...happier than I could ever make her. She had children, and she adored them and the man she was with. She was finally able to realise that she is a beautiful person...something I feel I have been unable to do despite my best efforts. The last thing I noticed...was that she completely forgot about ever knowing me. In Florida it was already discovered that I was dead. My family were the only ones who grieved for me. I was forgotten by everyone. And my soul, me...I lingered. Lingered in the presence of Chandra, who no longer remember even being with me...who had no reason to.  Of all dreams, this one had to be the most in depth one. Wonderful...
