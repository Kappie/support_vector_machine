I think it is that he is lacking a relationship with Christ.(He claims to be catholic, but going to church is a hassle for them and they already claim there going to hell anyways. i dont really understand why he is like that. he supports me in my "church business" as he would call it. He doesnt like how i do it every weekend though, how i love it too. HE thinks church is torture.) I can understand that somehow i've hurt him by moving out of his home but i could not take the unholiness and the uptight "dont laugh your not funny atmostphere, your to hyper for our dry personalities." But what i dont understand is that when i call him, he doesnt feel the need to answer. I mean we started talking again after almost a year in february but before then he Refused to talk to me. I felt horrible. when he finally called me on that special valentines day this year, we agreed that our relationship would get back to normal. We even saw each other on that same day. It was a bit uncomfortable but I managed. I felt like the whole time i was being judged on everything, but i just remembered thats how it was at my dads house. So i started out calling him every other day. And that went well in the beginning, little did i know that he was trying to change the person that i have become. Trying to pull the carpet out from underneath my finally stagnant feet. My foundation was nearly constructed, with tidbits here and there willing to be glued for perfection. So, willing to fill in those holes, i started to listen to him, and change back to the person that i was, little by little. Finally when i realized what he was doing to me, i was in awe of what had happened. I had trusted him. He could not see my happiness through the what he was doing.But the remark from him that made me notice what he was doing was this very phrase: You cant hide behind religion. That killed me. I knew from then on he was trying to murder me and use my body for "the perfect child" in his mind. trying to tell me i wasnt good enough, too fat, and that i lowered my standards, whatever that means. he didnt notice that i finally loved the person who i had become.they couldnt see the change in personality that i have now. I have the Lord. He makes up the light of the world. My Father doesnt understand that everyone needs to have a relationship with Christ. So one day after he got through "the list of everything i need to do in order to become the person who i was in a past life", i just told him; that i didnt like how he was trying to run my life because for once i was on the right road and that i finally found my home in life. I didnt want to change my hair color or lose weight, or kill my personality. I also told him that i wasnt hiding behind my religion, and that it wasnt a religion, it was a relationship with christ. I told him i forgive him for everything he had done to me in the past and that he was only trying to figure out what was wrong with me. and then i told him why i was acting out: I wanted out. I could stand the restraint. I needed God.( i didnt notice it then but i really did need the lord. and i believe he caused me to act the way i was. and i believe he didnt want me there anymore.) He works in extrodinary ways. I knew it then but it didnt really click. The whole time i was being tortured at my fathers house, i was always praying to the Lord to help me and let me find the way out of trouble. Just the little things. Ive never done anything drastic before, so no need to worry about much. just like talking back and disobeying...i never hurt anyone by it...i just needed out.. i was yearning to be loved, and just to be hugged. I was basically in solitary confinment.couldnt talked to anyone in the house without having consequences and the only time they talked to me was when i was "in trouble". no hi or bye, no i love you, no hugs, no love. That when i started to believe that the world for me was over and that no one will ever love me again. ( I think that is half the reason why i am the person who i am now.) My Dad and stepmom took me to my "normal" counsling appts to try to figure out what was "wrong with me". The counselor saw nothign wrong with me. So they decided to talk to my parents(Dad and stepmom, and occasionally my mom) and they'd basically put words in everyones mouth, meaning not being able to fend for myself because they believed my parents over me. (We've had some good times before all this though, so you know my life before wasnt strictly hell. ) And dont get me wrong i love all these people to death, i just dont see why they wouldnt let me be, just listen to me once in my life. LET ME OUT was all i wanted to say. i couldnt understand why they were refraining me back from this world that i wanted to live in. So anyways, back to the story. They told the counselors that they thought i had a variety of disorders such as OCD(obsessive Compulsive Disorder), Bipolar, ADHD, PDS (Post Dramatic Stress),and on top of that ODD(something difiant disorder), when really....all it came out to be was jsut my personality. I believed them for a little bit until i moved in with my mother and noticed that none of that stuff was really true. I just needed out. So that part of my life was  very restrained. That was a bit of background in my life. But really what im trying to get at now is that he wont answer my phone calls. Everytime i call, the answering machine picks up. And im no good with messages. So one day he answered the phone after a few weeks and told me i was going down hill and all that jazz..(when my grades werent good) and that when i leave a message to not say "hey its me" because he has a name. But im not directing the message to just him its basically to everyone. So yeah, im just going to leave it up to God to work on my father and our relationship. Just have to have faith and not rush myself because these things take time right? right. HEy ive notice that this thing is a good counselor. :) maybe i should tell them that i found one....theyd probably put me in for sessions again. ANNNNNYYYWHHHOOO... So im just going to live life the way i have been. Maybe he thinks that not talking to me will bring me down....hmmm... never thought of it that way. I have no clue what really brought this on to write about this but somehow it all just poured out. Dont really know what to do..there isnt much. I just keep calling and praying.   Well...   " Then Peter came to Him and said,"Lord how often shall my brother sin against me, and i forgive him, up to seven times?" Jesus said to him, " I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."- Matthew 18:21-22.
