Cuz i piss them off all the time and all they do is ask,, "when we goin to ur moms?". They want me to help them which this book... i duno if i want to... cuz then im gonna feel as though im sex crazed... which im not... because i dont even have sex... well i guess thats a crime nowadays...   I've come to the conclusion that i never have anything to say. Maybe ill just stop talking to people that judge you on what you say... that's why I like my guy friends... they never do that... and Im not saying that ALL my gurlies do.. but ya know how the female species is... I can actually have a good conversation with my guy friends that never ends with somone saying "yeah i fucked my boyfriend last night" or something related to their sex-life.   Oh yeah I got silver in VICA... Maybe it's time i go on co-op to be free from the people that make me feel like shizzle...  -Heather-Heather-   welll fuck head if we make you feel like shit so much why did you keep talking to us ... why do you always fucking never tell us shit that makes you feel like shit... how are we supposed to be good friends if you wont let us no what the hell is bugging you and then fucking write it in your journal and brag about how awesome your bfs friends are because tahts all you are gonna have left ... thats all i have to say good day
