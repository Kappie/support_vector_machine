This semester, I was calm, confident and on top of shit.  Once I started, that is.  The morning was split between avoiding practice exams, doing one question and breakfast/lunch with Sadie.  The three hours flew by and I emerged from the building with a huge weight lifted.  Suddenly the next three exams are entirely do-able.  We seem to be taking tonight off; got the Crim Law flashcards out, looked at one, and put them back on the table.  Now we have the Friends special of Dateline going.  It's so odd that a night of TV has become a luxury.    But I'll take it.
