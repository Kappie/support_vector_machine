If i were an airport, my forehead would probably one of the runways at KLIA ( see? im patriotic.. i couldve said Heathrow .. but no.. im VERY MALAYSIAN .. hahaha) Unfortunately, im not getting any smarter. Im saying this just to refute the idea that pple with wide foreheads are supposed to be more intellectually advantaged. hah .. i wish!  I just had another teaching session with dr m .. and like the last time, i came out of the room feeling like i knew less than when i went in. He was nice tho'.. in the sense that he didnt pick on any one of us .. unlike some consultants who absolutely loooove picking on students and making them feel like midgets. it was a cardiology teaching session .. and hmmpphh.. ol' 'handsome boy' whom i had mentioned in one of my previous posts turned out to know his stuff afterall. i never said he was stupid.. i just said he was a SNOB.   last night i watched this programme on the telly .. cant remember the name of it .. about this competition where the winners get to go to india and undergo intensive training to star in some bollywood movie or something. (thanks zak for reminding me!) it was an enjoyable watch .. all these shah-rukh and kajol wannabes .. part of the audition required the participants to act out a scene given to them on the spot. omigoodness.. and they have to be EXTRA melodramatic and theatrical .. bcos thats what bollywood movies are all about, aren't they? anyways.. the chosen 6 have been announced and next week they're gonna show the British public the kind of training and what-have-u's these 6 underwent in India. oh.. one of these 6 is a caucasian drama student who doesnt speak a word of Hindi.. and she wants to star in a bollywood film. go figure ......
