As soon as I'm done drinking my morning coffee I have to go over to Jeff's mom's work so that we can write up a contract before anyone changes their minds. I'm so happy. This house needs some fixing up, which won't be cheap, but it's going to be well worth it. The only downfall is that we have to write in the contract that my mom can live here with us for as long as she needs to without having to pay rent and that if Bill ever gets to where he can't take care of himself then he gets to come live with us too. I don't mind those things. I did want to have my  own  place, but I surely don't mind sharing. Another bad thing too is that if and when mom comes down here to live, I have to tell Dad he's got to go. But he needs to go regardless anyhow. I love him but I don't like living with him.  On to something else- I saw this little questionaire thing on some persons blog and I thought it was cute so I want to do it too.  1.Spell your name backwards: EISSEJ 2.Where do you live?
