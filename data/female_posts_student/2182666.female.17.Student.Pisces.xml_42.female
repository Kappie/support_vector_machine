(no not sex) finding $20 in your jeans pocket!! THEN tonight i went shopping!! i was supposed to go to ramsey's house to study with deb but she gives horrible directions!! so yeah i went shopping and got 3 new shirts, a pair of headphones that go behind your head (i've wanted them forever!!), and some picture frames for prom pics!! it was so much fun. i love shopping and i dont care how materialistic that makes me sound.  well since i got no studying done today with deb i should probably go do some!! i am in such a good mood that studying for algebra 2 and chem cant ruin it!! yay ok well i will see you ballers tomorrow  jess  ohh no!! i just remembered that i have a doctor's appointment tomorrow afternoon and i havent taken my medicine in a looong time. uh oh..
