The foremost thought on my mind at the moment is my love life. Rob came up and spent most of the weekend with me. We got along really well, had good conversation, I made dinner (note to self: not everyone likes Good Goat burritos), and we watched a few movies (The Transporter on video and Matrix Reloaded at the theatre). The surprise he brought me was a real rose covered in 24K gold. Wow. Bottom line�he is a really great person, we get along swell and he is really (and I mean really) nice. If given enough time and attention I think the relationship would definitely have the potential to bloom. But with things the way they are now, with the distance, the fact that he is a hard working man, and the fact that I am NOT working (or driving for that matter) will put a damper on the time and attention. The great news is I have made a really good friend. But as of right now, judging on the conversations we have had on the subject, it is going to mutually stay just that. Good Friends, and although there may be a possibility for more, I am really happy with finding that :) I have no further dates planned�with anyone that is�which brings me back to where I started. Woo Hoo for me!  Another subject�can you guess�is the employment problem. I am working on finishing this test for  urlLink United Rentals . It is called a �Caliper Profile� and it is designed basically to discover what kind of work ethic I have and coincidently what kind of employee I would be. I am not worried about the results, but I should have faxed it to them Friday and here it is Monday. I should get to finishing it I think. It is a really good job and a really good opportunity, and I really need to start working hard on getting it.  Come one, come all to the  urlLink In-N-Out  Company Family Picnic! This is an annual occasion with my family. Seeing as though my father worked for the  urlLink In-N-Out  company for over 30 years, my family has attended since I was a baby. Almost all the �high ups� know who we are, and most of my siblings still work for the company. The picnic will be at  urlLink Knott�s Berry Farm  again this year. It has changed locations a couple times, but has been there for the last 3 years or so. The day will include free In-N-Out grub plus nachos, popcorn, cotton candy and all that jazz. After we eat we get the park to ourselves for a couple hours. It should be a fun time, and I get to spend some quality time with my family.   I think that is good for now. Of course I will be back�eventually�  Do me a favor�Smile :)
