It's not like I don't find it interesting, but it just takes a while.  Listening to the Strokes. Yay.  I have nothing deep and profound to say. I think I'm going to run over to Baskin Robbins tomorrow and get a gift certificate for Nige, then go to the Gap to return something (petty, frivolous chore), then to the post office to send off Ellis's package to Jessica and Nigel's card. My big brother's growing up! Aw. I'll probably make a trip to CVS tonight to get a card. I'm just thinking, do I want to wake up that early to get things done, or should I just wait until Friday?  Oops, I was supposed to go to Tozzer today, and I completely forgot. I have anthro reading to do anyways.  I love it when nobody else is in the room and I can turn on/off the lights as I want, scrap the headphones and turn off the fan. I'm curious to know what the roommates think of me. Oh, that Lydia, she listens to music too loud all the time, doesn't take her stuff out of the shower after she's done, doesn't make her bed, has the messiest desk in the dorm...  I can't believe how fast SSP has gone by.   I want to look forward to this weekend, but I have the paper to write too. Where does all my time go? I went to breakfast this morning, came back and kind of did work on the tutorial, went to lunch and came back and read, went to get smoothies, read, dinner, reading...ew, it's 6:37 already. And even worse, I'm tired.  This Strokes CD isn't as good as the first one. Same with Death Cab. Well, I have time to enjoy them. It's going to be such driving music when I get home. I've forgotten how to drive, probably--how weird is it to drive for one month on a license exactly, go away for two and then come back? When my six months are up, it won't really be six months of driving under my belt but four. I can't even imagine myself driving and wonder how I could've managed to do something that seems so difficult. But I miss my freedom.  To work.
