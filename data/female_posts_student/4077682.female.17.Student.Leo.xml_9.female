But one of their big rules is... NO FRIENDS.       A  re you joking me.      That is dumb... but I think that I will have friends over. I mean really. Who lets their 17 year old daughter stay at home during the weekend and expect her not to have friends over. I think that when im a parent, im gonna be so much more chill about stuff like this. I guess ill just have to be carelful everything stays ok, and that they don't find out.      Peace.
