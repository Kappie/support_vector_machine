Sugarcult    One of my fave bands at the moment is Sugarcult and anyone who also likes that kinda music should check them out. Their most recent album, released in 2004, is Palm Trees and Power Lines. The band consists of Tim, on vocals, guitar and songwriting, Marko on guitar, Airin on bass and vocals and Kenny on drums. The band's debut album, Start Static, was released in 2001 and the band have been huge ever since! To find out more about the band you can visit the official website, which is  urlLink www.sugarcult.com         The Starting Line    This band is also one of my emo favourites. Introduced to me by one of my closest mates, Ben Coles, god of all things emo, I have loved the band since I first heard them a while back. There's four mebers of The Starting Line; Kenny Vasoli on bass and vocals, Tom Gryskiewicz on drums, Matt Watts on guitar and Mike Golla on guitar. The band released their debut album, Say It Like You Mean It, in 2002 and it sold over 300,000 copies! To read more about the band and to hear some of their music, go to  urlLink www.startinglinerock.com         Hoobastank    I first saw Hoobastank new video and single, The Reason on Kerrang! TV and thought the song was awesome. So, I checked out the new ablum, also called The Reason, and I have to say, it's pretty cool. The band's members are Doug Robb on vocals, Dan Estrin on guitar, Chris Hesse on drums and Markku Lappalainen on bass. Their website is  urlLink www.hoobastank.com  if you wanna hear more.       Jimmy Eat World    Last summer, me and my mate, Georgi, went to Devon together and spent the entire week listening to Jimmy Eat World's fourth album, Bleed American (2001). Some of their previous album's hadn't been as good, but we immediately fell in love with this album. They have a new album out, called Futures, which is due to released October 19. I don't actually know anything about the band, but if you wanna look into it, I do know that ther official website is  urlLink www.jimmyeatworld.net         All-American Rejects    I know some people hate this band and yell at me whenever they are mentioned, 'They are such rejects! They sure chose a fitting name! They could have called themselves 'The All-American Retards!' *cough* Cat *cough*. However, I think their music is good, being of such weird taste as I am. Their self-titled album has some wicked songs on it frankly! The debut album, 'The All-American Rejects' was released in 2003 and their first single, 'Swing, Swing' was a smash hit! So, in the band, we've got Tyson Ritter on vocals and bass, Nick Wheeler on guitar, keyboards and programming, Mike Kennerty on guitar and Chris Gaylor on drums. For more info on the band go to  urlLink www.allamericanrejects.com           AFI    As a few, or many, people know, AFI is also known as A Fire Inside. Ther are four members; vocalist Davey Havok, guitarist Jade Puget, bassist Hunter and drummer Adam Carson. They released their first album in 1995, Answer That and Stay Fashionable. After a series of many other albums, their latest being Sing The Sorrow (2003), the band are still hugely successful in the USA and the UK. If you wanna hear all their other albums and learn about the band's whole history go to  urlLink www.afireinside.net     That's only five bands, I know. The list goes on, but I couldn't be arsed, so I just put some top bands on there... Other bands to look out for are:      Dashboard Confessional   Bowling For Soup   Story of The Year   Something Corporate   Yellowcard   Taking Back Sunday   New Found Glory   Less Than Jake   NOFX      if there's any bands who should be here, but aren't post a comment and I'll add them happily (unless it's crap)      Peace,
