JetRedZombie. gettin tired of the love below. been feeling depressed again lately. i dont know why either. i mean nothing out of the norm has happened to me as of late, but i've just seem more depressed than ussual. im getting sick and tired of these fucking people in my life. i hate most of them, but i still try to treat them all fair and nice and put them all before me and stuff. sometimes i think im too nice, i just let people step all over me. i'll be glad when this is all over. i dunno man..i cant wait till im fucking twenty one. i'll go drown in something.
