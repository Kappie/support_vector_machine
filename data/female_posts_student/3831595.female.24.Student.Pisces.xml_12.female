I've been in a rather reflective mood today (I hope that doesn't mean that I am dying), and I feel that there have been some people in my life that I owe apologies. So, in no particular order, here they are:   To Chris Wilson, or Wickson (additional apology: I can't seem to remember your last name - If you're reading this and you were the kid who wore a tie to school every day in 6th grade, this is probably you, it's too big of a coincidence to not be): I apologize for laughing at you when you asked me out. Not because I actually laughed as I said no, but because of the reason that I laughed. You had ketchup on your face and I didn't tell you. I've been carrying that guilt with me for the past 13 years.  To Robin Yaski: When we were in first or second grade, my friends and I would follow you around the playground saying "BOOM" whenever you walked, and would scream "EARTHQUAKE" when you tried to run away from us. On behalf of the whole gang, we are sorry. It's just that you were the first overweight person any of us had ever seen in person. I am sure that you have lost the weight since then.  To Scott Murphy (Okay, I made that last name up, I can't seem to remember yours either): I am sorry that my friends and I spent most of Homecoming freshman year hiding from you in the bathroom. You were just really creepy. I am sure that you have outgrown it, or have been arrested since then.  To the lunch ladies at Anderson High School: I apologize for intentionally crumpling up my money into a large ball whenever I paid for my lunch. I am even more sorry for pretending not to know what you were pointing at when you ever-so-rudely would point to the "Please unfold your money" sign taped to the side of your cash register.  To the girl that stood next to me in chorus at Colonial Elementary: I am sorry that I had faster reflexes than you, which resulted in the girl standing behind me puking in your hair, instead of mine.   I think that about covers it all. Man, I was a mean kid. Seriously, these are the things that I did that I am sorry about, there is so much that I'm not remorseful over. But that was then and this is now, right?  Okay - time for a more happier mood...  Matt sent me this article that most of you have probably read from my AOL away message, but if not,  urlLink here you go . My only question is, HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?????  Not a whole lot else going on, just killing time working from home. As you can see, I've been most productive today.
