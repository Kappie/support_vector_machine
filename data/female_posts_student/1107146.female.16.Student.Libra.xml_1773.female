Staying with the G-Parentals isn't ever on the top of the list, especially for more than a day...well, at least my craaazy redneck ones down south, YEEHAW! My grandmother is frickin' nuts, and it makes me want to, like, SCREAM AT HER, "STOP BEING SO DAMNED PSYCHOTIC!!! RRRRAAAAAUUUGGGHHH!!!!" Heh. Eagh, please survive Abby Mac, only two days, two days, two days.
