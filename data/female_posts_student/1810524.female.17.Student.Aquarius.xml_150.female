(obviously not in the room, that'd b gross!) we were upstairs watchin a film n on her trampoline n they were...busy...! but for him to now go for her?! it really relaly hurts!   i mean, i know that ive moved on (obviously) coz im with pete and its great, and i dont expect him to be single forever....but i supose a part of me must still love him abit, not mch, just lil bit...and it hurt because i no her! it woud be fine if it was a stranger! but its not! and she links to our past! we got close at her house! therefor she's part of our history and now he wants her!!! im gettin flustered again.  Vx
