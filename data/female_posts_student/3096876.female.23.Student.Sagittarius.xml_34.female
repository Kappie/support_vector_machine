It was a fabulous day...30degree weather, beautiful clear sunny sky all day.  I sat in the backyard with a great book,  Straw Dogs  by John Gray, sucked back a couple of beers, and listened to some chill tunes on the ol' mp3 player!  I couldn't have wished for a more perfect day.  I love summertime, and I love going to the beach.  The two, of course, go hand in hand.  In breaking up with Brent, I get to kiss goodbye my yearly camping trip at  urlLink Sauble Beach  (which is ok, 'cause I'm sure Montreal will be full of new memories!) Sauble is perhaps my most favorite place in the world.            I was so glad to hear from Mom that my cousins were going to spending May 24 weekend at their property at Sauble, and eeeeeeverybody's invited.  Yahoo!  I was explaining this to one of my friends.  He thought it was really cool, having family with a cottage at a cool place like that.  "No,  property .  As in, just a lot: no power hook-up, no running water.  Just some grass and some trees."  I'm concerned for Ally--will she be able to "rough it"?  I know  I  can pee outside, but I'm not sure about her!  Another thing about summer and the beach: surfer movies!  And surfer music!  I just started listening to a ton of  urlLink Dick Dale  and I totally dig the tunes!  Totally!    ... I had a little mini-adventure today.  Funny story.  Mattee called me from the Dot, fresh from a killer interview at Ogilvy  Mather and his recent win at the IHAVEANIDEA ads contest, asking if I wanted to join him in a celebratory doobie when he got back.  Sure!  Catch was, I had to pick his ass up from the O-Town GO.  No prob!  Wait... prob.  I got to the station at the appointed time, but there was no train and no Mattee!  Only an announcement that trains were being delayed because of a chemical fire in Clarkson...yikes!  I called Mattee, he said that they're being held up at Port Credit, and won't I please, please, pretty please come and pick up his sorry ass?  Yeah, OK, fine.  As I sit at the side of the road waiting for Mattee to find me (no point in looking for him, he looks just like the 1000s of other marooned commuters waiting for rides) and he saunters up to my car, a 40-something looking man in a suit in tow. "I made a friend," he emphatically tells me.  WTF???  Did he seriously pick up some random guy at the train station? "Hi, I'm Paul," the man says, leaning into my car and offering a hand. I'm sure Mattee could see the puzzled look on my face, and bailed me out without much further ado. "Paul is Steph's dad."  Ohhh, thanks Mattee.   Who the fuck is Steph?   Well, whatever.  Paul left me 10bucks as I dropped him off, as thanks for coming out to get them.   Well actually Paul, I came to get Mattee.  Mattee, where the fuck is your "cab-fare"?  Ohhh, a PRD, huh?  That's ok then.   Whatev, but that was some wicked karma, Paul!  Paid for the dinner I missed 'cause I was driving all over hell's half-acre (I don't know why, but I really love that phrase.)
