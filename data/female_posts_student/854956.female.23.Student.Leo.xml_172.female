I mean, I'm probably gonna chop off my hair some come summertime anyway...  Texas summers are too hot to have long hair.  But, I dunno... we'll see.  I may decide to keep the length.  ;)  Anyhow, I'm going to work on my music compostion some more now after I finish up my laundry.  OH!  I think I get to see Steve tomorrow... :-D  I dunno... depends on whether or not he's needed at another site and if we get the new gal.  Bye bye for now.
