We had a guest speaker, and he was cool, but I missed pastor J too.  O man...if we  EVER  sing  I am Running , ever,  EVER ,   EVER   again...I will have to scream.  I swear, it's Rachel's favorite song, and we sang it through at least  25  times...not even joking. I mean, the first 5 or 6 times it was  OK , but after that many...o man, I was ready to leave the stage. O well, the group seemed to like it, so...whatever. Yeah, so then I went to my girlies' basketball game, while the rest of the people went home because of the  tornado warning ...but I mean, come on guys...this is  Wisconsin , nothing exciting like that  ever  happens around here.  So...anyway, the girls lost their game, but at least I got to see some of my friends.  I went to  Starbucks  with Amanda afterwards, and then to her house...her dog burned his nose in the candle...lol! Not what I expected I'll tell ya. Hope your day was cool, keep havin fun, and don't forget about me...lol. See you soon M.R.! ~kendra
