I have just read that fifteen men died from Camp Pendleton and I am sure that many of those men have wives and children they are leaving behind.  I think that this hits me hard because the men whohave died come from the group that Ed will be joining this June.  Yes, I am scared.  I am terrified.  This is the worst reality a military spouse must face.  The reality that their loved one may not come bacl  All the feelings I felt when he was gone last year are gushing back and maybe that is why I am unable to sleep.  I find myself watching him sleep and thinking,"God I can't live without you in my life."  That is how much I love Ed.  Yes he drives me crazy and yes some days I want to strangle him.  But I cannot honestly see myself without him.  He is such a huge part of me, a huge part of my life.  Then I see and hear about these families who do lose their loved ones and I think to myself, how do they do it?  I hope and pray I never have to expereince what they experienced because I honestly do not know if I would have the strength and the will to move on.  I am sorry this was so sad.  I just read the news and imagined that that could easily be us and that is scary.  Gives new meaning to live for today and enjoy because tomorrow is not guaranteed.
