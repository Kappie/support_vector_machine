They consumed as much and as fast mineral water as possible. One of them fell into coma after he had drunk about 4 litres. Reason: due to the intrusion of much water into your organism the cells of your body expand. This can be very dangerous if the brain is affected; the amplified cells press against the scullcap and you might fall into coma.
