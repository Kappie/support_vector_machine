There was one good thing that happened today. Kelly got me Finding Nemo. :) That made me happy. Very happy. Then...my day just went downhill from there.  Oh yeah. Jazz is going to suck unbelievably this year. UGHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  Tom is possibly the biggest jerk I know. I mean...really. I honestly don't see any redeeming qualities in him. Dan's not even as bad as Tom. I at least can get along with Dan. We joke and stuff but....Tom's just an ass. I'm not one for swearing often, but he is.   Ugh, I just don't even feel like typing I'm so annoyed.
