I checked his profile and guess what was in there? A song:   i will never find anotha lover, sweeter than u, sweeter than u  n i will never find anotha lover more precious than u, more precious than u  girl u are close to me ur like my motha,  close to me ur like my fatha,  close to me ur like my sister,  close to me ur like my brother  u are the only one my everythin and for u this song I sing   all my life ive prayd for sum1 like u  n i thank god that i, that i finally found u  all my life ive prayd for sum1 like u  n i hope that u feel the same way too  yes, I pray that u do love me too   i said ur all that im thinking of.....baby   said, i promise to never fall in love with a stranger,  ur all im thinking of, i praise the lord above,  for sending me ur love, i cherish every hug,  i really love you   SHIT.....this hurts. It hurts b/c i know how this feels. And to know i'm causing that kind of pain to someone and theres nothing i can do to help.....it kills me. This is someone I really do care about, but not in that way. And i need to prove the pionts I've been trying to prove to him. But look at this:  me:	dan him:	hey me:	this hurts him:	it kills me me:	and thats y it hurts me just as bad me:	say something him:	will anythn chnage ur mind? me:	no i dont think so me:	but i dont want 2 hurt u him:	2 late me:	can n e thing at least make u feel better him:	gimme anotha chance him:	plz me:	i cant me:	dan me:	i wish i could me:	but i cant  SHITCRAPFUCKDAMN what the hell is goin on? Part of me says "God damnit Maddie, take him back". But the other part, that i seem to be listening to, says "you idiot- you kno what'll happen if you do....the same thing that happened last time". And it probably will. If I can't trust myself to make the right descision, who can I trust? I wish nothing I did hurt anyone. Maybe myself, but please god spare everyone else the pain, it's not worth it. It really isn't. I'm going now, but don't worry, I'll be back. Soon. I love you ALL. bye :(
