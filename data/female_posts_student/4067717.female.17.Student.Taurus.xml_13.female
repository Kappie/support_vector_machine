Is it wrong to use someone for your own purposes if they're too clueless to know what you're doing?  If you know, without a doubt, that you might be able to do something with your life to benefit mankind, is it morally wrong to spend it doing something you love, instead?  Are all boys idiots? Scratch that. Know the answer.  How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop? I will never know, because I always bite it.  Why are lower-quality books and movies so much more gratifying than the 'classics'?  Why, when no one is going to read it, am I writing this?
