Friday I'm interviewing for the other job, so please wish me luck!  It would mean almost 200 more per week, which would almost mean I could afford to live without a roommate until I can save up for my PhD.  In the meantime I get to deal with grief counseling with my volunteers tomorrow as well as orienting 2 of my new interns to the hell that is Thursday at Teen Court.  Never a dull moment, eh?  Oh wait...then there's my personal life...
