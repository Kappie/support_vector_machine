When I have nothing to do, I think too much. Plus, although others may argue, you can only read for  so  long!  When I was watching TV today, I found A Wedding Story, I always like that one the best out of them all because it's so happy. When the groom was asked to say something about his bride he said that she fit in his nook. Meaning that when he hugs her she fits perfectly, it feels right, and it's the safest place for him to be. I thought that was so sweet! I want to fit into someone's nook! I just want that something to hold on to that feels right.  I'm going to shower now, my hair is gross! ~Kaylala
