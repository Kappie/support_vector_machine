More on that later.   I am so pissed at Erika. She is so retarded sometimes. She's annoyed that I always need the last word, and yeah, I guess that can get annoying but listen: I was arguing with my dad and I was disagreeing and attempting to get the last word subconsciously and Erika like, storms off because I was doing it. I don't even understand why she thinks that she has the right to just get all angry because I was arguing with someone else. Frankly, I don't give a crap, so whatever.   Went to PoA with Corey, Shelly, and Erika this morning. It was at the IMax and it was pretty cool. Erika and I got there early and we had to sit through this documentary about caribou. Then Shelly and Corey got there and the movie started after a little while. Once the movie started, i was a little annoyed because of the excess cuddling (corey-shelly). I mean, I can understand the hand holding and stuff, but it's just really annoying to me, and i don't know why. Erika was even more annoyed. Don't know why she even cares..anyway.   I am so bored. I can't wait until the pool is done tomorrow, I am going to go swimming! I am so excited. I got to jump in before Erika :-P. FIrst time ever...and it's my pool to begin with! Whatever. Grrr, she annoys me right now. Anyway, I guess I will stop writing...not much to do besides internet which sound completely boring. Maybe I will go for a run or something. I could play the violin...babbling now, must go.
