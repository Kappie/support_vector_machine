I am not allowed to go anywhere because of the roads, so I am stuck here with my little brother. What fun!! Not!! I don't want to go to school but I don't want the weather to be so bad that I can't get out of the house! I guess that I will have to make the best of it. This kinda reminds me of Quarentine, sorry if misspelled. Have you been working on any other 11/8 songs Matthew?   I guess I will put my TOP 6 Hal McCuen Plays. I have only been on 5 but I saw one so I will add that one.  6: Three Times A Charm, Distime For Sure. Professional time Traveler, who didn't know her lines to save her life.   5: Melissa K. Merdock Will You Please Go Home Now? Cheyenne Wyhoming, girl who love lolliepops so much she had them coming out of her head. I guess it is true what they say, "You are what you eat."  4: Nothing Doesn't Happen in McCuen. Sorry Morgan's mom. Summer Thyme, ditzy wanna be cop. Sorry about the whole, almost falling of the stage thing.  3: Where-Wolf? Tamika, evil fairy  2: Quarentine Mitch, an orphan. And yes all girls have guys names.  1: Moment of Ping. I know that I wasn't in that one but I thought that you guys did a great job. Plus that was the first HMC production I saw.   Well, that is my list, and if you have a problem with it, in the words of Cassie and Heather (who i hear so much about) "build the bloody bridge." Thank you Cassie and Heather.
