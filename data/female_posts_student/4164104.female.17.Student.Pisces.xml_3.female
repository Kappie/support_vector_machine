I always hate times and distances.  you get these numbers that are supposed to measure your abilities.  freaking swimmers in the olympics lose by .06 of a second.   Maybe i'd like times and distances if i worked better with them.  But i'm very inconsistant.  So for the sake of the world that loves times and numbers and scores, i'll let you know the second i cross the finish line.  Just so you can relate it back to the knowledge of what a good mile is.  standards, grades, times of the freaking mile-  i loved  not  having you around this summer.  but watch, 2 weeks into the season, and i'll be secretly looking down on girls who couldn't run as fast as i could--- or if i'm real bad, looking down on myself (how is that possible, look down.. on yourself).  I'd like for the numbers not to matter.  I really would.  but then too much else starts to lose the purpose.  So i'll roll with it for a while.  for the love of the game.   i'll do what i can, we'll leave it at that.   peace
