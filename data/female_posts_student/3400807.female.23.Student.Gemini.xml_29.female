Sorry everyone. I forgot to mention that I was leaving the state for several days. Hence no updates. I'm very tired. (Adjusting back to west coast time from being on the east coast... is a lot easier than the reverse was when we went out there!) Anyway, what I meant to do is direct you over to  urlLink The Cats Away  while I was gone. So... go read there. My good friend  urlLink Ilsa  was kind enough to watch my babies for me while I was gone and to post their thoughts so I wouldn't miss them so much... I have the next week off and I need to finish unpacking all the stuff that got shoved in storage from our move because I didn't feel like dealing with it. So I have the feeling I'll be writing here a lot. Because I'm one of the best procrastinators I know... That's all for now. Thanks.
