I hate this horrible world I am forced to live in. I hate this body my spirit is forced to move in.   I am so full of hate..  But that hate was formed by deep sadness.  I fear I will never be fully happy.  I will never have that joy that comes from you.  I am off to cry in the bathroom.  The only place of solidtude it this horrible world.   Save me.
