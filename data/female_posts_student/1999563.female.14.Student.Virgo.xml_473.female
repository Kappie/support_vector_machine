This one guy there ran right into me on purpose then he kept walking but he turned and smiled at me and I was like "Right..."  Tomorrow I shall be very busy. Ay yi yi! I have an orthodontist thing at 11 then I have a meeting with my college counselor at 2:30 then I have to go to spanish. It doesn't seem like much..but it is!  I really need to clean too..I wanted to get this really cool shirt. It says "We be illin" on it then under that it says "Sacred Heart Childrens Hospital" hahhaha. I think its quite amusing. Ever since I posted my blog for everyone ot see weirdo people have been e-mailing me..i'm like "Alright..."  :)  Later gators!  laura fantora
