SO today..I am doing nothing..I will probably read..(like i have been doing everyday..I've read about 10 books this summer already..and we've been off not even 3 weeks yet..lol) but this is a good book.. How I Spent my Last Day on Earth  by some guy named Todd, and I forget his last name. Well..grrr I have nothing to do. I might get lunch somewhere..but probably not. geeze, someone give me a suggestion for something to do! well..this is it for now..I will probably write mroe later.
