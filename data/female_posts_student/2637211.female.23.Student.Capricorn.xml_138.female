And, if you don't know much about me, in high school I was *very* active in the UMC Youth Fellowship, and even went to a convention in Knoxville, TN. I almost decided to become a youth minister. Oh, and I was pro-gay marriages and pro-choice even then, before you think I was a crazy Christian coalition girl. Those people scared me even then. I'm all about liberal Christianity that's about love. I always thought that was the point.
