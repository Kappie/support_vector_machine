And, no, that is not my current means of transportation because I got hit by an old lady and Steve wont let me have the car....shut up, Guy.  I know you're thinking something really snide or sarcastic...  Its so purty!  We got it at Target (Tar-zhaaaay) on Sunday afternoon! Now I just have to learn how to ride it.  HA!  Gotcha!  I  know  how to ride, sillies!    I totally felt like PeeWee Herman all polishin' the bike and talking to it, an' shit... pathetic!     Giggle!
