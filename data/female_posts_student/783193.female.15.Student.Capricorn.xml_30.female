My name is Turd Furgeson (courtesy of Grant) and I witnessed a dark figure influencing Wayne Thompson when I was fishing with my friend.. um.. Whatshisface. Something Weed, or something. I don't think this is going to go well.Picture taking for music classes today. We spent about half an hour waiting for other groups to take their pictures, and then another half an hour to set up. Mrs. Cable spent about twenty minutes of that half-hour trying to get everyone's violins to look exactly the same way, and then the photographer adjusted a little in the middle, and guess what. Everyone moved their violins. It was rather funny. Shopping was.. fun. It passed really quickly. Of course, Jodi kept us amused the whole time.. "I dont' know if I should be buying the shirt! I mean, do I really want it? Do I really, really want it? What about the American Idol one? And then what about the Chicago soundtrack? I can't wait a whole DAY to get it!" Then there was the whole Chen drawing on her hand with eye makeup.. and Cynthia reading her Manga throughout the mall, WITHOUT looking up, and Cissy's obsession with pins. By the time we went home, I think we were all exhausted. Practiced Telemann Concerto today, during lunch. It sounds okay. Better than the other one, anyway. I think this one is easier, or more melodic or something. We had an audience of.. two people. Wow, I know. They liked it. Note to my sister [the nerdy one]: You really are a nerd. You were a semi-nerd, before, but now you've got the smarts to prove it. Ha. I wasn't really complimenting you. *dances away (nimbly) before she brings Gareth and Bill to pound me* You can see my extreme nerdy sister here...  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/Slideshow2.jsp?UV=312520146936_17118467703=88363184703photoid=20046215703=1044424225245state=  and here  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/Slideshow2.jsp?UV=312520146936_17118467703=88363184703photoid=80046215703=1044424225245state=  and here  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/Slideshow2.jsp?UV=312520146936_17118467703=88363184703photoid=39936215703=1044424225245state=  Okay, so what if she's better looking than me? She's still a nerd. And I'm a Turd. Heh. heh. heh. Sorry, dears, no quizzes today. I didn't have time to take them. Off to shower, and remove the pungent stink from myself.
