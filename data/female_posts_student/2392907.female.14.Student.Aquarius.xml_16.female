"Let's go get drinks," suggests Nazrene. "Damn, the free ones have run out." "I don't want a drink yet," says Jane. Philippa has wandered off somewhere with Matt.  What am I doing here?  Jane wonders. "Don't worry, some hot guy will find you," says Nazrene psychically. Jane has grown used to this now.  I don't want some hot guy to find me. I want Adam.  "Well you can't  have  Adam right now. He's not here." And it isn't long before a hot guy finds Jane.  "Hey," a voice purrs (God that's disturbing). Jane almost jumps out of her skin. "Hey," the voice repeats. Jane turns around. "Err, hi," she says, managing to smile. "Can I get you a drink?" "Um, yeh." He walks her over to the drinks. He grins at a guy who has his head down and two drinks in his hand. "What do you want?" "I've have a Sprite." He looks at her strangely. "I mean, erm, Sprite with vodka. Yuh." And so he gets her the Sprite.. with vodka, and gets himself some random drink.  "You look great," he comments.  Oh my god he's hitting on me , thinks Jane. "Thanks." "What's your name?" he asks. "Jane," she replies. He laughs.  That makes two of us then, Adam,  he thinks. "How about your name?" "I'm Ryan."
