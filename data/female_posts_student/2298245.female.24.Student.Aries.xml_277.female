To me, it matters only so far as the Spanish need to know who is responsible for the purposes of justice.  And it matters so that the world can know what the threat is.  But it doesn't matter in another sense - the war we are fighting now is not the war against al-Qaeda.  It is the war against terrorism, and that, to me, means all terrorism, regardless of the name or form it takes.  No matter whether it is the same people responsible for 9/11 or not, we should express solidarity and support for Spain and the Spanish people.    UPDATE:  Maybe this is too early to say, as it's just in and its reliability could be questioned, but several news outlets are reporting  urlLink something like this :   A van with detonators and an Arabic-language tape of Koranic verses were found near Madrid, Interior Minister Angel Acebes said Thursday, opening new lines of investigation into the train bombings. So far, the probe has focused on the Basque separatist terror group ETA.   No idea what it means...yet.  But as it's related, and this is a matter of pressing importance, I thought I'd post it.  If this is indeed al-Qaeda, I hope it will awaken the rest of the world that this is not just an American problem.  And if it is ETA, then I hope that it will awaken the world to the disparate treatment and hypocrisy of European reaction to this in comparison with the terrorist attacks perpetrated by the Palestians in Israel.  Things like this shouldn't have to happen for us to take stock of what is going on in the world.  When will the politicians finally start to listen?  UPDATE II:  Just a small  urlLink squib from Reuters  on the latest developments.  One thing stands out:  the reference to "Islamist militants" instead of calling them "terrorists."  This may seem like no big deal, but I think it just goes to show that some people will never get it.
