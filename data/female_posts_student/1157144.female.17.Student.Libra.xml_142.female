While I was driving to your house I ran across 2 cops... one was using his front bumper to push a car off the road.  The other was trying to block traffic.  Hella cool.  I wanna learn how to push a car with my bumpa.  I DROPPED 4-6 SECONDS ON MY BREASTROKE TODAY AND STAND TO DROP EVEN MORE TOMORROW!!! WHOOOOO!!!  The coach working with me at the clinic thinks I may make CCS this year (if the Q time is still around 1;06).  WHOOOOOOO!!!  My car blew a tire overnight so I got to take the van out today.  I had fun peeling out of red lights and blasting KSJO full volume.  Good times.  I left the windows down on the freeway (MISTAKE!) and my hair went spikey and looked hardcore.  Laura comes home tomorrow... lets think of something fun to welcome her back!
