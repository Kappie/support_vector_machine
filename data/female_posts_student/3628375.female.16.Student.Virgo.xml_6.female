She's really starting to tick me and all my friends off. A guy friend of mine even offered to buy her the test and she still said no. Any words of advice on how to get through to my friend? Another things is she's been drinking alot even after she knew she was late, please anyone with words of encouragement!!!  Okay another friend of mine, *David* he has a problem accusing people of things. And no matter how much you say or can even prove that you didnt do the thing he was accusing you of, he still has a way of making people think you did that thing. It's really annoying. Any ideas on how to get through to him?      Well I have to go put my room back together now, so please right me back some comments, I would really appreciate it! Love ya'll!!!  ***We're not the brightest crayon in the box, now are we?***
