After only a few steps, she stopped and turned around. In her eyes was the bane of Marion's own life. Curiosity. "You needn't ask, I'll tell you anyway." Marion stood up, gracious even past the gaping hole in her chest. "You didn't realize, did you, that when you killed my sister, you killed my heart. It was dead, lifeless, before you stabbed it." Tittanya dropped the knife she was still holding, the clattering of metal against concrete drowning out the dull thud of meat landing. Marion laughed and picked up the heart that had left a bloody smear to her feet. "Are you hungry, or just terrified? Heart meat is considered a delicassy in some parts." The evil in Tittanya's eyes was somehow muted, making her more alluring than before, more human, more accessible. Then she spoke, breaking one spell while weaving a new one. "You don't understand what this terror means, Marion. You may be fuelled by death, but I am fuelled by fear. Yours may be the more powerful, but ti is also the most erratic. A sudden burst, then a fading away. Mine is ever constant and not only present in those around. I can use my own as you never will, for you are immune to your power." And with that, Tittanya harnessed the terror and ran faster than Marion ever could in her hungry state. Marion didn't try, she just picked up the knife. An instument of fear. An instrument of Death. And Tittanya's. The owner traceable through the object. "For my sister." The chase began.
