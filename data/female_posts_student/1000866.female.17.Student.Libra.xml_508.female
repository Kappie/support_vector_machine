I backed around a corner too, which I guess they make you do on the test. How dumb is that?? Seriously. When will I EVER need to back around a corner? Oh well. Today's going to be a good day. I think I'm just going to lie around my house, then Kathryn's tonight. That should be fun. This is turning out to be a very good weekend.
