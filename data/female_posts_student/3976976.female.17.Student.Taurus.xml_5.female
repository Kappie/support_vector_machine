If only you could view me from where im standing at  the light you've placed inside me  its here its shining bright  if only you could see this different side of me  would you come for me  would you put out the light  would we be happy  could this be right  could it go wrong  would the light quit shining  would the warmth be gone  dont let it get cold  if i let you inside  this heart  this soul of mine  i wish i could tellyou  tell you so much  tell you the way i feel your touch  can you see my smile  can you see how i feel  If you knew how i felt  how everything is good  would your heart come to mine  would this turn out right
