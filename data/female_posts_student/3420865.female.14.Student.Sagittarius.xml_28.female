"we used to do everything together... we used to spend our saturdays together, and wash our hair together..."-lora, trying to be serious in her drama presentation. it was funny cuz of the randomness.. me and erin laughed for 27348563 minutes.  "hhhhhiiiii."- danny, but you had to be there to hear the voice.  there was other funny stuff too, but i forget.  wednesday was alright... it was the last day of school  forever ...well, until september at least.  k so today:   math - did review... f-cking sucked, considering it was the last day and we didn't have a party. effing mr. veats.  art - got to eat timbits! (mr. olsen rocks.) and we had to fill out an evaluation thing of the teacher and the class... it was cool. plus the fact that it wasn't, but you know.  lunch - hung out with the usual crowd... went to richardson's twice. and stalked  r  to the  o  to the  b  with chloe... that part rocked.  geography - did another review test... i didn't talk to anyone/no one talked to me the whole period... cuz erin wasn't thurr. eff you all.  gym - did another part of our culminating assignment thing... then we did a warm-up, and played games and stuff...t'was cool.  ok so quote time.  *as i was quizzing ray for geography.* "ok soo... next question. what is a push factor? give examples."-me "easy...factors that make you want to leave your country such as high taxes, weather....and...uncool people..."-ray  "hey kate, is that your backpack? or anson's?"-mr olsen, pointing to my pink backpack. "it's anson's."-me "oh yes... i love the pink."-anson "that's sexy."-leif, anson's brother. "dude, that's your brother you're talking about..."-me "i know. but hey, i'm in love with myself, and anson looks like me, so basically... i'm in love with him too."-leif  "my daughter used to like raisins... but then she went to her friend's house who had a rabbit... she thought its crap was raisins, and she ate them."-mr. olsen  and last but not least, today:  1. exam this morning . (geography. so easy! frik i was done by like 10 (started at 9), and i had to sit there doing nothing for a half hour until we were let out. but yeah, i think i aced it... aha yeah right.) 2. took bus downtown with erin.  3.  went to wimpy's for lunch with erin . (actually, it was more like a brunch thing...had pancakes and some sausages. woot woot.) 4.  went to dino's . (for like 5 minutes.) 5.  took the bus to the mall . 6.  bought the new alexisonfire cd . (most amazing cd i've heard in my  life . wow definetely go buy it... even erin liked some songs.) 7.  went to the photo booth . (twice. t'was awesome, but the pictures sucked.) 8.  took the bus downtown . 9.  went to gateway . (the grade 8's weren't there, so frik.) 10.  took the bus downtown AGAIN . (erin didn't come, and went home.) 11.  took the bus home . (i swear i was falling asleep on it... it was kindof funny.) 12.  got home . (i realized i didn't have my key and no one was home, so i had to sit on my front porch for half an hour until my mum and brother came home. all i wanted to do was sleep...) 13.  slept . 14.  and here i am .  woot. so that was my day! it was awesome, but  really  tiring...  i have barely any quotes, cuz i suck and i'm tired. but here's what i can remember.  "kate! stop   farting !"- erin. on the bus. infront of everyone.. even though i really wasn't.  aaah ok i'm leaving now.  paice.  in a hail of sparks, and a tangle of wires-  everything went wrong.  kayte.
