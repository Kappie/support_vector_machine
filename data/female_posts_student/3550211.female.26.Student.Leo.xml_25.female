"it's biased, politically driven .." blah blah blah. NO SHIT. It's Michael fucking Moore. And he is a very biased man.   I am looking forward to seeing this movie. However, I can tell you right now, that the movie is going to frustrate me more then I would like it to. I only say this because, Michael Moore, is well, a little to extreme for my liking. Oh, alright, I'll just come out and say it, I thing the guy can be a schmuck.  It's hysterical, nevermind ironic, that his movie which is currently being debated and discussed on every news channel, played right into one of Moore's favorite motifs. Disney's refusal to distribute "Fahrenheit 9/11" just proves his theory about the suffocating power of big media.   It would seem that attempted suppression is a promotional must these days. Just look at what happened with Mel Gibson and his "Passion of the Christ," or O'Reilly's lawsuit putting Franken on the bestseller list. To quote the Washington post, "Now we have the Moore/Disney psychodrama. We have gone from the marketing Calvary of Christ to Michael Moore's Messiah complex."  Although, I don't know how much promotion this movie really needs. The public has a growing dissent for president Bush and his fellow conservatives. In fact, "Bush-loathing" has reached new heights. People are looking for anything to grab onto that will cater to their frustration with the current government. Democrats and others who find themselves more towards the left on the political spectrum have found in Moore's movie a passion of emotions that no Democratic nominee could possibly arouse.  According to a  urlLink Washington post  review:   Nobody raised a question about his film's wacky insinuations that Bush let Taliban thugs escape because of some previously concocted deal in Texas or let Osama bin Laden get away because of deep Bush connections to the bin Laden family. In Moore's version of Iraq nobody was hanging from a meat hook in Saddam Hussein's jails. Baghdad was a happy city where children frolicked in the streets until boom! we blew them away. The invasion of Afghanistan? That was just a cover for running an oil pipeline across the country.    "Conspiracy theory" might not be the right phrase, but it's the first phrase that comes to mind.   And the Democrates and the liberals are eating it up. I guess the usual arguments against Moore -- "that he's intellectually dishonest, that he's a master of the cheap shot, that he's a loudmouthed neo-Marxist boor" -- can be easily pushed aside when what he says, makes your enemy look like the devil himself.  Not to mention, after the weapons of mass destruction fallacy and the Saddam-9/11 fictions, a lot of liberals feel that it's payback time. If Bush can lie, then we will too.  I think the truth for any political party and/or political statement is never even considered. Everything has to be exaggerated and embellished. A lie covers a lie covers a lie .. Well, you get the point.   I'll have more to say after I actually see the movie of course. I did leave a link to the trailer in a past blog.    9:04am    UPDATE:   at  urlLink instapundit.com  Glenn Reynolds reports on how Moore's film is getting a favorable reaction abroad.
