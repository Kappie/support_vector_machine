Out of papers and broken knick knack'ish things I own I've now produced one full garbage bag. Another half bad is devoted to things I'm just getting rid of, ie. Garage sale applicants, those and the bag I made two weeks ago out of clothes I no longer wear. That means I have three bags   full   of junk that is never entering my room again after I take it out. The only new posts out there at the moment are my own. That  is severly annoying. I don't know why but they (or my computer) have taken away my colour options. I liked it better that way. I hope it's a my computer thing.   I'm almost done "Queen of the Damned". It's a good book but just like the other Anne Rice I read, "The Vampire Lestat" it is very slow going and in turn kind of annoying. When I say slow going I don't mean the story I mean the way I read it. I can't read that book in long bursts.   Bethie has JUST called me! I'm on the phone with her right now. YAY! I would continue but that's rude.
