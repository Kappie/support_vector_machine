Mike!  As I told Ky in a later MSN discussion--the wrong one!!!  OK, not wrong per se, just not the one I expected, and definitely not the one I expected to call  first !  We chatted for a minute or two before he asked if Tom had called yet.  I told him no, he had not called yet, and that left both of us to a moment of reflective silence.  Otherwise, though, the chat was great.  We made loose plans to meet up on Friday night at the Maddy for Ky's last night in the city.    The next night, Wednesday, Ky  Ames  I went to see a couple of the  urlLink Hot Docs -- Calling Nate  and  Being Dorothy --and while I was in the theatre I got a call from the very fine Tom!  He left a message, and it seemed like he thought I wouldn't remember him or something.  I called him back (vei excited!) and we chatted for a bit.  I told him that Mike had called already, told him that we had made loose plans to maybe hook up as a group again.  Ky told me later that she was really proud I was brave enough to be honest with him.  Meh.  We made un-loose, very real plans to do something on Saturday night!  Woot-woot!  In not-so-exciting news, I cancelled the High-Speed Internet I had ordered for Brent's house (but that we had never actually set up) and they told me that I needed to return the modem.  The modem is at his house!  Faak.  After much deliberation, I called him.  It was really, really awkward.  I told him what I needed.  He said he'd bring it by on Friday after work.  OK, sure.  Yeah, not sweating at all.  I don't know if I'm really ready to see him, I sure wasn't the cucumber I should have been when we talked.    It's been kinda weird lately, without Brent. To tell the truth, I'm  mostly  doing ok. The break-up wasn't a surprise, and it wasn't an unreasonable thing for him to suggest. We've had a lot of ups  downs in the last year, and in retrospect it seems like more downs. And it's not even just like we're taking some time. We have actually broken up, we are separated.  A lot of people have been giving me the "if you love something, set it free" line, which sounds kinda like a load of bullshit. I guess it's just that I really miss him, and that whole boyfriend/bestfriend dualism. Double-or-nothing.   I'm planning my life only a couple of weeks in advance now, which is a very  foreign thing, given that Brent  I were planning things years in advance. But  I asked myself the other day if the break-up is still a good idea--would I go  back to Brent today if he called me up? I'm not really sure, and that  hesitation is a pretty good indication that the answer is 'no'. So in classic  cliche break-up style, I'll guess I'll throw my hands up and sigh, "it's all  for the best," and just keep moving on.   Tomorrow never comes until it's too late...
