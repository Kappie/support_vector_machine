And he blames the British for everything from the AIDS epidemic to Iraq ( How he figured out that one remains beyond me...).  So England lost to France on Sunday in the Euro Cup and a bunch of the English fans came into the bar. To this dipshit's credit, some of them were real bonafide wankers. But not all of them.  I just didnt understand the sheer hatred this waiter had for the English. Until I heard him saying, "I am not serving those Brit wankers on the patio," in front of them. So it really made me laugh when two of them said they werent English and wouldnt support the English if their lives depended on it. So i asked them where they were from... "I'm from Scotland," says one guy. "I'm from Wales," says the other. They were just watching the game because they love soccer.  And this northern Irish dipshit had to go stirring up all sorts of trouble...Fan-fucking-tastic.  That plus an old guy named Don came into the bar and told me I as a real looker ...And i thought what he said was I was a great hooker...I almost choked on my sip of coffee...Great Weekend. Really.
