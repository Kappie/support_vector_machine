Had a great late night conversation with M yesterday. Wow. He is great. I wish I had met him earlier. I don't really know him well enough and I'd seriously like to. I am convinced that he's just an awesome person. Someone that would've been a good person to have in my life. I hope I keep in touch with him. I really really do, but only time will tell if that will happen. You sorta lose touch with the people you are pretty sure you may never see again. I don't know if I'll ever see any of my California friends again. It's hard to say. Anyway, I guess I'm gonna leave work and head on out to The Whisky. Adios!
