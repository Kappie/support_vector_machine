Then after we went shopping and worked things out.  Later on we went to Matt's party which I actually had tons of fun and found out that Monet is actually a pretty cool person like Chelsey said.  I guess I just was a bit jealous before and didn't want to try form a friendship with her but now I realize how cool she is.  We might all be going to the mall next Friday or Sunday and maybe have a slummber party with everyone again.  It also felt real good to gorge on some pop and pizza Friday - I haven't been all strict about the whole healthy eating lately but well I'm still doing good with that but well my Grandma made this apple cake and like all weekend long I have been addicted to it.  LOL.  I am like so confused for math though and have my quiz monday so like I might have to bother someone in the morning to get some help and well I am a bit confused about Chem but I think I did pretty good on the unit test so  *FINGERS CROSSED*  because I really need to do good since ya know the quiz didn't go over to well.  I have been studying social like all today like mad cause I have to write the M.C. and Long Answer test either monday or Tuesday but I think I will do it tommorow cause I keep thinkin bout it and it's starting to really stress me out cause I've got so much more on my mind.  And well yesterday night I went to go see Cold Creek Manor but it was just and OK movie but nothing too exiting and well right now I am havin' a big break from studying my social and listening to Hilary Duff - and man is she ever great and a good singer and yeah Chels bought her CD on Friday so we were listening to it then at my house before we went to the party.  And well this morning I went to Church and I always feel really good after Church and I feel I still have problems but I know in my heart I just have to keep going on.  And as Celine would say it "One heart you are following, one dream keeps you wondering" and it sure is.  Everything will be ok in time.
