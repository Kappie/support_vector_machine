Woke up with bodyaches, still I did not take any medications. I just took some herbal tea and drunk more water. Slept more than usual. Then came Sunday was suppose to meet reena at 1pm at City hall, the night before I took two biogetics, my mom's sore throat medication.  I could hardly swallow any water, because my throat hurts badly. Every few hours I would rinse my mouth with listrine.  One big full bottle, what's left is just 15% in two days. Monday meeting Reena at Tiong Bahru plaza to get back my business development surveys but fever came back.  Really horrible experience, I nearly had the impulse of drinking down the remains of the Listrine to kill germs. haha Just an impulse too bad. It still hurts now.  But I have no time to go to the doctors, due to the multiple deadlines by my two group members. Really headache............... At leasts I was a sleeping beasts from Saturday to Monday, was nearly sleeping 18 hours average.  Monday morning I woke up early, throat still hurts had to force liquid down my throat.  I slept less than 4 hours but I did not feel any tiredness, maybe because of my ample of rest during the holidays. Maybe later will go clementi to buy some off the shelf medications.
