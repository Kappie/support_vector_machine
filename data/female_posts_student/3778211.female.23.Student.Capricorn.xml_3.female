If I am to feel happy and satisfied with myself and my life I have to have some sort of addiction. It can be all sort of things like smoking, eating, reading love stories, training, etc. I seldom have any problem with going from one addiciton to another, which very well implies that it is a psychic addiction. For example I smoked for about a year, but I did not have any problem quitting it. That is as long as I had something else to be addicted to.
In the beginning of this summer my addiction was set to not eating, which after a couple of weeks went over in an obsession with eating. And for about a week ago I started to abuse love stories. I know, but how silly it yet may seem, I just can't stop reading. And as soon as I have finisched one book I have to get my hands on another one...
I don't know if I have the strength to break this cycle, or maby find some kind of 'good addiction'. But then, still I probably would manage to over do it
