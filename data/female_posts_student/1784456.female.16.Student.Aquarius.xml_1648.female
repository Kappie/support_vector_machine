Gyaaaahhh! *played too much FF10* The English today was slightly bearable *you wouldn't guess it from reading my spelling though* It's one of those subjects that I'm apparantly good at... actually, more like everyone else is really really crap at it so I look good. *sorry, but it feels more like that!* I think they should supply us with batons made of foam so that we can hit the desk/supervising person when we get stressed in the exams. Or at least supply us with mittens or something! I think my hands might drop off in a test someday now. *fun!* Free my pretties! FREEE!
