The Gang and I had to all get driven to the Brampton Go Station to in Toronto and find our way around Toronto all by ourselves. It was amazing. I'm actually surprised my mom trusted me to do that by myself. I mean, I'm an idiot and could have easily messed everything up. But I guess she knew that I was at least with Courtney who is, in fact: always the responsible one.  But anyways, we got to Toronto really early (okay, 8:30... not particularily early, but early for us) and no shops or anything were open yet, so the Gang (Courtney, Ran, Cordell, Kyle, and I) went to Toronto Harbor and hung out there for awhile. It was kind of nice if you didn't think about all the pollution infesting Lake Ontario. Kyle held my hand. My God, WHY is he doing this to me? Like... He knows I love him. And he knows that he's just going to have to break my heart because he STILL hasn't said anything.... So why is he doing this? I want to talk to him. I want to say something. But I just can't. I've done a lot of talking, he knows EXACTLY how I feel. And I know nothing of how he feels. Like absolutely nothing. I can't sleep. It physically hurts me. Oh God. I'm getting sidetracked....  We went shopping and made Courtney pose in front of Hooters. Which she did gleefully, of course. We went to a bunch of gothic stores that Ran ended up running out of. Then we went to Kensington Market and found a nice little playground where Cordell and Ran swung on the swings and Kyle and I seesawed and Courtney eyed us all like the protective motherly-type she is. It was fun. Kyle held my hand some more... And by some more, I mean basically all day. WHY?! This is killing me.  Okay, okay... Moving on.... Umm... We had lunch and hung out in the park and stuff which was kind of nice and relaxing despite the fact that I can not feel "nice" emotions right now and the last thing on my mind is relaxation... But it was good. I still haven't talked to Erin, but everyone says I shouldn't, and I'm not really worrying about it too much.  It's nearly 12 and I can't sleep. Ran called Kyle and he's in trouble,so can't use the phone and she was going to get him to call me. I don't want to talk. I'm really glad he's in trouble (not really, because I know it annoys him when he gets in trouble for stupid things). I just really didn't want to talk. I don't know what to say.   Anyways, I've bored everyone *looks around to see no one and cries* and myself, so I'm going to try to get some shut-eye.
