However, I had to be a smart ass and ask him why he wasn't dressed.  -- Of course, he had to be a smart ass back because there I was standing in mine.  I'm always in mine if I'm home all day It's comfortable and saves time on laundry... usually. But I do believe we need to buy more cloths.  I haven't really bought any in awhile because I knew I'd be having gastric bypass surgery soon and any cloths I bought would be to big within a week or so. I do miss cloths shopping though, that's on my list of things to do -- very soon!
