The quotes I wrote in everyone's yearbooks this year were "Everytime I close the door on insanity, it comes in through the windows." and "Stand firm in your refusal to remain conscious during algebra.  In real life, I assure you, there is no such thing as algebra."  What I SHOULD have put was "by the time you've read this, you'll have already read it."  I don't know why, but I just think that would have been so much more awesome.  Oh well.  Next year.
