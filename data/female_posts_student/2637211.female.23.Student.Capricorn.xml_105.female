As I was cooking, Melissa called and asked if I wanted to go to Woodstocks and that sounded so much better than my crappy meal that I said I'd totally come. It was nice to hang out with people I don't really know or really miss seeing a lot. Her friends Ian and Leah were really nice and cool, and it was nice to see people I barely knew. I've also been really stoked about seeing Melissa a lot lately, because earlier we... okay, I, was really bad at keeping in touch. I'm looking forward to going to a makeup counter tomorrow with Melissa too. We won't let the makeup ladies bully us! Oh well. After a beer and two manhattens, I probably shouldn't be writing too much more. Update tomorrow.
