The first, "In The Wilderness: A Black Church's Response to White Supremacy," will be in Waco, TX, at Baylor University's  urlLink Pruitt Symposium  September 30-October 2.  The second, "A Gospel of Respectability: Morality, Manhood, and Decorum Among the 'Better Class' of Black Churchmen," will be at the  urlLink American Academy of Religion's annual meeting  in San Antonio, TX, the weekend before Thanksgiving. Woohoo.
