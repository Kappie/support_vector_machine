You think Sioux Falls isn't much of a city?  Ha.  Just travel to the Westside (yo) and visit our friends of Rushmore.  Yeesh.  Talk about Hicksville.  Owen and I discussed today how all people from South Dakota are crazy.  No, I'm serious.  We are insane.  Yes, that includes  you  too.  It must be in the water.  Today was our last day there, and we ended up returning a day earlier than planned.  We went on the Volksmarch, which is where a whole bunch of folks (about 8,000.  I asked!) scurry up the Crazy Horse Monument.  It was so cool.  I didn't realize how amazed I would be.  I mean, you walk about 5 miles to this large mountain with a face carved into it, and it's the neatest thing in the world.  You can see forever from there.  I will put a picture later on.  I was thoroughly impressed.  South Dakotans may be crazy, but we live in a gorgeous place.  In other news, I started on a coffee craving as of 8 A.M. this morning.  My boyfriend (aka Caffeine Addict) would be proud.  Even when we stopped at this tourist place for lunch, I had their 5 cent coffee.  It wasn't bad, to my utter shock.  Anyhoo.  After that, Owen and I had a great time watching The Last Samurai on DVD   IN THE CAR  !!  How utterly 21st Century is that?!  I know, I know.  I shouldn't have ended this post with such excitement.  I'll try to dull it down next time.  Honest.
