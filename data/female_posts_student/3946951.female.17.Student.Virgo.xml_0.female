I recieved another  collegeboard.com  letter with specific information on how I did on my  June 5th  SAT exam. You know, stuff like which problems I missed, which problems I skipped, the problem difficultly level... And while I was skimming through this SAT  mumbo jumbo , it suddenly hit me that collegeboard.com is very, very mean. Ibelieve it enjoys  watching the profoundtears of  innocent  teenagers and listening to their distressed anddesperate cry for mercy.    I mean, really, how many lives are they destroying with this one exam, anyway? How many  dreams  are being squashed? How many times has the SAT exam kicked dirt onto the faces of dedicated students?     Who am I  ranting  for? I am rantingfor thestudents who had their goals set on furthering their education, but was never accepted to their dream schoolbecause of the stupid test they call SAT. I'm defending the parents of students who spenthundreds and thousandsof dollars on worthless,  excruciating  hours of private tutoring. I am defending schools who are ranked in accordance to how well their students do on a test that includes problems that will NEVER be applied to real life. Goddamn, it's enough to tick the most composed person off.    And you know what I hate about  optimistics ? ...This one, insanely redundant excuse:    "SAT does  not  measure a person's intelligence! Colleges look more into community servce and good grades and GPA--"    --and BULLSHIT!    Yes. Bullshit. That's what it all comes down to, ladies and gentlemen:  Bullshit .
