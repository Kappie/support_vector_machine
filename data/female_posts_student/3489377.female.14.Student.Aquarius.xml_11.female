He freaks out and yells at me.He found out today he had 80 something spyware. I understand that a computer is his life, but I thought I was more important..Am I? His loving girlfriend or a machine? He chose Final Fantasy XI over me yesterday when his mom was taking me home. Sometimes I wonder if he still loves me like I love him...And he tells me he loves me more. Im scared. He thinks im cheating on him again sometimes..*closes her eyes slowly* If he could just see what he does to me sometimes. Im sure he forgets. I know what other people would say to me right now, "You don't need him if he does that to you and you deserve better." Stuff like that, but..I love him. I always will and people can't seem to see that. I can take the shit he blows at me, not many can. Im a tough girl. I may act retarted, but im mature and smart inside. Im not a child like people say I am. I can straighten up when I need to. Yeah, I fuck up..I always fuck up, but im not perfect. No one or thing is perfect. Even if something was perfect, im sure it still won't be that great. I see nothing perfect.Straight lines aren't even perfect...This world, this world is filled with so many great people..and no one can equal up to him..No one. No one can see what I have for him, what I feel for him, what I do for him. Yeah, im still a little depressed, but it isn't because of him. Im scared to talk about friends of mine that are guys because he gets upset. I don't know what to do anymore though..I wish I could fix everthing..But then again, im not perfect..
