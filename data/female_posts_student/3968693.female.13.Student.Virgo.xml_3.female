I am back again!!I am in a much better mood now!I did'nt finish any homework at all because i am feeling very sick as well as complicated about what to buy for Janhvi on her suprise party this thursday.I mean there is only 1 more day left  i don't even know what to buy her as a gift!How annoying!Anyway,nowdays i have been noticing something very disturbing indeed,guess what?Arjun, our class pandit, keeps on staring at me all the time!Eeeeeeeeuuuuhhh!!!!!!!I mean i have been noticing this for the past 1 and a half months!!I don't understand his problem at all. Whenever i am answering or talking to any of the teachers or my dear friends , Arjun keeps on staring at me continuosly!!! This is becoming weirder day by day!Both arpita shivali are driving me completely nuts! I think both of them should seriously consult a pshyciatrist for their mental illness!!!!!!!!!They are becoming more  more pathetic and intolerable day by day!Anyway, i can hardly wait for jaanu darling's party and our school trip to science centre.I am just so thrilled!!I think i will buy jaanu darling a bracelet for her birthday as i cant think of anything nice and fancy yet.Raina cant stop telling me  ''give me a 3'' or ''give me a 7'' or ''give me a 1''!!God! Raina is totally insane but maybe that's why i like her very much!!!And on the other hand so many things from our class has been stolen recently.6 of my pilot pens  my chemistry notebook dissappeared into thin air!Can u believe it?Something is very fishy!Ipsita lost her expensive handphone yesterday at class  she also lost her biology notebook and maths worksheet as well.Raina dear also lost 3 of her hindi notebooks in the class!I don't get a thing.All our things just start getting lost in the class!!Very,very, very weird!The thing which i absolutely don't understand is that why in the world would anyone want to steal my chem notebook cause whatever i wrote in it was crap and it hardly makes any sense!!Oh yeah!Now i know why i have so many pimples in my face. Wanna know? It is because my beloved friend Ipsita,keeps on coughing  sneezing into my face directly all the time!!Seriously what the heck is her problem? What is so special about my stupid and ugly face?Ipsita Basu-she is extremely humorous,intelligent, friendly,crazy  interesting as a person.But trust me , sometimes she can become really weird like today all of a sudden she started to sing this really weird song to me into my ear just after English lesson, I was so damn shocked!!!But despite of her craziness, ipsita is actually a very,very nice,understanding  helpful girl. She is filled with joy  laughter , bringing smiles to all the people's faces arond her.Raina SWEETHEART-She is extremely talented,responsible,whacky,reliable,friendly  kind!!Raina is the best dancer in our whole school!Her dancing abilities are absolutely awesome!!!The best thing i like about raina sweetheart is that she is very modest,inspiring  cheerful! You can always go to her for help!Raina is our very own dancing queen. Both Ipsita  Raina darling are truly a blessing to my life!!!Even Janhvi is vey nice, friendly  helpful but her biggest backdraw is that she talks way too much of nonesense  she kind of likes to boast a lot.Other than that, there is nothing wrong with jaanu darling!Ramu is becoming nicer day by day, thankfully she has finally come to her senses at last!Except for arpita  shivali who are becoming worse day by day! Anyways, my pathetic dad is again lecturing me on not to waste my time on the computer. I just dont understand my parents problems, why cant they just leave me alone in peace?Why must they always boss  lecture me around all the time? Don't i have a mind of my own or what?! Nobody understands me!!!Nobody!Gotta go, see ya later! BYE.
