Anyway - went to library and now have ALIAS BOOK!!!!!!! WHEEE!!! And it's on for the first time in like a month tonight.   I should probably do homework, but I honestly don't. really. want. to....   If someone's life strikes them as interesting, please email me and explain. I want tips.   Brandon's Conquest of the World is now OVER. If someone would like a copy, again, email me. Or it'll be posted on my site when I get bored enough. Also, if you are interested in being in the actual PRODUCTION of BCotW... you know what to do. Contact me, Brandon, Hillary, or Michael. We aren't writing anymore, so don't waste the little brainpower you have in your skulls to beg us to. Although we accept bribes - even if there's nothing in it for you.   Alas, alas, (Legolas's first line in FotR, hee) my story is not done. MY title-less story. I'll just lament about this to myself while I go to church and listen to some lovely singing voices. Ta.
