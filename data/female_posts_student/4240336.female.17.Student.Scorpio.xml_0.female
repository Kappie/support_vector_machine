We're probably gonna get their around 3, and we'll end up meeting Rod and all his friends.  Which reminds me, I must tell Niki when the train is.  I'm becoming  very  paranoid over when this whole thing will end.  The last train is 12:37.  It can't end a  second  later than 12 midnight or we're fucked.  I just realized how else we'll be fucked since on the Nightwish forum there's talk on how the show is probably oversold.  It only holds about 1000.  If we get caught in the middle  A) that would suck lol   and  b) we'd be stuck.  I need to talk to Niki.  She's not online right now though.  I hope she feels well.           Anyway after that on Monday we leave for Massachusettes (hence why I MUST get home).  So I won't be updating for awhile.  I get a break from using the internet =D           Now off to find Niki.  We really need to plan this better :/
