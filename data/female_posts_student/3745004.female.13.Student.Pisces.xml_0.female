Coughing she stumbled forward leaning on a wall till the dust cleared. After the dust was settled, Hoshi looked around and spied on a stairs she never noticed before. The girl sensed a strange delight creeping up on her as she made her way up the stars. Something was going to happen, she could tell. At the top of the stairs was a small trap door. Hoshi pushed it open and stepped into the crisp night air. A movement caught her eye as she emerged. Ukchan turned in the full moonlight to see who was there. His body had a crystalline glow around it in the moon as her turned and his short blue hair turned to diamond in Hoshi's eyes. As he spotted her. The deep brown eye of Ukchan drilled right into Hoshi's soul as he stood searching her. The females min and heart told her to run to him, but her body didn't listen. All was still. suddenly Hoshi came into herself and dashed forward, her legs becoming weaker and tears streaming from her eyes. She drew nearer and near when her legs gave out. Hoshi started to fall, fall right into Ukchan's strong arms. Her heart skipped not one, not two, but three beats as Ukchan stopped the fall. She didn't dare move for a moment feeling she might wake from a dream if she did. Ukchan gently wrapped his arms around her and pulled her tight to him. Hoshi help her breath as she buried her face in her soft shirt and linked arms around him. She relaxed when Ukchan;s torso softened and leaned on his chest. Hoshi was in a dream like daze as her worries fell away. Squirming a little in the arms that help her firm yet gentle she looked up and caught Ukchan looking down at her with a small curved smile. She lovingly smiled back at him with teary eyes. Taking then a chance Ukchan leaned down, closing his eyes and met lips with Hoshi in a kiss so heavenly and pure that the world instantly feel away from them. Their bodies grew hot as they shared their warmth and seemed to melt into one another, Hoshi closed her eyes and started to kiss Ukchan back putting slender arms around his neck. Both felt as if they could stay like that forever, but Ukchan pulled back after some seconds. Hoshi opened her eyes and looked at Ukchan with the slighest blush streaking her face. Nothing in the world could have beaten that first kiss.
