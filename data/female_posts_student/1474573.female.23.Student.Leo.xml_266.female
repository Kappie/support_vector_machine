Okay, so I still have a shitload of filing, 3 Spanish compositions to work on and stuff to buy at BJs and all I can think about is "I cant wait to see American Idol and 24 tonight!!"  Quentin Tarantino should be a hoot since he knows too much about music and is a huge fan of the show.  I love it when I hear that there are famous people out there that are as obsessive about certain shows as I am!!  I know, I'm a dork.  Shet ep.  It's movie song night!  That means SOMEONE will sing "Take My Breath Away" and possibly there'll be a really bad rendition of "Gloria" or "Maniac" and then possibly, who knows... Now is it songs from movies, or from movie musicals? Because that would just open the door to so many hits like "Hopelessly Devoted" to "Rock n' Roll High School"  Either way, I cant friggin' wait!!  Speaking of music, I got the new George Michael CD (it's an import),  Patience  (how ironic) on Saturday and I cant stop listening to it!!  I'm so in love with him, its crazy!  So far I LOVE about 3 songs on it, and I like most of the rest, but I think this is going to be like  Older , it will grow on me...   I was talking about this yesterday to a friend of mine...the CD...it's kinda  gay , if that makes sense.  I mean, overtly so.  I know he's out and all that, but I guess its just weird for me to hear shit specifically being sung to a guy, even though I know what he likes... There's even a picture of his ha-cha-cha boyfriend in the booklet!  Call me crazy, but it's very hard to picture myself as his girlfriend anymore.  The lust is lost for him, but the love still lingers on...(as it always will, George.  I LOVE YOU!!!! MARRY MEEE?!?!? oh, right, I'm married. Shit. oh well.)
