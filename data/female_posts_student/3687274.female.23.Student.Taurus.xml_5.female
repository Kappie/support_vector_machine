It's just too hard!!  If there were no thai restaurants or cinnamon candies or sausage mcgriddles at Mcdonalds or pepperoni pizzas from Pizza Hut, I'd be thin.  And perhaps if my mom's side of the family didn't resemble hippos.  Those are the things keeping me fat!!!  I have to get away from them.  Well, away from everything but the Thai food and the cinnamon candies.  And my mom's side of the family.  I'm eating  one of those vegetable medley thingys.  It has broccoli, baby carrots and cauliflower.  Mmm mm good.   I wonder if my breath smells as bad as my tongue tastes.  All the people I must be offending right now.  Oh well.  But that's all.  I have a mental issue and I just wanted to share it with the one other person who reads this, Nikol.  Seeing as how none of my other friends can take time out of their busy schedules to look at it, Tammy, Tracy, Robin, Mike, Frank.
