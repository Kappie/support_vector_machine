Anyway, as you can see my IMood is "Bizarre"  I feel super super lousy/guilty/ashamed/horrible/sick/miserable but I also am feeling way more cheerful/happy/content/lovely than I have been in ages.  So I'm confused.  I feel good though! But I feel bad too... But I feel good! But I feel bad. But I'm oh, so cheerful! Then, I'm oh, so depressed and feel like I've made myself sick with myself. Now, it's happened before that one minutes I've felt super great, then the next minute I felt terrible, but that's just puberty, or I was feeling good but then something/someone put me down in the dumps unexpectidly. But right now it's BOTH at the SAME time. I'm not emphasizing those for anyother reason than I am hyper and feel like EMPHAZING certain words, but NOT emphazing OTHERS. JUST the IMPORTANT ones.  I hate myself. I love myself. See?  I've never said "I love myself." And I don't. I don't know why I said it. I hate myself. What was I thinking? I was just proving a point that I'm split personalities at the exact same time. I think. I swear I don't love myself, but I think I'm okay. But I don't like myself.   Yep yep. Loads of homework yet to do. I just thought I'd take a break.  Here's what's to be done:    Latin Translation   4 Algebra II Worksheets     I decided to just forget this, I'm not doing them. I don't care.      Much Ado About Nothing Essay Outline    Much Ado About Nothing Essay (Due Friday, so I should work on it some because if I don't I'll have LOADS of homework all week, because Mr. Murphey doesn't like me very well.)   College Report (Due Next Week, but see above as to my reason I should get some done...also...it's a big report...big grade...so I want it to be alright...you know?)    Read nonfiction exerpt on that thing on climbing Mt. Everest and two diagrams on two tragedies and their causes.     Read nonfiction article on beached whales and write, with detail, with facts from supporting text if the author made some people out to be villians and heros.     Yep yep. That's all.  As you can see (tis the theme o' the day!) I have done a little bit of my work. Go me! I rock! Whoohoo! I am on fire! I am TOTALLY slamming! I suck. I hate myself.  I might not do the translation and just take my zero 'cause I don't give a shit. Bad me bad me. Oh well. I don't care. Yeah, I do. But I don't.   Guess I should be going then...
