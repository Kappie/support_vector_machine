Im really happy that moms okay. The thing is...im staying for another night here. Which is cool cuz we're bringing out the tarot deck(yep tracy's into it) So yep...im so happy that i have an aunt or relative that wont lecture me on witchcraft but, makes it easier for me. I have so many new stories to tell now. I've been learning so much about my heratige that i had no clue about. But i knew about my great great grandmother(i think its 2greats) how she was cherokee indian and she wouldn't talk about it to anyone in the family. Cherokee indians had a nature based religion practice (Wicca)..so apparently i have Wiccan blood in me. Isn't it weird how alot of my family experiences things that no one else does and that we're all into researching religon. But we always come to Wicca. I guess its just ment to be or something like that or we're different religions but when we find wicca and research it, we always understand it, we like it and we keep wanting to read into it because it is so real. The only thing Tracy said to me was, be protected by the light. She said think of yourself as a star, your drawn to help people but there is so  much darkness around you. I told her i always go out at night to look at the moon(if i've been with you at night you'd know) but she said well maybe you want to be brighter than the stars that surround it and that is one of your gifts. ...she is very cool, but she told me that i need to pray to a higher beeing before i envoke a spirit or do a spell but i knew that i just, never do. Wow, this has been so awesome. I love this. ..my aunt is so awesome, and she'lll tell me things about our family that no one else in our family knows, well some of the stuff they do, they just wont talk about it.  Okay well im going to go so i'll post later.
