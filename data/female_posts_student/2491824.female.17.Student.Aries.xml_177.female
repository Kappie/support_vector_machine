Sweeet :) G said today that he hardly cares about the seats in the auditorium any more--they're very shitty-- and after  Mockingbird  is over he won't care at all because as soon as school is out they're going to start fixing it... ...Meeeeaning... A FOOKING DECENT AUDITORIUM AND STAGE NEXT YEAR! :D If you have never seen a show at Jefferson, our auditorium and stage are very pathetic... It's kind of sad... But,um, our lighting and sound systems are probably the best of the area high schools... Everyone one at Regionals was really impressed by them...   Oh, and I am doing something for  Mockingbird . I was going to do sound, but G kept pushing the date back that I needed to begin coming to rehearsals, so I said fook it... But now I am a...*drum roll, please*... TICKET PERSON! Whheeee! So, I'm working box office at the in-school shows (Oh, I know Ramsey is going to give me hell for missing class due to that) and I think I might be doing it for the regular evening shows as well...  I think I really bothered (that isn't an accurate word, but oh well) Corbin today (reading  urlLink March  19 and 24 posts and probably some others may help). In 7th period we had class in the auditorium as is common and I put all my stuff by one seat on the end of a row around some friends then when to the potty and when I came back Corbin was sitting in the seat next to one that I put my stuff by, so I if I wanted to sit by my stuff, my only option was to sit next to him... And, well, I can't stand that boy for several reasons... So, I kinda stood there for a moment and made a face while I pondered what to do... Tim and Kyle, who Corbin was talking to, gave me a weird look, then Corbin basically said, "Jeezus Christ! Just sit down! I'm not going to hurt you... I'm not going to try to change your feelings or anything... Come on, sit down.... I mean, you'll hug some emo guy that hasn't washed in 10 days, but you won't come near me who likes friggen soap!" Ah, Corbin, master of the rational and fitting arguments... :/ Then Dillon asked if I knew my cue to exit for his scene that I'm in for theatre3 and I said my line that I say before I leave (" I'm  going to a fast food place!") and he got excited or whatever because of how I said it or that I actually knew it and he was like "I love you!" and he kissed me.. on the side of the head... It was pretty funny... Then a couple seconds passed and he was like "...Did I just kiss you!?" hehe, Corbin has this complete "wtf" look on his face... man, funnny.... ..Sorry that was pointless wasn't it?  I need sleep.
