Life could really be tough under best circumstances, but what if you are to spend the rest of your days in a hospital bed, slowly suffocating to death as some fatal illness eats out an organ of your body? You find it pointless delaying the inevitable. You want a little help to end your suffering. Should it, then, be legal for a physician to provide you with such help? The public is warming to the idea of Physician-Assisted Suicide and for years, the society argues on whether it should be legalized or not.   In most states, including our country Philippines, PAS or any form of aiding a suicide is a crime, while suicide or attempted suicide itself is not illegal. Currently, the Oregon and the Netherlands are the only states legalizing Physician-Assisted Suicide, exclusively administered to long-term residents.   Still, PAS and other form of assisted suicides continue to be banned almost everywhere. The state and the church consider it criminal and immoral. Though conditions are still to be met upon conducting such kinds of suicide, the government still argues upon legalizing it. And today, the dispute over patient autonomy extends beyond the right of treatment refusal to issues of Physician-Assisted suicides.  Well, if making life-long decisions is not easy, then how much more if it is life itself that you decide ending? That’s something that is definitely more complicated, isn’t it. But the arguments regarding Physician-Assisted Suicide death arise from the fact that choosing death rather than life is sometimes reasonable under several circumstances. The main problem, however, is the entire constitutional complex itself, that not only criminalizes but also stigmatizes these forms of suicide. My stand on this burning issue is that these kinds of suicide be legalized. If are totally opposed on my propositions, then I would be more than willing to put up some information and explanations to back up my stand. Anyways, on a crowd of occupied people who could only care for their daily survivals, I’d prefer not to make this too complicated.  Issues on the legalization of Physician-Assisted Suicide confront the society with a dilemma on what side of the story they should stand in. However, no one, not even the society, could prevent people from attaining autonomy and freedom from every individual. I firmly believe that the individual has the option to die in a manner he wants. And in the case of a greatly agonizing pain with no chances of survival nor recovery, easy death with an aid of an expert is preferable, given the right measures and restricted by the limiting rules. I, therefore, call for a change in society that these forms of suicide be a feasible practice in the future: legal and socially accepted in a society of rational citizens.
