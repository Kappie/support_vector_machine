For not studying from chapter 4 onwards, i think it was quite good, 42/50. *grins* I did the "eini-mini-more" method for a couple of questions, and it worked for some questions! Most answers came from my travelling experiences, esp all those questions on Australia and America!   Im glad that the term tests have all ended. BUT, im still stuck with all my projects, another project discussion tmr.... dang..
