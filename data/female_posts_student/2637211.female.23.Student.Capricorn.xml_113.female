My goal is to have 5 pages done by 9:00, so that way I won't feel too guilty about taking a break for The O.C., which is the most addictive show ever. It's so much better than 90210 ever was, everyone is hotter and wittier. Not sure if wittier is actually a word, but I mean "more witty" when I say wittier. Hmm. Maybe I can begin a new word. Only I need your help! All you gotta do is start using the word wittier as often as possible. Just think of how much wittier you'll be. Oh yes. It's totally, totally good. I'm feeling wittier than I was 10 minutes ago. So many uses. Start now.  Okay, just ran spell check, and wittier didn't even faze it. It's not a new word, and I don't feel wittier any more. Just lamer.
