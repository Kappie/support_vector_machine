If only she knew... nah that would be a bad ting... i'l be rejected she'll feel guilty and the last thing i want is for her to feel bad... so I'm juz gonna keep my mouth shut and enjoy the moments i have with her as friends.... you know... that moment when u feel so damn joyous and happy cuz u'r with her but you also feel painful as hell cuz u know tt's the only type of moment u can have??? a moment of two friends bein together nothing more....always less..... It's like a blissful blister in your heart.... you know i see other people's blogs and they have so much excitement and colour and life and people veiwing it... i look at mine and i see sorrow, depression lonelyness and something pathetic.... but u know wad... that's my life.... so till next time see ya and be happy... cuz u have a happy life... heck juz be happy u have a life... i dun even have one... cept for her and the few friends i have.... friends that seem to be drifting aprt and gettin fewer and fewer.... so everyone else.... read my blog and be happy.... be happy u u dun have to write the stuff i write.... be happy u dun have my life... best of all be happy cuz u'r heart still allows u to... BE HAPPY  P/S: If u wanna know wad my title 'deep thoughts in shallow waters' mean, it means all these feelings ideas and thoughts i have those that i wrote above... is cramped up in me and i'm overflowing with sorrow...  and that ppl is another one of these deep thoughts that is gona cramp up these 'shallow waters' called HANIFF....
