Usually we do a bobcat run, which is three laps long to add up to a total amount of 1 1/3 mile.  Anyways the partner run is when one person does 1 lap, your partner does the second, you do the third and your partner finishes it all up with possible extra credit.  Extra credit is achieved by doing extra laps.  But I wanted to do the bobcat run, which gives you and automatic extra credit I started to run the bobcat run I did my first lap in about 3 minutes and she didn’t notice that I was doing the bobcat run.  So I dashed of quickly to do my second lap, did that in about 3:30.  When I came in at the start of my third lap Ms Jensen came up to me and started screaming like a total fucking idiot.  She was saying how I am being defiant by running the bobcat run.  I was just suspended in time I did something that I know am very happy that I did.  I went up to her and gave her my first lap stick (the sticks are like proofs of you actually running) then I started my third lap.  She said it was useless to run and threatened to lower my P.E grade even further but I didn’t care.  I just kept on running.  When I came into start my fourth lap Ms. Jensen said it’s not worth it and I left to do my fourth lap when I came into do my fifth lap I asked for the time and she didn’t tell me the time so I started my fifth lap.  She was screaming where do you think you are going.  But I just kept on running not looking back.  When I came in for my sixth lap the run was over and she had everyone go play basketball, except for me.  She dragged me up and thought I might recant for my actions but I was in rage that she didn’t let me go above and beyond.  I noted the fact that every other coach allows people to do the bobcat run and she honestly tried to deny that she has never heard of that.  She tried to lie to prove her point.  I stated that I am proud for what I have done, and that making me feel bad or just even punishing wont work.  I don’t care if I get suspended it wont matter because at heart I know that I did the right thing and not even bushes legalization of torture will change my mind about that.  So anyways she called my dad and spoke to him about my “rebellious” behavior. After that she asked what my punishement should be and I almost started laughing.  Why would you ask the accused what their punishment should be?  I started to say I don’t know I’m not the teacher in front of her, and boy did she get mad.  Luckily the bell rang and I was free from her grasps for now.  My next class was bobcat time and boy was that stupid, you sit there and read for 45 minutes in your homeroom class.  At least my friend was in my homeroom class.  I guess I should call her a girlfriend, but I have not asked her out.  But we talk and are friendly towards each other.  At lunch I had to go do a makeup bobcat run, which means I ran another mile and a third.  After that I went to my friends and we started playing Dungeons  Dragons (D) we started our adventure we only got like 10 minutes in before the bell for last period struck.  I had band last period today and we only played for 45 minutes out of a 90-minute period.  I read my Dungeon Masters Guide since I was the Dungeon Master (DM).
