Last night I caught the end of Frontline's  urlLink "The Way the Music Died"  about why the music industry is faltering so much and why their sales are down. In a nutshell, MTV+corporations=singers who only look good and music that sounds like crap. I thought it was fascinating to watch, and it reminded me of why I absolutely love Frontline. It's a documentary of the news. It's always so current and so relevant, and really gets you thinking deeply about an issue. If they replay it on one of the  urlLink PBS stations , you should really try to catch it. Or just watch Frontline and PBS as often as you can. It's usually worth it, but who knows, I'm just a pinko liberal who loves thinking about the world around me. You might not feel the same.
