I actually remembered what I was supposed to say, though. The defense made me look evil and a little stupid, but that's to be expected. Good job, defense! And Kifner wasn't behaving  too  badly. I am a little disappointed that things will be going back to normal actually, because I loved the prosecution class. But, it looks like I'll have to go back the daily grind, and it also looks as though I should actually be reading "The Odyssey." I've mostly been BSing so far, but I need to stop. I have enough time to do it, I'm just too lazy. The laziness has gotten terrible lately, because my piano teacher had to cancel my lesson two weeks in a row. I really need to apply myself better.  When I got home, I realized that I haven't really eaten very much at all lately. So I ate my cheezits from lunch and am sipping the last coke from the fridge. My mood has definitely improved since last night. I was very agitated and preoccupied, and I was taking it out on my mother a little. She was being her normal (if you can call anything about her normal) clingy self. But I really just wanted to be alone, and that wasn't happening. She's like a dog. A dog who makes bad puns, and still hasn't gotten drunk yet. (Hahaha, that was the true part.)  I'm going to watch the new sbemail from yesterday....  Mmm, I might've thought that was funny last summer, but it takes a lot to really amuse me. It is very, very rare that I laugh out loud at something like that when I'm by myself. But if I do, you know it's good. Nowadays, I just watch the old sbemails every so often. I still have some faith in the Brothers Chaps. I mean, the response to that messenger bag was pretty cool. But they'll have to do a little better than that. I bet it's hard to make something funny without the usual gimmicks or gross/profane humor. That's what I admire. I mean, you could show your mom this stuff.  And this stuff goes right over kids' heads.  Although, Dylan's little brother likes to listen to "Strong Bad Sings," which I find absolutely adorable.
