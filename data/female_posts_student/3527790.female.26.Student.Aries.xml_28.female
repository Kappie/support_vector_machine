Then  I grabbed my bike and headed downtown. The day was a bit over cast but the weatherman was calling for sun with a few clouds and I was optimistic. The ride down was great! I just love being outside so much. Cruising no ... Flying down Mount Pleasant I was going so fast that tears were streaming out of my eyes and laughing with the sheer enjoyment of being alive and well enough to be physically active!!  I spent the day at Toronto Island. The Dragon Boat Festival was going on and I was there to support two of my friends. One of which is enjoying here first season as a paddler! And to make things even better I got to share her teams first win!! So that was exciting! My other friend is much more experienced and is was amazing just to watch the precision that here team had! They flew! It was great to watch.  I ended up hanging out with her team! They are a GREAT bunch of people. We ended up not getting off the island until 9:30ish and then went to Marche for eats! I didn't make it home until midnight!  But what a great day! There is nothing like living life!
