Give me a man with a beautiful voice before you ever give me one with bulging biceps.     *Although both would be nice.. ;)*  Check this out if you don't know why I love him. Copy paste, you know the drill. ---->  http://www.vh1.com/sitewide/videoplayer/index.jhtml?vid=19925=az=mraz_jason=/asm/adsetup/artists/az/=artist=true  Halfway Home -Jason Mraz  I used to walk along the opposite side of the road  ...and make others get out of my way I used to think I could sit and wait for the times  but they wont come until I meet them halfway I'm halfway home and I'm on my own I'm halfway there and I don't care, I don't mind I plan to leave here after supper time  that's when traffic is light, all I need is a sign and I'll be alright. I'll be fine I used to think that i could just sleep and then I'd dream And everything it would come to me Until I woke one day without anything to eat Lying on the opposite side of the street  I'm halfway home and I'm still out on my own I'm halfway there and I don't care, I don't mind Because it ain't my time to stay or say. I'll never lay down. I used to think that I could just sit and wait for the time But I know I gotta meet them halfway  I'm halfway home I tried home running with the flow I'm halfway there. Ain't it funny how everybody seems to care I planned to get there around supper time their serving up bread and wine All I needed was a sign and I'll be alright. I'll be fine. It seems to be a running theme about being fine and alright but I don't mind.
