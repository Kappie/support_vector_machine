As i sit here crying out in glee, my conscience says in a whisper, a very low murmur.... "where did it go?" Hmm. Good Fuckin Question!! I have no fucking idea. I bet a lot of zombies dont know or dont care to know, they just want to buy the lastest TV or set another forest fire. (Local camper my ass!! Fuckin pyros) Anyway, back to my topic, NO ONE Knows! Granted I dont make much money from being a total lazy bitch but I still have to pay my taxes in April and so do you little Zombie. Well, today I saw a perfect example of what i pay for. I was visiting Rancho Santa Margarita, CA and as i am driving up the local street, I see a traffic jam.... In a residential neighborhood filled with the Fuerer, (i will talk about that later), a traffic jam! I think to myself "OH No someone must have hit a kid or something", I see the Sheriff Supervisor in his big oversized polluting Expedition pulling up and as I get closer to the tiny intersection, I couldn't believe my eyes!!! It was Disgusting, Horrifying, I almost Cried!! Asbile comes up intomy mouth at the sight I see......  9 SHERIFF'S CARS 2 MOTORCYCLE SHERIFF'S AND 1 SUPERVISOR EXPEDITION SURROUNDING........ A PULLED OVERTOYOTA TUNDRA!!!! OH FUCK!!! THE HUMANITY!!!   No dead body, no gunfight, no hostage situation, or terrorist to be seen... You may be asking yourself, "is she serious??" Yes, Yes I Am. All that heat for a truck and a white guy who probably stole clearasil from target. There you go ladies and gentlemen, I hope you are slightly surprised or maybe you arent... Either way, I pay for the fuckers to patrol a city with no crime whatsoever and when an event like this comes along it's..."Fuck Man, I need back up!! He's got Clearasil!!" 9 cars show up.... 9!!! LAPD I am sure could use the extra bodies to help patrol their city or even the Border Patrol for Fuck's Sake!! 9 CARS!! and a k-9 unit!!   Well children I hope we learned something today.... You and I are taking it in the shorts... There i have said it. I want my money back you snakes!! Build another school or have a after school program for kids, anything, but dont waste money on all this "patrol" for nothing. It's Insulting!! does the gov't think we are that stupid?? Dont answer that.. Have a Wonderful Evening Zombies!!
