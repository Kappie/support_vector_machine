Three of them buried the other one...and gave her little piles of sand as boobs. It was pretty funny to watch. So, of course, we buried my brother. And we gave him boobs. It was pretty great.   Yeah, that was my day. I suppose I could go into detail, but I don't really feel like it. It was a good day, though.
