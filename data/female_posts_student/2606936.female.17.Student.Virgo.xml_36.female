I'm a horrible mean bitch and I don't even understand why people want to be friends with me."  This would have been a lot more effective if  a) she hadn't gone on to ask me to repeat myself twice(loud hand dryers, ya know). b) I had said it to the person who deserves to hear me admit it.  I have been having a weird time of it. One of my good friends' birthday parties (J) was Saturday night, so I slept over there. Problem? J's mom and the Schnig's mom are bestest buddies. So naturally J's house is plastered with photos of the Schnig. Let me tell you, you have not felt awkward unless you have attempted to converse with someone standing near the refridgerator while keeping your eyes focused elsewhere...... especially when they probably know exactly what's up.  ANyway, the combination of these pictures and our Mexican dinner (coincidentally, at a former favorite date spot of ours - kill me now) gave me weird dreams. Something involving bicycles and helicopters and shopping (at a Target outlet for eyelash yarn and lampshade trim) and coffeeshops with tall stools that someone fell off of. And at some point the Schnig asked me if I would please go back out with him. This caused me to burst into tears (in my dream) and tell him I had to think about it. I felt as though I was being inexorably sucked back into the dead-end relationship and knew I shouldn't, but feared I would.  I woke up and was actually surprised to realize it had been a dream  ANyway, I guess this refueled my animosity towards him. Yesterday, sporting an Audrey Hepburn purse, I got many compliments, especially from people who understood the correlation. (MY NAME IS AUDREY, dumbbutt.) ANyway, one of "his" friends complimented it and he was like, "I don't get it." I surprised myself by saying icily, "Well, hon, that's cuz you're stupid." I swear it was supposed to be a joke.... but it didn't sound that way.  Let me add that he has also been hanging near me wayyyyyy too often. I don't want to be his friend and he seems to think I've gotten over that. (And obviously I don't get over things too well. Tee hee. Bawl.)  SO today I'm walking to the restroom and as I leave class, HE'S leaving his class! and he's in front of me. SOmething in me decided to walk brusquely around him (slowpoke lazy underachiever) and I expected nothing from him. But as I'm just getting him out of my sight, I hear him.  He ventured a "hi." In a little broken baby voice, like he was afraid and resolute but still hopeful.   And confused and scared to death, I barely turned my head, then flipped my hair and waked off shaking my head.  Let me clarify that there was no one else in the hall and that he knew I had heard him. How rude was that? How awful was that? How could  I  possibly put up with that from someone? How can I possibly continue hating him when he speaks to me like a child defeated?  Why does he try?  And the scary question - will he ever try again?
