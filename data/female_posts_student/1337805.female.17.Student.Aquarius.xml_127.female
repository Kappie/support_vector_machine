Like my sugarcoating. I hardly ever show my emotion around other people, unless it's happy. This was the place to be different. I've been forced to sensor some people.  I've been told what I can and can't blog. I've been told to change how I act, dress, look, feel. I've been told I'm bossy and overdomineering.  After the halloween party, and LDC, I'm not planning anymore youth events for a while.  I don't know when I'll blog again either. I don't even know why I bother signing into MSN anymore if all I get is depressed.  See ya around.
