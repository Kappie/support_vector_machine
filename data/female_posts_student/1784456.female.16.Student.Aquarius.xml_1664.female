On to things that are slightly more interesting *this is our first meeting, I don't want to go too far* Does anyone know where you can buy the Ghost Busters sheet music from? Ahh ebay search! *random music plays in the backround as you edge towards the exit* I'm just bored. There's only so much enjoyment you can get out of singing along with Roy Orbison. WOWWWW! You can BUY the GHOSTBUSTERS PROTON PACKS!!! My god, I've been living in the dark for so long! *needs to get the courage to use mIRC or find a dark chat room*
