All of my classes were boring until we got to 4th and 5th period.  4th period Aerobics, we had fitness testing which was extremely amusing.  5th period BCIS, i finished my project a day early and then sat there and listened to music the entire time.  It was cool.  Mr. Phillips was really funny because he couldn't figure out how to put on my headphones to listen to my recording.  It was great.  And me and Kate made jokes about orgies in the back of the computer room.  Thats what happens when you're really super bored in BCIS.    Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: four words - die ugly jacket die.  I've decided that i'm going to go see Miracle for my third time, sometime this week.  Lauren said if me and Brittany go on Valentine's day, people will think we're lesbians.  I thought that was really funny.  Maybe we could attract guys that way......lol britt are you up for it? it'll be one of the best performances of our careers.  oh yeah, i decided that the whole incident with those Flower Mound wrestler guys was the ABSOLUTE WORST performance of my career....EVER.  Jess and Britt won't let me live it down....and jess wasn't even frickin there! lol, oh well.    Me, Jess and Britt went to Quizno's today and i told Tom (Jess' bf) that he flat out couldn't come.  i knew he was thinking about asking and i cut him off.  There were so many hot guys that came into Quizno's today!!!  And we're sitting there trying to talk about girl stuff and all these guys keep walking in!  We said alot of stupid things and made alot of funny jokes.  My personal fave was the one about the popup spam in our brains when Britt said the word "penetrate".  "i need spybot for my brain!!!!", lol britt!  good times you guys.  oh yeah and we discovered how much Jess owns Tom.  Its great!  gotta go study for geometry now.....yeah, like thats actually going to happen.....  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~
