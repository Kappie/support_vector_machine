I am going to miss my history class but I suppose that is the price of being done for the semester!  Okay, enough of the rant.  I should say that I have applied Matt and I for Tarleton University and am just waiting to hear back.  When I know if we’ve been accepted, I’ll let y’all know. Honestly I am pretty excited about the prospect of going to a University, finally.  Maybe then I’ll feel like I am finally getting something done.  I still have a long way to go, Matt will probably be done –at least with his bachelors- before I am!    Sometimes I worry that I am already 26 years old.  I am still in school and will be for a long time.  Okay, I am not quite 26 –as my birthday is not until July- but close enough… I am going to be 30 years old before I get out of college.  Then, sometimes, I think who cares how old I am?  It’s never too late, and you’re never too old, to get your education.  What matters is that I am finally doing it.  Still, I would like to be on with my life, ya know?  So to make a long story even longer, it looks as though we may be moving at mid August and throughout September.  Why don’t we just move in August and be done with it, you ask?  Well, there’s this little problem about out lease.  It doesn’t expire until the end of September, which makes it very difficult to move.  I wish now that we hadn’t renewed our lease.  Oh well…   So that’s all I have to say for now.  I hope everyone is as Jim-dandy and I am right now.  If you’re not, well cheer up, life could be a whole lot worse!
