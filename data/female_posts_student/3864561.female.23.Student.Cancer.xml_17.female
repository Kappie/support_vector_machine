Now I freely admit that my interest in the opposite sex - not least older men such as  urlLink him  (35),  urlLink him  (39),  urlLink him  (43) and even, in honour of the Olympics,  urlLink him  (54) - has escalated somewhat out of control over the past few months (thankfully Rob is very understanding; he knows that the particularly unattractive combination of excess weight and mood swings means that even if I did want to cheat on him - which I don't - I wouldn't get any takers anyway, so he just ignores me when I go off on one), but Quincy? Jack Klugman was aged almost 60 during the time he played the role, making him old enough to be my grandfather. I mean, there's older and there's OLDER.
