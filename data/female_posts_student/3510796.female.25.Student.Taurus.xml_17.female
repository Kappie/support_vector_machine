One of those stress headaches that just lingers has permeated my skull, taken up residence in my forehead, and has let me know that it plans on being there for awhile.  I spent my day off running around doing errands and grocery shopping, and my evening (and some of the morning) has been spent with my eyes plastered on my monitor, doing mundane Photoshop work and writing raw HTML code as I rework a website I've been paid to maintain.  The weather is a mess, streets have spontaneously turned into lakes, and before it was raining today, it was the unbearably warm and sticky weather that turns my sinuses into a living hell, and, as an added bonus, makes every sweat gland in my body open up and start gushing.  The end result is the man that sits before you: tired and clammy, with bloodshot slits for eyes and a forehead that feels like I've been pulling a Happy Gilmore in a batting cage. Inventory is coming this weekend.  It's that special moment in retail where everything in your store has to be perfectly arranged so it can be counted by people with adding machines strapped to their pants who, collectively, have the intelligence of a hamster.  Hey, I can make fun of these people, I used to be one.  For what were arguably 7 of the worst months of my working life, I went from store to store in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs counting stuff with my mind as numb as possible.  I made fast friends with the only person capable of thinking on the same wavelength as me - and we both ended up meeting the same fate by getting fired from that job.  Anyway, I'll be working from 12 noon till 3 am on Sunday, supervising, assisting, and correcting this assortment of dopes.  Thank God for the overtime and the free pizza. As for the website thingy, well, I'm not posting any of the details on that until I've uploaded a somewhat-finished product.  But I will say this for now: talking with Grey is always enjoyable.  But talking with her at 1 in the morning when we're both half-asleep and a bit slap-happy, well, that's a very special kind of fun.
