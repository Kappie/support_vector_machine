It really is quite odd.  This all started my senior year of high school and has continued on now into my twenty-something life.  Most people by this time have had at least one if not many long-term relationships. In my time here I have had 2 relationships each of which lasted 3 months.  In California it was the same...only 3 months.  So what is this you ask?  Is this a case of Julia Roberts syndrome?  Ya know, after 3 months commitment seems impossible.  Well a few years ago I would have said yes. But as time is progressing and I find myself getting older I am realizing that a solid relationship, although not necessary, would be a nice touch in my life.  I had a conversation with a friend recently who told me the day I rang him to tell him I was in a serious relationship would be the day he would have a heart attack and perhaps even die.  This didn't upset me, because he's been saying this since we were 13, but it did get me thinking.  And thinking is all I have done since.  Perhaps it isn't me at all who is the one phobic of commitment but instead the roll is reversed.  It could also be that in the last 4 years I haven't lived in one place longer than a year without getting up and moving out.  So that could be part of it.  No matter what the reason, its quite wired.  The day this 3 month curse expires will be a happy day.  But until then it is back to life as usual.  Keeping busy and making and maintaining friendships.  Its a good thing I am content being single.  :)  Well there is my random venting.    2 weeks and counting till the marathon.  Dear Lord!  I am nervous already.  Pray for good weather (no rain) it will make the run much more enjoyable.    Well this is me signing off!  Thanks for reading!
