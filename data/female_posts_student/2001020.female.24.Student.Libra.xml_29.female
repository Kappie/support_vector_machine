I had the worst 4th of July yesterday that I've ever had...I cruised around looking for something to do, trying to get a hold of friends on their cell phones who were already out and having a great time, and I ended up seeing sporadic fireworks from my car and watching everyone else stumble around drunk in Newport Beach. Fuck that shit. GEEZ! Just when I feel like this is my life, I get proven wrong with no fun plans with no one! Fucking balls! Not sure what the rest of my weekend holds in store for me, but at this rate, looks like I'll be spending a lot of time alone. Fuck this shit! I hate this! M's parents are out of town in England for awhile, which means he has the house all to himself...I fucking wish he'd call me up. Every time he mentions it to me, he always says, "I'll be allllll alooooooone," in that tone of voice that makes me think I should hope for something. However, my brain seems to know better from experience that I should never believe what he says until he puts his money where his mouth is. Tuesday night he said we'd hang out this weekend, but I don't see it happening. I don't know, I'm not going to hold a knife to his throat. I leave in a little over two fucking weeks. So if he doesn't have any incentive to see me, then I don't give two shits about seeing him. Whatever. I'm gonna try to sleep this depression off. The sun's not out today, which makes this a great day for sleeping. I'm not the least bit disappointed, because the sunny days in California are a dime a dozen, so there's cause for celebration when the sun isn't shining. Good night/day/afternoon, whatever you call it when you take a midday catnap.
