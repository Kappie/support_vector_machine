I want you to pull me from my bed of thorns an d reawaken the spirit within me I want you to take me away show me the atmosphere you travel the hillsides strewn with flowers that you walk show me how to live again  You're long overdue here Will you ever come?? Are you just an image created by this foolishly hopeful mind?  I whisper, "every noise I hear I think it's you every breath I take I take for you but it's not enough to bring you back to me..."  Day fades to night stars spill across an otherwise empty sky as the fermament bleeds fire  I lift myself from among the roses look upon this emptiness that has been my prison and I think of you...  I pull a scarlet blossom and crush it in my hand let the petals complete there soft descent and slowly hit the ground  I turn my back nd leave these ruins with only a scar on my side left to remind me of my Waiting.
