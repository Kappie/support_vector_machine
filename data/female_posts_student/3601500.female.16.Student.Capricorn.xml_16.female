So, I won't be driving this weekend either... -_-  I'm bored, so I'm going to list all my friends and stuff. o.-  Isabelle: My best friend, who've I known since 9th grade. We met in English class, when we had to pair up with someone. She tapped on my shoulder (sitting behind me) and asked if I wanted to be with her. I said yes, and later on when I was walking after school she ran up to me (I was surprised), so we talked and walked home (we live in the same neighbourhood). We became best friends quickly, and it's thanks to her I like the show Buffy and Angel (really, I like Spike) - she's obssessed with them (and Alyson Hannigan)! She also loves wolves, for some reason, and reads avidly the books my sister wrote (but didn't publish yet) - which is weird, because they contain shounen-ai and she's far from being a fangirl. Either she likes something, or she doesn't - she doesn't give out her opinion, never cries (in people's presence anyway) and refuses to tell me who she got a crush on! She likes reading (Buffy books, V.C. Andrews, Harry Potter...) and is the best in math (she got 95% as a final grade). She is very stubborn and doesn't like large group of persons, so whenever our group of friends go out she doesn't come. Our only outside activities consist of biking (to actually get somewhere quicker), swimming (at her sister's house), shopping, or going to see a movie (she doesn't like science fiction like LOTR, yet loves HP - very picky, even with her food). She's got two older sisters (they all look alike), who are 26 and 29 I think, and who recently gave birth to two baby boys. She's crazed over them, and even puts 'Aunt Isabelle' as her msn name. Isa can be annoying sometimes - if she complains too much (the only opinion she gives), repeats herself (sometimes she tells me a story, or an argument, she's told me like 4 times already!) or refuses to do something (like go out or try something new). But apart from that, I'm over at her house very often, we understand each-other, we laugh and have fun, she's always ready to help me (eg. math). She even said she'd die for me. I feel the same.  Chelsey: A very peculiar girl, who jokes around and doesn't like a lot of people (I'm glad she likes me)! She's English, so often talks it, but her French is excellent (she adresses me in French all the time). :P I've known her since fifth grade, but at the time I loathed her because she was the teacher's pet (still sucks up, but I find it amusing - I also do it, but more discretly). And lets face it, she's always been a little annoying and sometimes doesn't know when to shut up (she says things out loud, so people can hear - it's embarassing). I restarted to talk to Chelsey because Isa hangs out with her. She's quick to fire up and says what she thinks - for example, when we saw HP3 she told the kids behind us ''I'm sorry, are you going to talk through the entire movie?'' (she can be quite polite) and they shut up. Another time, she told a girl, Caroline (whom she really dislikes) that she was stupid (I think so too), but at other times she's very nice towards her (even though she hates people, she still helps them out. She's smart and works hard on projects). Chelsey is nice and sweet, if you don't piss her off. She recently took a liking to calling us 'twits', and is the only one in our group who says 'fuck you' (friendly). She's also got a very cute brother... -o-  Jessica: Jess is Chelsey's best friend, and they're both good friends with Tanya (see below). She's quiet, but very funny when you get to know her - she can laugh quite easily. Chelsey told her once: ''You're such a ham.'' Don't ask me what that means, Jess was just teasing her like she often does. :P Jess comes from New-Brunswick (like me), and of course we both adore seafood! She's got an accent obviously (I lost mine), and we sat together in 9th grade, in science class. I only become her friend this year, when we had classes together and she hung out with Isa/Chelsey. She wasn't very bright in 9th grade, but now she gets good grades, even though she's a bit slow (if we do team work, I have to tell her what to do). She's got a sister who's coming to our school next year (like mine) and supposed to be very smart. I don't know much about Jess... uh, her parents are lawyers and travel often, she lives in MV... ^^;;  Tanya: Probably the nicest person I've ever met, though far from being innocent. If she asks you what you prefer between fries and onion rings - better not to answer. Lets just say that once, we went out and Mel (her best friend) did a nice demonstration with her food. XD She graduated high school this year, and is going in Physics at University - she's an elite student, top of the school. She does tutoring inside and out of school, always helpful and wearing a smile. I only became her friend recently, when we begun hanging out a little because Chelsey, Jessica and Isabelle are all her friend! She has a brother, Dabid, who's smart but not particuliarly cute - I'd go out with him, though; David speaks mostly to Chelsey (and Jess since they hang out). I really admire Tanya, she's very easy to make friends with...  Sandra: A friend whom I talk to and get along with, but I don't know much about. She has a little sister (who's in 9th grade). That's about all I know, lol! Really, we don't talk often because we don't have classes together, and usually my other friends are there so we group-talk. We talk about class and all, mostly. :P
