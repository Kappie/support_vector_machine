As a former leasing agent, I too had to deal with my fair share of ethical responsibilities.  It definitely is not in my nature to try to sell a false product by lying to prospects, their friends, and their families.  It was my responsibilty to show prospects our model apartment and our amenities. I was always asked whether or not certain items came with the apartment and how safe our property was. I answered their questions to the best of my abilities, and if I didn't have an answer for them, I told them I would be more than happy to get back to them on it. I have been around other leasing agents who have blatantly lied just to get the prospect to sign at my complex or one of our sister properties. When I have a prospect willing to sign their lease with us, the majority of the students do not read the leases thoroughly. Since I noticed this trend, I basically hit all the most important details in the lease so they wouldn't be surprised about anything when they actually move in. Some of the prospects complained that our price was out of their range, but I let it be known to them that if they signed at a conventional apartment, they would probably wind up paying more because they will have to pay extra for electricity, water, cable, internet service, etc. Our facilities includes all of those, plus much more. If I didn't get them to sign with us, at least I knew I gave it my best and I could sleep better at night knowing that I did my job in an ethical manner.  On a brighter note, I saw Shrek 2 on its opening night. My boyfriend and I thought it was better than the first one and we wouldn't mind seeing it again. Puss in Boots was definitely one of the best characters (Donkey wins hands down)!! I can relate to Puss because I know how to make people believe that I'm innocent.....and Puss is tiny just like me!! :-)
