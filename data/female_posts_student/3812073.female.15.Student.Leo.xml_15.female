I LOVE this GIrl!!! says:   if i love u i will let u go no matter how diff it is don't worry i will be fine...    I LOVE this GIrl!!! says:   really   I LOVE this GIrl!!! says:   don;t worry spread your wings and choose your path, i will support you fully     somehow i feel like i have  hurt a particular loved one.  i love her and respect her from my bottom of my heart. honestly i do, perhaps the choices i am going to make have to have her in consideration. i love you, mrs oon.   i ought to count my blessings. having several friends who pledged to be by me always, i know i'm lucky. joshua, my guides sisters. i don't know about the others.. although the unexpected happens when you expects least.  I LOVE this GIrl!!! says:   don't worry of wat i want... like i say i love u enough to let u go      friendship takes time to cultivate and time to grow . perhaps i am asking too much from people who are unable to give me that much within such a short period of time.   vanessa! i really love you and i'm willing to give you time. though i hope something will work out from it. i hope there will be a time where i can read your thoughts without listening to your words, to be able to be truly myself.  I LOVE this GIrl!!! says:   I know we share a special bond and nothing will change that         i am not alone... am i?
