On the way back I was driving along Theiss Mail in front of doerre and spotted an animal in the middle of my lane. With my lightning quick reflexes I slammed on the brakes and maneuvered the car out of the path of the animal while not going into the ditch. My tires slid well past the where the little guy should have been but I didn't feel or hear a thump. I opened my door and looked back on the pavement and saw a big raccoon writhing on its back in a small spatter of blood. I assumed I'd made contact with the unlucky bastard and he must be in pain so I pulled into a driveway and assessed the situation. I figured I could run over it again at speed and try and kill it but I'd have to hit his head. I also had the .22 and some rounds in the trunk so I thought I could just shoot it. I called my dad and he frowned upon the gun idea, since there was a steady stream of traffic. He advised me to just leave it there to die in the street. By now Ricky Raccoon had gotten to his feet but wasn't moving out of the street. It appeared the only part or parts of him I hit were his leg/legs. Reluctantly I drove home leaving Ricky there for dead. I felt bad about hitting him but he probably had a better chance of survival with me than with anyone else. I wasn't speeding and was paying attention so I had about the quickest reaction possible. Wasn't enough for little Ricky though. May my poor, fuzzy, mutilated little friend rest in piece.  Here's to you Ricky. WE"LL NEVER FORGET YOU!!!  Hope it wasnt a mama raccoon. Who'll take care of the babies?
