On our way to visit my grandpa there was this one house that just stood out. What they had in their yard was so funny that we turned around just to take a picture of it. We took the picture and then the little Korean man that lived there was like " Get OUT!" So, we left, not only because he told us to but also because there was a bunch of black guys looking at us like they were ready to bust a cap. I'll post a picture of the funny " yard art."
