But then I  "fell"  again. I knew I shouldn't have listened, I knew I wasn't good enough,  but part of me wanted to believe that someone actually wanted me.  Then I got upset because I want a boyfriend so bad.  I just want someone to love me  andbe there for me and give me advice and let me cry on their shoulder as they kiss my head and tell me everything will be okay. I want someone to tell me I'mbeautiful even though I sure as hell don't feel like it. I always listen to everyone talking about boyfriends and guys they like and how the guys like 'em back and here I am,lonely, as usual. Like I don'tunderstand whyguys don't like me. If you're aguy and reading this,pleaseleave a comment on why you or otherguys don't like me. Thanks. Butit's not like any guys read this anyways.  Like what do I lack that all those other girls have? Why can't youjust give me  ONE  fucking chance?There's a lot more to methanwhat you see. I only like being alone and I'm horribly impatient. And what's the point in being positive when no one's gonnapopup and fall in love me with?Anyways, anyonewho falls for mehurts me... Life isjust suchbull shit.Why are people hurt so much? I've been so confused lately...And then someone started talking about Homecoming. Uh... I probly won't even end up going. No one's gonna ask me. And there's no way in hell I'm gonna ask someone  because there are only two possible outcomes.  (one) they'd say no and I'd be really embarrassed and depressed (two) they'd say yes out of pity. I can't go to the dance by myself either because I'd just break down anyways and ruin all my make up crying. And I mean it's not like I'd look pretty or anything. Then the next thing in line to fall was something with one of my "friends." I think they are keeping something big from me.I sense it. And if they really are then great. It's just what I need. There's only one way I can think to solve this all but half of me knows better than that and the other half  just wants to make one person happy...     And here I am, a half hour later, still bawling...isn't this nice? Leave a comment please...
