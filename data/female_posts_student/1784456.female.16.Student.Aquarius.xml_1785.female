We were sat having tea and they ganged up on me, taking the mick adn winding me up. I got upset, went upstairs but my mum persuaded me to finish my tea cos she didnt want me getting ill again so i went downstair to eat it, finished and then went and sat in the front room with mum and dad. I sed 'Why are there Evil things in this house?' and my dad started taking their side, saying they are not evil and that i provoke them adn do it to them and that i get all that i deserve.  I dont no y but i just feel really down at the moment. Its probably the weather, and the stress and the fact that everyone is going away next week except for me, matt, dave, meg, claire, emily and emma. but chances are the only people who will come out everyday will be matt and dave, and i dont think i can spend a whole week with them. Its just not fair, i worked so hard to organise for me, samantha, emily and claire to go away, i made all the arrangements and found out prices etc and then they just gave up on the idea. o well, its not fair for u to listen to all of this. i'll go find somewhere else to rant at.
