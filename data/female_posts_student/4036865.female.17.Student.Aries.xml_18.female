Then i let myself in to my neighbours house (back door was unlocked) and woke Kyle up, it took him ages to actually drag himself out of bed, and then we went to the mall to check out the new stitches store, looks good, i bought some stuff, and then we had lunch together, which was really nice, and then we looked at video games at EB, and knowing he really liked this one game, i bought it, along with a player's guide. We went back to my house and played for a good 4 hours. By then, i was really tired of playing games, and had quite the headache. i did my nails, and my hair, and got ready to go out. Then Kyle's mom came over and we had to do the dishes, and walk the dog, being the naughty person i am, we only did the glasses at his house, since he always eats at mine, so why should he do dishes, and then while we walked the dog, i loaded her up with slushie. Finally it was time for me to go and meet up with Nathan, we met up and i got to go on his motorcycle, it was so much fun, a little scary at first, but it really was great. Then we headed back to his house, we watched tv for a while to kinda feel more relaxed, and then we did a scene. Which went really well, it was excellent. Then i got home and cooked me and Kyle food at midnight, and we watched tv, and played our game together. When i started rubbing my eyes, he put me to bed. i think thats one of my favorite parts of the day, getting tucked in, i do wish i could be held at night thou. However, that was my day, and it was good. Lets hope today is just as good.
