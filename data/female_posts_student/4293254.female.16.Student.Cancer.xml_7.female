It seems interesting the way Sofie called me a blabber mouth a while ago, and then wonders why she "bothers" me. I guess why Sofie suddenly comes to mind is because of all the people invovled in this situation I think she could be the one to "handle" it better. I understand where Drew came from, yes he did break a few bonds, but it's not like John didn't already know who liked him. It's rather obvious. The thing is, is that I don't think people realized how close John and Nicole were because the way everyone is acting right after they broke up is insane. I don't know this is just my opinion, maybe I'm rather confused. All I know is I care about John and I hope he takes his time recooperating. love,Nikki
