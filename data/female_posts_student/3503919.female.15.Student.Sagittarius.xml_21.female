But I dint make it cause I went to bought   batteries   for my precious mp3 .. lolx! Then we waited for another 198 to reach the bus stop behind the Jurong Regional Library so that we can take 176 to reach West Coast Park for the outing, BBQ that was held by S.H.E Faith ...  Not long after we reached but mi and peiyu was too shy to go over there as we dun really know them well ... So we sat on a bench not far from the BBQ pit and waiting for liwei, Christopher and kaixin ... We sat there for almost 1/2 an hour ... But the wind was so nice ... For several times ... The club members ask us over to join them ... But we dint...lolx ...  [*really paiseh lehz, to the ppl who came and ask us over ...]   Liwei they all came and we went to the BBQ pit there, they ask us to eat but at that time we was not hungry and went to stroll around in the park and then we also went to the MacDonald ... Very nicely built ... We went in and liwei ordered things to eat and I had French fries and apple pie too ... Went back at around 5.14pm and they had already started preparing and BBQ the food ... A group of gals came to us and introduced themselves to us ...  [*their name should be WeiLi, Joan, Emily, Christina, Evonne, WanSia]   They all are really nice and friendly ... And there is a guy too...   [*Name Eugene ba ..]   The ppl there are really nice but we dint really join in their conversation.. I wanted to help to BBQ food but there wasn't a chance for mi to do so .. I got helped but just fanning the food but there was so much smoke infront of mi and so I dint go fan the food but instead I fan the smoke away ... And yah ... kenna a guy say  " wha ask u go fan the food, but then u go fan the smoke .."  Pengz sia -__-"| ... No lah .. lolx !  We went off after eating ... Not went home but just gone to play at those playgrounds .. Kx and py went to climb the pyramid which I dint cause  I was scared  ... lolx .. and went to play so much thing ... it was so nice at there .. my mother called mi at around 9 plus and ask mi whether i wanna go home le, so she will pick mi up as she is on the way home .. so i agreed ... and also bring kx and py home .. while christopher and liwei took bus home .. We went back to the BBQ pit and guys are all packing up le .. we took our bag that we left it there earlier and drank orange juice ... and we went off and mi shouted "goodbye" to them .. quite embrassing .. i also dunno why ...  Went to mac and buy drinks ... walked to the bus stop and saw Evonne, WeiLi, Eugene and another guy which i dunno who .. they was taking bus home and so chris and liwei and them took the bus and go off first ... mi, kx and py waited for my parents at the bus stop ..  Soon after they came, first drop off kx first at the overhead bridge there and then follow by py ...Reached home at around 10 plus ... took a bath and came blogging ... wad a   long, tiring but fun day    ... That is how i had my day on 2nd June 2004 ....    (*Really thanks for letting us joining in the fun ... It is really great, thanks!!!)
