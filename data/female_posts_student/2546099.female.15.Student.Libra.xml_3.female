Sunday was my most memorable day of the year, my ballroom Dancing exams. I enjoyed myself but nerves almost got the better of me during my Gold Star New Vogue, luckily everything turned out fine. Everything except my teacher falling over in the last dance of the day, which was with me. Im glad though, bcoz he got right back up again and we started the dance again. This mite be a bit confusing but thats me confusing.I was so happy with my results and my partner, Jason's results. Jason was awarded the encouragement award 4 2003 and got highly commended 4 his silver and gold composite. I acheived honours in my gold star new vogue and gold standard (Modern). And a special mention at the end of the day by the judge from melbourne topped the day off. I guess u could say my dreams r coming true.  It felt really weird going 2 work last nite after such a high from sunday. I guess im still on cloud nine. Neway on2 sumthing else. Im really worried about 1 of my friends, i think shes depressed even though she doesnt think so. I wish i knew that i could do sumthing, i feel so useless. I dont want another of my friends 2 commit suicide. When she tells me about how she feels, it reminds me so much of me, when i sink down in that pit of unhappiness and the days r so dark and there neva seems 2 be enough life 2 have the hope of getting through it. Sumtimes i wonder y we r here, y we live through this unhappiness with only seconds of true happiness in our lives in the grand scheme of things. It seems that we live only for happiness and love, but we suffer through hurt and pain hoping that 1 day we can reach the ultimate happiness. Is there an ultimate happiness, i doubt it at least not on this world. Maybe love is wat makes us happy, the fact of having our heart sing and be full of joy when we r near that person. But with everything comes complications, reason y it cant work and last foreva. But i guess thats life and we cant change it.  Neway enough of my weird thoughts, unitl next time...
