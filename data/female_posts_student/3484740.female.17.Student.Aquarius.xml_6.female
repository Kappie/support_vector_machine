I'm just tired of him saying one thing, and not even knowing if he'll be able to do it, and of course, he can't. Don't say anything! Just say I don't know, because you really don't know. It's not very nice to make someone think one thing and do another. The fact that he hardly enjoys talking to me at all helps my decision greatly. I know that because of the way he talks, which he does talk about it. Which is also fine. I have a pretty busy life myself, I spent way to much time at the pool last night searching for my keys, which I did find, but I shouldn't have had to even begin to look. They should have been left where I left them. It doesn't matter anymore. I believe I have made a good decision, and I might stick with it, I might not. We'll have to see what happens. Thats all for now. Thanks for kinda listening.
