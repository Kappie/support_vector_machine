She sped around, forgetting about the trailer behind us that was being used by the men re-siding our garage. We almost cleared, but she smacked the right front corner into the trailer. Strike number one. A fewweeks later, there was a big thunderstorm. Now there is an evergreen tree right next to my parking spot in the driveway. This tree is three to four stories tall, and last year a quite sizable branch at the top broke, but didn't break enough to fall off the tree. So towards the end of school we had a huge thunderstorm. (I loved it I was watching out my window ofcourse) As I was watchingI looked over, and saw thelose branch of the tree plumet from the top andbounce right off the top of my Vibe. And I thought, well that probably wasn't very good for my car. The next day I went out on my way to school, and it turned out that I had a couple dents in the roof, my back windshield wiper broke off, and therewas a hole in my bumper. I was not please.  Now while I was in Pittsburgh my dad got all this fixed, and I was so happy, when I came home I had a car that worked exactly how it was supposed to. Two days ago I told mydad I was really bored, so he suggested I clean out the inside of my car. I said okay,(that's how bored I was) and when I was done cleaning I though i saw soemthing on the outside. It was a scratch. And it's not the only one. Apparently there's a dent too. I'm convinced my car was a horrible person in a past life. My car has horrible karma.
