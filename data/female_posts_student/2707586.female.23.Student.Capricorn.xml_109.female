My sis was there and helped evacuate it then she couldn't go into her dorm because it was next door and they were afraid it would catch on fire. So needless to say its been a mess around there and just the thought of my sister being there was hard for me.   Enough of the depressing... everone is getting drunk at the slumber party tonight except me but I am getting used to not drinking. Tiff do you remember the guys who sat in front of us at the Football games when we sat with apt. 245? They are here... or atleast a few of them are. I have a funny feeling that they will be crashing the party tonight but if I remember right they were fun so it may be okay. Have a Great Weekend everyone!
