After so long and you're still who I think of before I fall asleep (when sober), I hate when david doesn't win over the goliath (just say you hate me lots please, send  evil mail , i think that will help)  Angelica: Well is it love, big love, or great love?  Pete: What do you mean?  Angelica: Well, love you get over in two months, big love you get over in two years, and great love, well great love... changes your life. So which one is it?  Angelica: Oh my god, it's great love.  Pete: Yeah, that just great.   the movies make life seem so simple sometimes...  damn you, mocking me !!!  you'll always be my silver medal -  family guy
