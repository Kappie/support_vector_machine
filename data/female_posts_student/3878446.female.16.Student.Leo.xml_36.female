She took one of my smelly candles, like the ones you buy at a store and light to make your room smell nice. Yeah, so we had 15 regualr candles and then big fatty in the corner. It was nice, My party was so much fun! You only turn sixteen once, and let me say THAT is exactly how I would want to do it. I mean it wasn't antything extravagent, but all my friends were there, and we just had fun. Atleast I did, I hope everyone else did! There were a few people who couldn't make it and that really bummed me out, but it's all good. I went out for my birthday lunch today, we would have done it yesterday but there was so much going on. We went to Olive Garden, God I love that place. But I always get full after the salad and breadsticks and end up taking more than half of my main meal home. Oh jees, So yesterday at my party, two of my friends disappear, okay you'd think I would have been suspicious because these two particular people don't really like each other all that much, and all they had to do was run home real quick and then come back, but they were gone for like and hour if not longer. They get back, and I don't remember why but I went to my room   for something and I open my door and there is something sticking to my feet. I turn on my light and my room is COVERED in rice, jelly beans, garbanzo beans and candy corn. I mean it's EVERYWHERE. All over the floor, in my bed, in my pillow cases, in my drawers, all in my furniture, not one place in my room where there was not rice. Rice is not fun to clean up, really it's not. AND they hid two open cans of sardines in my room. I wasn't to thrilled about that on account of I have two cats. WOW, what a pain. Funny, but not fun. So I'm going to go see King Arthur with some friends today for ym birthday and then sunday I am going to go see Collateral with my brother for my birthday. My birthday so far has lasted 3 days, I love it! I got 75 bucks for my birthday from friends, and then 200 from my parents, I'm going to get my tattoo within the next week, so Michelle, you have convince your mom that I need you there! Tell her I'm scared or something and I need my best friend there! Right so I have to call Hoops to see what I need to do in order to get my tattoo and how much it'll cost, and all that, if I have enough money I think I'm going to get me nose pierced...no, just kidding I'll get my job first and then we'll see what their thoughts are on a nose ring...Right, phone, gotta go.
