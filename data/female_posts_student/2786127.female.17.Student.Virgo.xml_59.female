As stated in previous blogs, I DO have alot of self esteem issues, and my blog, for me, is a place where I write my feelings at the time i feel them. I'm not looking for you to say " Oh no Jessica, don't say that, you're beautiful, blah blah..." I write how I feel and I won't apologize for it. Yes I have some issues, with good reason assholes, clearly no one knows what I've been through in my life, and the few that do, I would have thought They'd understand a little more when someones self esteem crumbles temporarily.  And does no one think I've TRIED to feel better about myself? Does anyone really think i like being this way? Fuck that, I'd give anything to be happy again.  GOD, I'm so fucking pissed, can you tell?  And for the record, I am happy now, but everyone gets a little down sometimes, so get off my back.  *fumes*   I need to go calm down.
