Through this, i realised that i can't really make it through the rain all by myself... i still need help from my friends... need their luv n care to pull through difficulties...    Dory n i talked quite a lot today when we walked towards the bus stop... it's quite in-to-thoughts... some how see another persepective of life... n wat devoted means... haha... Dory is a very nice friend who nevertheless will try her best to help n do whatever she can to provide her service... ^_^ Thanks Yiting (z)... keke...    ~It is better to lose your pride to someone you luv, then to lose the one you luv with ur useless pride...~     Praise God!! Thank Him!! Let ur light shine for Jesus... ^_^
