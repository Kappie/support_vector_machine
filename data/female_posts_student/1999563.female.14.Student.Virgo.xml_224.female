I went to van mall today. annnddd I saw the BEST SANTA EVER!!  I got my picture taked with him like 5 years ago. He is sue-wheat. I bet he gets paid a lot. He has a REAL beard instead of all those fakers.  He is also really friendly, I wish he was my grandpa.  That would rock if my grandpa was  a mall santa! :D  I would be super happy!  I would sit on his lap and tell him everything I wanted.  :D  I would like to take this moment to thank Shannon for her wonderful blog post. And because I loved it soooo much I want to post it here for allmy friends to see. (I hope its ok with you Shannon!)  Here is Shannon....  Everyday at 8 minutes after 2 the big orangish-yellowish bus pulls out from my school. Bus # 52 that carries all of us students back to our homes to change into our pajamas and put on our slippers. I know where each person gets off and when we will stop next. At the fourth stop we end up at a little rickety house right off of St.Johns. A brown torn up house that I am assuming a very happy old couple lives in. The yard isnt done and the lawn isnt mowed...There is a huge overgrown tree covering the house that I am sure screams loudly during windy storms. But amongst all of the clutter and behind all of the mess...there is still, even in the first week of December, a tiny pink flower peeking our from beneath the corner of the fence. And everyday when we get to that stop there is a little soft golden retriver puppy head poking out from the top of the fence. Huffing the air and watching as the bus begins to roll away. Everyday, no matter how cold or lonely...warm and happy..no matter the mood or the people I am thinking about....I can always count on that puppy to be there to make me smile. I can always count on him to be there...even if there isnt anything else to count on   I LOVE THAT!  You rock Shannon.
