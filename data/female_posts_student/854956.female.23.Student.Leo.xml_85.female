I'm still going to have like, my little froggies dancing, etc.  BUT, the background and all HAS to change.  I've collaborated with Ricky (the HTML genius) and I decided on a new template.  It's so pretty....!  Be on the lookout.  Now I'm going to go and take care of the new fishies we got today (since one of our other schoolers died) and later I'm going to plant my plants in the UTSA colored pots I got... (an orange one and blue one).  Yay... I'm so happy!!!  I missed planting stuff... flowers are wonderful.  I also have to wrap Trinity's birthday gift.  I think this is going to be a good weekend... and then my brother's coming on Thursday... and he's going to pick out an engagement ring for his soon-to-be fiancee!  So much stuff is going on in my life right now..!!!
