I hope its not one of those things someone gives you and youre like "OH, this is....cool. I think ill go hang it on my wall cause its....cool. Why did you buy me this?" But its a comic so maybe hell want to read it? or like it? Poop. Everyone, read his highly offensive blog- wyrmwood.blogspot.com. WHATS THAT "LITTLE ..." GODDAMN! i mean... im not frustrated.... grrrr.....  Chimney! chimney chimney chimney! Chimneys are useless. And nobody has chimneys anymore and nobody has chimney sweepers to clean out their chimneys. And santa cant come squeeze down your chimney to bring you pretty things. So maybe we all should get chimneys back.  Anyway. Rant is over. I'm tired. My tummy hurts.   EVERYONE GO TO THE KINETICS AND PAGE ME AND MEET ME! 897 1178    abby
