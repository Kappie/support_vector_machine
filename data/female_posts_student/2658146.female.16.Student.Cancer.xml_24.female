Everyone has to know what I'm doing, what's wrong with me, how they can help, who I like, who I don't like, what I'm doing next Tuesday, and so on and so forth. Dammit, can't people just leave me alone and let me solve my own problems? Has it ever occurred to anyone that if I wanted help I'd just  ask ? What a novel idea! Too bad a lot of people I know are complete MORONS.  I don't trust anyone anymore. I have no reason to. Except Monica. I've known her for a very long time (what most would consider too long), so I have to trust her. But I don't have the capacity to trust anyone else anymore. I'm sick and tired of having to deal with people, especially ones I wouldn't have to deal with if it weren't my affiliation with some common person. I'm tired of being toyed with. I'm tired of all of these "friendship rings" and all the drama created by them. That's one of the many reasons I left Lindsay. I was sick of the shit. And I'll tell you something, I won't get used to it. Why won't anyone just leave me alone?!   Current Mood:  ANGRY! GRRR!!!
