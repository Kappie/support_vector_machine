But that's what I get for refusing to wear sunscreen!), wander around the riverwalk, shop a little, etc. It was just cool- but I seriously missed being around this past weekend! Oh well... whats done is done. Anyways, so camp is coming up... and apparently I am going- Johanna is awfully persuasive!! (there were threats!!) :-) Lol- not really, and besides I do wanna go.. I think it'll be a cool time.   Ahhhhh, summer!! I'm loving it! Everything is going so well! I mean, just everything in my life is finally all falling into place at the right time- Jesus, You are so awesome!!Thank you for all that you've taught me in the last couple of weeks and thank you for the people I've met and the places I have gone. Help me to keep growing in you!   I think that the whole patience thing is really coming along well- He is teaching me and for once I am acutally getting what He's trying to do! Not that I think that I totally understand the mind of God or anything but yeah- I think I am understanding what He is doing individually in this area of my life. And if I do say so myself, the growth lately has been fantastic! Ahhhh- I'm feeling His presence and it is awesome!  Anyways, Mario- I know you probably dont read these but...... I am so gonna call you UTURN forever!!! And there is no way I am going to tell you what I got you from San Antonio-- you'll just have to wait! Leslie- girl, only 5 days left! HA ha ha... and camp is going to rock! Mario, I can't believe you cant go! You're so going to miss out!! Lol- Kait, San Antonio was tooooooo crazy- we should do that more often!  Ahhhhhhh I am tired... worked way tooo long today- need sleep! I'll let yall know more later! :-) Tee hee hee!
