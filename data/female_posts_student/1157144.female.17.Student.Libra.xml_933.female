Warm winter ones, hair scarves, neck scarves, any scarves! 2) Cool pins/jewelery/belt/whatever. Handbags or socks or bracelets; just as long as it's cute, I'll dig it! Yea, I am super vague. 3)Just like everyone else, I too want the new Coheed and Cambria cd so I can sing along in a high pitch. CDs are going to be my demise. You all know I would love more of them... particularly...:  The Dismemberment Plan-! or Ice of Boston Modest Mouse- the fruit that ate itself Pretty Girls Make Graves- New Romance  4)If you are unoriginal or completely at a loss: Gift Certificates for cd stores, Starbucks, or Urban Outfitters would do the trick. 5) Super cool aqua eyeshadow, yo!  Sorry I wrote so much...!!
