I tried to picture myself driving to work and all that kind of stuff.  I couldn't though.  Sure I pictured a car driving to a building.  Of course I was driving a Range Rover.  Then I tried to picture my home.  If any of you have seen Unfaithful, I pictured their home as my home.  As for my husband and I in bed.  I pictured a scene from the movie, Family Man.  I couldn't actually see myself, my husband, or my kids.  I wasn't able to imagine a scenario in my mind.  I could imagine my life right now in my head, but as for years down the road I use other images.  I'm excited though for the day I have these things although I'm not in that much hurry. I like to torture my boyfriends with the idea of a little Rebecca running around.  For some reason I get a lot of cringes.  I don't know why really.  I'm a great girl!  We'd each have matching Louis Vuitton purses! Wouldn't that be so cute?!  I think so.  And if I had a boy I'd dress him up all cute too.  His name would be Andrew.  He'd be a ballerina.  Just kidding.
