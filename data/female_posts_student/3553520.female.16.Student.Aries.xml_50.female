Why is it everytime I see a glimpse of her I start to cry?  My life is falling apart.  Over two other lives that I've taken in.  And now I'm going to lose both.  One by choice. One by chance.  Its all going to be gone.  And then what? Then what do I do?  I can only hope I feel better than I feel now.  Because right now  I dont want to know what feelings are.
