He never will be serious about anything, apart from his band, yes that he is serious about and i shouldn't have spoken to him, as its probably stressed him out and now hes got this deadline. I can't pretend i don't give a fuck, because i do, and i can't believe some of the things that he said, made a mistake loving me, he just keeps on making mistakes, he keeps losing his senses, keeps being a prick, thats what he does, and i fool for it and think everytime he will change, give him some time, some belief, some nice thoughts he'll not cheat, he'll not lie, he'll not hurt, but thats what he does best, hurt, cheat and lie, and he will continue to do it for the rest of his life, sure he'll be able to make up amazing lyrics on all the shit he does, or maybe he won't be able to tell the truth from the lies as he lies so much? Maybe he will end up lonely, well he will, there will be no one out there who will be bothered as people don't like liars and cheaters and people who seem to get a kick out of hurting others. He's two faced and stubborn and i refuse to love him anymore, refuse to think thats hes better than me, i am better than him and i deserve to be happy, where as he doesn't he deserves to be alone forever. Him and his sentimental guitar and shit, i just wish we'd never got togther, so what if we had fun at the time, we don't have fun now and things will never be the same, i put my heart on the line once too often for him, and now its not happening again, i will continue to fight with all my feelings until i feel nothing for him, nothing at all, no love, no hate, no nothing, hes not worth it and maybe when he realises he's not worth it he'll realise how much hes made mistakes.  ~Lisa~
