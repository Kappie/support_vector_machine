Only 5 years ago a 21 year old Wyoming man was beaten to death on a fencepost, and now bush is trying to ban gay marriage because " we need to protect the right of being married, dont want those damn gays infecting our rights". While other countries focus on real issues, bush bombs the fuck out of everything and then looks the other way and picks on some issue that is completely irrelevant. He spends so much money funding the military to create war, while all the schools are so scrapped for money the students have to pay for copies of tests and papers. The world today is so fucking focused on who we should hate now, who is worse than we are...  they cant even see real issues. The world is so blind to everything that it cant even see. Ignorant people are stupid. i really wish i had more power to change the world, to make it better... if you think i sound like a hippie, fuck you. Go give someone a hug.  Whoo. on a happier note, I love oasos. I have so much fun every time i go there, and everybody there kicks so much ass!! Even the people i think are annoying kick ass at oasos.  Oh! i got a toy car for my birthday from Julianne. She's a really cool person, the type who you would just be  school-friends with (so i thought) but shes really cool.  I drove my little red car around for hours today on the school walls making fake car noises. It was the shit. And then i went to the clinic and i forgot my bus pass and i had to walk from 28th and valmont to PEARL STREET! And i took the really retarded way, i walked all the way to Broadway and Iris, and then i had to walk up broadway. It sucked ass. My feet hurt now... i want a massage.  Then i went to see dylan... He was being a geek and reading The New Spawn Comic (Whoooo!) but thats ok... i love him. He is so damn cute. I mean.. uh... only gay boys like to be called cute.. dylan is....uh... hotter than spawn and johnny depp combined? haha. Anyway, i love hanging out with him, i love him, i love everything he does, i love everything about him. I love dylan.  Ugh. Im tired. How come i always stay up so damn late and type in my blog? Oh! and i have a warm purry kitty on my lap again, when i walk in the door she makes me hold her and pet her.. its so cute... but its hard to get up when shes that cute and warm!!  I want to go to the Boulder Dinner Theatre. Or Santa Cruz with dylan. that would be soooooooo fun...  My birthday is in 6 days!  Thats all i have to say. im really surprised and pleased that i actually still write in this damn blog. Oh well. All you 3 people who read my blog, enjoy. ~abby
