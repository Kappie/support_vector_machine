Except it's not.  Had a crazy time last night. Went to Rosa's with Manda n Rae, then we went to Target, messed around a while, then back to Rachel's house. Haha...we are quite crazy freaks. I laughed so hard I almost died.  Went to IHOP this morning then. Actually...this afternoon. Whatever, I'm still confused.  Got home...now I'm doing absolutely nothing. Hmm...I want to go get a shower now.  See you when it matters, crazies.
