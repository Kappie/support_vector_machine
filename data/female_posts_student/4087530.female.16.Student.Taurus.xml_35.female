Well I don´t know do you? And the chains so serrated And the proof? Well I don´t know do you? [End]  Will I ever loose These old catholic blues That direct my shoes Give me the strength to choose I feel all low The fear won´t grow If I show It just where to go But I don´t know  [Chorus]  Everything you beg me I take it on delivery Paid it off to lift me You´re all far too slippery What you gonna give me What you gonna give me Work I have To get through  [Chorus] 2x  Everything you beg me I take on delivery PAid it off to lift me You´re all far too slippery What you gonna give me Do do do do
