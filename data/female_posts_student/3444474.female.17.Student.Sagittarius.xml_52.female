It was teh suck.   Then, she told me she was going to wake up earlier, 'cuz I usually wake myself up at 7 to get ready by 8:45. Nope. Got up at 7...couldn't shower. I feel so gross. As soon as I get home, I'm bathing, lol, I feel gross. My hair is gross, I hate how my skin feels right now, I feel so greasy. I look fine, but I hate how I feel, know what I mean? I've gotten so used to getting up and showering that now if I don't and just get up and get dressed, I feel disgusting.   Ick.   So anyhow, I haven't talked to Cameron since yesterday at 6. He never called me back, he hasn't txt me back today either. I am a little worried. I'll call him when I get off work, see if he's ok. I don't wanna bug him, but I wanna be there for him and make sure that if he needs anything that he can just ask me. I hope he's ok.   back to work...*sigh*
