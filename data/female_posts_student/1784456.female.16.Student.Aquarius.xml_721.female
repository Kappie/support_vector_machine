I didn't think that was possible!) So err... just pretend that it's there!) Geez... long link... but it's a permalink, whatever that means! *clueless* So today was fun and no more school! We did a whole lot of nothing basically, then we looked at our SATs papers eeek! Nooo! That was horrible! We also found out what sets we're in next year... well some of them! I'm not moving down yeay! Or is that so good...? Hehe, we watched American Pie Uncut in Maths and our teacher turned it off because it started getting too dodgey! We watched a freaky French film that no one got in French cause it was mega mega hard french! Like the actual french that they talk in France! :O I mean oh my god, we don't know that! Any way - back to being happy that we have no more school! YEAY! We're gonna be in year 10 next year, ahh scary! I mean aaargh GCSE year! Yipes! Aaargh, holidays means me ringing around and arranging things! Help! Oh well... and hey, does any one actually know Mike's phone number? (New kid) I don't! Oh well!
