I think that we forget what sensuality, sexiness, movement, play, power and altered senses can do to us as far as the erotic.  I think that we forget touch, and how damn powerful it is- and that the erotic is not sex.  That touch and breath and awareness can simply lead to greater understanding- another layer of connection that words don't offer- picture worth a thousand type thing.  The workshop was really about body language, being able to see and understand these sublte movements.  There was an exercise where we got a partner, shut our eyes, and slowly touched their hands, arms, shoulders, neck, head, face, and then back down.  The class was entirely women, except one man, who asked me if I would be his partner.  With eyes shut I found a different memory of touch and breath, became so aware of what was happening in each fiber of myself- what I was projecting, what I was wanting, what was being asked for.  No words, no sight- just an intimate exchange in ten minutes.  After each partner had been pet, in the gentlest way, with eyes still shut we were drawn away from our partners.  We then had to find them, eyes shut, by touch.  There were hands, that I touched and was touched by, and I knew instantly that they were not the person I was looking for.  It was like un-entangling a web of closeness- each person looking, knowing that you are not right, that they are not right, and then moving on with out anger or judging.  When we talked about it afterward everyone had similar experiences, moments, a deep exchange of something that was not fluids or words- what had been exchanged was more potent and more open.  You felt loss without that person, and you looked for them with hope.  Before we were separated, when I knew it was coming, I was distracted by the loss of it, the loss that was coming.  Imagine- the tangible feeling, that resonated so deeply, after just ten minutes of this interaction.  We will all know them, their scent, feel, breath- after just minutes this happened.  It was human.  Another game we did, it was a game created for me.  It was a sport, and play, and amazingly what I am.  I'll save it for another writing, or maybe it is just a game that I will play with you if you ask.
