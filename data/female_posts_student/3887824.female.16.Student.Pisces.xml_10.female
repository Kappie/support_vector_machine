I learned what "ultrasonic" meant, which helps because my dad was an "ultrasonic technician" when he worked. (He is now Retired/Disabled). So, now I understand a little better. Weird. Anyway, asfor tomorrow, I'll be doing some more Physical Science and possiblyAlgebra 2. I also need to make banana nut bread for a bake sale, clean the bathroom, finish up the bible reading this week (thing I'm doing with Vickie), then work on some music.
