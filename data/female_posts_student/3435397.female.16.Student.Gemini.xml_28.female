I want to go to YLC camp but there is a problem....The problem is my cousin is coming out to monahan the same week and I promised him I would be there.  Jackie and Ashley also want to come out that week too.  And its the same week as the "X" and right now I don't think I could be out at camp with one person.  So I am really not sure what to do because I want to be there sooooooo bad! I want to meet people and all I hear is good things about it! I also lose nights off during the week and I am thinking about just not going to ACYC or Celebrate anymore.  Maybe I am to old or maybe it just isn't my thing anymore.  Something is bothering me and I am not sure what it is anymore.  I want to blame it on everyone else but its no ones fault no ones but my own.  I just think that some people think they are better then me because I don't get straight A's and I don't do everything with my church and I stopped going to church all together. But wouldn't you when you found out that your priest was charged? I am so scared to go back in that church I was there Thursday night for the first time in 6 weeks.  This whole experience has turned me away from church I still have a strong faith in god but I can't be at any churches anymore.  I mean Breanna Anderson was the liturgical Director this year and she didn't go to ACYC, Search, Celebrate, or YLC so do I have too? I don't even know if I want to be liturgical anymore.  When something like this happens to you with your priest wouldn't you be freaked about church and god and everything too? I don't know if I can't get my $150 back from camp or if Jen found a replacement for the week I wasn't going to be there then I will be at camp but if I can and she hasn't found a replacement I don't think I will be.....Later Gator
