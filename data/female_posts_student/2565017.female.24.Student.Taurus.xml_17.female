We stayed at Anne's for a while, thinking that we'll go out, untill I told her "ok, come on, let's go then, this is just talk now"... we got on our feet, and got going. First we were going to walk a bit.... We walked to town, to a supermarket, where Anne bought a pair of socks and pistachios, and I bought a hairbrush and pistachios.... then we walked on, to the lakeside, near the market place and spotted a terrace (=outdoor bar) so we went there.... and ordered drinks.   On the way walking there, by the way, we walked by a few drunks... one guy in a group of them said loudly to us "give me a piece of that ass".... *sigh* why is it that there has to be idiotic people like that... well we paid no attention them, just hurried up.  While having them and chatting away and eating pistachis, we wondered that how come we didn't see anyone we know anywhere around... so we started smsing our friends to come and join us. Tatu came =D HE bought a beer and talked with us for a while, then asked us to walk with him to Casino island (=an island with a hotel named Casino, it's not a gambling place, and the island goes by its name) and on to another island, where a few friends of his were (drinking beer).   We left him there, walked back, walked thru town, went to a pizzeria and had pizzas. Uhhh, I ate too much...  but it was good. Not having another one for a few months, that's for sure. Then we walked home... I think we left Anne's place around... 6.30 pm.... and now I'm back at home at 10.30 pm... so it took 4 hours, lol! No wonder my feet feel tired.... well, we both had bad shoes too... we had to walk slow and careful not to twist ankles!  Ok, now I have got to have a shower.... and then I'm going to get some zzzzz =)
