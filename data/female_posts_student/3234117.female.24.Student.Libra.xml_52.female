I need all the points I can get since I only scored a 5 out of 10 points on the first quiz.  Luckily we can drop our lowest quiz grade.  I'm actually really enjoying my educational endeavours this summer term.  The class is so interesting despite the work load that I have to put into it.  And it's a lot.  It took three hours just to interpret, by hand, the validity of the MMPI for just one protocol.  Don't be confused, I'm not complaining.  I'm actually enjoying the tasks and while I appreciate the educational value of hand scoring the protocols, it will be nice when computer scoring is used in the real world. It's so interesting putting together all the pieces of the puzzle and coming up with a distinct picture of the person.  Maybe I'm becoming a nerd, but I accept it.    I called about another practicum site yesterday.  Apparantly all I needed to say was that my father referred me, thinking it would be a good practicum site.  It also probably helps that my father approves medical/psychological procedures for this site.  I called them a few weeks ago asking if they had any opportunities to host a practicum student and they responded no.  So this time around I mentioned good old dad and the Doctor called me back within 15 minutes.  Thanks dad!  I think I'm doing pretty good as most of my classmates are still trying to find a practicum site for the Fall.  I'm also opening doors for other practicum students for later semesters.  How altruistic of me! Well...
