Nobody can escape the duty of painting the vista of their own lives; whether they know it or not they are doomed to choose their palletes and colors, every moment anew and thinking of the direction which the piece is going to take. Nobdy can tell you what colors to choose or what things to paint unless you allow them to; the choice is your's, always your own.   And in your choosing the only universal constant is that you must fufill two things: you must know yourself, and you must take responsibillity of what you create. Irresponsibile art is pornography or amusement, created once and tossed into a vat of public consumption with no reflection of the artist's soul or ideas. It is trash and excrement, spun forth and forgotten.   No; it is not art at all. To be an artist you must live and breathe your art, soak it in and develop it, and taste it and consume it, it must be as much a part of you as your arm or leg, and who cannot take responsibillity for their own arm and leg?  Only you can choose what you want to create. Only you can decide to be decent or depraved, kind or hurtful, good or evil; Your life is the canvas of your principles and ideas, to be molded into a perfect replica of your essential soul. Life is only self-expression, nothing more.   There is nothing dependable; except that which we choose to beleive is, there is no port for our regattas or solid ground on which we find our feet. Our lives are the tossing back and forth betwen the winds and the storms, forging always our path by our own choices through the fortuitous night.   Our lives are the lives of artists. Our meaning is our own.  -Theo
