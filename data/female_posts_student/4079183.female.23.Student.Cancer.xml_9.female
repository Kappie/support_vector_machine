I was at the store and have a hard time knowing that a tee shirt can cost $15.00 It can be hard having a child in the public school system. I want my child to have all the stuff that everyone else has but financially it is impossible when she grows as fast as she does. I think that kids clothes should be cheaper than adults since they are continuously growing. Face it, after a certain age we stay basically the same size unless we overeat/undereat or get pregnant... What is your opinion on this matter?
