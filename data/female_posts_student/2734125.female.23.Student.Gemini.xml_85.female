Nothing today was as vivid as those night wanderings, and I spent my day reading comic books and sighing.    This will be a year to remember I think, for the world and for me.  Even though there is a grey light out, it feels like night.  There is a constant hum of crickets and the veil of sleep is hanging outside my window.  The day is punctuated by gun fire celebration of our countries birth.  Fitting.  Its so fitting.  What do I want to say?  I knew that I was suppose to write, that there was something itching in me, that there still is, that there are a thousand words that layer on top and under me, squeezing me till I cant draw air.  I want to write about love, but I'm afraid of it now.  I want to write about magick, but its darker face is looming behind me.  I want to write about death, but it is dressed in pink, and the irony is chaffing me.  There is too much.  The bonzi on the desk is withered and dead.  There are the remains of half a lung laying in my room, where I coughed last night till I collapsed exhausted.  There is also the remainders, reminders, of passion in the discarded wrappings of love and sweat in my sheets.  Everything is sounding hollow today, everything I look at rings false.    I'll snap out of it eventually, its just I'm in the lull.  I'm in the inbetween, where everything is necessary dark.  Night of the heart, evening of the soul.  I am on break, brief though it may be, from the never ending adventure of life.  All my teachers are out on a smoke break, all the guards are home with their wives, all the children are playing outside while I watch from a cracked window.    Who's car is pulling up in front of my house? No one I know I think.  Its too fast and white.  In college we had a joke, which wasn't very funny.  We used to say that all men who beat their partners drove white cars, though not all men who drove white cars beat there partners.  It was funny because it proved true when we found out some ass hole who would beat up on his boyfriend drove a white suv.  That's also why it wasn't funny.  This car is white, and no one has approached my house.  I didn't even hear anyone get out of the car, but I may not have been paying attention, as I momentarily slipped back into the light slanting in to the dorm, and us walking through, and a glimpse of someone that I once kissed and later feared.  After that first semester I was a little tougher then I was before, not much though.    There is a beer bottle on the desk, half full, a forty.  It has been here for over a month.  Dead Guy Ale, Rogue.  It was left here by a roommate, and is still here, even though I have thought of moving it.  Ah.  A girl in a purple shirt got out of the car after it loitered for five minutes.  Then the car sped off, going too fast for a small kid oriented street.  Good bye white car.  May all the things you have coming to you return in full.  Damn it.  I think that I'm lonely.  Has this string of people in my life caused me to forget what it is to be alone?  Alone is fine.  We do alone okay, don't we?  We don't need eyes meeting ours, we don't need human touch, we don't need someone to cry to.  We don't need.  Everything is provided for us, everything comes, will come.  Rain will come, and sun and heat.  Maybe that's what this day is lacking: full clouds and no rain.  It is just warm and heavy. Why do I feel like crying?    I cant make all the rain for the world, and I cant make all the light and heat.  I feel I have given away some sort of energy that I took years to build.  I feel like I lived hard these last six months, and now I have the emotional hangover to prove it.  I feel like a flame that burned high and now is tiny in a damp room.  It will pass.  It always does.  Likely it will pass sooner that it should.  This is a break.  This is my bed to myself.  This is a strange quiet when I was so used to noise all the time.  Noise and sound and soul searing pleasure.  That pleasure flew away yesterday, and I felt weak and empty when it left.  What more to write, what more to leave blinking from your screen?  It has not been bright, but nothing is all the time.  The world was not made that way, for some reason I must assume.  I will take a journal to the park and watch people moving in their mundane lives and maybe get a bit of a kick out of it.  Maybe my sister will buy me a hot dog and I will feel American.  Maybe.  Maybe I will find some kind of detailed wonder yet unimaginable by my tiny world.  Maybe.  There is a sound now, it was a horn calling in the day, just like the sound of the horn in the lord of the rings.  What a strange thing to cut through the day.  It gives me hope that somewhere there are orcs attacking, and that it wont be such a boring day at all.
