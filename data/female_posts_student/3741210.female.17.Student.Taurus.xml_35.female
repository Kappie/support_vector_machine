My favorite line is after they've found Tom Robinson guilty and Atticus Finch walks out of the courtroom and the black man tells Scout to "Get up, your father's passin'"  The whole movie has such quiet dignity, and it doesn't over-explain things too much like movies today tend to do.  I won't say any more about it except if you haven't seen it or read it, go out and rent it today.  My headache is better since we turned the AC on.  My brother John is at a birthday party, and my other brother Stephen is out bowling with his friends.  I kinda wanted a night home for once.  I was going to go see that movie but Mom says that she doesn't want me to see it because of the bad scenes.  I understand her point, I hate sex scenes, they're so embarrassing!  Cold Mountain was physically painful at times, I kid you not.  Especially when you're with your mother.    I wrote a letter to my friend Bernadette tonight.  We still keep in touch with snail mail.  It's nice to get a real letter once in awhile instead of College ads.  I'm so sick of thinking about college.  I want to "Forrest Gump" my way through life and just see where it takes me, however I am way to much of control freak to let myself do that.    "The Best Years of Our Lives" is on now.  I think my Dad wants me to watch it.  Good night all.
