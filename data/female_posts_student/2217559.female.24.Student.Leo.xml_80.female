I am busy running around getting all of my tables organized and of course must be in formal attire by 5:00pm.  It will be so nice to come home and retired all of these panty hose and heavy gowns. I plan to wear jeans and t-shirt everyday - well, almost everyday. Hehehe.  Yesterday was really nice. I woke up to huge beautiful mountains outside my porthole. I only worked for about an hour yesterday morning before heading off the ship.  I took the city transit into the very small town of Skagway.  Grabbed my usual double expresso and headed out to explore the city.  I went into a gorgeous fur shop and tried on a $9,000.00 beaver and fox coat. It was so soft I could never imagine wearing clothing underneath.  Wow! Tineke and I met up and went to this great sports bar called Bonanza's.  We had some burgers and a couple pints of Alaskan Amber beer. Really good stuff. We shopped around until dinner time and then went to this great seafood restaurant where we ate Alaskan King Crab. Wow - it was th ebest seafood I have ever had.  There were 3 ships in port so of course we had a bit of a wait but it was all worth it in the end.  We sailied last night 9:00p.m. and I was actually in bed by 10:00p.m.  Hahaha.  Well, I didn't go to sleep until late because I am watching this great UK DVD series right now called, Teachers. It's awesome - very funny to see the differences between American schools and schools in Europe.   Anyway, what else - still counting down my days. I have about 18 to go which I think will fly by.  I got an email from Lisa yesterday and she is getting excited about coming to Texas.  I am just getting excited about seeing my Mom and Grandmother. My two favorite people in the world.   Tomorrow we are sailing through the Hubbard Glacier and lucky me! I will be on the bridge with a bunch of VIP guests at that time. I am so excited to see this wall of ice and from the best place on the ship at that!  Oh yeah, there maybe some interesting news coming soon about my family-I am sworn to secrecy right now but as soon as I can, you will be the first to know! *wink* luv, shell.
