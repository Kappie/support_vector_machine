Till today, I had not forgotten how much fun we had in school. Going to school was the best thing for me (last time).  Thinking of how we had to "correct" the teachers when they taught us something wrong and how they couldn't answer our questions just makes me excited. Remember Cikgu Saniyah and her high heels? Hahaha..   We even had our  *secret*   rituals. I think no one other than our gang knows about this ritual that we had every week when we were in Form One. Hahhahahaha....  Such good natured fun, that we had during those days, can hardly be found now. Everyone grew up and had to learn to be mature. (Although, I still am very much the same as I was, just that I can't find other *crazy* friends who are willing to so these things with me anymore.)  And, thinking about Form One, it made me think about how I met J****a. Good news, J****a had given birth to a cute baby boy   on 26th July, 2004.      How I wish to have a time machine right now to go back   to year 1991-1996. Definitely the GOOD OL' DAYS!!!
