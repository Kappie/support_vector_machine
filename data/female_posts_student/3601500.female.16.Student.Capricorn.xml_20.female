The course is in English after all, and the neighbour girl is taking it too, but she hasn't spoken to me. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow - after all, I know I appear cold to most people, and maybe she's also not the kind to be all 'Hey, hello! Can I sit next to you?'. ...Anyway, the seat next to me is taken (blah).  Talking about driving courses - my mom bought the 'boating safety' manuel *in English* (so I wasn't happy), I just have to fill my exam (which goes with the pack) and hand it out. I read the manuel while at the cottage.  So, I came back from the cottage yesterday and got to bed (because I hadn't slept well, and I got up early that morning to go fishing). I woke up later, but didn't feel like writing in my blog. My muscles are aching, since I did water skiing. I tried like 15 times to get on the skis, but didn't work! The following day, I tried again, automatically putting my arms around my legs. That did the trick. -o- (My legs would split up because they were too separated, or I would get pulled and dive head first in the water). It's really tiring though, and I didn't enjoy it much. I'll try again later...  In other news, I joined Neko's requiem forum, and they started a hentai rp... I won't participate, because er - I don't like hentai? Yaoi, yum... Hentai? Blah. >.> Yep, that's all for now. :P
