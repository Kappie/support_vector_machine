My dog woke me up this morning at 7:30, but it was so funny.  My dad had set the mirror he bought for my room against the wall and my dog kept going up to it and backing away and going up to it and backing away.  Even though I was mad at him for waking me up so early it was very funny.    Then once I got up the strength to roll out of bed I took a shower and did some physics and Algebra homework.  Physics is a lot easier this chapter, I'm glad.  But I still need your book Renae!  Then after that, my parents came home from god knows where and my mom started in on me about helping around the house.  She says all I do is sit and watch TV.  Whatever!  I have yet to sit and watch an entire TV show from beginning to end since school began with the exception of my sick day, which doesn't count.  If parents only knew all the work we kids do.  I mean if parents were to switch lives with us for a day I bet they'd be happy to take their old life's back!  Adults these days have no idea.  I think my mom is in the "must clean" mood b/c my grandparents are coming down and my mom's mom has this thing about everything being clean.    I must tell everyone that the play was amazing.  I wish I could go again before it's over but I don't think I can.  But it was good.  Forget Joel, Sean you were great!    Halloween is a wonderful day...When you are a kid.  It has lost it's luster.  Maybe it's because I didn't get to enjoy it this year?  I feel so bad you guys.  The next day Renae has off we will have a movie night at my house I promise!  We'll have pizza and popcorn or whatever else ya'll want.  But I have one request....Please don't make me watch a scary movie!    ~tata
