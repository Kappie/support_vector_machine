I can continue to sit on my ass and waste my days away doing absobloodylutely nothing... and feel no guilt!... yet.  The spring feeling has also come in with a kick in my ass.  I'm in the 'spring cleaning' mood, and yesterday i completely tore down my room and rearranged and cleaned everything.  I wonder how long it will last this time.  I went out to dinner with Rachel last night at Red Robin.  It was good to catch up with her, especially since she's the only one of my old friends who bothers to call and make plans with me.  I'm a little ticked off with a lot of people right now, just due to the fact that after all of the times I've tried to fit everything around them, they won't bother to ask for my input on certain decisions.  I was asked to go up to Jess's cabin, but because she clear things up with me on who was going, I've decided to not go at all.  I'm not going to go into too many details... thats the problem with a public blog.  "Slit my wrists and hope to die. Make my friends wonder why."  I was talking with Rachel, or should I say gossiping (such a sinful word), and she told me that supposedly someone told her they thought I was in a 'gothic mood.'  What the hell is a gothic mood?  There is no such thing...  Just because I've started to change who I hang out with because they're the ones who actually make plans with me, doesn't mean I'm gothic... I mean sure, I do wear a fair amount of black and offensive shirts... but that doesn't change who I am.  Or does it?  What's wrong with who I'm becoming, eh?  Not like you have tried to impact me in other ways, like calling to make plans, oh wait, you're too busy with your other friends... who are precisely the reason why I'm not going up to Jess's cabin.   I'm confusing myself.
