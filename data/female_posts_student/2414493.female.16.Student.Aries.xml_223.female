And I've spent a few minutes talking to Scott about old YSP times. Yeah, that's the way to go.  I miss YSP. Not that aching, homesickness, where am I? kind of feeling but that nostalgic man, those were good times kind of feeling. I miss waking up late in the morning when Alissa has already gone to breakfast and I'm just too lazy to venture into the DC. I miss hopping on the bike and riding out to the greenhouses as fast as I can because I'm late. I miss coming back for lunch, listening to crazy conversations and wanting to laugh so hard. I miss letters from Tiff and Jess and Tiff and emails from Nige and reading them and laughing. I miss trips into town with the girls on the floor, I miss playing mafia, even if it's by flashlight at the Mt. Lassen campgrounds at midnight. I miss just talking to these awesome people, being around them, running into them. I still talk to Katy, of course, and Kylan and Abdul and Scott G. Lauren occasionally. Maybe Sabrina. Takao is going to  Yale. Wow. I didn't see that coming. But good for him, really.  Piano lesson was actually all right. Played through the entire Schumann, first movement. A judge remarked that I slouched. (yeah I do!) Mr. Francis wants me to play both Bach showcase and Colburn. I object, but what can I say?  I just looked up Hegel to make sure he was the plain/pleasure guy. Yes, he is. Would the AP language readers know? Maybe not, but I don't want to pass myself up as a fraud. I liked that third essay, yes I did. The other ones were mediocre.   I'm just comfortable the way I am right here. I don't want to budge to study Spanish.   Sometimes I just wonder why I spend so much time typing up these things. It's personal satisfaction, yes, but then I must keep in mind the danger of giving substance to my errant thoughts. It's done me a good deal of harm before. I just wonder if I'm going to look back in a year and ask myself why I was so stupid to think like this. This surely isn't as extreme as the last piece of damning evidence, but it's still a record of thoughts. I'm not obsessing over anyone, that's a plus at least. I'm hoping I'm less of a self-centered, arrogant little priss this timea around. But then again, I think: that one hurtful piece of egotism: I don't like to hear it repeated back at me (especially with editorial underscores), but was it wrong to think that way? Maybe I was judging on too superficial of a level. How true the statement is, I don't care. Oh, but it was such a pretty little book, that cream paper, the leaf pressed into the leather cover. But at least this is somewhat censored; I have a wider audience to consider. I just can't believe I screwed up my whole entire mental state sophomore year, at least. But that's what sophomore year's for, right? Petty, sophomoric deeds that make you want to forget that they ever happened. I was happy then. Not now. Is that wrong? I don't think it is, but I've been criticized for being cold before. I've tried too hard, though. And I hate myself now for it. I keep on interpreting everything as hah, he's finally learned. That's what I looked like last year! That's too cruel of me, though. That kind of statement could hurt me again.  Enough of that. I don't care. I'm surrounded by wonderful people, and that's all right by me.   Over dinner, Mom and Grandma talked about family ties. About how distant relatives married, got divorced. How kids wouldn't listen and turned out useless. I wonder, am I doomed to become dinnertime conversation twenty years down the road? In my mind, marriage is sacrosanct; I don't believe in agreeing to it and then changing your mind a few years down the road. I want to make a name for myself. Oh hell, what does it matter. It's AP week.  Get a life, Lydia.
