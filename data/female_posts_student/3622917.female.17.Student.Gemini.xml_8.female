I saw Julie and Erin. They are so much fun! Almost makes me want to go back to work sooner. I was talking to Julie and I had just bought some popsicles. And she was saying how she really loved popsicles and apple juice when she is sick. I have told them that I will be back in a couple weeks. I am really hoping that I manage okay. I am almost sure that I will but hey you never know really. I saw Mr. Beatty in the parking lot on the way home. He had his baby with him and the baby is soo cute. Well I guess he isn't really a baby anymore but whatever. Anyway on the way home I didn't even think of the apple juice thing until I was turning into a convenience store to buy some apple juice. And you know what it was good. Actually Julie leaves soon for her big trip. So when I finally start back at work she will be gone. Sad. Oh well, she will come back eventually. And I'll still have Erin. Yay! Well, I am trying to write stuff that is important in here but I can't really think of anything. So I guess that is all for now. Not going to be anything else today as far as I know... But that isn't very far.
