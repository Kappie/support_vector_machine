I should have known this would happen, but in my zeal to finish reading them all, to absorb all that is currently out there, I ignored this, when I could have been preparing myself.  Perhaps I was unprepared because this usually only happens with movies, and not so much with books, for while I like reading, words have never flown off the page for me in the same way that images dance before me on the silver screen, and thus I have never gotten quite so involved personally in the outcome and the world of books as I have with film.  However, I could sense my feelings, could tell by the way I would shout out at key points, and react viscerally and loudly to things that happened, almost as if it were playing itself out before my eyes - I could see it all - so I should have realized...but I did not.  Anyway, I have always done this...gotten personally involved in things that aren't real.  I get moody and irritable...it's why I never like, or generally don't, like to talk after a movie.  And it isn't any specific outcome that does it...at least I don't think it is.  Instead, it is more to do with the fact that it is over.  I get so immersed that I don't want it to end.  I guess the knowledge that there are more parts to the story should be some comfort to me...but I guess it is the lack of the immediacy that has got me down.    But I shouldn't dwell on it.  I always get over it.  Always.  And I always return to the real world, the world of the living, after dallying in fantasy for too long...but I always fear that I will not.
