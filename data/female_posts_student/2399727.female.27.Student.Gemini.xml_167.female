Got a bursary application too.  Things are falling into place.  Did I say yikes?  Got a hold of my sponsor for next week.  Monday 9:30am, my day(s) of fun begin.  Yikes.  Days after Monday will be determined based on my interest.    Back home in Steeltown.  Bussed it all the way.  Dude on the bus was laughing so hard I could hear him with my headphones on. The problem was he was sitting all by himself, and didn't appear to be listening to anything funny on a Discman or anything.  Yikes.  More to come...
