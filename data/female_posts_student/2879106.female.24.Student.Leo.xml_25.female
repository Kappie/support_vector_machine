I wrote five testimonials the other day for friendster that never showed up and then yesterday I wrote a post on here that never showed up. I am not really sure what is going on. Oh Well!!!! I don't think I really said anything yesterday that was important, so you aren't missing out on anything.   So I have been ripping CD's into my computer lately. I am having a lot of fun doing it because now I can make mixed CD's for all of my friends. Also I have been borrowing CD's from friends so I can make mixed CD's for myself with any of the cost of going to walmart to buy a CD for just one song. COOL COOL COOL. I am loving it!!!   Also I have been hanging out with friends a lot lately. Any of my friends that are about to read this I don't want you to take offense to what I am about to say but.... I am really going crazy!!!!! God I am not one of these people who have to have my alone time but right now I haven't had anytime alone at all. I really need to find sometime to just sit in my room with a cosmo and music. I just need sometime by myself so I can relax and take care of myself for a minute. Right now as I speak I am sitting at Alisha's on her computer. All I want right now is to home in my room, doing nothing at all. I love my friends but I just need to be alone!!!!  Well I guess that's all for now. I am going to go into the living room and watch TV. Love always
