I mean serious troubles. sure, everyone's entitled to their mood swings and emotions. but when it happens to the degree where it freaks other people out...whats really the matter? and you can't just say "nothing".  Not saying i'm a map of a peach myself, but, today i was actually really happy, i was alone, but for some reason nothing is getting to me the way it used to. except this. i came to school great, wonderful, school is NOT whiking my ass, i understand everything and am doing fine so far ( yes- only the first day back, but its a step) ...but this was something i didn't think would be something to bother me. but  all  day it was in my mind. i dont understand it or why we act the way we do. but its So weird. and it really worries me. especially when its only around me. am i really that bothering. b.c. if i am, i'd rather just go away than see you like that.  I know you'd say its the usual, and that it wont change anytime soon. but, when you think about it. killing yourself over something that WILL come...is sort of wasting the here and now. when why dont you just 'carpe diam' and live like there really is no tomorrow. tho i know that tomorrow is all you're waiting for.  i feel the exact same way, i alway will desperatly want nothing more...but that doesnt mean that b.c we live in this feeble hell hole, all is lost. ok, yes, it makes it difficult beyond all means, but please. smile more. you're beautiful. and i miss the loud spastic you, when you get like this. but when you said that there's nothing to talk about anymore........i mean....how can you say that? unless you dont want to talk about anything. live is boring, yes, theres nothing going on. but its still our life. that counts for something doesn't it?  i dont know. you can just ignore me, i dont know what i'm talking about. it just scares me sometimes when i feel like somethings about to give from under me.
