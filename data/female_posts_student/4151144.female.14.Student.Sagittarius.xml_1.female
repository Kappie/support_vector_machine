Whice all in all lead me to think of Trent. She refers to him as  "my man ". I must say I do like the sound of that. But in all reality he's not  "my man".. well not yet atleast. Let's not forget that he's 17 and lives on the other side of the state. But as lame as this sounds I'd be willing to make it work. It would be my first ever relationship, if that's what you want to call it. I don't know, it's not like me to be like this. It's just..when we danced. Oh lord, when we  touched .   I wrote him two letters and sent him a picture of him and I together. I told him to call me sometime. I hope he does. I hope he writes back also. I miss him so much. He if calls I think I just might ask him out. But don't quote me on that. I'm not going to say that he's  "the one".   I hate how everyone feeds me this crap about there being someone for me. Screw that. There is not someone for everyone. Atleast not for me. The only one that I could ever want to marry is Lucas. But he's out falling in love with someone else right now. Wait, I take that back. He's always out falling in love with someone else other than me.  But still he says he  "cares about me".  Then why did you say no? Oh yeah, you have a girlfriend.
