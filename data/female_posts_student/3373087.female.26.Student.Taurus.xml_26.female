I won't go into it further because I don't want to relive those strong feelings now that they have finally faded. I tried hard to concentrate on the sermon and worship service today, but I was mostly preoccupied with what I'm going to do with Aviv's living situation. All in all, it worked out well and everyone's happy--except I'm back where I started and out $445 for August.   I spent most of the afternoon showing Aviv around the VMTH, Davis, taking him around to run errands, and going back and forth to his new place. I don't regret spending a lot of time helping him out because I could only hope that someone would do the same for me if I were in a foreign country. It was fun talking about our culture and language differences. We even got on the topic of religious differences with him being from Israel and all. Not only has this tiny country of 5 million people (just a fraction of the size of California) been the stage for thousands of yearsof Christian history, it also continues to make immense ripples in today's current events. Wow, I really should pay more attention to what's going on in the Middle East.   I was surprised to learn that there is a substantial population of Muslims living in Israel. How could anyone NOT be a Christian in the Holy Land? Aviv is "not religious" yet he literally lives just off the Sea of Galilee. How cool would that be to walk literally in the footsteps of Christ--to sit where He may have sat and to see the same landscape? Israel may be called the Holy Land, butguess there is nothingholy about the land itself afterall because it does not move everyone who visits to be holy (Aviv, for example). I guess that goes to show that your environment alone does not influence your belief. It's silly to think that yet I somehow thought that people in Israel were automatically Christians or Jewish just because they are surrounded by so much Biblical history.   I'm at DGD's house now. I'm really sleepy now so I'll write more about that tomorrow.
