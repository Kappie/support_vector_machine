I have done little things here and there, Sarah came over to visit, but gosh there is nothing to do. I was thinking about going for a walk but the road that I live on is so bad that I don't think I can take all 3 kids on it by myself.       So here I sit.....and sit.....and sit.....and sit.....and sit..... well I guess it is better than shiting lol.      The kids are sitting out in the pool outside and I am watching them while I type on here. They are having a fun time, I wish I could lol. I think I need to go do some more laundry, since I did my last one at like 2ish so it time for another.  Well someone is IMing me so I will be back later.
