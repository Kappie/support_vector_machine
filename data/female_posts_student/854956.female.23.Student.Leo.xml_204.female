Took us all about 10 minutes to load up the cars with the stuff, and drive it over to the support center.  Then we unloaded everything and checked stuff in... and realized... we forgot the napmats.  So I drove back to pick them up... before I went, I invited Steve to come along with us to EZ's on Bandera @ 410.  The rest of the gang went on there, and I went and dropped off the mats.  I met up with them, and Steve saved me a seat right next to him.  Interesting... well, so we all went and ordered some food, and sat there and chatted.  There was me, Steve, Angela, Angela's friend Stephanie, Will, Kristen and her boyfriend Leo, Samantha and her boyfriend (I forgot his name... oops), and then Greg swung by for a bit, too.  He told me some awesome news!  He and Heather (his girlfriend, not the horrid, evil one from work) are engaged!  They're gonna get married in about a year.  Well, so we all were sitting there and watching the game on tv... stupid Lakers were ahead last I saw (halftime).  Anyhow, as we were leaving, Steve said, "we should get together sometime this summer..."  So I said, "yeah, that'd be fun" and told him that I had his home number through work.  He said to give him a buzz... (I had to go and get timesheets finished up for Angela and Samantha)  Well, I knew if I gave him time, HE'D say something about hanging out.  So, we'll see where it goes.  Sidebar, he looked really cute tonight in his non-work clothes... :-)  Hehehe  Smitten Kelsie should prove to be quite fun!  :-)
