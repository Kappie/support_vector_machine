Hmm, I went to Ezone at Tampines Mall to find Sai Lam, Ivan n Guo Wei. We had lunch together at de food court wif Jian Long also. After de quick lunch, we rushed to watch Spiderman 2 right away. It was a marvelous show(cant find a better word den MARVELous.. it's a Marvel Production anyway ^^)! I tink de show is not bad overall.. Jus tat.. Maybe not enough new action n fighting scenes. I mean, since spiderman 1 oready hav those boring fighting scenes, i tink they only add a bit of de story n nuttin new. Too much of de same thrill will make T-H-R-I-L-L spelled as B-O-R-I-I-N-G you know... ^^ I heard from Ivan(who read from a magazine) tat de director will make spiderman movies all de way to 9th! Can u believe it? NINTH! Wow... I wonder how many spiderman fans will exist by tat time comes. Anyway, during de show, there was a lunatic(kinda bald, wearing white, skinny, noisy, jeans, lame handphone tone, had a scar across his cheek[no.. jus kidding ^^]) disrupting de show. He was shouting to a man in front duno wat stuff n den went behind n shouted(again) 'EXCUUUSE ME!!!' den sat down. After a while, his handphone rang n most of de ppl there 'shhh' him. After tat i duno where he went. Wat-de-hell? Many got pissed of i guess... Lunatics... Mind of a 3-year old.. No wonder he got sooo excited by spiddie... I heard from ron later tat he went into Cinema Hall 3 too(ours is hall 1). Den he got dragged out by de arms by a staff there. C'mon, where's de security? Shoot! It'll be a better 'show' den spiddie 2... ^^"  We(me, ivan, guo wei, sai lam) went to meet ron in GV den went to pavilion to play CS wif jianlong n zhan yuan. There's a total of 5 coms there, mine, jianlong's, sailam's n ron's, ivan's n zhanyuan's, guowei's. I am in de same team wif Jianlong throughout de 4 maps(awp_map, cs_assault, fy_iceworld, fy_pool_day) played. I got top frag in assault n iceworld n jianlong de other two! Cool huh? We had nice teamwork man! Hahax... I went to buy a watch after playing at bout 5.30pm. We shopped around many places at TM n CS. Den I finally bought one tat costs $78(25 Hours). It's silvery n de surface is black in color. Hahax, i at first wanted one tat costs $138 but I very  thrifty  one(notice the word in  italics ). After which, jianlong, ron n me had dinner at Mc. I was very full wif de mcwings, mcnuggets, fries, drinks... We went around walk walk(help digestion ^^) den went home lor. Found out something secretive jus now. But can't publish here(since its suppose to be a secret).. So sorry, ppl! It's not my secret though, for The One reading these, relax, i'm not telling anyway... Hehehehehehe... *EviL GrinX* Okay, gotta stop here i guess. Gotta go to bed n hav a rest. Kinda sleepy. Buaix~~~  P.S: Credit to Jason's bloggy for quotes today.

Even though we sometimes have to give up the things we want the most. Quote 2: No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, it is the one I love who'll always be the one who pay. I want a life of my own, I am spiderman... No More!
