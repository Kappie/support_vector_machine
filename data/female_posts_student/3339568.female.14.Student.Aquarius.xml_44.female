Everyone had gone to the hall at lunchtime to watch Hannah Sena and Beth dance. So after Julia and I sat in awkward silence for ten minutes we decided to join them. As we got there i saw Beth and Han fiddling with the CD player, and the rest of the group playing Basketball. I decided to join the b-ballers. We were just mucking around for awhile, no real teams, when i saw jacki on the opposite side of the court preparing to pass the ball to Bubs. The quick thinker that i was, i decided to run infront of Bubs and jump for the passing ball. Unfortunately it was more of a dive, a dive that i forgot to land. Instead of landing triumphently on the polished wood (with the ball in my grasped hands), i seemed to be diving horizontally around one and a half metres from the floor. I don't exacly remember how i landed but i remember i was in pain. Not like blood pain, just aching. Everywhere. I quickly pulled down my skirt and looked around. Everyone was either laughing or seeing whether i was OK, how embarrassing. I don't think i even got the ball. I was curled in a heap on the floor, when i heard Ozzy's booming voice "That's it, everyone, OUT!". Well, actually i don't remember that, i was told she said that later. Jess and Gemma pulled me up, i was doing nothing, just trying to pull myself down to the floor. They finally got me up, practically dragging me to the stairs. What was even worse, is that whenever people tried to cheer me up by saying something funny, tears came bursting out of my eyes! I told them to not make me laugh, but i don't think they understood, so as we were walking up the stairs, everyone still trying to make me laugh, i couldn't take it anymore, and ran to the bathrooms. That was my story of how i 'fought the law of gravity', my superman experience, my stupid attempt to be a bird.   Typical.
