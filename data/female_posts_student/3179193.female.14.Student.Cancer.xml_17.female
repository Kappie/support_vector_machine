I talked to Will and Wilfred about something last night and I'm just waiting for their comments on it. Blah.   Talked to Brian here and there today about stuff and yeah. I know he'll keep his mouth shut though. I trust him. Might send him the thing. Dunno. I'll see.   Martin thinks I should say something but Moca says I should act upon what is happening now instead of saying something. I guess I have to agree with Moca. It's better in the long run. I'll see what Will and Wilfred has to say about it. I probably won't be hearing from Will for a while. He hardly comes online. I'll see him at Bethel though so we'll talk then! Hehe~ ^^   So bored. Talking to Julie about stuff. Didn't talk to itf much today. I didn't say much on purpose. Blah.   Things happening everywhere... all is screwed. Blah... whatever.  I'll blog later. Don't feel like blogging right now.
