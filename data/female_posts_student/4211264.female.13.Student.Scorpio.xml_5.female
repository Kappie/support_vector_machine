But it is goldenish, just like this color,  right here . Sexy, I know. After we went shwimmin', we went back to her house, zen went to Impulse, and got two movies. We only ended up watching one, "Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure", which is incredibly stupid, but good. I don't feel like writing much anymore, so I will be going now. Shee ya.  -Sierra
