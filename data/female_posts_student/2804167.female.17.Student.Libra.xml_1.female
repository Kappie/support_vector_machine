The streets were lined with gas-burning streetlamps and vendors, selling junk to tourists. It was late afternoon and clouding. 	We found an artist, his watercolors and sketches pinned to a makeshift easel. He was just preparing to head off for the day, but our troupe accosted him and begged that he draw one last portrait. An old man, skinny and white-stubbled, he wore an old army coat and his vehicle was a rundown bicycle. He was frustrated that we had come so late, but was clearly in need of the money and agreed to stay. Early into his drawing the rain broke, and his distress was evident as the drops neared his shabby display of striking paintings.  	This disturbed me too, so that I moved to shield the manâ€™s works with my own jacket. I realize now that what I really feared was that my own art and skills would be banished to such a disgraceful life, to suffer the whims of a selfish girl for a few dollars. It is a horrifying prospect, and I see now that to deter this fate I have to sculpt my own impending lifetime. I try to take advantage of what supplies and time and attention are available to me today, and to search for a career which incorporates my art, so that I need not suffer poverty to do what I love.
