I try not to be one of thoses people that just drowns on and on about my boyfriend but this is my chance to spill. So if you don't like it! Don't read it! Isn't that why we live in America? Freedom of speach? Well that and the food that will eventually kill us in ten years. And on that note!... Last night I went back and read the blog entries that Pual wrote about me and it kinda gave him more of a persona in my mind since I haven't talked to him in two days! I kinda forgot his personality and just dwelled on him as my boyfriend. So the emotions hit me then. I really do miss him alot. I miss having him right there to talk to when I come home and I miss having someone to rant about my day to. I realise now how much a part of my life that he has become. I now know how truely good it is that this relationship is gonna go on for a long time because i don't think I would be able to go back to normality with out him.
