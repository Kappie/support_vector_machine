He's "not sure" if "I'm" the "girl" he wants to "marry." (The quotation marks make it sound fun, you think?)  And then he told me not to "take it personally."  How on earth I wasn't supposed to take that personally is totally beyond me.  I know right now, and have for quite some time, (without a doubt) who I want to marry. So why on earth doesn't he?  Of course, its silly of me to apply what I know about relationships and life to everyone else, but I figured that he and I had been on the same page for so long now, this is one of those things we could get together on.  So its looking like I'm gonna be living alone, (with the exception of my baby boy, Beau) within the next month or so.  I suppose I don't really have to. I guess I could move back in with Dad, or move in with one of my friends.  But I've never lived alone, I don't even know if I know how.  I'll look at this as a challenge.  And I'll face it the same way I face every unwanted challenge.  With a nap.  Adios.
