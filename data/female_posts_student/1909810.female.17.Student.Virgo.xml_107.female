And I know it's going to be a much bigger deal being a college freshman, but I've just been thinking about how this is my last year, and it's a huge relief in some ways, but it also makes me a little sad.  I've been friends with people for a really long time now, and thinking about how this is the last year that I'll be with them is kind of sad. But there are a lot of things that I won't miss.  Such as...well...everything I guess...other than a few select friends.  But I am looking forward to the silly senior things like the senior slide show, the graduation ceremony itself, sending out graduation invitations, senior pictures, I know it's silly and doesn't really matter, but I've had to just watch it for the past 3 years and now it's finally my turn :)   Ok I'm going to stop being stupid and shut up.    I need to read, still have 2 books for ap english and some writing to do about them, that's not too bad, but I'm a procrastinator and only have until the 23rd. But I've finished The Joy Luck Club, Frankenstein, and The Shipping News. I must say The Joy Luck Club and The Shipping News were incredible, I really really really enjoyed them, and as for Frankenstein, well there's some really cool ideas in the book and all, but it was just...boring I guess. I think it was the lack of connection with the characters, that's my favorite part of reading, I get so connected to characters that I am sad when a book ends because I don't get to read about the rest of the person's life. With Frankenstein I couldn't connect at all, the narrator was just annoying as hell and wouldn't stop complaining about how miserable he was and what a huge mistake he made...I didn't feel bad when his wife was murdered, he was stupid enough to not see it coming and it was just...bleh. But I think I'm going to like The Things They Carried, I've only gotten 3 or 4 chapters into it, and it's looking up so far :D anyways...I should go read now
