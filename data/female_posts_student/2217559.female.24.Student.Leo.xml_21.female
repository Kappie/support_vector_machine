I am excited about going home tomorrow. Just counting down the hours. I am so ready to get out of this town for the weekend. I need a break from everyone and everything. I need a vacation - guess I will be having one of those soon. Hehehe. I have told my grandmother that I am coming this weekend. I was thinking of surprising her. I don't know though -I know she has a lot going on this weekend so maybe I will go ahead and call her this afternoon.   I am still waiting for Royal Carribean to call me about my ship assignment. Hopefully they will call today or tomorrow. I hate waiting! I think I am th emost impatient person ever. I haven'tt alked to Jennifer today. Wonder what she's doing? Hmmm.
