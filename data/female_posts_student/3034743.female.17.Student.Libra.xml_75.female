There were some pretty interesting parts (who is your pee buddy?), and some fun parts (where the hell is my shirt? haha). I dunno. I didn't get much sleep at all. I fell asleep around 4:15, and I woke up at 5:30. Around 2:30 I think, I woke up Alex to tell her to turn off the light and tv...so she did. We didn't realize until later that I had woken her up to do it, instead of me doing it myself. Alex loves me as a friend! yay! I dunno. I'm gonna go watch a movie at Anna's tonight, but I'll be back later. Oh yeah....JORY THINKS I'M COOL!
