The whole weekend felt like the beginning of summer.  Highs in the upper-70s, grilling burgers and hot dogs on Karen's back porch, watching the boys chip golf balls, much to the quails' chagrin.  If it weren't for the Property flashcards, it may as well have been the 4th of July.  And the more we did, the better I felt.  This was going to be a good exam.  Sure, no practice exams had been done, no written answers to short questions or the like, but the whiteboard examples and flowchart of greatness made up for it.  Plus, it is impossible to prepare for this professor's exam.  He's giving us a real estate contract and possible title problems, and our task is to write a title opinion addressed to an a practicing attorney who's not versed in Property law.  No pressure.    Thought I would come home from studying last night to spend some time with the Contracts study guide before returning it today.  But no.  That will happen tonight and tomorrow.  Instead, I worked more on the outline and tried to keep my mind occupied so as to not think of what Monday was bringing with it.  Did a nice round of yoga, too, and that always helps.    Chatted with the Boy for a bit and all I want to do this morning is go to Bozeman.  I want it to be the 14th.  I want it all to be over.  Part of me is still in denial about it even being finals because it should only be the beginning of April, and part of me just wants the damn things to hurry up already.  Was doing so well all weekend and now I'm nervous as all hell.  Between 5 and 7, kept waking up doing Privity of Contract and Privity of Estate analyses.  When I wasn't walking through the flow chart of Real Covenants, that is.  Can't come up with hypotheticals while studying, but I have more than enough rolling around my head at 537 the morning before the exam, half asleep.    Just have to remember to take a deep breath, go slow, one exam at a time and by the end, there will be a great celebration waiting for me at the end.
