And we all know that freaky things are good. After the movie was over we played a little of DDR in the arcade room. That was fun, especially to see such an expert play that game. After that we went to the bowling alley and showed off how horribe we were at bowling. He beat me both times. Our scores were even worse, they didn't go over 80. It doesn't matter though it was great to be able to get out and do something with him. The only thing that went wrong today is that Jimmy fell and did something to his ankle about 5 minutes before we left. I found that really sad because he had done so much for me today and a throbbing ankle is no reward. Truthfully, I would have rather taken the fall instead of him, but over all it was an awesome day.
