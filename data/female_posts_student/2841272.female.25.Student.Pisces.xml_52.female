Now it's not that I think I have been too hard on the movies we have seen, it's just that the movies that have started off this summer movie season have been, all around, average at best. But as past reviews will tell you, there are some diamonds in the rough. I would urge anyone to go see   Shaolin Soccer  ,   Shrek 2  , or   Kill Bill Vol. 2  . And now comes a time for me to make a bold prediction: This so far average movie season will get it's first big triumph this weekend in the form of   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  . With all that said, onto my review of   The Day After Tomorrow  .  I guess it is finally official, with the release of a big, dopey disaster flick, the summer movie season is in full force. Last summer brought us   The Core  , which is still on my list of the worst movies ever, This summer it is   The Day After Tomorrow  . The disaster in question is environmental. Greenhouse gases melt the polar ice caps, and ocean currents are disrupted, causing all manner of Biblical weather. The chaotic climate change leads to continent-sized super storms that suck air from the upper troposphere, which flash-freezes everything in its path. And  voila ....A new Ice Age.  Along the way, New York City is inundated by a storm surge, from which writer-director Roland Emmerich conjures up a terrific rock 'em-sock 'em action sequence with mobs of panicked city dwellers storming the public library for safety. The people-plot revolves around Washington scientist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), who delivers the usual warnings to the usual arrogant government types, who brush him off. Jack's son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), is in New York, stranded in the library, helping everybody stay alive as the temperatures drop. Jack heads out on an Arctic-style journey to find Sam. The lengthy trek has its moments yet is vaguely disappointing. Maybe it's just that ice isn't as gripping as the raging explosions of   Independence Day  , also an Emmerich creation.  Ian Holm turns in a fine picture of a scientist caught in the storms. Poor Sela Ward is stuck with the thoroughly boring role of Sam's mother, a pediatrician who spends the movie talking on the phone or gazing at a patient. The Day After Tomorrow has generated an inordinate amount of brow-furrowing over its underlying message. Don't be fooled. This is not a policy paper, it's a movie - a make-believe yarn that invites you to put your brain in park and not worry about thinking for the next two hours.   Grade: C
