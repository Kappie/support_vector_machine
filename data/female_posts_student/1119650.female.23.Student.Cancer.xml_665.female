Cruisin' around drinkin' boones in Stay's car like we were 16 again.  Funny times, girls, funny times.  Headed to the boy's apartment for some forestry and just laughs.  Saturday I chilled around my house, baked some chocolate chip cookies and napped.  I saw possibly, the most disturbing porn I've ever seen (Bella Loves Jenna w. Jenna Jameson  Belladonna).  I never thought I'd say I was bothered by porn, but this time I really was.  And good GOD, Jenna is probably the most amazingly hot person I have ever seen in my life ever.  At night Andrew and I went to dinner at  urlLink F.I.S.H.  and yes, though its at the dump, they have amazing ambience, amazing food  deserts and an AMAZING martini selection.  My new personal fave is the Flirtini (Stoli Razz, Stoli O, Cranberry Juice, O.J. and champagne.  Yum!) and then we picked up Todd to go see VanHelsing.  Worst.Movie.Ever.  I almost walked out.  I was so *amped* for this movie and it sucked such balls its not even worth giving it a review.  Fuck!  Sunday Rosie died, which was sad, but once we made arrangements for her everything got a little better.  I baked peanut butter cookies and sugar cookies (my own recipe for the sugar cookies...and they were good!)  I spent some quality time with my mommy and then my brother and I took her out for a delightful dinner at  urlLink Ruth's Chris  so that was pretty slammin'.  I slept at my *own* house for the first time in weeks.  I have to say: I miss my bed its so comfy and squishy and soft, damn it.    All this baking I've been doing lately has prompted me to want to hone my craft.  Who knows maybe I'll open a quaint little bakery portion of things to go with me  Lisa's "top secret business plan" that we let go by the wayside.  That could be cool.
