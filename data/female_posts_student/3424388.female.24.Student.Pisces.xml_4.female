Would someone please come up with a way to retrieve, post-crash, text that has been entered in fields?  - Mandarian characters - are they more ardous to input? - ramifications for the ditigal divide - will the web make English even more ubiquitous?  - mental proccesses - difference in writing Mandarian for the web and in transferring print Mandarian to web Madarian  - bermuda ebusiness (a file on the site had a virus, Norton aborted it taking with it my blog entry, fueling my tech rage and resulting in this abbreviated entry in outline format) - further reaching implications for business on the web - changing corporate structures and physical locations  In short, my trip to China was phenomenal     (some of my pics are on webshots  urlLink http://community.webshots.com/user/merebartlett ).  The more I learned about China, the more questions were raised in my mind.  It's a fascinating place - even more so as it is in the throws of sweeping change.  I didn't have much time to learn about how the Chinese use computers and the internet.
