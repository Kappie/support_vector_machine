I won't be surprised if I hear in a few months that Mr. Holland's Opus became worn to the point of unuseable due to overuse a couple of months from now :) but that's the way these things go. The first thing I ordered for myself was a CD, long since broken...I don't even remember which one it was. But man, I felt like a million bucks, even if it was only $14.95 or something. Bitter irony.  Linds has it man (awesome job Linds). See, it's not that her post had any relevence...do any of them? Was there ever a specific topic line herein? NO. The point of the BLog is to post. It's like voting: you may not know shit about any of the candidates, but hell, you can say you voted by getting out there and pressing a couple of buttons! Well alright...that was sort of a bad analogy. But again, it's the principle of the thing. Just stir up a random topic, and voila.  I just watched  Interview With The Vampire . Man, what a great movie. There's you a random topic, in case anyone cares to talk about it.  Um...really, I can't think of anything. I could say a bunch about Interview but I don't think anyone would really care. Not too many people this day in age have actually seen it. I will say, though, it's a totally different movie now versus when I was 10 or whatnot. I understood the concepts in the movie the first time, but only on that purely rational level, this time I had that good understanding of why somethings were sad. Like, the first time, I was like, "Die Kirsten Dunst! You bitch!" but this time I actually found out that this might not be such a good thing, even if she was a demanding little whore in that movie, and she made me want to punch somebody 90 percent of the time (she didn't this time, strangely). Ok, fuck this. It's boring.  I don't have much time right now, but I'm going to think of a great post and get back on here later. A topic, even. A topic that everyone will care about, even if it sparks lively controversy and makes us all hate each other. Actually, if that's the case, I probably am against it to, but again, it's the principle of the thing. Bah. I'm rushing this post too much. These things suck if you don't take your time with them. You can approach them without a point, sure, that's alright, and you can be bored and skip all over the place, it's still ok. But man, if you rush a post, it doesn't make shit for sense.  The end. (good one on the posting, Linds...we should probably meet these people we know someday, they sound to be pretty cool :) )
