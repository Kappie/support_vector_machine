I WILL start re-puzzling my room together, though! I also need to get back online later and go frame-hunting... does anyone know a good place to get simple frames for good prices? Also need to book hunt... I've yet to buy 3 of my AP books. I'm trying to shop very cheaply, as I will have to buy twenty or so more books throughout the year, and I'd really rather not spend $1000 on an AP class that I don't really sincerely want to take anyway. I really need to start reading, too... I only have a month and a half to read all five, and I'm sure that, once I'm out of the country, I'll be happily busy since I've been happily and unhappily busy even while stuck on this continent. There just aren't enough hours in a day! I say we move to a 48-hour day; I'd really need that. This is when the power reading course I never did get through would come in handy... wish me luck.  Side-notely, wow! I hadn't realized just how much hair mousse, hair spray, hair gel, and makeup I had left over from my legendary years of marching band (colorguard, if you didn't know). I threw most of it away as I am no longer required to transform my head to rock with the aforementioned chemical-infested liquids/semi-liquids so as to keep the hair in place while jumping around madly nor to mask myself as a clown with makeup to create a dramatic effect from the field!!! I'll give the experience credit for teaching me how to do all sorts of relatively difficult makeup including eyeliner, and, even better, how to do makeup well on a moving vehicle in the dark (Kim can even testify!)!!   And that, my friends, is definitely a part of the deal I do   not   miss.
