This is legit.  Check out  urlLink http://www.isipp.com/gmail4troops/    .     You can search for books (great for textbooks!) by price at   Chambal.com  .  This search engine compares prices from all major, as well as some of the lesser known, online bookstores.        There are some google and gmail haters out there. Since google is the darling of the internet, as well as its most popular global gateway, everything about google, from it's corporate motto of "Don't Do Evil" to it's algorithm, is worthy of zealous inspection. Come to think of it, google must know more about me than my mother. As we all know, most anytime you sign up for something free, there's a catch. Apparently google can keep your gmails on file until the end of internet time. Does that also apply to incoming email? I would guess that they can keep incoming emails, too. And although I don't know much about this, they have some sort of weird cookie thing that has been causing quite a stir. I understand why people, wiser than me, would raise objections.       However, I find that some of the objectors are more "spooky" (which is the preferred parlance of the objectors when discussing how gmail matches email content with advertising) than gmail's happy-go-lucky (non)privacy policy. For instance, check out this   denunciation of gmail   at gmail-is-too-creepy.com (note the .com istead of .org).  Now check out their   creepy staff page  .  They gotta be working for ping-happy MSN.    I think one of the better commentaries on the subject comes from Brad Templeton, who has worked as a consultant for google, collects revenue from google's Adsense program and is a Chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.      urlLink His Privacy Subtleties of Gmail  is fair and balanced (a phrase I now hesitate to use).    I wandered upon another google doodad this week,  urlLink Google Compute , which is google's way of encouraging distributed computing for a scientific cause. Compute allows users to install an application that works on a complex project, currently Stanford Uni's  urlLink Folding@home  project, which is trying to answer the question "What are proteins and why do they 'fold'?"        In my feeble head, this seems a worthy cause, plus you get this cool double helix icon on your toolbar (IE only, nuts). Maybe google really is just a do-gooder looking to pick up some mega bucks along the way. If I ever had a company with potential, I would want the same. Of course, I'm kinda unusual that way.     NB: It stikes me that google/Google is doing something else to English... corroding accepted assumptions about capitalization. I don't think this is necessarily evil, but I do find it interesting.
