(this involves holding your head in your hands and silently screaming)  i think my main problem with it was cos i havent done a proper bit of schoolwork for about 4 or 5 months, what with being off school etc. its incredibly hard to get back into the swing of doing it again. and now i'm so tired but upset i won't be able to sleep, i'll just sit up being paranoid and stressed.   bleeh. I HATE GCSES  so there. grr stupid examination board  this is supposed to be a day of rest!! (well, its yesterday now)  i was busy all saturday, i had to do it today. its not fair!!! *resists urge to have tantrum*  rite-o, im off to (attempt to) sleep off this terrible mood. i'll write something more spiritually enlightening tomorrow...
