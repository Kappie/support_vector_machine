Reading his blog makes me grin like a fool. (haha, i was talking to liz the other day and she said she was grinning like a fool and i was like "what? youre getting a pool?" and i felt stupid. ANYWAY.) woah. that was dumb.  GAH! im all paranoid my boomers wont make it, cause of security reasons.  i would cry.  mmm. ::good thoughts:: i put them in all kinds of bag and then behind a book, so the cams couldnt see it.   im bored! this is boring.
