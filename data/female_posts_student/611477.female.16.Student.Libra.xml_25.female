I should have an interestingly multicoloured sock finished sometime today (Friday!!)  but I want to just enjoy being home for a while before getting some sleep.  At least catch up with online activities from the first half of the week, then find some of this week's shows my brother taped for me and knit at the TV for a while.  Most of my washclothes I left for my grandparents, so no pictures of what I did.  Next time I visit I know they'll be somewhere easy to find.  They had some crafts I did EIGHT YEARS AGO still hanging from their fridge.  Ah, grandparents.  (They have 10 grandkids, but I could only spy loot from about half of them.  My grandparents are still unpacking from their move three years ago!)  Last entry I posted the link to the board for most of my rambles about this trip - go there for the full story.  Hmph.  It might be a while before I get caught up!
