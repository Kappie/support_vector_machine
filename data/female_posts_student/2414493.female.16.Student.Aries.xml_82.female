Went over the 50-question packet, got four wrong, but what the hell. Am envious that I can't do the Asian pencil twirl. I think one guys hair looks like a tamed version of R's, or A's. And he got a 1560 on the SAT...so what's the use?  What's the use? I don't know if I even need it, but I must appease the parents if I want to have eight weeks of peace over the summer, so might as well. It's $20 a session. I don't think it's worth it, but mom and dad won't stop harrassing me about it, so if it makes them happy, then go for it.  Must...practice...piano. And I'm going to get the evaluation back tomorrow, ew. Bach and Ravel.
