"There are few things pure in this world anymore and home is one of the few."     It's been a rough 24, and tonight starts the goodbye process for my cousin who is moving to Hawaii.   "I feel home when I see the faces that remember my own."    "Feelin alright, heading out tonight..."   Exactly.  Last night wasn't enough, although the girls nights always seem to make me smile.   "Well in the end we can all call a friend well that's something I know is true.  And then a thousand years and a thousand tears, I'll come back to my original crew."
