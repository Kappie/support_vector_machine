I'm in my house... all alone... and scary moving people are outside the window! *smile and run* Nah it's ok really, my neighbours are moving. It's really tight on their kids, they were crying the other day :( poor kiddies. Must be really stressful. I don't really want to find out what it's like. Isn't it really weird to think that your parents, the people who have been together all your life could split up? That would really make me question the stability in relationships or some thing like that... But don't! Relationships are good... relationships are good.
