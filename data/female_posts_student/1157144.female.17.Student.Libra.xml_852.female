I, however, wrote an email to the head of construction at the district, making sure that I hinted at my *powerful* position on the advisory board.  Eight working days after I emailed him, he came up to me and said that he had sent me an email of what the sign could say... but I never responded (I never checked oops!) so he went ahead and ordered a sign that he liked.  Wham.  My ass got Branham a sign.  Obviously, I'm a more respected mover and shaker than Jones.  So... if ya need anything done... just pay me off :)  lol that was fun
