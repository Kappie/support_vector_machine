New clothes. new attitude, ne hair, etc. Before, my style was preppy and laid back. I want to go edgy... not gothic, but kinda punk. Not all the way yet... but I need a change. Me and Drew are ok, i guess. I mean, we are talking and not yelling at each other. So, thats a good thing. Things wont be back to what they used to... but I wish they were. I miss him. Not as a boyfriend (even tho we had good times) but as a best friend... Today I went shopping with my mom, we got to bond a little bit. She was on the phone alot, which kinda was weird. But oh well. She said she was going to stop by tomorrow to see the girls. That will be fun. Well, thats all for now.
