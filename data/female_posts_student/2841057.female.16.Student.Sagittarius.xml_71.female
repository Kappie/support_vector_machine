Luckily, my prof allowed me to get the exam and just tell our tiny proctor to write the "no permit" mark in my test paper. Anyway...it's not an ordinary day. hehe...cause I came home so early that I still got the chance to watch a movie. Our exam tomorrow will be ics and philosophy. I'm quite nervous, not because of the test but because I still don't have the permit and if the proctor will allow me to take the exam. Where is that f--kn student's copy which I need to get a permit. I've been at the osa and dean's office but it wasn't there..whatta h--. They told me that I'm supposed to get it two weeks after the first day of school but I missed it. But then, there are also other students who missed to get it but when they came back yesterday, it's there. Where's my damn copy! Sh-t I need it! Grrr... I need to go to the osa again to ask if I can get another copy and just give the requirements. Huhh... Too tired for this. I need a rest and a time to review. See yah!
