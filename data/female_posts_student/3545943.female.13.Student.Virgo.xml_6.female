It's so easy to fool the world, mostly because the world is willing to be fooled.  Everyone seems to want their own rose-coloured glasses.  Why are there so few people that look out beyond their own meager lives and realise the truth?    I figure if a random stranger such as  urlLink "The Reactor"  (That is, assuming it  is  some random stranger) can steal the "currents" from her blog, I can too.  I steal a lot from Elm.  Current: Knitting project: still the cardigan Reading material:  The Lord of the Rings  (again) and  A People's History of the United States  by Howard Zinn Greatest desire that cannot be fufilled:  To escape and live on my own Greatest frustration:  People that can't see beyond the walls of their own lives Inspiration:  People like Elm and  urlLink VW , people that can put a ton of emotion into writing or art Plans for the future:  If you mean besides camp next week, a family reunion a couple weeks after that, and school in the fall, I got nothing. Focus in life: Ha. Attitude toward the whole of humankind: disgust Completely illogical desire:  pain Thing that I wish I could sit down and do but feel incapable of doing: working on my novel, drawing (I'm a little intimidated to go back after a four month break from the last thing in my sketchbook), cleaning my room (Okay, I wouldn't be sitting.  But that's beside the point.) Physical condition: on the poor side of fair Mental condition: good Emotional condition: Is it necessarily good to be happy?
