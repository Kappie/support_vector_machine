Everything was fine actually, I got to the pool this morning, and I didn't vacuum because it was raining, and the rain was just going to cause more stuff to fall into the pool. So I sat there for a while, then a friend of mine showed up, and we hung out for a while, until another guy came, who swims like everyday. We were all hanging out and some chicks came and then these other people came. And they had like, 15 kids with them, which wasn't a problem. Everyone I saw was in their swimwear, except the first little girl who went in. Well I stopped her and told her that she couldn't swim in them, because they were not white shorts. Well her mom or whatever was like, no she has to swim in them or they will be seethrough. And she had a serious additude, and ya know, I let things slide half the time, but her additude just set me off. I said well I guess she can't swim then. And she started in on me at that point, and I was like, don't come up here talking to me like that, I run this pool and I don't have to let you swim in it. It's my decision and I don't have to take anything from you. So she was like, well we're going to go to the board and you'll see how long your job lasts. I just laughed, because I knew she couldn't get me fired or anything. So I called my boss and told her everything, and then they showed back up, just the one I got into it with and she brought another person. And the other person was like, are you the one mouthing my family? I was like, no, I simply told them the little girl couldn't swim with her shorts. They were not regular swimware, nor were they white. Well she had a problem with that and blah blah blah. Well then she was like, who is your grandma? I was like, you don't know my grandma. She was like, where is Sherly(which is the girl who ran the pool last year, who also has granddaughters, I'm just not one of them.) And I told her that Sherly no longer ran the pool this year, and she would have to take it up with the person who does. Well they left and later the board members came and talked to me, and they were totally fine. And they were basically, you know its a judgement call, and I said yea, if they had been nice I would have let the little girl swim. But they started in the second I said anything. And they acted rude when I checked to see if they had paid their dues, which I have to do. How should I know if they are paid or not? Ya know. But I didn't say anything when they did that, I let it slide. Well the board members were totally fine with everything, and my boss was like...no you're not getting fired. Lol, which I wasn't worried about..but ya know.  Well!!! Thats about all...too bad Aaron couldn't come today, I had wanted to talk to him about that last night...but it didn't work out too well.
