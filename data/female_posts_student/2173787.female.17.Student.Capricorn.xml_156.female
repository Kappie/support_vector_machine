Open mic night...Wow, I can't really come up with much else convertible...Loud, shiny, red Auto flirt...hmm autoflirt...  so on to the portion of really bad limericks (I had hannah's assistance):   Limerick warning for photosynthetic organisms   While you're out having fun in the sun, Your cells are becoming well done-- UV-B is bad, And makes you mad-- And ruins your fun in the sun.  UV-B makes your cells fry, Which makes the consumers die-- UV-B is bad, And makes you mad-- So why don't you just say bye-bye?  The hole in the ozone is growing, People cause this without knowing UV-B is bad,  And makes you mad-- So, to your graves you're going.
