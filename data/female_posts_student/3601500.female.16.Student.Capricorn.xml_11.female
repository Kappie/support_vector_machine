And rant. A LOT. I guess I'll also post things I write or draw.  Honestly, I don't see why anyone would be interested in my life, but anyway - I have to finish my cake, and will post later.  (If I seem dull, it's because I haven't slept more than 6 hours in the last month... and now I should be doing homework).
