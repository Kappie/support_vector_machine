You see, I am always addicted to the internet and when  i am always using it I become I lazy head and I find that I start to ignore God. Which is BAD!  So on tuesday at youth group I kinda woke up and I was like "Wow...I am  a jerk. I always say I am so busy..and I never find time for God or even homework but I am on the internet  all day."  So I am quiting the internet and every waking moment is for God.
