Beck: "Lost Cause"     (just a great tune - i keep this one just for me) Casey Chambers: "The Captain"  (memories of beach parties) Enya: Random Enya songs that help chill me out  So i've got kind of a cool room.  they have put me at the far end of the "L" shaped monstronsity that is their home.  i've got a balcony which is by far the best part.  there is something about being ouside on a beautiful night when no one is around. there is a gentle breeze, and it is just cool enough to make me put on a sweatshirt over my tank top.  and i just sit there, listening to music, not listening; not really thinking (a welcomed change), just being, feeling the ebb and flow of the breeze, the whisper of the leaves, just being, and for the first time in a while, it feels okay to just be.  dare i say i nearly felt connected to something, in some way.  perhaps i've just become delusional and am out of emotion.  emotionally bankrupt, that is me.  well not bankrupt, drained, perhaps?  connecticut is an unusual place.  i think i need to travel somewhere for at least part of the summer.  how the hell am i going to meet people without school?  time for some enya and sleep.
