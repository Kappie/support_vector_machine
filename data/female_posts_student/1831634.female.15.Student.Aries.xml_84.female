I'll probably end up dead, trying.  Ah, well, at least I died fighting.  I love being a martyr!  That is the coolest word.  I can never pronunce it, though.  That freaking English exams was inordinately hard.  It was so impossible.  The answer choices were so close, it was beyond crazy.  I wanted to stab Mrs. Lux.  But then I got a 100 on my life lesson book, so I was happy.  Which means that for once, I'll have an A+ in that class for a six weeks!  I am beyond amazed.  Miracles DO happen!  This morning I was avoiding the commapps room like the plague.  DID NOT want to step into that room.  I hate that room with such a fierce passion.  I went to Byers tutorials in the morning.  It helped me zippo.  I saw Jack there (both of them), and I realized that they were both gits.  So there goes the end of that situation.  THEEEEEN.  Kailing wouldn't sign my yearbook!  And she signed CHUAN'S.  Geez.  Just that name annoys me.  I will not speak of it any further.  Kailing!  How COULD you?  I mean... we're like THIS CLOSE!  And it's your own fault for not signing my yearbook earlier when there were bunches of blank pages.  I am very disappointed in you.  Let us get off that topic now.  I must study for bio with my lovely Lisa Ying-Ying Wang!  =D  I would like to meet this Camille Bagby person.  I have heard from several sources that she is very very hot.  I hope I get classes with her next year!  In English today, I was looking at people's toenails.  Tiantian has painted hers this lovely shade of turquoise.  And it's metallic, too!  So it sparkled in the sun and made me not concentrate on my exam.  Which is bad.  Then I looked at Christine (Cepelak)'s toenails.  They were clear with these sparkly foil things in them.  Like confetti!  And they sparkled, too.  So I was surrounded by sparkly toenails!  And Christine's fingernails were sparkly, too.  I was sparkled to death.  Then on my bus ride home with Yini, I talked to her about gene frequencies and who would have pretty babies together.  From a purely biological point of view, of course.  I have decided that if Jack and I were somehow to combine our genes and create a baby, it would be the most demented baby in the world.  I mean, really.  Our traits mashed together then divided?  I think not.  It would turn out to be a Frankensteinesque baby.  The poor thing.  Then I thought about Ning and _____.  They would have either the wimpiest or stubbornest child in the world.  In either case, I think it serves both of them right, so I really hope they procreate together.  I will not go into the details about other people that I have discussed, for those other people will be prone to kill me.  And I want to live.  Now I will go reread Ender's Shadow and wallow in my hatred some more.
