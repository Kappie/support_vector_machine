Rocker1821: if i died? i chung you: yeah i chung you: ?Rocker1821: no i wouldnt cry i chung you: why not? Rocker1821: cuz i would be in heaven.    okay tomorrow we are going to go to the thrift store because i need to. so yeah. be ready.    ew my straightening balm is drying crispy and needs to be fixed!!   i like the new copeland song.   i want to write my own songs for guitar and i'm trying it's just not working out easily.   if we don't go to the thrift store tomorrow, i'm going to start my schooltime renovations on my clothing. meaning i'm going to take everything out, sort through whether or not i want it, and then organize it back in the drawers. which also means it's going to become a disaster area. yay!   then after the aforementioned happens, i can make a list of amazing clothing i want for school.  i believe aforementioned is one of the coolest words i've ever used properly.   hopefully that's a word.
