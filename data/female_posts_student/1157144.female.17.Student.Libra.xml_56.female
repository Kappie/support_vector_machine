Further notes: AP hist was easy! selfridge let us down! (ok, maybe not)...bio was easy too...and english was the hardest of the day, with those annoying quotes, especially the last ones from the poem. @maggie/jenny: i hate you. both of you. greatly. and i have no relations with adam!! and, as a special presentation, this is what burnside said to me today (copied from an IM with jenny)  Thirteen Master (4:09:24 PM): o, guess what burnside said to me when i came back with my journals for her to check? Riceinmynose (4:10:00 PM): neway what did she say? Thirteen Master (4:10:43 PM): i had counted them beforehand to make sure they were all there...and i gave it to her, and i said "there's 19 there"...and i expected her to count, just to make sure...instead she says "jason, you're anal-retentive and meticulous enough that you wouldn't lie to me, so i'll just take your word for it" and gives it back Riceinmynose (4:11:15 PM): 0_0 she SAID that to u???? Riceinmynose (4:11:16 PM): omg Riceinmynose (4:11:21 PM): did u think it was funny? Riceinmynose (4:11:29 PM): i mean i would have been pissed as helll Riceinmynose (4:11:44 PM): but maybe i took it wrong? Thirteen Master (4:11:52 PM): no, i gave her a look, kim started laughing, but i thought it was pretty funny Thirteen Master (4:12:00 PM): it was actually a compliment as to my honesty  studying for trig, blah! when you have a 97%, you don't need to study!!
