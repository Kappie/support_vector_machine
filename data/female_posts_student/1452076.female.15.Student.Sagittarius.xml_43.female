Learnt about the three angels' message versus the three frogs' message in Revelations (Woo, big chapter!) from Auntie Pik Yee.    Had my first bible study lesson with Bee Guang after lunch.    Managed to go for band BBQ at yasi's house. The honeyed sausages and satays were tasty!    Met Pinhao on my way there. Been a while since I last saw him but couldn't stay to chit-chat because he was in the middle of a basketball game.    Saw Xiefen and some of her HCJC friends in the study room beside us. Holy hell, I never imagined that I would actually meet someone who was a more intensive bridge player than me and my classmates. But there they were sitted around a square table holding poker cards for more than four solid hours. They ate alot too, helped us to finish Ms. Chong's large birthday cake!    Made friends with Yingxu's brother, Xiao xiao/Edward/Juju. (I still don't know his real name.) Cute little Pri. 6 boy. We played a little catch and soccer with Zhuo Jing and Joanna, since everyone else were just busy barbequeing or eating.    Reached home at 11, couldn't do any homework.
