WELL when she finds a hole in ur fence (when ur mom makes u stick her in the fenced in yard while u leave for the day with the other dog) and goes into the neighbors fenced in yard with their 2 HUGE dogs. Alright..so i had to chase her around until i caught her, not exactly, she found a drain pipe thingie and goes into it every time i go near her. Some dog...she loves me...yeah. lol im sure. UGH i swear when i catch her shes gettin a bath cuz she STINKS still and shes gonna stay in her crate and not go outside!! ugh. lol i'll take her out on a leash for her to go to the bathroom geez, but im not chasing her to timbuktu and back. She just needs to be socialized..fuck who ever left her in a pin all by herself and didnt play with her. Poor pup, all she knows is dogs and not people. :( OH WELL. i'm gonna make this thing into a good dog even if she only wags her tail when my other dog walks into the room instead of me...
