I WENT TO YALE, OK? Really, I'm not that cranky. I am still of the persuasion that it's not better than Harvard, except the only thing that might tip the scales (slightly, mind you) is the fact that their residential colleges are awesome. To be trite: imagine Harry Potter. And put that in New Haven. It's just so nice: old stone buildings, courtyards with flowers, benches. The admissions officer who talked to us, Jim Nondorf, was amazing. You meet so few of those charismatic, successful people in your life that you just have to sit in awe. Funny thing: right when we got off the bus, they asked us if any of us wanted to get a Yale interview right then and there since they had six slots open, and Jenn and I wanted to...Jenn's ID card was drawn, so she got one. It's just scary to think that the college application process is so close at hand.  What almost annoys me, though, is the fact that so many people think they're worthy of Yale. Or any Ivy league, for that matter. I mean, the Yale average SAT score for the last class was 1500, which is absolutely amazing, but how many of these people can fulfill those requirements? Or come close, at least? In this case, Jenn puts it perfectly: it's like you've been working hard all this time and when other people who have put in less effort think they're going to reap the same benefits, it just angers you, because that's not why you worked so hard. I think Harvard SSP has mislead many people in thinking that they're of Harvard caliber, and they're obviously not. It's reassuring? nice? scary? to think that only a small percentage of the people here will actually get into Harvard, but that's the way it's really supposed to be. And I guess if it's hrad, it's not like I can really complain. I work, we all work...if we don't make it over that bar, we can only blame ourselves (or maybe the idiosyncrasies of the college admissions system...). It's just weird hearing people with 3.5 GPA's and average personality (and whatever can be derived from outward judgment like that) saying they're going to apply to all the Ivies. What, to get...rejected?  I'm not being nice. I'm sure one day someone in the high heavens will wield their thunderbolt and strike me down for being so irreverent and such a bitchy, pompous ass.  Well, I got my AP scores today...I can sleep at night again.  See, the weird thing is, I feel like I've been very, very lucky so far. I don't have much to complain about: I have a wonderful family and a great network of friends. Material needs, within reason, have been satisfied. I do things that make me happy. I get good results. It's just...you have to think, when does all this fairy tale end? Will everything just crumble when I get rejection letter upon rejection letter come December and April? Is it really luck? Or have I been working hard and not noticing it?  Most of the time, I can't disturb this aura of felicity and I'll just let it be, but now I wonder, how far is this going to get me? Is this a good enough edge for all those Ivy wannabes? Have I just been a snot all this time and I'm just going to get a handy lesson next spring?  I should be humbler too. I really want to be that classic Harvard student walking down the street with a book bag and a respectable look about her face. Call me weird, but that's as far as my dreaming goes nowadays. It's not future riches or relationships or anything like that, it's GETTING INTO MY TOP-CHOICE COLLEGE.  How demented is that? Especially when I promised myself I wouldn't think about college this summer?  Success is just the greatest feeling in the world. Tempering it is just as important as the attainment of success.  I have a lot of reading this weekend. Argh.
