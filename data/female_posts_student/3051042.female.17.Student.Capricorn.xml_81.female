So it was my mom's b-day. I went out this afternoon, after having coffee with Dad, Opa, and Mom at Espresso Royale, and bought her some flowers after picking Mike up. Mike and I hung out and he got a hold of Nick. We picked Nick up from Kettering. Got lost on I-75, don't ask. They talked about cars, I sat there... and sat there... and sat there.   And sat there... you thought it was over didn't you?  Got back around 7-something. Picked April up and went to my house. My mom got pissed at me for dumb shit, but I'm too tired to explain.  Went to Pub 13 at 9pm to celebrate her b-day. I think I came across as a whinny bitch tonight. Oh well...   I've decided that my week doesn't suck, but my life just sucks in general. Hey Tiki, at least we have something in common. I'm just feeling worthless right now.  Ok, true feelings of the night: I don't really think anyone cares really. Not at all. I could just fall off the face of the earth and it really wouldn't matter. How long would it take to get over it? Really... Well, maybe Mike is right, I'm just a sadistic pessimist.   I dropped April off at her place at 10pm and then didn't really feel like being alone. I gave Q a call, headed over to hang with him for a few. Saw him but didn't stay that long. Went home... ended up alone anyway.   It's really too bad that I care so much about you but you don't give a flying fuck about me. Maybe it's a show... at this moment, I think not.  Maybe things will be better in the morning.
