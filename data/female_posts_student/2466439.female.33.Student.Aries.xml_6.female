I was wondering today if this is a good idea or not.  I mean, I guess it is too late to wonder about it.  Since I already bought an engagement ring, asked her to marry, moved my belongings and my dog into the house, and have been paying rent.  Of course, it is rather typical of me to pick this time to wonder if I am doing the right thing.  Why worry ahead of time when you can worry when it is way too late?  Ah, well.  I pushed off my worries some more tonight playing  urlLink Puzzle Pirates .  I have become somewhat addicted to the game, for all that I am crap at the puzzles.    I have another fricking cold sore.  You would think with the massive evil cold sore I had over Thanksgiving, my body would give me a break.  But I have another one.  Smaller, thankfully, but still.  I signed up for the ACA conference in San Francisco.  And I started scouting out good bars.  I am tempted to drop Laurie an email just to say hi and find out where to go.  Perhaps this is not the brightest idea I have had, emailing the ex-girlfriend when I am about to head out there.  The conference is in February.  Or at least it is if I still have my camp job.  I guess that is going to depend on how that interview goes.  *crosses fingers*
