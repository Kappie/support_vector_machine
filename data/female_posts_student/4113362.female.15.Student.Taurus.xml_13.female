Today was extremely eventful and yet extremely...I don't know. We went to the parade. It was 2000 degrees and I thought I was going to die. My mom left us there becuase she couldn't find us at the park and got sick of looking..so Stephy and I had to wait outside my cousins car on the side of the road for numerous hours to see if she eventually got around to coming back to her car to give us a ride. Then we went to my Grandparents...We fell asleep for like an hour. Damnit. We broke the beautiful cycle of no sleep. It's o kay though, I don't blame myself. Anyone would have slept at the Grandparents house. It's just so damn comfy. Tonight..we went to the fireworks. It was interesting but wet and tooo many people. Being around large groups of people is not my friend. The Gramma promised me waffles for breakfast. Does she know how long I've been craving waffles? :D Ohh...waffles. I must go to bed now so the waffles will come sooner. LoL   *~Night-Night to Myself~*
