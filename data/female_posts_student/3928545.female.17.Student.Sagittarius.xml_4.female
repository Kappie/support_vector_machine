I'll bet you $5 that I'll call my mom sobbing. I'm such a baby. I know it's like a year away and I probably shouldn't be worrying about it too much at this point, but today it kind of set in. And I know for sure that I'll either gain 400 lbs or become anorexic. I'm not sure which. When I get really nervous I can't eat at all, but since there will be good food (there's a Taco Bell!!!) I may just devour everything within a 25 mile radius. Okay, I'm going to shut up now, it's summer.
