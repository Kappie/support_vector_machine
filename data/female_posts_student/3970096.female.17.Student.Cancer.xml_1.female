I've just been going through some of my chat    files for MSN... well in particular one that belongs to an old friend that i dont speak to anymore...   was i really that blind to see all this? why did she do this at all? im very lucky to have gotten out now...   or it could have been alot worse. but i am lucky to have someone to keep me standing up stright through   all this... and im very, oh so very greatful!   thankyou so much, i love you!      Well to next time blogger...as my king would say...   Fair Thee Well!
