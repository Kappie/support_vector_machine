Music in the half shell, cosmic bowling (as many highly respected 11th graders enjoy), floating the river, and now even my school, have been pleauged.  With middle schoolers.  I know what you are thinking.  "HELLO, you were that age just a few short years ago" but I really DO NOT think I ever acted like that.  I just don't see it happening.  They have just recentley started to out number the high schoolers, and I am getting scared.  I can't go anywhere without seeing a group or two of jr. high aged kids, just trying to be cool, and fit in, but some of the things you see them doing...wow.  I can say that becuase my brother is in 8th grade, and as a reslut of that I am usually surrounded by these uh-human creatures.  I don't understand how they think.  They walk around like, "yeah, I'm cool..." but they aren't.  They are just young kids who are stopping at nothing to be accepted.  Middle School is a time of change.  Everyone is trying to figure out how they want to act, who they want to become, and so I guess they are entitled to being a little wired.  But, when it gets to the point that people are wondering what planet these creatures are from, its too much.  I am sick of hearing about partys that these kids who are 12 and 13 are having.  It makes me sad to realize that there are a lot of things these kids are doing that could and most likey will ruin there lives.  Most pre-teens today don't stop at anything to "be cool", and it's sad.  So I guess I am just asking for input.  Is is just me, or are the jr. highers of today crazier than we were?  Is it just me, or are they going a little bit TOO FAR.
