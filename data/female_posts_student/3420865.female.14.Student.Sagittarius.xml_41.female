(sleepover...girls  and guys . excited? kindof...more nervous though. should be fun, i hope.) so yes. we're staying at her house until monday morning i think, then she's coming with me and my mum to our grandparents' house...we're apparently all going to see a show (like a play thing...singing in the rain? or sound of music? something to do with music/singing.) so i get to get dressed up...which should be fun. then my grandparents are driving me and my mum back to my aunt's house here in london...aaah i hope i have an awesome time.      well, i'm out. paice.      ever so sweet,   you baked it in cakes for me.      kayte.      p.s. my barely one-year-old cousin, matthew, (the sweetest baby/human in the world) just climbed a whole flight of stairs (by himself) for the first time. then we clapped for him...and he clapped for himself. he's the most adorable baby in the world...seriously. cutest thing alive.
