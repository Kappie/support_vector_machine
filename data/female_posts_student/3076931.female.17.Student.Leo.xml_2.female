Crazy that he can always somehow be the topic of almost every entry I write. Does that mean I'm thinking about him too much? hmmm.. So I sit here..and I'm waiting for him to come over...like he said he was. Which is awful..I don't know if I should be waiting eagerly with anticipation or waiting with dread. What I'm doing is SO wrong..and I know it..and that's the bad thing. But I'm doing it anyways. HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND, TRINA! It's so hard for me not to give into temptation. Why can't he not have a girlfriend? then I wouldn't have to deal with all this guilt. why did he even have to tell me he had one? well I guess it's good that he did...cuz I'd be pissed if I found out later that he had a girlfriend. Oh well..as far as we're concerned we are just friends. Good friends. No more. right? right. right. right. RIGHT. aghhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Sometimes I wonder if he's sober or not when we talk on the phone. he's all into the drugs and shit..which worries me. and its not like the average guy..where he only does it a little...it's like his way of life.  He does it WAY too much..and I do NOT need to deal with a druggie. bah. oh well. everything will work itself out. hopefully. i'll be waiting for it to work out and all fall into place.
