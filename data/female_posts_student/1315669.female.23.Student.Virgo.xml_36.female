I remembered that day when I went for my orientation I almost freaked out at the things we have to do JUST to get that bloody pharmacist cert. WTF. Can you believe that we have to pay a damn $80 just to register with the Pharmacy Board for this training??? And we have to pay another $200 plus to RENEW our pharmacist license every damn year just to sustain our livelihood. KNN.  Sg Govt money really damn hard to earn. SI BEH KIAM MAN.   Sighz. Well, by God's grace, I was granted to work for 3 months in Lot 1 CCK which is freaking near my place. Despite the freaking screwed up working hours, I was blessed with really nice working collegues and my pharmacist there was really nice to me. Well, beat that! My ex classmate now is a pharmacist there too!( there are 2 pharmacists maintaining the shift per pharmacy). At least working there had been very pleasant and I got to interact with my juniors which are in that BASTARD's class. *pardon for the foul lang*   A long time fren called me from oveseas ytd and I was pleasantly surprised. =]  Haven't heard from him for quite a while and the last time I talked to him online, he was in the midst of his exams and some screwed up r/s probs and he was deeply depressed. Glad that now, at least he felt a bit more sane. Was chatting with him online again just now and realized that this close guy fren of mine has been covering up his private life from me. *luffs* Well, if anyone read the previous entries I think you guys know who I'm refering to. Just felt a tad amused by the fact that he told me his gf wasn't allowed to stay overnite at his place cos it was forbidden by his parents when apparently, this fren of mine told me that gf has "moved in" to his place and literally almost cohabitating with him!   You know guys, somehow I just felt that when u become too protective of ur frens, it backfires and u lose not one but all of them. I felt I have lost 2 of my close frens just by being a middle person. It saddens me deeply that my concern has ingrained seeds of jealousy and of grudges in her heart. And it saddens me even further to know the other party does nothing to remedy much of the situation to make things better..it was almost as though our frenship din worth much. So much so for those times when we were there for one another and having given each other shoulders to cry on. Sighz. Human love is so selfish eh? It is so easily mislead. So easily blinded by earthly and material distractions. I'm even more convinced now that God is the only one who loves me son uncondtionally. Who accepts who I am even when I have done wrong. Being the perfect teacher, partner, lover and my best fren. Whatever it is, I think God also taught me a lesson with these 2 frens in my life; as a fren, we can only afford that much help. We can try to protect the ones whom we care and whom we deemed important but the path to be walked lies destined in the lives of each individual. If we do not allow ourselves to fall and climb up again, we never will. Similarly, never impose what u deemed to be correct in dealing with matters of the heart your way for each person requires a unique blend of life. So, never say the person loves the wrong way. For u might not be living the right way too.   I guess I owe both of my 2 frens this deep apology from the bottom of my heart, I sincerely wish both of u happiness and deep regrets for the discontentment I caused in ur lives.    Oh well...   Haven slpt well in days. Waking up several times in the night for the past 2-3 weeks. Drinking a glass of wine now hoping I will loosen up and have a good night UNDISTURBED slp later on. I'm sick of waking up in the midst of the night only to see the sky is still dark and I'm waking up to lonliness.Dunno what is wrong with me. Dunno if it's because of alot of things going on in my mind or what( can't seemed to think that I'm specifically thinking of anything in particular). Just plain sick of restless nights. My baby already complaining I'm catching up in age wiht him. Tmd. Sighz.. Oh well. Hope this drink helps..haven drank in quite a while liao..   Have a good night dudes and babes out there. Muacks!
