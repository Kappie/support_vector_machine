LOL, then Jessica (B) was the first to arrive.  people started sprinkling in.. then we got a big game of catchphrase going, followed by Mafia.  oh it was fun.  then the married couple showed up.   We played Mafia one more time.. and then most of the people went home around 10:15-ish.  Not too long after they left, Chad got there just in time to see everyone and then say goodbye.  We had our "after hours party" and played cards and watched food network... he left at about 1:30... 20 min ago.. and i am exauhsted.  Tomorrow i have plenty to do with shopping and whatnot.  Also... 11 o'clock bells.  Oh it's going to be hard to get up.  Goodnight Sleeptight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite.
