We read this text yesterday and I comprehended most of it with the exception of several words. Today we learned what all those words meant.. but I didn't realise that they were the word from the text until I did my homework today. When I reread the text I knew every word!!! Waht a thrill.    The othe rcool thing about ulpan is that today, I had frined to sit with. that's right, I"m beaming :)      AFter ulpan I bumped into this guy who I had given directions to in the morning. He's a new OSP student and since the office was closed I offered to take him to the bookstore. SO we went on a little adventure. He's a kickboxer but he seemed to be very adverse to capoeria. I thought there was soemthing a little.. pushy or abrupt about him.. then he told me he was going into the American military. yup. that' explains it.       We returned to the dorms and parted ways. Michal was i the room when I got there. I shouwed her my hebrew books and hten she encouraged me to do my homeowrkd so that I could hlep. and while I did myhomework she made me lunch! and bought me chocoalte! I honestly didn't know what to expect form israelis... i thought they would be ruder but they are SO INCREDIBLY NICE, not just Michal but everyone's roommate seem to be super super super. Anwyas had an increidble bonding afternoon with Michal. I ended up doinga ll my homeowrk wrong but she helped me understand why.       Then Igot a phone call from Ben asking if I wanted to go to Canion Hanegev to go to Zara. So Alona, Ben and I hopped into a cap and booted over to the mal! I thought about my last Zara excusrion with Sarah and Leah, and about shopping bonanza with Sara, Lyssa and Brett. Ben and ALona make fun of my Canadianism. They are super super nice. I don't.. but I really feel like ALona is going to be my first real friend ( I"m such a nerd eh?).      Tonight there is a lecutre on AFrica Diaspora (YES!!!! my tpoic of hcoice!!)/ So you knwo what that means.... NO BORING NIGHT!!!!! and guess what.. please applaud. last night... I sleep through the whole thigns without waking up.       I HAVE ARRIVED!!!!!!
