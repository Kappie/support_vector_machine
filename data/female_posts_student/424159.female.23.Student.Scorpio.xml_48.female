JLC needs to realize that I'm not her bitch, her permanent dishwasher, or her loan center that accepts rediculously late payments of her phone bill share.  I'm a pretty relaxed and free spirit, but if provoked, I WILL go to war, battle face paint and all.  Enough is enough;  My buttons have been pushed repeatedly and they're getting warn out.  I'll move on to the pleasant abnormalites now, since they outweigh the normailites.  I'm starting a band with this dude named Matt.  Matt and I are very excited about this band, and I hope it prospers.  I'll, of course, be playing guitar and Matt will sing, maybe even play bass if we can't find a bass player.  No band name or material has emerged yet, but I feel confident that we'll do OK.  I looked in my mailbox Saturday to find my X-Ray license.  I'm very excited, for this opens considerably good options as far as employment.  In a nod to my current job, Nitia finally came back to her weekend spot and I couldn't be happier.  I missed her authoritarianism and inspiring ass-kickings involving doctors and other health care members.  I owe my no-nonsense attitude to her.  Welcome back, Nish!  Last, but not least, I'm getting ANOTHER guitar.  I'm building this one myself though.  I ordered all the parts from Warmoth.  The body is Alder wood and the neck is all maple, with the huge 70's headstock.  I'm leaving the body plain, no paint.  It's also going to have all black hardware (EVERYTHING black, even the pickguard and pickup covers).  I gutted my old shit-kicker Strat copy and I'm going to use all the electronics from it for my new guitar.  I can't wait!  Well, I think I've explained myself pretty well.  Before I go, I have a few last words, concerning the current situation in Iraq.  FUCK WAR AND FUCK BUSH!
