I'll probably work on it later tonight. Hopefully I'm gonna go play tennis today since I did nothing yesterday (not excercise anyways... very unlike myself). I found this really cool website though that you can basically take a tour of Europe on and I used a bunch of my favorite pictures to make a screen saver   urlLink  http://www.concierge.com/destination/europe         Anyways I'm still waiting for people to contact me about being an au pair next year... I check constantly even though it probably won't be for a while since it's a whole year a way an most people don't seem to be looking yet for that time period. I really hope it works out, I'm obsessed right now, but I usually get like that about stuff.    I'm gonna get going, I hope it's sunny and warm today so I can go to the lake and play some tennis outside, maybe beach vball too. GOD BLESS
