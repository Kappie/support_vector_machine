I actually slept in until 11:11 AM and now I feel sick : \      So today I'll tell you a few select thoughts that are racing around my mind trying to make as much sense as possible (as always).   By the way, I'm having a bit of trouble tyeping today because while I was making my little brother (he's 11) some macaroni and cheese I burned my hand on boiling water. so i apologize for any typos.      Anyway...while I was in New York I saw two broadway shows, one of which was Aida. If you don't know the story line then here is a brief synopsis:    urlLink Aida    So that synopsis wasn't exactly brief but it is shorter than every single detail.       Of the three broadway shows I have ever seen, so far it is my favorite by a landslide. Besides the reincarnation stuff which I don't believe in but brought closure to the whole story, it was amazingly beautiful. Let me first admit that I am secretly a hopeless romantic. Just kidding...idk what I am classified as but this love story made me cry at the end. Combine any good (sad) story with beautiful music and you'll probably be able to get me to cry. But it was REALLY REALLY REALLY good. Even better was that it was based on a true story. That fact alone makes me start to cry a little bit. It was just that awesome. In the beginning few numbers I didn't like the music very much but it got better. Deborah A. Cox and Adam Pascal were both amazing so it added to the whole effect in the end. I don't know what it is about this story that it just makes me envy people in love. I know, I know, I'm too young to care (and all that other stuff they tell you if you say anything) but I'm just very lonely. So I guess it's not exactly romantic love that I'm looking for it's more like the love of friendship. I don't have any friends. I have acquaintances or half-friends--a.k.a. people who are nice but don't want to really have anything to do with me outside of school or choir or soccer or whatever even when I ask them. So I guess I should just end this post. I have too many things to say and not enough space or peace/organization of mind.
