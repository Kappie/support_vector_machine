So then at 8:00 this morning it goes off, but i am so not used to having an alarm i roll over turn it off and go back to sleep. Then I wake up at  9:45  as in fifteen minutes before I have to be at work. So basically i wake up and am like "FUCK!!!" i took about a three second shower. Ran downstairs grabbed some money for lunch shoved shoes on my feet and speed walked all the way down to the library. I was like ten minutes late. shh. My boss didn't notice. So I spent an ungodly boring 5 hours. Well it wasn't too bad cuz i was working with rachel, i.e. like the ONLY other paige that talks to me. haha anyway. Yeah I made long fake nails out of stickers I found in the cabinet underneath the desk. They say "Access Pennsylvania" yeah I don't know what that's supposed to mean either. Yeah so then I start walking home, in rain. But Rachel stopped and was like "i'll give you a ride home." and i was like "GOD BLESS YOU"
