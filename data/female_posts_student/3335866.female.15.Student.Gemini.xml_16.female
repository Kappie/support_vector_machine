Sorry. I just wanted to get your attention. I know you've never gotten to see an ad like that, and you're curious about what they're like.I'm you,so I know stuff like that.   Now, you've been feeling a little down. You're sad that people have been ignoring your site and stuff like that. You thought that your natural talentwith the written word would make you known throughout the Blogger community and, like cream, your site would rise to the top.   Well, you're not that delusional. You only thought that on the days when you'd gotten an 'A' in English and you were hormonal with a swelled head. But still.   Now, there's some stuff that you should remember (and this goes for all unlucky-in-popularity writers as well). Whenever you're feeling down, just think of the fact that  urlLink Pamela Ribon  used to give away her writing to boys, and she thought her high school diaries were excruciating.  urlLink The Bell Jar  almost didn't get published.  urlLink Anthony Bourdain  had two nobody-ever-heard-of-'em novels before hitting it big. And  urlLink J. K. Rowling  was a single mother with, I believe, nothing published.   And even if it doesn't work outin the end, the world isn't over. There are still a hundred million options left to you. You can be a chef, a teacher, a lawyer, an interior decorator, a doctor, a janitor, a stand-up comic, or whatever. And you can tell theuniverse about it through the internet. Best of both worlds, just for you.   Now, this might not be very reassuring. The depressed among you might find this pathetically perky and a poor representation of melancholy. But this isn't for you, is it? Now Poire, in the end it doesn't matter whether or not this gets read. In a hundred years, who will care? At least you'll have a record of your high school days, and you'll get some writing practice that doesn't involve what you did on your summer vacation.   And personally, I bet Viagra ads are totally overrated. Bob Dole,  who ?   Best wishes,  Your Self
