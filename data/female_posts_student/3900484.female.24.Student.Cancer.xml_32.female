In case not, the movie we went out to see was Princess D. # 2.  It was fairly good.  I like the new love interest.  I didn't think it was laugh-out-loud hilarious, but apparently some old people a seat over and behind me and  urlLink libprincess  did.  The lady kept laughing so loud, I thought she might die.  I didn't think her heart could take it.  It would have made my movie viewing experience more enjoyable had she and her husband not been there.  I wanted to kill them both with my bare hands, and maybe my nail clippers, by the end of the movie. Her husband, I thought was cracking his nails for a while.  No no, it was the lid of his freakin' water bottle he kept screwing on and off.  Im not even sure there was any water left, it was like he was just playing with it.  Die Die Die. That's my happy thought for this early in the morning.  Death to all the morons that think they have the theater to themselves when it is actually semi-full. Long day tomorrow.  9 hours at work and orientation and all.  Ugh.  I think I have to look nice, too.
