Mikki and I spent hours trying to figure out what the fuck was wrong with it. But to no avail. So I'm made a new one. Ain't it pretty?  In the mean time, Here are some pretty pictures.  My google search for Zombies/Dead People/Gross Stuff.     This makes me head hurt.    Mmmm.....isn't he/she a looker?    Haha, this makes me laugh.    Eww, that's disgusting. Lunch anyone?    So freah and so clean clean. ( the guy was killed in his bathroom, get the joke?)    Jesus Christ. OH man, I can't even think.    DROOLS    Hey baby, can I get your number?     I wish I could do that *sulks*]    This one is for you Mikki!     Holy Christ Wagons...this bitch is smokin'!    Okay, so I strayed a little. Oh screw it, you wanna look at nekkid ladies just as much as me. So now I'm gonna go look at porn.  I'm so out. Jenks
