Its soooo fun!! Its basicly tetres but it has groovy music and a anime face in the corner :D  Eh, I kinda ordered too many books off amazon, now I have to ask dad whenever I order something xD I ordered them right, like one each week, but I didn't keep track of how much they cost :l  Oh yea, we had a massive thunder storm though. I used to be really scared of thunder, but I'm kinda ok about it now. Its kinda fun xD But not when its right above the house :l  Waaaa Its reeeeally hot :(:(:(:( I can't wait to go on holiday. It'll be cool in Scotland. Well, it'll probably be freezing, but I like cold better than hot. I hope it doesn't rain too much.  I'll hopefully see Jazz this week. And I wanna go into town. I haven't been in for weeks.  Wellll I'd better go :P  seeya  Zen xxxx
