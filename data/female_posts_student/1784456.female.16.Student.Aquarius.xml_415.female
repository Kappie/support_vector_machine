My brother's been doing 'history GCSE corse work' so he's been on for a few days. :P So any way, hmm what happened, apart from me being a bit mad and exstatically happy! Oh, well guess I always am! Teee hoo haa haa! Sorry, just pure wow-i'm-on-blogger-ness! Uhuh... so any way, oh yeah Izzy's obsessed with Pete... ok so it might not be the whole truth but we like to bug her about it! (Sorry Izzy fans!) I had a funny day today, you know one where it dips and you feel sad then you go a bit mad. Oh, does any one else love that song that goes "I was walking along singing this song singing do wa didi didi dum didi dee!" Guess not... the singing lobster sings it! Ok, so now I sound wierder than normal! Eek getting thrown off, guess I'll write an interesting blog later!
