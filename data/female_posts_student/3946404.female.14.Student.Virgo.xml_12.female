Their all pretty cool, all of them. I love meeting new people, so it's all good. Remeber the whole Maya thing? Where me and her were walking around the neighborhood together?Now Cindy's mad at me and she can't even look at me without making a face. She thing is she went over to talk to Maya and was telling her all sorts of crud about this, I'd imagine. I actually can't really say that tho. I have no idea if it's true or not. I wouldn't doubt it tho. I was talking to Jojo and telling him how I didn't like being hated and he said "She's always mad at everyone. She's even mad at me right now." So I said "Why would she be mad at you? You didn't do anything". And he said "I dunno. She said just stay out of my way". I should've saved the convo, man. It was on AIM. He said he was used to it and I said that we shouldn't be. The line "She's mad at everyone." referring to Cindy, I've heard many times from MANY different people. Another one of my closer friends, Stephen has said she's not a real best friend, or even friend for that matter if she's like that. He wrote this to me in a note. {1.)Stephen- Guy from church. I've known him even longer than I've known Marissa. He's a PK(Preachers/Pastors Kid). He's one of my favorite people to hang around...I dunno if I'd tell him that tho..He's already big-headed enough... :P~~~) Other people have told me about the same thing. Different words, but the same thing. People did that same thing with Jojo and I tho, and me and him made it through it, so I figured that Cindy and I could too.....But it's really not seeming to work.Having a chick as a best friend...Really doesn't seem to work for me. They either get possessive....a jealous type, leave me for their boyfriend....every b/f they get, or they just get cruel. What the flip am I doing WRONG!?I get was too emo about this kinda stuff, cuz I always want to be cool with everyone. I don't want any enemies. I guess, sometimes I have to have them tho. When Marissa got to be a big problem..I got so mad..that I finally took it out on her. Big time. Then, while I was expecting the worst, she told me how proud she was that I'd finally stood up to her. But, we still weren't best friends, and things were odd for a while. But I'd stood up to her, just like Renee'd told me to. {2>)Renee'- The greatest kuzin a kuzin could have. 8 months older than me, I think. So, I'm STILL the jit kuzin, but she helps me to understand life. One of my Life Tutors. We fight like absolute crazy tho, sometimes. But, she's worth it. I love her.} About 2 years ago, I think. Renee'd come to visit us down here. Marissa was being crabby, (not the word I want to use, but, you get it) as usual and Renee just about slapped me because I did everything Marissa said. i was like her little slave. Seriously. She could've told me to jump off a cliff....no, I wouldn't quite do that but you get the point...Marissa and I had a sleepover just this week and we both had the time of our lives remembering old times. It was awesome. We'd admitted that we'd missed eachother like krazy. She is ONE of my best friends. I don't want to finalize anymore, no #1's on it. If there was a #1, it'd be Jojo, and he's a guy. Guys are cool. Girls aren't. Altho I am one...Some girls...grr, I hate some girls.. I dunno what's gonna happen today, it's only 10:30 in the morning. All heck could break loose, for all I know. Not expecting anything quite yet. WBL.
