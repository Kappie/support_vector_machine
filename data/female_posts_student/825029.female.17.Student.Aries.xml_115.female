If I wasn't at home doing something cool (which is never, there's nothing cool to do at my house), I was out with all the cool band people! Yeeeaaaaaaaa....anyways.....tuesday was my birthday, happy birthday me (finally old enough to be a junior, wtf).  Apparently Melissa got me something, she said she went to the mall, saw something that she just HAD to get, and she has the nerve to not tell me what it is or how much it cost, gah...and I have to wait aaaaaaaaall the way until Friday :(  Well I can't wait to see what it is...should be interesting.  Guess what sucks?  On the day after Thanksgiving, I get to be at work at 8 in the morning! Now I don't think it can get any better than that...oh wait...it can!  I have to be there until 2!  Well at least afterwards we're gonna hang out at like speed zone or whatever.  Also, if you guys wanted to do something on Saturday also, I work 11-3.  You guys should visit me more, that way I get more chances to tell you all off...bwa hahahaha.  omg I got a webcam, its pretty cool, although it doesn't take very good quality pictures, it gets the job done.  First picture I took was me flipping off the GameStop logo on my shirt...tells you how I feel about working :)  Anyways, not much else to say, so peace  [  urlLink behkkah  ] | [  urlLink czarels  ]  -Habibi has spoken
