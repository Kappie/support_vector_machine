So if you just want to do all that you did today over, come one over =). I hate cleaning but I'm kinda like you. I'll go like a week where I clean the whole house and it all started with cleaning out my desk. Maybe my mom is trying to get me to clean the whole house since we have company this weekend. *shrugs* who knows. Anyway I'm prolly going to renfest on monday but i'm going to be with jacob and them with becca. She's been feeling low so i want to cheer her up and I know how you all dislike her. Sorry guys....I'm not choosing her over you at all...i just can't stand her moping. I'm still you alls friend and any other day I would choose you all but becca is....worrying me. You know how brittany said that josh was in the hospital due to suicide...i'm thinking that depressed for becca.k b ye
