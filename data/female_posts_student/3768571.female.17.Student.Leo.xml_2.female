For anyone who doesn't know, txt is the language originating from mobile telephones, commonly used in IM (instant messaging) and E-mail. It's basically the act of abbreviating normal words into a scramble of jumbled letters that most youngsters can read better than regular English.   Just to give you a taster, here is an extract from Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream", translated into Txt:  "call u me fair? tha fair agen unsay. Demetrius luvs ur fair: o hpy fair! Ur i's r lode-*s; n ur tung's swet air More tunable, thn lark 2 sheprds eer, Wen weet is grn, wen hawthrn buds apeer. Siknes is catchin: O, wer faver, er I go; My eer shud catch ur voice, my i ur i, My tung shud catch ur tung's swet meldy. Wer da werl mine, Demetrius bein batd, Da rest id giv 2 b 2 u transltd. O, teech me ow u luk, n wid wat art U sway da moshun ov Demetrius's hart"  Now, I probably shouldn't have used Shakespeare as an example, seeming as he was practically in his own little world anyway, some of the stuff he wrote was just bonkers, but you see my point, no?   Ok, I confess to the occasional 'lol' (laugh out loud) or brb (be right back), but I would never lower myself to the extent of typing "imnsho" (in my not so humble opinion). Lol. Idiots.  We are a nation of changers. We make something, then we want to make it either bigger or smaller. Food we make bigger (unless you're a professional chef in which case the food gets smaller and the cost gets bigger) and appliances are getting smaller. I'm all for economising, really I am, but there should be a limit to how much we can minimise things before we cross the line from economical to just downright stupid.   Today's youth are tomorrow's future. If things keep going the way they are now we'll all be reading newspapers called things such as "Da Tymes" and "Da Dayly ExprS".  On the other hand, maybe it wouldn't be so bad... after all... "2 b or not 2 b, dat iz da qu." has quite a funny ring to it. And Shakespeare was a bit of a weirdo when it comes to language. Maybe the era of Txt will spawn a new race of superb playwrights? Well, either that or a race of idiotic super-morons.   Well, whatever the Children of the Revolution do, you can safely guarantee I'll be up there on the frontline - pioneering against it.
