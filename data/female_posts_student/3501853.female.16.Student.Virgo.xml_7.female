We went out for lunch, the food wasn't that great. After that, I went to work til 8:30. I don't feel good so I'm just watching movies with Tim now.  "I can't run anymore, I fall before you, Here I am, I have nothing left, Though I've tried to forget. Without you, I can't go on, Anymore, Ever again. I'm sorry, In all my bitterness, I ignored, All that's real and true, All I need is you, When night falls on me, I'll close my eyes, I can't lie anymore, I fall down before you, I'm sorry. The pain consuming me, But this time it's cut too deep, I'll never stray again."-evanescence siht rof dekcerw yats i-taking back sunday
