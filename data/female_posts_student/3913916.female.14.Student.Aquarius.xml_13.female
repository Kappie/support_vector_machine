That's why I'm also with that  pulling away  now, from my family. Our communication with each other is not open. We don't talk about things like school, or personal ones. I'm the one who's really moving away from them. I don't know why. I really can't explain it. I really don't like to go home everytime after school. I wanna stay with my friends and talk with them. It's easy to talk to them coz they know so many info about me. Is it bad that I do it? When I'm at home, I'm really not close with my brother. I ignore him most of the time. I move away and ignore him. My other brother, I don't ignore. He's close to me compared to my other brother. Sometimes I don't like him coz he always tells me to do this do that.... But it's OK. My dad, I don't like his jokes and name calling. That's why I hate it when he calls my friends some other name. My mom, she's ok. She's always there for me.  all of them are   If you ask me, friends or family, I pick  FRIENDS.  I'm really closer to them. They're like family to me already. That's why in our Reco, I really cried because I know I've done so many bad thigngs to my family.
