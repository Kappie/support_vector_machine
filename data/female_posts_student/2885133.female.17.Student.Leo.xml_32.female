Yep, I was whining, complaining, freaking out, annoying the hell out of the program coordinators, and wanting to kill fellow MUN people that were a bit slow in understanding messages.  From last Sunday until Saturday… The economics camp was disappointing as an academic camp. I learned absolutely nothing new about economics. It was the polar opposite for the leadership portion. Personally, I think I grew as a person due to the experience in having to be squished with the other campers in nearly all activities. Closeness (literally and figuratively speaking) definitely gave me a whole new outlook on life. Honestly, who would have thought I would be hugging people – more like clutching strangers for my life – after only a “hello”? I would suggest for all to go to the program, although please take note that the economics is at the most superficial level. Just for those wondering, the program is called Economics for Leaders of the Foundation for Teaching Economics. You can find more information about it at  urlLink http://www.fte.org/ .  Sunday… today Quite a lot of pictures taken with me whining about the car going so fast. Other notable events? Well, the Costco gas station closed 20 minutes before we got there. Exclamation of the day: Jeepers! Gas prices are at $2.35 per gallon of regular unleaded gas?!  Anyhoo, I mostly tried to perfect my photography skills… at least skills for photographing in a movie car. Below are some lovely pictures taken by yours truly.  *** I can't wait until I'm at Yosemite!!!!!!! Well, I am on the border. In the park would be great. I want to be hugging a tree! ***
