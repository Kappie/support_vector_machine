Just keep a firm grip of what you're handed with and be at peace with yourself, and simply figure it out. Slowly. There should be no hurry.   I met up with a fellow Live-Journal'er' today. She came down from Germany. She brought her boyfriend. She's from Sabah but she migrated to Germany 6 years ago. Her boyfriend's as german as they get, except he doesn't drink Beer. They don't know how to use the chopstick. They were such a sweet pair. They also think our malls are insanely humongos. I'll have to agree with them on that.   Our government tends to put all our money into shopping for some reason. Don't know what good that'd would do to the economy. We never really had smart people running the country anyways - this is all expected.   Ladies,  WE shouldn't complain about how expensive a Levi's jeans is here. When Elfie saw the Levi's here, she yelp joy praises.  "Only RM200," she chimes. She gets one on the spot.  "In Germany, it's almost 100 Euros a pair of Levi's jeans."   That's fucking 480 bucks per jeans!!!!!!!!!  For a pair of LEVI's!Well, shouldn't be a suprise since Aussie sells them for equally that amount or more. I don't know why I get this perception that things are somewhat cheaper where the currency is bigger. Except I have a feeling things are really much cheaper in the US of A. But that country fucking sucks. It has everything and anything I want. I'm in a current boycott against it. Fucking USA and all its privilleges.  The point is: 100Euro for a pair of jeans is insane. And 300+AUD for a pair of Von Dutch jeans is insane and 60Euro for a VonDutch trucker cap is suicidal. WHY ARE CLOTHES GETTING EXPENSIVE? CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EASE MY MIND AND TELL ME WHYYYYY?  Anyways, we took them to Ming Tien after that. We figured you cannot get any more Malaysian with the food cruisine then in Ming Tien. Honestly, I think Elfie and Flo were just plain scared of the place. I don't blame them. Our comrade, Mr. Aaron, was drunk next door. Quite a spectacle if you must know. He forgot Paul's name right after he said it less than 1/2 an hour ago. Alcohol has suchhhh an effect on people. It is another one of life's great mysteries.   Tomorrow, I'll have dinner with my cousin from Pakistan. I'll have to. The last time she came, I somehow managed to forget to meet up with her and received many threatening phone calls after that about the consequences of FFK-ing her. I'm pretty much threatened. I should go. She is family.  I hope they don't decide on clubbing or something.  Mom said I should just stay over with them; have a slumber party or something. I don't want to. I'll have the show the next day, the one in Jalan Ampang and then Paul's birthday dinner. Mom insisted.  I told dad they were going to take me clubbing. He phorbits the slumber party and will come get me, anyways - anyhow, from 1Utama to save me from the gastly sights of people dancing, getting high and very loud electronical idiotic-same-rhythm-unoriginal music.  I love my Dad.   I'll have to bleach my upper lip hair tomorrow as well. Oh the joy.
