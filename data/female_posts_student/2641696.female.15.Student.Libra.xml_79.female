Oh, the pain, the agony! She actually had the nerve to  call  me.  No one  calls me! I hate phones! I am anti-phone! I will probably go into a rant about that later, so hang tight.   JR is trying to get me to guess the size of his penis. Do I look like I care?? Loser! Loserloserloserloserloser! I hope he reads this and sees that I say he's a L O S E R !! ^^; (JR, don't kill me. Please.) ^^;;;;;;;   I sat with A and C at lunch today, which was cool, because I never sit with those guys any more. I miss you!! *hugs* You two should come sit with us, man, because we are totally cooler than D ^o^ hahahahaha sorry D Couldn't resist. (next year, girls, next year...)   So anyways. Just to clear things up: no, I don't   love   Frodo. I think he's cute and sweet and funny. Does that equal love? No! Of course not!! I am not the kind of person who goes throwing herself into passionate love affairs with people she doesn't even talk to!! I am not insane! I am normally challenged. Anyone who's in that madhouse conv. right now will realize I just copied myself. To get back to my point: No, I Do Not Mind If T Proposes to F. In fact I encourage her to ^^; It'd be great if the two of 'em got together; they're both cute people and it'd be very sweet. Plus, I'll just go back to PB, if I must. Cuz I still think he is the hottest frikkin guy in the school. heeheehee   Yes! Okay, this will be my Phone Rant. I dislike phones for many reasons. They make annoying sounds. They're confusing. They're loud and obnoxious and demand your attention. People usually are telemarketers or want help with homework. They tie up your hands, leaving you unable to do anything else. You can't listen to music while on the phone either, since you need to give the person on the line your undivided attention, which is just evil because I never have a fully focussed attention and when it's focussed it's very very short. I just ain't that kinda person. I need to MULTI-TASK, man. That's just the way it goes. Please, please, please don't take away that good ol' MSN!
