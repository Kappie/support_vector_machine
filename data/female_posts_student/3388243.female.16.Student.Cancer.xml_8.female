Everybody was rushing round trying to get people to sign anyting and everything. It was quite emotional and a few of us, including myself had tears in our eyes. I'm gonna miss a lot of people and the stuff people wrote in my leavers book was just sweet. I just wanna take this oppurtunity to Thank everyone in Park high that made the ordeal a lot easier! All my friends, you know who you are, I love you all sooooo much! We've all had our ups and we've all had our downs but by sticking together and being there for each other we've managed to get through them! Thank you soo much, everyone who's been there for me!!!!   Anyway, Thank you all and 'GOOD LUCK' for whatever the future brings!
