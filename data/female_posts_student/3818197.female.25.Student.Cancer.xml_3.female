I am writing while I'm still very upset over an email from a long time "friend" of my husband's who I inherited through him as well.  This "friend" of ours has been sending us over the summer series of emails on various topics including how Zack and mine married relationship sucks (this is possibly why we are so unhappy we've been together very happily for almost 9 years!), how we are shallow, unimotional and unspiritual people or how my husband is heavily influenced by me (which is funny considering that one of my biggest prides is that I rejoyce in the influence that my husband has in my life), and that this is why he will always fail at what he's [my husband] doing.  In the latest email he calls Zack's father and myself overbearing.  Zack's father doesn't even live in the same continent as us and this "friend" of ours hasn't seen him in the last 5 years or so. And yes, I can be overbearing, specially when I'm being told how to live and how to think and told even how to cook in my own house by someone who has no right to do so.  I can get overbearing and defensive just as anybody else would under those circumstances. He suggests that Zack needs to get away from us and leave with him and go to the mountains just like they used to.  I detect a bit of insanity here.  Most people don't understand the meaning of growing up and growing appart.  I think it has happened to all of us that while in this transition of 'growing up' (if there's such a thing) we loose people that we considered to be the greatest of friends.  I lost several "best friends" from high school just because we didn't see each other eye to eye in many, many issues, but we didn't send each other nasty emails, we didn't even get mad.  We simply acknowledged the fact that our lifes had become very different and moved on.  I still keep in touch with the majority of them, but no longer at a deep level like we used to.  And that is perfectly ok.  I feel angry, frustrated and very dissapointed with this person.  I can't speak on behalf of my husband, but I know he's at the end of his rope too.  We have choosen to not even respond to our "friend's" allegations because every time we see his name on our email all we can do is hold on tight as we read the series of negative, borderline insanely hurtful comments that follow, and the worst part is that, no matter how hard I've tried to look at this 'negative reinforcement' under a positive light, I can't find reasons to justify continuing a friendship with someone who uses you (us) as his scapegoat for all his frustrations, failures and sources of anger.  The part that always gets me is how the emails end in a: You guys know I love you like family...
