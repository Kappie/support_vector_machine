Fairytales Tell Tales   lets pretend were not needy lets pretend our hearts still beat lets pretend we fall in love tonight clumsy enough to fall for anything well stumble on our words well spill our guts on creaking bar stools below the neon blue low lives hiding in dives theres no feeling in drinking sleeping with strangers ghosts passing through bedrooms unaware a faint reflection on the barbacks mirror a face i never knew whispering, please dont be a stranger to me. who are you if youre alone' youre no good at pretending all my plays have tragic endings you wish i was a fairy tale this frog will never change anything just pretend that youre in love that scolding sun is bound to come up eventually so who is it that whispers in your ear a haunting voice blows in through the window theres no feeling floating over beds a needy pleading apparition crying 'who am i if im alone? i hardly exist at all. lets pretend that we dont need anything anymore from anyone. i dont want to feel anything anymore lets just pretend' well live happily ever after
