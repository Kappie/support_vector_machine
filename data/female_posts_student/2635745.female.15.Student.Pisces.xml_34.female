We have our music and learned from now on we are practicing on the stage!  How exciting!!  And....that Friday on the 26th we get to miss the whole day of school!!!!!!!!!  I am super psyched.  We will be practicing at Elisa's that morning and compete at around 1:00 at Ravenwood.  Whoo Hoo!!  As you can see I am super super excited (doesn't that sound like an Elle Woods line).  Ha! I crack myself up with my exclamation point rampage!  And I going out tonight to get my hoodie.  I am a blessed person!  Well enough for now!  If you read comment, Pleeeease!  P.S.  Becca you should really start your own blog.  Since I have refused to read Jenessa's and Liz's I only have Erica's to read.
