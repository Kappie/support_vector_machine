A place for me to blab/complain/moan about my very pathetic life in the east cost.  For those of you who are being considered as my close friends -- congratulations!  You no longer need to hear my complains 24/7.  I will just blab it out here, and you can check it out at you own time, at your own convenience.  For those of you who are equally important but who I did not have time to social with during busy school time -- good news!  If you are really that curious/bored/have nothing else better to do with your own life, look over here.  You can get constantly updated news about me, about east cost, and about how much it sucks over here (refering to the weather, the school, my tiny little room which can never get heated enough, and my tiny little kitchen which runs out of counter space with just one microwave and one rice cooker ... yeah you get the picture).
