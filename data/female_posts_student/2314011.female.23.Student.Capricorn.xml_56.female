As if I don't have anything better to do.  Told him I had this blog entry cooking up all day, but he didn't even take a breath as he spoke right over the top of me.  Good thing he fucks like a banshee, or I'd never forgive him.  So I completely underestimated the outline for the Motion to Suppress Evidence assignment.  Left school around 3 with the best of intentions to work diligently as soon I returned home until it was completed.  Then I would have all evening to write a long, lazy, juicy blog and maybe even start a new book.  Instead, my futon sucked me into its void and there I remained until 430.  Stupid Dr. Phil.  Arranging the work space, surrounding my desk with proper authority, choosing the perfect background music, etc. took another 15 minutes.  Here's where the underestimation comes in:  I let myself watch TV for so long thinking the assignment wouldn't take very long; once I got started on it.  Knew precisely what I was going to say.  The damn thing was practically written in the cases waiting in my backpack.  All I had to do was patch them together in outline form.  Shouldn't take more than 2 hours.    There's a moment at the beginning of each and every writing enterprise that bears a striking resemblance to the end of each and every research session.  The moment where everything in front of you is nothing you can use.  All of it made sense half an hour ago.  But now that it's time to do something, it may as well be written in Greek.  So the blank page stared at me for more than a few minutes, taunting.    "Uh huh, that's right!"  It said, hand on hip.  "Glad you watched that last case on Judge Judy NOW, aren't you?"  But those moments are always defeated.  The outline's a glorious 4 pages and it only took an hour more than my estimation.  Which leaves me a bit less time than I hoped to devote to my blog, but we'll make do.  My friends' reactions to the blog (and the content included therein) have been interesting.  The new ones probably just take it all in stride, as part of who I am.  The older ones, though, have been more than a bit surprised.  How could someone who kept much of herself private, hidden from casual conversation, suddenly be this revealing?  Their surprise is a good thing, I think (hope); but it raises a valid question.  And I'm not sure I have an adequate answer, other than to say I was ready.    I'm reminded of a conversation with my boss at my high school job.    "I can read people very easily.  It's fun to freak them out with my observations; some of them are like books."  "What do you read from me?"  I asked, trying not to sound as curious as I was.  "I can't."  "What do you mean?"  He was one of the few people I spent most of my time with at work, after all; he HAD to have some kind of read on me!  "You're impossible to read.  Very protective of yourself, don't let much emotion through."  "Really?" I replied, trying to figure out how I could have been so obvious.  "But I think I have it narrowed down to a couple of explanations why.  You're either hiding something, or you've been hurt in the past.  And you don't seem to be the type who would have something to hide."  As it turns out, he was right on both counts.    A big part of what I was hiding has been recounted here.  Mostly because I was ready to tell it.  The last year has been a study in being open and receiving, letting go of control and needing to know, beginning to see the person I've always wanted to be.  And this has been an excellent tool in that undertaking.    Remember the day I was sure the letter in the mailbox was the rejection from the law school because it was too small to be acceptance materials.  I looked, saw, closed the mailbox without taking it out and went to class.  The walk was pretty transcendental, I have to say.  The significance of the fact that it was the way to my Creative Nonfiction writing class wasn't lost on me.  Walking back, I promised myself I would stop resisting the part of me who is a writer.  Up until then, I'd put the choice out to the universe: law or writing.  "You tell me what I should do, cosmos, the decision has tortured me long enough!"  That day it seemed I had my answer.  Soon realized the letter was the wait-list notification.  Three months, a round of personal growth and daily appointments with a notebook and pen later, I had both and was on my way to adventures undreamed.    And I'm still loving the ride.  So my little bloggy was really just another step in that process of exploring, growing, learning.  Don't think I kept this stuff from you, friends, and, in turn, had no problem writing about it for all to read.  I finally am ready to share more of myself with you and am able to here, in my favorite passion.
