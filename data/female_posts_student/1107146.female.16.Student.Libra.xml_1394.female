I got all the History, Theory, and Acompanying lessons covered but my private lessons are only half covered 30min,....*whine* and that's the 2nd level, the 1st level would have gotten 45 min covered so the full scholarship 1st level still wouldn't have covered everything..why do I feel like killing the wording of full scholarship. Anyway this was a huge dissapointment so...no one talk about piano awhile. on the good note there were only 11 scholarships for all levels and I got 2nd...that's ok but still I should have gotten 1st..i should have practiced more....linds we should talk considering you're hte only one that cares about piano
