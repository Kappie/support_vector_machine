I'm calling SH tomorrow. I'm still really upset about the whole thing. This is just ridiculous. RB thinks I should wait until after the finals so I can talk to him about the whole season and not just one game. They're so young. MI thinks I should go over and talk to him today, before work of course. I don't think I can do it face to face, I'll lose it. This is ridiculous. Why am I letting myself get this bothered? It really does bother me. So young. I'm not calling SH before work, that's not  a good idea. My head needs to be at work when I'm at work. Call tomorrow. But what good will it do? Maybe I should talk to Buck. He'd understand more than Horn would, Buck knows me better. I don't know. I have to talk to Horn at one time or another, Buck will tell Horn anyways, so I may as well talk to Horn. Would Buck take it sesriosly? They're so young. I don't know what to do.
