While trying to put a little tube thingy into this spray can of compressed air, I leaned it against myself to get leverage.  Wouldnt you know it?  I now have a nice dark circle from the bottom of the can that didnt come off my shirt with rubbing.  Luckily I had a sweater.  It was 9:15am.  At 12:15pm, I got hit by an old lady (she  HAD  to be no younger than 80) while getting out of the parking lot after picking up my lunch.  The car was perfectly perpendicular to hers as she started pulling out.  So basically, no, I was NOT in her blind spot.  Of course she was wearing those big dark sunglasses that they give out when you have eye surgery, so perhaps EVERYTHING is in her blind spot.  Thank god Saturns are made out of some alloy that has flexibility to it because she didnt put a scratch on the car.  Scared the shit outta me though!!!  I was all honking and screaming, "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOOOOIIIINNNG!?!?!"  Then I realized she was ancient and let up.  Looked at the car, saw no damage and told her it was okay.  She looked totally lost.  She should not be driving alone.  And now, well now I'm dealing with my best friend's issues.  She is honestly the worst person for me to try and talk to when I'm cranky like this, because I'm not very helpful... I'm sorry, call me a bad person, but I just cant deal right now.  SIGH.
