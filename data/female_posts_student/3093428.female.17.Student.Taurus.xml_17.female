All ROIGHT!) but Literature provincial is Thursday.  HELP!  Ippany-Steph and I must combine our superpower efforts to pass the Lit provincial! Hey, now that isn't such a bad idea...    IPPANYSPAM: The Industrial-Teen Revolution! Coming to comic book stores near you. Or near me. Hopefully near me so I don't have to bus.   Anyway, back on topic. Well, not the same topic. The Wicked Orange had quite the incredible band practice yesterday, and we started a new song (it's metal and it's either going to be about emo and fire, or killer robots [that invade the Whitehouse...ahaha! Jamie will kill me]). But anyway, I'm looking forward to my first time playing a show since last summer! It's gonna be awesome! Hey, might as well take the time to advertise.   The Wicked Orange! And 17 other awesome bands! Going all out, head to head, LAST BAND STANDING! Sunday! Sunday, SUNDAY, SUNDAY!! (funday?) June 27th at the Mesa Luna on West Broadway 5:00 pm - 12:30 am! Tickets are $10 online or from ME, or $15 at the door. Info and list of bands at  urlLink Supernova.com .      Whew. That was some hardcore advertising. Enjoy. I expect to see you all there.   By the way, I was looking at all of your  lovely  profiles when I found THIS on randomandrew's:  "You're going to the moon! What did you forget to pack?  stupid thing tells me i can only have 150 chars. how jewish. "    I'M  Jewish, nitwit. Does that mean I can only have 150 characters, as well, Mister Bond? Whatever  do   you mean, ANDREW? That's all I have to say.
