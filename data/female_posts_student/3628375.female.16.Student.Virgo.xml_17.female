I still have to finish reading "A Tale of Two Cities" and lets just say, I'm not far at all...and its due the 1st day!!! (YIKES!!!) Well I'm going to get my license next week so that a plus. I'm excited, and supposably my dad is giving me the van to drive. I'm going to feel so ghetto driving to high school in a van, but oh well!!!!! hehe. I'm kinda excitied about going back to school and getting back into a schedule, and seeing everyone. High School is almost over and its kinda sad...:( These last 2 years are going to go by so fast, its freaky!!! I need to start preparing myself. But on to other news. I might go see Missy's dad tomorrow. I'm kinda scared, but I know I need to see him. That man is like a father to me, and I can't believe that he really had a stroke. Life is so unfair! But atleast he's alive. I praise God for that!!!! It's just a reality check because things are totally going to change now. Missy told me today, he was getting a hole in his throat like people get when they have emphysema, so he can breathe, eat and talk. And he's going to be in the hospital for 4-6 more months!!!!!!!!! But I gotta go. Later babes!!!!!! ~*CaSeY*~
