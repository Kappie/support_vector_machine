Prissy stuck up little girls running around with everything hangin out, tryin to get a complete stranger to fall in love with them. i mean, HELLO!! just stop looking so much, i mean for all they know "the one" might be right under their stuck up little noses. Ugh, then they cry like they really loved him. Maybe they did, but its just hard to believe! Once again i'm done! Sorry, for all the complaining.       Out like a fat kid in dodge ball!
