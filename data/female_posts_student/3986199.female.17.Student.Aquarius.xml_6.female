I left and went to go and see about getting some sleep around 1. Of course, people felt the need to come downstairs and wake me up around 3 because the power went out and they couldn't get back on my computer. You know, there is a reason for me having it password protected and all, so don't even start with me on how important it is you get back on my computer. If I'm asleep, damnit leave me like that. Don't be going and waking me up just so that way you can get back on to talk to your girlfriend. You could always go home and just talk to her at your house. But no, of course you're here and always arguing with me about MY COMPUTER. Don't go telling me what I can and can't do on my own computer. Go home and mess with yours, my computer is my computer. You can't keep me from going and wanting to shut it down, or wanting to stop some programs just cause they're making the computer slow as hell. Just cause you want the program running doesn't mean that I do, so when I say it gets shut off, shut it off, don't argue with how important it is. I want it off. Deal with it. Some people.
