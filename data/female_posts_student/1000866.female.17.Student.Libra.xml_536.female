Then, tonight Katharine and Brandon saved me from my house. They just called me while they were out in my driveway. It was tr√®s funny.   Hmmm, I know information about something, but I don't know whether to tell the person or not. I don't want to hurt him. He's a good friend, but I feel as if I should tell him so he knows. Oh, I don't know. I'll see.   Tonight, Brandon, Katharine, and I all went to Walgreens. Haha, how DO those pregnency test things work? But yeah, then we went to Best Buy and Katharine and I were hanging out in the desk chairs. Fun times. We talked about stuff. Mostly about Chris. Well, I talked to her about Chris. I think I just really need to talk to him. I was so upset with him for a while there but now people seem to be saying he's genuinely worried about our friendship. That kind of surprises me. It also makes me wonder if maybe he was just going through a phase. I don't know, I kind of realized how much I miss him. Although I was really upset with him for a while. I don't know. I guess I'll wait and see if he calls or something. I can't just call and be like, "Chris, I'm upset with you." Somehow, that doesn't seem right. I would have told him I was upset with him from the beginning, but then we just didn't talk for a few days and then a few days turned into like...two weeks. Oh, I don't know. :( I just know even if I am upset with him, it's really upsetting not having him to talk to.
