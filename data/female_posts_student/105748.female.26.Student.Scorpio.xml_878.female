Y'know, Ching, I don't mind updating my defs - usually do it right at the end of my session, so I'm risking a little, but I've been virus-free for 2 years now (knock on formica)!  BTW, it appears the Egg and I was the prototype for Green Acres.  A brilliant show.  Saw Lord of the Rings and the new Star Trek.  Both pretty good.    I'm going to go play with my slide rule now...
