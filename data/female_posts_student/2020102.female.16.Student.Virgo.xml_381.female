It starts with the most recent and works it's way back to freshman year. Nothing interesting happened to me in middle school even though I still kept a journal then.   "I think oysters smell so disgusting. I don't know what made me think of this but sometimes my parents buy the kind in cans and they eat it in the kitchen and it stinks up the entire house. It's so gross. And they look completely unappealing, like dead, fat slugs."  "I was talking to Austin online last night and he goes 'my dad is reading everything I reight.' I have never seen that word spelled in such a messed up way."  "I have nothing to write about. Maybe I could start ranting about how Erin and Melanie were getting on me because I stacked an extra chair at lunch. Me: Erin, stack your chair! Erin: No, I'm being a rebel. Melanie: Don't give in to the dark side! Erin: I'm not going to give in to peer pressure. (I try to stack her chair, Erin tries to stop me) Erin: What are you doing? WHY ARE YOU STACKING IT! Me: They said to stack chairs. Erin: Do you always do what you're told? Me: Yes. Erin: If they told you to jump off a cliff would you do it? Me: Only if all my friends were doing it. (Erin and Melanie laugh hysterically) Melanie: You get 10 points for that one, Sarah. That's so awesome, I'm going to use that sometime. Anyway, I was really annoyed by that. Why shouldn't I stack a chair? What harm is it doing anyone? If you're going to be a 'rebel' then do it so what you're 'standing for' is something important and makes a difference. Not 'oh, I'm feeling rebellious. I'm not going to stack my chair.' That's not helping anyone. Rebellion should be started because you don't believe the way things are going is the right way. Not because you're lazy and don't want to stack a flipping chair. I don't do everything I'm told. I do what God says to do. God says to serve others. Therefore, I will stack my chair, and Erin's, and Melanie's, and Ryan's if I have to."  "Jeremy keeps saying 'fifthed' while he's trying to say a number to the fifth power. I think there is something seriously wrong with the people in this class."  "I definitely just failed that math test. I hate my life. I really do. Well, at least my journal is cool looking."  (this was around Valentine's Day) "Before class, I was standing there with Erin looking at the senior project posters and this girl came up and tapped me on the shoulder. 'Here,' she said, handing me 4 Hershey kisses. 'You get two extra because you're wearing a Forsberg jersey. He rocks.' She gave two to Erin. It made my day."  "Okay, I  can  tolerate 15 more minutes of this class. I  can . I  refuse  to go insane. I will  not  stab this pen in my eye."  "I am going to get the flu. I know it. I can feel the germs infecting me."  "I am ignoring Brandon today. The desk across from me is vacant. There is no annoying jerk there throwing his pencil at the ceiling."  "My mom hates it when I drive. She's always like 'SLOW DOWN! YOU'RE NOT STOPPING FAST ENOUGH!' Does she really think I'm stupid enough to not stop before I hit the car in front of me?"  "I hate algebra, I hate slope and y intercept, I hate variables, I hate graphing crappy lines, I never want to do this again."  (during small groups freshman year) "Kristin: Are we being loud?  Shane: Just a little. Kristin: Yeah well, at least we aren't putting bagels in our pants. Shane: Yeah, well at least we ate those bagels. Kristin: Are you kidding me? Shane: It was part of the game!"  Here is something else that happened on Take 5 that I wrote down but then I completely forgot about until I read about it just now: Q: What do you think about Canada? Shane: Um... it's above us? I don't know, I don't really care. Q: What is your favorite French cuisine? Shane: Probably salt.
