Er I'm working today 1.30 to 5.30 and all day tomorrow and probably all day both days at the weekend but I am kinda ill and may have to ring in sick... :( No really all coughy and whatnot. Its not pleasant.  Um Thursday I'm going theatre with Paul to see Journeys End, Friday Jenna and I are doing our Eng presentation in London. Weekend working. Next week I believe there is ice skating on either Tuseday or Wednesday, must dicuss that with Doe and our results on Thursday. Great. Jackie are you away for the results?
