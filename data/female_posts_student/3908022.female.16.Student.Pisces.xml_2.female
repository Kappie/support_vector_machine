I can only imagine what I'll feel like the day before I start my new school. I want people to like me. I want to do a good job. I want to deserve the payment that I'll get. (No matter how small the amount of money is.) I need help, I think. I keep thinking that everything I heard at the introduction day just went in one ear and out the other. I feel like I've forgotten the most basic things. And I don't know how to make porridge! That's minus points, right there. And I especially don't know how to make it at 7.30 am!! I'm a walking dead at 7.30! How can anyone focus on anything that early in the morning. I'm so scared.
