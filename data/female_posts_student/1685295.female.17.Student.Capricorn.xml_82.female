Just wanted to pop by and say Happy Independence Day to all (I've said that about thrice already). This was the first year I think that I didn't go to the parade, since no one could come with me. Going to a parade is not something you do alone, you always need someone to share the love with and there was no one this time, so I didn't go.    translation: Our India is the best in the World
