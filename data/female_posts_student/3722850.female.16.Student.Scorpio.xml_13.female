They bought me a new tinkerbell journal with satin lace as a lock, emm a pink kitty bling bling necklace. a packet of stationary/ notebook paper with a farie design and a folder with tinkerbell on it, it was like old skool though with a spray paint effect. as i said i enjoyed it, it cheered me up but i still don't feel all that well. i'm grateful to have parents that care like that i know, even thought i call them losers and stuff. lol         : ) i love yellow card, heh just had to say that, i always have, even after all this bs about fame. i knew they were gonna be big one day. . .           i talked to nick on sunday and em i don't know wheather i should be mad or confused or whatever, as a matter of fact i shouldn't be anything, its not like we're going out, but i asked why he seems so disclosed off and such, i mean at first i started to understand but then he just basically gave me an excuse that eaither anyone can use or he really ment it, and i think he ment it. i just can't figure why i'm the one feeling like a loser at the end , when he phrases that telling ppl how u are is a foolish thing to act apon. any how it made me think, and i myself have always been an open person , but not retartedly open where i'm spilling about my whole life. lol believe, believe ppls there are ppl like that, it happends to me all the time, and i don't know why. but in a way i sense this thing he has as being selfish, and if he's not willing to open himself a bit up more for me then i can't possibly understand how he can go and tell me he has feelings for me and he cares and stuff.   In all actuallity it adds up to nothing, i've known him for quite sometime and it seems he's closer to his other online buddies then to me, and i'e been there, i've never been a problem yet it would be a foolish thing to open up to me, and as a matter of fact our conversations have been a rather bit dull since the whole confession thing.        This has taught me to keep my mouth shut and go on with life. that right there has added another reason to quit the whole online thing. i've already told him that but this ones another reason.           I hate ppl who think the only way to reach someone to talk is the internet, that fucked up bullshit and i will not stand for that.    in total i must have about 8 friends on all messengers *i.e  yahoo,aim,aol    and eaither they are all the same pple on each messenger and i know them in person, sooo whats the problem?                                                     Laterz P.s  Erica is the best and she knows it, shes having a hard time, and i'm there
