And if you have toilet-slash-plumbing issues or a stalker outside that you want to like, go away, dial 0 and tell the operator. Yes, they really told us to let you know what to do if a strange man was outside your door. Kris: Mark and I don't count as strange men, either. Hilary: How does a strange man outside your door not constitute as an emergency? Mark: Uh... he's not breaking in, he's just standing there.  "We have a 6 month year old daughter who was born... approximately six months ago." -James Grout, speaker  (the projector isn't working properly) James: So... what's going on with the projector? Z-Man: It's still warming. Dara: It says change the lamp. Maybe you should do that. Kris: Yeah! Maybe we should. Do you have.... five hundred dollars to pay for one?  "It's one of the rules of being from Canada. You have to listen to the band Rush, drink or at least know about beer, and eat bacon. If you can do that you're a Canadian." -James  "I was asking a man named Jesus that I couldn't even see into my heart. I had seen pictures of him, he had a really nice beard and... blue eyes, oddly enough for a Jewish man..." -James  Matt: Who made this big mess in the hall? You? Sarah: No, it's such a mess because the guys came and screwed it all up. Matt: Pshh... always blame it on the guys. Sarah: Well it's true. Matt: Yeah probably.  "Austin is a sexy beast!" -Sara, screaming at Austin when we were on the swings and he was walking back to the lodge  "My name's Audra and I have a really cool little sister named Ashley who never copied me in anything, ever, and I looked up to her even though she was younger and shorter than me. So let's fast forward a couple years to when I was dating this boy named Kris Pagard... he was the only boy I could find who would laugh at my dad's jokes." -Ashley telling her sister Audra's "life story"  "Avoid crime as a career." -James to Mark when he found Mark's sweatshirt in his room after Mark was trying to play a prank on him  "I really wanted a melon baller, you know, one of those things where you can make perfectly round little balls of melon. Can life get better? I submit that it cannot." -James  "If it's in here... it's the truth." -James reading out of the tabloid Weekly World News  "My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard... and don't you forget it." -Austin  (Sara and Sarah are praying in the hallway during devos and Matt and Jason walk through) Matt: Sorry. (steps between us) Sara: Geez... (sarcastically) Matt: Sorry! I'm sorry! Sara: I'm so disappointed. Jason: (points at previously unseen box of cupcakes he's holding) I know, I should have more.  "Like a rock... nothing ever got to me... like a rock... ohhh Matt's like a rock!" -Matt  Ashley: (ending her prayer) Talk to you later! Bye! Matt: How's he leaving? "See you later, God!"
