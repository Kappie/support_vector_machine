Here's a quote of mine:  Phileda: well then tell him to get off his fucking pedestal over the rest of the world and be your boyfriend! you shouldn't have to hang on to him while he's scared you're gonna leave.   OK, I was at the Pleasanton Wal-Mart today and I was looking at the CDs and this dude comes up and asks me if I need anything. I was like, "No I'm fine." So then I was browsing and he comes up besides me and starts putting CDs away. He stayed there for a while, and I was like, Oh wait!!!!! He likes me lol. So I asked him if Wal-Mart had a karaoke section. He goes, "Oh yah, a big one. In fact we need to get rid of some of the CDs." So I go over there, and he asks me if I am looking for something in particular. So I said that I was looking for a CD to sing to for a school assignment. He said, "Oh, high school or college?" (OK: he thought I might have been in COLLEGE? lol) I was like, high school. And then, he goes: "Oh." And walks away. and then he says "You didn't look like you were in high school." I was like, Oooo my frickin god, I'm a freshman in high school, you're some Coastal Bend affiliate who reminds me of a bisexual person but you're still hot lol, and my mom is coming over here to get me. So yah, that was interesting don't you think?   Anywayz. Tomorrow we're marching in band. *sigh* HEy, I can play the fight song, finally! lol  Love you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Kiss my ass you haters (lol i'm sorry i don't know where that came from) Love Me As I Hate you! lol. Hey I luv u all,  Philly Dilly Willy Silly Phileda. God that was gay.  -Phileda
