Erica and i were leaving so she could run to her house and get some medicine and there were 4 old ladies outside the gate wearing survivior sashes adn they were smokeing. it was terrible.adn i had started to wonder what the point was. I could see if someone was paying so much for ever mile or something like that but we were all walking for no reason. Also they were haveing a blood drive which i thoutt was kinda commical because usually when you donate blood thay have you wait a while or you have soemone with you to drive you home becaude some people get all dizzy. at least that is what i thought could easily be wrong since i haveent been to one. But were all walking and they would draw blood and o could just see a whole bunch of ppl passing out on the track after it nad then haveing to go to the hospital and then they get blood maybee and altought its not th e same blood it would still hve made it pointless. Oh i feel so bad for michael.they lost what would have been the 2nd to last game they would paly by one point in overtime from what i hear they were doing verry poorly at the beginning and in the last 10 min. started playing like themselves. but he still has 2 years to go to state, that is his goal. i think thast there is a ring they get once they go that he wants because he was talking once and was all the only ring i am ever going to wear i sth e on e i get hwen we win state....... ok sleep is sounding good now later
