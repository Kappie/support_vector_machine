"  my results from "The Multiphasic Personality Inventory" test lol i dont even know what that means but.. eek  also disturbing is my new quasi-hick persona.  AAAAAAAAAAGh  Over break I: Sat through two hours of Deadwood Went to see the Alamo w/ the asian posse Watched Nashville Star Raided my brother's MP3s and listened to sappy country love songs for 3 hrs+ Watched CMT  Okay so maybe it was because I was really bored and watched a lot of TV... but.... I dunno  Be afraid.  What should I do to my hair?
