Its funny to me in a way how everyday I thrive off coming to this very same computer desk just to write down what Im thinking. Its weird how to me in a way its like a journal except everyone gets to read it, which is weird because I cant stand when people read what I write down...I dont know why I do...maybe because in some since its attention. Funny...I try to hide myself but yet seek attention...I never really understood why I always wanted what I didnt or couldnt have.
