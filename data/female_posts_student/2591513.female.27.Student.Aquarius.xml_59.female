I was happy yesterday, my other best friend, one of my oldest friends next to Ed and Tim...Keiko e-mailed me.  Unfortunately her car got broken into.  She has been having one helluva time as well.  I am glad to hear that she has found some happiness again.  I hope this time it works out for her.   I miss my friends.  I wish I lived closer to all of them, some days I feel so isolated, especially these past few weeks....when life seems to be so complicated.  It would be nice to be able to go out for one hour with a friend and forget about the problems that plague me.  Good night to the 3 of you who read this, I hope you all enjoyed the beautiful day.
