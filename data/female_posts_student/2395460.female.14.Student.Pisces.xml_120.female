Alessi has designed a sleek thermoplastic and sterling silver alternative, the  urlLink Tag Along Bracelet . Unlike those flimsy hemp bracelets, the Tag Along is built to last so you make your wish when you put it on and keep it on until your wish comes true. Consider it a renewable source of good luck and move it to the other wrist next time something or someone catches your fancy. $28, in black or white.
