Say it to me face!" and lots of of "Alright, bitch" And "F You's" but that F is extended, of course. And then there's Barbara, and she just sits there with her ugly pink stripe shirt and her too tight skirt day after day and waves her fists around and thinks that she is mad. It is sooo comical. Tomorrow, Sar and I may start to sway and sing "Why Can't We Be Friends, Why Can't We Be Friends" and let the wonderful-ish glow of her cel phone take over. YES. Oh how I own't miss you my, Driver's Ed buddies.
