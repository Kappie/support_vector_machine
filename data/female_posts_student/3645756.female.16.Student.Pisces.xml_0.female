I had a crush on him when i was in the 3rd grade, he was in the 6th so i never thought id get to date him.  then in 8th grade i met him again, we dated for about 2 months, and broke up.  after a year which really seemed like forever without him, we got back together and we've been together ever since, and i dont plan on that changing! :-D He listens to me complain (all the time), and he even lets me cry infront of him.  He puts up with me a lot, because im very annoying, but he loves me anyhow, i could not ask for more.  ive never been in a relationship this great....we dont fight a lot, altho when we do i cry because i hate fighting with him, and we're not exactly picky about what we're going to do when we're together.  Apparently God was very happy with me the day he sent Ben my way, because I'm guessing he was my reward...he he...what a prize!!!  this is the perfect love!!!
