Sometimes, the choice, just can't be chosen. You have no choice to pick the correct choice.... Friendship is worth keeping. Definitely. Never, EVER, give up friendship For that'd be wat keeps you going in times of trouble. Of cos not forgetting my dear prince, Jesus Christ.  Thank you Lord for showing me your grace over the past week. I wouldn't have survived if not for your strength and grace. As You said in the holy bible, You will strengthen me as I stand upon Your Word. I don't feel that I'm totally ok now.That I am total independent of him but at least I must say its much better than two weeks ago.  He's back. And he called. He said he smashed his phone after talking to me two saturdays ago. What is this? Another lie?   You are a scary person. Too unpredictable.  Too smart that I can't tell when ur lying and when ur not.  You say you really did miss me when you were in London.  That you tried calling me thru public phones but couldn't get thru. That's what ur best at. Isn't it? Blaming the telecomms company.  Remember how you used to teach me this trick? Yuo couldn't even tell me you'd miss me when I asked you b4 you left. Now ur back. You wana meet me. To pass me the stuff you bought for me like what you claimed. You want to talk to me. Finally you want to. To get it over and done with. You didn't want to talk about us before you left for London. Remember?  And I let you go without forcing you to talk. Now I don't wana see you.  For seeing you is gona upset my whole biological system.  I spent an entire week trying to get you outta my system, my life. I prayed. I prayed really hard. And when I didn't hear from you for a week, I tot to myself. Thats it. God has showed me the way.   And now ur back telling me your granddad has jus passed away.  I'm sorry about what happened to your granddad. I wana be there for you as a fren but I can't bear seeing you. My emotional baggage is simply too heavy.  Seeing you would be like unearthing all the memories I've been trying so hard to bury.  I hate to see you leave. Your back facing me, you heading down that corridor towards the lift. I hate the end of our conversations. To have to hang up after we talk. I'm glad you wana be frens with me. But you know it. I can't. At this moment, I can't only be frens with you.   hey can someone just teach me how to post those darn pictures into this blog please.  its getting on my nerves. haha. and yea how do I send sms online? haha..
