In addition to this, Ton, Jer, Jas and I went to the zoo... yay.. bleh.. it was fun but my joints hurt (yes, I'm getting old).. we Metro Surfed (standing up on the MetroLink instead of sitting down and not holding on to anything- good times), got quartz crystals that would have cost us a bloody fortune elsewhere, meandered around the bird house (found a really cool bird- the Superb Starling- shockingly blue with a red chest and brilliant yellow eyes.. he kept chirping at me and hopping up to my side of the cage when I'd whistle at him... hehe.. he's a cutie.. lol.. what? I love birds..) and then crashed on the Metro on the way home... at home I tried some sushi *an aquired taste to find out.. I can only stand so much before the seaweed gets to me.. bleh*  and now I'm sitting here waiting for 11 ish to roll around so I can talk to Mr. J... (we talked today about our relationship- which caused him to cry.. I hate it when I do that.. makes me want to cry.. I feel like such a rat.. ee.. sucks bigtime- so I hope to be able to cuddle with him to make up for it.. ) ((sighs)) sorry about the disjointedness of this post.. I'm tired and want to go back to my book   The Kite Rider .. it's interesting..  Down Blanket Wishes and Cappuchino Dreams, ~Megs
