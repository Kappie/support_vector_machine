And if it isn't, now it is, officially certified by me, at least on this BLog, and here, I have the absolute authority as such. So hereby,  smartness is now an official word and shall be used as much as possible. thank you for your time, please go and enjoy the smartness of the rest of your day   Heh. I'm a retard. I'm also caffeinated, and tired, and hungry, which would make me a caffetirehungretard. That's a word now, too, but nobody has to use it. I just sort of made it up because I was being retarded. And I really am trying to live up to my word potential.  Oh man, I just got struck with some EMO, I really wanted someone here a second ago. Mmh. Let me tell you about this person.  Did you ever know anyone that just defined the better parts of you by being themselves? I know someone like that. This person is like the best thing you've ever tasted and you can't get enough of...maybe a more abstract example, but it's like having a really bad itch, then scratching it: there's some really massive relief after the fact, this person is like that relief. A feeling of comfort, a constant source of joy and appreciation, a friend without limits to the bitter end and beyond, in the way that you'd really like to tell people about but you just can't describe, someone who you'd call on for anything because they'd call on you for all the same reasons. Someone who knows how you bleed and shares in it somehow everytime you do, not just sitting there and telling you to let it slide, that life's tough, whatever. It's a person that could say all the same right things anyone else could say, and yet, the way this person says them, they're just that much better. It's a person you would be happy to stand up and defend if all the world would fall on you if you did, the kind you would take a bullet for, an army's load of bullets if it came down to it, it's someone that would and has held my hand through everything that's happened for years now, that gave me a reason and a want to understand, that made me believe that I am something to someone, that still inspires me to remember the beautiful things in life, to remember that there is still love even when the world seems filled with black, that can pull me from the clutches of my very own ever-fucking prison if only for a while and remind me that they're still here, they're standing at the bars just outside, waiting when I'm ready to come out again. This person is life, this person is one I would lay down my very waking life for if only for five minutes with them.   I think the person whom (gram?) this is for will know it. I really thought of you a second ago, and you really just inspired me to type this down...I wanted you to know that I'm thinking about you, and I thank you for everything that you mean, and everything that you've done and will do. My heart will always save the greatest place for you.
