I think I needed that after working out my poor outta shape and now sore body. Came home and took a shower and took my sister shopping to prepare for Kings Kamp. She decided to decorate her cabin in a "Grease" theme. We went to Bonnie's in Ventura and got a bunch of 50s Rock  Roll decorations (inflatable guitars, an inflatable microphone, two cardboard juke boxes, black musical notes, some old records, etc.). She got each of her girls a packet of jelly bracelets too. I was hoping that would help her room bond. :-)   Later in the afternoon I got a call from Jack from Conejo. He asked if I would like to work with the new ym from Culver Palms on the campfire devotionals every night at Teen Camp. I'm pretty excited about that. That's one of my favorite parts of camp.   This evening I met my roommates, Chris and his wife Amy, and Amy's friend Elsa at B.J.'s for dinner. It was nice. Came home and got ready to see the midnight showing of The Village. I called Edwards to double check everything--it would be awful to have a bunch of teenagers waiting at the theater at midnight only to find out it wasn't showing. Well, it's a good thing I did because it wasn't showing. In fact, it's not showing anywhere in Ventura County tonight. :-) C'est la vie. And now I can go to bed earlier. I was a little worried about lack of sleep as I headed into a double header of camps.
