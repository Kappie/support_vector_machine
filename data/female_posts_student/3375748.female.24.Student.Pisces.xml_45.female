They spend whole day walking in NY and visit this big apple. We went to couple places together, and Masa decided go empire State Building. That was kind of late, around 8 p.m. Toshi and I decided go tothe Japanese Barrestaurant "Fight"first."Fight" is always busy even that day wasn't weekend. We had to wait for around 30 mins to have site. Whilewe was waiting,I made a cotton ball.Hahaha, kind of childlike, but it's ok. When we had site, we ordered seaweed salad and Edamame first. We were wondering if Masa could make it to ESB and "Fight", but we didn't wait for long. Masa and Yayoi camewith asad face because they had to wait for 2 hoursif they wanna go to thetop of ESB. They just gave up. We spend3 hours in the "Fight" and talked about all kinds of stuff. That was good time. On the way back to Flushing, I was so triedin the subway. But, once when I got in my car, I was awake.There wasn'tmany cars on the high way. We only use 45 mins to get home, and Masa and Yayoi weresleeping in my car (well, everybody does).  urlLink      urlLink
