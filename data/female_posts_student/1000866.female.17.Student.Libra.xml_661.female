If I weren't in band, I wouldn't have to take summer school. I'd have room in my schedule for the stuff I need to take. Grrrr. Oh well. I have a few free days.   My math test today wasn't bad at all. A lot easier than I expected. I also got my recommendation letter from Mrs. Kistler so now I can turn in my application at Marianjoy. Exciting stuff.   It's nice having this year over though. I think senior year will be a lot more fun and exciting and....well, honestly, there's a lot more to look forward to at the end of next year than there was this year. Although, I AM going out to lunch with my friends today. :) So, I had that to ook forward to.   So, I'm outta here. I'm gonna go have some summer fun! :)
