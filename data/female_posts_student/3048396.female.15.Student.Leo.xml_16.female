I had a few pages of Science to do and 150 algebra problems..I'm still workin on it now. Ugh. It sucks...anyway atleast I can sleep in now. Only problem will be Sunday morning...getting up at 5 so I can get to church early to help start makin the breakfast. I love our churches Easter Breakfast. The eggs are to die for. lol So yeah. This week was kind of boring...I really don't know why I'm writing I have nothing to say. I guess I'm just really bored. *sigh* Well today I went and got my hair permed again and cut a little bit. It is soo cute now! I love it. And its super short now. I love short hair. Tho long would be nice...but I dont have enought patience to let it grow all out. So I guess I'll be short-ish forever. I'll make my daughter have long hair. lol So yeah...otherwise nothing new is up except Im in another fight with my dad. He wont let me do anything durring our break but sit here at home. *sigh* Im trying to get through to him...and It just might work. So other than all that...I have nothing else to say....  -Tara
