I can't remember exactly, but I think Picture People is more expensive and you get 1 less pose, but you get your photos back a lot sooner or something.  Anyway, if we could get this together soon, it'd be cool, cause I am asking my parents to pay for it for Christmas, heehee. Since I have had no money since the beginning of time. riiiight.
