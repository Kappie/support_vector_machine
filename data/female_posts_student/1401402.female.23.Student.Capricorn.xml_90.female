I never had any spare time to face reality for my own personal uses. A couple of friends have complained about me not posting anything up for them to read. My bad my bad. I didnt know that my words are that meaningful to some people. But hey, guess what I'm back for good WA LA and I've got plenty of things to blah blah blah about.   A month ago, I file for child support.  Yep!!! I took the courage and do what I had to do. A couple of days ago, I received a phone call from an attorney from the child support services department. To tell you the truth I am very scared. I am just concern about what would happen to Alyssia? Will I get money every month? Do I have to face him in court? Would Alyssia be under my care or his?   I held back and hold on strong. Again and again I would tell myself to take a deep breath and keep my mind strong. I cant lose and I wont give up. I cant keep running from everything all the time. Sooner or later, its gonna hit me in the face when I turn a corner in life. I have to face him and I am going to make sure he knows that since he took a part in creating the baby, he's gonna take a part in supporting her.   I know that I am so scared of losing Alyssia but I'm pretty sure that there wont be any problem with the court deciding in my favor, or if he has a delinquent in his child support payments. It all comes down to whats best for Alyssia and me.   I wonder if I can amend her last name as well.
