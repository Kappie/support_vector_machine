See, i want to be there when the beatles first came of the plane into america. I would totally be one of those screaming girls. I would also be the girl who skipped church to go to the ed sullivan show. My mum would be quite angry.  We need something like the beatles. This generation is weak, we need something to hold us together! We need something to obesess about!  I'm out.. laura
