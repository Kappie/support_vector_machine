As the lighting quickly went back to the dim yellow, Wallace began to regain his senses. He turned to Mark and gave him a nod. Wallace pointed to the stairs and motioned Mark to follow close behind.             “I think he went up the stairs” Wallace whispered as he placed his hand on the railing of the stairs.              “How do you know? It disappeared right in front of us!” Mark said, in a clearly disturbed voice.             “That isn’t possible Mark; he must have gone up stairs. He couldn’t have moved passed us down the hallway” Wallace explained.             Wallace and Mark moved up to the very top of the stairs to find more blood on the floor. Yet, the stairs did not have any; moving down the upstairs hallway they stopped as one of the doors was slightly opened.             “I’ll check inside you go on ahead” Mark said as he opened the door and peeked inside.             Wallace continued down the hallway, while Mark disappeared behind the jarred door. Sheriff Wallace slowly and quietly moved down the hallway and finally stopped at the end. Where there was a single door, light was coming from inside.             “Why is there a light on? The power is out all over town…” Wallace said to himself as he put his hand on the door knob.             As he pushed the door inward, he placed his hand on the safety of the gun and switched it off. Slowly, Wallace entered the room. The light was so bright that Wallace couldn’t really see what was giving off light.             As Wallace’s eyes began to finally focus on the source of light, he noticed that it looked like the figure that Mark and him saw downstairs. He still couldn’t make out what the figure looked like.             “Who are you? What are you doing in this house?” Wallace said as he pointed the gun at the figure.             As he said those words a loud thump came from the hallway that drew Wallace’s attention. As he looked over and then looked back, the light had faded and the figure completely disappeared.             “What is that thing?” Wallace whispered to himself.             After standing there looking around for evidence, as if still looking for the figure; he quickly turned around again as he heard the sound that occurred just a few moments before.             “Mark! What is going on out there” Wallace yelled, yet when he went silent to listen for an answer, he heard none.             “Mark! Are you hearing me?” Wallace repeated again, hoping this time that his call will be returned, but it was not.             Wallace quickly swung around and exited the room that had once contained the figure they were so desperately looking for. As he exited he noticed that the door that Mark entered was shut. He stealthy moved down the hallway and placed his hand on the door knob.             Appling pressure to the door, he slowly went to push it in. Wallace’s pressure was then met by an equal pressure from the other side. It seemed as if something was holding the door shut.             “Mark, if you’re trying to play a joke on me, it isn’t funny” Wallace said as he gritted his teeth. Wallace then knew that Mark wasn’t playing a joke, and that Mark had never played a joke on anyone in his life.             With a worried look on Wallace’s face, he decided to ram the door inward. As he backed up to prepare for a charge into the door, it suddenly swung open. Standing there in the doorway was Isabel.             “Isabel! You’re alright!” Wallace said in complete surprise.             Wallace then realized that she wasn’t alright, she was obviously crying and she was soaked in blood.             “Isabel! What happened in here? There is blood all over the kitchen! And I saw a strange figure in the house!” Wallace jumped from one statement to another, not giving Isabel any time to respond.             “Wallace… where is Mark?” Isabel quietly responded without emotion.             “I don’t know, we split up, I thought he went into the room you just came out of” Wallace then replied, but reluctantly as if he did not trust her enough with the information.             “Are you sure you are okay?” Wallace then added as he moved to put his hand on her shoulder.             “Don’t touch me!” Isabel suddenly screamed as if she suddenly awoken from a deep sleep.             Isabel began to rock side to side, and mumble to herself. Isabel turned to the stairs and began to walk down them. As she reached the bottom, she stopped moving and starred at the closet door. Wallace was eyeing her carefully as he began to follow her. Wallace looked down and waited for her to move, but could tell she had zoned out again.             “Isabel you stay right there! I am going to check around upstairs more!” Wallace yelled, but knew Isabel hadn’t even heard him speak.             Wallace turned back from the stairs and walked towards the door that Isabel just came out of. Walking in, he noticed that the floor (like the kitchen) was covered in blood.             “What the hell?” Wallace said to himself as he looked at the floor, continuing to walk in.             He pushed the door open a little wider, and then stopped when he noticed there was something behind it that was causing resistance. With fear, Wallace began to pull the door back so that he could see what was behind it.             “Oh my god” Wallace said in horror when he saw what was on the floor, behind the door.             Wallace looked at the back of the door, only to find two hand prints on it. Hand prints that had been there, trying to keep him out a couple of minutes before. His eye’s looked down and saw that Mark was lying on the floor. Dead, his head looked as is someone had hit it with a bat. Blood soaked his uniform, and the entire floor below.             Wallace glanced up in the air as if he just realized something and turned and ran out of the room, slipping on the blood as he went.             “Isabel don’t you move!” Wallace screamed as he pulled his gun from it’s resting place once more.             Yet, when Wallace reached the stairs, he saw that Isabel was no longer at the bottom. He suspiciously crept down the stairs glancing around to make sure there was no one waiting for him at the bottom.             As he finally reached the bottom, he noticed the exact spot in which Isabel was standing. There were imprints of her feet in the blood that had covered the floor. He then began to follow where the prints were heading. As he reached the end of the tracks, he saw that they went directly into the closet.             “Isabel! Get out of the closet right now! Step out with your hands in the air!” Wallace screamed as he took a step back and pointed the gun at the door.             “Wally? Help” Isabel screamed a muffled yelp.             Wallace stood there confused for a minute, and then began to hear nails scratching on the door.             “Isabel step out of the closet right now!” Wallace remained standing and steadied his gun.             The last noise Wallace heard from the closet was a soft thump and then silence. He quickly walked forward and pulled at the door, yet it wouldn’t open. He placed the gun back in its holster and grabbed the knob with both hands and began to pull frantically.             “Isabel! Isabel! Answer me!” Wallace yelled as he pulled one last time before losing his footing on the floor and falling.             Wallace lay on the floor starring at the ceiling, when he heard something in the closet once again. He heard the door open up, as he tried to move, he noticed that he couldn’t. His heart beat quickened as he heard someone stepping closer and closer to him. He tried lifting his head, yet the pain was so great that he was unable to. The stepping stopped and he looked up at what was looking down at him. It was Isabel; she was looking in his eyes, as he was looking in hers.             “Where is Emily…? What have you done to Mark…?” Wallace managed to squeeze out in between the shots of pain in his back.             Isabel did not answer though, and she continued to look into Wallace’s eyes. The pain began to take the better of Sheriff Wallace, he lost consciousness and everything went black. The last thing he was looking at was the lifeless look in Isabel’s eyes.             Wallace stirred back and forth on the floor. He opened his eyes and closed them again, trying to make the pain in his back go away. It was no use though, he knew something was broken and that he would not be able to move.             “Isabel where are you?” Wallace finally broke the silence in the house, expecting to see Isabel near by.             “What is going on in here? Please call 911, I think my back is broken” Wallace pleaded to an uninterested ear.             He began to move his head around a bit, just so he could see if anyone was around him. That is when he noticed that the closet door was wide open. And when he looked down, he saw the Isabel was no longer in it. He looked at the back of the door, and there were those bloody hand prints again. Just like in the room upstairs. He could only study them for a second when a shot of pain went up his back, and he had to put his head on the floor again.
