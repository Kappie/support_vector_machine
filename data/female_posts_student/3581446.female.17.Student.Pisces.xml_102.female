Granted, she ain't as pretty as a good Southern Belle, but she's still not hard on the eyes. She looks to be a decent weight, but how many photographers would dare let her wear a Bikini like that now? She couldn't even get a job doing those magazine covers I bet! Just a thought.  My Uncle has nothing to do at his place of employment on most days, so he and I often correspond. Here is an excerpt from what I wrote him on the movie  Bowling for Columbine :   I just finished watching this movie. I downloaded it online. It was pretty interesting. Obviously, Michael Moore's argument was way left, and he didn't exactly give the viewer a crystal clear, fair picture of the situation with firearms and violence, but who does? The only good point I think the film really made was that television and the media are the greatest threats we face in the country. The only thing more through-and-through evil, in my opinion, are big evil corporations like Wal-Mart. It was kind of funny watching him embarrass rich people like Kmart, Dick Clark and Charlton Heston, though I kind of felt bad for the last.   I also think Michael Moore exploited the victims of Columbine for his own malevolent purposes, but who is surprised by that? It was entertaining to watch, and if you haven't seen it, I recommend that you do.
