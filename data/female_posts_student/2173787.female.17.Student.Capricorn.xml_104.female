Been in a good, lazy mood the past two days so no real emotion in anything I wrote.  It seems that no one updates their blog anymore, at least not with a high frequency, is that because everyone is content-ish?  Break is over which majorly sucks...only 63 real school days, 6 ex days, 2 flex days and 4 exam days until summer!
