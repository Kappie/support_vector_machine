Thank you so much for sending the evite and organizing my return party at Paddy's.  I really hope everyone can make and don't worry I won't forget the photos. So, we are all set for Thursday evening. Thank you Paddy for opening up your home for an intimate gab session of the ECI trash-cakes.   Today was nice, busy though. We piled everyone back on the ship to return to Alaska this evening. We have a slightly different itinerary this cruise so it will cool to see and explore new the places I haven't seen. (Icy Strait Point).  This will be our first time in port here so I am in charge of setting the inaugural press conference and attending with the Captian. Sucha a photo op, ugh. Hahaha. Listen to my wee complaints. So, not even valid.   Meanwhile, I am getting very excited about my vacation to Bermuda.  I have only spoken briefly with Lizaki but I know she is getting siked too. She keeps telling me that she thinks I am going to kill her while we are in Texas.  I think she's terrified of meeting real Texans though. Hahaha. She's so funny though. I think everyone will get a kick out of here. Hopefully she won't tell too many stoires about stupid things I have done onboard. Hahaah.   Tonight is a little low key for me. Just kind of hanging out after the welcome aboard shows. I am watching the first season of 24 right now and damn it's good. I love watching them back to back. So, my little lame life will be in my cabin this evening, unless of course, Helen astarts banging down my door to go to the crew bar.   Smooches to everyone. See you in 11 days.   Shelly
