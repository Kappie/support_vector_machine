I took about 5 rolls of film.  I can't wait to get them developed, they're gonna be awesome.  The funniest part about the whole weekend has gotta be when the guy I was riding with ran out of gas on the interstate.  We were like 3 frickin miles from a gas station.  So we just sat there hoping the super troopers wouldn't drive by while we waited for the other car to get a tank of gas.   well, I've got a crapload of homework that I need to do....so....bye
