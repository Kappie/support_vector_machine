Needless to say, it did not turn out electric blue as I had hoped, but a very interesting green... in areas, my hair is blue, green, blonde and brown. Depends on how you look at it and how I wear it. Mostly in braids, because the color stays mostly blue and green that way. I have plans though. After it washes out some, I'll re-blonde it, then dye it dark and light blue. Maybe streak it purple. Keep it interesting. I can't believe how un-dyeable my hair is though. We ran out of blonde before we did hair. Oh well. Whatever.  Laura's planning on redding her hair, so maybe before the New Year's party we'll color it up together. Heeey...what an idea. We were just saying how much we wanted to do another marathon..what about a hair-dying-movie-marathon with New year's!!!! Must...Email..Laura!!  Anyways, Merry christmas ya'll out there, have a happy, think of me :) and I'll be bloggin when I get the chance. Chow!
