"Well before we can answer that question, we must first both agree on the terminology at hand. Notably, the concept of ‘date’ and or ‘dating’ itself. Without this it’s impossible to know if it’s even applicable to the present context, thus being a question worth answering at all."  "Uh... Okay. I guess a date is when two people go out. And maybe there’s some romantic intention?"   "You’ve just described any two people who have ever been together in the same place at the same time. It’s my belief that what we perceive as ‘intention’ is merely a form of human recognition at work, an irrational process indicative of our nature. Intentions are only remembered and relevant in relation to the result, moreover placing what the given intention is to be determined by the person experiencing it after the result has become apparent. In that way, the validity of an intention is left solely based on the individual, which I cannot ubiquitously trust, on principle."   "I don’t know what the hell you just said."   "Then we cannot agree, and further discussion is unprofitable. The answer is indeterminate."   "So it’s not a date?"   ...    Am I talking to a wall?  "Dammit woman! It can’t  not  be a date anymore then it  can  be a date. In essence what you ask demands that I attack the definition of the nature of reality itself, that I hem the fabrics of our malleable perceptions into something coalescent and processable. You seek answers to debates which have been confounding the most brilliant minds humanity has yet produced for eons past and will confound for eons to come. You ask that I bottle these answers and give them to you in shades of black and white. You ask more then any man can give!"   "Forget I asked."   "You don’t understand what I’m trying to avoid here, a communicative entropy. I could superficially give you an answer. But, in doing so, I would compromise the meaning of the interaction, and in doing so the value and entire point. The implications of my ‘yes’ would undoubtably become trans-mutated into whatever the basis of your ‘yes’ is. Your question ‘is this a date’ could be one of infinite meanings and therefor one of infinite consequences;  which  all depend solely on the definition of the word ‘date’,  which  we have already decided is indeterminate for all fucking intensive purposes! Don’t you see what I’m trying to avoid here? I’m trying to keep us both on the same page."   "I said forget I asked."   "Okay. I just don’t want you angry at me."   "I’m not."   "Good."  Damn... that was a close one. Derailed that train. Why is it so hard to breath? It must be her. She’s so tense, it’s rubbing off on me. Dammit. Wait. We’re not talking now. Hmm. This feels awkward. Oh shit. This is an awkward silence. Say something. What should I say? Who cares.  "So, I don’t know that much about you. What’s your favorite color?"   "That’s kind of an odd question to ask."   "Oh? I really don’t think so."   "Your not going to tell me that colors are relative or something?"   "Well, granted, how we divide the spectrum into shades is the result of our cultural socialization. If you’ve studied any of Victor Turner’s work, you’d know he explored the widespread classifications of colors in various cultures. The Ndembu of Angola, for example, linguistically identify the entire spectrum into black, white and red."   "That’s fascinating. Yeah. Umm, I really like purple."   "That’s a good color."   "I think so to. Do you feel like your getting to know me better?"   "Peripherally. Whether or not you think so, the color question was more insightful then it was juvenile. Colors are processed by humans to have meaning beyond their literal value. They become symbols of abstractions we have no other way of indicating, much like words themselves. I would argue them to be a form language, but that’s just me." Ah. Don’t laugh at your own jokes. She should know I have a sense of humor though.    "Yeah. I think it’s pretty. One tim-"   "Beauty. A mystery to behold. It’d be interesting to study beauty, what constitutes it on a personal and or social level. I remember reading something about it subconsciously being related to the symmetry of the person in question, but that raises many more questions. How does one delegate the concept of beauty when applying it to nonhuman objects, such as architecture? Is it dependent on the level of artistic design, or how it conforms to a preformed expectation of what that building ought to be? Fascinating. The psychology of beauty. What do you think?"   "I think I’ve found the answer to that impossible question."   "Amuse me."   "This isn’t a date."   Copyright 2004 Dave Agnor
