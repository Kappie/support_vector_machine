I have Daniel to blame- er, thank for that. And its silver, and distinguished i'll have you know.  Hey, Captain Jack, explain to me just how Rum helps with communication. 'Cause here i am thinking that alcohol, being a muscle relaxant and reducing co-ordination and all that crap wouldn't help. Specially somehting as strong as neat rum...i've allways found that it makes it  harder  to talk. And be understood at least.  Any place with a glowing-eyed 'demon' leader is no place i wanna be. Unless i get to shoot it.
