A comment had been posted  in the entry in which I discussed breaking my dad's rules.  And my dad has been known to snoop around the web history when we're not around. I do believe 2 + 2 = 4? So I started to freak out. I'm completely paranoid about my dad (not without cause) and I was positive that he'd posted something about how I was a deceitful little witch who was grounded for the summer. This was especially alarming because recently he's been acting kind of weird. He always wants me to keep my room spotless, but lately he's been coming into it (and it looks horrible, like a tornado's run though it) and saying nothing. I wish I knew what he was up to. He's probably going to bawl me out this weekend, saying how he gave me the chance to prove that I could be responsible without being ordered, and this just proves that his scolding is necessary. Or else he's assigned the task of disciplining me to my mom. If that's the case, he'll be back on my case soon. I can't see him being able to bear the mess in my room without saying anything. Anyway, all the panic was for naught- it turns out the comment was from someone else, which surprised me. I didn't think that anyone would actually read this. Thanks  stargirl  (love that book), and by the way, the girl in my profile-picture isn't me. Sorry. I look exactly like that when I'm reading though, and Google-ing was much more convenient than borrowing a digital camera and making a mess. I think I'll try to post a different picture- we'll see how that works out.   Tuesday's my birthday. I am completely underwhelmed by how excited everyone is. I'm having no party, again. (Well, last year there was the Chuck E. Cheese thing, but to quote Xander, "No power on this earth...") The only presents I'm getting are the result of me telling my mom exactly what she was going to get for me and exactly where she was going to get it from. I do have to credit Henna though; she actually remembered my birthday, and asked what she should get me. It would be kind of nice to have a party with someone other than my grandparents, but I've had too many bad experiences in the past, which I don't feel like going into right now. I'll just say that wiping Ian's poopy butt and a singing Chuck E. Cheese comes into it.   Just a few more Birthday 2004 facts. Presents requested include:  Nevermind  by Nirvana,  The Wall  by Pink Floyd,  A Rush of Blood to the Head  by Coldplay (CDs) and  The Basic Eight  by Daniel Handler and  Why Girls Are Weird  by Pamela Ribon (books). There's also  une belle affiche de Buffy  (a beautiful  Buffy  poster). I'd link to it if it was possible; the poster, I mean. It's from season one, and it's all gothic, with red and black clothes and thick eyeliner. All the characters are in a warehouse or something. You can find it at  urlLink AllPosters  if you try. My grandparents asked what I wanted and I said nothing, which is kind of true. All the things I listed are trifles; my mom's only getting like four of them. The thing I really want is Netflix, but again, more later. That is, if I actually keep posting to this. (Knock on wood) Last piece of trivia- on the eighth I'm having an English quiz that's worth  20% of my grade ! It's just sick to do that to someone on their birthday. Natalia's sick of hearing about it, but c'mon!   On Sunday my grandparents are coming for a birthday celebration. I'm looking forward to seeing the GPs more than usual, as I think the no-presents request has made my grandmother feel kindly toward me. Memere never wants anything at Christmas. She's really religious, and I think the commercialization of Jesus's birth makes her ill. I don't know what we're going to end up doing on Sunday; right now options include bowling, Six Flags, and Uno's. Okay, maybe the fact that they're taking me somewhere nice is a sort of present, but at least I'm not requesting actual items.   Okay, right now I'm ignoring Henna on AIM, so I should really go. Blog with you later.
