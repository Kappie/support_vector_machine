If 2 people really love each other... then what is it that is holding them back? If 2 people are not meant to be together... then why do they still love each other so deeply (or just the 1 of them who is so madly in love)?   What's love? How do u show it that u really care for that person? Why is it that each time you wanted to convey something... it just got misunderstood? Can anyone tell me?    ~Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.~
