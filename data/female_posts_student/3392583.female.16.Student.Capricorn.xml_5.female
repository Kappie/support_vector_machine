It's more like common sense.  Nothing good lasts forever.  You're never completeley safe.  Every once in a while, that expectation surfces to your head, and until that something bad happens, you just have that feeling.  God, now the family owes so much money, and we only just baught a new building.  The buissiness hasn't even started yet, and I'm leeching more money than I already was about to do.  I was born in the year of the rabbit.  That's supposed to fuckin' mean that I'm lucky.  But no, I'm not.  I have the worst frickin' luck in my family.  Bumps and bruises, scars... Well, I suppose I'm lucky that they're not all that visible unless I'm under high physical stress.  Or unless I've been drinking...  Oh well.  We're all doomed in the end.  Death.  We don't know it, so it draws us to it.  Through fear or whatever.   It's almost beautiful.   It's a wonder about how beautiful death and pain could be sometimes. Amazing.  a child dead in his or her sleep, blood gushing from your fingers after a paper cut, or something...  it's almost lulling.  Blood is so red and bright.  Not that I would do anything insane to see tht type of beauty.  But it's there, whether you think so or not.  the human body is beautiful, touch is beautiful, pain; or rather, the feeling after the pain is gone, is beautiful...  meh.  goodbye
