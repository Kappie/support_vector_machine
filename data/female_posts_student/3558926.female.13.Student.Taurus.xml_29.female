(see above band.) my new room is a lot smaller that my room here. barely enough room for my bed and drums. i want elle to come home. cuz im bored. she is good at being bored with me. it is very uneventful when we are bored. and i want her to come back so i can pay her guitar a visit. i went to the mall a couple days ago. we went into zumies and the cashier was sooo cute and i think he smiled at me and i liked his hair. ow. now my neck hurts. oh and there were some wierd people in hot topic. it was cool though. i think my mom was afraid to come in to the store to give us something cuz she reached way around the side of the door and didnt even take a step inside. oh well. i wnt ot keep typing but i have nothing else to say...
