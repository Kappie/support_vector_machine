But we made it safely to our turn around spot. The way back to our car was a much easier than the way up. It was a nice change than cement (I know, I know cement is bad :)). I am not sure how often I am going to run that trail but I am anxious to try more hiking trails. fells good on the feet!    Don't Quite Damn It!!!!    Enjoy your runs.
