I had not heard much about it before I picked it up, but I need a little more fiction in my life. And it's about a woman in Botswana who runs a detective agency. How cool is that?    Anyway, since it is possible that penises will make more than a couple of appearances in my "journal", I thought this an appropriate and funny passage:    "...He was always looking at her and smiling encouragingly, although she was two years older than he was. He tried also to make sure that his leg touched hers, which angered her, and made her shift in her seat, away from him.    But worst of all he would undo the buttons of his trousers and point to that thing that boys have, and expect her to look. She did not like this, as it was not something that should happen in Sunday school. What was so special about that, anyway? All boys had that thing.    At last she told Mma Mothibi about it, and the teacher listened gravely.    'Boys, men,' she said. 'They're all the same. They think that this thing is something special and they're all so proud of it. They do not know how ridiculous it is.'"
