I stitched it a little tight... one day while I was straighening it I snapped the yarn I seamed with. Oops.  12 July edit: Done!  And you can't even tell I used green yarn... w00t!    FINISH both fingerless gloves which I've started over the last few days.  One is top-down; the other is wrist-up.  I've stalled at the thumb on both.  10 July edit: top-down glove finished; not good.   11 July edit: I tried the other glove on before doing the thumb and realised that it's too loose.  As my hands and I hate needles smaller than 3.5mm with all the firey hatred of hell that a faerie (chinchilla) princess can muster, I ain't trying again.  Sorry. (And the same goes for Christmas!)   REBLOCK my FMB.  I'd have to get the gloves-in-progress out first.  15 July edit: Being done now.  If it comes out well, dandy.  If not, big whoop.  How's that for English?   FINISH Mystery Not-Tank #4.  I don't like it anymore (wah) but I'm going to finish it, *then* frog it.  It's hogging my #7 circs.  15 July edit: Almost done... though I'm not sure I'm going to finish it by the end of this week as I'd hoped.   FROG my attempt at socks on two circs, started last October or November.  I haven't worked on them in well over 6 months.  Besides the nasty ladder along the edge, get this... I started them in 100% cotton.  (Stretch has been known to help socks....)  They've been taunting me for the last two seasons, but I think I've finally learned everything that can be taught from such a failure.   10 July edit: I started these because a person asked for red socks.  I didn't *promise* her something but I think she's expecting them anyway.  Current plan - make her a red FMB, keep raggedy dead socks as they are, show her the pathetic socks, give her FMB (sans socks). (wha?)   FINISH this second FMB I just started.  Grumblemuttergrumble.  Remind me why this is so addictive?  15 July edit: Done! Look to the right for link to album.   What else... dunno.  I'll add later.
