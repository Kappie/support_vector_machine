If you look on my sidebar and my links to other blogs its an interesting mix of people.  Most of these people are people I know...they're other whiny twenty-somethings like me, just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in their lives.    Some, like  urlLink Liz  are using their blogs as a journal for personal reflection and to get people on board with their cause.  (Liz and Gary, by the way, are both participating in the  urlLink Avon Walk  to raise money and awareness about breast cancer, go check out their sites and donate, you'll feel warm and fuzzy inside).   urlLink Cacoa , isn't even from the U.S., we're not of the same ethnic or even religious background and still I feel like I can relate to her on a lot of levels.  She's in the midst of a time of self discovery and sorting through everything and I'm not sure precisely what it is, but something about that really strikes a chord with me.  There are M.W.B (mom's who blog), like  urlLink Tina ,  urlLink Judy  and  urlLink Becca , sometimes they talk about their kids, most of the time though, they're just awesome, witty people.  (Not that kids don't make you awesome).   I've got my Ron  Fez friends, my girlie  urlLink my girlie: Anna , some awesome chicks like  urlLink Petrina ,  urlLink Sabrina ,  urlLink Diana ,  urlLink Heather  and  urlLink Shanti  whose sarcasm and sense of humor will make you die laughing.    There are blogs I stumbled upon through reading other people's blogs like  urlLink MadPony ,  urlLink Kzug ,  urlLink LameKing , and  urlLink Completing the Square .  Perhaps most interesting of all of these though is  urlLink Autopsy Report , the blog of a medical student doing their summer internship at the morgue.  Its really interesting, but creepy at the same time.    Most of the blogs I've come across though are because of the one and only, the legend:  urlLink The Boz .  Boz is from Michigan, I've never met him, I do like his moustache, he cracks me up and I enjoy his nonsense.  Plus, he was one of the first non "friend" people to leave a comment on my blog, so for that, he gets the points, plus he's a June baby and made me angel of the month for June too.  Through Boz, I found  urlLink Jonnie  the roaming gnome of the blog world.  He's lived in Vegas, Alaska, California, he knows a schizophrenic McGuyver and he's cute to boot.    Its funny though I don't know half of these people, I've become obsessed with the inconsequential details of their lives.  I look forward every day to reading about what's going on with them or what they've got to rant about.  Its exciting.  In reading I've seen one blogger get married in a secret ceremony of sorts, two people fall in love in Manhattan (though neither is from there),  urlLink a cat  have a cancer scare, and a myriad of other triumphs and tradgedies.  Who says nothing on the internet is real?  Who thought it was possible to find people so scattered and whose lives are so different that you can still relate to?  The little blogospher is a pretty damn cool place if I do say so myself.
