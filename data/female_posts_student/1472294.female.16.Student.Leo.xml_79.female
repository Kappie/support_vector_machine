I love watching Kids Central. Yeah, call me childish or immature but the shows are all my lost childhood which I never get to enjoy. There was Tintin and Archie's weired mysteries and blah blah.... Oh, there is a show THAT IS MUST watch "Holland Village'' on Channel 8. Yeah, that is the long- winded *yawn* 100 over episodes that stars FAT chen liping and other actors. I watched the 1st episode yesterday. My mother was laughing so hard that she forgot it was dinner time. I am going to watch tonight again...
