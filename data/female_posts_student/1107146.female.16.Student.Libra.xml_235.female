I won't be ignored again Outside here, it's a lonely place and I'm Trying to figure out where this began  CHORUS I'm apart and struck at the heart The whole world hears my cries And you thieved to the point of deceit But if you care, please close my eyes Another down, my pain is renowned The thorn is in my side Hollow feats make a man of the meek And if you care, please close my eyes  Hey I'm here and I'm thinking about Why I never went away I've been trying hard to live without Your sweet touch within my brain  CHORUS a few times, nothing special  It's so damned simple, but it's really awesome, minus the shoddy production job, as usual.
