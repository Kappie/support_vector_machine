Now I have another hour and 50 minutes to sit here.  What a waste.  The new trimester sucks.  I have a dance class first hour, I hate dance.  Why did I even sign up for it?  I'd rather be in art.  I asked my school counselor if I could switch, but nooooo.  So basically, I have to take a class that I...    1. don't like or have no interest in doing    2. I will probably fail anyway I hate this school, and the counselors who think they have all the answers and can tell who I am just by the grades I get or the way I act or the clothes I wear or by the problems I have, that they don't know about.  Why is it that whenever I talk to a counselor or psychiatrist about my mom having breast cancer, they assume it's the reason I'm so angry or worried?  To tell you the truth, it didn't really affect me. They assume that because Ellie is having her problems and issues and now she takes them out on me, i'm just concerned about her.  Bullshit.  Hey Ellie, are you reading this?  THEY'RE WRONG!  I don't give a rat's ass about you anymore.  You've completely fucked me over, blamed me for all of your problems and for intruding in on your life 15 years and 1 month ago.  But I don't give a shit about you anymore.  The only good things that come out of having you as a sibling is music, computer programs and movies, clothes, and occasionally some use of the makeup you leave sitting on the counter when you're home.  You have no emotional effect on me anymore.  Your feelings don't influence me, I just don't care.  You're selfish, inconsiderate, egotistic, and just a pain in the ass.  You ruin my day every time you're home.  You wake me up in the middle of the fucking night, and why? just so you can have the fucking TV to play your Xbox.  And to the parents, my educations isn't as important as a way for you to get to work, when Galaxie House is less than two fucking miles away.  You ruin everything, and you never give a shit.  And I hate having to change my entire daily schedule, my entire LIFE just to suit yours.  You're a lazy ass slob, who can't even put toilet paper on the roll.  And you say you clean up after my messes?  Bullshit.  Go to hell and don't even say you're in hell,  because even I could make your miserable self-indulgent world hella worse.   I'm done for now.
