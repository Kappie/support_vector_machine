Every month it's restarted and archived. I also realized that some of these posts make me seem messed up... which is not the truth. I'm awesome. Posts that are so dramatic and sad are just me when I'm venting about really specific things that I'm upset about, but I don't neccessarily want to tell you what it is, or when I'm just in a bad mood and all these things that I've ALWAYS wanted to say just come out... And that's what's been going on lately. And if any of those involve you in any way, you would KNOW. I'd rough ya up.   >:P     Hehe. Wow I just get so introspective and melodramatic when I write... which is weird cause it's me. But maybe now you know these things I think about that I never tell you. Hmm interesting.   ****But now the Jason Mraz concert just like totally made everything go away and I think I'll ride that train for a while****   :D :D
