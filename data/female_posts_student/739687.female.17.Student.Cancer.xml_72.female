Because my parents are freaks about clean water, so they are putting a water softening/filtering unit inside the house. We have one outside the house, now inside the house, one under the kitchen sink, and a brita filter. Not to mention the stuff in the brita filter goes into a container in the refrigerator, so the water is always nice and cold. FREAKS I TELL YOU! Haha...it's pretty funny how obsessive they are. Ah well...at least I have extremely clean, softened, filtered, cold water. :-P
