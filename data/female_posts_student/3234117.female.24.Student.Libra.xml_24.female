I was asked if I ever did such things with my friends when I was younger and immediately responded no, thinking I was never that un-cool.  But then I got to thinking and realized I must be un-cool because not only did I have matching bathing suits with my friend, I also had matching watches, shoes, and clothes that we routinely wore on the same day. Now this doesn't sound bad, but this all did not occur when I was younger, it occurred last summer when I was working at the  urlLink Austin Nature and Science Center  with my friend  urlLink Amy  (she is the one in the middle).  Everyone thought we were crazy that summer!  You'd think it would be a perfect summer job.  All we had to do was walk a group of 7-8 year olds to  urlLink Deep Eddy  (a pool in Austin), swim with them, and walk them back all during the hours of 1-5.  It was actually the summer from hell.  If you like kids stepping on your feet, running into you, getting you dirty, splashing you, getting sweaty, and daily submersing yourself in freezing water you should call the Austin Nature and Science Center as I'm sure they are hiring.  Everyone else loved camp, but Amy and I, I think, loved to complain.  Oh and I also forgot Ben, the lovely boy we put up with that goes to T-State (as he calls it).  So Amy, this post is for you.  Hope you are having fun in Hawaii! I miss you!
