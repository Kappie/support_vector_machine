And a time to pick up the pieces when its all over." its stings. i just dont know what else i can do tho sometimes. sigh... YA know...i'm actually doing A LOT worse in school than i thought. i failed the algebra test today, thus bringing my grade down to a possible d. at most C. i failed the last chemistry test, and got a 0 on the written lab... english i have a B, tho i NEEDED an A for semester averages. and today i was looking at my 6th grade report card....ALL a's and i got a 99 in math..ok i heard Andrew Lee saying he had a 99 in precal....ninety bloody NINE!!!!!!......fuck me. i dont know when it was that i woke up and stoped caring...but i havent been caring lately...too many distractions. too much to think about it. but honestly what am i thinking about for hours on end that i cannot find time to study or practice...??? i have absolutly no clue.  "defend yourself against what gena said" i never meant that offensivly!! eep. i'm sorry. i know your a happy person. Your moods are contagious and i can't help but be happy and smiling when i'm around you when you are too! i love you! schctsophrenia- what my point is here, i'm jsut trying to figure out what i think. all i know it that, i'm single. and i'm actually really fine with it. I am. i dont know anybody that i could be with and still be myself completely the way i want to be. and whats the point if you can't. high school relationship are more and more just disgusting me. i mean ya you see the occasional cute couple coughjessicaandalexcough. heh. but i mean. how can you possible fine someone to worship you like that. exactly. so, why? why should i worry. i can be happy without. sure everyone wants to be loved and wanted. but i've kinda lost faith that you could have that with out all the bullshit that comes along w. it. ssooooooo. saturday? ok, i know we do this b.c, besides the fact that we have no life, it gives up something meager to get through the week for. but, it does seem a bit, depricating? at our expence we're spending our free time in the hopes of maybe going there and seeing someone, who doesn't even really sit down and talk to us. we thought we were so far along, him giving us that sacred purple piece of paper, but, its kinda funny when i think about it...he probably doesn't think about some sophmores that always stare at him.  and would practically lay down for him....BUUUT...idk, it doesn;t make much sence to me anymore. and the whole not seeing him in two weeks, proves that hes not as vital as we thought.  aaaaannnnnnndddddd. guys suck. and girls suck. we're all just so god damn fucked up. people wake up. realize that ppl are not stable beings. you should NOT leave them alone w. themselves. but they are dangerous beings that can think for themselves. and that is always a bad thing. BLARGH! give me a gun, and i wont just start a war.  No Doubt - 80's cover song - Come on Eileen
