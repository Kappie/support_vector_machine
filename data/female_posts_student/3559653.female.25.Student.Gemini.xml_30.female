I'm taking a statistics class and between that and work and the gym and tanning and everything else that keeps me busy in my life, I just haven't had time for anything fun lately, like wasting time posting on here! :) I added a few pics tonight and I have a TON of others to post from the hike that Malcolm and Andrew and I went on at Taylor Head on July 1st. I promise I will try to post them this week when I get a chance. They are all really cool and I definitely want to have them on here! So yeah, that's it for now I guess. I am completely shocked by how fast the summer is flying by--4 weeks from yesterday until Robyn's wedding, 6 weeks until classes start, 10 weeks until the LSAT, ahhhh! I have no idea how I am going to accomplish everything I need to this year--and do well--but I am going to try my hardest! I've put too much effort into getting to where I am school-wise (which is a really good place!), so I won't let something silly like a crowded busy schedule mess things up! Anyway, enough for tonight, I have to keep plugging away at my hateful stats assignment. TTFN folks!     Sookie word of the day:  Nookaragua ( Nook-a-ra-gua ): In Malcolm's words, this sookie word can be defined as "a sookie country run by princess nook nook"!
