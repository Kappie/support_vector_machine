I saw Ryan for the last time for the next two weeks... that's depressing... then around 8:30 I picked up Josh, and consequently his little "friend" Jesse, and I spontaneously drove us to Seattle where we went on the rollercoaster and walked around and yeah... I'm so very bored and for some reason kinda down... I feel like either throwing a pillow at something or just going to sleep. Either way I want to be alone, as if I had a choice. I don't know why this suddenly came over me but I feel... down. I get in these moods when I just feel stupid and tired and unattractive and unloved. And... sleepy. I'm going to sleep. My melodramatic-ness disgusts even myself.
