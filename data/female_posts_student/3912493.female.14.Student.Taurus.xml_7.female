You could have easily seen that the referee was against Mexico and was with Brazil. There were supposed to be several penalties against Brazil, but no. And even one penalty could have changed the results easily. One of them was clearly seen that it was supposed to be a penalty! But no, fuggin' referee has to say it isn't. You know how many faults Brazil made over Mexico? Twenty five. Yellow cards? Two.You know how many faults Mexico did over Brazil? Around ten. Yellow cards? Two. That's not good, or fair.    I know that O. Sanchez is a good goalie, but the defense of Mexico wasn't so good. I don't think it has ever been. So every time that Mexico gets far in a cup, they lose. Don't get me wrong, Mexico has won several cups, and the most recent one has been the Gold Cup (which was in 2003, I think). And guess what? In the Gold Cup they went to the finals against Brazil, and they won against them. Brazil's not a tough rival to Mexico. Mexico could beat their arse any time they wanted. The result was 4-0. See? One fuggin' penalty could have changed everything, because when there was supposed to be a penalty, it was on the second half, minute 20 or so, and the score was 2-0. It could have been 2-1 and change the route of the game, and maybe Mexico could have obtained a tie, and possibly even win. But whose fault was it? The darn referee's. You could easily see that the Brazil player went straight for the Mexican's legs inside the penalty areajust to get him away from the ball. Fug the referrees. Always cheating and getting money for that. Referrees usually are the guilty ones for making a good team lose, and that's because they're not doing a good job at it. You should have seen the face when the score was 4-0 and he gave a yellow card to a Brazilian. He was fuggin' happy, and so was the Brazilian player. Fug them. I hope Brazil loses.    But enough of that. The good thing is that Uruguay won against Paraguay 3-1. Maybe this is what I get after wanting for Paraguay to lose. I only wanted them to lose because I remember Regi told me that her cousins hated Mexico and they were with Paraguay. So that's why I didn't want for them to win, and I was happy when they lost. I bet Regi's cousins were happy when Mexico got kicked off from the cup. So now Argentina is going against Colombia and Uruguay VS Brazil. Here's how I want for it to end. It doesn't matter if Argentina wins or not, but I want for Uruguay to kick Brazil's arse. Though, if Brazil wins, then I wish Colombia could win 'cause I just despise Argentina. So the finals could either be (teams in parenthesis are the ones I want for them to win):    Uruguay VS Argentina (Uruguay)  Uruguay VS Colombia (Doesn't matter, but I'd want for Uruguay to win the cup)  Colombia VS Brazil (Colombia)    If it happens to end up as Brazil VS Argentina, then I want for Brazil to win, though I hope the finals don't end up like that. Uruguay deserves to win, so... GO URUGUAY! And anyone who disagrees must die right now. Fug Brazil and Argentina. I hope they're burning in my closet. *Ice Beams them* Haha, losers. But even though Mexico is out of the cup, Mike makes jokes about Brazil that just make your day better and make this cup a thing of the past. If anyone gets this, then you're so darn spiffy: (brazil) Â¬  But enough of that. If I heard right from my aunt, I think I'm getting $170 dollars from her. I could either be insane or insane. I was half-listening, but she told me that she's gonna give me that much money because she didn't buy me anything while she was here. Also, I had told her that I'm saving up to buy a GCN game (yes, folks, I didn't buy FSA this weekend because my parents didn't have "time" to take me to the mall). So... yeah. If you don't count the money that my aunt is giving me, I have 50 dollars (my other aunt gave me 10 bucks), plus whatever money I get by selling MoHAA. This is good stuff, folks. I love my aunts. So, yeah, they're leaving on Tuesday at 5 AM. Sadness. I have nothing else to write about so I'll close here.
