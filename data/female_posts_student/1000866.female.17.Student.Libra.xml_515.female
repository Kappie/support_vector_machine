Usually I'm not done until like..the day before Christmas. Boo ya grandma. Haha, Mary Clare says that all the time. It seemed to fit in this context.   I think I'm going to go to sleep now since I have to be up early tomorrow for church, then to go play at Justin's church. Hopefully it'll be fun and hopefully I don't catastrophically mess up. YaY sleep!
