The blood is from last night.  My dog pushed me off my bed, and I smashed my head against the bookcase corner.  Now this morning, I wake up, feel my head, and I'm like, Shit!  What the hell, their's this huge bump.  I go over to the mirror to check it out, and it's all black and blue around it.  This sucks.  And it's not like I can even cover it up to well.  Oh well.  Hopefully it will go away later.
