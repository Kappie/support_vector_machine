I don't know what it is with my two older ones, but they insist on fighting 24/7.  I am so serious.  My head is killing me today.  UGH.  Anyway, enough of me complaining.  For those of you who read this, I am quite sure you got e-mails for the heart walk.  Again, I understand better than anyone if things are tight and you can't make a donation, but if you could pass the word along, that would be wonderful.  I better get going, Ed has to go to Best Buy.  Should be interesting...if nothing else.
