How Could An Angel Break My Heart by Toni Braxton   I heard he sang a lullaby I heard he sang it from his heart When I found out thought I would die Because that lullaby was mine I heard he sealed it with a kiss He gently kissed her cherry lips I found that so hard to believe Because his kiss belonged to me      How could an angel break my heart Why didn't he catch my falling star I wish I didn't wish so hard Maybe I wished our love apart How could an angel break my heart    mmm..mm    I heard her face was white as rain (your face is white as rain) Soft as a rose that blooms in May (soft as a rose in May) He keeps her picture in a frame (I keep your picture) And when he sleeps he calls her name... (I only call out your name) I wonder if she makes him smile (she doesn't make me smile) The way he used to smile at me (I only smile at you) I hope she doesn't make him laugh (she doesn't make me laugh) Because his laugh belongs to me (my laugh belongs to you)    How could an angel break my heart (you are my heart) Why didn't he catch my falling star (I'll catch your star) I wish I didn't wish so hard (don't wish so hard) Maybe I wish our love apart (love falls apart) How could an angel break my heart... (your tender heart)    whoa..oh...yeah    Oh my soul is dying, it's crying I'm trying to understand Please help me    How could an angel break my heart (I never break your heart) Why didn't he catch my falling star (I catch your falling star) I wish I didn't wish so hard (you never wish too hard Maybe I wished our love apart (we're not apart) How could an angel break my heart... what.. oooh....      haIx... s0 sad, s0 pissed, s0 dissapointed, s0 upset, s0 stressed up, s0 unhappy, s0 w0rryin..
