(yes kelly) but no elijah or orlando. (tragic isnt it) but that's because the stupid farters didnt make peter jackson win nor the movie win. o well, they no better for next year. i bid thee adieu as i am probably going to fall asleep on the computer because of the sleep deprivation i'v been thru since my birthday. yes, if u havnt guessed im 14. but if ur up to date, u should no i'v been 14 for like 5 days now. away to thee i flee. no wait, scratch that. away to bed i flee. adieu adieu adieu. (yes, i'v been reading ode to a mockingbird, how'd u guess) i'm gonna make a song out of that poem sumday. and my band's name is going to b troubadors of the modern era. bwahahahaha. i'd better go now.
