Everyone with the last names "A-L" had to sit out in the burning hot sun for half an hour while Dr. Rosenau just told us the same things over and over that he could have told us in the nice cool auditorium instead of outside where we would have graduation.  I mean, we didn't even do anything.  GOD.  Die, Dr. Rosenau, die.  And the best thing is, is that he's leaving on "sebatical" the year that we leave Welsh Valley.  We never get to experiance Welsh Valley without him.  Double grrrrrr.  Anyways, on a more sane note, I got a 96 on my Extra Credit, Open Note Science Final!!! That is the same as my current average, so I get 10 extra credit points that I don't need!  Isn't that amazing?  I feel really sorry for Tim though, cause he got a 90 on it, and has a 91 average.  If he had gotten one more question right, he would have gotten an A for the quarter.  Poor Timothy.  Well I've ranted enough for today, so I shall stop now, though I know you don't want me to stop.  Lol.  ONLY 5 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!! ...la Gu
