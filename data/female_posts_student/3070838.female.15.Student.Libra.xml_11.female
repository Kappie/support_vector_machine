I am doing Hero, by Enrique Iglesias (thus the title of the post). Travis is doing "The Middle", by Jimmy Eat World (I don't know WHY they picked that name). and Andrew is doing something by Nickleback- we can never remember the name! I think it's When I'm Gone. OK, If yal get a chance, go  urlLink here . This is a movie called "Badger" and it's so hilarious. If you watch it, after a while you'll just be laughing, besides yourself or what you think you won't be doing.  Luv u Guyz 4-Ever. If you have anything interesting to say, gimme a call or email me or something. You know I love to talk! Philadelphia
