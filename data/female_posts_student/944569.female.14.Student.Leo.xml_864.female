And you know those Happy bunny tests on Quizilla..Well there was the same bunny with his hands convering his ears and undernath it said "not listening" it was really funny..I also saw all these other shirts with Sesame Street Characters.It was really cool..and my new favourite SHIRT which i will get when Ruth goes shopping with me is...It has a girl and a boy..and underneath it says..   Boys ar stupid..throw rocks at them...Another one said..Stupidity Factory...Where boys are made. It was so great.
