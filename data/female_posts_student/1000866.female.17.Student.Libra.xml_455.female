It'd be nice if I could actually meet him though or even talk to him. Haha, maybe I can call him from Lauren's house tomorrow. I'd just go to his house but he doesn't even live that close to Lauren I don't think...  I think I need to at least go get SOME sleep before the car ride. I mean, I don't think I can sleep for the whole thing. I almost feel guilty when I do that since my mom is driving and it's like...oh, you have to do all the work while I sleep comfortably in the back seat.   It was fun. I was talking with Bryan and I was trying to type incorrectly. Ex: how r u? It was actually really difficult for me to do. I think I've gotten so accustomed to typing like this, typing out my you's and such that it's just really difficult for me to think another way. I'm a pretty fast typer too. Or, I'd like to think I am. I guess I'm really not sure. I do the one finger thing. I only type with my two index fingers.   Crazy, yet amusing...  OK, sleepy time, then Michigan time. :)
