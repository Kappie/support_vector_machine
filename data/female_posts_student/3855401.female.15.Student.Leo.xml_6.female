I tried to get Wayne but he wouldn't let me because of Thryn, damn Thryn... that and he wanted it on his inner thigh!... sick bastard. haha. wow, i have nothing to post about at all. i'm shocked because Zach Johnson didn't call me tonight. He broke our tradition of calling at 1:30 in the morning. Maybe he was calling other girls! :-0! Better not have been other wise i'd kick his ass.... well probably not because i wouldn't care, but i'd be a little sad that he broke our tradition :(. I have realized that i'm really lame, and that this post is a waste of space, but i will publish it anyways! I love my cat (Little Matt Skiba) shes the best cat in the world, and the only woman i need in my life. except Steph and Danielle, oh and Ginnie. I love Ginnie, shes the second only woman in my life. :) okay. i'm going to go now, because i just keep rambling.  Make a leaf pile, RAKE!
