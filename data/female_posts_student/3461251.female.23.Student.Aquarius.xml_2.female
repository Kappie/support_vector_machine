I guess with them finally moving on with there lives and having girlfriends, it's something I'll just have to get use too.  Any way, now that Christmas is over and the New years is around the corner I can finally put my mind towards my surgery.  I should know by January 7th or 8th if my insurance approved me the 2nd time around, gosh I hope too!! I have my fingers and toes crossed.  The doctor said if I get approved I'll have a surgery date for January - I can't believe this is finally going to happen and I can FINALLY move on with my life -- I can't wait!!!  However, this is gonna be a LONG weekend -- Mom's in Michigan with John  Sarah, I've been left behind with Dad!! Hopefully, we don't end up pulling each others hair out.... Then again I'll just stay busy cleaning my house and taking all this Christmas crap down, so my house can be clean, simple, and cluter free before surgery!! Everything will be move along smooothlyy!  Alrighty -- Here's the  urlLink Friday Five .....  1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year? ~To be completely honest - I really don't have a big accomplishment for this year other then the fact I finally found a doctor for my gastric bypass surgery.  I know that's not a big thing but if you were in my shoes.... you'd understand! :-)  2. What was your biggest disappointment? ~My grandfather passed away on July 25th -- The reason I'm disappointed is because I never got to say good-bye or I love you or anything because I was to busy with life to take the time an go to Michigan to see him while he was sick or was it because I was selfish or afraid? I'm not sure but someday I'll be able to come to terms with this.  3. What do you hope the new year brings? ~A healthier life, happier life, and me back in college!!!!!  4. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be? ~Yes, My new year's resolution is to get my surgery date and follow the doctors orders and to take ever dang pill that I'm suppose to take!! :-)  5. What are your plans for New Year's Eve? ~My plans for New Year's Eve is to spend time with friends @ Heather's house! :-) I can't wait -- It should be a blast and I'll finally get to meet Tony in person!! YAY!! :-)
