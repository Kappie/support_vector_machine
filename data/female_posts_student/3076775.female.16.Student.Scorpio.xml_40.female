I went to church, came home, watched Conspiracy Theory, talked to Nick on the phone, entertained my little 4 year old cousin, then went back to church. When I got home, I called Barry to chat, because I was bored. He asked if I wanted to come over and watch a movie, so I went over there. When I got there, we went to Bethel to rent movies. We watched Cold Creek Manor, but it was boring, so we turned it off. Then after a while we watched Evil Dead. To be honest, we were both rambling, so we didn't watch too much of it. lol. Then we went to check on the fires he had started before I got there. It was so funny because I couldn't see and there were alotta holes in the yard, so I had to hold his hand the whole time we were outside. I was half expecting Chelsea to leap out of the bushes and mug me for holding her boyfriend's hand. Of course, I also halfway expected NICK to leap out of the bushes and tackle Barry. But, it's not like either of us have feelings for each other. I mean, we both have someone else. lol, it's just that we never get to see them, so we end up talking to each other more than the people we're going out with. Don't worry, Chelsea or Nick! Barry misses you, Chelsea, and I miss you, Nick.....even THOUGH you don't really have an excuse, whereas Chelsea does. OOH! I forgot to get Barry's address for you, Chelsea! sorry! I'll get it tommorrow, if I can remember. Well, it's nearly midnight, and I'm pooped, bushed, fried, dead on my feet....whatEVER you would like to call it. So,I'll talk to everyone later! Tootles! ^_^ Love, Shannon "I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream. I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam. And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem, but if I know you, I know what you'll do: You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream."-Sleeping Beauty
