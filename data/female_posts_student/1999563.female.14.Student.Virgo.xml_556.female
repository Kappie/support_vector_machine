Well, I didn't really fool you because I took that picture like 5 minutes ago..but you thought you would see braces. I told you they are hard to spot..from far away. From closer up I look like a beaver. At least I am a cute beaver!!! Just kidding...I told my mom I looked like a beaver and she was like "NO YOU DON'T!" She is always trying to make me feel better btu you can kinda tell she is lying right through her teeth.  Acctually...now that I examine the photo you can see my braces... never mind... :)  I took a lot of medicene so I am allll better! Well, kinda. I brushed my teeth and did this floride thing.  Yup. I ate bread!! but I couldn't eat the crust because it was french bread so it was really hard.  Emily got sick so she can't come over today. :( Isn't that sad?? I think I am going to get my mom to take me to portland. She said if I could survive braces she would take me there on Saturday..but i want ot go now :)  Dude!  Tomorrow my two brothers are going on a raod trip to California! Isn't that fun?! They are going to surf and stuff like real californians. How wonderful. I really wanted to go but my mom was like "NO!" They are going to sleep in the car and stuff because they can't afford to pay for a hotel. Haha. But I think they are staying one night with my cousin, Breanna, who lives in Pasadena.  How FUN!  And i am going to be stuck at my boring home doing boring things. Waa stinking hoo. :) I like saying that. Hahah. It makes me smile.  When we all graduate we are going on a road trip to Tiajuna (i can't spell that. Haha) Sara, Heather, and I decided this at the ape caves. We are going to steal a bus (Haha!) and paint it pink  (Heathers idea... haha) and renaim it the party  bus. Haha. Sara is going to drive it down there because she said she could pull many all nighters while at the wheel. This will be fun. We can use our mad spanish skills. Hahaha. right... :)   Talk to you all later!!  Sincerely,  Laura Fantora
