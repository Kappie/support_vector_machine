I got this wicked roxyâ„¢ tee shirt...and I cant wear it, because the mf-ing bitchy preps will kill me. Either that or eat me alive. Ouch.  My dad is corny. I come in from school and ask him, as always "Hey, has mom came back home? or, did she call?" He always just smiles, and says no. Whatthefuck?!  Where is she? Why did she leave? Just like anything I ever had that was good. it either dies, or leaves.  cries  Why?! I just want an answer..she doesn't HAVE to come back if she doesn't care..right?  Definetly Right. Just...I dont feel like doing this long update...I'm to busy eating everything I can find! RIP Jenn and David! - Shay
