ONE G'DAMN LINE. in a sense you're killing me, but really, im doing it to myself, just the prompting came from  you . why?? WHY??? drive me to my grave. coz i know you wont tell me. you gotta save yer ass. now lets find out who's "ass" is more important: mine or yours. one line for each day. tonight there will be twenty-one. twenty-one little tallies. four perfect sets of five and one line all alone. yep. twenty-one lines. tomoro there will be twenty-two...
