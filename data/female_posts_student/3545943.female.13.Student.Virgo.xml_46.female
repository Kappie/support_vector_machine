But I stole this from her (who I thought stole it from Rachel Carlson) before, and I'm stealing again my "Life's Questions and Answers" from sixth grade and now.   For a person you loved deeply, would you be willing to move to a distant country, knowing there would be little chance of seeing your friends or family again?   Hopefully, this guy would be my friend, and since it says I would have little chance of seeing my friends again, I wouldn't see him anyway. So no.  I don't know if I believe in love. If it's as perfect as I hope it would be, then yes. He would be my friend and family, first, though.   If you were to die tonight with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven't you told them yet?   I would tell them things I'm not about to post on the internet, and I haven't told them because I don't want them to know while I'm still alive.  Of course I'm not going to say here. I haven't told them because I don't want them to be angry.   If you could spend one year in perfect happiness but afterward remember nothing of the experience, would you do so?   Hell yeah.  I cannot imagine perfect happiness. I do not believe it is possible.   If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the body or the mind of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?   I'd say body, cuz my mind would only get better as I lived through more years of experience. Would you really want to stop learning at 30?  Neither. Let me age with grace. Let me become forgetful and wrinkled. I would rather deteriorate than suddenly drop away while still in good condition.   What would constitute a "perfect" evening for you?   Heh heh heh.  Golly. I worry what I meant by that. Um...drop me in the middle of the woods, alone, with a bowl of ice cream.  Would you rather be extremely successful professionally and have a tolerable yet unexciting private life, or have an extremely happy private life and only a tolerable and uninspiring professional life?  A happy private life, definitely. If my job is tolerable, that's good enough for me. I only work for money for my private life, anyway.  Private life. I don't have rich fantasies about having a job I love. Maybe I'm just pessimistic. But I'd rather have something to go home to than not want to go home.   Would you be willing to become extremely ugly if it meant you would live for 1,000 years at any physical age you chose?   Not a chance. 1,000 is way too long. I'd forget to embrace the moment, and I'd turn lazy.  I love Elm's answer. Go read hers.   If you could wake up tomorrow with any new ability or quality, what would it be?   Ummm...flight, maybe?  Oh, I don't know. Somehow, having an ability quite suddenly doesn't seem very appealing. I'd like to work for it. But I'd still like flight.   You have the chance to meet someone with whom you can have the most satisfying love imaginable. Sadly, you know that in six months, the person will die. Knowing the pain that would follow, would you still want to meet the persona and fall in love?   Of course I would!  Satisfying? I don't much need to be satisfied. I'm never satisfied. I wouldn't like to fall in love just to lose him. Satisfaction is not high on my theoretical list of priorities.   Do you prefer being around men or women? Do your closest friends tend to be men or women?   My closest friends are female, but I think that's mainly cuz mens' minds work in different ways, and I find it hard to communicate with them. Don't get me wrong, though, I have nothing against guys.  I don't really have much in the way of male friends. I just don't really like any of them that I know. Maybe they'll grow out of their immaturity?   Have you ever hated anyone? If so, why and for how long?   I have never really hated anyone, and I don't believe that you can say how long you hated someone, because I think that hate is something that lasts forever, otherwise it's only intense dislike. I have intensely disliked several people."--Alexa Neelie Zarshall Frommassachusetts (If you don't know who that is, SHAME ON YOU!!!) Her words are true, though. I agree completely.  I don't know if I still think hatred lasts forever. I wish there were two words for hatred, one for hate in the way that I both love and hate people, and one for pure intense hatred, or as I define it, a complete and thorough lack of love. Because in everyone there is something I absolutely can't stand about them, and I would go as far as to say that I hated it, except that I don't want that to be confused with the other type. I used to think of hatred as being willing to give your life to take their freedom. But that's not quite true. For example, I would give my life to take various terrorists' freedom, but I do not hate them. Because this kind of hatred is a void, a black hole, if you will. I do not hate them because I understand them, and part of me pities them. I do not hate anyone in this way.   If you knew there would be a nuclear war in one week, what would you do?   Have a hell of a good time.  I wish I could say I would try to stop it, since I have nothing to lose, but I'm not that altruistic. I think that truthfully, I would either join the masses in their hopeless franticism (word?) trying to fufill their every desire and then commit suicide the day prior to, or keep a level head and try to seek shelter deep underground, and see if I could survive.   If you knew you could devote yourself to any single occupation--music, writing, acting, business, politics, medicine, etc.--and be among the best and most successful in the world at it, what would you choose? If you knew you had only a 10 percent chance of being so successful, would you still put in the effort?  I  don't know...I can't see me sticking with one job for very long...I'd get bored to death...maybe something equestrian...I'd love to ride hunter/jumper...Giving your best effort is not just to become successful. I would surely give it my all.  I cannot say. I have absolutely no idea of what I would like to do with my life. I feel like I am not good enough at anything to base my life upon it. But if I found something I wanted that badly to do, I would put forth all of the effort I had.   Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be?   My books...or maybe my CD's and CD player...my computer, my sketchpad, my drawing pencils, everything!!! *sob*  I'm not very fond of material items. There isn't much I couldn't live without. But I'd probably head towards my books.   When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?   I'm singing to myself now, and I sing to other people all the time, but they rarely listen.  Oh, I'm usually singing to myself. I don't really sing to other people...I kind of sing at them, though. They don't realise I'm doing it.   If you could choose the manner of your death, what would it be?   Anyone who does not know that I want to die of spontaneous human combustion is a complete idiot.  Yeah, I'd still go for spontaneous human combustion. Or suicide. I don't think I really believe in anything strongly enough to die for it.   Do you have any specific long-term goals? What is one, and how do you plan to reach it?   I tend to set my goals small and achievable. Right now, I really want to take riding lessons. (On horses, silly) Definately hunter/jumper and probably dressage...and I also would like to have something I wrote published. How cool would that be?  Perhaps this is kind of lame, but I feel very excited that I actually reached the goal I set for myself in sixth grade. Though I can only ride when I can scrounge up twenty bucks from my non-existant income, at least I get to. And I'm going to do a combined test at a show in September. (That's dressage and some jumping, just short crossrails.) I guess I don't really have any long term goals. I'm kind of wishy-washy. I'd still love to be a published author. It seems like that would finally give me a sense of accomplishment. But that's not very likely to happen.   For what in your life do you feel most grateful?   My friends.  My friends, still, for they help me figure out who I am.   If you could have free, unlimited service for five years from an extremely good cook, chauffeur, housekeeper, masseuse, or personal secretary, which would you choose?   I don't need a cook, cuz I hate eating. A chauffeur would be useless because I can get my drivers permit in just over a year. I don't need a house keeper cuz it would be a waste of time for both of us. And what would I need with a personal secretary? I'm 12, for heaven's sake. Masseusse would be good. Very good.  Cook? Naw, I still don't like eating. Not to say I won't. Because I do eat. I just don't need someone to cook for me. Chauffer? Not once I can drive. Housekeeper? No, I can do my own cleaning, thanks. Masseuse? Mmmm...massage...but I don't want some random person on call to rub my muscles... Personal secretary? No, I handle my own stuff. I guess I'd rather be self supported. I don't want any of these things.   Would you enjoy spending a month of solitude in a beautiful natural setting? Food and shelter would be provided, but you wouldn't see another person.   OH YEAH!!!! Talk about heaven on earth!  This sounds like paradise. I don't think I'd miss people, even. I'm too fond of solitude.   Would you like to be famous? In what way?   Maybe, for writing a truly awesome book, or doing something great with horses.  I guess I'd like to be known, but not famous, if that makes any sense.   Which of the following restrictions could you best tolerate: leaving the country permanently, or never leaving the state in which you now live?   I wouldn't mind leaving the country...I've always wanted to live in Great Britain. Staying here forever would be awful, tho.  I would rather leave the country permanently. That actually doesn't sound bad.   Is there anything you've dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it?   Riding lessons. I think I've made it clear that I can't afford them...feel free to donate. ;)  Can't think.   What are your most compulsive habits?   Don't get me started...  I turn of the lights every time I leave my room, I always flush the toilet, oh, wait, that's not quite what they meant, is it? Checking my e-mail, I think. And using metaphors instead of saying things straight out. Using semicolons.   What do you most strive for in your life: accomplishment, security, power, love, excitement, knowledge, or something else?   Accomplishing secure, powerful, loving, exciting, knowledgable something.  What do I strive for? Perfection.   You are invited to a party that will be attended to many fascinating people you've never met. Would you want to go if you had to go by yourself?   Sure would, and I'd have a whoppin' good time.  Yes. I'm not fond of parties, but I would still go. I'd be more inclined to go alone than with another.   Since adolescence, in what three-year period do you feel you experienced the most personal growth and change?   The last three years.  I think the last year has had more change in it than any other three-year span combined.   If you were happily married and then met someone you felt certain to bring you passionate, intoxicating love, would you leave you spouse? What if you had kids?   I would never leave my spouse. Fidelity (sp?) is very important to me.  I do not desire passion or intoxication. I would not leave a spouse I loved. I would not trade security, love, and thoughtful conversation for passion.   Who is the most important person in your life?   Can't pick just one.  I'm not inclined to say.   Do you support capital punishment?   YEAH BABY!!!!!!!!!!! wh00t!!!  Ahh, keep in mind I was joking. I do not. Death is kind.   If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?   I'd have my parents give me more freedom, and make them LISTEN and I'd want them to understand and not tease me.  I desire more freedom. I now know I don't need understanding from my parents; I can get it from others.   If 100 people your age were chosen at random, how many do you think you'd find leading a more satisfying life than yours?   I think it's impossible to rate how satisfying one's life is. What can you compare it to?  Satisfaction? It is what you make it to be.   Someone you love deeply is brutally murdered. You know the identity of the murderer, who is acquitted. Would you seek revenge?   Sure would. If I loved them, I would do anything to avenge their death. I would kill the murderer, and I wouldn't get caught. In every great detective's mind, there is another powerful side, a criminal side, that must be locked away. I would unlock this side.  I think I was on something when I wrote that. If I knew the murderer's identity for certain, s/he would not be acquitted. If there was a reasonable doubt in anyone's mind that it was not her/him, than that reasonable doubt would be in my mind, as well.   What do you value most in a relationship?   Understanding, trust, pure sweet love.  Love, understanding, and trust are still at the top of my list. I do not care if we disagree, as long as we can see each others' sides.   Do you judge others by higher or lower standards than you judge yourself?   Lower standards.  Lower standards, though the closer they are to me, the harder I judge them.   If there were a public execution on television, would you watch it?   No way...unless they were getting their head chopped off...:P  No.   What things are too personal to discuss with others?   Things that I won't list here.  I think if I found someone I could really talk to, and completely trust, there would be nothing. But generally, I hide quite a bit from people.   Would you be willing to do something very unsatisfying (e.g., clean toilets) for the next five years if you were certain that the experience would afterwards bring you a deep sense of personal fulfillment for the rest of you life?   Sure would.  Certainly. What I do matters little compared to what I think.   How many times during the day do you look at yourself in the mirror?   Never on purpose, unless I'm dressing up for something and have to fix my hair.  Before I leave the house, or on random occasions when I just stare and wonder.   Would you prefer to be blind or deaf?   Blind. My hearing is important to me, and I just don't care about sight.  Blind. I do care about sight. I love beauty. It's hard for me to say just why, really, but I'd rather be blind.   What does it take for you to trust people?   I fully trust only one, and I trust her because of many things I don't care to say here.  My trust in her is greater than most, but is not complete. I trust no one. I cannot.   Of all the people close to you, whose death would you find most disturbing?   One of my friends  One of my friends, I suppose.
