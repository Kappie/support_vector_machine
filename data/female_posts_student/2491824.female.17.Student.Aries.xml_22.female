There is just something about it--the way it makes me feel-- that I just can't describe.  No matter what the dream is about-- no matter if it is terrifing or blissful-- my dreams just make me feel so... good.  I don't know if there is a word for the feeling. I wish there was so I could explain.   I want to go to sleep now so I can dream...  (P.S.-- I'm looking at new templates for this, and might even try to make my own because I've found some awesome drawings-- urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one -- that I just adore at  urlLink explodingdog . Yay!)
