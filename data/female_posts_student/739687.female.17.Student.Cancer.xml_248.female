I'm certainly no exception, and certainly not complaining. I like change. I think people have every right to do whatever they want with their lives. Change can be a beautiful thing. I'm confused. About alot of things. I don't know what I want...or what I'm supposed to want. I am torn in a million different directions. I keep saying I'm going to just run with things, and just take risks and chances...but I don't. I feel kind of like I'm falling behind in many different ways. I don't feel horridly depressed. I feel sad. I feel a little down. I'm just kind of stuck. I'm sitting at a crossroad with a million different paths, and I couldn't begin to know which way to turn. There is no continuing where I'm heading, because I've already forgotten where I came from. Everyone else is moving along. Why can't I? It's hard to smile. Impossible not to sigh. But I'm not complaining, as long as I don't sit idle for too long. I just want to move on.  Ahhh, on a lighter note...omg Amanda I so want to put a certain something in here, but umm...I wouldn't want to come off as so much of a huge bitch as someone else. Hahahahaha, jesus, so great.  I feel tired. And sick. And sad. But I'll get over it all. Definately the first 2...hopefully the third as soon as possible. It's typical.  Have fun, crazies. Later.
