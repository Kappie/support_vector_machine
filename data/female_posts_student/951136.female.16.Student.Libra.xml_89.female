" hey emo girl"  i was like. WHAT?!...me. your joking?... and he walked back and said i always see you around but i have no idea what your name is? and i've always wanted to tell you that i think you are so pretty! i'm chris King.  and like a nerd i said, i know. i've seen your around for two years!  but anyway, it made me smile. he made my day. a little something to prove there are some nice ppl in the world.  let's see....bought a dress for homecoming for $12. heh, i was quite excited. but who says i'm going.  i actually really want to go, but without a date. it would be so much better if we could all just go together and dance. no dates. thats the good stuff. I hated this year's.  all i've been doing for the past week is watching dave matthews video's. Storytellers, woodstock, all these random song clips...sigh. good stuff. obviously i have nothign else to say... goodbye
