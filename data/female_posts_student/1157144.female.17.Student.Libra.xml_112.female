As you have mentioned previously, you have The Drama Crew and I have...  Cortland, John, and...  *sighs* Dawson's Creek...  Don't ask!  Oh, by the way!  VAL, you are right.  A synagauge is hebrew for temple.  So, therefore, Val (I think) is right  Maggie: Um, not to be rude and not to pry, but why Vegas?  The last time I went to Vegas was for my Grandparents wedding and man was that fun!  But, then again, I was only nine!  The whole time I played video games with my cousin.  And seeing that you are older, can't drink, can't go to strip clubs, and many other things I really hope that you find some fun to do.  It shouldn't be that hard with a stinky-booger-daughter-of-a-hoe!  Jason: That sucks about you being a chaffeur, I don't feel your pain because you can't drive, but honestly:  SUCK IT UP!  IS IT SO BAD THAT YOU HAVE TO BE NICE TO YOUR BROTHER OR YOUR FREAKIN' FRIENDS FOR THAT MATTER?  I just wanted to open that wound as a representative of the NERLC!  HE HE HE!  LONG LIVE THE NERLC
