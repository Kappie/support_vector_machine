One time a couple years ago olive and I got into a fight [hahhaa. cat fight!!!!] and he scratched me and made me bleed a bit on my arm but it wasn't that big of a deal so I didn't report the occurence to the auhorities. [aka, my mum]  Later that day my mom took a look at my arm and was like "ARE YOU CUTTING YOURSELF?!" uh...No. Calm down.  But the reason that was the title of my post was becuase I tried on  my 80s outfit and it makes me look...uh...like a teenage mother?  See for yourself... do you think I look as...weird..as I think I look?    Oh well...all for theatres sake!!  So today I cleaned and it took so long, I thought I was going to die. But I didn't. I have to clean out all the windows and I opened our bathroom window and I was about to clean it but, to my disgust, I saw 5 dead hosue flys in it!!!!! It was SO sick. I am like really scared of bugs! Haha. so I paid my mom 2 dollars to throw them away. Hahaha.  Then I got hungry and when I am hungry I COOOK! So I made 2 yummy key lime pies. I ate two pieces already! tasty.  But now I am starting to feel sick. Whenever I eat citrus it upsets my stomach. One time I ate 3 glasses of pink lemonade and about an hour later I threw up pink all over our white carpet. Haha [TMI!! TMI!!]  My mom says I have almost thrown up in as many places as her. Her most famous..uh..release of stomach contents was on a taxi cab in rome. Mine was at a civil war museum on all the pricless antiques.  Wow, I am going to stop now. Hahhaha.  Anywho.  Well, I guess those coments kinda ended my whole posting mood...adios!!  Laura
