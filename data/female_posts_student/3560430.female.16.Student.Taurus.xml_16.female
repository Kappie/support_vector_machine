I think he's pissed at me too but I don't know. Guys in general aren't that big on the whole communication thing... Except for my dad he generally is. But really most males (at least in my school) aren't into talking about it. I told them to leave it be, he'll get over it and if not apologize and tell him that there is not much more you can do. I just hope I didn't do the wrong thing maybe I did maybe not. Who knows. I'm just glad I could type it out, it helps me organize my thoughts better.   Apparently this girl I know who's math mark is like 55% just got 90% on the final, I hope I can do nearly as well. I'm going to study my ass off for it. There are no two ways about it I'm determined to get at least a B.   I'm doing work expeiriance next week at a woman's shelter, poor Mr Arthure was nearly panicked when I told him I might take transit.I really hope that my dad can drive me the first couple of times. I can't afford transit.
