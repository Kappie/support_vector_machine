Gus and Wish are up and moving around, I wish it wasn't raining out so I could let them play in the grass.       This whole thing with Ashley is getting really frustrating. I don't know how many times I have to stay that I'll be someone's friend, and for them to not listen. I have done what I could to be there for her, I guess it's just up to her how she wants to treat me.      Anywho, still no smoking today, and my chest feels somewhat better. I can't smoke, there was a reason I quit, and I'm going to do it again.  Yay for me. *pats myself on the back.*      Shower time. I hope everyone has a good day.    Feeling: Listening to:
