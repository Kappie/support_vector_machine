Drama Drama Drama Look what life's become Poofs and Hobbits and Squishys God this is so dumb Why can't life be happy Why can't we all have fun Why isn't my life normal What have I done All I want is boardom All I need is friends All I ever get is drama It's a train wreck that never ends I don't need more tears more games, more fears I don't need more drama I'm done
