Yes, I do get a comfy leather armchair to sit in while I'm there, but that doesn't make up for the four hours that I spend sitting in a room, with a port stuck in my hand to get my infusion. Yesterday, I was the only one in the room, but usually there's someone else in there too. I have a lovely bruise on my hand from where the needle went in. My veins are so weak from years of steroid eyedrops (no, not illegal drugs!) that vessels pop the second the needle goes in. Then the medicine doesn't help, it's clear, and sort of feels cold as it goes through my vein. Then they take the needle out, and leave a little hole in my hand for the medicine to be fed through. I put on my headphones before it started, only to find that my batteries had died, and my mother refused to buy more. So when I got home, I switched batteries with my camera, which worked fairly well.
