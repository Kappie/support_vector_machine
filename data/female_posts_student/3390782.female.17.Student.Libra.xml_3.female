I have a lot of difficulty opening up to people, but when I finally do open up to someone, they force me to no longer speak to them again. That sucks so much!! I feel like I lost my best friend! I can't bring myself to gain the courage that I need to stand up for myself and those that I care about, so I am forever a coward. That's all I am. I will do just about anything to get attention and recognition from others, but then I hide from everything. I'M SICK OF HIDING!!! I just want to crawl out from under this rock of fear and take a stand. I want a lot of things. I want my family to lay off of me. I want my friends to be happy. I want Ty and Jy to get laid, (Not with each other!!). I want to be happy. I also want this wicked heartagram lunchbox I saw at Hot Topic for $20, but seriously, I am sick and tired of doing what everyone tells me to do. For once I want to do what I want. I just want one thing in this world; HAPPINESS. I'll never get it. Happiness is a sharp razor and a willing vein away.
