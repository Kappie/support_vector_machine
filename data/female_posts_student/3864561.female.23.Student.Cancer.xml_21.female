My logic is that whenever I have it done "properly" I'm invariably unhappy with it and end up re-doing it myself a few days later, so this way I'm cutting out the middle man, so to speak, and saving money.  Also, over the last year I've changed my hair colour about five times (from my natural auburn to blonde, light brown, dark brown, red, and back to something approximating my "real" colour) with varying degrees of success and now consider myself to be something of an expert.  So, in preparation for my forthcoming holiday, I've spent the last hour cutting my hair with the aid of two mirrors (one stacked on an extremely shaky 5ft high pile of furniture) and a pair of "proper" hair-cutting scissors that I've had for about 10 years and have, frankly, seen better days. Now it's still wet (a moral objection to hairdryers that I'll go into some other time) and I've cut off about three times as much as I intended, but it does actually seem to look OK. Of course I'll fiddle with it again later and undo my good work, but for the moment I am proclaiming it to be a minor success.
