Reading through them made me a little irritated with myself for not writing more often, especially this past week or two.  I guess I'll try to sum it all up now.  Yesterday marked the one week anniversary of owning Razz, my new cat.  She was adopted to help fill the hole of my deceased, beloved cat Sammy, who died about two weeks ago.  She was the best cat I could ever have, I've had her since I was about 3 or 4.  It was really difficult to let her go, her death was so sudden that I wasn't able to control my feelings.  I guess it's better that I waited to write.  Oscar is lonely without Sam, and is craving attention.  He's slowly warming up to the new invader, I wish the dogs would warm up just as fast.  They scared the shit out of her the other day when trying to introduce them, now she's ended up with URI, or upper respiratory infection (almost like a cat cold), and refuses to eat.  She sneezes all night and you can hear the mucus bubbles inside her throat while she tries to breathe, yet the doctors say she'll be fine in a week or two.  Poor kitty.  She's slowly warming up to her new environments, and now she doesn't hide under the bed every time someone walks into the room.  So she's improving.  One of my fishes also died.  Two death's in one weekend, oh well, didn't like the fish much anyway.  Battlefield Vietnam came out the other day.  I don't like it as much as I was hoping I would, but I just need to get used to flying helicopters and the M60's.  While I was playing today, my sister came in the room and turned on the lights, then started fucking around opening desk drawers and shit like that, and the light created an annoying glare against the computer screen, so I asked her to go somewhere else.  She refused, so when she left and came in a second time, I asked her to fucking go somewhere else.  So instead of saying no, or just being a little mature and actually leaving to the kitchen or what not, she screams as loud as she fucking can in my ear and throws a pair of sunglasses at me.  Thus proving the fact that she is the sole reason I have poor hearing, headaches usually only on the weekends, and gives me even more reason to hate her.  I should have broken her nose when she leaned over to scream in my ear, oh well, maybe next time.  I've had headaches all weekend.  She didn't make them any better.  No wonder her (ex)roommate in college hated her.  She's impossible to get along with.
