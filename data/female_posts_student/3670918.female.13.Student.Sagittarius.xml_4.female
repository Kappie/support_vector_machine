Tomorrow my sister is playing at this thing called the battle of the bands tomorrow night and I am so excited. I hope I will see someone I know (yeah right). The only bad thing about vacation is that the guy I've had the worst crush on all year is going to high school next year and IM never going to see him again. A good thing is that I also have a crush on this other guy too and he is in the same grade that IM in and I danced with him. I think hex total in to me. I just hope he asks me out next year. (he) like that wile ever happen. IM going through such a face Wright IM BOY CRAZY. Well my brain is about to explode from all this thinking. My little brain cant take all of this thinking. Well this is the end of my very sad story I bet when your done reading this you will be crying so bad. Goodbye.
