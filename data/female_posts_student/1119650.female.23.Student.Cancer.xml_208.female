No more  urlLink "sex strikes"  for me...thats just plain silly!  So sure, none of you needed to a) think of me having sex with someone or b) hear the sordid, intimate details of my life, but its not like I told you I had anal sex with a  urlLink Penguin  or something!  Anyhow here's my recap for the rest of the weekend: Friday night I ate dinner at  urlLink Chevy's  and had some BITCHIN' mexican food and some yummy strawberry 'ritas as well.  Then I made the sex and that was also quite yay.  I also watched some movies and started playing the new Zelda game for GameCube.  Saturday I slept most of the day and then I woke up, went to eat at Steak  Ale where I had some serious steaks and lobster tails (no, its not even close to Ruth's Chris yummy goodness, but still...  urlLink I  ).  Then I went to the village to some bars and for some groovy shopping and it rawked.  Finally I came home and made  more  sex and watched Lord of The Rings again and it was joyful.  Sunday was quite sexless, but thats a-ok.  My chach needed a rest after all that.  I got a manicure with my mommy and then we headed out to  urlLink IKEA  to shoppe (remember the rule..."pe" makes it foreign...so does adding "Ye Olde") for some sweedish furniture.  It was also very yay!  Diva's daily mood:  urlLink HaPpY!
