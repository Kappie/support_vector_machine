"hi, is mike home?"-jenelle "no, sorry he went to gavin's house. a whole bunch of them went and took their guitars."-mike's mom. "oh ok. thank you."-everyone at the same time. "can i tell him who was calling?"-mike's mom. "uh...kate."-jenelle "haha sure, you girls always pick on kate."-mike's mom.  she's awesome. yeah.  so after we went to mike's, we walked to gavin's house... and on the way, we stopped at jenelle's cuz i had to pee. and then she stayed at home, and we continued our journey to gavin's house. t'was fun. and then when we got to gavin's house, we couldn't work up the courage to go to his door. haha cuz you know... he's so intimidating. haha not. and yeah, we were standing outside his house for like 10 minutes, and then we didn't go to his door aha. "woor".  so after deciding not to call on gavin after all of that, we started walking back to vanessa's house. and we were walking along her street, and these 2 cars pulled up. (a van and a sedan.) and this guy in the van was like "hey ladies... what's up?" (hitting on us. yeah, fun.) and the guy in the sedan was like "oh hey ladies..." and then they drove away. but i looked at the guy in the sedan, and who was it?!  scott effing fischer.  i was like crying cuz i was so  happy. i mean wow... so hot. (scott fischer=grade 12 guy. my dream.)  so after crying tears of joy, we finally got to vanessa's house. then erblina went home, and then i went home shortly after. t'was some good times right thurr.   in the depths of shadows, lingers my love for you.  says: what do guys talk about? aha tell me truthfully.  in the depths of shadows, lingers my love for you.  says: it's a secret no girls know.
