OHH MY GOODNESS!! yesterday was probly one of the BEST days i've had in soo long!! first of all i know this is a horrible thing to say but.. i kind of like all the flooding and what not just because sugar land is such a bubble.. nothing bad ever happens here so when something big does happen, even if it's flooding, it is exciting. however i am soo sorry to everyone who had bad luck with the rain yesterday. ga.. i love you even if your engine was flooded :) but anyways.. i went over to melissas and we had soo much fun!! i have forgotten how much fun playing in the rain is!! sometimes i wish i could go back to my younger years..  hmm im not sure what else to say. i think im finally getting better at chem. yesterday i got back the highest test grade i've ever gotten in there all year.. very exciting!! ohh and terrance got to shoot off a cannon at the football game we went to saturday night!! lol it was really fun  only 37 days until christmas!! can you believe it?? omg this year is going by so fast!! and im excited that it's finally getting cold!!  alright well i need to start on my homework for tonight. but im in such a good mood that i would love for someone to call me!! call the cell tho.. my mom is going to call tonight and i want the line to stay open. 281.785.2049 alright by guys!!  jess
