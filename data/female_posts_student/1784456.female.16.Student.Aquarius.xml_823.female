We bought Hagen Das *whatever* well, actually two lots and I'm sooo full! I also cooked this pizza, and it came out burnt but the cheese still wasn't cooked! Aargh! I'm trying to finish off Izzy's miniture golf game, she's got 38 on this hole with a par of 4 and I can't do it! Ah, might as well round it up to a nice number like... say.... 50? Hehe, Izzy is +43 up! Wow, I actually putted it! Hehe... I gave up, I got stuck with Izzy's ball again, I think it's hoaxed! Or maybe the smell waves coming off it make it too big to go in the hole! Heee! Aren't I clever? Mmm... now for taking over the world, I'm really gonna have to do that some day.
