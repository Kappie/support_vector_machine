First of all, thanx to my best friend 'cause she's about the only person that understands that particular situation from the previous post. While I'm sitting here debating what I want to do when school starts this fall (I have several options available to me), feeling down about the person I love most kinda being taken away from me (although I'm sure we'll always be friends and we may talk from time to time, it's only a matter  of time before that ends too) I get this letter from David. Who is David? I will tell you in just a second. Someone told my best friend ('cause she has a situation with her ex) something that I can really take to heart with my situation. Something they said to her just really struck me as good advice. "Dont marry the person you can live with, marry the person you cant live without." So on to the rest, David writes me and says that he and Jill are breaking up, and that he wants to come see me when he comes home. At this point and time, I'm single, not even talking to anybody seriously (while i am talking to a couple ppl, they arent serious, so I'm not going to pretend that they are) so I'm like, yeah. Made him an offer he cant refuse. He doesnt have to be my boyfriend, just my steady piece of a** and he can come and go as he pleases. I'm sure he wont want to stray far 'cause I've never had a boyfriend cheat on me and I'm awesome to date. Then I got these guys that think they are such hot shit trying to talk to me and they are just pathetic. I dont really date chatters, but there have been a few that I've been really infatuated with or liked, crushed on, or I like now. And since I spill the rest of my guts here, I might as well make it known. I used to have a crush on Brandon (irish_man somethin or other) and I used to like Gergy- but um, he lost cool points with me a long time ago. I have the major hots for Cooper, who has been kinda out of the picture for a long time, so I got over it. I did like this Timmay guy but then he let me know that what happens in chat (for him) stays in chat so I let it go. Let us not forget Mr. Jim, who did the ultimate hump-and-dump (even though we never even discussed dating or even sleeping together so him cramming his tongue down my throat was kinda traumatizing) and yes, that would be fishin_fool for those of you that do know. But now, I'm wondering how wrong is it for me to lusta man old enough to be my dad? *shrugs* beats me. I had a crush on D, aka shyguy_ak, but um, the more I get to know him, the more my crush floats away. It gets irritating when guys, instead of saying, I dont want to date YOU say, "I dont date chatters." or "I dont like to date my friends," in the case of Peter. *shakes her head* pete, pete, pete.... blah, blah, blah. Let us not forget that I crushed on S8N, but he did the same thing... "you live too far away" and then started seeing someone farther away from him than I am. What's funny about this all? I dont even seriously look at chatters as potential boyfriends- not ever. Unless they actually try to make an effort to see me or something, it's not happenin. Let us not forget the only two girls I've ever had any kind of crushes on, but once again I know it will never happen... Alyssa (pixxxie) and Tab. Yes yes yes, I know that this is probably a bad idea, but hey, why not tell it all if i'm tellin. I did like Kyle too- he's a newbie to me, but he's cute. It's not that I dont like him anymore, I just am realistic; if I cant have em, why dwell on em, right? I do like Mr. Travis too, but like the rest, it's something that will never happen unless some magic fairy comes along and douses me with magic dust or some shit. And then there is the just-like-a-movie-star likes, such as: e_dev eric, and any other extremely hot guy from chat that I've crushed on. The silly thing? Why is it that guys always wanna go for some really hot chick, or pretty much any other chat chick- except for me, and then they wanna know why I'm such a man-basher, why I refuse to date chatters. I am not going to bash the whole male poulation... I know that not all of them are bad, but if I cant even get my exes to bad mouth me, what makes these guys think I'm so horrible. I'm not most girls, as my ex told me yesterday. But apparently there is some tragic flaw about me that I cannot fix. I dont care anymore. After dealing with an asshole like Jay, all u guys can go suck a dick if you dont like me. I could give a shit less. All this sweet talkin to get in my bed? You are soooo wasting your breath and it is soooo pathetic. Like I've said before, and I will say it again, I know what I'm worth and I know that I'm an awesome person- I get told at least once every day. So when you think that you're in there, and that you have me right where you want me? Think again. I've had the live-in boyfriend once and only once. The only reason why he stuck around as long as he did is because he honest-to-goodness loved me. I'm not talking about saying it without action. He LOVED me. He tried to do everything he could for me- I was the one working full time, he was taking care of home for me. I'm talking back massages, foot rubs, telling me all the time he loved me. If he had been the type, I would have gotten love letters from him too. I know what a real man is like too, so dont think you're fooling me. I didnt mean to turn this into a man bashing, but you guys just make me sick. When I like somebody, they have to act like I'm sooooo horrible that they would never have anything to do with me- especially in front of others, then wanna talk to me on the sneak and try to get sex from me. And for you wierdos thinkin that I'm just gonna meet you sight-unseen and sleep with you? YOU HAVE A MENTAL DYSFUNCTION THAT I CANNOT SEEM TO GET THROUGH.... Since when do you think it is couth to ask a woman if you can fuck on the first date? Or to think that talking about sex constantly is sexy? It isnt. Keep your day job and learn how to be a gentleman, fellas.
