I was reading Seventeen, all about hot guys and "Mya's Hot and You Could Be Too, If You Got Off Your Fat Ass!" and "Teen Sex Scandals: Three Hours of Labor In The Back Of An F-150". And other such nonsense! It was ASS-BAD! Hoo-ah! And there was an I-Zone sticky film advertisement where there were some awesome stickers for samples, one of which was "...in bed"...and that's it. I was going to honour my beloved fortune cookies and the Chinese culture in such a manner, but the adhesive wore out really fast and fell off while I was recording.  Hey, I recorded a song yesterday with the word "hoo-ah" in it. It was ass-bad.  LINDS, if you haven't all ready, don't tell Abby the "other surprise", I'm still gonna do it, I guess. And if you did, o well, it's cool.   I am SO TIRED all, I haven't been this wasted since...well, I've never been this wasted, I guess. ARGH!  Abby was at school today, YE-AH! That completely made my day to the fullest. And we saw Trav-o and Romeo tried to scare me but I yelped at him and he shied away, and I had a screamed conversation with Stephen Jones across the lobby, to the stares of some very scared froshies. And Mr. Kimmel came and shook mine and Abby's hands, it was so cool/weird. I saw him coming and I said, "Akk, I'm busted." But then he asked my name and hers and if I went to the school, I said yes, he asked how it was going and I lied, "Great," and he walked away with well-wishes. Aw w00t. P\/\/|\|3|).  I need to go record afore the sun goes down, friends. And if my secret calculations are correct, this shall be the last night of recording, as I have hit the mighty    EIGHT    mark, and that's enough for free pro studio time, w00t. I need to teach Alex all the songs tho. Downer. I'm going to try and lure him with beer, pr0n, and Mary J tho, so maybe he'll learn faster...thanks to A. Non E. Moose for this wonderful trick, heheheh.  And I'll have CDs (with cases, finally!) to give to all once I remaster and get a copy I like down pat. I LOVE IT AND I THINK IT'S GRAND. Some songs are like "whoa", other songs are like, "umm...you should really take some anti-depressants", and most are like, "this sucks". But the choices are up to you!  Until we meet again, here's lookin' at you, kids.
