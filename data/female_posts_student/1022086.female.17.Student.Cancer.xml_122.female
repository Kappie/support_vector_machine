We've finally come around to buying the paint to paint my room (the original idea was to do it last year), so I've been painting. My mother has been the other party in the process, and my sister helped for five minutes and then scoowampled out of the deal, the sucker.   Anyway, it's been pretty fun. We've got one more coat to go, and that will be applied tomorrow morning. The primer took a good 6-7 hours to apply yesterday, and the room actually looked good simply after that application (because the blue we're painting is rather deep, we needed a primer that was 50% the actual colour-- in our case, a pretty, lively smurf blue). The first coat of the actual planetarium blue isn't very nice, but hopefully once it dries better and the second coat, which will be easier to  handle, will be over it, it will look good.   I'm generally giving my room a gradual makeover, me thinks, and the room's excited.    I tried to talk my mom into utilizing the storage room besides the garage to build a laboratory, but she doesn't like the idea. It was originally supposed to be an art studio, but Alessandra is moving out for good, I think, so it'd be useless to convert it to an actual art studio at this point. I really did want a lab, but my mom believes I'd blow up the house, for some odd reason. Eh. I guess I'll have to wait until I own my own home to build me a laboratory. It will be fun-- I can invite friends over to play!  Anyway, SAT: Decent Score Attempt Mission #2 is Saturday. I haven't studied a single bit, and I just realized that I don't have a graphing calculator anymore as I'm no longer in Calculus thanks to summer vacation (yay for Christmas/barfday gifts, even if they don't help me much right this very now), so I've already got bad feelings about it. *Sigh* I hate this stupid test. It's but a test over how well or badly one can take the darned thing, and I just happen to be a decent but not great SAT taker. I may be in advanced mathematics courses of all sorts and have a fairly good vocabulary, but I'm just not good at taking this test. Although my first score wasn't very great, it was almost decent and good enough to get me into both Tech and Mercer, I do believe. My issue and focus currently is obtaining scholarships. Hopefully, I'll still be okay if I don't do well on the SAT again. I have nearly everything else scholarship donors like to aid me, so maybe they'll like me anyway! Eh... They say it's very rare for SAT scores to jump dramatically from one try to another, but I guess I really haven't much of a choice but to give it a shot.   If you pray and if you love me, you know what to do. ^.^  Anyhow, my next rant includes how much I want to leave the country and graduate. Italy paperwork is still undergoing processes at the Consulate, but hopefully I'll still be able to get some decent amount of time in vacation *super-knock on wood*. Otherwise, I can't believe there's a year of high school left. UGHH.   Well, wow, I came, I typed, I ranted.  Oh, yeah, I really need to get crap done this month. Adios for now!
