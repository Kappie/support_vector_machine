Then some old...stuff came up and I felt like I was being stabbed with a knife. I wish I had someone to talk to. Someone who would understand it all without getting angry or anything. Its just that one subject...no matter what...Someone always gets mad at me. Why can't they see my side of this? Can't they understand that this stuff hurts me? *Sigh* If only I did have someone...a real best friend to talk this all through with...but I don't.  They have all fell for this little spell I guess only I can see through. Maybe because it hurts me...and yeah. I know once someone reads this they are gonna know what im talking about and get pissed. Eh I can't even talk to this measly piece of shit. It listens....but others read....and there goes it all. If only for a few minutes I could share my side of the story for once. Once someone listens to me without getting angry...or talking back. If only they could listen. But I know...I have no one to do that with. I can't even trust my own mother anymore. I used to tell her stuff like this...but she even turned on me...That was proved a few months ago...where once again...I lost a friend.  *sigh* Life sucks doesn't it? I guess I could always just keep it all inside...But...*Sigh* I dunno anymore...If I tell someone....sooner or later...it'll come around and stab me in the back....I know this...because its happend many times before.....MANY. So yeah. I guess I've let all emotion out. Please...don't get mad at me...Thats all I ask. I just needed to let this out and I did...*sigh*  Im sorry for all that Ive done...I should have never wrote this in the first place...im such a bad person...*Sigh* If only I was better....if only.....  -Tara
