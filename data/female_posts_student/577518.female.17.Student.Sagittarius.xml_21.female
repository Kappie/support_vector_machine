But then I have my tuition on 12.30, so I couldn't go to the AGM. Then she told me she didn't want to go too, because if she join the club, she need to join those members to plant the flowers in school, she said she hate it. You should see the way she said : I hate it the most. You would feel like want to give her a punch.   Hmm, so she hates nature. I always think that if someone hates nature, they don't deserve to live on this Earth.  They breathe the air and they step on the ground, then they hate the nature?
