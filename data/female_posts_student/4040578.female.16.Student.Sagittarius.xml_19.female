That has got to be one of my favorite sauces next to the delicious tasting steak sauce and chipotlè sauce.  I put those sauces on everything.  I know I said I am on a very strict eating habit now, but I was asked out to lunch today and Taco Bell was the place of choice. Eating out was nice. I was asked by an old classmate of mine at the not so lovely Eagledale. So today was a happy day, thanks to Taco Bell!      Moving on, I was awaken at 11:00 am by the phone ringing in my ear. Sheesh, I always think the phone is ringing in a dream until it keeps going on and on. Yes, the phone call was for me for my lunch date.  I made plans to leave by 12:30. After I got off the phone, I made my way into the restroom to take my shower and then get ready for my outting.  As I was in the process of that I got online to see if anyone was on. I got an IM from good ol' Jeremiah saying he doesn't have his surgery, CONGRATULATIONS....for now. After that lil chit chat, I finished getting ready and before ya know it I was on my way to eat one of my favoritest meals ever.  As I have said previously, it was great. Then I was brought home around 2-ish. I waited and waited for Leah to get off the pc but she didn't so I fell asleep waiting for her. Then I woke up and watched Roswell.  I was asked by my dad to go to the Indians game tonight, but I refused cause it's icky sticky hot. So Leah and him just went. I did go over to Big Lots with my mom to get a trash can and then we went driving. We drove to see one of my mom's many old houses off of Kessler. We also cruised around some other gorgeous houses. If I don't get to move to the country, I am moving into one of the ones I saw. Driving we did see some heavy trash pick-up stuff that had these old windows in them. Mom wanted me to put them in the trunk so she could hang them on the cottage since she loves that country,rustic look. So I did as she asked. I like digging through peoples trash, as long as they have some good stuff...hehe. After that we drove back home. I watched like one and half Lifetime movies. They were good. But then, you know what? Time for Big Bro. Sorry, Jeremiah, I like the show. But I am strong enough not to lower myself into being like them. Just because I watch it, doesn't mean I agree with it. Well, I watched that and then it ended which leaves me to sitting here.      Ok, I don't think I have much more to comment on. But as I am sitting here at my desk, I see some origami (sp?). Leah has been practicing and she left her mess in my room, sheesh. Looks like Miss Brè has some cleaning to do, again. Well, I am hot so I need to cool down with the fan blowing on me, so I am outtie!      Music Playin' in The Background:  Passenger Seat- Stephen Speaks
