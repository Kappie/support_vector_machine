Yes, I have frolicked in the snow, but I'm still really excited and hyper! Woohooo! And yes, I have walked through it until I got caked. Nothing can stop my hyper happeeeness! Ahh well some things will... but I won't let them happen! (Everyone has to not say anything now!) I loooove snow though... I wonder where this obsession came from? Oh god, not another obsession! Also I'm becoming obsessed with polar bears although I think that has something to do with giving up chocolates and sweets for lent. That big shock to my system has to have affected it a lot! I keep forgetting as well and going to eat chocolate, it hasn't reached my conscious yet but then some things never do. Ahh well guess I'll have to wait another ten years for it to snow again. Might as well go roll around in it.
