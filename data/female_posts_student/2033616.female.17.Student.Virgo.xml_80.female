But I'm beginning to realize that they don't do it b/c they are trying to hide anything, but rather to not hurt me.  That's what a friend will never do, intentionally hurt you.  How can I be upset about that?  I'm taking a more positive perspective of the situation now.  Why let petty things outweigh all the great things?  I just need to learn to trust the right people.  Now, in case you're reading this and you're not Laura McCarty, i can assure you, you haven't the slightest idea of what i am referring to... Maybe Laura does... If she thinks hard enough ;-)  The current countdown to youth rally is at 11 days... I am sooo excited.  It's going to rock.  The song Alyssa and I are singing is going to be great (i just need to memorize the words!!!) and the pictures for the accompanying slide show just need to be put together.  OOOO i love Rally.. if anyone is actually going to Spinsters... I feel very sorry for you, b/c that means you will not be there and you will be missing the most fun one can EVER have in Pierre, South Dakota.  I will stop taunting you now.  I've had a wonderful time procrastinating with you, but I really must do something productive now.  Lizard Breath
