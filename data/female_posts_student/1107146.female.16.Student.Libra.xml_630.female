And I wasn't even a wink in the gene pool's eye, by golly.  I didn't talk about it last night because I wanted to see how long we could adhere to one topic. I notice I jump around a lot, and I wanted to see how long I could keep one going. Obviously, not long. Thusly is my ADD.  Seriously, I'm one of those guys that's going to be late for his own wedding because he was too enthralled by a pretty butterfly hovering delicately outside a nearby window.   Doublesigh.
