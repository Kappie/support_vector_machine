The social test I thought did go actually pretty good and well I understood most of the math today.  I still haven't told Alex that I am not really interested in him in the way I thought I was.  I don't know how to tell him and I don't want to upset him and well thatt is actually one of the things I am least worried about right now.  After lunch today though I felt a bit better.  My science teacher from last year just stopped to ask how chem is going and I felt for once she understood how I feel about like stuff like chem and stuff.  I don't think anyone really realizes how stressful it can be to try really hard and not be able to understand.  And well I wish I knew why I don't always understand and things are really hard but I guess I will have to keep wondering.  I went to chem tutorial today and got some extra help the equations for boyles law and charles law and well I think the combined formula is pretty easy but I think the ratio thing we did was kinda confusing for me but the chem teacher didn't seem to understand where I was coming from cause she kept saying it was so easy.  She needs to realize that not everyone finds the same thing as easy as others might.  After Mrs. J little short talk with me after lunch though I actually kinda felt better about things.  Strangly enough and well tonight I went home and just took my time to go through my chem before the quiz.  I understand it alot better and I didn't cry tonight, and tonight I actually feel glad to be alive.  Survivor is on at 9 and well I found out today that the Clay Aiken Cd came out!!!!  I love Clay!!!  He is one of my role models so yeah.  Hopefully, after all my studying and hard work I will be able to do good on my Chem quiz and ya know what I believe in myself right now.  I really think that I can be successful and do good.  I feel like my mood has kinda been uplifted and for once I have a real good feeling.  I feel good inside which certainly is a rare feeling that only comes along every now and then.  I feel happy, and glad, and important.  I feel loved, and cherished, and like I can do the things I put my mind to.  Well it certainly is like the opposite of yesterdays feeling but I like it right now.
