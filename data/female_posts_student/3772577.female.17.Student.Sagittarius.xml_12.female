If I were with him we would both be happy. I feel like I need to be there when he comes home from work, need to be the arms he comes to when he needs comfort, need to be beside him to drive away the sleepless nights. Here all I can do is think of these things, pray that he is safe, that he'll come home to me safe, that I will see him again on the weekend. I wish I could spend my summer down there with him, but I have to work, I need to be here and earn some money for after school. Maybe this will teach us how to be apart though; how lucky we were when we saw each other everyday, how lucky we are to live beside each other. Thinking about my future with M scares me. Yesterday I suddenly stupidly imagined what it would  be like if he died. And I can't imagine it. It doesn't work in my mind. The possibility doesn't exist. Even the thought of us breaking up and after some time being with other people doesn't work in my mind, although this is the more logical and likely outcome of the two scenarios. After all you go through with someone, after how indescribably close you become to someone in all sorts of ways, how can you be with someone else after that and forsake the first person? I don't understand that. But all I can do for now is think of what he is doing right now, what he's thinking, wait till I can phone him, and dream of when we will see each other again. I sit here writing this wearing one of his shirts. The smell and feel of him encircles me.
