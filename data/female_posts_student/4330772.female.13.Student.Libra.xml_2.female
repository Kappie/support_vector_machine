I'll tell you a little bit about myself since it's going to be fun for me.  I'm 14 years old and I live in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. My life is what other people would call boring, but I like it just fine because basically, my life is music and I think just about everything else is superficial. I know, it's so cliche, being a teenager who says they 'love music' but I do think it's rare to fine someone my age who has such a passion for it as I do. There, I'm done being all smart, and now I'll get on with being entertaining. I bathe, therefore I have friends. I would write a list of bands I love, but I don't feel like it...so I'll do it later. Remind me, you person who doesn't read this. There. I just wanted to get this thing started, I'm off to go look at other people's weblogs. Much love, peace, and voting for John Kerry. Bye.
