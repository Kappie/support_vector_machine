Although I can't ask for much because they did an unbelievable version of Bartender and a full band Dancing Nancies directly into Warehouse. I was going nuts! And with whatever condition I have now, I wasted all my energy on Dancing Nancies and Warehouse. After that was over I had nothing left in me but it's Dave so I kept standing and kept going, but I will be honest, I felt like I wanted to collapse the entire last half of the show. I am so weak it's killing me. But I didn't want Jen to know that I wasn't having the best time so I tried to keep a smile plastered on my face when really all I wanted to do was crawl in bed. And because I have no emotional stability I found this sad enough to cry over but fortunately held back the tears till I had dropped everyone off. And this was rather difficult since we had to sit in the parkinglot without moving an inch... literally... no one moved AT ALL by the time we even found my car... which was a whole 30 minute ordeal anyway complete with some guy yelling out to Jen that she had a nice ass. Let me tell you boy, even though I know you'll never read this, you had no effect on her at all in fact I think she found you slightly repulsive so I would try a whole different approach if I were you. But once I was alone I broke down into tears out of pure exhaustion and frustration for being so exhausted on a night I wanted to forget that I am sick and have so much energy. Even now I tear up just thinking about how badly I wanted to enjoy last night like I have past shows and the only reason I couldn't fully do so was because I felt like I was dying. I am such a reject. Oh and now Toni has walked in the door loud as shit and I am not angry at her but I feel like shit right now and she's so loud and I have no right to go tell her to shut up because it's 11 in the morning and none of this is her fault. But anyway, back to the end of the show. What you are was the closer and it rocked! Awesome! It was fantastic! Some didn't like it but I really loved the intro to this, sort of an India feel if you ask me. But whatever. Anyway, so I have to go take the stereo away from Toni now so I can make this cds for my friend at work. Cheers.
