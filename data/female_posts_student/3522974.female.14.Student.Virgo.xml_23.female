When we got there we mat up with Jess and we all ordered. Han, Jess, Beth, Ash and I all had this huge plate of 2 chocolate pancakes, surrounded with strawberries, topped with cream and ice-cream and then smothered in chocolate. It was soooo filling. Before eating it we were all soo hungry, then 2 mouthfulls later we were all rubbing our stomachs. In the end everyone got like half way through theirs and then gave up. We then all played with our food for a while, making faces in it and stuff. Afterwards we all split up and had a wonder around the markets. Everyone was overwhelmed by the tempting chocolates and bought fudge bars and strawberry chocolate things. Not me, they were tempting, but i think i have had enough chocolate to last a life time. Well maybe not that long. ehe. Instead i bought some candy from 'the rocks candy kitchen'. Mmm...Yeh well, we caught a bus back to Glenrose and all went our seperate ways. cm
