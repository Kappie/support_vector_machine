It was harmless and she didnt even barely talk to me, she watched buffy or something on her laptop and i read and played casino on my phone for way to long. I should gamble for real someday, i kick ass at it.     I'm finally starting to get really excited about prom. Theres so many things to do this week before the dance... i need to go get a new necklace( the one i bought doesn't go with my dress...what a waste of 14 dollars. RAR!) get a "boutanere" for Matt ( i have no idea how to spell "boutanere"...lets call it "crazy flower arrangment that the boy wears on his jacket." okay.) find someone to do my makeup( I'm really bad at things concerning my face...or something) and I need to go mystic tanning with Genie (which scares me the crap out of me...what if I'm crazy orange for the dance? Orange skin and black dress? clearly i dont want to be halloween style.)    So, yes. Many many things to do. As well as things concerning prom i need to find a job (still.) and i need to put together Tim's b-day present and send it off to him before wednesday. And right now...yeah...i should be finishing my u.s. history essay on "movements, ideas, and people that shaped the 50's and 60's". MRRAAHH!! i sleep first period...how am i supposed to know these things...   Oh yeah...i just remembered the mass amounts of math i was supposed to do this weekend. right. forgot about that. hmm.    So, just because i don't want to do my essay, here's the deal with prom.  7:00AM. A WAY to early breakfast at...actually I don't know where.   - to 11:30AM. Everyone at DeMeyer park to play frisbee golf ( not entirely to excited about this idea)  12:00 PM. Staci and I will run off and Get our hair done.  4:30 PM. Everyone is due back at DeMeyer dressed and ready so parents can come and take pictures.  5:30PM. Dinner reservations. Where? I dont remember what Matt told me. This is the beauty of leaving the boys up to planning things..i dont have to know any details, i just go with the flow.  7:00 pm to 10:00pm. The dance at the Big Easy.  wee!! The part I'm most excited for...i love dancing so so much and would never get a chance to if it wasn't for dances.  10:00 -? Everyone is camping up near Lucky Peak. Staci and I ( and possibly Kaley) will be sharing a tent, and then the next morning everyone is getting up and going boating. (its WAY to cold to be boating, but whatever. I'll be fully equipped with sweatshirts and jeans...the swimsuit will be under like 5 layers of clotheing. Dammit, i just thought of something else. I need to go swimsuit shoppping this week too. To many things to do!  Anyways, thats prom in a nutshell for you. My dad said he's cool with the camping thing, which is excellent.  And Genie is coming to prom to, which way excites me, because we now have an amazing plan to get pretty face into a suductive trap. BWAHA! and we'll get to dance to "Yeah"...it will just be awesome.    hmm. should probably go to bed soon. Nate and I are "supposidly" dateing...but i seriously haven't had any contact with him since... last monday. Stupid ass, if he doesn't care enough to call me all week then i sure as hell won't care back. I was going to call him today but found myself thinking its not worth it. maybe he's not worth it. Atleast right now. Whateves...I'm sick of talking about it.  I'm off.  Sleep.
