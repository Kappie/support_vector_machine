I would be happier if it was boiling hot and not threatening rain though! Hmm... but were in England though and that's close to impossible! Do you remember doing sun dances in year 2? Hmm... scary! Eeeek! But seriously, we did a load of scary things when we were kids. *gags laura and izzy* Ahhh... better... Hey has any one got a sledge hammer? I need to hit my ear cause it's gone again and i can't hear any thing! Apart from the bubbling gunk... which is kind of unnerving cause it never goes quiet. Hmm... some one blog! I'm boring!
