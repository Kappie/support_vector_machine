I got only 4....i'm not loved....:'(  i spent all my time writing letters for everyone else who asked me but what do i get?  I wrote letters to at least 7 people!  :'(  try to be nice to some people and they dont even thank you.  Not saying that i'm ungrateful.  I'm happy that some people wrote stuff to me but WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST?!?!?  Never being nice again.  i'm joking, joking.  I'm happy because everyone else will be happy when they read the letters.  I'm happy coz i just gave everyone happiness. ^_^
