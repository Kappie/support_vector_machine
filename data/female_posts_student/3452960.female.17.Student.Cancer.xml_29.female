We've had three exams already including our french oral exam. We've also had french listening and ICT. They're pretty easy...but then so is RE! I can't stand cricket...*gah* and this Olly lad sounds like a bit of a character! I don't know Mr Gruitt but I know copying teachers is a BAD idea (Mr Grindell influenced me to get out the razor...) if you don't know Grindy I'm sure Dave'll explain. My god I'm tired, I'll fill in another day.
