She's gorgeous. and they had ppl talking about her killer( who they had caught) and what to do and if they should bargin with him. and....god... for the parents to sit there, and her their daughter be refered to as, "her remains".... i cannot belive how they could stand it. i mean, she was from a moderatly big town. nothing special. but why her? this mexican guy rodriguez, abducted her, and he was caught and one of her shoes was found around michigan... uh! it just terrifies me. and makes me want to scream at these sick people. WHY?! this rodriguez guy had already been charged and sentenced to jail time for rape. and he got out, and then did it again. no telling what he put her through. can you even imagine? no. because you may feel safe in your suburban homes and be trusting of people and give everyone a chance, innocent until proven otherwise. i always like to. but when shit like this happenes. how can you do that? huh? what makes me want to go out of my house and meet new people when i know that there is this in the world. there is an 85% probility Dru is dead. raped tortured god knows what. and then left somewhere. or buried. she was what 18? 19? she hadn't lived. Who the FUCK is this man that thinks he has the GOD DAMNED right to steal that from HER!!!??? and now he is being held. and they wont lessen his punishment if he confesses or not, so he sees nothing in it for him... GOD DAMNIT!  for there is notcrime worse than the killing of one human being by another.      she was so pretty...
