I wish I could have gone away some where this vacation. Stupid track and it ruleing my life. Stupid having to train for Penn. But, I'm happy to be going. But... yeah... so this vacation holds one major goal for me: to not say in every night like a total lozer. I seriously need to get out of this house and have some fun. I mean for months on in my world has been ruled by track and school and it's nice to be rid of at least one of them and I mean track is only in the morning so what ever with that ya know? So if you'r reading this and live in the Staten Island area just know Lauren is free just about every day for the next two weeks. TWO WEEKS!! AHHHHHH!!! NO SCHOOL FOR TWO FUCKIN WEEKS!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! That's awesome. And it's starting off with a real BANG and a half. Tonight I'm just gonna vist Debra for a little bit, see how he knee is coming along, should get home around 7. Then tonight, I have to study for the ACT tomorrow. Then, tomrrow after the ACT I'm going to go to Ms. Erardi's (soon to be Mrs. Iosue, I'm so NOT calling her that) wedding, the church part at least. I'm going to write her a really nice card and maybe she'll raise my average to like an 80. Then, Saturday night Erica and I are gonna babysit Mario and then Sunday I'm going to my dads for Palm Sunday. Monday I take my drivers ed test though so we will see how that goes. x0x
