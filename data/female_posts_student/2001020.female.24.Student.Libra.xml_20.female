I just ate, I'm full, and feeling fat. You know how that goes? But I am too tired to do anything about the fat part. Working late hours never lends itself to exercise. All I know is that I gotta get myself into a routine before law school. Not really good to be set on laziness. I'm watching that dumb American Idol show. Some of these people can sing, but some of them are so annoying and pathetic, I want to slap the blond tips and tight jeans off of them. Anyway...have I said enough? Or maybe too much? I'm gonna check and see who called my cell phone and then lay down. Whoa, the guy Simon on this show just ripped that little teenager guy apart...he wasn't that great, anyways. Dumb little painted-on boy. Enough of me! Bye bye.
