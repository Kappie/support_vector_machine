I hate males. they are so....maddening. oh well...la la la la la.....adams song is REALLY good. It is my favorite song by Blink 182. well I am in a conferssing mood today so I am going to confess something...nope...my life isnt that interesting there is nothing I can really confess...hmm...*trying to think of something that I could confess.* lol it is a good thing I'm not catholic or christian or whichever it is that has those confession booths. lol I am a loser...oh well I do not  care much for not being a loser. sometimes us loser have more fun than the non losers, actually we always do! lol. I really am beginning to really like Bright Eyes. they are really good...and so are the Desaparcidos or however you spell it cause I dont fathom a clue :) I am very diffucult. I drive people insane  cause I can never make up my mind. see like that she got mad at me because I didnt answer her right away. maybe I shouldve just said no...lol that woulda done just as much good as not answering. she gets mad either way. so touchy!! oh wellish. I'm emotionally unstable :) yes thats what I sam going to confess! cause it is very true cause I am emotionally unstable. in fact I am not stable in any way whatso ever!! lol the book I am reading has alot of spelling mistakes...I wonder if anyone has told them that they suck at spelling...even if the book is kick ass. :) la la la la I like movies and t.v. even if I rarely watch them anyways. Girl Interrupted was the best movie ever. I want to be like Daisy when I grow up :) or maybe like Lisa cause she was a schizo....I have a odd fascination with schizo's and with gay men.lol. wow that must sound odd...:) thats ok I am odd. *cause I'm Broken* I real y like that song...I wish I could Sing Like Amy Lee. she has the most beautiful voice...*sighs with envy* the Willy Wonka Theme is odd..:) it is great though. *the fake sound of progress* thats a good song too. it is too bad I dont have a working c.d. with alot of good songs on it...*glares at newly burnt and non working c.d.*  the feeling's to intense, sitting on the fence...I really like the Lost Prophets. and alot of other bands but it would take me forever to list them and I would probably forget alot of them anyways...I cant delete my avatar and it is driving me loopy...lol I have said that to three people already this morning. krysstaallll I looovveee youuu....and now I am going to leave. bye bye.  Boo!.!
