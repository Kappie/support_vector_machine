But anyways, every time my lunch break's over I have to walk to the high school...which is ok, but it's so fuggin' hot outside. For the past three days, every time people see me walking carrying a big thermos of water, looking down at the ground and walking in the sun, they ask me if I need a ride. The first day, which was the second day of marching band camp, two squadleaders stopped and asked me if I need a ride to the highschool. Without even thinking, I said, "Um, nah I'd rather walk... Thanx anyway." They asked me if I was sure, and I told them that I was. So I kept walking. The second day this lady was taking her daughter to the high school, and she asked me if I needed a ride. Of course, I told her that I'd walk, but thanked her anyway. This day a kind old man offered a ride, but yet again I said, "No, thanx." It's not that I'm scared that they're gonna rob me and do something to me or whatever, it's just that I really wanna walk. That might sound crazy but who cares. =P  I'm a bit late, but I forgot to mention this on the first day of marching band... My brother's girlfriend, Vanessa-san, is going to be marching with us because she's a "high-hat" (sp?!). Y'know, it's kinda spiffy... It feels weird, though. XD She's a sophmore, so...yeah. Stephanie-san, Nessa's friend, is also there. I hope I can march with them some time. =P But anyways, I'll start off my crappy day...  Today we learned the X Drill... It's harder than the Box Drill, but hopefully I'll get the hang of it. I kept messing up during the X Drill (but I wasn't the only one...most freshmen had trouble with that) and maybe it's just me but a squadleader laughed at me. I don't know if she was laughing at something else, but when Mr. Williams came up to help me she just started to laugh...not loud, though. Blah, who cares?! I bet they had trouble with this too when they were just starting to march. =P I'm also having trouble marching backwards... I always seem to be a little off from the yard line, and sometimes I think I'm bouncing up and down. Maybe I should try harder.  One hour before we were able to go inside, the band directors held their "annual freshmen marching competition." It was in no form or way a competition: it was a popularity contest. Ok, y'see, all the freshmen were supposed to march and do whatever their band directors told them to, and the squadleaders are supposed to vote for the best marcher. Of course, this was not true at all. First the girls had to march, then the boys. I thought I marched pretty good, and when the squadleaders had to vote, I had no one behind me. All of my g33ky and not-so-popular-friends didn't even make it to the second phase. Vanessa-san got like two votes or something, but anything counts. I didn't care who won, because it wasn't about how good you march, but just how popular you are.  I need to pass off two things before I can get my uniform. I need to play October (the song, not the month) and do the Box Drill while playing the Bb Scale... I figured it can't be so hard, but we'll see. Hopefully I'll pass it off tomorrow, because the uperclassmen are gonna come tomorrow and they're gonna take all the good uniforms. And while we're waiting in line, they have the right to skip freshmen, sophmores and juniors...and some seniors, too. So, yeah...I think all of my friends are gonna get the "bad" uniforms, including me. Pfft, oh well.   Also, since today was squadleader appreciation day, I gave Jennifer-san, a flute squadleader, a dollar. I know it's not much, but anything counts, right? I gave it to her because she "helped" (only Sally-chan and I know what we mean by that ;P) Sally-chan and me pass the 16-marching-forward-steps-with-your-eyes-closed-thingy. She made it soooo easy for us! XD I still don't like this marching band stuff. Bleeeeeeh.  Y'know, it's ironic how I said that I didn't like Sarah-san [B]. Maybe I didn't like her because of how she acted the few times that I'd talk to her...but now that I see her and talk to her a little bit more, I guess she's ok. I mean, after all, I have to pass off stuff with her and all... I should give people some chances. XD Hehe, it was funny because as we were walking, Sarah-san was singing a part of the Freshmore song, which was this, "Help me, I'm weak and lazy. Give me a break before I go crazy." And after she said that, she started doing a weird dance and said, "Well, too late for me, I'm already crazy!" Ha-ha! XD It was hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing...oh boy, retardness.  As we were going outside the band hall to go to our sweet homes, I started a stupid inside-joke...probably the most retarded one. See, Sarah-san was talking in her cellphone, and we were just talking and talking. So, she said, "Hey, you guys! I need to hear what my mom's saying." So.... I started to growl. It was so stupid! Then everyone started growling for no reason, and we continued doing so and so until we got in front of the stadium. See how stupid I am?! But I guess it's ok, since everyone was laughing because everyone was growling. =s People kept staring at us, though. =P Don't you just love inside jokes?  To close this off, I'll say that I'm getting darker. Nooooo!!! I don't want to get dark! I really wanna stay pale. Ugh, look what marching band has done to me. =P
