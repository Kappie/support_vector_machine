My mom and sister and I went over to someone's new house to help em paint. That was fun b/c I like to paint a lot! We got it most of the way finished, but then we had to leave, which was a bummer b/c I wanted to finish it...oh well. Tonight I'm going to my bro's musical, "The Nifty Fifties." It will hopefully be a good show! Whelp Chels, hope you feel better!
