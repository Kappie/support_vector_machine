I mean yeah sure i've had my share of guys and god i know i loved the attention but being single is still great you can have as many guys as you want and not get in trouble. There's these couple of guys who i really really like but i know i cant have them for one one of them lives in the north island while im in the south and the other one while he constantly tells me im hot fails 2 show any sign of interest which is frustrating at times but who doesnt like a good flirt? i have to admit i am definetly a sucker for a hot older guy lol and doesnt everyone know it, like ultimate babes paul walker and chad michael murray! The only thing i have against some of you chicks out there is when a good old crush turns 2 obsession no your not really in love with him 1. your not going out 2. your always making the phone calls, e-mails and what not look just get over him if you havent got his attention already dont push him 2 hard if he wants you he'll show it or hopefully will anyway. hope this helped or was at least worth reading. steph
