It's around 11:30pm when I am rushing to finish my homework, and I run into this site, don't ask how...well you can ask me if you want. Anyways it's pretty funny, and it's easy to see that the author of the site is either a genius explaining to masses (asses) or a complete failure in life (like me) who is trying to act smart. Yea I thought it was the second one too.
