I want you to know how much I value you while you were in such a big hurry How am I to tell you that I love you when you not even cherish our time How will you then know?  I want you to know that I enjoy being with you but you just smirk and snicker like a fool Wish you’d know how much I wish for you  But as always, you were busy How will you thereupon know?  Times are when i needed you so badly All I want was a simple grin from you But for once you didn’t even bother With how you arrogantly deal? How will you then promptly know?  You constantly indulge in my reveries but you seem so millions away from me that at times I could not reach you. But now you'll never know this things For those times you were not here with me  How absurd it is for me to still love you When it has been obvious enough That I see no reason for me not to But despite these things that befall… How will you know?
