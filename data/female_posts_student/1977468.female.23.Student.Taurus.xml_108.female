I will probably never enjoy a hamburger again. Thanks alot Alec Baldwin, you informative ass. On the flip side, I'm not crazy about becoming a vegitarian either. See, I don't even know if I spelled that right. I couldn't do it.    Then there's Peta funding the eco-terrorists, who blow up buildings. And burn stuff down. I read that in Time Magazine. Granted, it was an anti-Peta ad. But that's not cool you know? If chickens could own land deeds, would they still do that to humans? Where's Peta when the slaughter house is happening to people?  ...  Is there no middle ground? Perhaps if we gave each cow a funeral, my concious would be eased. At camp, when we caught the fish, I prayed over each one. That they would pass into the darkness in peace.     Does anyone think those animals don't know whats going on? At least sedate them or something. My sister won't go to the dentist without being sedated. Maybe that poses other problems when we want to eat them.      If your thinking "oh look at the sissy girly man", that video says chickens can play videogames better then monkeys. Video Games people. Chickens have over 100 different squacks, in which they can designate whether a preditor is traveling over land or water.      If I can make one vow, I will say that I will never kill an animal disrespectfully. I met a chicken one time, and I thought he was cute. I'm sure I'd hate him in the long run. But for that day, we were friends. Till I ran out of food.      Perhaps the only thing to do is to make a t-shirt.       "Animal Cruelty is Flipin Not Good."      I thought about "Animal Cruelty Sux Eggs." but that could be taken as a horrible pun.      Eggs was a subtitute for ass. "Animal Cruelty Sux Ass." is really too... I dunno, Flipin Not Good is better somehow.     When I see meat now, I hear the cow's voice. It's saying "Mooo.. mooo..." as if to tell me, "Be aware Dave, for the end is ny! Woe to thou whost feed the machines of torment, for in the end all shalt reap what they hath sown!"
