I want to throw out there the open ended invite to all my fun friends;) ... PLEASE come visit! I am going to miss everyone and realistically HOW do you think you can pass up a FREE place to stay in the most AMAZING place ever! SUNNY CALI! Just think about that for a minute... Truly reflect and then get back to me on that one... I mean really...Tiffany is doing it, everyone is doing it, why aren't you?! Do Not confuse this with peer pressure and let me know when to expect you!
