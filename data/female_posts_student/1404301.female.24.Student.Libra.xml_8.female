Edouard and her met during their intern programs in Marseille and they are now engaged. She is a wonderful person and she is also very pretty, Edouard is a lucky guy!!  Anyway, I wanted to talk about Audrey  because it is her name's day today. So, as a French would say: "Bonne fete Audrey!".  Love to you and Edouard!
