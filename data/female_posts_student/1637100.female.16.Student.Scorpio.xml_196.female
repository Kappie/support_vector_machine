ARGH. k well they only won by one point.. but still. and then it was grade 12, then 10, then our class. like usual. we always lose. well, at least this year we only lost by like 6 points. anyways. this year was screwed up anyways. the theme was "energy" and the grade nines i guess they deserved winning because they were the class with the most class spirit. i think. oh well. it was sorta fun i guess. oh well. next year. yeah right. the only time we have won class challenge was in grade 7 and then in grade 8 we got second i think and the rest of the time (grade 6 and 9-11) we have lost. anyhoo. when i got home this afternoon i had a splitting headache from all the "excitement [?]" and yelling/cheering. i had a splitting headache. yeah. and i was oh-so-tireded.. so when i got home i turned on the tv and watched a couple pointless shows such as some weird cartoon and sabrina and then some really QUEER show called "boohbah" and i think it is literally queer. its like sposed to be for little kids or sum'n coz it was on PBS (lol) and it has like these weird things that are like rainbow colours and they do weird things like spin in circles and stuff and poke their heads outta their shell thingys. and then these weird ppl that are like dressed normal and everything but they're weird. and then little kids dance around saying "look what i can do" and the whole tiem theres like rainbows everywhere.. =S yeah its like a lullabye.. although i was already tired, i fell asleep right after the show ended and slept for almost 2 hours. it was relaxing. then i watched simpsons twice and then king of the hill. it was entertaining. now my dads family is over at my house for jo's and uncle jim's bday. i am so full. mom made turkey dinner. it was sooooo yummy!!! and now its gonna be dessert time soon. tomoro is church. hmmm. ooh ooh!! im going to acquire the fire. its towards the end of this month. oops. i shoulda practiced the piano today. oh well. i shall go now. must find coffee or some other form of caffeine.............
