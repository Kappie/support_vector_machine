(i was going to say I would be sick of him...but that would be such a bad lie!) Well on SUnday night, Matt and I went to the diner, but the worst thing happened: Dave came a long! Dave was flirting with Matt all night long. It was just so wrong. I remember all those times Dave would tell me how evil Matt is and that I shouldn't go places with him. ANd now when he sees him again, Dave tells me how hott Matt looked and how Dave thought "Matt was flirting with me" quote by dave. MATT ISN'T GAY! He never will be either. I swear Dave gets these crazy thoughts in his head! We made this awesome drink. There were so many bad ingredients mixed together. For example, we mixed: jello, whip cream, sugar, tapioca pudding, cigarette ashes, salt, pepper, ice cubes, coffee, and water. It was really crazy. It tasted really good though. Me and Matt tried it. It was actually not too bad tasting. I thought I was probably gonna die because of the cigarette ashes and stuff. It was funny. Matt looked so cute tonight. He was wearing this "Dragonfly" shirt, which was sexy tighter and black. He looked good in it. We all watched Aqua Teen Hunger Force then when we went back to my house. It was pretty fun. I couldn't stop laughing. I noticed that Matt would look at me a lot and see if I was laughing or not. It almost seemed like he cared about me. Hehe. I had another great night with him. Peace out
