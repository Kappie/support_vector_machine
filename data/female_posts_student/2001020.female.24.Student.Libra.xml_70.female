I'm going to fail this semester miserably if I don't get my sorry ass act together...where is my motivation this year?  Is it because the fear is all gone?  Is it because I just don't care anymore?  What the hell is it?  I wish I could figure it out, but as I sit here, attempting to get a jump start on studying for finals, I find myself more and more interested in anything BUT getting a jump start on finals.  I think I am addicted to the Internet.  Is that possible?  I just like the fact that the light on the Internet is always on, and there's always life out there, and there are always things to learn from the people busily ticking away on their keyboards out there.  I wonder what will replace the Internet, b/c we all know that something has to.  Or maybe it doesn't HAVE to, but it will.  The Internet is ridiculously fabulous, though, no matter how bad it is for me and my studies.  Information all at your fingertips...conversations to be had, confessions to be made...news to be read, opinions to be analyzed...why didn't I go into journalism or something like that?  I need some ACTION in my life, and I don't mean in my bedroom (b/c frankly, I'm perfectly happy with that aspect!).  -sigh-  I should return to the wonderful world of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.  I'm gonna.  I'll see ya 'round.
