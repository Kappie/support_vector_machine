Where will you hide? Lullabies To paralyze  Fat and soft, pink and weak, Foot and thigh, tongue and cheek You know I'm told they swallow you whole, Skin and bone Cutting boards and hanging hooks, Bloody knives, cooking books Promising you won't feel a thing At all  Swallow and chew Eat you alive All of us food that hasn't died    Ive had it up to here with ancient history, but Im not as stressed as I was before. In fact Im getting to my  Wow I really dont care I just want exams to be over  stage. Which is not good when you haven't even studied half the stuff yet.  Kate that pizza was really good but I dont feel so great right now.. Istanbul, not Constantinople, Instanbul.. haha yes, I got it to work. [Sigh]..  Someone broke a string on my acoustic guitar and that does not make me happy. What does make me happy is toothpastefordinner and the fact that I found the acoustic guitar one!!!  I think my study break should've been over half an hour ago.
