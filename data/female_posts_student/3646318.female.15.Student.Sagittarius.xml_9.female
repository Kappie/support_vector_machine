I mean safe isn’t bad, but I’m TATIANA, I’m the girl who always goes after the hard to get bad boy rebel and I usually win but I don’t actually get a relationship out of it. *sigh* Yey? I won? I got exactly what I wanted, and I feel good. Just kind of safe and boring.  I mean I feel bad because he always talks about marriage, and love and stuff. I’m not ready for marriage…I love him….I don’t want kids until like 26...and he also doesn’t really understand my need for letting go.( example: He doesn’t want to let me go away from him. Like College, THAT is what he’s scared of. Of losing me. And I need a breather) I love him. Seriously.  I lost my virginity to him, he’s the first GUY I actually gave oral sex to {I’ve been told I’m “outstanding“} ( well…willing oral sex. Long story short. I was real drunk, gun to my head…yada..yada. Didn’t remember for a while), and he was the first guy to see ME. Not just how I looked, but ME. I love him so much and I don’t want to hurt him. And if he even felt half of the way I do, I’d be crushed. Completely. *sigh* That’s half the story. I’ve known another guy since a while but I actually liked him in 8th grade, and a little this year. I don’t love him, but I do really like him. I like chilling with him, even if he does say I’m boring. He’s my little Froggie, I would actually die if he read this, but I doubt he will. So it’s cool beans. I mean I hung out with him today, it was nice, it was also werid because I kinda wanted to kiss him ( I didn’t. Kinda regret it…but whatever). I mean this guy has something my boyfriend doesn’t….I can actually chill with him without having to think about sex, drugs ( as fun as those may be) , or how “uncomfortable” I am. Actually I don’t think I wanna have sex with him, but I really like him. For real. He’s a genuinely nice person to me but I don’t usually have a relationship with nice people…since they tend to make me lose interest pretty fast…and usually end up hating me afterwards . And I don’t want things to ever get too weird between my Froggie and me because…I like him and because we live close. *ppffft/sigh* It doesn’t really matter much about what my feelings are anyways( as if they ever did)…because nothing can happen between my Froggie and me while Steven and I are going out. I guess it’s okay with me because although I do like Froggie a lot, I don’t think a relationship would actually work out. Hell, I doubt even a secret relationship would work out...for 2 main reasons and a bunch of other details.. 1. I don’t think he likes me that way anyways( most guys in this neighborhood don’t.. …2. Even if he does like me that way, I doubt he’ll want to like make-out and mess around my boyfriend’s back and even if he‘s okay with it...somehow he’d tell or something and it’d get back to Steven and well…it’d be hell. I cant do that. Yeah, so I guess I’ll try to leave things the way they are now unless something new happens…or...I dunno. Time will tell. Thing will chill out… PEACE!
