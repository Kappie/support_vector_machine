But I know he talked to his family today, soin a few days I will probably hear something from his mom. I jumped everytime my phone rang. sad.   Ihaven't had more than 3 hrs of sleep for 6 out of the past 7 nights. I don't know what my deal is. I'm just so excited about the upcoming weeks.It's nice to have something to look forward to.
