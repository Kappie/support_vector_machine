A part of me feels like I should just really leave him alone, so I don't mess up his no dating rule. Another part of me really wants him to forget about that. I just don't know what to do. I want to be able to support him and his decisions, but at the same time, if I were to do that, I'd be doing exacly opposite of what I want. What to do, what to do?   -Ali
