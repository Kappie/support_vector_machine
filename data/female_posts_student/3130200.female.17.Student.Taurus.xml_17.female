I need to vent or I am going to break something and there are a lot of valuable items around.  Here is the situation. The family has decided to take a long weekend in Breckenridge. It was decided that we would drive with the camper to Breck and just camp in a campground. Anyway, from pretty much the conception of the idea, I let everybody in the family know that I would not be going on this extended weekend. 4 days confined to a suburban and a camper is not my idea of a good vacation...more like my worst nightmare. Ok, so they are planning on leaving this Friday morning and not coming back until Monday afternoon or evening. That is four good solid days of no chaos, nagging, or familial duties that I need to deal with. Four days all to myself. I  was  looking forward to it.  Here is where I get pissed off. The grandparents have been contemplating moving to Northern Colorado for about 4 months. Well, since the beginning of the summer (June) they have been here a total of 3 separate times, each individually amounting to approximately 5-7 days at our house as guests. They are here right now, and have been since last Tuesday. Even without what I am about to tell you, they are getting on my nerves. They drink all the pop and eat all the cereal and for the first two visits I spent  my  free time trying to entertain  them , and I hate that. They invade my privacy and my space and needless to say I have had it. I am being pushed to the point where all civility, graciousness, and politeness is gone. I go to a friends house or just plain get out of the house, from the time I wake up 'till around 9 o'clock at night, because I know if I talk to them I will say that is  very very  mean.  Here is where I get overwhelmingly and uncontrollably enraged. So, earlier this evening I find out that the grandparents will not be going back to Oregon anytime soon. In fact, they will be staying at our house while the rest of the family is on gone. They will be in MY HOUSE while my family is gone and I was supposed to have it to MYSELF. I want to scream. I want to cry and yell and slam doors and throw things.  I am so incredibly frustrated with them and angry with them. They are guests in my house and they have treated me like a doormat. We have extended our home to them while they search for one of their own and it is time for them to get the hell out of dodge. Don't they have any sense of common decency? A regular person, would not impose on people in the way they have to my family and me. A regular person would understand that a week of staying in someone's house is really pushing it. A regular person wouldn't stay in a vacant house while the occupants are on vacation. Does that seem odd to anyone but me? I am also very angry at my parents for not growing a fucking backbone and telling them that they need to get a hotel room or go back to Oregon, just get out of our damn house.  Here is where I have to make a decision I should never have had to make in the first place if I was a respected member of this household. Do I go on the shitty family vacation or do I put up with the relatives for four days. I was really really looking forward to having time alone to myself for those 4 days because its hard to get time alone when there are 5 people in this house. But, on the same note I really really do not want to spend 4 days with my grandparents. Really really not. I also don't want to be with my family for 4 days in a camper. I need to do some thinkin on this one.  My words may have sounded harsh, but you have to understand where I am coming from. For nearly half of my summer, my grandparents have been here. That is hardly what I would consider a summer vacation. I don't know what I am going to do. Maybe there's a pencil I can snap or a pillow I can scream into nearby.
