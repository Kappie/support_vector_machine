Pat really wanted to go, and i had never been so i was cool wit it. and it wasnt that bad, i was really lookin forward to swimin with teh dolphins cuz in teh brochure it advertised that u could. and we got there and found out u had to make fuckin reservations and the soonest open was next month, so i didnt swim with teh dolpins.. i was pissed lol. o well.. i did see shamu tho! lol. thats a big son of a bitch when u sit in teh 3rd row~damn... oh and i was feeding the seals fish, and a fuckin bird liek attacked me! i hate birds. anyways, so we didnt get caught in any bad weather since we left early. i talked to shane almost every night, and im lookin forward to seein him for xmas. break. i miss him. the only person i missed while i was gone, was my dad and dog. lol. me and my dad r close, well we dont talk much or do anything anymore cuz he is always working now. but he still is my best friend. my mom and me didnt fight very much in FL. so thats a plus. and Pat was cool liek usual, but everytime she lit up a cig. i like wanted to take teh damn thing away from her, god it killed me. i think my mom knows i smoke again, i dk tho'. my dad said he wouldnt care if i didnt have asthma, but i dont think i have it anymore so w/e. tommrow im goin skool shoppin with shanna and skylar. i missed them too i forgot to mention. shit skool starts soon, that sux but i really got to try this yr and make sum decent grades to make up for frosh and soph. yr. cuz i did bad. cydney and danny just called theyre at chase's partyin' they told me to come out, but im soo damn tired, so im gunna go next weekend with cyd pry. well i took liek 4 dramamine so im about o pass out. nighty night ppl. much love
