That's right, I hate to break Jackie's bubble; I have gotten in contact with Spinner thanks to a good friend which will remain secret. I also think Jackie needs to really think, Spinner and I have been friends much longer than Jackie and I. Yet, Jackie is actually trying to tell Spinner and I that we are not allowed to talk to each other. No one takes on us and wins. We just proved that, and it wasn't even that hard to do. So if Jackie wants to apologize then I am waiting, otherwise I don't want to talk to her. Anyway, I have to go and talk to Spinner about things, and hopefully she will join us with this website.
