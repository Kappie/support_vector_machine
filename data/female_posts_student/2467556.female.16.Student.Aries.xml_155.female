Vinny kinda forgot how to play hockey sometimes and screwed up some scoring opportunities....but thats ok we still love him! Now we have to complete this win/lose alterated series thing and win in Calgary for Game 6 in order to pull a Game 7.  Pray for the Lightning, i'm too scared to give a prediction.  :/  job is boring, but i got paid $75 this week.  Oh yeah so at the hockey party with Jess and Britt, i met Britt's canadian cousin. He's really hott and really funny.  He's one cool kid.  Except he doesn't watch/like hockey!!!!  *gasp!* thats the only weird part. he and i make fun of each other's accents, lol, its tons of fun.  pray that when i get home today, my internet is working :)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
