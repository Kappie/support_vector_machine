Oh my goose.. it's been forever. 3. ...filled your gas tank? I've never filled it. 4. ...got enough sleep? Last december holidays. 5. ...backed up your computer? Some time in Jan this year.  Jason(Weihoong) pleaded me to confront Sabrina during tuition just now, to let her know that it was just a prank. So Jeremy, Lucas and I gave in to him. After Sabrina got to know about it, Jason forgave me, which really didn't make a difference because he did not forgive Jeremy! It seemed like everything was back to normal, we became friends and all, but when tuition ended, Jason flared up and bellowed at us. I think what he yearned for was attention. I really have no idea what his thoughts are. One moment he tells me that we should pretend that we do not know each other, another moment he complains that he can't stand Jeremy and I ignoring him. I think that Valentines' Day prank is truly the funniest thing I've ever done in my entire life! No offence Jason, but KUDOS to Jerms! :) He also came in top for the Bio test. Smartie poo!
