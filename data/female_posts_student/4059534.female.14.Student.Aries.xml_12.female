It was a nice day today, hopefully it will start to be more warmer now. So sick of Winter. Phe, if your looking at this please post a blog so I can write heaps of annoying comments on yours, instead of having to be content with you writing on mine and me not being able to write in yours. I talked to some Dutch dude yesterday it was very weird. I couldn't slang cause he only knew like pfft... I dunno what they call it, "PROPER ENGLISH" maybe. I saw the most funniest thing in the library, you know how they've got a whole lot of phrasebooks for different countries from lonely planet. Well the library had an Australian phrasebook. It was sooo funny half the words in the book I'd never even heard before, I really truly feel sorry for any idiot who goes and actually uses the words from the phrase book. I feel a bit scared now, cause when we went to Europe I used some of the words form those lonely planet phrasebooks, I bet the locals are probably still laughing at some of the S*** I probably said. Ohh well. I don't care it was ages ago.      Anyone wanna join netball? Go to the link below...    urlLink http://www.netballvic.com.au/
