"i never said you could go!" damn, that sucked for her. so anyway, my day with turtle was great! this guy tagged along with us.... his name was chris, he was from michigan, he was gay, he liked turtle, he was wearing green, he reminded me of nicholas, he was 17, he was smart? anyway, enought about chris. wow. i had the guts. i grew today. yea right, just kidding. i called justin. yea, umm I called justin. he didnt answer, but he called back. we only talked for like not even 2 minutes, but we didnt really talk, it was more like i talked. ugh i hate when that happens. whats the point of being on the phone if only one person is talking, doesnt that defeat the whole purpose of it being a conversation?!? well i told him i saw stacy the other day....he obviously had already heard from robert, cuz kelley called me later asking if stacey was doing anything with the damn guy cuz justin wanted to know. geeze, does this girl live for gossip? what the fuck!? i hate this. thats it im gonna stop this for today, i want to get back to the life i wish i had.     "im never in my waking life, dreaming is my all the time"
