Sometimes some things just shoot me right down and others shoot me right up.  For instance, I heard a friend ran into my Mom in the grocery store and it made me happy because I thought to myself, what a good friend I know, he knows my Mom and he stopped to say hi to her, I'm lucky.  Then not even 10 minutes later another friend told me about her Canada plans and mentioned everyone that was going, and all of a sudden I dropped right down mostly out of jealousy for having not been invited, but regardless here I am.  Up down, up down...  This has become much more of a diary then anything else, sorry to bore ppl with the ramblings from inside my head...
