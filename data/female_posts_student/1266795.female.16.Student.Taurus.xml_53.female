I might be the reason behind that. *hides* Yes, Jonah, you  should  be flattered. You get the chance to bow!! :P   WOOHOO! Ali's gonna join!! By the way, I'm inviting Olivia. I'm sure YouNa wants to hear from her. (Right, YouNa??)  Ashley not hitting any mailboxes or trash cans? You need to come drive over here on Mondays. That's trash day for us. :P And I  did  notice a lack of response about the "Couch of  Love ." I personally thought it was funny. ADMIT IT! YOU DID, TOO!  And if anyone makes fun of Ash's infatuation- *ahem* I mean, LOVE, for French, I'll seriously take care of it. She's not the only one planning to major in a language in college. (points to self)  Time for shoutouts: Ash: I WANNA SEE THE GIFTS!!! SHOW ME!!! Jane: Girl, you have to get online more. And tell your parents I apologize for Saturday night. (Well, technically it was Sunday morning...) YouNa: We'll get you a copy of the movie and send it. How about that? It has English subtitles. :) And Ashley had the initial spark to get the blog going; I had wanted to do one before, but at that time Jane's computer was not compatible with Blogger. >_ Alison: GET ON HERE! Olivia: DITTO! (Well, once I've invited you...*guilty blush*) :P   EDIT  WE NOW HAVE COMMENTS! YES! Your mother is an aardvark.
