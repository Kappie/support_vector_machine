Wow I can see again! lol Then we went to pamada and bought my TV for the back room. I was happy. Then we came home and Denny came over and brought our computer back and worked on it for a few hours. It still doesn't work right. Msn wont work and I can't find my folder...but its there somewhere. We just gotta look. But the computer works like new now so im happy. Then around 2 we went to a 50th anniversary party for someone whos...kinda related...Im not sure how but they are. It was alright...Talked to Howard (my pastor) there about how he has only 5 Sundays left until hes gone :( Im gonna cry...But he already said we'd keep in touch and that he is already reserving a invitation to my graduation. LoL. Yeah then mom and I went and cleaned the library. And then we went to Germantown for supper cuz it was my Grandma Hansens B-day. And if you thought Hartley was tiny..this place had like a church, a resturant and one other business and thats all. Maybe..15 houses. Yeah super tiny. This time if you realy did blink you'd miss it. But yeah. Then yesterday I took Kim with us to Sioux Falls. We only got 4 hours to shop tho...because I had to be back for Bible School but it was alright....2 hours in I was already broke. LoL. But I got Ross his b-day present...thats one big brick lifted from my chest...So yeah...I also got a new fun skirt and some other random things...Yeah then Bible School was just grand. I helped with Pre-K. Fun stuff. I love little kids! Theres only bout 17 but 5 more are supposed to be there tonight...so who knows...LoL. We have plenty of helpers so it'll be fine. But last night was just kinda bad...cuz I got a really bad headache and I had to still help with a whole bunch of little loud kids...but I lived. Cassie ended up getting a headache to. I think it was just way to hot in that church. They really should of had the air on. But yeah. So yeah...I dunno what Im gonna do today. Its kinda to windy to tan...but I might try anyway. But I finally got to sleep in! It was 11 when I rolled outta bed. I was happy. LoL Pretty soon I'll be back to normal and it'll be 1 when I do. LoL Yeah...Well I have nothing else to ramble bout...
