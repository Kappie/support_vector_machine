The ceremony too play at sundown outside (It's in Nevada so it's really warm) and then after they exchanged vows we all went inside for the reception we ate, did a money dance, tossed the garder (one of the groomsmen caught it) and tossed the brides bouquet (I caught it :O) then I met some of Tony's (my now brother-in-law) cousins, they are great! They are around 15-18 and hilarious. Deanna is one I got along with the best, she's a sweetheart. ITALIANS ARE THE GREATEST! Before the wedding we all went over to Janisha's house and got out hair done and our make-up and hung out for 6 and a half hours with all the girls in the bridal party and related. It was great. And now here I am, in my sisters room, while she's driving to the airport to go on her hunnymoon with her hunny. We just got home frm the wedding. It was amazing. It made me realize, that I really don't need to be home, or around guys to have fun. I was talking to Carrie (one of my sister's brides maids) about being tall (she's 6'1) and we were talking about how people make rude comments and how she always has come backs for them, well at the wedding Carrie and I were standing next to each other (I'm 5'10 so not exactly short) and a guy comes up to us and says, oh look it's the twin towers, and carrie looks at him and says well these towers aren't going to fall, and walks off. It was awesome! haha Ciao bed time!
