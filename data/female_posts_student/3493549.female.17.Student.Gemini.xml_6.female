That's how I feel sometimes; that I wanna just fly away and do nothing or start a new life somewhere far far away. Sometimes, you just don't want to face things you inevitably have to face sooner or later. It's not like facing your fears, just some things you rather not dwelve into. Or some people you just do not want to face, people who misunderstand you, who misjudge you or who just love making your life a living hell. People you thought cared but then the moment you turn your back, they will be sticking daggers into you. People who are two-faced, acting so sweet in front of you but you never know what they're saying to others when you're not around. Then there are those who have single-handedly mastered the skill of sweet-talking, and you being the type who always believes everyone's an angel, fall for the sweet-talk. There are people who tell you they understand, care and love you but you never know, do you? It's very hard to trust people or see through their real intentions. You give them your trust and love but they abuse it or they do not return it. In the end, you realize you have to watch your own back and just wishing you could disappear from the world.
