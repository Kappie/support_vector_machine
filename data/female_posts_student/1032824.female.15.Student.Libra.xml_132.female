Fefe Dobson's music is sorta like a hodgepodge of Avril's, Michelle's and Lillix's. Rad! :) Her debut single "Take me away" is fab!! I've taken a liking to her eversince I saw her on TRL last year.   Anyways, the Campcraft competition at the Police Academy was damn exciting! We tried, although it wasn't good enough! Lol. We went there for the experience lah.. and I didn't regret joining it  at all . We completed our tent, flagstaff and gadget, but hahahaha, the tent looked quite.. yuck. Hehehe. 11 minutes went by like "WOOoSH!" man. My team and I were laughing away when the comp ended, while the other teams looked bery solemn. Some of em' were crying too =\ Oh yupp, I really appreciate the presence of some of our sirs! *Hugs!* Thanks for comin to support. Yamwen and Sir JH treat us to drinks oso. *Smoochies*  We went back to school for GOH training and Jess and I learnt to hold the flag pole thingy. It was quite fun, but I heard that the pole would be much much mucho heavier on the actual day. Woo! Awesome... Training ended at 2pm and for the first time Yann ming went out for lunch with us (seniors) haha.. damn lame man. 47 chromosomes. -.-"" HAHA. LOVE MY KIDS. Gonna start a "corn-knee club" soon. Til then, keep groovin lovers.
