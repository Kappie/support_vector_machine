Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup.  When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head When you feel the world shake from the words that are said   And I'm calling all angels. I'm calling all you angels   I won't give up if you don't give up   I need a sign to let me know you're here. Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear. I want a reason for the way things have to be. I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me  [Chorus] When children have to play inside so they don't disappear. And private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don't talk for years. And football teams are kissing Queens and losing sight of having dreams. In a world that what we want is only what we want until it's ours.. [Chorus x2] Calling all you angels"  train   calling all angels
