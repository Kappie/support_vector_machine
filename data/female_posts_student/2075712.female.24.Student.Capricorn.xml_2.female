Since Friday was my mom's 16 year anniversary with my stepdad, we went out to dinner yesterday...which I was honestly pretty nervous about since R and my mom have had tension between them for the past several years..Then at the last moment my brother cancelled which sucked cuz he is normally the one that makes  uncomfortable situations easier to deal with.  Anyways..we get to the restaurant and had to wait cuz my mom got lost on the way there..and R was getting very nervous and annoying.  I was so happy with the outcome...they actually got along very well !!  It was even, what some may call "fun".  After dinner we met Janice, Hugo, and Lui at Starbucks and went to city walk to try to get into any club or bar (which is pretty hard since neither R or I are 21 yet).  Anyways...R was being a funny guy and attempted several times to get into the same place even though they already told him several times that he was not old enough. To make a long story short we used Hugo and Janice's ID's to get in...and it was probably the whole adventure that made it so much more fun.  To top it off...there was no drama, which happens sometimes with my group of friends when there is alcohol involved.  Now it's Sunday and I had only 3 hours of sleep and I'm a little hungover...and I still have homework to do so I better get to that...today sucks.
