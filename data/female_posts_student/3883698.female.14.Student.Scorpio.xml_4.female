"Do you like the polka dots on my shoes?" "See that girl? I gave her that bruise!" Phones hanging from cloths around their necks Most wear braces and refuse to wear their specs Having sex before they grow hairs in weird places Fifteen tons of makeup on their faces Too many townies on this earth Destined to be idiots and losers from birth
