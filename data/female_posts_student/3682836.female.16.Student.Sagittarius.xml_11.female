I wish that everything imaginable that sucks in life didnt have to happen to my family. I wish I could see you more too.. But now... thats just not a option is it? I hope that everything will be okay for you, I'll always be there to help you when everything starts happening to you. I hate to think about my future without you. Getting married with no mom to help me, College without you to talk to, just my life in general without one of my best friends. I cant deal with death  I hope I never have to. I love you no matter what. Love, Ashly.
