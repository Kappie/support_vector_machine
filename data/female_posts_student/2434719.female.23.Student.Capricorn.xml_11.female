(i havn't seen her since lsat year so it's been a few months). so first she's telling me about how much spot loves my dad, and how funny it is cuase spot was just like me... she waits at the door for him to come home from work... she freaks out when he gets there and won't leave him alone... BUT, the best part, is my dad is doing the same things he did to me.... he won't be mean to her, or discipline her, cause he's afraid she'll be mad at him :). how funny is that? so mom's the bad guy again, heh heh. he won't even take her to get her shots!  it's great...  anyways, so this is the funny part. she tells me that she keeps accidently calling her sugar (our cat of 16 years who died about two easters ago). so she tells me, maybe spot IS sugar, reincarnated. i told her i didn't think so, becuase they have totally different personalities...  but she says, well, that's the POINT of reincarnation, to better yourself with each life... now maybe sugar is friendly.  how can you argue with that?  i laughed really, really, really hard though.   INTERVIEW TOMORROW. HOUSTON TOMORROW. YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!!!!
