This is the first post in my blog (well, duh) so if it sucks, don't complain. I'm not too good at this stuff (duh again).    I've created this thing for the sole purpose of being able to say that I own a blog. Yup. Not really any reason at all. No, wait, I'm bored, AND felt like having a place to go on and on about random things. Oh gods, I'm booooored. And angry. And depressed. I need a new hobby. Or a gameboy. Or both. But noooooo, my parents won't buy me a gameboy, or a game console of any kind! I'm lucky to have PC games. So I'm saving up to buy a gameboy. Which is harder than it sounds. You see, with an allowance of 10 dollars a month and the only other cash gaining opportunity being babysitting my little sister, I have to save up for a long time to get enough money to do anything with. Sure, I guess I should feel thatkful I live in a family that is well off and such, but oh well. I don't care. I don't FEEL very thankful at all. And my life SUCKS. Sure, it could be worse. I could be kicked out of the house and have to move in with the telletubbies. But it'd be pretty hard for it to get much worse short of a nuclear explosion nearby or something like that.   People don't make sense. I try so hard to fit in sometimes, I really do, but no matter what I do I just can't. I know I'm not like them. They know it too, and hate me for it. Well, that's how they act. I really don't have a clue what they really think about me. But their actions speak of disgust, of anger. I can't belong to this world. I don't know how to cope with so many things that life throws at me, and it's cost me so much. I'm beginning to think it's cost me my sanity.  Am I sane? Is this reality of mine some twisted path that should never be used? Is it 'wrong' to think this way? Even if it is, I cannot help it. I cannot change too many things about myself. There are so many things about me that I have no control over. And it seems I will never be able to control them. Yet all the other people around me can manipulate them flawlessly. Why does the world seem so alien through my eyes? It's the only one I've ever known, but is it fake?  Death. My biggest desire. I crave it's cold grasp, to be released from this shattered vessel and disappear into non-existence, where there is no pain. I want my life to be ended, and I want to be the one who ends it. And yet, I cannot. Something is holding me back from it. Fear. How ironic, that the only one preventing me from reaching my greatest desire is myself. My fear of pain keeps me from my death. Fearing pain is a human adapting, made to prevent us from potential danger. But this danger is what I WANT. I need the consequence of that action- after all, it is the only reason I would even consider the pain.  And so I live to see yet another day. Time passes strangely here in my own universe. A minute can seem like an eternity, while forever can pass like a second. So I don't know how long I've been isolated. Perhaps I am immortal and have lived for ages, or perhaps my existence hangs by a single thread and at any moment I could vanish. But I do not know. How can one know such things about themselves? Is it just me who is oblivious to fate, or do others know what will happen to them in the future? I suppose I shall never know. This illness keeps me locked inside myself, so that I can never escape to catch a glimpse of the world outside my cell. I seem to be spiraling downwards in a Maelstrom that I cannot stop. But what am I falling into? I cannot tell if this is insanity or sanity that I am approaching so quickly, but it seems that I will reach it soon, no matter what it is.  Is this real? Is my life a dream, a fantasy world created by who knows what? How I wish this was all superficial, that it never really happened. But how can I know? Even if I found out what this world is, it would probably be just another lie someone's using to manipulate me. Somehow I know that, even if this is a lie, it would change nothing. Even if I discovered this life wasn't real, I couldn't do anything about it. Why should I seek the truth when knowing it would not allow me to do anything about it?  Right now, I take things day by day, not thinking about tomorrow. For if I tried to think of the future, it would probably overwhelm me. I try not to consider the things that have the power to bring my world crashing down around me, because I do not know if there is any other world I could live in.
