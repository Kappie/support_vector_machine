Go figure. It was a really nice day outside, but the sky has sadly lost its sheen.  I'll probably still go out.  Lately for some reason, I've been appreciating the days that are especially pretty.  I never used to.  However, I am deeply dreading having to run outside in gym class when it starts to get hot outside.  I have it fourth period, which is both good and bad.  Good because at 10:30, it hasn't gotten that hot yet.  But bad because it's right in the middle of the day, and I have to pull myself together before bio.  Usually I calm down after ten minutes.  That'll be so much fun.  They say their trying to keep us in shape all semester with this A/B day business, but it's really just a way to torture us once a week.  Oh, and I love how affective the crunch tests are.  Yay, let's do 60 without stopping and then wait two months to do it again!  Smart the way they run things. Wow, I just went off on a complete tangent.  I should stop. When ever my mother goes off on tangents, I say to her, "Stop, you're being like a stand-up comedian rambling like that."  But she only takes it as a compliment.
