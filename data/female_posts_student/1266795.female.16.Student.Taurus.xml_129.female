(Haha... $27 bucks doesn't get much, but it does get some nice birthday gifts for Janice!)  I received my AP World History scores in the mail today, too. I got a 4, which, although I wanted a 5 at the beginning of the year, is great, considering how incredibly crappy my essays were. Answering all but one question on the multiple choice seemed to have helped.  "I've been rejected...twice!"
