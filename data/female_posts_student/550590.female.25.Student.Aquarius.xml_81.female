Christy definitely needs to come up to visit more often.  Saturday was a day for massive reorganization and cleanliness.  I bought new automatically dispensing dishes for the dogs when I was at Sam's club supposedly grocery shopping.  Then it was chinese food in a box in a boat (don't ask) for dinner and then a night of sheer debauchery at Alligator Rocks.  The green eyes and long hair must really be doing something because I kept getting smiles all night.  Lindsay's cousin, Greg, (blonde hair, blue eyes, probably known by-name by the receptionist at the gym) was especially attentive.  I vaguely recall an offer for a kiss at one point during the evening.  Ah, beer, the social lubricant.  Then it was off to Denny's to "sober up" with greasy cheese fries and then to bed to dream sweet dreams of the fun I'll be having next week when I'm NOT in Florida, much less Gainesville.  Today I got to hear Ryan on the radio (yay!) and my parents came up to trade computers and pick up the dogs.  Definitely need more weekends like this one in the future.  It's so nice not to have to do the chasing for once.  Sigh.  If only I didn't have to go to work in the morning. :(
