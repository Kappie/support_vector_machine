We're leaving in about an hour...  ...And I just got out of the shower (read:not dressed yet), I haven't packed at all yet, and I'm still not sure what I am going to wear tomorrow... Plus I just painted my toenails, and they are still wet...  ...Maybe I should hurry up and get ready... Joanna is picking me up at 12:30...  ...See you tomorrow or Wednesday!
