In addition, there is this one restaurant I have never been to, but it sounds interesting... it's called Straits, and I think it is pretty expensive, but it's supposedly asian-thai-american fusion. hella crazy. But, I would give it a shot. They have a location in Santana Row, but I am not sure what the prices are. Hmm.  Jan 24 works for me...  although by that time I may have no money, heh, but we will see. Muahahah!
