Another great time indeed.  He recapped it all already on his blog so if you're  that  interested you can check it out over there.  He's the bestest though.    In other news, we rescued a 12 yr old cocker spaniel from the  urlLink Elmsford Animal Shelter  in Elmsford, NY.  He has an absolutely sweet disposition and for a 12 yr old dog he's got a lot of life in him and the cutest lil puppy trot I've ever seen!  He is already making friends with the cats, and our other pup, Sahara.  Though we may not get to spend that time with him as he is quite old, at least he won't have to spend the rest of his days in a cage waiting for someone to adopt him.    I know everyone loves puppies and kittens, but there are a lot of older pets out there who need love too and would make AWESOME pets (sometimes better than the babies 'cause they're already trained and what not).  They're just as loyal and sweet and calm so they wont destroy your house and many of them still have lots of years of love and nuzzles to give you.  Just something to think about.  Also if any of you guys are in the area and looking you should DEFINTILEY check out E.A.S., 'cause they have a really big selection and are really helpful with the adoption/transition process.  Also if you have any old comforters, blankets, towels, cleaning supplies or really anything useful, rather than throw them out, think about donating to a local animal rescue agency, its expensive to care for all of these pets with out consistent funding and knowing you helped the lil furries will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.
