"excuse me, do you have a dollar you can spare, i need money to take a taxi home" lol i made two bucks in like 5 minutes, but then i couldnt get anyone to give me any money. i got michael to go ask for money with me while leo and vito waited at hooters. we asked for "change for a phone call." some guy told me that i could use his cell phone, so i called my room number and pretended to tell my mom to pick me up lol. after like half an hour we got our 5 bucks.
