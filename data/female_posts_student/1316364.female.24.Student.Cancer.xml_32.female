I had to send a message to Jesse through our FSG Liason SPC Kingsley, and have him send a message to someone on Jesse's end and give him the message. I hated having to give him the news that way but it was the only way I knew how. Two days later Jesse left the states. His official 1st Day was Sunday March 14th so start counting the days.  I had a great visit with him in Texas and almost wish it never had ended. I got a really nice picture of Jesse in his uniform, without firearm, and we had a great time being together and going out to dinner, and several other meals, with Danielle, David and Abigail Barber. I haven’t heard from Jesse since last Thursday, but that is to be expected since they are now in a new time-zone and are eleven hours ahead of us. He is going to be stationed somewhere in Kuwait. All I can do is wait for his call. in the meantime, I also manage to get sick as well, so once I was raring to go back to work and school I managed to catch something and have been home ever since. My bosses seem to be understanding and told me not to rush a return... but I guess it all takes time, any way....  ....I wrote a poem today:  How much more can I take? What am I supposed to do? When things happen like they have… Who can I turn too? When I cry at night,  My pillow holds the tears. When I need to scream and shout, Who will listen to my fears? I know I am not alone, My family and friends are here,  But it’s my Husband who I miss,  It’s him who wipes my tears. He takes away my fears,  And holds me close and tight. It’s him I want, not a damp pillow, To hold close to me at night.
