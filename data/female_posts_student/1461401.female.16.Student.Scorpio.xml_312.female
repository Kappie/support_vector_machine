It was an awesome night, but unfortunately, there have been few since then. Amber has gone to college, and only comes home every once in a while. She is one of my very best friends. *gags* Oh god that sounds corny. I feel like I should be wearing pom poms on my head and giggling while I scream BFF AND BUBBLE GUM BUDDIES! YAY! no.  just no.   I loves me some waffles. I misses me some amber.
