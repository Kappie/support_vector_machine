Went with Mark to do an inspection of a Indian restaurant on the high street, found another place where I will not be eating !!  Maggie if you make it here in Aug you may not get fed after all !!  Spent most of the afternoon messing around on the computer and my work e-mail( don't ask for the addy as I only use it for work stuff)  Spent a while talking to Maggie and Wolf on the MSN, it was likewe could have been round the kitchen table at uni!! strange  I'm off to watch the TV for a while then over to see Dawn, she has keys for me so I can feed her cat and hamster when she goes on hol next week, not fair she gets the red hot sun and I get her cat !!
