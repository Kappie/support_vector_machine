Last night I ended up going to the gym around 4- I really made the best of the workout to make up for my half-a-bagel-eating sins earlier in the day.  Christy was insisting that one of the gym employees was giving her dirty looks, but, as it turns out, the man just recognized her from a tennis class that she and her brother took last summer.  Next time we'll ask this guy to show us the ropes on the mystery circuit since we don't know how to work any of those machines.  Okay, we actually just haven't figured out how to adjust them to our dwarfish height.  That's why I always ask Christy to go ahead of me on the machine circuit, so when I get there the machine will already be adjusted. Christy and I had soup and salad @ Coco's and had to drive back to drop off a shirt for a friend, who ended up not being at Coldstone's after all.  We finally went back to her house to watch the Second Season of Law  Order but kept getting interrupted, so we went out for coffee.  The shop was closed, so we went to Blockbuster to price "50 First Dates", which was out the 15th.  It was $22, which is ridiculous compared to watch she could get on ebay in a month, so we went back to my place and started watching Rush Hour and baking a cake.  Meanwhile, my roommate finally called... It turns out Ivana is from Yugoslavia and lived in Germany a large portion of her life, and moved to TX when she was 16. She speaks several languages, likes to play the guitar, and plans to do Int'l Studies and Comm. @ AU.  She's a liberal, thank goodness- I don't know which of us was more relieved the other was a lefty.  Sounds like we have a lot in common, which is excellent.  I know that your roommate doesn't have to be your best friend, but it will be nice having a friend to "come home to" each night.  Ooo- also, she's a night owl, too, which might mean I don't have to be quiet at night. Today, I'm shopping and swimming with Debbie, then I bring my mom to pick up her car (after an oil change, 1500 miles late, great mom) and pick up Renee.  My new student Alissa will be at 3:00 @ TIS, and then I have Tikva @ her place at 5:30.  Lots of dead space, so I think I'll keep reading Conover's "Sing-Sing" book- fascinating stuff. Tonight I've got the gym again, then working on the leadership program app. for the SPA @ AU.  Tomorrow morning, more dets.
