Maybe, i think, if I'm so confused about relationships and mi feelings and everything, then maybe I'm not ready to have a relationship. I feel ready, but maybe God's trying to tell me in a way i'm not. My Mum seems to be holding onto me tighter right at this moment as well, but strangely enough its the time i most need her to let go. Cuz im growing up now, but I don't know if she can accept that yet, because in her eyes i seem young, but to me im an old soul, and i feel experienced, although in theory im probably not.   I often wonder, the age old question, what is the meaning of all this. Life, in general. Like sumtimes it just seems like a roundabout, sumtimes it seems like a joy, pure unadulterated joy, and you feel like your flying, riding on the wings of life, but sumtimes, more often than not, it is sad, so incredibly sad that the emotional pain is so bad that you can actually physically feel it. I mean is this what life is all about, is this what God wants for us? To experience so many contrasting emotions, then die and join him? I often wonder...
