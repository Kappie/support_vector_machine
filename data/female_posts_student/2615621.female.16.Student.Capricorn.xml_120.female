I enjoy my church time a quiet experience with an organ, they didnt have an organ! they had freakin DRUMS! The people yell, the preacher cries, he tells u to put ur hands in the air..so i pretended to look at my nails...he makes u touch people..i didnt like it one bit. im shocked my dad goes there! i mean, he was raised in a quiet church! oh well..im not dissin it, i mean, go to church, thats what matters, but idk..it was too new for me. Its a beautiful buliding though, its like $30million worth. It seats over 22,000 people and has a balcony and all...its cool, but wow..and its an hour and a half long! And its like worse than church camp. i didnt like it one bit. But hey, then again, it was "gods house" but he must have moved..cuz thats not how i remember "gods house". but anyways...AMEN!!!!! haha omg..i was terrified! but..hey for some people thats their thing. and u know what, they talked about how bad gays are, and then they said "we're all unique and god made us that way so we should love each other for their uniquness. and i was like..WTF? u just said people with differences were bad?! lol ok...whatever. im all for gays. *rainbows and butterflies* cuz i mean, not everyone in this world is christian, and what if there was a religion who said "u gotta be gay" and we made it so gays couldnt get married..does that mean we dont let freedom of relgion happen?? umm...whatever. Anyways, i think the chour director at that church is gay..he looks like an older clay akien or whatever. seriously. Gays might wanna go to church too..so u know..gosh i hate this whole thing about gays!! just let them be!! its only like 10% of the population! Its not like the world is comin to an END! ughh..pisses me off.   *much love*
