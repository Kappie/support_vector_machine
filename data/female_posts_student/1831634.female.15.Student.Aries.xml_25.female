And now I'm wondering what ning would say if she knew that those were my first thoughts of the day.  (actually, I know what she's gonna say.  -__-;;)  so anyways, all I've gotten done all weekend was my next chapter for OMM.  I wanna finish socsem questions today, as well as my one life lesson.  hmm.... and then maybe if I finish ALL my homework today, I can go to the DMA tomorrow!  =D  +EDIT+  alright, DMA is closed on mondays.  there goes that.  psh.  ++sunny
