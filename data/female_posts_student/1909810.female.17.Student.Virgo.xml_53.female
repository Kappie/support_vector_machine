It's kind of sad that one test decides my mood for the rest of the day.  Although I have been generally happier the last couple of days which is a plus, go me.  I'm excited for the break,  I really need a break from school.  And an aunt is coming the day after christmas, I'm EXTREMELY excited for that.  I really should be studying for an english test, and finishing my book, but eh, whatever.  We have a tree.  It's shorter than usual, but it's a nice tree.   I'm not exciting.
