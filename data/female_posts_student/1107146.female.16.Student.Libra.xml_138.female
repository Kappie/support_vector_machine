I kind of woke up and didn't, I was in "between times", the scattered, minus-human zone between sleeping and wakeness for a long while, floating in sleep and anti-substance, for what seemed like hours. In the morning I was blinking sleep and rubbing watering eyes, and for some reason knew that I had not slept at all last night, for whatever primal human reason I have not stumbled upon. I did not, and in front of this computer I feel as a mouse feigning a bit too much before the wheels of a dump truck.  Another little tap of caffeine at break this morning. It's a shame I have all these excess Cokes, they're giving me an excuse to drink them at any time...which reminds me why I didn't sleep last night. They were  calling  me with such cute, pert, uppity voices, how could I resist?  I'm trying to stave estranged looks from Brittany at my left, who is busy reading backlogs from Saturday (the Invincible one, the Charlie Brown one first, and pretty soon she'll reach the Hope and Day posts).  All for now.
