Why couldn't we just write a new song? *cry* I have so many crappy little pop ideas waiting to surface!  Well, yeah. Um. Hmm. I'm glad that he acknowledged it and all even today, the day, uh, after. O wait, he didn't. Hahah. Sigh. A masterful letdown, I tell you what.  Well yeah again, and now it's four days and I don't think this letter is going to do it. I don't really write letters, I write stories when I do write...and this one is pretty much sounding like a story. The English is WAY too good, they probably won't believe that I wrote it. And I hate to be boastful, but it's really elevated shit...very educated and collected, almost colloquial at times. I mean really, who uses "lamentations" or "malaise" anymore. Lamentations, the Bible, grated. But "malaise," OLD OLD OLD. And I used it. And I can't do much about it now. So I give.  Let's all do a rain dance and hope to lordy we get out of school tomorrow! Hurray!
