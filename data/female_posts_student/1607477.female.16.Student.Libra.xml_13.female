(sorry bout that lindsay). ...neways she threw it out the window and the guy in the car next to us looked kinda mad. oh well. neways we got to her house and i met addison and michael (ew). lol addison is cool!  heehee!  but neways michael was NOT so cute. dont date him. unless you having missing teeth and dont mind guys with missing teeth and ACNE! if you do then go for it. he could be nice maybe. i duno. im just shallow like that.  ...ok well i better get off this bc its supossed to be lindsays mind not mine and im the smart one so im making her look smart and i cant do that. lol. neways ...sorry for getting on this without permission lindsay! and i wont EVER EVER do it again... i was just really bored and when you were doing the other ones at my house it looked like sooo much fun so i had to try but im not lazy to make my own and i dont really care to. but it wont ever happen again. carry on... bye SaMaNtHa!
