And i could barely walk? ya well right now, its double that. i woke up this morning around6:30 and went up stairs and just lied on my floor. Even that was killing me.I couldn't walk, sit, lie down. I wanted to screamtil someone just put me out of my misery.I was crying and after about an hour of that it got worse and i couldn't handle it and i started throwing up from the pain. ah god. and now everyone else went out to eat lunch, and i stayed home.  And again, to add to my interesting life, i'm not only anorexic, or bulimic ( long story)- the doctors aren't sure yet- why dont they just frikin ask ME!! i'm neither. i eat like a horse i embarrassed the hell out of myself today when i was sure i heard my parents talking about me and what i heard i was like WHAT!WTF!OMG! so i ran in there and was like, I'm NOT PREGNANT!!!... and they all kinda stared at me, and were like, gena do you have something to tell us.... That is one word you dont say in my house, much less boyfriends. and since to my dad one goes in hand with the other, you might as well not say anything. At all. So i was hearing things, and my family things theres either something seriously wrong with me, or i'm acting guilty about something. tho it was probably just the 4 Ibuprophen i took on an empty stomach. But i'm feeling much better now :) and i'm going to walmart to buy hair color :) : ) and then i have to go buy my brother a birthday present, which i'm sure that the store doesn't carry, so now i'm screwed.  I cleaned him van yesterday. it was really fun. ( i was in a weird state...) and from 1-6 i washed all three cars. Waxed and buffed my bro's 92' Villager. vaccummed it, cleaned and organized it. And i dont know if you guys have seen a college guys car...but damn... scary shit yo.. But i was really proud. and now he wants to pimp out his Van. Either apply for the TV show Pimp My Ride, or someother like Tricked Out... idk.... my grandparents just gave him $500...so, all hell will break loose. alright. i have to go toodles.
