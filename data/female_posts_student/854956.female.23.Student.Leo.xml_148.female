Everything is going pretty well... yesterday was my last day of work til about 6 January... and we had a small number of kids (as we imagined it would turn out).  It was sorta sad to me... I've gotten so used to being around these kids day in and day out... and I really did think that I would be SO HAPPY to have a break... but it turns out, I'm really going to miss not seeing them for a few weeks.  And yesterday we had so few kids, that Greg said he was going to send a couple of us home early.  So, I decided since I got an hour of pay for the Christmas party we had I would volunteer to leave early.  So, I left at 4:45, and the point where I realized I would miss the kids was when about 20 kids ran over begging me not to leave early.  "Please, Miss Kelsie, stay even though you don't have to."  It's difficult to explain to a group of 6 and 7 year olds the rules we have about not being able to stick around when we're off the clock.  I had the same group of kids for the past 3 weeks (because none of us wanted to bother making up new chores and rotation schedules after Thanksgiving break to now)... so, we got REALLY attatched... and I had 3 girls from my group hugging me so tightly...  I really felt appreciated the past week as I got several gifts from kids and their parents for the semester.  We got several "to the staff" gifts, and there were about 5 parents/kids that fixed up individual gifts for us.  You really feel rewarded by all of this...  Anyhow, I need to stop typing now because I have to finish cleaning up and packing and all to go to Austin today... I'll post more after I return...
