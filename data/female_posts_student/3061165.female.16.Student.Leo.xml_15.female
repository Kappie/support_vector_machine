Well, the listening compre's not too bad. I compared my answers with my sis's(she's taking it too though she's sec 3 cuz higher chinese). We have two questions with different answers! The rest is the same. Well, hope my listening marks will pull me up instead of the other way round! It's soo cool~ It's broadcasted from the radio(instead of playing a stupid CD or tape then hearing from other classrooms different timings and get distracted ^^") all over singapore!  After the listening, we went to the school's bus stop bball court. Had a few matches that drained me out almost totally. Not bad lor, had lots of fun! Today more people went to play basketball(chunseng, ivanS, yiren, yipeng, elita, po tiong, woon han, zhanyuan, guowei and me), so more fun(though had to play full-court matches)! After that I went home and had my lunch(curry + bread + curry potatoes + a bit of rice). Was soo full! Oh, I borrowed comics from Sai Lam today at school also! KYO.. It's kinda like Rurouni Kenshin and like a copycat to me. But it's nice anyway, as the story continues... And most of all, it's free(i borrowed, remember?)! So why not? ^^"  Hee.. Joking only... Now back to the fourth book Harry Potter reading. For those who've already read it(even the 5th), don't laugh at me k? I'm trying to concentrate here! Haha, no lar, at least I start reading ritex? Better den nothing. Signx off now... All de best for those who took their listening today! =)  P.S: This post was posted on Saturday, 4 Jul 04(yesterday) but I reposted it due to some sort of error in de blogspot. I reckon it's fixed now so it's okay... ^^    Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire   Quote: When you play, play hard; when you work, don't play at all.
