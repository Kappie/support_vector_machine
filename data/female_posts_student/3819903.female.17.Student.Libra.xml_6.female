Woke up, Nicole came over to give me my graduation/going off to college present...A PELLOW.(note: Nicole has a speech inpediment...and she has a hard time saying I's, ex: Pell=Pill, Melk= Milk, Pellow=Pillow) This pillow was so cute! It had purplely colors on the front and on the back was a collage of different pictures of group gatherings...you know, a pillow of memories, per se. So now all i have to do is find something as cool as that to give to all my buddies before I leave! Damn, it's going to be hard!   Work--Worked with Ann for the second day in a row, and didn't talk to her...again. I read Angels and Demons the whole night (slow night!). I read 100 pages in 5 hours...while working! Pretty freaking amazing...and Pretty Amzing BOOK!   Q: What happens every Tuesday?!   A: Nip/Tuck Night of Course!  Ginny's House to pool it up, and watch nip/tuck...this week we did! Played in the pool for about 15 minutes--admiring Kyle's Hot Olympic Bod!--and then got out to watch our gruesome show. This episode was good! The "life coach" is seducing every part of the family (not the mom), the son, the father, and the biological father! Freaking Hystarical...she's such a whore! Oh well, don't think I'll be swimming next week!   Snuck out of Ginn's to play some poker at Joe Jr.'s House. It was Jr., Justin, Nicole, Sam, Joe Sr., and I playing some Hold 'um! So Sam was forced home within the first 10 minutes of play...so it was just the five of us for a while, all holding our own--no leader yet. So then when the old man went up to get some shut eye, we divyed up his chips, and played with the four of us. We started at 10:30, and ended around 12:35. Nicole, of course, has to obey her "elementary school curfew," -as Joe would call it- and was out by Midnight. So the three of us battled it out! By now, I had a monsterous lead into the last half hour of play. Joe: wasn't so lucky with the chips tonight! He was out first. Justin and I played for a decent amount of time! We started this one hand, ante being 40, and I had Ace, 7, suited. So I bet alot (mainly because it was getting late...and I had the chips to do it!), about  600  i would say. So the flop is down: Ace Diamonds, 3 hearts, 5 diamonds.  Ok, looking pretty damn good so far ...but the ace, 7 suited...were spades.  Whatever..I was like the pair of Aces!  So the turn is pulled out...7 of diamonds!  Amen to that...lets add another 100 chips into the massive pot thats building!  And the river...a 3 of diamonds. So I'm sitting there, content and confident in my betting, pretty sure I was going to take it all home, and wim for the second time in a row...a Justin has a Flush! AHHHH No Way!?  I lost 600 bucks worth of Chips!  Oh boy! So now i go from taking a commanding lead, to dumping it away! So now...Justin Has an even lead with me! I was getting some pretty good hands now...but in the middle of my loss...Kevin Gams gives me a jingle! So maybe I was a little thrown off! he asked me out on a date tomorrow--Dinner and Bourne Supremacy! Sounded good...Damn Good, So I'm now set for a date tomorrow! Hell yeah! Ok back to the story! Overall...Went all in..And lost! So I took second...and Joe said he was really impressed! He thought I "just had beginners luck the first time...but i held my own tonight!"  So off to bed now...Hittin balls tomorrow, and a Date to attend! ooh Lala! Goodnight Friends!
