He had been battling cancer for (I take a guess at) 3-4 years.  First he had skin cancer... then he got  urlLink lymphoma  (I think that's how it's spelled).  Anyhow, my Grandma had just broken her ankle at Thanksgiving that year... so she came to San Antonio to have corrective surgery.  My Grandpa was getting in home treatments at that time, so my Dad went to stay and take care of him.    I still remember that day.  I stayed home sick because I had the stomach flu.  Around 5ish, my Mom decided she'd better call over there because she just had a feeling.  My Great Aunt Mary answered the phone, and was screaming about my Grandpa... when my Mom first told me that my Grandpa had shot himself... my first reaction was "In the leg or something?!  Is he okay?!"  Never did I think that my Grandpa would commit suicide.  It wasn't like him at all.  He (before his cancer got bad) had such a love of life.  Anyhow, as if that weren't traumatic enough, my Mom, Uncle Scott, and I went there to the house to be with my Dad that night and then go to the funeral home the next day so things could be set up.  So usually, I hate staying the night at that house... it makes me think of that night.  I didn't even sleep, I just laid there listening to my Dad tell my Mom chunks of what happened.  How he first walked in the room... and saw my Grandpa leaning against the headrest.  And how he just thought he had bumped his head when he was trying to stand up... or that he had passed out.  And then when he got over there, he realized everything by what he saw.  That's the only time I have ever seen or heard my Daddy cry.  Ever.  Anyhow... that's my sad story.  This is the thing that will haunt me on Dec. 1 for the rest of my life.      urlLink  postCount('1Dec2002');
