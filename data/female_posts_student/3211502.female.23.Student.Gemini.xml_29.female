We're planning on hitting that up Thursday night, but that's not really the point of this entry. Anyways, after talking to Anita, it finally hit me that there were probably tons of free events like that going on in the city. Yeah, I know, it took me a while to realize this, but, as you all know, I'm kind of slow like that. So, I immediately started looking up all the NYC sites that I know of and found some pretty good listings of summer events. So, maybe this summer won't be so boring after all. Thank god.  In particular, on the NY Metro website, I found a listing for a reading by Helen Fielding. For all of you who are unaware of who Helen Fielding is (shame on you!), she is the author of Bridget Jones's Diary and its sequel, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. I love these books like crazy. They're really what started me on my whole obsessive chick lit phase. I decided that it was definitely something I wasn't going to miss. Thankfully, I was able to convince Anita to join me, so I wasn't all by my lonesome in Barnes and Nobles.  The reading was pretty cool. Helen Fielding read a couple of chapter of her new novel, Olivia Joules and her Overactive Imagination (or something like that), and did a Q session. Her new book really isn't quite as good as the Bridget Jones series in my opinion, but it's still quirky. Anyways, after the reading and the Q, Helen Fielding did a book signing. I ended up buying copies of all of her books and had her personalize and sign all of them: "To Irene... Helen Fielding." Yes, I know, I'm crazy.  Side note:  One of the girls who asked a question was apparently on American Idol. Helen Fielding recognized her as "Scooter Girl."
