I was so excited for him to come over and all and he did and so did liz and lauren and we had a great time and did your normal boy with girl hang out stuff..yeah we made out. was it good?? not at the beginging but he did improve once he let off on the tounge haha. He went off and told his friend josiah that he liked me A LOT and i was exactly what he was looking for in a girl and all that good stuff...but at the same time im thinking "do i really wanna be with lorne??". I decided..uh...maybe not as much as i thought. IDK. IM FUCKING CONFUSED of exactly how i feel. I dont want anything too serious, yet, i've been wishing and hoping to find a serious bf. So, theres lorne...yeah...mr. what i thought was gonna be all perfect and wonderful..and then theres me..not knowing what i want to do. Then, i start talking to one of my good guy friends Todd and we've always kept in touch since he moved schools and stuff and i think i like him. Ive known him since the 7th grade and lorne for only a little over a week...idk it could just be something im going through. I want to have that so called "freedom" to date around, but then again...i've ALWAYS had that "freedom" and have never been too tied down recently. So, i tell josiah all this stuff on my mind and im flat out honest cuz i know it will get back to lorne..and it did..and joe didnt tell me he told lorne so lorne calls me and we hardly talk..i didnt know what to say. the call was 5mins, most are at least an hour. I feel like the biggest bitch. He was so excited about there being an "us" and i went and ruined it at the last minute, its not totally over and its not ruined..just slowed down and put on hold. I dont know what to say or do next around him. We had plans to go somewhere tomorrow...we'll prob go, since i have to give him his dvd back..damn why did he forget it? I dont know what i want..everything seemed to come so natural with him and all..i have no fucking clue. i say fuck it all. i want a bf sooo bad one minute and cry about being single, then i ruin it for myself. my nickname might as well be Chickenshit jr.
