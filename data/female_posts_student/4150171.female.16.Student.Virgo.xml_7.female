Now I really don't know exactly wat I will be saying in this, theres nothing really exciting about anything going on in my life, I do have some funny friends and a crazy ass family.... but i will mostly be writing this because I have nothing but free time until August 23rd, Which also happens to be my birthday!          Today was Gay, it was my second to last day of working, Thank God! I hate my job, but sometime its fun working with my cousins and aunt, but its not fun when it seems like Im there personal Bitch.. which is all the time. After work, I returned katelynns belongings that I had so long and chilled at the Krahn House awhile. Its one place I love going, what can I say.. I love the Krahns. Then I went to the Raske Household to eat her puppy chow, but I was dissappointed that Jeffrey wasn't there and left. I think I have an obsession with Sarahs little brother, hes so cute, esp. when he calls me CMitch.            So i think Im gonna go to bed soon, MY LAST DAY of work is tomorrow and Im getting excited!
