Never thought it could    Happen to me yet    In this moment all my fears are gone    Trying to forget    The way I felt before    I have found you I don't need much more      Oh please let this moment last til forever   Let's just stay...      In this moment    Everything's changed in my life   In this magic    My world is now in your eyes       Standing here with you    Feel so different now    Can't remember what just happened cause    You are what I've searched for    My life's now complete    I hope you know    Just what you mean to me      Oh please let this moment last til forever   Let's just stay       In this moment    Everything's changed in my life    In this magic   My world is now in your eyes      Is this really real    Or is it just a dream   I don't care   I know I'm here right now   The past just flies away   The truth is all so clear   From this moment    You're all I hold dear       Oh please let this moment last til forever   Let's just stay       In this moment    Everything's changed in my life   In this magic   My world is now in your eyes       Repeat, End...     Lovely long day today, however, I am too tired to explain myself. Recommendations for today are Catwoman, The Bourne Supremacy, and Studio Movie Grill theatres. Gods, I tell you. Oh and I almost got into a car wreck... but that's another story.  Last night here...  sad.  :( God, I'm going to miss these guys. We're currently watching three of the most hyperactive kids I've ever met, who have destroyed  every room  except mine in this house. Kelly just gave me a copy of Aladdin the book in French.  YAY !   You're home!  And it's happy! I can't wait to see you.  Je t'adore, mon ami.
