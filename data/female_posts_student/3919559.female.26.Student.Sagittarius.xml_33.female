The West Wing is probably my favorite TV show, even though I've never watched it in prime time and couldn't even tell you when it's on.  I get my fix from re-runs on Bravo and the Season 1 and 2 DVD sets.  So this is unfortunate, but I had heard the show was definitely on the decline after Sorkin had left.  I'd love to see it continue but not in a diminished state.  Plus I still have 3 "good" seasons to enjoy on DVD in the near future.
