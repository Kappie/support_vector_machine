Oh, first we went to Purdue, but we got so lost we missed the info session so we just drove around. It's in the middle of NOWHERE, but the campus is pretty! We got lost in Chicago, but eventually found our way. My mom is crazy. She'll be like, "Damn this shitbastards I hate you, this is all your fault, Allison, omg look at that building, it's so beautiful!" My mother is bipolar for reals. That night we had this HUGE meal and then went on a boat ride around the city and Lake Michigan. Chicago is so clean, it's unreal. It's a big city, but it still feels Midwestern. This boy on the boat kept talking to me and I was about to smack him and tell that kid to shut it! His sister kept grabbing him and it was weird, damn hicks from Kansas. The next morning we went to the Lincoln Park campus of DePaul... only to be at the wrong campus. So we took the L to the main campus. We walked in and there is this huge sign that says, "Welcome Allison Ansari" WHAT THE FUCK?! People kept coming in and looking at it, and I was completely embarrassed. It's weird to see your name on the big screen, not that that's what it was, but close enough. This Indian man walked us around. We went to their new housing project, shared by two other schools, and went on the longest ass tour around that shit. We met up with lots of other people and it took forever. The place was amazing, but I would never be put into that house, so why waste time? This mom asked, "Are there key cards for mothers? You know, so if mothers want to come in and check on stuff, they don't have to wait for their kids to come down and check them in and everything?" That kid had to have shit his pants, we all practically laughed in that lady's face. What a dick. My mom and I were like, "It's time to let them go, lady!" We started our drive home, and got lost a lot. Anna and I didn't have this many problems...9 hours later we got home, and that's about it.  So today I went to check out the Early November website. 1. Ace hasa girlfriend. 2. Jeff has a girlfriend. 3. Even though they're recording, they won't be touring for a long time and 4. Jeff is telling everyone to go out and listen to The Matches- therefore everybody will, and STOP IT, DAMNIT, THE MATCHES ARE MINE. I don't like to be possessive, but when I read that my blood started to boil. I was not the first Matches fan, and I won't be the last, but I think I'm a pretty good fan. By the end of the summer, I will have seen them five times, and Jon ALWAYS asks ME for drugs- that is saying something! AND they are nothing like The Early November, so those preppy kids are going to be all like, "OMG look at his [Shawn's] clothes and..." I'm just pissed. I don't know why, well actually, I do. I have to go to my dad's house tonight. And tomorrow, I was going to visit Drexel by myself, but now one of his friend's daughter is coming with me- I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO BABYSIT.  HAHA I just reread what I wrote about The Matches, damn I'm obnoxious. Sorry kids. But still... they're mine.  Now I probably won't be talking to you guys for a while. Dad's til Tuesday night 10 PM and then Cali 11 AM Wednesday morning. Talk to you kids soon. Peace.
