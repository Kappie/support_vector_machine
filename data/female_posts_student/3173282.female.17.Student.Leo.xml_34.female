I dunno if any of u have heard it but its a pretty song n i wish i had an acoustic guitar to play it on. But for those of you who have ever heard me attempt to play guitar, you would be so surprised. But i seriousyl spent like all day working on it so i know i'm a loser. I gotta start packing soon.  ;(  i dont want to, too much work. And i get a car for my birthday which is August 3rd in case any of you bitches were thinking about forgetting. Now you cant. I want money! Just kidding, what i really want is a 24 karat gold necklace with rims still spinnin with diamonds on them. straight thuggin! Buti think i already got enough *bling* to satisfy me. U know..... well, justin beats me i guess. By the way, where is justin? Did the tornado get him?? He's hiding somewhere today but i'll find him. Maybe later. I really wanna go to that Weird Al concert tomorrow night and see Rachel perform her magic gangsta-styyle. Haha, gotta get to that show!! fuckin weird ass al, yeeeaaah! Ok its late and i'm just rambling so i'm going to retire. No one reads this crap anyway cuz they already know its gonna be gay! Nighty night                                                   ilovepoprocks
