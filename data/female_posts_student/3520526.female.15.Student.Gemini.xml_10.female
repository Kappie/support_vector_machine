By now i'm probably infested with various childrens' deadly diseases, along with a few smashed foods in my face and hair, oh yes, and a few bruises on top of it all. Oh, how i love Camp :) Hey well i am at  loss for words, most likely becuase of my lack of alertness at the moment (which means that i should not be drving, since that, of course, would be dangerous...drivers ed is quite the learning spot). So anyways...going to go soak up the sun that has been gone for a while :) till we meet again
