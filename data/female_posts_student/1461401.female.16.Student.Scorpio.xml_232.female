I wish there was a real way to know what to do in these kinds of situations.  "so he would buy her gifts and kiss her hand to show he was for real. And she would take those gifts and kisses though just stringing him along. She knew about, those wooden boys. It's an empty love, to fill the void. Pinoccio, oh boy how your nose has grown, and he would cry out 'liar liar. I'll prove it to you.'"  Black was what I wore today and black is still my mood. I don't know what to think and I don't know what to do. There are no easy answers no no no no no no no easy answers no no not anymore no more easy answers now.
