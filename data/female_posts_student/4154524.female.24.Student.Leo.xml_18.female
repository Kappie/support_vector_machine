August 16, 2004...Here are my post-wedding thoughts:  1)I'll be honest...I used to think weddings were gross and scary....but this week has made me change my mind...I've upgraded "gross" to "yucky" and "scary" to "not so bad, I guess"... 2)best of luck to Pete and Mel...best of luck to me and Hugh Grant...I've loved you through 4 weddings..I've loved you through a funeral 3)Best of luck to my girlfriends and base Gagetown...."Be all you can be" 4)No matter how many beer you consume, Mark Abraham still looks wrong in a tight tank top (picture is available upon request)...sorry dude...no dice....nooo dice 5)Invite single women to a wedding and they go into heat 6)Vomiting is surprisingly less gross if everyone is doing it...but not even Kimp can make it sexy 7)We've finally reached the age where we're old enough to behave...gross...  Until next time...fuck y'all...
