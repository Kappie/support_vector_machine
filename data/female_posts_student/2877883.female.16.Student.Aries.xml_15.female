I think VHI follows me or something because they seem to always play these things when I had just talked/thought about them the day before.  It's because I'm so cool like that.  jk.  Anyways, well today has been lovely boring but I guess it's o to the k with me for today.  I am like half way done with my first history essay.  It's quite easy, so that's good.  I read a really long and extremely boring chapter in my otherwise fairly interesting book for history.  I've read 3 chapters of about the 10 I have to read.  Joy.  I'll probably read mostly in the car going to Connecticut on Thursday, though, which I'm sure will be a par-tay.    I was waken up at about 8 this morning, which I wasn't entirely happy about because I was way to tired to get up, so I just kind of lounged in my room until the "late" hour of 8:45.  Then I don't really remember what else I've done.  So, yeah, that was my summary of my altogether boring morning, enjoy.  I'm going to the movies later with Sar and other cool people and we are seeing "50 First Dates."  Par-tay on!    I realized this morning that Mischa Barton is way too tall and has quite gross teeth.  It was not a lovely realization.
