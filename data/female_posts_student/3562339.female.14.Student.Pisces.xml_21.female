There was perfect weather for the Lower Merion Graduation, though it was a bit hot.  It cooled down today (thank god) but it's like still really muggy out.  Had Chinese food for dinner.  Yummy in my tummy.  Heh heh.  Tomorrow is Friday at last!  This week has taken forever to go by.  It was like the longest week ever.  Every day this week has felt like Friday, but of course, they were just being evil and trying to trick me, and they were all fake Fridays.  Grrrrrr.  But tomorrow is a real Friday!  Yay!  Oh yes, and I figured out what Nikhil and Bernard were doing.  I'm pretty sure that they were playing a game where each would try and get the most high fives from people on the bus, since they were doing it today too, and they were counting the high fives.  It was kind of weird yesterday, cause they didn't start until my stop, so I was like, "What the fuck."  They tried again today, but yet again, I was like, "No," and got off of the bus.  Pssssh, whatever.  GIVE ME A COMMENT NOW GOD DAMNIT!!!  IF YOU DON'T, YOU WILL DIE A HORRIBLE AND PAINFUL DEATH IN THE NEAR FUTURE!  GOT IT?!  Heh heh...  ONLY 3 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu
