Mike hopped up bright and early to haul our old couch to the dump and pick up a small, new TV stand - one made from wood rather than particle board. He was supposed to return with a borrowed table saw, but failed, as his victim was not home. Instead, he busied himself ripping off the cupboard doors from the kitchen, while my mother and I drove into town to buy paint.  In the midst of all this, my auntie dropped by with my cousin, Chris. I had a very unpleasant few hours of barking directives and physically restraining the boys as they hit, pushed, kicked, wrestled over toys, and lobbed rocks at each other. Gavin decided that if Chris could screech like a Nazgul, he could, too. Charming. The overwhelming balance, however, was on Chris' side. He is so relentless with his boundary-pushing that Gavin became all but lost amidst the cries of "Chris, no! Put that down, Chris! No throwing, Chris! I said NO! Chris, you get back here!" and the like. Naturally, what do children do to get attention if all the focus is on the rotten kid? They behave rotten as well. It's a horrific cycle, and I dread it when my auntie comes over with Chris. Pity, I would really like to have warmer feelings for my wee cousin, instead of restraining the urge to punt him. (On a side note, my auntie bragged extensively about how he's talking in full sentences and having conversations now, and he demonstrated his brilliance by yelling "buh-buh!" a hundred times while running in circles.)  So tomorrow we paint the kitchen. I emptied out the pounds of plastic grocery bags we had guiltily stowed under the sink, and I generously donated them to the supermarket recycle bin, with a few giant roaches thrown in for good measure. The puging feels good, and already the living room is transformed by the absence of the Dreaded Orange Couch and the addition of a proper piece of furniture for the TV and stereo. Gavin expressed his appreciation of the arrangement by hauling down some couch pillows and lounging naked on the floor. The boy has good sense.
