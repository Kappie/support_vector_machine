Anyway I'm contemplating wether I should call somebody up and do something or to just sit here and do nothing. It wouldn't be so hard to decide what to do if I didn't live in a terrible city. I shouldn't say it's terrible. We don't have a lot of shootings or anything. It's terrible just because it's sooo boring. There's only 2 places to go: the mall and the movie theatre. I'll probably go to see Hero with my friends when it comes out on Friday. It looks like a pretty cool movie. It probably isn't quite as good as Kill Bill then again what movie is?  School orientation is tomorrow. We're actually getting our pictures taken that day too. I hate picture day. The 9th graders go to school at the regular time while everyone else goes to school at like ten thirty. What could be a better way to have us feel normal and fit in than to have us come two or three hours earlier than everyone else. That's about it for today. Bye =)   urlLink http://www.killsometime.com/Pics/Funny/GetPicture.asp?PictureID=106  hahahahahahah  BTW http://qtdiary.blogspot.com/  I wonder if this is actually his diary.
