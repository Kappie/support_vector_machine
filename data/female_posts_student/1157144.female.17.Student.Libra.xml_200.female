BEST OF LUCK!!!! kick some audition ass!   ok, here's a bigger announcement: because of my father's sporadic computer doings, i have had to change my screen name. it is now  cabala42  don't ask about the name unless you're bored ;) but yeah. my email is still the same as before, just new screen name. man, new screen name and new cell number... it's like i'm a new girl or somthing...  haha, sorry, just had a frappachino.... =high on caffine....= i have no idea what in the fuck i'm talking about.   but cabala42 really is my screenname now. really.
