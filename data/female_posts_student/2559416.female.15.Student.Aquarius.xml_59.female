Walk Just walk Don't talk Continue walking I know it hurts The chains are heavy Are they real or, did you make them? Mind tricks  Light... A little, simple but beautiful glimpse Light... Hope is back in mind Light... Clear, bright, unveliebable Light.  You reached it You're fading Air? None Needing Much Fading Again Oxygen? None    Light Fading You Craving Hard Try Harder by the minute Die
