I don't think anyone else will listen to my rambling, or would want to.  So yeah Ben and Melissa came for supper and we ate alot.  I am so afraid of gaining weight but I just keep eating.  Weight is a big struggle, and well yeah I have done good at maintaining my weight loss but I would like to loose more, however I am thinking if I keep this eating pattern up I might start to gain some.  Everyone gets sick of me talking about weight but they don't realize that while maybe a lot of people don't have weight issues and are thin, some people have a real struggle with it.  I would be one of those people that struggle.  Anyways I was talking to Ben and Melissa and they are getting a hot tub.  That's right a hot tub.  Since their new house is being built they are going to buy it soon and put in the basement because once the house is complete they won't be able to get it in.  And well I am allowed to go over there and use it if I want and stuff.  YAY!  Although it is a long way from the S.W. but I mean c'mon it's a hot tub - that is like what I have always wanted.  Of course for those who know my romantic fantasy date, I dream of being in a steamy hot tub with roses all around with the dark moonlight sky above and a slight fog outside.  Ok that is enough of me fantasizing!  My Dad is in town this weekend - finally!  I feels like it's been forever since I last saw him.  At first I didn't mind him fly back and forth a couple weeks here and there to visit, but now it feels like he is not really my Dad.  I mean of course he is, but since I don't see him a lot it feels that way.  My mother says that sometimes it feels like she is single so I guess my feelings are actually quite common.  Anyways my parents said that next February break I might miss like a day of school or something but we are going to fly to Florida.  That is where one of the NASA buildings is located, and I made my dad promise me that we are going to go for a tour.  He never breaks promises, so yay we get to go!  I just have a long ways to wait.  That is basically like a year from now - so yeah it's a long ways away at the moment.  I think that tomorrow I am going to the zoo!  How exciting - I sound like a kid.  Anyways I want to see that new white tiger, at least I think that is what it is.  I love tigers, cats, you name it - anything feline.  Of course I think that I will sleep in on my last day off.  I miss school a lot because it is like a second home to me.  Half of my life is spent there, and it keeps me busy.  Today I also did that contest thing in the sun where you like go through the papers for the week and find answers to questions.  If you get picked you can get a $2000 scholarship to a post-secondary institution.  So yeah I am going to mail it in, and I think it goes for a couple weeks.
