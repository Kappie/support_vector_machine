This summer lies before me like an empty stretch of sand, which I am just dying to plaster with graffiti of life and fun and laughter and love.  American University is my next step (I leave 8/17, for those of you keeping track) but I have a lot to look forward to before all that. I am making $14 an hour tutoring Bar and Bat Mitzvah students at Tifereth Israel, a miracle and a blessing despite its short duration due to my leaving in August.  Also, I'll be doing a few weeks of babysitting in the mornings for an adorable little girl for around $500.  And remember crazy Mr. Hernandez, my conservative government teacher?  I am grading papers for his summer school classes for a small fee, as well. Sam-Jon and I are over as a couple but stronger in a "Will and Grace" sort of friendship, as far as I'm concerned, without the whole gay part.  My next relationship will be with someone a little closer to my past and present, probably Jewish, maybe more dedicated to school and music.  A few people, loved ones actually, from my past have begun to haunt my memories.  I feel as though I am missing something, like I should be aware that there is someone who loves me and I someone have managed to ignore this fellow.  What could that be or mean?  I don't know.  These days, I have a bit to much time on my hands to think. I should be meeting my roommate on the phone in a few days.  All I know so far is a name, a phone number, and that she is from Austin, TX.  Whatever that means politically or culturally, next year should be quite an adventure. Whoever you are reading this lovely personal publication, please call me.  Maybe you know who the mystery lover-boy/stalker? is- haha- or maybe you are him.  We'll see.
