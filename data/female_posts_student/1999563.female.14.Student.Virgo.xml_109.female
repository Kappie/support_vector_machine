Marc and I are coming out with an ablum...its gonna be called Crimson Tide...lol...we rapped today..it was intersting!    Hmmm........Nothing at all interesting happend today. OOH! I LOST THHHHE LIST! It was bad. I had to make a NEW ONE!  Are you on the list? I don't know...who are YOU?   Lalal...sorry. My blog is BORING today.  Randomness.... Cheese! My sisters birthday party is today. SAVE ME My sisters friend is a model. Hahhaha She isn't THAT gorgeous. I should be a model I just have to drop one size, then I will be perfect :P I can't wait till I fit in size uno jeans. It will be great. I am so insecure.  Whats the point of loosing weight? Its not like that will make people like me.   ~*God Speaks*~ I will probably be posting this every once in a while. But somedays god just REALLY speaks to me. Today was one of those days he was telling me "Pretty soon your going to be all alone, friends will leave you. But stay with me, you will never be alone." It was pretty spiftacular. But, a little scary. I hate being alone.   I better leave......BYE!  Love, Laura   P.S.- Fun conversation of the day: Mandy: good girl,  thats why i love you  SHE LOVES MEEEEEE
