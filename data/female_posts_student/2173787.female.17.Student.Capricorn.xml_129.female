I would give up what I have now if I knew...and I would really have to know...that I would gain a passion for something, a useful place working towards an actual goal, not the intangible ones I have now.  If someone could somehow guarantee that I would feel accomplished and closer to something tangible each night when I laid down to sleep, that I would have something worthy of cultivation and sacrifice, I would leap.  All too often do I feel like I'm treading water, never moving further, just continously straining to remain afloat in my fixed location."  Thats what has got me down as of late.  There are no longer signs of progress no end in sight.  As I accomplish one assignment another leaps out at me.  Right now most of my time is sucked up by school and homework so that I can get into a good college, so that I can get a good job.  But I don't know what I want to do, that I will be any more fulfilled or content tommorrow, or next year, or in five years, or ever.  I have spent the past 4 hours on homework and there is still mounds more and there will be tommorrow too.  There are so many things that I want to do that I want to see that I want to think about and yet there is never anytime.  I collapse into bed every night between 11 and midnight and have a few fleeting hours of fitful sleep.  I wake up repeatedly tangled and uncomfortable and yet somehow I can't escape it.  Suddenly all the purpose I had has dissipated, I feel disconected and hurried, not taking the time or care that things need.  Things like friendships, committments, myself.  Some element needs to change, but unfortunately I don't know what that element is.
