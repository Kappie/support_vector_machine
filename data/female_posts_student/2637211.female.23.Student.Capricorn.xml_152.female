I just want to be done with finals and I want to go to Disneyland and start a new knitting project. I need to knit a scarf for Fi, and after that I want to make a pink and black striped scarf for Holly. At some point I want to make a pink scarf for Liz too, so I'm getting mighty back logged. I also want to make myself a poncho. Here's a  urlLink link  to the pattern. I think I want to make mine in either hot pink or maybe something more off-white and pale blue, to be more summery.
