Dave i like but i'm not sure... We'll see. Why say no you don't want to marry me? Why think you ever wanted to get engaged in the first place? STUPID STUPID person. Laying on my stomach? Sticking his tongue out, talking about sex, having control over me, i need to resist him, and stop thinking about it all, wanting him but hating him, and wanting to not hear about it, Laura, and Emily, and i just ignore it and tell him they are silly and they should like him, but hes not really anymore successful than me in getting people? He has these flings but no one seems to want to get serious, and i don't want marriage, i don't want love, i just want him, we worked, and he knows it, its why he reminds me of everything, and its why he still cares etc, bastard, wanker, cunt!   ~Lisa~
