It was an alright flick about a writer who is going through a divorce, which ultimately gives him a severe case of writers block and in a predictable Fight Club-type twist you realize that the guy is crazy and he ends up killing everybody. If you haven't seen it, but were desperately anticipating your opportunity to see it, I apologize if my brief description somehow ruined the suspense of the movie for you. But honestly, you're not missing anything. Really. You're not.   The only good thing about this movie was Johnny Depp. *flutters eyelashes*  he's dreamy.  I remember him back to his Cry Baby days. Now  that  movie is pure cheese. Good stuff.  And you know, it's not everyday that a girl can reflect on her Teen Beat magazines and fantasize about  the same  actor. His posters graced my walls with the company of Cory Haim and Cory Feldman. And  where  are those guys today? Hmmm? Certainly not where Depp is.  That's  for sure!   Speaking of Johnny Depp, do I dare bring up the subject of - Willy Wonka? The  remake . As much as I love Johnny Depp, and I don't doubt that he will do a great job, I think this is horrible idea. Is American cinema so lacking in original thought that every classic has to be remade? Give me a break. I know there are thousands of screenwriters out there with brilliant and innovate screenplays trying desperately to infiltrate Hollywood. But oh no. Oh no no no no no. Instead, films like Predator Vs Alien, I-Robot, and every single video game imaginable gets turned into a movie. The same thing is being done over and over and over again. NOTHING original anymore. It's quite sad.  If they remake Goonies, I'll cut out my eyeballs and sew the lids shut in a massive protest.
