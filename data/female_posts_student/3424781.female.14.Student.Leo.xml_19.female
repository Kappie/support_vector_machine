I'm goin up there on the 15th of July  comin back on the 5th of aug, 4 days after my b-day  4 days b4 school starts. My bro ardis is comin 2. it's not like he has nething planned. Also my Nanny wants to throw me a b-day party while I'm up there. I just hope she doesn't go all crazy  get all pink stuff  a Barbie cake. I would like a chocolate carvel ice cream cake. Those r good with the little chocolate crunchies  we don't have ne carvels near me though they do sell the cakes in the grocery store.
