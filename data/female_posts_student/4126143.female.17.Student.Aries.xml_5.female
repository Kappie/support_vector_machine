Today I am just mixed with so many emotions! I feel refreshed from a wonderful weekend! Anxious to help other ppl and to start a new beginning, Sad and hurt cuz brians leaving soon, Happy that  i met so many awesome ppl this weekend:), Grateful that i found God's love, Excited that Emilys going to a TEC:),and so much more!! I have feelings that i don't even know how to describe! Life means so much more to me now! Sooo many people influenced my life lately that I don't even know how to thank them...They are truly  angels of God . Yet, with all of this hope and ambitions for the future, and wanting to make a difference...I'm still hurting in the inside..I know i have to let go of someone special soon..and its not easy..he has done so much for me, and i have to watch him walk away..the worst part is i know he doesn't feel 4 me the way i feel 4 him,i haven't touched him the way he's touched my life, and he doesnt need me like i need him. But i guess thats the way life goes...
