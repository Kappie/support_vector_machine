We picked up Megan somewhere I dont remember and got down to the church about 2:30. We got there and nobody was there so we stood outside doing cartwheels and random stuff for about 20 mins until Katie showed up with Walter, Ashlee, and Jacob. Walter and Jacob got lost. LoL. Then we couldnt get the church unlocked...lol...So we stood around some more. Walter played with the bell and his head was a little to close to it when it rang so he screamed and ran. LoL Then finally we were givin up on the door so Walter broke in and we all rejoiced. So we just sat around...doing nothing. Ross and Kait came and then that was about it for our crowd. It was alright tho. Its alot of fun when theres only a handful of people there. So we talked about how the rally went and how we are gonna do stuff for NYE. Then we went out to eat in Creston and then went bowling. I did really bad lol. Oh well...I havent bowled in over a year...so yeah. Then we went back to the church and just hung out and watched movies until late...and fell asleep really late like normal. Then before we knew it, it was morning and we had to shower at peoples houses and then go to church. Church actually was pretty interesting...I actually listened! lol So yeah then it was time to leave and it was sad...and I cried....and then slept almost the whole way home...so yeah thats bout all that happened...it was good...*nod*....but I had no idea when Im gonna see Ross again...*sigh* Oh well pretty soon he can drive and then we can see each other more...hopefully...*sigh*  -Tara
