It's killing me.. forget about it."  -- Why worry, by The All American Rejects  The lyrics of my favourite song so applies to me, an emphasis on the 'so'. I'm always in sweat about everything and I've really gotta stop worrying. GEEEE. Zuhayr and Mr Lee can really read my mind man. Sorry Jake.. for venting my anger on you today. I didn't mean to punch you so many times. Feel like killing myself! Mwahahahaha.  Tmrw's the CC comp. I'm exhilarated! Girls just wanna have fun. ;) Hehehe.   Congrats to last year's batch of O level peeps! You guys did  damn  well! Peace out. XOX.
