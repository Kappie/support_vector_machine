It all refuses to come together, images, emotions swirling faster and faster within my mind, yet gone as soon as they come.  Its a dream world, when I surface i no longer can remember what pulled me under.  Instead I lose chunks of time, chunks of consciousness to nothing, to something. I sat down at my computer not knowing what to type but compelled to do something and my fingers are now flying.  Someone has IMed me but I am ignoring so as not to stop the flow of thoughts.  The snow has buried everything, the filth, the destruction, but also the beauty of bulbs just peaking out of the ground.  If I was to go to the cemetery, I would not know where Zayde is, buried under this thick blanket.  People have been so kind, so cautious, so welcoming.  Others have no idea that anything has happened.  Both drive me crazy.  Don't know why...  Don't know much, except that I still haven't caught up on calculus so its good i don't have school tomorrow.  Going stir crazy, sick of my house, sick of Bubby's apartment.  Lets go on a trip to somewhere, anywhere.
