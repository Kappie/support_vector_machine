I need his site to survive, to live on....*exageratting* Now I have to go and download 'skins' from 'BlogSkin', oh god. I do not want to be a copy cat. But I think I have to, haiz.... Work tomorrow and in the morning. I just cannot drag myself out of the bed at 5.30 am in the wee hours of the morning! It's just not me! And I don't wake up at this hour to go to school too... What to do.... I need the money to purchase my SD or AI. Having second thoughts to buy a smaller doll. Like the Petite Angel- Gabriel from Custom house...
