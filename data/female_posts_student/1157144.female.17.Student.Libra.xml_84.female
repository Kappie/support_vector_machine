Dancer in the dark? maggie going blind and getting hung? ah! ok, i still think about that movie too much....  ah! you too laura? i had a SUPER weird dream last night  i was in wyoming and maggie was there, and all of a sudden she's like "aw shit, i gotta go home and take care of jenny because she's sick. but i have somhting else that's really important to do" and she wouldn't tell me what the other thing was, so i kinda gave up and told he that i would go to her house and watch jenny while she was out. so i did. and it got really late. it's was like 3 am or somthing, and i was just sitting in her room on her computer while jenny was sleeping. eventually i got thirsty so i went into the kitchen for H2O..and maggie's parents were there. and it was really creepy, cause they were sitting at the table, and maggie's mom was doing a crossword and her dad was reading a paper, but they were in the pitch dark... and how, they basically were really freaked out at first, cause they had looked in the room and seen the back of my head and just assumed it was maggie, then maggie's mom walked me home...veeeerrrry odd.  that's right jason. run. run far....but you'll never be safe...muahahaha
