Char: I won't steal your sole! I mean soul!  Anna: Are you sure?  Char: Certain never is. Anna:If you get in the mood, take Brooke's sole...soul.  Brooke:It's times like these you find out who you're real friends are...  Char: *hysterical laughter*  *giggles*  This is why we need to purchase group striaght jackets everyone.  Oh my, the Runescape is calling to me. But I really need to get a shower.
