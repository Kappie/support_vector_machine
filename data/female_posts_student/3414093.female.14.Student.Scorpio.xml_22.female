So here is the jiffy pop version with some updates included:  I wish I could turn off my emotions Jeffrey better be able to come up on friday I'm taking Jeffrey to a dance and to a party at (Marlee's) James' house I got Jeffrey's letter and it was awesome I spent like four hours making stuff for people and writing letters to people yesterday I hate my (ex)dad... I hate my (ex)stepmom... This kid David (from GJ) is pretty saucy 'I like to play'-Garth from Wayne's World...I'm sorry...I had to add that I'm trying not to love James...and I'm doing a pretty damn good job of not thinking about him...mainly because I haven't been talking to him a lot because I think he is avoiding me... Dave is a neat kid Jon (awesome guy) broke up with his girlfriend...and I think he was hinting for me to jump him at the party on saturday...which is weird because he is usually all 'nooooooo...no underage girls' of course he says it in a much more suave way I think I'm done here...  XOXO
