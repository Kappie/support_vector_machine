Not much has changed, actually--interpret that as you wish. I think the highlight of my day wasn't eating that gross orange-flavored PB or not being able to use the copy machine like I said I could with JP (Jorge Pedro! hah!) but MOCK TRIAL. We are one crazy group, and if it's anything to make me feel better, it's good ol' MT. Arr, I still wish I could drive. Think: it's two miles to the gate, a nominal two more to get post-it's at Staples or two the other way to BJ's for BJ's night tomorrow. No biggie, honestly. But then I think, whoa, what if I get killed or something and I get in deep trouble for it? I don't know, deep down I'm still so conservative it's not even funny. But I really want to go somewhere now that I think I'm partway capable of doing so.  The concerto's falling together in my head--yay!  No hw, really, for second semester. What am I going to do with my time now? Sort out stuff? Yeah, maybe.
