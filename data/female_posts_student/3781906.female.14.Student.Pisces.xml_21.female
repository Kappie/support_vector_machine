I'm proud of my country, my president, and all those if Iraq right now. I thank you for devoting your lives to the people of this world.   Now, for real business! Annie and Daryn (AKA, Erin and Danny)'s wedding was fantastic! The reception was a load of fun! I don't thin k I've enjoyed myself that much in a long time. (Not including the boast cruise in Ottawa, guys...). Again, congratulations guys! We love you!
