This episode was only worthwhile for the presence, albeit brief, of Jason Isaacs, even though I could only understand about half of what he said.  Don't ask me what else happened, because I honestly didn't follow the episode too well, having missed last weeks lead in.    "Law  Order" fared better, though instead of being ripped from the headlines, it was ripped direct from Patricia Highsmith and Alfred Hitchcock.  Yes, that's right, it was a variation on the theme of  Strangers on a Train , with women instead of men and minus the homosocial overtones and homosexual undertones.  It was also done well enough that it didn't become obvious quickly, and with a fleeting reference to Hitchcock from D.A. Arthur Branch.  But the highlight was the sendoff for Jerry Orbach.  It was done with just the right amount of nostalgia and not a moment more of lingering than necessary.  His presence on the show will surely be missed.
