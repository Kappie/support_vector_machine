For some off reason I feel this sort of betrayal by everyone. I guess I'm just not really a people person. I guess I don't know who I am anymore. And I'm so sick of everyone. My family, my "friends", you know, I honestly don't know what I'm doing anymore. Or even what I'm fucking saying right now.  The only thing I can think of is how much I absolutely hate life. How I hate every aspect of it. And maybe that's sinning in some way, and maybe it's my fault, but I don't know what to change.  I hate being like this. I hate how I am. I'm just done. I've got to stop relying on people, because I  hate  people. And by people I am encompassing just about everyone, give or take maybe one or two people, who I can't really even think of at the moment.  Honestly, I'm so frustrated. I've just got to get out of this.
