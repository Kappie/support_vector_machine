Im really bored! like really really bored! so a bit about me... ummmmmm I will start with the good stuff... I luv each and every one of my friends, i enjoy soccer!, I love hanging out with my friends, movies, boys, msn, email, music, and so much more. I am kinda down to earth. I can like practically anyone and everyone! I've got a great bunch of friends... and I have the coolest step sister in the world... now for the bad stuff My family hates me... I hate them. I have depression. I cut my wrists and have suicidal thoughts. I used to be seriously and completely a suicidal person... I tried it so may times but a few friends helped me out and friends are the only good thing in my life! oh and my dad has a new girlfriend... her name is Mary I HATE HER!!! but she has a cool daughter... Bianca... and two cool sons... David and Leon... they are all like years older then me but who gives. oh and my mum lives in Queensland and I live in South Australia and my real brother (Jason) lives with her. So I only see them 4 times a year. If you have any questions about me... um just ask... Luv Ya All, Madz
