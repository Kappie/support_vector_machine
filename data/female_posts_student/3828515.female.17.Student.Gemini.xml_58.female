This is the second night in a row that I have almost forgotten to write something in this blog, so you know I must be sleepy. In fact, please forgive me if anything here sounds completely incoherent. Today was a band camp day. Something was wrong with the show. Blah, blah, blah... Something about tennis... Some food I ate... Um... That's all. I've already forgotten what I have written thus far. Lots of craziness and laughing - and drama - at the rehearsal tonight. Despite the drama, that was so much fun. By the way, we've got some inconsiderate, immature, and illogical people in the Batavia High School band program... Just in case you did not already know this. Good night.      Last song I listened to:   Until It Sleeps  by Metallica.   Last album I listened to:   The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner .   Last meal I ate:  Macaroni  cheese.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Oh, you know. The usual yelling and screaming and insanity at band camp.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Dan.   Favorite song today:   Don't Change Your Plans  by Ben Folds Five.   Favorite food today:  I do not know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Once again. Stupid band camp. I'm such a nerd.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Oh, many, many things. If only I were more energetic right now.
