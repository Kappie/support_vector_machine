Am not going to write much now even though I promised (I’m sorry) because it is midnight and I’ve just got in and I HAVE to have a reasonably early night (ok so this isn’t early, but compared to my 2ams recently it is early).  But I’ve just has a WONDERFUL evening with Debs (and I’m not just saying that Deborah) It was so cool just to hang out with someone, to just be normal – well as normal as you can get with me and Debs in one place.  We cooked risotto (well I stirred the risotto) and then we ate – funnily enough – then we had vienetta (yum yum) and then stripped wallpaper – which was SO good.  Strange as it seems I actually love that sort of thing – it is so rewarding and such a sense of achievement like when it’s all done.  We didn’t totally complete it but I finished my wall so I was chuffed.  Then the crème de la crème…..we watched ER!!!!!!  I was introduced to the rules of ER watching, and practically had to shove my hand in my mouth to stop myself from breaking them.  It was a great episode because it was set in the NICU (Neonatal intensive care unit for you non-medics) which I love and it had lots of babies in it (duh, obviously). But it was totally unrealistic because the babies were too big, you wouldn’t treat the parents like they did, they really don’t use quite that much jargon, medical students wouldn’t even be in NICU….Sorry Debs you didn’t say I couldn’t complain about the medical side on my blog – you just said not during the programme!    Also had a cool day because I went to help look after the kiddies at the Talk Together group and we had less kids today, but had the 4 gorgeous babies, who all needed lots of cuddles obviously.  This week was the last one until after Easter, and they had brought this gorgeous bunch of flowers for me and the other lady who helps.  They were so lovely.  Made me feel really valued and appreciated.  Oh funny incident today. Went shopping to Aldi (just like this cheap German supermarket we have over here) and they had 3 in 1 lycra cycling outfits!!!  Was so tempted to get one for Spandex boy!!!  Would you like me to bring one out?! He he.  Ok goodnight folk, have a good rest of your Wednesday.  Two weeks tomorrow......
