Thus, I have found lyrics(slightly modified) that fit how I feel about how everyone in my school treats each other.   I am the son And the heir Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar I am the son and heir Of nothing in particular  You shut your mouth How can you say I go about things the wrong way ? I am Human and I need to be loved Just like everybody else does  I am the son And the heir Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar I am the son and heir Oh, of nothing in particular  You shut your mouth How can you say I go about things the wrong way ? I am human and I need to be loved Just like everybody else does  There's a place, if you'd like to go You could meet somebody who really loves you So you go, and you stand on your own And you leave on your own And you go home, and you cry And you want to die  When you say it's gonna happen "now" Well, when exactly do you mean? See I've already waited too long And all my hope is gone  You shut your mouth How can you say I go about things the wrong way? I am human and I need to be loved Just like everybody else does   Also, sidenote: I am also out of this wretched school in 13.5 days.  No more listening to idiot Christians talk about Ludacris and Eminem.  "My Band" and "Milkshake" ARE NOT APPROPRIATE!!!!!!   Oy vay.  AND THE BACKSTABBING!  Oh my word.  Two faced has a new definition.  Its not like public school is any better but hey I expect it from the unsaved.  I also think they will notice a difference between me and them.  Also, there should be a lot more people in my class.  These past three years have been really different from what I am used to.  I can't take my peers shallow stupidity much longer.  14 days of peace.  That is all I want.  And my food.  *leaves*
