YIPPE! then my sister was like "Oh no! I left my purse at church!" So we had to turn around and drive alll the way back!  Finally, we arrived at Target.  First I went to the clothes and got a bunch of clothes to try on. They were all cool pant suits and stuff.  So I was in the dressing room and I trid on a really really cute button up shirt and black blazer.  It looked realy good on me but while I was standing there looking at myself in the mirror I started thinking.  I look totally fake.  I don't really wear make-up but there in my suit top I realized I was just trying to fit in...I was trying to be like Lauren.  Not that Lauren is bad or anything.  But all my life I have always wanted to be included.  When I was younger I never had many friends so when I went to school I seriously told myself that I was going to be the msot popular girl in school no matter what.  But it never came to be.  I tried and tried, but never even a moment of popularity came.  But now, I quit   I am never going to be popular so I might as well quit trying!! :)   Anyways, I went to the underwear asile and foudn the cutest underweare on the face of this earth.  They are hello kitty!  Well, I had to buy them because nothing makes my day like quite underwear. And legally I can by them because no one can see them so I am not tryin got fit in with my udnerwear type.   What a great day.
