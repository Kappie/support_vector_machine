It was horrible, I faked being happy the whole time, the only good thing was that I finally Heard The Beautiful by Five For Fighting, Dad had the We Were Soldiers soundtrack, so that was cool. Well, dad got me a real rose dipped in 24K Gold, which is pretty, but its a boyfriend to girlfriend gift, not father to daughter gift, I'm sorry. The other thing he got me was a CHEAP cross necklace, the cross was sooo what the word...Um...Thin. But the chain, THAT was pretty. But its all gold.. grrr! I really dislike Gold. I am a silver person, sorry. BUT he did send me a bouque of flowers. They were pretty, so did Bill and Jennifer. I called to Thank them, and to wish Jennifer a Happy Birthday too, but she is in Milwalkee :'( So I called her cell and left her a message. Ok, so I get home from dad's house at 4, and Mom still isn't home! So I get on the computer and talk to Selena and Tracy, who are SOO sweet!! Selena is like the most awesomest person ever. I love her to death! I wish she was my sister :(. But mom gets home.. She went grocery shopping..... Yeah, I know!! lol. But she doesn't want to wait for Bryan to get home, so she gives me my presents, I GOT A PALM PILOT!! It is sooo awesome. But I already over worked it, and Its kinda frozen at the moment, lol. Bryan says that I have to let the battery run out. Which sucks! Mom also got me The Butterfly Effect on DVD.. SOO cool!!! Bryan got me $25 for Hot Topic, and $25 for Streetside Records. I want to get a LOT of CD's: Lisa Loeb's Hello Lisa, Ben Folds Five's Rockin' the Suburbs, Josh Groban's Closer, Trapt's Trapt...grrr... lol. Dude.. I got NO money this year....... WITH?! lol. I'll live. Oh yeah, I wrote John Ondrasik. I told him: "I'm not 15 for a moment, and I'm not caught in between 10 and 20" it was funny. I hope he laughs. Um.. What else.. You know that I talked to Matt last night, that was awesome.. But.. No Tony :'(. I think he's gonna be mad more then me, though. He is a sweetheart, and I'm glad that I know him. I have been very fortunate lately. And I don't know why. I'm scared that something bad is going to happen. You know what I mean? Usually when something good happens, something bad happens to equal is out. So, that's why I'm scared. I believe that too.            yah! I got my Palm pilot to work!! YAY!! **wipes forehead** I was worried about that!            You know, I had a great birthday, but all of my friends online thought I was soo weird that I didn't have a part, or anything. And, now, thinking about it, I agree. I do regret not having a party or anything. But, when my friend "Dryve Bi" asked me who my boyfriend was, and was he taking me out to dinner, my heart sank. I should have a boyfriend right now, and I do miss not having one.            ~~Breena            Where am I headed      In this crazy world?      Destination Unknown      Something new      Around ever corner      Isn't growing up great?      What a wonderful life      But only if we make it so            So many choices      So much anxiety      So much pain      But, so much happiness      So much joy            The world is an equal place      But it depends who you are      This world can be a beautiful place      Or it can be your hell      What you do right now      Will forever effect your future      So, keep that in mind      As you grow up, and live            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~            Is this what you thought,      When you imagined Heaven?      Or did you think of clouds,      and forever light?      My Heaven is this,      Being in your arms tonight.
