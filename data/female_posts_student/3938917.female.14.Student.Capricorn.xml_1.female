Anyways, we got there and Andy and Tyler were there too so I watched Bub play his Gamecube for a while and then played with his snake which was really cool cause I like snakes :) But anyways, didn't really have time to play...and he's leaving for Canada for Friday which is sad...oh well, he'll have fun for sure. But anyways, that's about all that went on today on this busy Monday in July...whooo...and I'm watching Newsies and listening music and talking to people AND playing Sims on my other computer; I'm a multitasker. Well, I'm going now, maybe something interesting will happen soon that can take up more space to write about.
