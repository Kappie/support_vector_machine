Sarah and Ishita and co. just stepped out of the room ready to go clubbing or whatever. I prefer a slower, quieter kind of life, I guess. Straight out of a J. Crew catalog, or so I'd like to think. I have an itch to go shopping, but I think I'll wait for Wendy.  Waiting for Jenn to finish her dinner so we can go to Au Bon Pain to get more Proust reading done.  There's a really cheap Mexican place below the Garage...Felipe's. Not as good as anything back home, but an acceptable substitute.  So now that they're gone, I can just turn up Jimmy Eat World.  I'm on p. 229 of Proust. Out of a possible 606.  Going to lunch with Victoria tomorrow.  Today's just disappeared fast. I don't have much Burma reading left, and then there's always Proust.   Brittara's in town. I don't know if they got back, but we left her and Charlie in the Garage and we just walked back to the dorms, etc.  It's been a nice day. Yup yup.
