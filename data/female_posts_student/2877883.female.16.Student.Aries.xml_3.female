It just usually seems that like when I get home the afternoon from like 3-5 flies by and I don't even realize it, and then it's dark out and it feels like I have no time before I go to bed.  And I'm sure that part will be true, but for now I am enjoying our long afternoon.  Even though I have an absolutely gigantic history test tomorrow and I really want to finish my book for English, but I have to write my discussion response reflections stuff first or else I'll get too confused I think.   Lovely.  A lot and really nothing at the same time happened today, so it was kind of one of those weird days.  OK that sounded so dumb but I really don't care.    I think I'm still waiting for my life to start.
