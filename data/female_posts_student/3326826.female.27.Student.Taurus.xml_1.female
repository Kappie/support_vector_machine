It was initially created as a comics by Hiromu Arakawa, and it became so famous that ENIX decided to make it as a TV animation series last winter.  ENIX hired BONES, a famous group of creaters that produced "Cowboy Bebop : The Movie" and "Wolf's Rain", for this project.  In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, "alchemy" is a science that manipulate materials to another by sacrificing something. There were two young genius brothers who tried to revive their mother without knowing that resurrecting LIFE was prohibited, and they lost a part or whole of their bodies while doing the ritual of resurrection.  The younger brother lost his whole body and the older brother lost his left leg during the process. However, the older brother could bind his younger brother's soul to an armor by sacrificing his right arm.  Therefore, this animation is a story about these two young alchemist brothers who are on a way to find the alchemist's stone so that they can recover their own body parts.   I actually only read comics, but I was fascinated by the comics. I'll definitely watch this animation when it will be on air.  There are two cool trailers in the homepage.  Don't forget to watch them!
