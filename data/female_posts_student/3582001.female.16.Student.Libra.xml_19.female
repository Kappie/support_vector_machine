Okay, I don't know who posted the comment on my last entry, but I'm not going to yell at you for caring about Nick, although I'm sure you don't know the whole story. Yes, I read that story in his LJ also. Listen, I care for Nick very very much. He is my best friend. Anyone who knows him or knows me, knows THAT. The thing is, he has had the tendancy to like me as more than a friend, and this is the reason he gets so downhearted. Because I do not care for him in this way. Please don't tell me that this is my fault. You can't force someone to love someone else. I do love him...as a FRIEND. So stop with the "Thanks for hurting someone who loves you so much" crap. I don't do it on purpose. And now that you have to "take care of him more than usual"...(You make it sound like a chore. Don't you love him, too?)...I'm sure we won't have to worry about him being so depressed anymore, because he has you 4, whoever you are.  *CTS*  I HAVE HAD SO MUCH FUN LATELY. MY LIFE ROCKS! Last week, my cousin Clarissa came over and spent 2 nights. We swam and jumped on the trampoline, and listened to music, and painted our toe-nails (haha), and many other things. Plus! Wednesday, we went to a movie, Spiderman 2, with Hooch and Jents. It was great fun. But Clarissa keeps telling me how she regrets not making-out with Hoochie. Haha. I love you dear. Jents is really RAD! And he smells so good! Axe Body-Spray is the best! OH BOY, yeah! MJ! Haha, her name is Mary Jane! Hehehe, don't ask. Where's YOUR fancy stuff? Woo! Good stuff! Well, I gots-ta go. See ya!
