And I kinda forgot about this little BLOG called The Daily Mollio Show.  Did I ever tell you where that name comes from?  No?  Okay, well I don't remember, so it doesn't really matter.  We got report cards yesterday.  I have an A+ in Global Issues, A's in Geometry, Spanish, P.E., and Biology, an A- in Keyboarding, and a B+ in Honors English.  My GPA is 3.8.  Shit, I was soooo pissed.  My English grade was very close to an A-.  Well, that's all for now.  I'm going to Chicago on Sunday for Spanish Club.  Adios!!!  MOLLIO I
