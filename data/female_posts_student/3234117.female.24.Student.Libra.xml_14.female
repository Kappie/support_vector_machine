I'm walking to my apartment and I think to myself, hmmm they put up some signs while I was at work.  I get to my door, and I try to unlock it.  I don't realize I'm on the wrong floor til the people that live there open the door wondering whose trying to get in.  You can imagine how shocked I was to think these people were in my apartment! It was so embarrassing! Next time I'll be more observant and notice the big 5 on the wall.
