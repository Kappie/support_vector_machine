     
      Yawningin the early dawn, Looking out and then I fawn.  Trying so hard tohave friends, In the end I cannot mend.  Where's the voice that's supposed to be mine? When's the day that I will turn fine?  So many troubles in my mind, Can I softly speak my lines?  Then the daylight starts to break, As I see the people wake.  Can I ask you for a dime, Will you give me one more chance?
