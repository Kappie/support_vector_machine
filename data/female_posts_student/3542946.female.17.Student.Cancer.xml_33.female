Today I, like some other m3r members participated in the GAT, a general achievement test given out by the Victorian curriculum and assessment authority (VCAA) to all students doing a year 12 subject. And lo! To my surprise it was full of discrimination.  Not only discrimination but a booklet full of contradictory confabulations of relativism and absolutism, the non maths questions are almost all perspective dependent but then they demand a single answer in the form of multiple choice questions. This idiocy is infuriating, how can there be one given answer to an opinionative question? Whatever happened to social relativism; what may be true and obvious for say someone from an Australian background may not be so true for someone from Asia or America. The questions in the afore mentioned GAT required not only a high level on English but a particular cultural outlook, something which not all the students in our diverse school have.  Some questions ask for an analysis of cartoons and texts, how can everybody agree on what they mean when even people in the same family disagree about there meanings? since by there very nature they are meant to have an infinite amount of interpretations, each person looking at it in their own valued and equally true way. And since we all have to do the GAT next year, I feel that something should be done to correct this insidious corruption and mindless stupidity in out education system.  What do fellow m3r members say?
