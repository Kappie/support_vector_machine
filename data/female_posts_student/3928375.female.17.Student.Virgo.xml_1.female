Then we went to my friends irinas and elenas house where renee was given organic cherry tomatoes right from their garden. She was complimented on her beauty- which, of course, a big sister always loves to hear. We were also generously give cucumbers longer than the length of my shin- or maybe the length of my thigh--- Pretty Damn Big. (Dont get any gross thoughts). The cucumbers are for eating purposes ONLY lol. Then we went to Toys R Us- Fun Fun. We came home exhausted! Then when mom and her went to nap, I slid away to Owings Mills Mall and did some major shopping.  Last night was a blast. I came home a bit after one. SO nervous about getting pulled over by a cop since I still have my provisionals- what can I say, Im a goody goody. Most people would say FUCK IT. But yeah, so, I was at Irina and Elena's house last night. First we played poker- I LOVE IT!!! I guess its a very addictive game, but thank god we only play with poker chips instead of money because Im sure I would go bonkers and quickly move to Vegas. I, for some reason, kept calling it a "Ladie's Night" even though there was this one boy named Adam there. Another girl, also named Irina, came over a bit later. It was such a blast! But it kind of was a girls night since I had my hair straightened, back massaged (wink wink), and my nails done. My friend Jeremy called me randomnly from Atlantic City- he always calls me randomnly- Just to say HEY. I think we covered basically every sexual topic imaginable. I want to end this by saying that I cant wait to go to the 311 concert with Irina on July 30th- that girl rocks my world. I honestly dont think I've kissed any other girl on the lips as much as we kiss each other lol.
