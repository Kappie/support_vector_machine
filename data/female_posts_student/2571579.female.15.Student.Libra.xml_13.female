Then I played Al in spit and lost..and then in checkers.. and i lost again. But whatever it was fun lol. After work I had an orthodontist apt. which was not cool. He said that i have a problem with the way I swallow? how dare he! Well anyway neither of my retainers fit and i'm not getting new ones which is gay.. my teeth are probally going to move and I'm gonna be pissed and if he thinks he's getting me to put braces on again he's joking himself.   After that I went for a run .. a long one. It was exactly 50 minutes. I dont know how far really but on my schedual I'm gonna write 5 cause I'm suposta do that one day this week. Then I did some things that I was suposta be doing all summer, like step-ups and the heel-raise series. So I'm probally gonna be sore tomorrow.   I beleive tonight I'm going to Hoop City for the Hannan Varsity games, both girls and boys. The only person that i think will be playing is Eileen and i'm not even sure but I'll finish when I get back.
