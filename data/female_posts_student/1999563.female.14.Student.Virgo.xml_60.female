I never knew the had a bathtub permanatly under the stage. That was weird. Last night my sister made me TURN OFF the light when I was reading, I yelled. I tried to think of the best insult I could say without getting in trouble. I came up with "you need to grow up" Pretty pathetic, eh?? :o) The only reason I was mad that she wanted the light OFF was because she LOVVESS to sleep with the light ON. What a loser head. See....the only reason she wanted me to turn off the light is because she knew it would make me angry then she could get me in trouble....Does that make any sense at all? I think it does! Mwa hahaha...I should be a phycologist. But, first, I need to learn how to spell that. Right now it is 6:14. I just got out of the shower. I hate showers!!! :P  Random Thoughts... I am sooo tired. I wonder what I will do today I forgot to practice my piano AHHH My teacher is going ot be angry I hope she doesn't yell I currently weigh 10 pounds for than Karsen, if that will means anything in my lifetime.  I am off to blow dry my hair! Ugh...blow drying is one of the unessasary evils of this day in age.  I am out like a  light  Laura
