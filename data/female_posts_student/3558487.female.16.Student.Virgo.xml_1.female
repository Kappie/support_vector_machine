I don't really care if i get my hair wet while swimming, its just that i have a lot of hair so it gets really heavy and annoying when i do, but swimming is more fun when you go underwater and have 'how long can you hold your breath' contests. I won! All that flute playing helps. :)   I'm leaving on wednesday for upstate NY! How exciting. The only thing, is that i hope that our family doesn't get sick of eachother. Sometimes when we are in small places for a week, we do get a little snappy. It should be fun though, its very pretty up there, there's mountains and everything!   I've decided that i will start on my senior overalls soon before my summer gets all busy and crazy. It should be fun and erin said she would give me her paint and stuff cuz she doesn't need it anymore. Senior years are expensive with the SR pictures and stuff.. its craazy.   I guess that's it!   Have a good night everyone!  -Lisa  Song: "In Other Words" - Ben Kweller
