Looking back, I can see so many ways that this has affected our relationship. I really want to be able to discuss this with him. How can I start him talking?  -----  First, a note of caution: if you are in a casual relationship, you might want to think twice about participating in your boyfriend's healing process. Healing from sexual abuse is a long, hard road. If you don't want to put in a lot of time and energy supporting your boyfriend, you need to consider your own boundaries and you need to stick to them from the beginning. That said, a well-placed ear, caring support, and BELIEF in their experience can all be great gifts for abuse survivors.  If your boyfriend's clamming up, it might be because he doesn't want to talk about his abuse with a) anyone or b) you. So don't bulldoze him into revealing all if he's not ready. Instead, I suggest bringing the topic up in a way that leaves him a choice on whether or not to share with you. Something maybe like, "Boyfriend, a while back you told me a bit about being abused as a child. I just want you to know that if you want to talk about it now or any time, I would love to be there for you. I don't want to pressure you, but I do want to be able to support you as much as I can. What do you think?"  Here are some more ideas about talking your partner:  1) You should pick a quiet time (NOT during, right before, or right after sex) when you both are relatively relaxed and have some hours to devote to the discussion.  2) If your partner wants to talk about his past but is having difficulty, try taking baby communication steps instead of aiming for a full revelation right from the start. Talk about WHY he can't talk about the abuse, for example.  3) AVOID saying anything that could be remotely construed as blaming the victim or denying the assault. This includes the following statements: "But why didn't you tell anyone?""I don't understand how no one could know if it really happened." "Your mom would NEVER do something like that--she's so sweet!" "But why did you go home with him if you didn't know him?" "I just don't understand how MEN could be RAPED." Trust me. Large parts of society (and possibly a good part of your boyfriend) are already blaming him for the abuse, so...  4) Keep your doubts to yourself. It will be a nice, and NECESSARY, change of pace for your boyfriend to hear no judgements from you--just sheer belief and support. "I believe you" and"It's not your fault" should be your twin mantras from now on. Warning: your partner's story may come in different versions, and he may even contradict himself. Just keep listening and supporting him, without challenging him on the details. Memory is a tricky thing, particularly when it's linked to such a traumatic event, with often shameful overtones.  5) Ask open-ended questions ("And how did that feel?") as opposed to yes/no questions. Listen waaay more than you talk. Let him guide the discussion. Don't rush in and offer tons of advice--he's the expert on himself.  6) Realize that if your boyfriend confronts his past, he will need enormous amounts of tact, support and caring from you. You have a tough role to fill, and your boyfriend will have too much on his plate to support you emotionally in this difficult situation. Get the support you need, but be VERY sensitive to your boyfriend's privacy. Don't, for example, go blabbing around the circle of your mutual friends. If you must confide in a friend, pick a very discreet person your boyfriend doesn't know.  Recovery from sexual abuse and assault is a long and difficult process. Very serious trust, intimacy, and sexuality issues are par for the course. You and your boyfriend need much more information and help than I could cram into this little column. I STRONGLY recommend going to a therapist skilled in sexual abuse issues.  Also, you may want to check out some books on the topic. The bible in this field is  The Courage to Heal , by Ellen Bass and Laura Davis. Sadly, it's oriented toward female survivors. They have a bit of a franchise, so you can check out their other books as well. You could also look at  Outgrowing the Pain: A Book for and About Adults Abused As Children  by Eliana Gill. One book I've heard recommended for partners is Ken Graber's  Ghosts in the Bedroom: A Guide for the Partners of Incest Survivors .
