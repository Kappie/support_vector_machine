I think we cleared thisall out last night...well, for the most part. So let's just drop it. I enjoy being angry but I'm not too keen on the aftereffects.  Alex and them were planning on rolling us last night. I didn't know this, however, Alex told me today. Then they got lost. I laughed. That bunch of dumbasses...I really fucking hate them sometimes, I don't know why I hang around them anymore.  I know it sounds kind of snide and uppity but I really get tired of "let's work out!", "fast food, good!", and "we're trying so damned hard to fit in we're sticking out like a sore thumb!". FUCK! Alex really really enjoys gloating about what a great time he had working out, egging people (as he did last night, and he went on for about fifteen minutes), eating something of a sub-standard make, or having no life. And I get really sick of it, and being human, start to emulate it. He's been around a lot lately so I've been taking on pieces of him.  Sometimes I can't stand myself. And other times I eat cupcakes.
