I've been at daddy's since yesterday morning and am having a nice time, as long as I don't think about the burning scraping excruciating pain throbbing in my right ear.    it was killing me yesterday, so mom dragged me to the emergency room and after a three hour wait and an exam from a doctor with very, very spiky hair, I found out I have an inner and outer ear infection. Now folks, I've thrown my back out, I've gotten migraines, I've sprained wrists and ankles, and I've never never never felt so much pain as I have with this infection. It is simply... Agonizing in the deepest sense of the word.    so this is the worst thing I've ever felt, right? So knowing me the only logical thing to follow would be that the painkillers don't work. Well, they just fucking don't. In fact, I took one on an empty stomach this morning and I hit the floor. Actually I got to a chair and only blacked out for a few seconds, but still, I've never had that happen before. The drugs don't work, the eardrops don't work, so all I can do is pump up with antibiotics and OTC stuff. Needless to say, I'm a-suffering.    I'm a-suffering and am also a bit annoyed with all these people clamoring over me. I mean, yeah it would be nice if I passed out that you wouldn't let me hit my head on something, but I'm FINE. I-AM-FINE and even though my ear is killing me it doesn't mean I need to be quarantined.    that's basically it Iguess.stay tuned.
