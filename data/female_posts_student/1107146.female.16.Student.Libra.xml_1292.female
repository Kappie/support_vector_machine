And at one point we played monkey in the middle with a huge paper ball, and I didn't fail my French exam, HURRAY. And then Alex and I had a session and didn't get anything done, and we had Taco Bell, and it was awesome.  And right now, I made a new BLog so as to log the huge post...it's huge, and really weird...a lot of me talking in the past using my thoughts, random snippets of songs that I throw in here and there. It isn't a great idea to be writing this thing at two in the morn, so I'm going to put it off for a while and see what I can do tomorrow night.  Eleven sounds good to me. Dress up? BONUS.
