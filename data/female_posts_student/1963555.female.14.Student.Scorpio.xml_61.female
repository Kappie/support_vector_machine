Now normally I would ignore it and wanna be anti-social, which is okay, but I've done it most of my life and with the new year coming I think it's time for some fucking changes! I used to think that fate would do everything for me or whatever but now I'm seeing it ain't gonna happen. And I like to think of myself as independent so I'm taking this whole new year to make some big ass changes... I',m gonna get my grades passing, not let ass holes bother me so much, be more social (not like the retarded cheerleaders but more nice and talk to people I wouldn't of normally) be a bit more outgoing, get it? I'm defenitly gonna change things and corney as this whole paragraph sounds... I need new stuff going on this year sucked and I refuse to just sit around and let things come to me, I need to go out and get them if I want it. So starting 2004 fuck the old year, begin the new... I'm sorry for every one who thought this post to be retarded or wierd or gay, whatever. But for christmas I got...... Simple Plan concert tickets!!!! Score YEAH!!!! I can't wait my second concert by them!!!!! UHHHHHHHHH I love David!!, that made no sence between the two subjects but hey, your part of it..... ha ha American Hearts
