I mean, if you know you gotta do a report on a rather boring subject, then you get your ass moving and start looking for some visual materials or whatever.. and if you can't find that, you try to organize your thoughts nice and clearly on hand-outs or something.. and the least you can do is to raise your voice from time to time to keep people awake.. well.. those three guys did NONE of it.. it was a damn stuffy room, these guys kept talking as if they were intentionally trying to talk themselves to sleep, and in their PowerPoint presentations they used endless, complete sentences instead of keywords.. damn, this is an upper-level seminar and these dorks don't even know how to give a presentation.. I mean, I'm not very good at it, but if I know it's gonna be hard to keep people's attention, then I won't make matters worse by committing all those errors these guys did..   so, I sat there and tried to listen to the speakers, but in fact, it was more interesting to watch our teacher trying very hard not to fall asleep himself. I bet he was wishing he hadn't decided to teach this class.. after 2 of the three speakers he decided to give us all a break and so I used the chance and left completely.. (several people had already done so before, while the guys were speaking).  Seriously, I'm in the middle of my exam preparations and I don't wanna waste my time sitting around and listening to fricking stupid presentations.. I would've learned more if I had read the Chomsky book myself..   in fact, this whole class sucks.. during the first session, I thought, yeah, it's gonna be great.. the class is about Media and Terrorism, and the teacher knows more than I will probably ever know about this subject matter.. but what's pissing me off is that this is an upper-level class and there's not even a single book or article that we have to read! sure, we got a bibliography but it's all voluntary and since the university system in Germany sucks, hardly any of the students will read any of the books.. so, the class basically consists of students giving presentations.. some of them are good, yeah, but most of them suck... but since attendance is obligatory, I have to show up regularly.. usually, I manage to sneak out after half of it, though, but it's a waste of time going there anyway..   so, after this, I was already quite pissed.. then a friend told me that there had been schedule changes for one of my other classes, and without going into details, the long story short is that it sucks.. so, negative message number two..  then, I actually had the chance to listen to an interesting talk by an American historian on Buffalo Soldiers and stuff like this.. the guy used to work in the Pentagon and if I remember correctly, he has been writing about and researching buffalo soldier issues for 30 years.. so, he seemed to be quite an expert, and, believe me, after this talk in my morning class, his report was like paradise.. he had slides and some short clips from movies, and he was speaking fluently and clearly, and there was no way someone could fall asleep..   after that, I chatted with a friend for almost an hour, and we both agreed on most matters regarding the quality of our studies here.. so, basically, for one hour, we talked about everything that was annoying us, and while this was a good way to get rid of some anger, it also made it clear to us that many things suck around here.. and the result was that I went home being even more pissed..   now, that I've thought about it for a while, I think it's mostly because of mr right.. I haven't heard from him yet (what a surprise) and it just sucks to be away from the center of action right now and to not have the chance to influence things directly.. if he was here, I'd probably love my life no matter how many stupid presentations I'd have to listen to..  I don't know what to do about it tho.. he doesn't seem to check his emails often (at least not the addies I'm writing to) and it's hard to reach him via phone, too.. so, I guess, if I meet him online next time, and provided this girl he's interested in turned him down, I'll just lay all my cards open.. I should probably promise this with witnesses present; otherwise, I'll prolly be too afraid to tell him everything.. so, let's make it official.. next time's the right time!  alright.. I guess, I'm heading towards my bed now.. time to finish this stupid day..  night everyone!
