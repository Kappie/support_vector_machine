       
      I just got back from the lord of the rings, and that is all I will tell you about it. Go see it yourself and draw your own conclusions. All I have to say is "oh.my.god."   today I felt like I was in a dream. every time I would see heidi she would tell me how long until the movie started, even if it had only been minutes since I had last seen her. then after the movie, we went outside to wait for her mom, but after a minute decided to brave the cold inside. I was shivering so hard I couldn't find my balance, and had to lean against the wall. it's been hard to think straight.   MEOW!
