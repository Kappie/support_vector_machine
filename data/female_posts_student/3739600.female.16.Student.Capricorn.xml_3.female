I try so hard to be the perfect child both of them want me to be but it's just not me. I don't have the normal teen life all the others do. I don't go to the movies every Friday night, I don't go to the occasional birthday party, nor do I go hang out at the mall with my friends. I turn down offers to go to schlitterbahn or six flags and I barely talk on the phone anymore. I try not to ask for too much and I am always keeping to myself. But My dad just has to find something to stick on me. He always brings up the past and the stupid things I have done. Yes I know I make mistakes but with that I ask for your forgiveness and plus it's over with and he should learn to let them go. Even when I'm not bothering anybody and I am sitting in my room, he will get all upset because I am always in my room. But when I'm not in my room we always get into confrontations. So I don't know what to do. And see the worst thing is when my mom tries to stand up for me. When she does, she and my dad get in to these huge arguments. Once I turn 18, I think it were best if I were to get out of this house as soon as possible. I love my parents and you know I wouldn't be able to live knowing I split them apart. As it is I hate knowing that I am the main reason for all the tension I this house hold. So Lord, please help me and please don't leave my side.       Love Always, Brandi*
