And they were freshly cleaned, so it was a little bit of a snooze button morning. We showered and grabbed coffee and left as quickly as we could, and I was only slightly later than expected. I got home and read a bunch for Colonialism and Culture seminar, and then ran to American Political History. We talked about the election and presidency of Zachary Taylor. The funny part of that is when I was little my dad's friend had a dog named Zachary Taylor, and for the longest time I didn't really know that the dog was named after an actual historical figure. I just thought it was funny that the dog had a last name. But that dog had the temperament to be named for a general/president. He was a gruff old dog!  Anyway, finished the reading, wrote up my response and went to seminar, where I actually talked and said some stuff about the topic. Next week I present, so I need to email the girl who I'm supposed to work with. I'm sure we'll just divide it up and make sure we both know what to talk about, and it'll be great. I think I'll make up some discussion questions and maybe look up some kind of visual--we're talking about hook swinging and sati, so maybe it'll be more intriguing to see images of what the British were so offended by. Hmm.  Then Melissa called and we went to the grocery store together. It was just like old times, except we didn't have to steal a cart from across the street and go up the elevator with it like at Lakeshore. Oh well. We then got dinner at Dos, which is always tasty. Now I need to have some alone time with the bathroom... bye!
