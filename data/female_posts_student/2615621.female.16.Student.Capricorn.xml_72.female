I wrote this down for you.  Not because you’re leaving, just because we like you.  Yeah, just because we like you.   That was the last great thing I ever had.  Hope you remember that.   Who’s going to be around with me?   We wrote this down for you.  Not because you’re leaving, just because we like you.   And if my fingers should start to crack or blister, I guess that’s just what happens.  Don’t forget the things you’re leaving.  i love limbeck!!! rock on limbeck!!! they played a show with hot vegas...haha just thought i'd add that in there.
