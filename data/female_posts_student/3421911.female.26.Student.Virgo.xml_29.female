I dragged Beth’s butt away because we wouldn’t exactly see some action with anyone in the gay area.  It was a very long walk but I walked it, alongside Beth, of course.  She couldn’t exactly walk behind me for fear of being mistaken as my “yaya”.  We could already hear Kitchie Nadal howling which was a sign that the alternative bands weren’t too far away anymore. It’s too bad we couldn’t see the band from where we were standing.  Not only was Kitchie hot, but she had an even hotter bassist. We arrived in the Raja Sulayman fountain area just as Session Road was setting up.  Had to check if the housemates were still at Shakey’s where I sampled their leftover pizza.  Saw Jeffrey Hidalgo with his posse on the way in.  He looks better in person; TV appearances don’t give the guy justice.      After saying goodbye to my housemates, Beth and I went out to see Session Road perform.  I kept on telling Beth how good the band was when I saw them perform at Xaymaca.  I really like their original stuff. We had to look for an okay spot; we were so tired of standing up.  We finally did find a spot, next to the jolog rockers just as the Itchyworms were starting their set.  I enjoyed their set.   Beth was enjoying herself although she kept on texting the boyfriend, trying to make him envious of all the bands we were watching play that night.  She was telling me how she absolutely adores bassists and how hot she gets whenever she watches the boyfriend play with his bass guitar.  “Makes me want to jump on him right then and there”, were her words.  Too much info, sweetie.  Sugarfree performed next and while I wasn’t really familiar with some of the new songs that they played, I looked forward to their new album.  I didn’t hear  Unang Araw  and  Telepono , but  Mariposa  kicks ass talaga.      After Sugarfree performed and the next band, Sandwich, was doing sound check, I kinda hinted to Beth that since this was a Studio23 shindig, Marc Abaya wasn’t gonna show up, Marc being an MTV VJ.  But when the guy said”Check!” I knew it was him.  It was Marc!!! The stupid guy VJ whom we couldn’t really see kept on talking about Sandwich in reference to their new single,  Two Trick Pony .  It was as if it was the only Sandwich song he knew because the man kept on displaying his ignorance.    They started their set with my all-time favorite  Butterfly Carnival , from the first album  Grip, Stand, Throw .  Jeez, these jolog rockers talaga, after all these years and after all the frigging mosh-pitting and they still can’t get the fucking lyrics right.  Beth wasn’t too familiar with the Sandwich songs anymore so I had to “voice over” every time a new song was done.  They played  Right Now , from their indie album  Thanks to the Moon’s   Gravitational Pull .  It was during this song that something peculiar happened:  a guy wearing nothing but his white underwear and a left shoe (? this is according to Beth, ‘coz I couldn’t really see anymore) stood in the middle of the remaining road open (they had to close the south bound road to make way for the audience), raising his hands and dancing to the tune of Sandwich until nobody was paying attention to the band anymore.  Scene-stealer. Hmp.   For a while, the mosh pit cleared because everybody was surrounding this guy, and traffic was already bad enough as it is.  He went on until Nahuhulog was playing and then he was covered by so many people we didn’t see him anymore.  Sandwich ended their set with, yes, now you can say it, you stupid VJ,   Two Trick Pony  .  I sooo love Marc Abaya!!!     The main event was Kapatid, led by Karl Roy.  I wonder if he’s still dating Mariel.  Anyway, their set was good too.  I asked Beth to walk with me as we were listening to Karl because I didn’t want to get mobbed as soon as everybody left.  They did  Ang Himig Natin  and, to my surprise, an old P.O.T. song,  Fishcake , before ending the whole event with  Pagbabalik ng Kuwago .  It was a good thing God let the rains pour only after the show ended.  I didn’t want to get wet again.  at least, not that way anyway :)
