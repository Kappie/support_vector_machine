So chances are I'm not going.   On the bright side, I am uber proud of myself because I was soo smart and already figured out where to go for classes by the second day, so I only used the map and schedule for the first day of school.  Our school is super huge too, so that must be like a world record or something for figuring out your schedule.  LOL.   Something that makes me mad though is the fact that I already have, like, serious homework, and lots of it, on just the third day of school.  We're talking a paper for English, numbering measures on five songs for Orchestra, tons of Math homework, a poem thingy for Spanish, an article for Health, a test in English next Friday (so that means I have to study), and there are a few other things I can't think of right this moment.  This weekend my family MIGHT be going to the Indiana State Fair, though we're not sure.  I hope we do go, cuz I've never been, and we've been living here since I was in fifth grade. :(  Also, I am going to youth group with Anna Sunday night, so that should be fun.  I have to call Jaime cuz i haven't seen her in three months and I just saw her two times today and she told me to call her.  And Oprah today should be, how should I word this, interesting.  I don't know the word for it, but I want to watch it.  It's about this woman who was held captive in this millionaire's basement for a reeeeally long time, and how later when she tried to tell police about it, they wouldn't believe her.  And so I should get off now, cuz it's gonna start in 5 minutes.  I'll post later.
