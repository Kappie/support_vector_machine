Then i had a nice chat with Huiping and Jaslin.. It really seemed like very long since we had a nice chat.. I really cant believe that Huiping actually converted to a Christian! Well.. i had nothing to say but i cant imagine that the one who used to tell me that she believe in Buddhism and even quarrel with Jaslin over this issue actually converted now!! HaiZz.. Today while chatting with Huiping, i suddenly found that only within 2weeks we didnt seen each other, she changed.. I dunno how to say it but jus feel kinda disappointed when she told me she cant meet me tml.. Actually kinda look forward to meeting her.. Still remember that we used to meet to chat abt our lives, thoughts but things seemed to changed... Oh yah.. i just read a book called FlyingDance.. Very romantic and sweet.. Really gave me a lot of thoughts.. In this book, it said abt a phrase in Titanic which really touch my heart that is:"Rose, listen to me.. Listen... Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.. It bought me to you... And i'm thankful... Rose... I'm thankful..." Well suddenly i start questioning myself that how many times in life that we ever told someone we love that we are thankful that we get to meet them? Well for me i am just someone who dun really noe how to express myself thru words... And often i live in regret in many things.. I simply let opportunity bypass me...But that's jus me rite? Haha.. today i oso gain alot of knowledge! I read some books in the library and actually found that the story TROY is a real story and i am so impressed these ancient civilisation.. I really a little of Julius Cesar and Alexander the great and was really impressed by these 2 men.. Oh ya.. i oso saw picture on Paris.. Wow.. its so beautiful.. Haha.. when i married, i am going to Paris for my honeymoon.. That's my dream.. I loved to dream.. Dream about someday being a teacher, being a businesswomen.. And then married.. Wearing a glass slippers jus like Cinderalla.. Actually i really hope for a fairy tale love.. It doesnt had to last but i just hope it occur once in my life time..
