This summer I was suppose to get my second cartilage but it's sorta too late for that because I have soccer in August where I'll have to take it out so I might as well just wait til after the season. But the other day, I realized I could play soccer with my belly button pierced... So I brought up that idea with my mom. At first, she seemed like she was considering it and it could be a possibility but then she got all mad at me for asking. She was like, "Why do you always bring this up?" That was the second time I ever asked her about my belly button! I just want a good reason from her and I can handle waiting. But my mom's so called "good" reason: "I don't wanna be responsible for a major infection." But she was willing to be responsible for a major infection in my cartilage. Which did happen by the way and she was the one freaking out. Sigh. I don't see what's so bad about it. She even told me I had to wait til I'm 18 to get it pierced. And that pissed me off. I work my ass off in school, I'm fucking class president, I play a bunch of sports, I don't smoke, I don't have sex...it my opinion, I'm a pretty good kid. And I feel I should be rewarded for those things. God knows, my parents hardly say how proud of me they are and I'm by far the best child academically. I'm counting down the years until I can go away to college. I can't wait. I'm only coming back for Christmas and that's it. I don't wanna live here the rest of my life. This isn't the place for me. I don't belong here. My mom doesn't understand that I need to experiment with things and find out who I really am. She's too busy worrying about images. That's why she won't let me dye my hair. Piercings, hello, they come out. No one has to know what you have pierced. I wish I could talk to you about stuff in my life but every time I try she either ignores me, doesn't remember, or lectures me about it rather than being supportive. Oh and another thing. I feel like the biggest loser. The only person that ever invites me to do anything is Annie. Everyone else? It's like I'm non-existent to them. It's quite ridiculous in my opinion. Because then I feel used because people always call me to get other people's phone numbers, or doing school they just use me to get homework, or rides home when we go out. It's so crazy. I mean, since when does everyone hate me and why? What did I ever do to them? Margaret says they're just jealous of me but I feel like there's not much to be jealous of. But she admitted to feeling jealous of me at times. I don't know it's a screwed up world. And I hate when people act like they know you and know things inside of you, like why you act the way you do. And tell me you know your right and you don't have to tell me because I already know. Sorry if that doesn't make much sense to you guys but I don't feel like explaining the whole situation. I just hate that someone thinks they know me so well as to know how I'm feeling at this very moment. Ya never know, I might just surprise ya...
