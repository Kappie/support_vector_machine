We were storm chasers watching lightning blaze out of heaven huddled under the safety of our blankets.    We were adventurers spending half a night in tree forts before succumbing to “hypothermia”.  We were psychics channeling restless spirits via Ouija boards, promising not to push the pointer on penalty of possession.    We were romantics hopelessly in love with J.T.T. bickering over who he would marry first and who would get the sloppy seconds.  We were philosophers not caring about the real world, just enjoying childhood like retired seniors.  We were the strongest of the strong, bravest of the brave and the most unemployed of them all.
