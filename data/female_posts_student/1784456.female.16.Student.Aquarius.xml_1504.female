We were drinking them while watching the end 1 1/2 hours of Titanic on BBC1. I love that film, makes me weepy tho *SOB* *SOB*. My mum was going on about how Kate Winslet (who plays rose incase u didn't no) is such a good role model for young girls cos she ain't fat but she's not really skinny either. And i was sat there going 'Jack (played by Leo Dicaprio) can't die, its not fair!' Kez there is nothing worng with shopping especially not shoe shopping and trying on shoes u can't walk in! I am going shopping in broadmead tomorrow. I went saturday with my mum and bought Xtina Aguilera's Album and then Samantha called and asked if i wanted to go tomorrow so i thought yeah stuff it i'll go! FUN FUN!!!
