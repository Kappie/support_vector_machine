No matter how empty the theatre might be, someone always feels the need to sit down either in the row directlyin front of me (thus preventing me from putting my feet up) or directly behind me.  It really is annoying, because 1) I really don't like to be around strangers that much, and that is why I am choosing to go an sit in a dark theatre for two hours, and 2) these are often the very people who have obnoxious theatre behavior (e.g., eating popcorn loudly, talking, etc).  This happened to me yesterday when I went to go see  A Cinderella Story  (groan, but I do love Jennifer Coolidge). My friend, Kristin, and I had taken our seats somewhere in the middle of the theatre. Just as the movie was starting, a group of three young boys (YES! boys! I usually am not one to impose arbitrary gender stereotypes upon people, but dudes, you just saw a Hilary Duff movie! And they weren't old enough to be going merely because she is hot) sat immediately in the seats behind us, despite the theatre being virtually empty.  Kristin and I exchanged a look that communicated that things were about to take a turn for the worse, and they did. The boy seated behind me felt it necessary to lean forward and eat his popcorn loudly in my ear. Popcorn-eating in general is sort of a pet peeve of mine in that the noise of people crunching on it drives me crazy, so I really didn't like that the crunchingoccurred about 6 inches from my ear.  Then, surprise! surprise! They talked throughout the whole fucking movie! I turned around a few times (okay, a lot!), interchanging evil glances, loud sighs, and a somes "Shusshes", but nothing seemed to work.  Finally, I just succumbed to the fact that nothing would prevent them from ruining my movie experience, and just resolved to try and block it out as much as possible, using the same technique employed when ignoring my dad as a teenager.  In spite of something similar to this happening nearly everytime I go to the movies, I still must go. There is something still so purely wonderful about the lights going down, the previews, and completely forgetting about the outside world for 1.5-2 hrs.  Plus, the manager at my movie theatre is HAWT. I am serious, even though I have never spoken with him, I am in love with him. One time, that one precious time, he took my ticket, and our fingers ended up touching, and I swear to God, there was electricity.
