It was a really good episode! About Trudy's dad (Monks father-in-law), who is the producer of a game show, and how he thinks someone is cheating on his game show. How Monk figured it out was really awesome!!!! Really so then I came back and watched just a little bit of the Olympics b/c I was really tired. Guess what I realized to? I missed Great Britain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's like a kick in the butt for me! But then I went to bed. I had a really weird dream about school, the office, Greek vocab words, and lockers. I no really weird. Then I woke up this morning at like 9:20 then I receided to watch some TV so I did, while eating my yogurt and toaster strudels! Gotta love em! Then I went and tried to play roller coaster tycoon on my computer but for those of you who don't no my computer its really slow! Like not kidding slow and IM on my computer takes like longer than it does in a slow chat room when your response is delayed. Then I talked to Rae. she helped me w/ some stuff. Now i'm here. I read Mickey's blog and I am really proud of you!!!!!! B/c its normally so short but now its like um.. not! Just really long and wow! Yea so I think I'm going to go to the Mall today b/c I need to get a present. And, I have to babysit from 5:30-10! woohoo....not. There are two kids. One who I babysit for all the time and the other is 3 months old!!!!! What am I supposed to do w/ her? I think she will go to bed around 6ish anyways so I don't really have to worry about her but for that 1/2 hour? Can they even hold their own heads up yet? I have no idea!! So yea ice cream social on the first day of school woohoo! I like ice cream and school starts MONDAY!!!!! well I think this is long enough. later
