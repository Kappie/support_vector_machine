So Georgia is awesome, you should know that by now.   You need to feed her at nine o’clock, noon and four. All she eats is a [little] teaspoon of the wet food all smooshed up so it’s easy to chew.   Lets see, give her some water every once-in-a-while and plop her in the cat box on the hour(ish). Hopefully she won’t take a dump on your carpet or something, that would be depressing.   Other than that she’s pretty .ea.s.y. Be gentle, but don’t worry about messing around with her – She’s a tough cookie. ^.^ /meow/  I’ll stash some of her kitty treats in with her as well, if she looks a little famished just remember this; ‘Dooooo it!’ Oh yeah. Best advice ever.  Hum. What else … She loves to chill with you, so just let her on your lap whenever you have a chance.   .Wa.r.n.in.g: Major bonding sessions ahead.  I don’t know what to tell you. Have fun. Be safe. Use protection. [Haha, gross. Please don’t have sex with poor little Georgia, it might be a little traumatic for her.]  W00t. You’re my hero.  - The Teenster.  + + + +  I've got to get through this.   Why am I so goddamn attached?
