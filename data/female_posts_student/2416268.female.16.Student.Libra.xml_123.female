Now I sit a couple of months away from my 17th and I ask myself, "What exactly have I done this year?"...and he answer would be nothing....ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING....except eat far to much food! Wow...that will be a great thing to tell people when they ask "What have you been up to in your holidays?"...  "Oh me.....I ate far to much food and got even fatter than I already was.....HA"  ----------------------------------  See what I mean about all consuming, its always in my thoughts, I would say it is possibly my only unhappy...well not unhappy....but.....oh I don't no the word to describe it...annoying possibly.....thought!  ----------------------------------  Woohooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo      the good ol' sun is here........but for how long......hmmm "Stormy Weather on the way"...what is the point in weathermen...they only spoil the summer.......  see i think that if you wernt told all the time that rain is on the way, or it has been a washout summer, then people would look past the grey skies, and enjoy the energy that summer brings, if they let sunshine into there heart then in return this would please the Summer Fairies and they would make the sun outside, aswell as in your....or maybe I mean my.....heart!!!!  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
