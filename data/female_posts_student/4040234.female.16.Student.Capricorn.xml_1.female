I think about what I've gone through w/ guys, the abusement, the hurt feelings EVERYTHING!!!   It's really hard to see the good in any guy after so much shit happens.  And that's when things go wrong.  I went to the club tonight w/ carm, ry, and marissa.  I also met 2 awesome guys.  I dissed the one, I feel really bad, and i didnt mean to i was just kidding.  But he took it serious and left.  I ended up chasing him to the parking lot and we talked then i called him and we talked some more.  And he's really awesome.  I feel bad because I have my guard up 24/7. It's sooo hard for me to trust guys, then when i find decent ones I act like a moron and diss them. Whats a girl to do.  It's hard.  So i met Nate.  He was cool, i dissed him and i dunno why.  I acted like I was drunk.  I guess i was just frontin so if he dissed me i wouldnt feel stupid.  Those quotes up there ^ thats what he said to me.  I also met Paul.  Joe's friend.  He's cool, I havent talked to him as much.  He wants to chill tom. i dunno if that gonna work because He wants me to meet him in green tree and i forsure cant drive.  lol.  So i dunno... They're both really cute, and they both drive, which is fucking AWESOME.  But i dunno what i should do.      So anywayz we go to club zoo, and we meet marissa and joe and paul there.  It was ass... we sat in the parking lot for like 2 hours.  Then Nate and his crew came and we talked and finally decided we would make our own party up in there.  So we figure there will be at least 30-40 people there.  NO... there was 4 ppl in there.  4 FUCKING PEOPLE.  So we go in a stand around for a while.  so then me carm and marissa start dancing and the whole Nate thing happens.  Then we went out side and messed around w/ everyone.  I was talking to Nate and Paul off and on.. Then carm, ry, marissa, and me went to funfest... left 2 mins later, and went to eat n park.  That was fun the food was gross.  So then some lame asses start harassing marissa so we fuck w/ them for 45 mins.  So the night was just great... But Nate called me and we talked for a while... he's really sweet.  But he lives sooo far away!! omg... so does paul.. They both live like 30-45 mins away... It sux ass... grrr.. go figure... so me and carm... have decided not to drink tonight.. this will be our first sober night together!!! it's kinda lame... lol ok well we're out.. i'm dying here!! NIGHT
