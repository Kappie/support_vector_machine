Your comments would be most appreciated.  So today at work was ok.  Nine hours is rather long though, I don't know how the office people do it every day with out losing their insanity.  Part time is good enough for me.  So I've given Pride and Prejudice a chance so I have a reason to say this, its a harder book than some to get through.  I'm only half way, and I only have until Monday.  I had this huge spat with one of my friends but its over now.  What a relief...and that's all I have to say about that.
