I shameslessely lead people on. I act half my age, and still expect people to love me. I'm the meanest person ever, and then I have the nerve to sit around and wonder why I'm not with someone, and why I'm alone Saturday night. I have a shameful dating record. 12 boyfriends and nothing to show but a few broken hearts, and a scar on my leg. I'm such a mean person.  And if I ever had the choice of picking between my boyfriend and a crush that wanted me, I would dispose of the one I loved for however long, and take up the crush, however shortlived it would be. I'm so ashamed. So exposed.  So take your pot-shots at me. I'll sit here, and take it. I deserve all of it.
