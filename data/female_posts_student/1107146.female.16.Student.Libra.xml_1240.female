Then that afternoon I have to finish a Research paper, do a conic and review packet for pre-calc, do so shopping for amanda's present, and prolly some gardening. On Sunday it's Mother's Day so I'll be at church from 7:45 to about 11:15. Then my dad will prolly take me to practice my driving and at 5pm I will have to go to church again for a dress rehersal that I can NOT miss. So if you can find a dot in that schedule where I can meet I would be happy to.   The weekend after that starts like this: Friday night I'll be at Erika's Graduation Open House and prolly will be there til 12 or so. Then Sat at 10am I will perform for the end-of-the-year program at Ekin. Then I will have my piano lesson and then start stressing about exams again but supposedly that is also when the will-josh-becca b-day party is. We'll prolly also have some kind of bible study gathering because it'll be out last devos week together before we break for summer. Then on Sunday church is 8-10:30. At night it's like 5-8 since that's our performance.   The weekend after that is Piano and then at 3-5 is Amanda's Grad. Open House. Then Sunday we'll have the usually stuff. That weekend I think is also the weekend before exams so yeah you all know me so my stress level will be around 99% full.  Yes I know I sound like I don't want to talk to her because of my busy schedule but honestly i wish i could do it but i'm not going to screw up the schedule that has been set for a couple of weeks now. She was a friend and i think that i need to get on with my life.
