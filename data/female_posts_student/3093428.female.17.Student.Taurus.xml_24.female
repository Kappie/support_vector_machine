I got all the stuff in the politics and geography sections, but the WW1 and WW2 sections pretty much kicked my ass. Oh well. I think I've done well enough in class during the year, that I won't completely bomb my final Socials mark. I have French and Biology tomorrow, which'll be a hoot and a half.  When my mom drove me to school this afternoon for my Socials exam, I passed the Westminster and Garden City intersection and I saw Dyllan and a bunch of other kids walking to the church. Made me wish all my exams were done. Like now. Boooo.  I kinda feel like swimming, but I can't 'cause I gotta study more after this post. And I found two t-shirts in my closet the other day. I wore them when I was a little kid, but hey, they still fit, so I wore one of them today and I felt so rad.
