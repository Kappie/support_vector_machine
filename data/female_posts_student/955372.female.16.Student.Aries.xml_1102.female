I'm gonna put like three posts in one because um, I don't know if I'm going to be able to load this page again. Yeah I watched Changing Rooms last night (the british version of Trading Spaces, Changing Rooms came first and is MUCH better, BBC america is my life) and I've decided that my goal in life is to either be Handy Andy's (the designated carpenter) assistant, or replace Handy Andy when the show starts to go south and he bails. But yeah that is definitely my goal. I could be like "the american" yeah. And there was something else I wanted to say. Oh well couldn't have been that important.
