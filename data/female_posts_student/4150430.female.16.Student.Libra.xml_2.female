After, we went to walmart and got a bunch of  school supplies. We came home and cleaned the house then later my mom took us to the fair, which was fun cept i wore flip flops and they got comlpetly soked in mud! (sadly i knew it would happen) But my mom spent like 100 bucks on rides, food, games, and w/e else we got...oh yeah,  i got one of those glow neclaces, HOT stuff right thurr...       Sunday i got up and went to church, then my aunt and uncle came over and my uncle fixed our gutters(what a nice guy!) Then i washed my moms car and cleaned the inside, for free, cuz im just such a nice daughter ya know....hehe. Then theres today...well i woke up to my brother shaking me because my mom called the SPCA and told them that she found this dog and that she needs to get rid of him...which is a lie...for one its MY dog and she wants to get rid of him just because hes too big and to much to handle. Well now im freakin pissed cuz shes droppin him off on weds unless we find him a home...well thats about it for my weekend...oh yeah my toe still hurts...
