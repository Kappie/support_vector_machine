I just got back from Helena. Yesterday was insanely nice and sunny and I even got sunburned. But today it rained and was bone chillingly cold. Now my shoulder hurts like heck and I am sick again! This weekend just was not one of the best. Yeah anyway...there has to be something else to talk about. What to say what to say...did I mention that my shoulder hurts like heck?  She isn't even away now! She signed off! EHHHH!!!!! Long distance relationships, even if they are between friends, suck! Yeah..kinda depressed... I think I need to go do something to get out of this mood...eat chocolate...that sounds good.
