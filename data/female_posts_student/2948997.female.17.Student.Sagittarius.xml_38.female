Maybe my thoughts are scary maybe my feelings are fucked...maybe it's just me.       I feel useless at work a lot of the time considering I don't know how to fucking do anything properly...and my boss is leaving me to do her job all Friday and for fucks sake... I'm a fucking retard who can't seem to get anything right. Hell... Breanne still isn't talking to me and you know what...I don't blame her.       Self-destruction or self-empathy.       Tonight at Rogers... I was confused. I was drawn into a parallel fucking universe where I shouldn't have been. I recieve a call from a customer, who is slightly amoured with me and well...seems he would like to take me out on a date. Is it because I'm happier now that people are finding me kinda of attractive or is it some desparate longing scent. I am happy... I would like to think that I'm happier. Having a constant challenge, a constant battle makes me strive for perfection.       Some days I wish I could write in french and not have to rely on the bloody translator. I want to write something here, but I look like an idiot if I do put it here.      Where and what and how and why and should I go from here.       I want him. I want the answers...but I'm almost not prepared for the questions.      Right now... my like is one. One incredible person. One incredible amazing person.       And if I had a superpower... I would read minds....and cure world hunger.
