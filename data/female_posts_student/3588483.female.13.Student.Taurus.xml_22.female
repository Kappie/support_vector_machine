I think manga is more fun than anime. maybe, its because i've read some wonderfully drawn manga, and then i get the anime of that manga, and it look so...messy! I think thats quite rude towards the mangaka/'s. Hisaya Nakayo is one of my fav mangaka. Clamp is just SO great too. They've made so many hits. Like Shirahime Syo, Lawful Drug,Magic Knight Rayearth, Card captor Sakura, X/1999, Clamp school detectives, man of many faces, Angelic layer...and so much more those I can't recall right now. ^.^ But they are so good. I dont know many other Hisaya nakayo's doings than Hanazakari no kimitachi e, and Inuyasha doujinshi. She must have strated her career with doing doujinshi...I went to a pet store and on the way there, I saw a snake O.O my dog was about to eat it until i realised it. I'm so BLIND x) I also saw a dead rat. (eww) Well anyway I hope they wont make a hanakimi anime! If its gorgeously draw...I dont mind, but I think hanakimi should stay as a manga. Its just better that way ;) Izumi, Shin, Nakatsu and Hokuto are so hot^.^ I heard umaeda hokuto's father named Azuma, is quite hottie too. he's 54 years old though, but he looks like he's in his twenties! I wanna see him *drooling already*
