I mean sometimes I wonder if teachers realize how hard it is to read thirty thousand chapters of a book in one night.  I know, I know it's not their problem that we have other class and other things to do when we get home. I know it's not their problem that we have exams and SOLs in classes other than theirs coming up that we are studying for. I know it's not their problem that their class isn't the only one packing on the homework right at the end of the year. But still.   I think...I don't want to jinx it by saying anything...but I think for the most part I'm in the clear for the rest of the year in Latin class. I asked Mr. Davis if we were going to be taking any tests between now and the exam and he said no, he planned on it earlier but can't anymore. I'm exempting from the exam so basically as long as I do my translation every night I don't have to pay attention anymore. I think. Can't be this good to be true though...
