She lived a full life.  She was 85.  She was the oldest girls of 8 kids.  Her mom passed away when her youngest brother was born.  She was 11.  She took over has "Mom" to her family until her dad past away at age 101.  She was a terrific lady.  She actually was the first person I meet in Alex's family.  He has a very special bond with her.  Unfortunately men have a hard time with these types of feelings.  Well that is the circle of life... Sometimes it just takes us by surprise when the age is so young.  Everyone should live the best way they can and remember that we are only here for a short time.  Have a good Monday night and...................God Bless and Be Good
