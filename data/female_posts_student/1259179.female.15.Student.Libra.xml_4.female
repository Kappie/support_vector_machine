And I feel really down. I am feeling very alone right now and I shouldn't. I have family and friends all around me. I also have God looking down on me and just that should be making me feel better but it doesn't.   Maybe I am the point that all the medication that I am on are starting to counter effect....I don't know... Maybe I just need rest...or just to write about it....   Anyways, the're are days like this once in a while and let's hope this one goes fast..   Have a great HAPPY day and....Be good
