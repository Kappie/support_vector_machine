You don't want to ask because if they're not angry and they're just having a bad week it might piss them off if you ask and you don't want to seem like that chick who is always like "Are you mad at me?"  I hate it when people ask me that when I am not actually angry.  But it is getting to the point where I want to ask and I keep holding out to see if I am wrong but this person is proving me right everyday... so the big question is... WHAT THE HELL DID I DO?
