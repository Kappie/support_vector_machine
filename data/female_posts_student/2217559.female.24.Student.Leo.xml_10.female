I am learning a lot and working so much1 I was able to go into port today and check out this small town of Ixtapa. It was really cool! I had lunch at this place called "the fat mermaid."  (And trust, there were pictures of really fat mermaids everywhere!)  I had two coronas and took the tender back to the boat. Had a couple of hours off and I am now back at work untl aorund 9. My schedule rocks!!  I make my hours and I get to hang out with tons of people. My cabin is okay right but I will moving into the current social hostess' room once she leaves on Friday. It is really really small. Why oh why did i bring so many clothes! I am meeting tons of people and my ship is huge. I am one of 10 americans on board- most everyone else is greek, russian, asian - it's really fun. My hotel manager is nice. I am considered an officer so I get to eat in the officer messroom. (Kind of like the navy, ey?) I keep getting lost on the ship though! There are 12 floors! It is soooo big!   Tomorrow we head to Manzanillo and it should be really fun. I am going to the beach with my coworker for most of the day and then I will work tomorrow night. Guys, this job is the best job I have ever had! Oh and for all the smokers out there - I bought a carton of smokes on board for $14.00. Everyone smokes!!!   All my love to everyone - I miss you all so much! Hi Paddy! Take care and please write when you can - shelly_marie_white@yahoo.com.
