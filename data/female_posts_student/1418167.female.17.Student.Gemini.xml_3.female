I stayed up until 3:15 last night doing all sorts of good deeds... I cleaned out the pantry! It was fun... Paul complained that they don't make a "Nutrition for Men" oatmeal, cause he likes the "Nutrition for Women" Vanilla and Cinnamon one. "Well Paul, maybe someday the world will be fair for men and you can have Vanilla Cinnamon oatmeal. That'll be about the time that American gets a black, female,handicapped, lesbian president with a lisp."   Paul got me pretty well yesterday, seeing as I went ice skating with Sarah. And I ask you, is it right that three year olds and 70 year old grandfathers of 8 are going faster than me? I kept clinging to the wall for fear of falling, which promptly promoted Sarah to come up and go "Skate like this!" Whenever I managed to skate for a slightly longer period of time, she would go " You're doing it! You're doing it !" I did fall once but Sarah fell too so I wouldn't feel alone. Good kid. :) When I came home, I took one look at Paul, said " ow ," and crashed on the couch.   Stephanie came over last night as well and showed me the most disturbing cartoon I've ever seen. It's these cute little characters who all of a sudden become psychotic and start killing each other... ugh it's so gross. She kept wanting to watch another one, however, I prevented it, seeing as she had just scarred  my entire childhood . We also played the "monkeys jumping on the bed" game on Sarah's bed which was delivered yesterday. Dude, the guy who delivered it looked just like Shaft. So as soon as he walked out the door, Kelly and I went "Shaft!  Damn straight ..."  For those of you who have not heard, after Kerry's 55 minute, poorly delivered speech was over, on CNN, you could hear the people who were supposed to drop the balloons going "Go balloons! No balloons!  What the fuck are you guys doing down there?"   GENIUS!  I love this country. However, I do think the Clintons kick Kerry's butt when it comes to public speaking.  Stephanie, Kelly, and I are having a girls' day tomorrow-  yay!  It shall be very fun, I imagine. For now, I have to go get ready to take the girls to Chuck E. Cheese's... and I only had four hours of sleep... kwsuhgtwsr....btw, I made up with someone last night... long time coming, that.    Tu me manques.
