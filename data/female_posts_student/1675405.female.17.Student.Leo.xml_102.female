It really drove me nuts; indeed, I don't like to talk about myself, but I sure as hell don't want to talk about her perfect boy hours on end. And it gets a little tiring when I hear the "sexcapades" of others who attend Jefferson, and all the while Marie and her not-so-comforting voice saying "you need to meet a guy like John." I need to meet a guy who doesn't call often, and gets angry when you mention it; I need a guy who doesn't really place me high on his priority list. Um... yeah, I went through that, and frankly, it's not worth my time and expense of emotion.  I barricaded myself in Matthew's room all afternoon, watching movies and roasting in the stifling heat. Not bad, actually. "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" often frequents my list of "must-sees;" who can resist a love story that verges on surreal-- complete with the physical transformation from the ugly duckling to the swan, the introduction to the perfect man who loves the not-so-perfect woman, and the almost fantastical blossoming of the close-minded family to a friendly "free for all"? Definitely a must see.   So here I am, yet again, continuing my seemingly pointless college search. My time is running out, and thus my patience is weaning as well.
