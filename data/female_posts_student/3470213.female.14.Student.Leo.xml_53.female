Brody means brother and Jackson means son of Jack which is a form of John which means God is Gracious, Merciful. and i will probably get to see him in a week or so in which i will visit them and probably spend a day or so.   i think i will go to my grandpa jerry's soon or sumwhere else. i might go see a movie with steve and his girlfriend, kelly, today if he ever gets up. probably garfield. i am gonna see if i can get a hold of one of my friends today........adios!
