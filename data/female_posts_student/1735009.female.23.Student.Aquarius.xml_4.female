With him being from EBSCO and all, you would think that he'd give us a very biased talk about the wonders of EBSCO and talk down about their competitors.  He was actually very open-minded and mostly spoke in general terms about what we would face when we entered the library and a vendor would come up to us and give us their sales pitch.  There was some mention of competitors and the wonders of EBSCO, but for the most part, that was kept to a minimum and only mentioned when he was answering specific questions that people had.  What was most helpful and interesting was at the end, when we started grilling him about jobs and libraries, and all that stuff.  See, he has a MSLS from *gasp* Clarion.  So we started asking him real-life questions about the benefits of this program out in the real world.  What kinds of things he faced when he was working as a librarian rather than for an aggregator.  He was very frank and honest.  We liked that.  All in all, it was a very interesting class.  Scary that I didn't know what some things that he mentioned were.  Very scary.  Found out yesterday that the guy that usually teached Database Searching isn't going to teach it over the summer.  Rather, Basil, one of the librarians from downstairs in the library is going to teach it.  We're all questioning that.  We want Matt!  Yesterday I finally met Sharon, the librarian I've been corresponding with about the marketing webpage.  Went to the library to look at the pictures in order to pick a few out for the webpage.  Hopefully I'll finish that up tonight and forward it to her this weekend - Monday at the latest.
