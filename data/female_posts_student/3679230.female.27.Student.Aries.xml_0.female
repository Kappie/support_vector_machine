The best feeling I think I know is being between 7 and maybe 19, still being in school, and going to the library on a Saturday and coming back home with an enormous stack of books, unpacking them on the hallway floor and then try to decide which one to read first.  And then you end up taking two or three books with you because you just can't decide.  I went to the library yesterday and even though it wasn't a Saturday and I went on my own, it was still a good feeling to unpack those books.  I started reading three different books, I couldn't decide.  I never feel like that when I go to the library anywhere else, never felt like that in London, never in Ottawa, never feel like that in Melbourne.  I think that's because the libraries there seem so unloved with their 70s brown wall-to-wall carpet that's breeding mold and screaming kids who never learned you're supposed to be quiet in a library and people hanging around the computers, thinking using the internet is the reason you go to the library and the rows after rows with paperbacks which tell you whoever decides about what to buy needs to buy the cheapest possible.  I miss the peace and the bright and sunny buildings with plants and all the newly published books you can imagine.
