Not too proud of myself but my side was really starting to hurt so I had to stop at 17.42 minutes. After the pain subsided I got on the eliptical machine and I did 1.32 miles of that in 20 minutes.       Wow... it's really pouring out there. I always liked the rain though. Especially the kind when it's not too cold out and it's down pouring. I loved getting caught in the rain. I remember once... it was on my friend Renata's birthday we were walking from school and it was raining so hard... I had the bright idea to go and walk to her sister Sabrina's school and pick her up. Renata agreed and we walked in the DRENCHING rain and when we noticed that her sister wasn't gonna come out we decided to just go back to her house. There we saw Sabrina in the kitchen eating cereal. I think Renata was ready to kill me then. But it was all good because it was fun none-the-less.       I went to the bowling alley today to return a job application. I really want to get this job. I like the environment and the lady that I talked to was really nice. I wish I had gotten her name but I didn't. I'm gonna see if I can call again tomorrow and ask about the job position. My brother and Julie brought me there before we went to the gym.       Well... that's all for now.
