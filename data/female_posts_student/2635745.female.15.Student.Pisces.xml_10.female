At the forensic meeting this afternoon, I got my gold sticker for degree of honor there were 8 of us so we posed the Can-Can.  Then at practice rob had me read the first paragraph of my neg to check speaking skills.  He told Chris he was boring and then people critiqued me.  Lindsay, Sara, becca, and Chris liked my SKILLS, but autumn said I was too forceful and flowery.  Then rob said and this is a direct quote, "that some judges might not like it and, as they did to autumn once, write 'Caitlin you're being a bitch'."  But then rob said when I was a debater I was known for my speaking skills and I spoke like you and when you spoke it was pleasant and I wanted to listen.  I felt special.  Then he had Michael try.  And as you all may know you cant look at Michael without laughing.  So he can't even speak because everyone even rob just cracked up when Michael started to speak.  Oh god.  This was a good day and also they have Ted turner at Gatlinburg so Sara and Lindsay might do that and that opens up some spots in LD so I probably will get to triple.  YEAH!
