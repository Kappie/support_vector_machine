I miss all our lame times that we've had this summer like harry potter, halo, joeys, all trying to fit in the bed at once, and camping. even just sitting and watching nip/tuck. I dont want him to leave. but I am sure he will have fun and its not like he isnt coming back. He better email me lots though!!! haha...   Britt's back!!! YAY!!! she called me today and we talked each other's ears off for like an hour and then we all got together and hung out at mandys for a little while. It is nice to have her back. So she will get her work schedule and then we will plan our days of fun. including six flags and canoeing.   My dad called last night and we decided that we would tell Veronica we are coming but we just dont know when. So I mean we are sailing until like 8 or 9 but we will drive down there and be with them late... it will be fun!! I am excited... and Chadd will probably be bummed because amanda wont be coming and he's got a thing for her. haha we even have a pic where he is checking her out. haha...    Um... well I am going over to Britt's house to watch Nip/Tuck tonight; amanda, maybe max, britt, james, and myself; it should be a good time. I just hope they all realize that it is quiet time!! well I'm going now...   adios   -gabby
