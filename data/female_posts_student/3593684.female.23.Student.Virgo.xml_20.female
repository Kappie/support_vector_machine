Thursday Night -- Too much to drink at  urlLink The Standard sets the stage for a comical taxi ride friday morning.  Friday Monday-- taxi driver reluctant to drop me off in the middle of arlington heights says, "This is not a neighboor for blond girls."  Friday Evening-- Las Vegas! What happens in vegas is supposed to stay there, but fuck it! I've been breaking all the other rules, so why not this one too.  Saturday Evening -- Magnetic Fields unplugged, fans stupid as ever.  Saturday Evening, continued -- Lies and more Lies. Ditched my date early on to make another one. Unfortunately they both work at my office. I'm really pushing the envelope here.  Sunday Morning -- Suntan lotion and sand. I love venice beach. Must relocate as soon as possible.  Monday Morning -- Surprisingly chipper considering the overwhelming amount of alcohol I consumed this weekend and the insufficient amount of sleep.   Tonight: Modest Mouse concert. will post more tomorrow. Back to work.  P.S. I haven't a clue who Tony is, or why he is using the name "sev." Tony, you out there? Can you explain?
