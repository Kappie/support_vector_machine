I check my email, thinking it'll just contain the usual stuff, not worth much reading. And then I get this message from none other:  "'I'd rather be myself,' he said. 'Myself and nasty. Not somebody else, however jolly.'" -Brave New World  if you don't like it, tough  Here I smile. Am I supposed to analyze this? I am tempted to write back, Oh, but you are nasty. And end it at that.   Well, I'm in the mood for overanalysis. Humor me. Or don't read it, I don't mind. Really.  So I tell him he's cold and heartless, a la Meursault. I tell him Meursault is going to be executed. I think this is what he copy-pasted back to me, from Jane Eyre:  Jane feels the need to belong somewhere, to find “kin,” or at least “kindred spirits.” This desire tempers her equally intense need for autonomy and freedom.  Actually, thinking about it, that's not too far from the truth. I congratulate him, that was an accurate quote.  Ah, so what do I do now? I could capitulate, and tell him that I was joking and I took it too far, but Meursault really did remind me of him. I could not talk to him ever again. Or I could send something caustic back in his direction. Oh, what a dorky little argument this is. Based on literature, of all things.  What a way to spend a Monday afternoon.
