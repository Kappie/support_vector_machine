Three new pairs of pants from Downeast Outfitters and new yoga garb from TJ Maxx.  Sweeet.  Even have our eyes on some hot suits at Dillard's.  They just might be on sale in Salt Lake...you never know!    Mom's lightening up more, which is so nice.  It's easier to say 'no' to a bad outfit and we laugh a lot.  Even got her caught up on the Viscous situation this morning and it didn't end in tears.  She managed to get the words 'gay' and 'lesbian' out without choking.  "You should just find yourself a nice young man and settle down," she said with a laugh.  "I know.  Levi and I should just stop the charade."  "Really!!"  "Eww, gross."  "Really?"  "Really.  If I can't get excited about Levi, there's no hope."  "Hmmm."  The Viscous conversation didn't last much longer beyond the bare facts, but she did give me a hug after she'd escaped to her bathroom to get ready.  I'm not sure it helped paint a reassuring picture of the lesbian community, but at least it was the truth.  I'd been having a hard time trying to bring up the topic because there was so little to tell, but the last Mom heard, things were just getting rolling and I knew she was wondering about it.  Truth be told, I'd been thinking about V more than I should have been the last few days.  Not wistfully or "Well, maybe...", but I thought it might be nice to see her again when I managed to make my way to Bozeman before heading back to Moscow.    I should have known better.  And thankfully, the Boy helped me see the way before I made a mistake.  There's no big story to tell, just more of what I already knew about her tendency to hear whatever she wants (regardless of whatever is actually said) and turn it into a bigger, more dramatic, more harrowing saga.  I wasn't surprised to hear the spin she put on our story, but was disappointed and more hurt than I realized at the time.  But it got me to delete her numbers from my cell phone and put any ideas of friendly coffee out of my mind.  I know it has nothing to do with me, but it still confuses me that something has to be twisted into an ego-stroking soap opera to be worthy of telling friends.  Sigh.  Oh well.  I'm having too good a time doing nothing to think about it much.    And I don't really know what drove me to tell Mom about it.  But after all the times of listening about Joe's woes in love and roommates, it seemed about time for my turn.    "You need someone more mature," she said after telling me what a wacko V is, in a vaguely comforting, supportive, motherly way.  "It's true, I do."  You have no idea, Mom.
