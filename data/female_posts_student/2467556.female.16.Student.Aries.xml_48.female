Here is a critique of each of the stories:  "Sunny Days and Sunny Nights" alright first of all, this story had no flow.  the author was constantly going from past to present to future....AAAAHHH STAY IN ONE TENSE!!!!!  She's all like "i went on this date with Alan and then i went on a date with John but thennnnn i realized how much i want Sunny but my dad is all like.....".  ok....what?  If Sunny asked you to marry him and then he goes into the Navy for a little while.....and then you date other guys while he's gone?!?!?!?!  Isn't that considered adultery in an indirect way!?!?!  Did Sunny know about these little rendez-vous?  This story really did have potential but then it just got crappy.  Was the fried chicken symbolic? I could kinda relate to the author's story, but not really.  Plus, the Sunny guy was really REALLY corny.  No offense, but what guy is just like "Hey lets name our kids!"....none that i know of in contemporary american society.....not even really in the entire world.  I dunno about you guys, but a surfer dude does not sound appealing to marry.....even if he's been in the navy and especially if his name is HAROLD.  I liked the blonde hair part but not the surfer and always tanned part or the california part.  I think that Alan guy had the right idea with "pale is in" because i'm pale, i've never been tanned and i'll never be tanned.....so this is why i go for pale blonde people who like the cold......and this is where the hockey-ness comes in because its cold.....surfing is ok but its not my fave thing in then entire freaking world.  yeah ok i'm going on a tangent here, next critique  "Newcomers to a Uncertain World"  Ok, the title had nothing to do with the freaking story and the entire story was just a bunch of random little paragraphs.  it starts out with this girl talking about how her 4-year old son realizes while he's drawing his own name that the letters of his mother's name are also located inside his name. Does anyone else find it weird that this lady's son calls his mother by her first name and not by like....i dunno...."MOM"!?!?!?  Then she goes on to talk about how she hated her name for the longest time until she was sitting in her best friend's sister's car and she looks at some neon green sign and is like "hey actually, my name rocks".  Then she goes to this restaurant in San Antonio meets this guy who she decides is her future husband and just so happens that her friend that she's with knows this guy and introduces them.  Then she starts rhyming things with this guy's last name, Nye.  then she goes off on a tangent about how all the Nye's in America get together and talk.  Now honestly, what people do that if they don't know each other.   Then she's like "hey lets have a dinner party in which all the Nyes in San Antonio come over and we'll hang out and become the best of friends".  Yeah so then all these Nyes and people that she DOESN'T KNOW and for all she knows could be STALKERS or AXE MURDERERS come over for dinner.  The end.  I dunno about y'all but if i got some random invitation from some lady that i don't know, i'd be just a tad bit frightened as to how she acquired my address and name.  Ugh that story had no point and the worst diction and grammar i've ever seen!  TOO MANY COMMAS!!!!!!!!!!  Ok and i am done now. Thank god the English TAKS is over.  I don't know if i could've taken another pointless story with no flow again.  Nothing really happened today because i was in TAKS.  Me, Brittany and Jessica went to Quizno's and talked about relationships and first kisses.  It turns out i have had my first kiss, i just didn't count it on accident! yay! next on the agenda is to get a boyfriend and from the looks of things, its not going to happen very soon.  Anyways, Jessica was counting how many people she's made out with and she kept on getting mad because she couldn't remember one of her 7.  I was like shutup, i've got zero on my list and then i quoted our fave show by saying "go me, i'm an impregnable fortress" (don't ask) and then Brittany shouts "haha! I'M FULL OF SPERM!!!!" (she was also quoting our fave show).....the guy who was working at Quizno's was sooooo confused.  It was soooo funny.  Then we went to Starbucks to "study" in which we just talked to these other people most of the time.  I had a near death experience by choking on my coke because jess or britty or something made me laugh.  I couldn't breathe i swear and i had everyone in the Starbucks watching me to see if i'd die or not.  Then every 5 secs after that, Jess would ask me if i was dying.  It was very scary.    Hmm i think i'll procrastinate studying just a little longer.....  Best of Luck on exams!!!, ~~~Taylor~~~
