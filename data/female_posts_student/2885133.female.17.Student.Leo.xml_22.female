Reasons why I dislike milk:   I am partially lactose intolerant -- limited consumption of ice cream and highly regulated consumption of whipped cream (whose absence makes Italian Sodas not that interesting)  Growth hormones for milk cows also in milk as well and my thryroid goes biserk. Swollen throat is  not  fun at all. It makes me choke really easily   Sniffles... now I am pretty much on a soy diet. Not that soy is bad, but I still have this little wish of getting at least one inch taller. I mean, 5 feet 5.5 inches is somewhat average. And of course, I can't stand having also those fives. It's spiteful... darn AP exams.
