Considering asian blood runs through  all  of my viens, this ain't good. Canada.. what have you done to me!!!! but then again, asians do  cook the fake-chinese food. so I guess I'm good. their rice sucks though.   I wonder if the chinese food in the States tastes like the ones in Canada hmmm...   okay breakfast time. all this food talk is making me  hungry
