I had always maintained that he was innocent before. But now read this... this makes me feel better. This case isn't so unsimilar to that of the '93 case.   Fox News: Roger Friedman from Fox News has exposed the real truth behind the latest in malicous allegations against Michael Jackson: "Forget all these stories that Mark Geragos was hired to represent Michael Jackson just yesterday. Or the day before. Were we all born yesterday? Geragos has been on the case since last March. That's right. Jackson has known for most of the year, even if he didn't want to acknowledge it, that trouble was brewing at Neverland. The child who is now the subject of this molestation allegation began to raise questions about their relationship late last winter. Jackson -- who is not completely out of touch with reality -- responded by bringing in an expert defender. Jackson's camp, I am told, is more than ready to do battle with his accuser and his family. I am told that the mother of the child involved will be held up to severe scrutiny. In fact, Jackson's side will likely argue that when he tried to break off his involvement with helping the boy and his family financially, the mother became, and I am quoting a Jackson insider, "a scorned woman." "She's very screwed up," said one source. "There's videotape of her acting weird, too. And Michael was very kind to her, even getting an apartment for her boyfriend." But the argument will be that when this woman, who is financially so dependent that she claimed to have lived in a barn, was told by Jackson's people that the party was over, she ran to a lawyer to see what she could get out of it. Remember, everyone in this country is guaranteed a defense, even if you don't agree with it. But as I wrote in this space yesterday, a lot of the evidence in the Jackson case will come down to videotape. There is lots of it, too, some of which may show the boy and his family singing the praises of Jackson, defending and explaining his odd lifestyle. If so, they will be hard-pressed to explain their own behavior now. For example: In one interview last winter, the mother of the boy told a reporter: "Michael has pet names for all of my children, and [one of them] even calls him Daddy. He is the father they never had." She said all her children were "hoping to spend a lot more time with him in the future." ______________________  Here's another one... ____________________  "Santa Barbara, California, District Attorney Tom Sneddon's cheerful smile at Wednesday's press conference announcing the latest child-molestation accusations against Michael Jackson said it all. This case is personal. With 33 years of experience as a district attorney behind him, Sneddon is certainly a professional, but he showed unusual satisfaction in issuing an arrest warrant for the pop star.  The apparent vendetta most likely stems from two events. Sneddon was the prosecutor on the child-molestation case against Jackson 10 years ago, only to find himself without a victim willing to testify when Jackson reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the alleged victim's family (that case led California to change its laws so that child-molestation victims could be compelled to testify.) Secondly, Jackson later attacked the DA in his music.  Jackson's 1995 double album, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book 1, includes a song called "D.S." featuring the chorus, "Dom Sheldon is a cold man," according to official lyrics. His pronunciation of the title character, however, sounds much closer to "Tom Sneddon is a cold man." In the opening verse, Jackson sings, "They wanna get my ass/ Dead or alive/ You know he really tried to take me/ Down by surprise." Other verses includes the lyrics, "He out shock in every single way/ He'll stop at nothing to get his political way," and "You think he brother with the KKK?/ I know his mother never taught him right anyway/ He want your vote just to remain DA."  Sneddon addressed the song earlier this year in an interview with the National District Attorney's Association (NDAA). "I have not — shall we say — done him the honor of listening to it," he said.  Prior to releasing "D.S.," Jackson indirectly expressed his frustrations with Sneddon in a television announcement, noting the excruciating experience of being stripped naked and photographed during the 1993 investigation.  Before the accuser halted the investigation by declining to testify in court, Sneddon said the photographs were necessary to verify the boy's description of intimate parts of Jackson's anatomy.  The DA, a father of nine, is known for his take-no-prisoners courtroom demeanor, which earned him the nickname "Mad Dog" early in his career, according to the NDAA.  Sneddon served in the Vietnam War and worked at the Los Angeles district attorney's office, but has been with Santa Barbara County since 1969. He was elected district attorney in 1982 and has been re-elected ever since, prompting the local newspaper to call him "arguably the single most powerful person in all of Santa Barbara County."  Aside from handling Jackson in 1993, the former Notre Dame boxer is most famous for a case that almost stalled when Israel refused to extradite two hit men accused of murdering a Santa Barbara couple. Sneddon eventually traveled to Israel and assisted prosecutors in convicting the men and then turned around and had Canada extradite the man who had hired the hit men and convicted him.  On Wednesday, Sneddon maintained a grin for most of the press conference and even made some jokes, such as when asked if the timing of the charges was connected to Tuesday's release of Jackson's Number Ones hits album. "Like the sheriff and I are really into that kind of music," Sneddon said."  This report is from MTV News.  __________________   ************ Everyone feel more enlightened now? Made me feel a tad better. I know it's hard to understand someone like Michael, but I like to think that I kind of do... and I think he's innocent. Call him weird or crazy but he is not a child molestor. He friggin thinks HE's a child, for God's sake. He may have some strange illusions and he may be messed up but he is still a sweet kind person. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it. You wouldn't understand i guess... don't  urlLink judge  a  urlLink book  by it's  urlLink cover  .
