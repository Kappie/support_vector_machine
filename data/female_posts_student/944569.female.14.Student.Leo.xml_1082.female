I put it up in tiles since i loved it so much.  it completely booted off my Chobits wallpaper with Chii in a little angel costume, pulling away some curtains.  It is also my background for my msn convos.  Very cute, it blends nicely with the conversation window.  No other picture has been more perfect.  No worries, i'm sure i'll find another image that shall pique my interest and boot off this Sasuke x Sakura picture. XD
