As soon as I finish that challenge project (grr) and make up that challenge ap essay (grr some more), the rest of the tri is downhill for me...now just a matter of finishing those two things. Today was a fairly good day...started off with challenge and we watched a movie. Calculus was calculus I guess, not too bad just went over another section. Lunch was fun like always....Chemistry...ugh I HATE that class, cuz the teacher can't teach, we have to learn everything on our own, makes me mad. Then lab management, man thats an easy blowoff class...Oh yea, can't forget that detention in lab management today. Whats that you say? How can I possibly get a detention in lab managemet? I'll tell ya....so we had this sub on thursday and friday, and apparently right from the start he didn't like me. They were taking the test, and he told me to get ready for it and I said I was just the lab assistant, so he goes "So why aren't YOU handing out these papers?"...as if I'm suppose to psychically know to do HIS job...so I think I *might* have given him a weird look on accident....but I still handed out the stuff nonetheless because its not like I'm going to say no......thanks mr sub. Then, on Friday, I asked if I could go to Calculus for some "calculus tutoring"....ok so what if I was really going to go play chess with the other multivariable calculus people, I still said calculus tutoring :) He said yea thats fine, so with about 20 mins left in class I came back, walked around the room a little bit, then saw a table playing cards, so I joined in for the rest of the period. Monday, I come back, first thing I hear from Murphy (physics teacher) is that I got a detention for the following: refusing to help the sub, skipping half of class, then playing cards when I got back. And Murphy showed me the note and thats EXACTLY what it said....what the crap. Yea so that sucked. Oh anyways back to my day (yea I'm almost done). So afterwards Mooney, Melissa and I all go to starbucks...they go for tutoring, I just kinda chatted once in a while but I tried to sleep most the time :) Afterwards, we just drove around a bit, then went home and I ate dinner and did some stuff then here I am typing this huge blog! Speaking of huge blog, this is tiring my hands, I think I'm gonna stop now....if anyone is still reading this far lol.  Until our paths next cross...   Habibi  [/end paste]
