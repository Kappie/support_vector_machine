It was a mistake, but I'm SINGLE, as much as I hate that, but I'm making my own decisions now.  Kevin  got really pissed off, and I don't blame  him , i'd never talk to me again if I was in his position, but still, he told me to make other plans so I did. and now  he  expects me to tell  him  something and i'm so confused b/c I know  he  thinks I'm going to tell  him  and i dont know what  hes  talking about. Oh wait, I'm talking to  him  on AIM, and  he  thinks I did something with another guy at IU. OMG  thats  what  he  was worried about??  That boy  is crazy. At IUi met tons of awsome people but... OMG i cant believe thats what  he  was really worried about!! I love  him , but  hes  crazy
