Same instructor as step, and now that she knows me, yeah she pushes me just that much more, but that is good especially for my lazy ass.  I swear, another couple weeks of this plus step and yoga each twice a week and I'll be looking even better, maybe another ten pounds will drop, yeah!  I swear I have a six pack, it's just hiding right now, waiting to emerge.  Awesome workout, although I'm going to feel this the next few days.  The first offical day of school went awesome.  I know not every day is going to be this easy, but I'm even more excited now to get going on this.  Again, still have concerns about classroom management, but it'll all work out.  My CT is planning to turn the reins over in two weeks, yikes!  I'll be teaching for about 8 total, wow, me teaching young minds, look out.  It really is a nice school so far, all the faculty and students, all very nice so far.  Alright, school beckons in the AM, must take my sore body to sleep, night!
