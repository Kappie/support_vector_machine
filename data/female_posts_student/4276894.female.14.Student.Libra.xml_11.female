Some unimportant (for you, but very important for me) facts: I play the guitar, sing and used to play keyboard. My favourite type of music is metal, which i have come to find a hell of a lot of people don't like.  Which is a shame, because it has some of the best guitars, drummers and *cough* vocalists you are likely to find in the current music business (not that the so-called underground bands like to count themselves as in it). Something that pisses me off about this is the fact I can NEVER find a CD by an "unknown" band I like in the CD shops.  One example of this would be Razor, a great thrash band from the 80's which just seems, if you go by these shops' stocks, to have never existed.  I suppose this would make sense, as most people don't like it and the shops have to buy because of demand, but I reckon that even if they just stocked a couple of copies of their CDs this would be enough.  They are cutting out a huge portion of music which just isn't right and it doesn't help the consumer.  Anyway, enough about that. If anyone has any thoughts on that, or anything else, or if ya just wanna tell me how great metal is :P, don't hesitate to post!
