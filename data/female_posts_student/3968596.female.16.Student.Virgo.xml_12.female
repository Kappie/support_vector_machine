She informed me (and my mom) that stress can be caused by a wide range of troubles---academics, parents arguing, etc. Ha! I knew it! My family does give me stress. But I still want to keep my hair!! So, I'm suppose to use my mom's special shampoo b/c it's ph balanced w/ other good hair-care qualities. I always thought losing a little hair was normal (avg person loses 40 strands a day) but I guess in my case it's not a little but enough to start thinning my hair! WHY ME??!! Well, my session went nicely after that lil shocker. I had it cut to long layers so it's still mid-back. I luv that length! When I was little, I had long, straight hair but an unfortunate hair cut accident w/ my dad in the 3rd grade left me w/ hair chopped right below my ears!  Anywayz, Rozban styled my hair quite nicely afterwards (I was going to take my senior pics later). Shiny and sleek with bouncy curls at the ends. Best haircut ever! Made me forget about the whole "hair " thing. Besides if I use that shampoo, my hair should stop doing  that  and return to a healthy state in 3 weeks. She's also giving me a deal on this hair serum from Avaeda that keeps hair shiny and soft. It really does pay to have connections w/ a hair stylist. ^_^
