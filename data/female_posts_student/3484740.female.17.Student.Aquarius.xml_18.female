I think the person I told thought I meant Peaches, but I meant his collar. I have not seen Peaches since the last time he was here with me, which I am very happy about. It would be a lot harder on me if I was to see him any other way. :(  Everything else is going pretty good. School starts Wednesday! I'm excited...but then I'm not. Its going to be over before it starts, but it'll be okay. I have some pretty cool classes I think, one is Stagecraft. And we get to be in charge of the Drama Homecoming float, and other stuff for plays and stuff. We don't have a lot of money, so its a pretty good class to take your senior year, because you probably won't do much. Which is also very cool.  As far as me and Kerry, we're good. It finally sank in the other day that he has no where else to go but here. Now that his mom has left and everything, this is his home. Hes okay with it I think. But it probably gets to him sometimes, I think it would anyone. We kind of got into it tonight, he has been saving change for like 2 years and has a little over 200 dollars, and lately I've put in some as well, no more than 25 dollars I'd say, but I still put something in. And about a week and a half ago we decided to save 1 dollar bills, and I know I've put in at least half of that, and we have about 70 I believe...and tonight we were at Sonic and he asked for my ones and I said sure and gave them to him, and I don't even remember what was said, but he said that I didn't put any in, maybe 5 dollars but the rest was his. Well I didn't like that because its not true, I know I've put in like half. Because for the last week and a half he really hasn't had any money. Thats why when he says he wants me to put his money in my bank account, I won't. I do not want any confusion as to what is mine. I don't want to be selfish, but I don't want something like tonight to happen, with a greater amount. So I'm going to eliminate that possibility at all. Anyway, so we kind of got into it, and he wouldn't even see where it made me mad. But oh well. It'll pass.  Mom and dad are pretty crazy right now, we're running low and its getting very stressful. I went to the dentist not to long ago and they gave me 20 pain pills. Well, I've had 3, dad has had 3, and Kerry had 1, and I have one left. And mom swears that she isn't taking them. I know she has. Thats 12 pills gone...and shes the only one left. She was very defensive when I asked her about it last night, and I talked to dad about it this morning, and he said that it wasn't a subject he wanted to bring up to her because she would deny it. But for almost as long as he has known her, she has liked her pain pills. I don't understand what for though. Nothing major has happened to her for her to be in so much pain or whatever. Dad, yes...but nothing has happened to her. I needed them the day of and the day after my dentist appointment. But thats a good reason...she has none. I don't understand why she lies about it though, it doesn't make sense. Dad told me to leave it alone, so I guess I will. It still pisses me off though.  Anyway, thats about all for now. Its been a while since I've written, and I'm sure it will be a while before I write again. So...Until next time!
