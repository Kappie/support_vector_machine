I love Ashton with all my heart! I love him has if he was my own child but damn it this isn't fair! I actually could of gone some where this weekend but I didn't -- I stayed home to help babysit because I knew mom didn't have it in her to run after a 1 year old for 2 days.      Instead of saying anything - I just sit back and feel completely left out and lonely has usual. It's not fair! Ugh!      We were suppose to celebrate Christmas this weekend too but because it was to much out of there schedule that was canceled too.       What totally fucking pisses me off too -- Is the fact Brian can fix his girlfriend's MOM's car and yet when I had mine... he was to busy to fix it. He always gave me a million reasons why he couldn't but the fact is he just didn't want too. Then I was completely stupid and sold him my car to help him out!      Oh well...
