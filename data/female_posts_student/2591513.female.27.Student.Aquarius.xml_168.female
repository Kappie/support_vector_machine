It is hard on a single income...especially when the pay isn't that great...but we make ends meet.  I hope to get a job after everything settles down with school.  I actually cooked today.  It wasn't anything great, just sinigang and adobo ribs.  I figured to have some kind of variety especially since the sisters are going to be coming home tonight.  Last night we went to see a concert....it was Dolphy and his wife Zsa-Zsa.  (Filipino comedian and singer)  Anyway, I didn't think I would enjoy it, but I did.  It was fun.  Dolphy still got it, even though he is like 75 years old...I haven't laughed that much in a long time.  But let me complain for a little bit.  Okay tell me why these people were dressed for a ball...not all mind you, but most.  Hello, concert in the middle of the ghetto does not require gowns.  LOL  I am sorry, just ridiculous to me.  Oh and then let me complain about the frickin' heat in the place.  Oh it was awful, no kind of air conditioning...it was so damn hot in there.  I did like Zsa-Zsa's voice.  The girl has lost a lot of weight, she is beautiful.  I wasn't diggin' her opening outfit...too hoochified for her age.  That's just my opinion though...I could be wrong...but the lady can sing.  Okay, I think that is it...well until maybe later tonight or maybe tomorrow morning.  Hope you all had a good weekend.  I know I did.
