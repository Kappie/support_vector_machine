Quite possibly one of the most ingenuitive designs ever: you call a preset number and it asks you a few questions, and after this, a little beep and some recording time, and your voice is BLog-bound.   The transcript of the above-call:  Hello antiphilanthrophists, this is Josh, I was just, uh, trying out the cool little doohickey because it's free and...hey, whatever and...ha hum...don't really know what to say, but this is me to all the people that don't know me and all the people that do: stay cool. Bye bye everybody.    Ok, now off to the present. A shaking day ended in a fine-enough manner. As I had expected, I was quite smacked about the face by Brittany for being a "fucking idiot", and I agreed with her every propulsion of hand and muscle. Overall, however, the bus ride was much more enlightening than the past few weeks of cloudy commune, and seeing the sun and smelling a semblace of spring was uplifting to me. I felt as if I lost another shroud of impertinence while waiting  on that ride.  Hope Brittany has something to tell me tomorrow.
