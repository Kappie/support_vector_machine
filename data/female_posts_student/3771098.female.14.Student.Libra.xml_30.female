Well, we're staying in Augustana College tonight in Sioux Falls, SD. We have dorms and stuff, it's pretty cool, except for the fact that no guys can come on our floor and no girls can come on the guys floor. Oh well, we'll live. The 2 guys checking us in we're most definately gay. Me and Amez are rooming togheter. It's cool. But what's not cool is having to take a crap in a restroom that's not your own. I guess I'll have to get used to it though, because i'm gonna' be gone for a while.   We're all getting up early tomorrow to look cute and stuff (aka, take showers, blow dry and curl hair, put on makeup and cute clothes) because we're going to the Bad Lands (it's like a canyon kinda' thing, i think...) and we're going to Wall Drug (some kinda' town that has been on every billboard for the last 6 hours). Well that's about it. Night kids.  Liz
