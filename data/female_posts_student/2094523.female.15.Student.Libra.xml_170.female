Drowning out your thoughts I hear But it is too late I’ve heard them all The sound has come and disappeared But rings through tears are these silent calls. Hating all those that thrive in this place How they survive as I fail miserably.  Secretly we’re all a creations of disgrace Your arrogance does not impress me Touches of your fingers upon my skin Only spell hatred as I’m tranquilized Numb with fear smiles wearing thin Close to death I realize Last touch of your pen last stroke of ink Final inch of paper for you to write This nightmare left for us to think.  What is left for me tonight?
