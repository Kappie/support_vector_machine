Ironically his name is Nick.  He's really nice, and especially cute... :-)  I'm not saying that anything in a dating relationship way will happen, because for all I know he's dating someone and just flirts alot.  However, he seems really cool, and at the very least I will have made a new work/UTSA friend.  :D  So... anyhow, training is going.  Today's sessions were extremely long... thankfully we had some group time which helped to break up the monotony of the lecturing.  Anyhow, I'm looking forward to tomorrow's sessions... because I know they'll be fun!  :-)  Okay, it's off to Jennifer's (and then Ricky's) I go... we're going to watch another Nightmare movie... gotta get them done so we'll be ready for the Freddy Vs. Jason premiere!  :-D  LATER GATOR!
