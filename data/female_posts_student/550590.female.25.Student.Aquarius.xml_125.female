Maybe now I'll have to update it or something.  Thanks to Shawn for hosting a superbowl party with lots of good food...yummy.  Thanks for all the birthday wishes.  I swear I'll get around to answering my email at some point this week.    I finished all of my stuff for UCF on Friday, so now it's wait-and-see time.  Hopefully they'll not only accept me, but will give me advanced standing and lots of money to go with it...Woo!  We'll see.  Hope you're all well.  Write if you get a chance.  Mwah!  The old lady, Dannie
