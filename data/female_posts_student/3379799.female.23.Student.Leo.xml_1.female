Although they were trying to be mean to me, I was able to take that quote and make it a helpful philosophy for myself and a few of my friends.  We all have a less than shining moment in our lives.  Mines came in the form of a drugdealing, check fraud guy who had a baby face and a pretty smile.  This guy was in no way, shape, or fashion good enough for me, but my need to be needed overtook my sensibility.  Plus, this guy thought I was the stuff, who doesn't want to be desired.  I played hard to get for a while, then I fell headfirst into a world of sh_t.  After introducing this clown to my entire family(two weeks after we met, much too soon!!), he stopped calling.  He didn't answer my phone calls or even try to contact me.    So you know what happened next; I called from another number to see  if he was just avoiding my phone calls.  Of course he answered, but quickly found an excuse to get of the phone.  Time for the next step, hounding his friends.  I called his friends and repeatedly tried to inquire as to what I HAD DONE, as if I could apoligize and make things come back together.  After many sudden cases of amnesia, I took the final step.  I left a message crying about my need to talk.  I wanted sympathy, I got a blocked number.  The final straw came from an argument with a mutual friend.  Although I was long over this fool, this psedo-friend said something I already knew, just needed to hear again.  That quote will forever stick in my head.  For one reason, it reminds me that some people are just not cool and will say things just to hurt your feelings.  Mostly, beacause it made me look for things in mates I should require for someone to have to even get a chance to know me.  If the person doesn't recognize your worth in the beginning, you'll depreciate in value and eventually be worth nothing to the next person, and trust me, there is always a next.  So remember, "That n_gger don't want you!!"  You really should and could DO BETTER!!
