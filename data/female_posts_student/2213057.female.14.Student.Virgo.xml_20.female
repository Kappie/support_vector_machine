WES SAID I COULD HAVE HIS GUINEA PIG. yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hope i'm allowed. i came home, did my homework and went to bed at a ridiculously late hour. i woke up late this morning. i rushed to the bus, caught it. i saw the cutest thing. this guy i had always thought was mean moved his knapsack from the seat beside him for an old man and offered the seat to him. it was quite cute. i was touched but pretended i didn't notice because the old man didn't take the seat. today so far has been okay. my pictures are awesome. my muscles hurt from volleyball. oh yes, the list was posted. i was cut, but that's okay. i can wait until next year. and ya, my comuters teacher just ignores me. i'll ask him a question and he pretends he doesn't hear. he totally ignores me. it's funny but also really frustrating. until a later time, good day.
