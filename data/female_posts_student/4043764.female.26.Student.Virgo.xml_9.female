The interview is for a consultancy in Afghanistan; I would work with staff there to better mainstream gender into their relief programs.   I am fretting a bit about the assignment because I start school mid- to late-September. Plus, I am still in Georgia and would have to move up to Massachusetts before going out to Afghanistan. And... most of my stuff is in boy's house. Dunh dunh dunh... Here I go again, jumping the gun. Who's to say that I would even get the position?
