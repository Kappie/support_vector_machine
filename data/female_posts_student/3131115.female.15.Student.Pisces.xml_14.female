This one, I dont know if I am going to accomplish though. I dont really know if I will ever be fully satisfied with my Blog. Errr...If I ever am, it will be a miracle. I can't quite say that I'm a perfectionist...but writing a letter or something and messing up makes me angry. Therefore, usually...if the time is given I write a new one. I have a habit of messing up with pencil, and scribbling it...forgetting that I have an eraser only on the other side of the pencil lead. Big habit...how do I break it? Could I...purposely write with pencil and erase it lots of times, over and over? Would it work..or next time I messed up would I still scribble, not thinking about it ahead of time....? Hmmm. Should I try? Naww....Forget that. That's a waste of time.   It's times like these where I question anything. Anything there is out there..and it makes me happy. Although, Asking myself if I had a choice between two things makes me feel in control. God never gives us a second chance. Well, if he does it's called a Miracle, and obviously if it's called a "miracle" then it doesnt happen often. Although, in stories..you hear Satan giving you things and in exchange you sell him your soul. Atleast the devil gives you something in return for it. heh...even though I believe in niether thing..it's still something to think about. If there were a god..and a devil,  which would I worship? Well, according to all the shit they say in church.. "god forgives" so one person could worship/follow satan their whole life and when they turn 80 ask for forgiveness. Why anyone would do such a stupid thing I dont know, just something else to think about. I'm boring myself now..Although speaking of God and the Devil...my ex boyfriend once got mad at me for not believing in God. His response after making fun of it was...  "So you worship the devil?"  I was dying of laughter..(on the inside of coarse). But I was so filled with anger for him having such stupidity that I couldnt laugh to him. Instead I called him an idiot,  and explained to him WHY I can't believe in the devil if I dont believe in God.  You know, some...and most people who are religious think they know their shit, yet them knowing their shit doesn't stop them from asking stupid questions, for example the one my ex boyfriend did. Grr...I dont know anything about the bible, or religion...but I DO KNOW HOW THE DEVIL GOT INTO HELL...and this earth 'wasnt made by the devil' I know that much. Stupid people...grrr. Poo on them. Especially Justin. My oops..:-X, I didnt just say his name. ;-)  Anyhow, I'm going to leave now. I'm getting myself worked up about religion..BAD idea. Forget about it...grr..Laura! Forget about it! It's evil...discriminating..!! EVIL! LIVE!...DIE! EID~ (heh..just thought I'd throw that in, because it didnt make sense)   God is fake...and so are you.
