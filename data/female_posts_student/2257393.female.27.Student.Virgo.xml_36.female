(and what if i get tired all the time and don't feel up to it, like i've been feeling in the past couple of days?  ugh.)  in all truthfulness, it will probably only be like that at first, and then in spurts in smaller conversations, which is okay.  i guess i don't want to lose focus that the reason for the visit is my cousin, and even though he's not getting married anymore, this is/was still a pretty significant time in his life that deserves to be honored.   dr p would tell me if i shouldn't be going to school this fall, right?  she would let me know, she would give me her professional, physician's opinion, right?  because i feel really scared about it, that i'm not going to be able to make it, that i'm going to invest this time and energy and money, which is really borrowed money and what if i don't have the energy for what the experience will demand of me?    but i can't stay at my job now.  i just can't.  i suppose i have some sort of responsibility to myself to move forward with what i want to do.  god, but i'm so scared.  there are so many things that have presented themselves since march, so many unexpecteds and disappointments.  i have no way at all of knowing what is to come.    i read this entire blog about a week ago.  my initial motivation for keeping it was so that i could have a record of what i've been going through and so i could see how far i've come.  i can't say that i've come very far at all.  still the same fears, the same weaknesses, the same doubts.  they may have taken different forms along the way, but i haven't yet grown past them.  physically i don't feel much better, either.  i don't want to die.  i don't want to live in some sort of compromised way, either.  it seems, though, that i have no choice.  i haven't felt uncompromised in three months and what hope do i have or regaining that normalcy?  i should tell dr. p, i guess.  i should tell her more of how i feel.  but i don't want to be some sort of whiny baby patient who complains all the time.  at the same time, i don't like having to sit here with my tiredness and my dizziness if maybe there's something that i can do about it.    i've been trying so hard not to ask this throughout all of this, but right now i'm feeling very much "why me?"  thoughts in the early morning.  still not 5:00 a.m. yet.  i think i'll fill out some student loan forms.  maybe do some research on student health plans.  stean is sleeping upstairs.  i think i probably messed up his sleep, too, with my jerking myself awake every hour or so and being tangled up in the covers.    i wonder where he is with all of this.  i know it's not easy for him.  if the tables were turned, i'm not sure that i could stay with someone with a life-long, possibly debilitating disease.  i don't know that i have the strength to watch that happen.  why does he stay?  why would he want to be with someone who takes things to heart so much and gets so upset and afraid and who turns a headache into a death sentence.  i can be a terrible patient.  i was a terrible patient this weekend with the IV.  i get teary-eyed all the time.  i'm most definitely going through some depression these days.  but still, he's here.    maybe he sees me as his one-way ticket out of philadelphia.  he's needed an opportunity to leave this city for years, and he's found that in me and my law school endeavors.  or maybe he feels committed to me because we have all of these freeloading pets--a dog and two cats that half of the time i'm ready to just let wander out the door and fend for themselves in the world.      the obvious truth is that he's here with me because he loves me.  there's something he sees in me that is more important than disease or disability or anxiety.  holy crap that's a big deal!!!  i mean, where do i put that?  how do i process that in the midst of all the selfishness that i've been feeling lately?  i love him, too, and if this were him and not me, i would undoubtedly stay by his side.  i can't lose sight of how important it is that i have him with me.  i need to get over my stupid illness-obsession so that i can be more mindful of the good things going on right now.  stean is brilliant.  i'm practically the luckiest girl ever.    (is this the balance?  i get to be with someone like him but the trade-off is that i have a stupid disease?)  i can't write anymore right now.  i'm not saying what i'm thinking and i'm not really thinking things that are worth being recorded.    new beastie boys album out today.  i'll sneak out at lunch and pick that up.  and tonight i'll get my laundry done and get packed and tomorrow i leave for NC and a few days' escape.  good things.  there are good things.    i'll go crawl back in bed with stean, just for a minute, while it's still quiet out and before the sun comes up.  i need to put my arms around him and tell him that i love him.  we'll see each other through this, i know it.
