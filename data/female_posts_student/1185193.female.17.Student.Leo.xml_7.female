It was full of tropical drinks (virgins, of course), lazy afternoons at one of the five pools at the MGM Resort, shopping, eating, shows, and walks up and down The Strip.  And I actually got semi-tanned.  WooHoo!  The flight to Las Vegas out of San Jose Mineta was about an hour and twenty minutes.  Not bad.  What shocked me the most is that as soon as we stepped off the plane into the Las Vegas airport, there were slot machines everywhere.  Gambling in Nevada is as common as going to the grocery store in San Jose.  It was a little scary realizing how some people's lives revolve around money.  Las Vegas is a very materialistic city.  And yes, sex sells.  While walking the strip, many non-English speaking minorities try to give you little cards, about the size of baseball cards, that display naked women with numbers to call for 'a good time.'  They do this weird Morse code like sound with the cards.  At different intervals, they flip and flap the cards to echo noises.  I guess it's supposed to get our attention.  If you ever go to Vegas, do not stay at the MGM Grand Resort.  It looks spectacular from the outside, but the rooms are pricey, even though they're average at best.  They don't have a coffee maker, a refrigerator, or a microwave.  At $300 per night, I expected it to be fully equipped with all the standard appliances.  On Sunday night, at the time that I would usually be sitting on the edge of my couch watching Alias, I attended a performance of Mama Mía at Caesar's Palace.  Talk about a great show!  It was fabulous!  The theater was so high-tech; in addition, it had cup holders in the arms of the seats like a movie theater.  Only in Vegas can one drink alcohol while watching a professional show.  It was awesome!  If you ever have the chance to see Mama Mía, do it!  The only question I have is, who decided one day to sit down and write a musical around Abba songs?  I had an overall wonderful experience, although I wouldn't go back again unless we were meeting our friends from Texas there.  It's always fun to go away, but it's always nice to come back home  :)
