We all played LoTR Trivial Pursuit on Saturday night.  The game started at 8pm... and didn't end til a bit after 1am!  It was fun, though... Jana and I both got consumed by the Ring Wraith... so we just sat and watched after that... it was very fun to watch!  You wouldn't think it would be, but it was... then Jana finally went on to bed, and I stayed on because the end of the game was nearing... and I wanted to see someone win.  Dave finally won... he had been winning and trying to finish up the game for about an hour.  Okay, so then Sunday my parents, Uncle Scott, and I went to the Rodeo.  It was pretty good.  It was more eventful than normal because it was the finals.  So, we got to see the best of the best, which was fun.  However, there were some bad moments.  Like the cowboy that got his hand stuck in the strap and was dragged around for about a minute... and you could see him struggling, trying to free himself... finally one of the helpers caught up to the horse and slowed it down so he could free himself.  He didn't have any broken bones, he was just bruised up a bit.  Then during the calf roping (where there's a single rider that ropes the calf's neck and then ties 3 legs together) one of the calves was injured... pretty bad.  When I say pretty bad... I mean... we all pretty much concluded that its neck was broken.  At first we thought it was one of it's legs... but considering the calf roping was the 3rd event out of about 9... and we never heard anything about the injured calf... it's safe to assume that the neck was broken.  Oy... it was depressing.  Anyhow...on a happier note... I got an A on my midi project.  We presented them in class today... and then everyone clapped afterwards (Dr. Sebald had a clap-o-meter to measure the amount of clapping)... and with the claps after mine, I got an A.  Everyone did... :-)  Anyhow... Okay, that's enough for now... more later... :-)
