And I said "like fruit?" He goes "Yea, for some reason Pizza was the first thing that came to mind." Whoa! Pizza...no natural sugar there pal...   Back to my ranting..It's ok because there are plenty of fish in the sea of men......guys......boys. Whatever, you know what I mean. But I need to find someone to save me from myself..lolz. I've been listening to love songs and it kills me...but it's ok. He will come...Like everone tells me, but when he does...I'm going to kick his ass and ask why the hell he took so fuckin' long!!! I think it's also becauseI don't get comfortable with people easily. People make me nervous, especially if I like you. I suppose I could push you away with that...but I've only felt really comfortable with one person...and that obviously wouldn't work because it was wrong to begin with.   Side Note: I loved being totally comfortable with him...it was a great feeling not caring about the way you looked or acted because you knew he accepted you either way, that and he was equally retarded...lolz  anyways, so yea, I get like this sometimes...I think it comes in waves. Sometimes I could really care less and then there are times when I really do want someone. I'm a dork.   Anywhos I got a call back from TJ Maxx and I am set up for an interview on Monday at 3:00. Yay! Wish me luck, loves! I was supposed to go shopping for clothes today, but I didn't and that didn't make me too happy. I need to look good for my interview. ;)   Oh yea! Today I woke up at 7:30 and started working and my uncle came over to help put up the patio cover thing.Sam stayed later as well, He was supposed to go home this morning, but he stayed to help my dad...how sweet. But yea, it was kind of funny because my uncle and Sam were sitting on the top of thepatiothing and they were just chillin' like 12 feet in the air...We had monkeys..glad it was them working instead of me :D   Till later toots!   P.S. I'm not so happy anymore....
