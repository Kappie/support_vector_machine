Well he “got what he wanted and doesn’t care if he ever talks to be again”…WHATEVER man… I’m done Talking about, Thinking about, And liking MIKE……(erg I hate him!) Well tonight is graduation and Eric is supposed to have a little shin-dig and Car said that Nate should go and I said OMG hell yeah b/c he’s a hottie :P AND THEN Tom is all like “you guys should hook up, I was thinking about it yesterday and you guys should just do it” and I’m like umm….duh! And then lunch was over and Car didn’t get a chance to talk to him and I was like oh crap that sucks, and then I saw both Tom and Car talking to Nate in the lobby right after---I like ran out the door so fast so she wouldn’t call me over…I’m suck a pussy but damn he’s so fine  I CANT WAIT TO FIND OUT WHAT HE SAID!!! ---AND---] He actually talked to me today, like pulled me aside and talked to me…yeah it was about getting more pills but still HE talked to ME :) AHHHHH!!!
