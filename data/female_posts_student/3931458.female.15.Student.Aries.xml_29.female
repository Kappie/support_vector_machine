Friday baby elizabeth is gonna spend the day at my house! too bad i'm not gonna b there! I kinda hope kayla's parents r gonna leave friday so thats more kayla jordyn time but i wanna go to my dads work too! ugh decision decidions! I cant believe kayla is gonna leave! it sucks!I'm gonna miss her alot i dont no how i'm gonna get through next year and the year after that. high school stinks. i cant wait to grow up. i was thinking about that after my mom picked my up from kayla's then i thought " i have no clue what i want to do with my life" it is kinda depressing but i have a while till i have to figure it out!!! Tomorrow i hope i can hang out with everybody. by the way everybody is chris,kayla,jared,and sometimes brian and josh. well dont no what else to write   11 Days till Schlitterbahn
