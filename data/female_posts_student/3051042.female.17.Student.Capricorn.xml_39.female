But I liked it, I have to admit. (Oh yeah, my white russian still has ice in it *sip sip* Anyway...) Henk convinced Mom and Dad to let me spend the night (because he's the god of sympathy trips). Paul took Mike and I to go get Malibu and Pucker, we spent about 20 minutes just looking for a liquor store in Flint. Headed to this bon fire, hung out and got drunk off my ass. And as for my expecting there to be hot guys there, I was right. And I was all over them like the whore I planned on being. After the crowd died off, we headed back to the frat house in Henk's van. VAN SURFING IS FUN! And who said you have to be gay to listen to Men at Work? *goes to download "Down Under"* God I love you Nick. Meanwhile, I'm drunk and trying to keep my balance, Nick is chucking condoms from Ohio in my general direction "You'll need these later!!!" and then Henk flies over the hill to the frat house. Everyone exits the car besides Mike, Rick, and myself. I sit there and day dream for a few. Exit. I let the guys examine my car. Smoke a cigarette while Danny puts his arm around me. Watch a frat guy get drenched in ice cold water, take pictures, and laugh. Then he comes after me. Mike grabs me and picks me up, and here come icy-cold wet guy running to give me a hug. My ass gets wet and I laugh some more. We head up stairs and I pass out on Nick's bunk. I lose my camera and lighter in Nick's bed (I wish I could lose myself in Nick's bunk). Henk, two of the guys (one being Stalker Danny), and myself head out to the deck to smoke out. We get sufficiently stoned and head back in to collect ourselves and head to the 8:55pm showing of Hell Boy. Move sucks. I get a nap in. I feel back because my brother paid for my ticket. So I try my best to stay awake. We get back to the house and I drink Red Bull and take caffeine pills. Hang out with everyone for a few. Paul invites me to sleep in his bed instead of the guest quarters. Go out to dinner at the Colonial Coney Island at 2am (but it's daylight savings so it's really 3am) and chat with Stalker-Danny and Oh-My-God-I-Want-To-Fuck-You-Nick. Talk to Rick about my parents. I convince everyone that my parents are assholes. We get back to the house and talk for a bit. I read poetry. I write poetry. I pass out on Nick's recliner. I sleep for two hours and head back at 8am (but it's really 9am due to daylight savings). .Sunday. Well, yesterday was spent working, shopping, and crying. I'm not going into details. I'm sick of everything and ready for things to be over... I was ready 10 days ago. .Monday. Wake up with something that feels like a hang over but is really just a really bad headache. Walk to the bathroom. Realized that I cried myself to sleep and then almost shit myself (yes, Paul, shit myself) when I see how puffy my eyes are. I get to school late. Play shitty on my down-the-line. Talk to Snydee about my Sunday. She sympathizes. I walk to art. I walk to advanced algebra. Kellman bitches at me about my sunglasses. I cry. He caves in and allows the glasses. I finish two quizzes and a section in class. He feels better about things. I feel better about things. I leave school. I hung out with Joce after work. We had the most random day. We got coffee and then I took her to her therapy appointment. I then picked her up an hour later and we came to my house, went through my mom's old jewelry she's getting rid of. We take some of it before it gets trashed, sold, or given away. We then dye our hair. Blonde for Joce. Red roots for me. She drinks her white russian, I'm driving so I put mine in the fridge. I take her home. Come back and now I'm here. Getting an ear-full from my dad about being up so late. I guess that's my cue to leave.  Tomorrow is going to be spent at a party getting drunk with Can-too, his chica-amiga Katlyn, and Joce; over at Jared's apartment. It will be great. I get to stay after school to practice my part with Snydee... oh yay! Not. Alright I'm getting obsessively tired, and really don't want my mom to bitch me out more than my dad has already.   Do you come from the land down under? Do you want to?  Yes Paul.... I miss you... lmao. I miss Nick more... now I just need to figure out how to get him to ditch his girlfriend. Like he'd leave her for me... I need to get real...
