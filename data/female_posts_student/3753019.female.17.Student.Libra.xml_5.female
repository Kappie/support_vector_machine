(genius) so i do, and then i wait for my dad to get home so i can talk to him about getting new handles on my car doors. (the night before someone had gotten into my car. stupid people didnt take anything worth money, they only took the change that was sitting in my passenger seat and my lighter. oh, and they took the two hats i had in there and threw them in the yard across the street from my neighbor. wtf? would someone please tell me what the point of that was?) then i went to my dads baseball game in Groves. i love baseball. fun stuff. so i came home around 11:30, went to walgreens for my mom and came home. then aaron called me around 1 and said to meet him and angela at taco bell, then came to find out it wasnt open. so i waited for him to call me back with a new plan. so i ended up goin to his house for an hour. that was nice. = )  another thing that sucks, that i hardly care about right now because im in such a good mood, but i really do care about overall because it could screw a lot of things up is this school schedule thing. i went to running start monday and found out i lost three of my credits, so when i went back yesterday to find out if i could fix it, the stupid ass. principal is not computer literate so he couldnt access my files, and now i have to wait on attendance to get back on monday to see if i can fix this shit. ughhhhhh. i will cry if this doesnt get corrected.   today i have to make some calls to get my car fixed. aside from that, i dont have anything to do. how lovely. i am going to try to do something with tara so i can gush out all my good feelings to her. i have to do it to someone, or i will burst.
