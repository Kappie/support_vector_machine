Jon(my ex bf) went wacko and told me he wanted me dead and he wanted me to feel pain for the rest of my life..and he just was very morbid with me and it didnt feel good. So i cut him off entirley. I hope i never hear from him again..so would you guys do me a favor and only give my sn and this blog addresss out to your close friends who arent assosiated with jon? Thanks! Um lets see...i still havnt talked to amanda so ive learned to finally get over everything and look at amanda as just a aquantance...and when someone says amanda vanhoose..ill say oh yea..i used to talk to that gurl.
