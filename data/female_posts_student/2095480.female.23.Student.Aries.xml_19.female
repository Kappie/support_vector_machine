Also, got to see  Keith (and Miranda),  always a pleasure. I'm glad that he is surviving student teaching... I wish we could hang out more... but we are both very busy people. Its fun to hang out with  Miranda  at the lab. I wish I had a job where friends could visit me once in a while - albeit  Justin Monday  did come by the office for actual class related stuff... I think he was surprised to see me. A quick hello, and it was back to paperwork for me. Anyway, back to Wed night, after the lab,  Irene, Miranda  and I went on over to  Rick's  to see him and the cat. We drove literally around the block, and then got caught by a really slow train, but thats okay because it gave us something to talk about, and the goal of the evening was to hang out. Then later it was off to Denny's. Hanging out with you guys is so much fun!  Skipping alot of shit, class, homework, work etc... we move to Thrusday night. I got a phone call from a fellow named  Shaun  (Shawn?) who is in my Interdisciplinary Senior Seminar class, and he asked me if I was interested in going out to a movie or something of the like Friday night. HELL YEAH! So, moving on to Friday night... El Toreo and a movie. Overall I had a great time! I think we really clicked. He said he would call tomorrow - I hope for a second date.   Thats it for now. I hope to be writing good news tomorrow night.
