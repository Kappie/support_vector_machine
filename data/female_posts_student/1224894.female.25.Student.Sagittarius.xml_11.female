I was down and out these past few months since life held no meaning at all. Maybe i'm tired with the routine of living, and the heartbreaking events of the past few months led to me decision to hibernate...reest and gather up my strength, for i have been dying each time.  As trivial as this may sound, X-MEN 2 inspired me, not that i am going to admit i'm a mutant, but, at times, i really wanted to  be like Jean Grey...heck! I love Rogue too...(what with Iceman turning out to be a hunk some day), but, a part of me wants to change the world, not the entire world, but i'll start with mine.   After I spent three hours in the house that I had built, though it's just a small resting place, i was overwhelmed with the desire to cry and to shout with glee...i was filled with mixed emotions, because i'm still in awe.  Now, that i have come to the conclusion that i need a moment of hiatus, a part of me wanted to continue living in the shadows, but there's a large part of me that needed to spread my wings and move on.  Maybe this is for the better, maybe not, but i'm counting on my feel-good feeling to lead me the way...I need laughter back in my life, and the drive to live...I need to live again.  Starters...blogging...  Party...mingle with friends....  Work...find time to have fun and love working...  Love...me first.  Future...till then.
