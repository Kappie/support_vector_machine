So it turns out that New Zealand is a heroine whore that likes to take advantage of women. So, of course, I am that much more intrigued. I never claimed sanity, why would I now? I despise such an illusion.   Well, I have homework to do today, and preparation for the dinner. Elise also gave me her blog address, and I'm afraid the reading of the precious manuscript will occupy my blog-writing time for today.  Farewell, dearest reader.
