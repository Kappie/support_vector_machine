How amusing.Yesterday I went to Croydon with Lisa. We shopped ( I brought some skate jeans ) and had pizza hut which was fun. We have a Dutch waiter! Today I worked from 8.30 til 5.30. I have Dean his present, must have been happy with it cos he gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek so that made my made of course. Tomorrow I'm working from 10 til 4.30. Them Monday and Tuseday will most likely be me doing homework as I have many a final piece to do. Wednesday I'm working 1 - 6. Friday I'm working 12.30 - 5.30. Thats good because that is overtime pay so wopee!!  On crimbo day it will be me, Mum, Caz and Dad. That is good because last year we had to post pone xmas for a day as Dad was working so we had our xmas on Boxing day. dad is working on my birthday though which means I'll be spending most of the day worrying because new year eve's party goers who get drunk and stuff can cause an awful amount of trouble and it has been known for police to get injured etc.. so I won't be that happy on that night. Gah.
