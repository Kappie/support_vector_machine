But I've had requests to update so here it is:  Well anyone that didn't know, I went to some Key Club weekend retreat for the executive board members of a bunch of the local key clubs. I had no idea what to expect, but it actually turned out pretty fun. It ended up being at a beautiful cabin in the middle of NOWHERE (the nearest store was 20 minutes away) on the shore of Lake Gaston. There were like 20 something representaives from I think 6 of the local high schools, and everyone turned out to be really fun. We all ended up bonding pretty well. We had to play all those "summer campy seemingly stupid but fun anyway teamworky" kind of games- yeah you know the kind. Those were fun but we had to talk about our clubs A LOT which wasn't all that fun. But we also got to go tubing and water skiing on the lake which WAS FUN. But yeah overall it was a pretty successful weekend.  One really important thing that I got out of it was that our key club in the past has been so extremely bad, not an accurate representation of key club at ALL, (the kiwanis club basically hated us it was so bad) and that by being president this year I have the chance to bring it back up to par. We have a lot of things planned, even some stuff with some of the other high schools, and it's gonna be a really fun year. We have a goal of 20 members per class to join, so I really hope all of you that are reading this would consider joining. The whole K-family (ask if you don't know what it is) is a really awesome organization that does some really great stuff. So JOIN KEY CLUB. Please, it's not only fun but if you're active than it's really rewarding. If you have any questions or have no idea what it is or something, just talk to me.
