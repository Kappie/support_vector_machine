So...i'm exhausted lately. i can never get enough sleep and when i do sleep i've had really wierd dreams. my current odd dream goes like this...  so i'm on a train and i'm just hanging out and i see my cat on the railroad tracks. what in the heck, so i pick her up and put her in a plastic bag and then in my pocket. i made sure i didn't twist the bag so she could breathe. later these two guys start chasing me through the dining cars and sitting cars of the train. it was really weird. i escaped and i checked on elektra because i was worried she would of had a bumpy ride. i reached in my pocket and she was a little kitty and also notice that somehow the bag had twisted and she wasn't breathing. i screamed oh my gosh *frantic nurturing* i undo the bag and she's dead. i hold her in my hands and she's just dead.  weird thing is, is that lex has been really affectionate lately. i think she knows. *shiver* so that was awfully traumatic. other news, umm Darien's rents won't let him play baseball. i feel really bad, but there isn't much i can do. me and deutaronomy gave him a big hug yesterday but nothing seems to cheer him up. also, he informed me that his dad is on him for how expensive everything is...bell rang! g2g.
