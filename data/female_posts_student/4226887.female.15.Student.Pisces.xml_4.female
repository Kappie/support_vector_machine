On the outside Crystal is outgoing, popular and never has problems making friends. I, on the other hand seem to be the opposite. Lately, at school I think I've become portrayed as the moody, smart, artistic, quiet girl. This image wasn't really that strong until the end of the year. I have discovered that reading a book when you have free time in class sparks some unusual comments such as : "You can read a book really fast, that's lame." or "You must be really smart if you can read like that". But, we as humans judge every book by it's cover. I wouldn't consider my self really smart but I suppose by high school standards I might be considered lame. Reading has just turned out to be an ideal way to escape for me. Well, on the outside Crystal and I are quite different but on the inside I suppose you could say we are quite identical to how we view our lives.      Anyways, one of the subjects of our recent email was "What would you do if you could go back 6 months to a year in your life. If you knew then what you know now? How different would your life be?". Crystal and I both agreed that our lives would be a lot better. Immediately when I thought of this, three situations I would have dealt with differently popped into my head.     3.      Cut ties with Anne Marie-  If I had told Anne Marie to go away then there would no longer be any lesbian rumors of me floating around the school. I wouldn't have to listen to Cody talk of how he thinks she's in love with me. I wouldn't have to worry about her running to tell Cody all of my secrets. Crystal and I might not have stopped being friends for so long. Everything I told Anne Marie about Crystal when we were fighting, Crystal would find out. I cannot count the number of times I have been stabbed in the back by this bitch.           2. Told Tommy to get lost-  The first time anything really happened between me and Tommy was at Homecoming. He started talking to Me, Crystal and Anne Marie. Anne Marie asked him to dance. He said no then asked me to dance in front of her. By Monday we were dating. Tuesday we went on our first date. Wednesday I wanted to dump. Thursday he wrote me a poem. (Crystal suggested that to break up with him I write a poem). And on Friday I dumped him. What can I say, he was a senior who had failed English 9. He was almost 19 and I was a freshman who was 10 times as mature as him.           1. Logan-  The way I acted towards this man is THE GREATEST REGRET IN MY LIFE. He chased me for 3 months. I made dates and broke dates with him. He gave me rides home and we flirted through text messaging. I wasn't interested and finally broke his heart. Karma would have it that I am now head over heels in love with this guy. I have gotten through the phase where I cry every night over him. But I would still do anything to have him. I don't deserve him, understandably. I wrote him an apology letter about two months and have yet to recieve a reply from him. The funny thing is EVRYONE I knew told me to go out with him. Crystal says that if I want to get over him then we'll have to find me a new boyfriend. Easier said than done.         Now looking back on this list numbers 2 and 3 are nothing compared to the way I feel about number 1. But that's life for ya. You make mistakes and get your ass kicked, emotionally speaking, and you learn.
