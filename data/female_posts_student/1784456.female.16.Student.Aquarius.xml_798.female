WOW!  urlLink http://www.winamp.com  I've got this cute Sakura one on... hmm... doesn't quite go with the rock music but oh well! I got it from here  urlLink http://www.cartoonparty.net/index.html?http://www.cartoonparty.net/skins.html . Ok, ok, so it's in Italian or some thing but the people ripped it so it's ok... I guess... any way the skin isn't Italian so it's ok. But it doesn't tell you how to install it! (And for a dumb person like you, boy was it hard!) Yeah yeah... well... it was! So I walked around and got to here  urlLink http://www.winamp.com/nsdn/winamp2x/dev/skins/zip.jhtml  *dumdadeee link girl!* Well yeah, I don't explain stuff well ya know! Any hoo, apparantly you put it in a ZIP file then rename it some thing .WSZ and put it in C:/Program Files/Winamp/Skins or whatever it is! Wow, fun! Geez, I have a new toy to get all excited over! YEAY! Any way... angry moaning blog next! YEay!
