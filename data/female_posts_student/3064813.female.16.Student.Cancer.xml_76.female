May sunspots burn in the fiery pits of something nasty!   So, apparently we can now change font and font size. This is cool, but is also in a way very sad because it forces me to figure out what font looks best with my happy template. And once I figure out the font I will then need to decide what size it ought to be. And once I figure out the size it will look differently than I thought it did at first and will have to go through the whole huge problem all over again. This troubles me.    I am a troubled person.    I probably need medication, but the odds are really good that even if it was given to me I'd probably flush it down the toilet because-- hhf! I AM ME, neuroses included. I don't think I spelled that right.    Anyways.    Nothing much has been going on lately, and I know I have been neglecting my godgiven duties as a blogger-nerd and such.... My traitorous mind thinks it has better things to do than talk to myself via a web-journal.    Hmm.    Whatever.    My friend Brittney is visiting from Boise now, that's cool. We went to the beach yesterday and went BOOGIE BOARDING although I suck and couldn't catch a good wave if my life depended on it. At any rate, I'm horribly out of shape and therefore am in a considerable amount of pain due to the strain put upon my muscles both attempting to boogie board and struggle against the current of the black-hearted sea.    I'm at the library. I don't quite understand whether that has anything to do with anything, but it seemed like a good thing to say, so I said it.    Nng. I'm hungry. Stupid diets.    Ummmm this is not fair, that the library's computer which has been molested by various grubby people is in better condition than my own, dear computer whom I lovingly call Baxter (because it-- he, whatever-- is a crazed psychopathic lunatic, and such things deserve names or a kick in the face).    Er, right. So I think I'm going to go lounge on a couch or something and do some sulking, because that sounds like it would be a fun thing to do. I drew some things that I want to post on DA but daddy stole my scanner (or took it back from the real thief or something) and so I can't use it because he scares me and I don't like going into his office with his TWO cool computers grrr.    Bye.
