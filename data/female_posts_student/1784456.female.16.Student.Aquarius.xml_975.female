Hmm... Sorry, I woke up at about 11:30 so my body's a bit weird... but hell, it's generally weird. I actually got up at 7... well woke up, but I thought damn this I'm going bad to bed! Teehee! Have lie ins! Yeah! Remind me to find out how to spell that too! Yeay! Did I mention that I love ebay too? Yes! I think I did! Wow, small world aye? (Well, this pink box you live in is quite small) Hey, it's got everything I need. Ok, ok, stop talking... people are freaking... Hehe...
