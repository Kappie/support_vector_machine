The reason why she's glad is that way her boyfriend can sleep over. That makes me mad because now she's not sleeping over on saturday. I should see what my cousin is doing i'll give her a call tonight. Yea my sister has life eay. Yesterday/last night. I had to be nice and lock her bike up and then I had to cream her toast even though I didn't want to. Life sucks for me. My best friend doesn't care about me all she cares for is her boyfriend. I laugh because we told each other that we wouldn't let guys get between us and well I kept up my promise. That's why when Jenifer and Casey don't get along I get mad. Because I told her that just cause me and him are dating that's not gonna change our friendship at all. I told him the same thing just cause where dating doesn't mean that i'll ignore my chick friends. He understands that. I really hope that my cousin wants to come out this weekend. I don't know. Saturday I'm thinkin of sleepin all day. Unless my parents are going to the GreyMountLock. I think that's what it's called. If they go i might go or like I said I'll sleep all day. Today, when I woke up I thought I might have pink eye cause it was all bloodshot and red and it felt as if I had redeye. I might I don't know. This afternoon Jen and I are taken bus fifteen. We have to because we gonna go to the park and her mom will be home and her mom thinks that she's stayin after today at school so we can't walk by her house. I hope at 2:00 i can go to the gym and get a soda. I hope so. Joe was gonna ride his bike today to school but took a fall on it. So, now he's gonna have to have it fixed. Well, that's all for now. same time next week!
