He got tired of me beating him at Chess !  Ha. Ha. We would've played Monopoly, but Brian's grandma hates it. I asked her once, "Why? But I heard that you're so good at it ! " She finds it boring because she always wins.    I have some close up shots of my hair from the back and from the side. They're in the archives of SMEAGHE TODAY. Is that where your sister saw it? Or is she just basing her opinion on the portrait below? The portrait really doesn't do it justice. I loved what the hair stylist did to my hair !     The email address that you should use is  ching@digitalrice.com  or  ching@liquid2k.com . Brian and I are thinking of getting a cable modem. We are sick of our slow-ass connection. I think, with his promotion and everything, we'll be able to wing it.  =)
