Everything seems to be predicted by me in the past.. I did said before, we'll never be together and now we did it.. That hurts alot... Really.. I really hope that we're like in the past and happily facing each and everyday in the school with laughter and fun... Now, everything is impossible.. Time can never turn back to last year... Lost time is never found again...
