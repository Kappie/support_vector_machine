To make all of your past entries Friends-Only or Private, you must edit each entry individually (http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=2) to change the security level on each one. LiveJournal does not provide a way to change all of your past journal entries from Public to Friends-Only or Private with one command. See http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=24 for details about the various security settings.   Many clients available for download include the ability to edit journal entries. This may speed up the process of converting your previous entries to Friends-only or Private. For more information on your preferred client, consult its documentation or its menu options. See http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=158 for information on downloading a client.                       *   LiveJournal does provide the means to set a minimum security level on all posts you may make in the future. Setting this option will prevent you from slipping up and posting a public entry that you meant to post as Friends-only or Private. You will still be able to post an entry with a lower security setting by posting it with the minimum security you have set, then editing it to change the security setting.   To set the minimum security level of all future entries in your journal, log in (http://www.livejournal.com/login.bml) and go to the Admin Console (http://www.livejournal.com/admin/console) and execute the following command:   set newpost_minsecurity     Do not enter the   symbols; these are only for reference purposes. To set the minimum security level to Friends-only, replace   with "friends". To set the minimum security level to Private, replace   with "private". To turn off the minimum security level, replace   with "public".                       *   If you maintain a community, you can set the minimum security level to "friends only" by executing the following command:   set for   newpost_minsecurity friends   Do not enter the   symbols; these are only for reference purposes. Replace   with the username of the community.
