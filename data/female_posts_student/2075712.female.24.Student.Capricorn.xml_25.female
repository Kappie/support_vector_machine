Why weren't Lil' Kim's outfits a big deal ?  But I finally saw a close up of what Janet Jackson was wearing and finally realized how wrong it was to do this at a family watched event.  I don't think she meant for the red lace part to come off to...but who knows...I guess it could have been a publicity stunt.  If you look closely, it's not even covering her nipple...  I don't really care...but if I had kids I probably wouldn't feel the same.    Anyways...on to something new.  I'm getting decent $$$ back from my taxes...YYYYEEEESSS !!! I'm also going to splurge on  urlLink MAC  products.  Thankfully I found out about this great sell at Bendel's which is in New York.  I'm in Cali but you can place orders over the phone and it will be included as part of their big sale!  Basically, for every $100 you spend, you get $50 off.  So, I'm buying $300 worth of MAC and only paying $150 plus $9 shipping for the whole thing!!  That's the absolute best sale I've ever heard of for MAC products...actually it's for the whole Bendel's store too !
