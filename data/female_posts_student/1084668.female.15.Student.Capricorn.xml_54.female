The snow quietly falls on the gentle slope, now I put your favorite flower in your room  even though I know it will never reach you.   when I remembered our unyielding promise  from last year's last day of snow, it began to melt,  and spill from my hands.   The snow quietly falls on the gentle slope, now I put your favorite flower in your room  even though I know it will never reach you.   As I remember you watching the snow from the window all alone,  I recall you through the window and give you one last kiss...   please, smile, stop your crying now... I'm always watching you from here.   The snow quietly falls on the gentle slope, now I put your favorite flower in your room  even though I know it will never reach you.  All over the city quietly colored white by the light, the last seasonal color you saw.  you shed tears, reality is cruel isn't it? the last seasonal color you saw.   The colors of you have finally disappeared with the four seasons the snow melts and flowers bloom on the street.  the "shades" you saw are melting.  the last day of snow this year  (one flower in the street, when I looked up to the sky,  the final snow was pouring from the palm of my hands)   Ain`t afraid to die ....          But would youu cryy ..?
