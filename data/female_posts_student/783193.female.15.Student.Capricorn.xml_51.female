I hope second quarter is equally or less hard. Jieun, Navenus and I realized that we all bought the same pajamas from Costco... so we're going to be triplets tomorrow for practice. They're not the same colors, though. Mine are a puke-sea green. And we have to pick up trash for school spirit or something like that during lunch. Just great. And some guy at our school got in a fight during lunch, was punched, and is now in a coma. Wow. Biggest thing since homecoming, which I didn't even attend. Okay ladies, it's time to go do some Beryllium research, and it's really cold, so bundle up well. The good thing is we don't have to look at butts and boobs and who knows what else at school all the time now. The skanky girls have enough sense to put on a jacket, or at least a gauzy sweater, thank goodness. And, Jieun and I have made it official-- it feels like Christmas! Not only is the cold a nice change, festivity is in the air! We've been spreading the joy around during cross country, and even Brewer admitted that we made him feel happy. Speaking of Brewer, he was telling me that before a race, I need to unleash my inner animal and frighten away the opponents, or intimidate them, at least, and so I was wondering what my inner animal was. I asked him, and he thought for a little while, and finally came up with, "A duck." That sent Jieun, who was listening, into gales of laughter, and then he told her that hers was a gerbil. What a supportive coach. Sometimes I think he recruits people just to make fun of them. Okay, here it is; the news of the century: Cissy is coming back from China for a visit on December 12! Mark your calendars, we're going to have major fun every second she's back. Plus, she's got tons of shopping, eating, and white-guy oogling (ha, ha.) to do. We can't let her down... With that in mind, Later days!
