Yesterday was awesome 'cause Nick, Matt M, Dyllan and I went downtown for the Switchfoot concert. It was REALLY good. Totally amazing. Switchfoot ended the set without playing  Dare You To Move  and I was so upset because that's my favourite song by them and I couldn't believe they didn't play it. But then everyone started chanting for an encore, so of course, they come back on stage and THEY PLAYED  DARE YOU TO MOVE . How wonderful! It inspired me to actually learn something on an instrument so that Matt, Nick, Kevin and I could actually play something at our next "jam session". Radtastic.  And this morning, I met Alex, Andy's little brother and he is SO COOL! I tried to convince Mrs. Gabruch not to leave until after Wednesday so Alex could join us at Youth. Everyone, if you meet Mrs. Gabruch, tell her not to leave till Thursday! And Alex really is really cool. :)  Anyway, I went to the library today and got a bunch of movies, so I think I'll watch those now.
