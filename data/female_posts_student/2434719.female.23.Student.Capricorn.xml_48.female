BUT, say this is someone you're pretty close with, or hold a special place for, but you don't really know thier friends or thier family... you have no common denominators. what happens then??? just one day you keep trying to reach them, and they never respond?  isn't that a horrible wonderment?  i hate it when people say they want a happy party at thier funeral. no you bitches are going to cry, or else il'l come haunt you. I AM JUST KIDDING.  there better be a margarita machine.  you know what makes me giggle? the thought that maybe, just maybe... after i die, someone will think of this and say, "she wanted us to have a margarita machine!".... and i'll be planning the party from the grave, giggling my decaying ass off cause you're letting me boss you around and i'm dead.  that's a morbid morning for you. the banana in my cereal was HUGE today. i sure now how to pick em.
