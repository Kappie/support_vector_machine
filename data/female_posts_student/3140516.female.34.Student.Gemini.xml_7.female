If you are that desperate for friends, go out and get a life away from the computer. Talk to some real people, not just screen names in a chatroom or on a list. Find a hobby, get involved in a class, fall in love, fall out of love, whatever... AND SPEAKING OF LOVE: It is IMPOSSIBLE to fall in love with and get married to someone online that you have never met in real life. That is another thing I am tired of: Online weddings and handfastings. Do you know how demeaning that idea is to people involved in real life relationships? Especially when a supposedly Pagan couple has an online handfasting when they have never even met in real life. HELLO... A handfasting is meant to PHYSICALLY BIND THE HANDS TOGETHER, symbolizing the unbreakable bond you have with that person. It is not possible to physically bind someone to another over a computer. All that is is really bad playacting, and even worse, it is nothing but words. How can you promise to be faithful to someone you have never met, and who you wouldn't be the slightest bit interested in even if you did actually meet them in real life? Are we suddenly in the middle ages again, when families promised to marry their unborn children to other unborn children, and then actually followed through on it? When the fuck did this happen? And how? I must have missed the big reversal of time that transported us back through the centuries.  Get a life, people! If you want to get to know someone, take the time to talk to them about mundane things, and then actually MEET them. Get to know them, really know them. Not just through a computer screen. One of the best people I have ever met, I actually took the time to meet in person. She is wonderful, and I would do anything for her that it is within my power to do, I care that much about her. I wish she and I had both not been so fucked up at the time we met, because I think I will have feelings for her for the rest of my life, but that all got screwed up through each of our problems, and the addition of a third party. Anyway, she and I did not work, no matter how much I wanted us to, and out of resentment and pain, I lashed out at her. I wish I could take the things back and make it so they had never happened, but I can't. All we can do is move on. And we have. We recently started talking again, and even if friendship is all we are supposed to achieve in this life with each other, it is fine. Because I know her as a person. Not as some faceless voice on the computer. I made the effort. Now, if those of you out there who think you are so "in love" with the person you think you have made a connection with can't make the effort to actually meet the other person, in a safe way(like telling friends and family about them, and meeting in a public place), then how much in love can you possibly be?
