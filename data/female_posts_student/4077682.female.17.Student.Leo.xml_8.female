He is amazing and so cute, and really smart. :) I can talk to him about anything and we have so much fun together. I think the PDA can annoy some ppl somtimes.. but wtv. We don't get to be alone together as much as I would like cuz we're always in a big group, but we're working on it.      Then there is my Micks twin brother Liam. He's super smart too, and sarcastic, but really fun to hang out with. It's hard to get him to say what's on his mind sometimes cuz, as sam would say, "he's intraverted". hahah. But yah. he's awsome.      Now Braxton. Hes such a cool guy. Hes brutally honest, and is the only person who can make you feel better with an insult. You can also talk to him about anything. Its good to get advice from him.  He's going out with my friend Bobbi. awwwww      And.. Derek. As sam said, he's just a big kid, a really really big kid. 6" wtv.. i dunno. He's fun to be with, but WALKS TOO FAST....: hahah and sometimes he really sticks his foot in his mouth. Good times.       Well theyre great guys and they've helped make this summer one of the best I've ever had. That is it....buh bye.
