So this statue, also titled Cora, is now in the Botanical Gardens there and has been sold over and over again.  Anyway, so cut to current day and Cora is about to get married, her reception is being held in Don Wiegan's house (which is the house/studio I took all the pictures of below).  The house is unreal, it was brilliant, I loved it immediately.  It used to be a slaughter house a long while back but he has built onto it and slowly transformed it into this amazing studio and house.  I just can't even begin to explain what an effect it had on me. So anyway, my first cousin once removed, Evan, arranged for us to go by and see it since it was Cathy's and my first trip to St. Louis and we've always heard about this statue and plus my mom and Babs wanted to see it as well.  So on our way out to Jill's after the shower we stopped by.  Anyway, I linked his website to the title above.  If you want to read up about him and his accomplishments click on the title of this post.
