Even though my sunscreen doesn't work AT ALL. I look like a freaking lobster right now I'm so sunburnt. Damn. The only bad thing that happened besides that was that poor Paul got carsick. :-( Boo. And you know what else really sucks? I have to go back to band camp tomorrow morning. God! Boo for band camp. I think they should just move band camp to Paul's house ;-) lol. I was reading over my old old posts, and I just kept thinking, "God, I was really funny. I guess I'm just not very funny anymore." Lol, its so true. My recent posts kinda suck. Sorry. Just have a lot going on. If my brother has a sleepover here tonight, I will be royally pissed. I have to wake up super duper early for band tomorrow, I really don't want a bunch of strange 13 year old boys roaming around my house. Grr. Anyways, Catchstone had their last show before college on Friday. *tear* I'm gonna miss those guys. Oh boy, my brother just set something on fire. No, I'm not kidding. Lol.
