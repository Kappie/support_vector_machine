He slips and slides everywhere because we have hard wood floors.  He's crazy.  Jonathan Elliot won him for me at the fair by throwing a ping pong ball, hence his name, in a little bowl in a kid's pool.  lol It was very exciting.  But anyways...I think  I accidently just pushed the bold and italics on without me knowing it.    I have no idea how that happened.   Okay, back to normal.  That was weird. But anyways, I'm looking for Usher dates that he's going on tour.  I had the chance to go to the one in Ohio but I backed out.  I'm mad that I did, too.  He's not coming to KY either.  Oh well.  I found out Tim McGraw is coming back to town and my dad is going and I'm not.  That makes me mad also.  Oh well, I can't go that day anyway because I'm suppose to be going to the KY and Louisville football game with a friend of mine that goes to UK so that's okay.  I'm looking for other concerts I can go to in the next couple months but I haven't found any yet.  I'm going to a Casting Crowns concert in October.  They're a Christian band. It's a surprise for one of my friend's birthday so I'm excited about that.  But anyways, enough about my concert craze lol  Tonight I had to work, only 5-9 though.  I had the early shift.  After I got off I hung out at Subway with Doug E Fresh lol yeah I'm a loser I was spose to go with Luke and Whitney to Lincoln Co. at the Kentucky Depot or something like that but they had to leave before I got off so I had nothing to do.  I went and saw Riley at Kroger too  lol I was really bored and now I'm home bout to do some of my poems and find that stuff for the poem extreme (i changed it to that from that other big word because i have no idea how to spell it)  And then I have to work on my theme analysis also for Ms. Hager.  Dangit I swear everything I do over the weekend dealing with homework is for Ms. Hager. lol Is that a bad thing?  Maybe.  But anyways I'm going to get off here and go finish looking for tickets.  Cya!
