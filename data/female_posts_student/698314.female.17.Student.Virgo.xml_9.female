There was so much fucking drama during the senior trip.  Rumors and people being bitches and all... it just all got on my nerves.  Maybe I didn't have so much fun because I am not actually part of a group as far as friends go, I don't really have many.  I always felt like an outsider, no matter where I was or who I hung out with.  It wasn't cool.  Softball trip was awesome though! OMG i don't think I've laughed or had so much fun in four days then I did then.  Oh well.  Im glad to be home though.  That's really all I wanted during most of the senior trip.  To go home and get away from some people and shit going on.  I don't really feel like going into too much detail about the trip.  If you want more details  you'll just have to ask and I'll probably tell you.  Wednesday we got to go in late to school. That was nice.  I didn't sleep in, but the break was still nice. Did my usual training after school.  We did like nothing in classes.  It was quite nice I must say.  Thursday was another day in school but again we did like nothing.  We had a game on Thursday at Willingboro.  That was alright, we killed them, practiced and still made it back to school in time for me to see the last few innings of the baseball game.  That was cool too cause the guys won in extra innings! During the softball game some girl from 'boro got hit and was like i hurt my uturus.  It was funny.  Friday was the physics trip to great adventure.  That was fun for the most part.  I was kinda tired of amusement parks but it was ok.  Whit tried to force me on Nitro and I almost cryed.  Funniest part was her getting the RV physics shirt! haha Oh good times.  Then back to school for training (like normal).  That was fun.  Spent some time with Jill and Miss C.  Then they all left me and we had a night game against RV.  We won't talk about that though.  >:-/ Got home around 9:30. Was back at school this morning for lax practice and a frosh baseball game.  I couldn't stay that long though because I had to go work a birthday party for the 2 little girls I babysit for.  There was 32 kids there! It wasn't that bad though.  Then I picked up my prom dress from being altered.  I can't believe it's in less than a week!! I can't believe it's May already no less!! Just a few more months! wahoo!! Now Im sitting here bored as hell.  I might actually do some homework in a little while.  Probably not though! oh well I don't feel like typing anymore so yea... later
