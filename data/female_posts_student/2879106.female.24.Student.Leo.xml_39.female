We haven't even really had a chance to have any fun when we hang out because I have had to be in bed so early. "Life sucks donkey balls and then you die." Anyway, Alek is leaving on Tuesday and hopefully if all goes well I will be able to go with him to help move him in. Until then I plan to spend every waking moment with him. I am just getting so upset with the idea of him leaving. I am trying to keep a happy face because I know he is nervous and I don't want to him to be anymore upset about the move. I am sure everything will be cool. Hell Dad went to Germany for a while when he was in the army and Mom did okay. AND THE ARE STILL TOGETHER. I think we will be okay. I just wish I could go with him. Unfortunetly, I am just not ready yet. I like my life here and I am just not ready to leave USI. It would be nice to move out on my own but I think I am going to have to do that here. Granted if I can move out here I should be able to move out to anywhere in the country, but out of state tuition it just too much. I might as well just go to UofE. (Which I have decided isn't as good of a school as USI because it's more expensive and the education you get there isn't any better) You ask how do I know this? Well I have been talking to people around town and everyone that I have talked to that goes there isn't very happy with the school. Okay time to stop rambling and time to get back to the subject of this blog. Well anyway I am just scared about this year. It is going to be so hard to get through it without Alek being here for support. I know that he will be just a phone call away but I just don't want us to get into any relationship problems because of this. I love him so much and I know that he is the man that I want to marry. We just have to work through this and become stronger because of it. I just hope it all works out.
