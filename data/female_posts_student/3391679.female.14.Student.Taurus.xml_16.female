The other cousins do the Im-getting-my-5minutes-of-cousin-time-in-then-im-out-of-here. Chris was always different. You know calling just to catch up and go out or taking me with him to work. which let me tell you was on stage and i would never let ppl know but i want to be on stage acting. why dont i tell u ask. B cuz i dont want it to seem like im following him aroun being exzactly like him even though inside i think we r kindve alike. ne ways he moved out of my aunts house and last night he had graduation for his ged. Thats wen i realized he was gone. No more want to go for a ride. usually just to pick someone up or u wanna go up the mountain. U know so i guess what im saying is the one i look up to is gone and i will miss him forever.
