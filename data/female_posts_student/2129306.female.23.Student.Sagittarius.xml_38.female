I'm horrified and appalled, and a bit sad, but that's life. We move on. Things change, and people sure as hell do.    And for the record, although I might be a bit jaded at times, really, I'm not so bad-the cold hard truth is just that- the truth -and IT HURTS sometimes.    Meanwhile...   All is well in Springfield-but the budget address is tomorrow-yikes-may God have mercy on the citizens of IL-bc rumor has it that a lot of them are going to be hurting after tomorrow.  With that said-I'm going to sleep to prepare for a long day downtown.
