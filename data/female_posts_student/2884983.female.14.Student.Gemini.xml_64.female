It hurts so much, and I have a punding headache to go on top of it. I really dont want to go to school tomorrow even though we havea  soccer game. we have had 2 practices and two games. it is really pathetic. I am so sick and tired of being sick and tired. no matter how much I sleep I dont feel rested and it is beginning to get on my nerves. I wish I had a magic wand that I could wave and **poof** all better. goddess I would be constantly using that. I wish I was an animal. preferibly a tiger. or any of those big cats. I lost my knife and I cant find it. it is making me mad, and  i really dont like not having it. my ear is getting infected again. damn. my knees are screwed. and to top it all off my room is really messy because I moved my bed. sometime this week I think I should fix it. my bed has been in the same place for such along time that it is driving me mad...argh. ...stupid headache. it is stopping my reading. because it makes my eyes hurt alot so I cant see very well. I love to read and I dont know what I will do if I cant read. mom didnt tape Inu Yasha for me when I went to Marie's b-day party. i am mad. I am mad quite alot today. but I dont mind although sometimes it can be quite tiring.....maybe thats why I am always tired....oh well.  ihave to remember to drink more water. I realize that I drink mybe two bottles a day. and I dont mean the big bottles. well I have typed quite a bit after not typing for a while, I think I am going to go gaia.
