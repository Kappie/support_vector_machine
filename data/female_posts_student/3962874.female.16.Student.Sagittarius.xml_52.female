Are they crazy? There is seriously a hole in her leg and I can see the muscle and the vein. My mom told them exactly what it looked like and they said that they don't consider that an emergency! There is a hole in my cats leg. If my mom had a camera I would take a picture and post it... I know it's nasty and noone would probably want to see it but you would definatley say that it is an emergency! Oh well we'll see what happens. Daniel, mom and I went shopping at the mall. I have a hard time finding jeans that fit me because I'm tall but when I shop at Abercrombie they usually have long sizes that don't hang down in the crotch or go up to my belly button (which I prefer not to have). Anyway, we went there and I tried on four pairs of pants all of which were totally different styles and none of them fit me right. I think I gained weight in some wierd place because they felt really odd. You know how sometimes the pants are tighter in some places than in others? Well they were all like that on me! I also tried on a few pairs at American Eagle. It was really wierd because I tried on long sized pants and they were barely long enough. It like their long sizes aren't really long. Oh well. Anyway, I still need to buy pants and that was really what I was going for today and I didn't even buy one pair. I did buy a really cute jacket from Abercrombie though. It's a short trench and it's like a cotton candy pink and I am in love with it. I also bought a coral colored sweater that goes off the shoulder. God I love shopping. Zack just rang the doorbell so I better go hang out.
