It is sad to know that America “the land of opportunity and freedom” has failed to keep to its constitution.   Sometimes I wonder whether who causes for this downfall, the people or the government.  I am not sure to answer that.  But somewhere in the book says you have to go out of the country to value America.  This is true.  Only if each American had a chance to go out of America, they will start to value their country more. Because there is a  lot going on outside of America that people should see and experience. Americans always shout about “patriotism”, wearing clothes of the American flag, having flags hanging from cars, houses etc.  But are they truly patriotic? Or just showing their “patriotism” to the outside world?  Most Americans are trapped in their own worlds.  They simply can’t accept the fact that other religions, cultures exists.  I think parents, teachers and leaders should start to teach the younger generation how to respect other cultures, and to value and respect their own cultures.
