Sorry...in case you couldn't tell, I'm not too keen on starting school this early. Then again, who would be? I still have a little bit of my summer work to do, but it shouldn't be bad...writing essays is never THAT bad...  Okay, so I'm lying a little. My brain is partially decayed from summer.  I'm not ready to go back...*whining, sobbing, and other annoying stuff*  Bleh.
