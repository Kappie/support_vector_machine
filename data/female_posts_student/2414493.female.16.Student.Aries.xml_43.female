See mathematicians have neglected the fact that sometimes the first 1 likes the second 1 and when you add them together you get a really BIG 1. Sometimes however the first 1 likes the second 1 but the second 1 doesn't reciprocate (share) the feelings so you are left with 1+1=.5+.5+1 since the first 1 is broken up over rejection. So next time you are asked what 1+1 equals think about it!  (for all you in Calc BC you could take the intigral of 1+1 get 2x and realize that now you have even more problems)
