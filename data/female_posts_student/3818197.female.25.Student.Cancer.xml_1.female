He said we should go pick up a video we had lend to our friend Rifka so as we walked out he suggest that I drove.  I went back inside the house to get my keys and wallet and as I turned around the corner to get into our bit up 1991 Geo Storm when... BEWARE AND BEHOLD!!!!! He had gone out behind my back and bought a PT Cruiser for my birthday!!!  It is sooooo beautiful!! It is a 2001 Limited Edition with niiiice leather interiors and keyless entry and it has a cd changer in it... I feel like a spoiled brat (I know I am), but this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.  So, needless to say my feet have been several inches off the ground due to my absolute disbelief that this is our new car!  Ok, enough about that, what it's really touching and really relevant to everyone else, is that last night we went and saw Farenheit 9/11 at the Flicks.  I really wasn't prepared by any means to come face to face with the reality of war as described by Michael Moore.  And even less by the reality of what this government is doing behind everyone's back.  I felt good and bad because even though as I left the theater I had learned so much, I can't forgive myself for having lived in such obliviousness through the 4 years of the reign of terror that has been Bush's presidency.  There is only one thing to say to all of this: this man (if you can call it that) cannot, be re-elected.  I feel I need to go bang on the INS's door and demand a citizenship just so I can go out and vote in November.  This country can't afford another year with this government. Is just not right. It hasn't been from day one, but it is still salvagable.  I guess I'm just in awe of how ignorant the general public truly is about what goes on at the higher levels of the government.  It makes sense that they keep us so busy looking at add and getting us to buy everything under the sun or keep us petrified with their ups and downs in the country's security levels.  By the way, yes, I did feel like an ass getting into our new car and driving home after such a compelling documentary.   I'm at a loss of words.
