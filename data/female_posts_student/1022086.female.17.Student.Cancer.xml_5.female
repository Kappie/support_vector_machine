The plan was to start homework in half an hour, but I still have to clean my bathroom, vacuum a bit, and shower, so... yeah.  There is a possibility of our adopting a homeless kitten to keep Shah company. He seems truly lonely and depressed, and I frankly don't think he would harm a kitten. However, I'm still a tad bit concerned, for should I be wrong, I'd be putting the cat in danger. The idea was not even mine-- surprisingly, it was my mom's. I'm not too sure I'm comfortable with the idea of subjecting another innocent cat to a tempestuously disastrous environment such as my home's; my family is, indeed, quite an odd one.   My mom and I have been pretty good friends for the past few weeks again. It's kind of odd. I know that something's bound to happen to ruin that, for it always does, but then everything's relative and periodical. Well, I should likely go do stuff now (maybe by 5 pm I'll start homework?) Anyone reading this, have a great and blessed week.  The following is my absolute favourite Tori Amos song. It is beautiful, passionate, and a joy to perform.      "Cooling" by Tori Amos  Maybe I didn't like to hear But I still can't believe Speed Racer is dead So then I thought I'd make some plans But fire thought She'd really rather be water instead  And Peggy got a message for me From Jesus And I've heard every word That she was saying And I know I have been Driven like the snow  This is cooling Faster than I can This is cooling Faster than I can  So then Love walked up to Like And said, "I know that you don't like me much. Let's go for a ride." This ocean is wrapped around that pineapple tree  And is your place in heaven  Worth giving up These kisses These, yeah These kisses?  And Peggy got a message for me From Jesus And I heard every word  That she had said  And I know that I have been Driven like the snow  But this is cooling This is cooling Faster than I can This is cooling Faster than I can  Yes, this is cooling This is cooling
