This last week has been hard to get through, because I have realized something, it makes me really disheartend for a certain situation. But I will get over it. No biggie.  I got my hair cut really short. It was done on thursday and my dad still hasn't noticed lol. Great isn't it. lol It makes me laugh just thinking about it. Lately everything seems to be going over his head.  I have been thinking a lot about the play and how it is over.  I have just seemed to be so lost with out that sensation of being on stage and being with really great people. Working with everyone was so great!!! I think i have been bitten by the stage bug.  It seems like a piece of my heart is gone,   I miss that play. I could have done it for another month, even longer.I really wish something was going on. Then i could get my  mind off things. I just feel like something is missing in my life and i am not sure what.  I feel like...well i am not quite sure. I feel different and not a good differnt.  I guess i just feel lost. I mean Even if i were to talk to someone i am not sure what i would tell them, because i dont know whats going on. But i know its something. Anyways more later bye.
