I gotta hand it to her, she is doing wonderfully with her twins...well from the looks of it, they look like very happy little girls.  That is usually a good indication of good parenting.  =)  Oh I have a dilemna.  We don't know where to keep Stitch.  Like which part of the yard because he is pooping everywhere.  UGH  Well his playmate will be leaving us soon, but he is just into everything.  It is so annoying, but Ed and the kids love him so we can't exactly get rid of him.  Anyway, I should get to bed, I have so many things to take care of tomorrow and I don't want to lag as usual.  Goodnite!
