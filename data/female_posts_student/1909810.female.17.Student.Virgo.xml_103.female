When I'm this tired I don't really know what I'm saying.  I miss so many people right now. All my lovely new friends from CSLC, my TL, my cousins, lovely Ms. Alaska,and more,i hate it. There's not a whole lot I can do about it though. My chai tea has become cold. well...lukewarm really. I have to start my application essays tomorrow. Bleck. I am not looking forward to this college application process. I dont have any clue where I want to go (other than northwestern which i wont get in to, and even if i did i couldn't pay for it).I get so frustrated over this whole thing. *sigh* blablablsakfdjslkjdfalakjs sorry. I'm tired, frustrated, and...I'm gonna stop writing to spare you all of my endless complaining, when i really dont have anything to complain about. Good night.
