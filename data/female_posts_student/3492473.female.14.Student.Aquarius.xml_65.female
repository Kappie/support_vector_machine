Granted it was almost noon, it was still breakfast. It was so nice. I mean we hadn't ate breakfast together as a family in like  months ! And I mean we hardly eat dinner together as a family so it was just cool. It's the simple things in life! (2) I really hope it stops raining because I wanna go to soccer practice tonight. I don't even mind that it's a work out day. I just need something to do. Soccer is my highlight of my week since my friends to seem to have forgotten about me. But it's cool. Pay back is a bitch. (wink, wink) I'm not even sure if soccer is canceled if it's raining. I hope it's not. It just keeps drizzling on and off so I hope that's all. I wanna play soccer!!  waaah!  Poem time...  Slowly Falling  "I love you too." I wish you meant it the same way I do. "I miss you." I want to believe that. "What would I do without you?" Think of her perhaps? "You’re my best friend." Then prove it.  I'm there to do your science project, And help you get the girl. You're there to help me up, And learn how to succeed. I'm too selfless, To think you care. You're too blind, To see how much I truly care. Lost without each other, Meant to be, Slowly falling, One harder than the other, And that's  me…
