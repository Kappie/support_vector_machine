Once is enough. Watching them twice is not very entertaining at all.   So this weekend is going to be what you could call fun, and I guess you could say I'm excited. Lauren's having a 16th birthday party at her lake house. (of course for all girls) Hopefully the weather dosen't suck because I wanna get TAN haha. Or I should probally say burnt, I really don't tan anymore, but it's ok cause my burn usually fades into a nice tan. Hopefully this weekend won't turn into a bitch fest being that there will be almost 10 girls,we all know that that could get ugly. Hopefully things will go well. My dad is also freaking out because he didn't realize I'd be gone for the weekend. He said he'd told people I would be at a cookout. Ohhhh...lets alert the press I can't be at a little family function (well I thought it was a family function) Then he made me aware that it was a cook-out with "her" family. Ugh..she is the most annoying repulsive sickening person I've ever met. I may sound like a bitch but it's true. I'm not even going to waste anyones time going on about her.  So Jasmine and myself decided that theres just something about punk guys haha. We decided on the whole tight Levi's theory a long time ago, but the other day we were at the mall and we just kept seeing (Jazzy's word)"sirens". haha I love you Jaz your one of the goofiest people I know but you can be so serious when I need you to, you rock. Anyway back to the point we decided you can look at an "abercrombie" boy and be awed by his amount of gorgeousness for a couple of minutes but with a punk-rocker boy, they just have this on going cuteness haha. Would you rather have a boy that stares in the mirror all day adoring his looks, or a guy who already knows he's hot and plays guitar all day. This paragraph is mainly for Jaz so sorry for all of you who think this is extremley dumb and don't understand but ...well your just going to have to get over it!  Monday kicks off soccer conditioning WOO-HOO, I'm looking foward to running my ass off, and being sore everyday from drills that I haven't done in forever! Yes practices twice a day, so I can have no other plans! I AM SOOO looking foward to Soccer. OK really it's not that bad, but I know it's gunna be a pain in the ass. Especially the 8:00 AM practices.   BoYs confuse me! They like to say one thing because they know it's what you want to hear but it's not really what they mean, they hide the truth. Hmmmm..or at least that's my opinion. For once I just wanna know FOR REAL, like what's REALLY going on , cause right now I kinda feel like I'm just waiting around to get fucked over. I hope I'm not but I can't help but to think that it's going in that direction I dunno, I guess time will tell.   The next few weeks are going to be no fun. Everyones going on vacation to some great place and I'm stuck here. Olivia's having bunches of fun in Italy , we email back and forth. Then Ashley's leaving to go on her cruise to Mexico. Lindsey's in Colorado. Then it seems like everyone else is going on vacation too. To leave me here all alone. Wishing I was anywhere but here.  I've been having this crazy craving for gatorade.   Nick seems to think Away from here sucks. I like them!! so quit being a jerk and shut up Nick cause I think their GoOd!! hahaha just joking don't get all serious on me.  AhHhHhH Voldermont is SCARY!!! ehhhhh!!!!!   I need to get a job really bad. I really need the money.  That was alot of random thoughts in a row...  Well I'm signing off for now, cause my eyes hurt. Maybe I should start wearing my contacts again, i'm going blind anyway so it dosent matter. haha. LaTeR...!
