I sent you all an invite, if you need one again email me cynsophie@yahoo.ca   2)Some of us are going to the golf shooting range at 6 (Jackie, Shoshannah, April, Anne-Sophie, Cynthia, the Swinging Sistahs). If you want to go, email we'll get organized.   WHERE: Rockliffe driving range to shoot a bucket of balls. A free expert giving us tips. It is very cheap $10 for 115 balls (so you share a bucket) and $2 to get clubs. (so $6 each)    3)  7:30  at Apryl's place. She couldn't post her message, so here it is for her.   Hey everyone!  As you know, I've invited y'all to my place for next Tuesday's meeting.  I actually live just in front of Jodi and Kim's place, so it's easy to find.  The address is 283 MacLaren St., and the apt. and buzzer # is 205.  I'm planning to make sangria (with white wine), but feel free to bring whatever you like.   There has been bits and pieces of discussion around Sex and the City and whether or not it can be read as a feminist show.  I would like to show a few clips from the show and hopefully delve deeper into the discussion.  I'm planning to also post some articles on our blog (if I can figure out how to do so).  I've also been reading a lot about Showtime's new series called The L Word, which is a show about a group of lesbians.  I've downloaded a few episodes, and I think it would be interesting to watch some clips and compare the female friendships and love relationships to those of SATC.   I think it would also be very interesting to hear why everyone has joined this group, and what each woman hopes to gain/contribute or discuss in future meetings.  Hope everyone can make it for some sangria and some Sexy conversation!!!     4) New Invitees:   I've added Rebecca  Sabine to join us. So please include them in your emails. They're 2 really awesome girls with great head on their shoulders, mucho pizzaz  style, fab ideas and great life experiences... amongst other things. So Welcome to you both, look forward to seeing you soon.:)     THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY! Can't wait to go golfing. At least this time, my brother won't be there to hit me in the head with his golf club like he did 12 years ago, the bastard! ;)   Anne-Sophie.
