Kristin, I'm sorry, but yours just does not fit. It's too small. *shrugs*   I'm happy-ish right now... I think it might be the Oreos. Or other things. This might be my blog, but definitely not my diary. Sorry to disappoint all ya pervs out there. *waves to skanky fifty-year-old men whose eyes are glued to screen*   *watches as they sadly flick off their computers and drive out on their Harleys to Denny's Bar*  Now... hmm... what is there to say? I bought Fiddler on the Roof on Sunday and I LOVE it. I've watched my wedding a thousand times. I think I like the dancing. I also have to watch Casablanca and finish West Side Story. Gah, I never have time for ANYTHING. I sit at the computer and talk to people... that's quite time consuming. Oh, and there's a history test tomorrow. *sigh*  I want there to be a nice sun and no mosquitos, so I can lie outside and enjoy sunset. Read a book and listen to Norah.   Oh, Sibling Deux made up a joke! Let's hear it.   SD: I have a joke! ME: Okay.  SD: Why did the dog, um... get into the oven, and then put in a bunch of dirt? ME: (typing in blog) What? SD: Why did the dog get in the oven and put dirt all over himself inside?  ME: (still typing) I don't know. SD: Because he wanted to be a hot diggety dog! ME: Oooh... cute.  (SD runs off happily, having told her joke.)  Yes, thus runs my life. I am FREEZING COLD and yay! It's time to put the hot pad on my leg. Because, you see, it still hurts. *waits for skeevy fifty-year-old men to send flowers* I like roses. Anyway, still cold... warm up, thing... soon...  How is my life? Decent, I suppose. I shall see y'all later.
