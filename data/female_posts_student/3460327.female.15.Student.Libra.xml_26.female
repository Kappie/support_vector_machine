Saying something and wishing you hadn't? or   Saying nothing and wishing you had?   I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say.   Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs.   Have u ever decided not 2 become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?   Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't.   You can't tell your heart what to do.   It does it on its own....when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.   Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?   Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much... for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.   Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?   We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we   don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.   But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.   Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.   Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could have had.   * What would you do if every time you fell in love you had to say good-bye?   *What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be there?   *What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt?   (even if it is that you don't care anymore)   *What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't have them?   *What would you do if you never got the chance to say I am friends with all of my family and they know I love them?*   People live, but people die. And I want to tell you that   you are a friend.   If you died tomorrow, you would be in my heart.   Would I be in yours?   If you care about me as much as I care about you, you will send this back   You might be best friends one year,   prettygood friends the next year,   don't talk that often the next,   and don't want to talk at all the year after that.   So, I just wanted to say,   even if I never talk to you again in my life,   you are special to me and   you have made a difference in my life,   I look up to you,   respect you, and   truly cherish you.   Send this to all your friends,   no matter how often you talk,   or how close you are,   and send it to the person who sent it to you.   Let old friends know you haven't forgotten them,   and tell new friends you never will.   Remember, everyone needs a friend,   someday you might feel like you have NO FRIENDS at all,   just remember this e-mail   and take comfort in knowing   somebody out there cares about you   and .. always will..    I LOVE YOU!!!!    Send this to all the friends that you have...all the friends that you've lost...and to all the friends you've lost touch with...just to let them know that you care...send this back to the person who sent it to you if you consider them a friend as well!
