I mean seriously!! Somebody please save me!!! Today started off pretty ok..it was raining and I spent the night with Britt and then this morning she and I went to the Donut Shop for breakfast and Shane dropped by..I swear they can't get enough of each other!!! THey just saw each other last night!! and then again this morning!!! I can understand like on the weekends or something but on a school day seemed somewhat weird to me...maybe thats just me but yeah..aha anyways so we get to school she takes Raegan t oher class and we go to the Highschool and drop off the donuts for the Basketball Teams party thingymajig and then we went to class soaking wet basically aha but it was fun and so the day was just the greatest and then all of a sudden this "moody spell" hit me and whew there went my day..or so I thought.....I was just not a happy person throughout the end of 5th period 6th period 7th period and part of Driver's Ed. I don't know what it was I mean I just like had so many things pop into my head and I started thinking about all of them at once and thats just a hard concept aha so then I don't know I got happy again in Driver's Ed. b/c just some things couldn't have been more perfect....Colby was in there and I got my hug!! aha during one of the breaks...I was happy from there on out.. He's been really sweet to me lately which is definatly a good thing...aha he and I have been talking a heck of alot more and I'm opening up to him alot more now so that's another good thing well I was goin to go to the movies with them tonight to see Van Helsing but NOOOO my Dad said that he was too tired and was like tell them to come to Tinseltown it's closer! I was like no it's not then of course he went into this whole long drawn out thing explaining how it was closer or whatever I didn't listen to the majority of it...and then I just sat in his chair the rest of the time thinking "I could be at the movies right now with COLBY!!! but Noooo Daddy has to be a meanie!!!" so yeah ahha but hopefully he'll get on later on after the movie..I hope he does...well anyways I gotta go so I'll talk later on!!! today has just been so eventful aha there's alot more but I think it's long enough for now aha Love you!!! Bye!
