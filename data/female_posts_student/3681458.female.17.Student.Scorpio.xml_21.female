I have all the support I need.  It's over, and I don't ever want to see his ugly face again. I finally met Asher last night.  He's fucking cool, and I know why Alex hangs around him all the time.  Al and I decided we're gonna hang out more.  He's the one who found the sign yesterday.  We all wanted to do so many things, but my dad took care of that.  I could have a restraining order put on Ben if I wanted.  I want to see his ass in jail man.  My dad would be more than happy to put it there.  Al and Asher had barbed wire and were going to wrap it around his tires or something... But I was like  no, he's probably already shitting in his pants b/c of the phone call he got.  I don't want us to do anything so it could screw up my dad's plans.   Quintin is awesome.  He always makes me laugh when I am down.  Emi and I both layed on his shoulders while watching the movie last night.  It was fun.  But the movie was boring.  An independent film as usual and of course Emi loved it.  It was about a midget.  I hated it, and talked to Alex the whole time.  Quintin had already seen it, so he was telling us the story.. bah. Asher was absorbed in it.  Like it took a while to interrupt his concentration on the movie. Oh, went to go see Spider Man 2 with my brother yesterday.  It was awesome.  I liked it better than the first. =)  That's all for now.
