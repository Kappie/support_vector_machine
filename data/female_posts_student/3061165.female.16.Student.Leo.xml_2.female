It's not necessary at all, why did we get elcord thingy anyway? We already learned how to do summary there! Had been doing nothing but summaries thingies de whole lesson. Haiz.. After which we had Miss See's Social Studies. She announced de teachers tat'll be teaching us(406, 409, 410). For us, we had Jeffrey Aw(Geez) and a new male teacher(forgotten his name). Haiz!!!  In the afternoon, we played basketball(Chun Seng, Ron, Zhan Yuan n me a team) vs de NPCC team.. Lolx.. I tink we won(didn't really count the points) in de end. After which, ron came to my house to play RO  again . Haiz.. Today she didn't turn up at school today.. >_  P.S: Thanks to Kheng, i borrowed from him Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix! Yay~ ^^ P.S 2: Damned, it's thick.   Quote: In the end, we will conserve only what we love, we will love only what we understand, we will understand only what we are taught. Quote 2: Too often we give children answers to remember rather than problems to solve. Quote 3: Example isn't another way to teach, it is the only way to teach.
