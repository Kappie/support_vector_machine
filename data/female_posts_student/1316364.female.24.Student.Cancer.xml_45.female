I miss him and for some reason today sucks more then the rest of the days I have had to go through without him. He has been overseas for a month and a half and hasn’t been home since Christmas. It has just been too long for him to be gone. Today we decided to meet online for an afternoon, for me, very late evening, for him, date. It is so wonderful to be able to talk to him online, I seriously advise anyone in my situation to find out a working schedule of times to communicate with your loved one overseas via messenger services (Yahoo, MSN, AOL IM, etc.) It does help the days go by a little smoother.   Jesse told me that he got my box. I am so glad it got to him ok. I was worried. He said that the coffee I sent (two ½ pound bags of freshly ground Starbucks Coffee) smelled so good and the cookies (I baked M cookies) were delicious and to send more. This made my day. I am so glad that he got it and everything was fine. I can start on box number two now. Maybe this time I will bake him some special cookies.   This day started out so awful, but having Jesse to talk to while at work is helping lift my mood up. He always knows how to make me smile, even from ½ way across the world.
