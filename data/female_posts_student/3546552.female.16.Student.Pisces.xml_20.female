I got to pick out a bunch of new outfits and a new swimsuit for my trip to  Florida .  Which, by the way, starts this Thursday! I am so excited. So then, after shopping, I went to church for worship team and Choir practice after which was the service, where the little kids were amazingly cute and funny...Madeline you my dear, were the best of all! *wink wink* The rest of the service rocked, because  Mr. Headley ...yes MR!!! told a whole bunch of hilarious stories that made everybody laugh. We really felt the joy of the Lord! Kopps was fun after that, although the mosquitos were vicious (hmmm sp?) Then, finally, when I got home, I had the privaledge of talking to my M.R. and that just  MADE  my day! Luv ya M.R! So now it's off to dream land where I get to forget all my worries and cares...o wait, that's right, I don't have any! HAHA school is out for the summer, and I am ready to kick back and relax! Peace everybody!
