I can't make up my mind if it is Darcy I like more or Firth, it perplexes me, I think it is a bit of both of them. Ms Eliza Bennet is again one of my favorite female fictional characters, she belongs in an age where women only gossiped, knitted, made hats and fell in love, yet she stands out, she did all those things but her wit and intelligence stands her apart. I love the thing that goes on with her and Darcy, the way he creeps into her affections without her knowing.  Jane is too nice I think, I find that her objective of finding good in everyone is a little far fetched and thus I am inclined to think that she is not very smart. For some reason I like Mr. Collins. I love the way Austen has created him, full of false prestige. I think I am going to buy the book, I can't seem to find the copy I had as a child, so its time to get a new one.
