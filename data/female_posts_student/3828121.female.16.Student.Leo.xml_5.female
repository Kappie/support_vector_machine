I swear, if i had to hear about Detective Shadow or Sim Shady or Sam Spade one more time....ugh....and i lost too. and we know how sara gets when she loses, lol. no actually, i was good about it. for once.  but, i guess that's really it. nothing really happened after the game. watched cartoons. took him home. now i'm eating and writing this. and talking to him on teh internet. fun fun.
