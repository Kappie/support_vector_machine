(by that time, it was f-cking pouring.) and we were soaked... and that's when things started going downhill... [bruce] most likely likes [ethel], so i hate my life. yeah. not kidding. so that was my night... and then my brother picked me up. and his friends were in the car... and he was being an asshole cuz he was trying to be cool in front of them. he pulled the car over (on the effing hanlon), and pretended to be serious when he told me to walk the rest of the way home. but i didn't. and then he made me cry... i was pissed. aand theeeeen when i got home, i went on msn. and he went out again briefly, and then when he came home he hugged me and apologized. everything's coo now. minus the fact that my life is ruined.  funny quotes that happened tonight:  "i hate you. and then there was this one time..."-vanessa, imitating mike g. (long story.)  *random cat noises*-sylvia  k really there were so many more... really. but i'm tired/can't think.   wow i=suck big time at blogging.  ...and i'm spent.  just think of this and me as just a few of the many things to lay around and clutter up your shelves. kayte.
