A chance to be what we're not, be what we wanna be, and do what we wanna do without the fear of death in the way. We all know that the time draws closer each day but our minds always refuse to think what we don't want to think of. But what happens when it comes faster than our eyes can see..what can we expect? What if we die unsatisfied and have millions of regrets..what ifs what ifs. thats why im gona get high on weed in my death bed.. haha
