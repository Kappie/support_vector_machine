My initial thought when I saw the clump was that a dog had been digging nearby and left a nice pile of evidence behind. Upon closer inspection, I realized that the nest had endured its last day.  I went outside to examine the site more closely. It was really quite interesting. The grass of the nest was actually woven, almost like cloth, amongst the mud. This mud that glued the nest together for several months was obviously brought in bit by bit. I could see hundreds of small cylinder clumps of dirt. What a laborious task this must have been for the tiny birds. It made me sad to think that the structure was officially finished with its duties.  I spoke with my dad about the findings, as I had throughout the swallow observations. I've learned a lot about these birds from him in the past, and I learned something new tonight. He said that it was important for the nest to collapse. If it had stayed strong, parasitic creatures could have habitated in it, waiting for the parent birds next summer. Now, with a clean slate, or beam as the case may be, the swallows will be able to create a new, sturdy, safe place to raise their young. He also sounded positive that the birds will return during the next mating season. I look forward to that.  In the meantime, I think it's a shame that the process of rebuilding for the future requires a collapse of the past.
