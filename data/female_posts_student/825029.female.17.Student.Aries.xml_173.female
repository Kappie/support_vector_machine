I will never forget the awful food in Ireland and the amazing experiences in London!  And to top it off, Sara Beth and I were the best banner holders ever, if I do say so myself.  Check out my pictures  urlLink here!  ... I'll add more as soon as I scan the ones I took with my disposable.  After a slight setback in prom plans, I think we've finally got everything worked out, and I'm getting very excited!  We're going with Ross and Chelsea, Nick and Mal, and Michelle and her date, whoever that may be.  It will be so much fun!  Except I still don't have a dress yet... I think Becca and I are going on Friday (after getting our nails done!- Jesuit prom is Saturday) to look and hopefully hopefully hopefully I will find one that I like.  Charles took me to the zoo yesterday!  It was so much fun, and the weather was perfect.  Zoo pictures are up on Yahoo as well.  I fell asleep on the drive home and was awakened by Charles, saying "Melissa?  Are we supposed to be here?".  I look up to see we've somehow managed to make a complete circle around Dallas and were then driving straight through it.  No big deal, just took the scenic route home.  It sure made me laugh a lot : )  We met up with Ross, Chelsea, and Collin last night and saw "Starsky and Hutch" at Studio Movie Grille (very cool place and a very funny movie!).  So all in all, a good day!  My birthday is quickly approaching... everybody mark your calendars for Tuesday!  At last... I'll be able to see an R-rated movie legally without having to mess with sneaking in or running past employees (good times, Clayton).  That's all for now- I hope everyone has a good week!!  4-day weekend coming up... I think I'll start counting down the days.  Cool song alert!  "La Taberna del Buda" --- best Spanish oral ever.
