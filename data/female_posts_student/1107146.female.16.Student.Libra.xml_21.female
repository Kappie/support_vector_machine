I mean think about it.....the whole world believes that everyone has there place and if they leave it......here comes the tidal waves. Crossing social barriers in BHS is next to impossible without whispers and stares. Is this what they call America, the most welcome country? Everyone plays to the role untill that role is all they have, so they stick to that role through life then pass it to there children. Ugg why can't people be themselves. Why can't people NOT fit the mold for once?  Smile all, life's great.  oh and the interview went well
