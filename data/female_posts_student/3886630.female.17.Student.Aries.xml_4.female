I am a teenager and a Christian...or more precisely a Catholic. All I can really say is that I'm a normal everyday person. Well, at least I think I am or I'd like to think that. J/K. =P Anyway, I will write in this blog whenever I feel there is a need to. I'll have to say that I've had blog's before and I never seem to really use them. Also, I must say that I probably won't be writing in this blog after a couple of years. I'll be busy in my studies of wanting to become a nun, evangelist, or a missionary; which of them I don't know what I should choose of. So, with out further a due... Here's my blog with my inner thoughts and such! ^^
