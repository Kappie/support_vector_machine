(i dont give a crap what other ppl think so dont go and compliment me or tell me what you dont like about it, it suits me fine and performs its functions perfectly so that is all that matters) i also went through the endeavor of retrieving my car stereo and speakers from my old car which is in a wrecking yard or something in grand prairie... and then putting the stereo into my new car.  so that was an adventure, and im still not sure what to do about my speakers because the large ones dont fit, and the wire gauge is different so im not sure how to do it myself and i dont have any cash laying around to get them installed, especially with prom coming up.  well, it really doesnt matter because my speakers are just fine and all, its just the principle of the thing since i got them this christmas as a gift : /  well i hate school the most right now... it is such a waste of time.  band, sociology, independent study for calculus, and speech.  sigh.  the trip was AWESOME despite the no sleep and the sickage. so yeah it was great.  hmmmm Melissa Nieves is turning 17 on tuesday the 30th!!!!!!! WHOOOO that means we can go to rated R movies together!  ....more easily! so congratulations to the greatest person in the world and happy birthday!!!  i guess thats it... things are ok i guess. i dont know.  :)  ok so later!
