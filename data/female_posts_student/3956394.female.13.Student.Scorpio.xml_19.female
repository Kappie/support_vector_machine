What if i cant turn the dial thing on my locker? =P I dont know but im going to have to find out sooner or later.At least my next door neighbores go to the same high school as me so they can help me (Ones 1 year older then me and the other is 2) I hope im going to be in my friends classes.I will DIE without being in one class without at least one friend... And maybe a cute guy too =) Hehehe jk.I know i cant be stuffed in a locker because the teachers said we dont fit =P (We took a tour around the whole school before elementary school ended) But the lockers are big enough for all our school stuff.oOo And the main thing im wondering about... Does our school supply list and info come in the mail or what? Agth, at Elementary school they didnt give us too much information about this.. they think the kids can predict the furture or something.Walking past my elem. school to go to my high school will seem very very odd for me.Concidering my elem. school and high school are right next to eachother.. Infact, seperated only by 1 gate! =) Check out the gym for the high school.. P.E Will be fun.Same with drawma.My drawma teacher looks like Albert Instien or whatever =P White poofy hair.. freaky.The cafateria food is good.We tasted some when we took the tour.The schools big so i know im going to have trouble getting around =P In fact, the washrooms are clean too XD Very nice.The problem is the ppl... they all look freaky too me.VERY freaky.No one my size except one kid thats prob 2 cm smaller then me so called smurf.Anyways, im off now.Ill leave my thoughts like this...
