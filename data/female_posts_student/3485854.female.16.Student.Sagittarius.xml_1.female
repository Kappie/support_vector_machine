Anyway...now, I decided to include some of the similar info....OMG...is that Tabitha...somewhat following the crowd for once? lol. N E way..I'm dating this dude named Danny. This isn't the first time we've dated, but it is the longest. I'm dating him because he can make me laugh, he usually makes me feel special, and when I had no desire to be with one person, he worked so hard to bring me around. I could just Lay there in his embrace for an eternity, I love to be held. And he finds little things that are special. He writes songs for me and about me and isn't materialistic. We've had our little tid-fits, but have gotten through them and I think that they have brought us closer together.    Leah:    is a friend that has stuck close by my side, as I have tried to stick by hers. I hope she considers me a good of friend as I consider I consider her. We are supposed to get an apartment together when we're 18.     Scott:    is a new edition to our "clan." We're corrupting him incredibly so. What can I say, anyone who hangs out with us are in jeopardy of having their mind altered to think outside the box. I have other friends that may be mentioned later, but...that's for another time.    Joke for Today    There was a young white couple who had just recently gotten married and had waited to have sex untilt they were married. Well, the wife told her husband at their hotel that she didn't want to get pregnant yet. So she told him to go buy a condom at a little store not within short walking distance While she anxiously waited with all of the lights off.  When He finally arrived at the store he realized that he only had 20 cents on him. the cashier was showing him condoms. He said the white one was 15 cents, a black one which was better in quality was 20 cents, and the best one was purple but it was 25 cents. well, he took the black one.  While the husband was gone a black thief got into the hotel. Excitedly, the new wife thought it was her husband and grabbed hold of him and started screwing him quite wildly. She had worn herslef out and turned over and went to sleep.  Her husband soon came home and jumped on her, mounting her, and vigorously started to make love to her. The wife was surprised as she was worn out and thoroughly pleased. A nine months later, they had a black baby boy. When they boy got older the boy asked his father why he was black while his father was white. The father replied, "you better feel damn lucky! 5 cents more and you would have been purple!!!!" Well, I may write more tonight or tomorrow, for now I have to go put my bed together and do some cleaning then plan for my trip to Elkart, Indiana. I'm driving up and mom's driving back. 7 and a half both ways...15hrs total!!! I'll visit your sites before I get off though.  By the way, who in the hell is Holy Kitsune or whatever it was? just so that if I reply I know who I'm talking to.     Today's Quote    He who stands on toilet is high on pot!
