Thank heavens they (my dad andpuppy) areboth okay. My dad is in hospital, seatbelt sore, and my dog face-ploughed the dash board, and they're both in shock, but I think otherwise they're both okay, at least according to what my mum said on the phone yesterday. This is so hard, being on exchange and finding out something like this has happened at home! Man...I'm so worried now that something else is going to happen. Well, I can say it did, Paul e-mailed today to tell me that a girl I know and like has been relocated from fostercare because her foster parents were abusing her or something like this. *growls* It makes me so angry! Why can't people just treat each other like human beings; we all have feelings. We all laugh, and cry, and feel pain...no matter how different we look, we're all deep down, still the same species.    On a brighter note, I'm having a great time here. Yesterday I got invited by Matt (south-african dude) to go to a club in Coastão de Santina (sp?) and me and Maju were going to go, but then some stuff happened, so they decided it was too late to drive the 30mins out there. :(Me, her, Carlos, and Vito drove around, Carlos hunting down looking for prostitutes/drag queensso he could take a picture for me....*eyeroll* He actually succeeded too.   LOL, Carlos: "Heeeere bitches....heeeere bitches....bitchy bitchy bitches..."    Then we went out to Lagoa de Conceição at 12:30am before blowing a tire on the way back. That was fun. Then we were going to another girl's house to watch a movie. Made it home and hour and a half late after curfew....(at 3:30am) Today, we all went on a boat ride in Lagoa to this restaurant (which you could only reach by boat) it was beautiful, fun, but very cold! And windy! Got home from the restaurant, and Maju, Gabby and I went to a Festa de Junina party, but left early because it wasn't that good. I saw Nathen there (exchange student) I meant to go talk to him more, but he disappeared....we walked home (after eating a hot dog, with corn, peas, onions and tomatoe stuff...@_@ but good...) We (Maju, Gabby and I) watched 'My Boss' Daughter (I typed an e-mail to Paul at the same time) and then we went to Carlos' birthday party.    Pretty good in the perspective....but I'm still worried about home. Well, I shall soon see I guess. It's my birthday on Monday, we're going to have a big party at the club near where I live (Mecena?? I think that's what it's called) If anyone's near there, drop by! We're going to have a little party at the appartment too...carlos says he's going to make me a cake. ^_^ I'm happy...and they're going to teach me how to make these really good chocolaty things, which I'm going to make back home.    I'm going to have to find a place to put some of my pictures....    Tcahu  -Hannah  ps. everyone, please, please stay safe.
