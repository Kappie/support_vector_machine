We even had a real bum show up. Aka. Monty. I was soo tired today! I got 5 hrs sleep-which is a surprise, yet still when i got home, i had a shower, then slept from 10:30-5pm. Beth and Luke stayed up all night talking-until Luke had to go to rowing in the morning. What the hell could they've been talking about for so long at that time? Weird, weird people. N e ways, we think there may be a  relationship developing  between  Anika and Westy  (!?) -or was that just me? Excellent... Yeh so last night, we watched a documentary 'bout bums, ate lots of junk food and watched ultimate chick-flick, Sweet Home Alabama. Everyone was fighting over the couches all night as Luke and Beth shared a couch for the majority of the night and did   SOMETHING   under the blankets. (lol) We're on to you two.. I wish i wore my  uggies  in my sleeping bag-i had frozen toes this morning, it was nearly as bad as camp. I was soo surprised about the turn out. I thought heaps of people from church were coming. Altogether there was probably only like 18 people, then half of them wern't sleeping in the factory or had to go home. Next year, we sooo should go to  Toronga zoo  (not that i dont like ur factory, luke), imagine sleeping next to the gorilla or lion enclosure! Or in the reptile walkway. Or that part where it is like a glass walkway under water, so you wake up in the middle of the night to see a shark above you. Whoa! Mad.Well, i gotta go read other people's blogs.Tata-CM  PS. Did anyone actually get sponsers? I only got 2! I feel bad for having fun last night. Imagine bums out there who have to sleep in the freezing cold everynight-with not even a sleeping bag. That'd suck bigtime. Maybe that is why there are so many bums in California, the warmth.
