Anyhew, they are eight week old  Golden Retriever/ Lab  mix puppies, a boy and a girl, and extremely friendly, playful, etc. At the moment, they are sleeping so I get a break, which is good seeing as Nick and I stayed up until 3 last night haggling over their names and watching episodes from the first season of Gilmore Girls on DVD.   I guess this makes up for the fact that I did not get to go to Florida after all, seeing as Ms. Beverly is still not feeling so well. I'm still going to Texas on Sunday, and really wish that I could bring the puppies with me, seeing as Nick doesn't really seem to care about them that much. However, I will have a 4 year old and 11 month old to look after, so the puppies will have to wait til I get home.   I missed an appointment with nice psychologist lady today...  grr ... Mom told them I am out of the country and told me not to pick up the phone anymore haha.   Nick and I still haven't decided on names yet for the dogs. We've settled on Luke and Lorelai, but Cody and Cassie are still cute names. Nick kept wanting Shrek and Fiona- I refuse to name such a cute puppy after an ogre.  Won't do it . He also tried "Hercules."  Oy.    Morgan got to sing for Kallen Esperian today. I'm jealous. My voice has disappeared to some foreign place and will probably never return again. Perhaps it travelled to Australia.. oooo ...I want to run away to there...  who's with me?  Mike's sister went to a rave and told me I should go to one... HAHAHA.   If anyone can think of a cute pair of names, please post them. Oh and you are more than welcome to come out and see them in the next few days, should you wish.   Today is the first anniversary of the microburst that occurred last year. It is also Madame Quinn's birthday.  Bonne anniversaire, Madame!    Any word on Saturday, kids? :) Please please please!!! Kate Camille saw Brad....  oooo ...
