The polls shot up for Bush after his interview about the war.  And why?  Why does he continue to get away with this?  He needs to be held accountable.  I don't know that the man is stupid, but I do think he is willfully ignorant in some specific ways.  Prior to his Presidency, I don't think he gave a damn about the rest of the world.  He shares this attitude with the American public at large, perhaps, but it's a heck of a thing in a President.  World events have forced him to look abroad, but there still seems to be an underlying attitude that ignorance is preferable, even admirable.  The man embarasses me.  He blatantly lies as a routine matter of policy, and we let him get away with it.
