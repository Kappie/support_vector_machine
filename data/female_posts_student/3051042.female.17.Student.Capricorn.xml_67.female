Well, I started that process where impulses are sent to synaptic nerves in my head... I believe it's called thinking. Let me light some candles before I start writing about this. Ok. So I starting thinking about why we broke up, and I do believe a lot of convincing of the need to be alone was done by Donald. Not to make excuses because  I  was the one that broke up with him. But Donald played a part in it. And that tears a chunk out of me because I love Donald to death but I also just feel sort of... really fucking lonely. "I'll take you out and make sure you're not alone." I actually got that from two people, but at least Nick was telling the truth. I look back on the relationship that Allen and I had, and I realize how many problems we had, but I also realize that during about the first year or so I was completely in love. I just don't understand how things faded. And don't get me wrong, I'm not going to deny that I get jealous when I hear shit from people about him. Such as the night that Chris went to the Comedy Club and saw him there with his cousin. Ironic, my cousin sees Allen hanging out with his cousin... whatever. At any rate. I'm constantly looking for excitement now. I'm addicted to a wicked cocktail of adrenaline and caffeine. *takes a sip of her red bull* lol. Perhaps it's that addiction that fuels the reason that I go to Flint so often, or why I'm always everywhere, always with someone. But then again, I'm scared of being alone and that's why I'm always with some, or why I've been socializing so much more.  As for today, you may ask why I'm not in class. I decided to fake some abdominal pains so I could come home... and be alone. I got stopped by Rex this morning, walking down to the lower lot with Tiki and Gareth (I think I'm going to make a nickname for him... G-Dog? Captain Inexperienced? something...). Rex threatened me. He asked for passes, said we didn't have any. Said we were getting out of RCTC, said we had Dual Enrollment. None of that shit worked. So then he said something along the lines of, "You know I'm going to check, right?" then under his breath mumbled, to me, "If you take these students off campus you won't be driving any longer." Empty threat, considering the fact he has no judicial authority. He may be school security, but he's not police enforcement. I unfortunately didn't see him when I actually left. I wanted to paper cut him to death with my out of building pass.  So I've got medication now. Go me. I have an appointment on Wednesday. My test results get back on Friday? Saturday? They said 3 days. Then I go in for more testing and radiology. Getting my blood drawn... blah blah blah. They act like I'm going to die or something. If I die, it will be by my own will and sword.  I don't know what this weekend holds. April wants me to come to Kettering with her and Mike. I might drive up on my own. I have the band concert tomorrow. Sound check from 7:30am to 11-something am. Then I get to load equipment for percussion and skip more class. Fuck you Rex.  Damn... I write too much. I love to write though, so it's all good.
