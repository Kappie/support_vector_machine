These are the people who are weak willed and rebel and dont understand right and wron and when a joke isnt actually funny any more and when they have taken things to far *not talking about certain people inparticlur, honest*. I had such a good time yesterday. I am really glad i came out cos i wasnt gonna. Its a shame i had to leave just before 5 but then i wudnt have had a brill nite last nite. We went walking on the Mendips and it was soo cool. There were 8 of us, me, mike, steve, ross, ian bell, james rogers, reese owen and *dont no his his first name* crosby!  We were at the sqdn choosing groups and i got shoved in the group with the little brats, but credit where its due, mike did try to save me from them but mr bloody fat bastard satcey wouldnt have that. So we went walking and then we got back to the mini bus and found out that ross and the two little ones in his group had got lost in the woods, so mr stacey and mr trenchard had to go find them  while me, mike and steve and the rest sat in the minibus *me, mike and steve were eating my strawberry laces!*. but it was a good nite. would have been better without the brats but hopefully ext time i'll get put into a good group! This morning has not been soo good. My is snapped at me when i told her she should get up cos otherwise she was going t obe late, then a huge arguement erupted that ended with me slamming my bedroom door on her and then sitting down cos i felt faint and being told off for doing so and then falling up my ladder getting onto my bed. I have been sat in misery most of the morning and i have noone to talk to cos everyone has gone on holiday, so this weekend and all next week is gonna be so boring. i will keep postnig to let u no what happens in nailsea while ur off on ur jolly at glastonbury!
