I mean, a few minutes ago I was crying, wtf is wrong with me? I still feel upset... but I think I realise that the cause is most likely hormones. Chris and Lauren at party in the park were simply triggers (I know when Lauren reads this she'll point out she didn't do anything, which is true. I'm just putting it this way because it's sooo much simpler for me to explain). So I'm going to sit here feeling sory for myself, everyone can just ignore me because it's probably my own stupid paranoid hormonal fault I'm like this. Bye again ~Hannie xxx
