I have this strange rash slowly taking over my hands and forarms. It itches in some places where it tingles in others (mostly my fingertips). My mom said I had it on my sides and my stomach as well but I really can’t see it there. On top of that I also have tons of little sores in my mouth, on my tongue and in my throat. My Dr. thinks I have a viral infection which is causing the sores in my moth to form (I have been performing religious saltwater washes and now have moved to cleaning my mouth with mouthwash because the salt is burning now). It is hard to eat anything so I have decided Jell-o is probably the way to go from now on. I have a walk-in appointment in the morning so maybe my Dr. will be able to help me with a solution for relief at least. Why do these things happen to me when Jesse is away? I feel so helpless at times and I know if Jesse was home he could make me feel better. I just feel like a mutant with this rash and sores in my mouth, it is actually very depressing to me. I was supposed to go out to church this morning for a special mass for my Nana but my mom advised me not to because I might be contagious and she didn’t want me to give it to anyone pregnant or such. She promised me that when I was better we would go to the cemetery to visit Nana, which was what they were going to do after the service. I wanted to be there for her and to help her in case she got upset. Then afterwards she was going to go out for lunch with Michael (my big Brother) and Candace (his GF/my best friend) and Candace’s Mom Denise. I was invited to go along but mom also doesn’t think that would be a good idea… I don’t think I should go because I might not get to eat anything, not because I might get someone sick. I just feel so alienated. Angela (my Big Sister) thinks I might have Mono, but I don’t really know. All I know is that I am depressed today and I want to lie around and cry. Hold on to my Jesse bear and cry.  I hate feeling so helpless.
