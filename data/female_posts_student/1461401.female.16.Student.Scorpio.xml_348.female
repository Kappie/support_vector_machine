It was actually created by Margaret Cho, and it's called the "fuck it" diet. You see, what you do, is when you're confronted with something with a lot of fat, or a lot of carbs, you have to go deep inside yourself for a moment and think...  Fuck it  And eat it. This should be repeated about six times a day, and goes well with the "fuck that shit" exercise program. I'm sure you can figure that one out for yourself.    ASS MASTER!!!!
