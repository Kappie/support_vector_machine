So, my 'aunt' Susan who's a really good friend of my mom's and her husband John came over. I knew they were coming tomorrow night, but they came tonight too! It's weird. I went down and answered the door and...there they were! Hah! Good times.   I feel kind of bad. My brother wants to open all his presents tonight, but I refuse. I just can't open all my presents on Christmas Eve. It's just...not right. So, he'll just have to live with it!  I'm kind of missing my family too. This is only my second Christmas ever at home. I guess I'm just not quite used to it yet. It's hard for me to get in the Christmas spirit when I'm not at my Grandma's with that silly little Santa Claus night light she used to have in her bathroom and just stupid things like that. It's hard to believe it's already been over a year since my grandma died. I don't know. It's tough for me. I really miss her, especially at christmas time. That's always when I went to stay with her and stuff. Plus, I miss seeing my cousins and stuff. I'm really going to try to enjoy myself though. It's just hard to change something you've been used to since you were born pretty much.   I think I'll go stand in the kitchen now. Maybe the food will finish faster if I cheer it on.
