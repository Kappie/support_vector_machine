My daddy comes in precisely 4 days. These last two school days need to come to a festinate end so that I can uphold this illusion of sanity, therefore preserving my plans for the weekend. I'm going to do something with Elisse and Joel and hopefully Dave. Dave's an absolute doll. I adore Dave.  This entry never really had a purpose anyway, so I've nothing against leaving you all now. Bubye!
