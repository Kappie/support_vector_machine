But there was no rain, so I'm glad I'm not swimming home. But the bad thing is adam never "contacted" me so I have no idea whats going on today. I need to talk with him. Grrrrowls.  Working on flash lots. It's kinda fun. I might do a sad love story later, in much condensed form of my life. See how that goes. Back to the grind factory.  Emotionally retarded for life.
