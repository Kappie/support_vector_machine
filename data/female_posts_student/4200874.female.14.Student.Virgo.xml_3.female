(okay breathe in, breathe out). Can't get over it. When he placed tinkerbell on the slide... aaahhh. Tinks as he calls it. And when he sneezed while eating cereal. OH MY GOD. So adorable. I'm bodering on obsession here. But that's one of my weaknesses... cute little children. Especially little boys.    Anyhow, the show was HILARIOUS. I'm certainly gonna miss it. My saturday nights will now be a bore... (sigh). I hope they replace it with another reality series... comedy.. whatever... just as long  I like it. crap I know. Just hope it's NOTHING like that new show...  My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance.  Lame much! Disgusting!      As i expected, I didn't manage to complete what I had planned to. I managed to read King of the Castle, plus make some notes. Check. I did go through my G.E textbook. Check. What i DIDn'T do was my Biology  the G.E worksheet. BUMMER. Guess I'll have to do it tomorrow then.       Soccer. LIVERPOOL DIDN'T WIN. A freakin draw. How sucky. Geez... damn that Defoe of however you spell it. Owen the T-R-A-I-T-O-R! Oh well, they don't need him anyway. Good Riddence!! Just need more strikers. Better get some fast! Oh  I hope ManU  Chelsea get a draw as well today. If I'd pick one to win, it'll be ManU. Definitely.      Didn't touch anna karenina... kiss of the highlander instead. hehe.       Aarrgh... I'm on the verge of thinking that Justin is cocky! That friggin asshole may decide that he's done with Nsync. I mean WHAT THE HELL. Forgettin your roots much. He'd probably be nowhere near where he is now without Nsync. Just PRAY this is BuLL.       Oh well... sis bugging to use com AGAIN.      -Later Dayz...  Hopefully they're better than this -       What's a girl like me to do     When she don't get a thing from you     I wanna go where you're going to     Have to do what you have to do     What's a girl supposed to try     When all you do is criticise     Pretty soon you'll realise     I can see it, I can see it in a boy's eyes     see it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes
