Oh, thanks lauren for that little bit of happiness about how liz and ashley and mikel...yeah....lol it's just hes such a great guy and we're friend and if anyone ANYONE is gonna date that boy it's gonna be me! AHHH THE PANTHERS LOST!! AHHHH The whole CBS thing sucked because one, they didnt show any panther stuff, it was all for them damn yankees (just had to be somewhat surry county there...) two, they never showed the panther cheeleaders, im not saying i like to look at them, but i noticed it because they kept showing the Patriots cheerleaders and one got up in the camera with real yellow crooked teeth-go eat some more lobster bitch. LMAO ok. The game overall was a really good close game (cuz im sure u didnt see it..uh who wouldnt watch it?!) I ate WAY TOO much and i decided i wasnt going to eat a whole bunch, or just rather say, start a new diet at least this whole week, but i go and eat pizza and fries and a stupid chocolate cookie...eeeek. I'm going to walmart soon so maybe i'll spend all my lunch money so i cant eat this week at school HAHA My dad is coming out this weekend and im excited!! YAY!! The older i get the more i enjoy seeing my dad, at first it was like YAY hes coming out so i can go shopping (he'll buy me whatever i want..which is ok..well GREAT) but the older i get the less i think about materalistic things and i just focus on, wow...i get to see my daddy and i havent seen him since summer. He's 56 and hes been driving the 8 hour drive to see me and my brothers for the last 6 or 7 years. He even drove to Kansas once to get us and drive us back to TN. It was a 28 hour trip...not counting stops for food and sleep and stuff...it was the worest trip in the car ever, and it was even worse when we had to drive back to KS!!! The reason he drove out to get us and take us back to his house for the summer?? Cuz i threw a fit (i was maybe 9) and i wanted to see my dad and go back "home". Makes me really cherrish the time i get with my dad because i dont get to see him much, and one of these days hes not going to be able to drive that 8 hour trip whenever he wants. One day i'm going to have to drive that 8 hr trip (oh i know i'll take a friend lol) and see him. Oh well...i love him and im excited about him coming to visit!! YAY!! Lorne supposedly got home yesterday from california...big whoop. I dunno..i'll know how i really feel when i actually talk to him. Im doubtful actually. lol
