I think it was easier than past year papers, but found out tt i m quite careless when doing my a maths paper...

I actually pity the teachers. I think they are going to have a hard time marking my paper with all the ^arrows^ here n there. haha...  The hall is still as hot n stuff as usual, the extra fans the sch brought in didn't help much. haha. maybe i will bring my own fan the next time... but the gd news is that mr foo promised us to get large industrial fans for our end of year exam... though it isn't air con, but we should be contented lahz.. haha...
