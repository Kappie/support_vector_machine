I've been cleaning my room all day today. I dusted like one part of my room as well as the fan. Heh, I have so many trinkets in my room that I hate dusting cause it takes forever.  I took many books out of my bookcase. They were juvenile books. Now that I look at my newly recovated bookshelf, I need to start finding some good books and reading more. I like fantasy stories and romance. I kinda like Sweet Valley books, I only have a couple. I'm just a sap for romance. Lol. Also I read manga. I have collected all the SailorMoon and onegai! Teacher! and Chobits. I've started on Fruits Basket and Mahoromatic. My favorite writer lately has been Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. I love her outtake on vampries. She has such a great imagination. I smell food, but there is none. Are my sense playing tricks on me? *sigh* I'm so hungry. I'm going to be in the paper hopefully on being accepted to the Augusta Mall Fashin Board. I start my modeling training in July. I am so excited! Yay! Another volunteer job that I can add to my list. Mwa!
