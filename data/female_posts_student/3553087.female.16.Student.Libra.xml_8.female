Oh..I could leave this agony behind which is just what I'd do if I wanted to                     but I don't want to get over you cause I don't want to get over love I could listen to my therapist, pretend you don't exist, and not have to dream of what I dream of I could listen to all my friends and go out again and pretend it's enough or I could make a career of being blue I could dress in black and read Camus smoke clove cigarettes and drink vermouth like I was 17 that would be a scream but I don't want to get over you             -i don't want to get over you --------------------------------------------------------------------  Don't fall in love with me yet We only recently met True I'm in love with you but you might decide I'm a nut Give me a week or two to go absolutely cuckoo then, when you see your error, then, you can flee in terror like everybody else does I only tell you this cause I'm easy to get rid of but not if you fall in love Know now that I'm on the make and if you make a mistake my heart will certainly break I'll have to jump in a lake and all my friends will blame you There's no telling what they'll do It's only fair to tell you I'm absolutely cuckoo             - absolutely cuckoo
