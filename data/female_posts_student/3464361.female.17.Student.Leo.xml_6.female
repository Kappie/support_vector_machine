School is now officially out, and even thought I didn't perform EXCELLENTLY on my exams...I still did good overall in school, heehee! Emily is finally home sweet home now, aww it's so nice to have her back! =) Jamee came and visited in Victoria for a week, I only got to see her once, but it was still such a good time considering I haden't seen her for over 5 years...holy moly! Haha! Whistler was awesome let me tell you...as good as last year? I dunno last year was...haha well...awesome! But of course it was still the same as usual...ooodles of fun! The fireworks were cancelled for Canada because of some fire regulation...REGULATION SMEGULATION. Whoooo cares! Oh well... :( Granny was just here visiting too, I haven't seen her since we went over and saw her in the hospital, she is doing so much better I'm so proud of her! I can't wait to go to Kelowna at the end of the summer where they live...so hot there, so nice and relaxing before grade 12 starts, ewww!  Katie MADE me try bubble tea! Haha, I'm not a huge fan of the tapioca balls slithering up the straw and down the throat, but it was still quite yummy I guess? I wonder if Kyle liked it, or if maybe he was just being polite...hmmm! lol!  I'm now working harder than ever at McDonalds.YAY!Ha, I guess its' not that bad. I'm sure I'll start to hate it sooner or later, but for now I don't find it terrible!  AHHHHH! Already July 10? The summer is going to go by so fast it's so sad! My birthday however is in 18 days! YAY, 18 days until I turn the B-i-G  1-7. Lol. Ahh, only two more years until I'll be hitting up the bars and dance floors. Two years is wayyy too long. Road trip next summer to Alberta girls?! Fake I.D's this summer?! Hahaa! aww...well That's about all I have to say for now, I'll talk to ya'll later! .....Did I just say Ya'll?! Yuk! -------------m u a h. --------------
