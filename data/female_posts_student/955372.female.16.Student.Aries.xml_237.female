I was gonna say hi (cuz he walks the same way home we do) but i got nervous and chickened out. tomorrow. I will talk to him tomorrow. I'll be like "hi! kid!" he kinda looks like ben savage (corey from boy meets world) when he was like five or something. only he's not five, he's like ten. what an amazing little kid. He was carrying this poster board and it was like twice his size.
