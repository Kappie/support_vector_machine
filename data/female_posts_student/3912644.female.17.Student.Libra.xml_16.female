It was the most psychotic thing i have ever seen on a sunday night, it was absolutely nuts!  now to my problem: so theres this guy at work who's kinda cute, single, funny (omg forget funny, hilarious) has a great personality....blah blah blah, i could go on forever...so your probably thinking as him out, what's the problem with that situation?...well children he's a bit older than me.(ok more than a bit i think) and i don't think my parents would appreciate that/approve....sigh...so now what, any ideas? anyone? huh, huh, huh?? NEED ADVICE...MEL?
