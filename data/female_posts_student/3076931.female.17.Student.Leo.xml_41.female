The rest of the day I was just in a god awful mood.   So i went by and saw jeremy at work...it was frustrating because I couldn't talk to him that much and I couldn't even give him a hug or anything cuz he was working and he would get fired. and on top of that I wasn't having a good time there anyways so me and cynthia left at like 10.  And so of course me and jeremy were supposed to hang out today. guess who cancelled on me?? jeremy! Maybe that's the downfall of dating an older guy. He is just so damn busy with his work and school and shit. He works too much. He called me today and was like I just wanted you to know that you looked beautiful last night. I was like oookay how about lunch? And he's like yeah I have to go to Chattanooga for work, but I will take u out tomorrow..we'll see a movie. Damn jeremy. you suck. you really do suck. Maybe i'll just find someone else to take me out tonight...ha easier said than done.  my thoughts right now: fuck you, jeremy. fuck you.
