I didn't make it home last night until 9pm and tonight is not going to be much better! UGH! I supposed to be getting lots of sleep this week, but I don't seem able to do so.   I'm going to work from home tomorrow so that I can get everything arranged. Besides all of that I am having my adopted Grandpa over for dinner tomorrow night...Which is just adding to the confusion.   Oh well. At least being this busy is sort of keeping my mind of the race. HA! I can't stop thinking about the race.I am picking up new shoes tonight and going for a short run in them to break them in. Then no work out at all on Thurs. and Fri. I think Sat I'll go for a little swim and run just to calm down....But we'll see.   ONLY 4 Days left!
