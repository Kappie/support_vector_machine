One of the things that also annoyed me about the flight was that 'The Day After Tomorrow' was showing and we got some headphones so I could listen because I hadn't seen it before and really wanted to. The kind of headphones they game me though are not normal ones, they were the smaller ones you stick in your ears, and my ears are too small and those things are too big and they dont fit and constantly fall out because I cannot get them in properly in the first place. So I ended up not watching it and was very pissed off.      When we finally got of the plane we waited for a while to get the luggage, and then got back onto the shuttle bus to take us back round to the long term car park. Once we got there my Mum was joking about the car not starting again once we get in it after leaving it for a week. She cursed it. The car battery was dead to the world. Dad tried to get some help from some near by drivers, but they were in the exact same position but they had called the AA so we would wait for them to turn up and see if they would help us out even thought we arent members of the AA. Once he got there he did agree to help us out thankfully and gave us a jump start that would give us enough power to drive home. Dad slipped him a tenner for his help and he was happy.      I couldnt wait to see the cats again and sleep in my own bed!!! Even if it is uncomfy. All the cats were very crawly especially TC, Max and Tigger, who started mieowing if you stopped stroking him. lol. I aslo got a txt message when I got home from Saya saying that she was back from Japan but was a bit jet lagged and I couldn't wait to catch up with her.      Later I had a call from Kyra asking if I wanted to go swimming with her and the others, of couse I said yes, even though we have all known each other for 3 years but nver been swimming together, lol. SO we arranged to go swimming on Friday. Thats about it for that day.
