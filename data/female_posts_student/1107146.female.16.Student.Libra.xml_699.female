FUCK .  sometimes i just hate stuff. today was one of those days. you know the kind. the kind when you just wanna   SCREAM  until it hurts. the kind that you get when you're really fucking tired and you seem to find  EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THE WORLD IN A SINGLE SITTING. THAT  was today. i think it was just the repercussions of that other post i made a long ass time ago. i think it's the little pissed the fuck off side  TRYING TO MAKE A STAND BECAUSE HE IS PISSED THE FUCK OFF.  just now i read a really gay post some other blog made. it was about high school languages and why people take them. and of course they slammed  ALL OF THEM  but they slammed french and called all of the people in it gay. most of the time i would sit back and then reply with,  "hell fucking yeh i'm gay, and i wear my purple with pride, you stupid heteros."   but today was like  AAAAUGGGHHHH I HATE IT.  and so i sent an email that said:  FUCK THAT SHIT YOU FUCKING CROW TOKER I HOPE A BUS PRETENDS LIKE THEY DON'T SEE YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF A STREET.  BAAAAH.  Actually, this post is quite sardonic in nature. It's was just meant to catharthasize,  because I love it . I dunno. I have male periods like no other. It's that being half-girl thing going on. I want to set stuff on fire...I say myself, but when it really came down to it, I would take the gas and pour it all over someone's house and watch it BBUURRRRNNN. And laugh my fucking tail off. I HATE IT.  RAUGH I HATE IT. Nothing works! God, I think it's my stomach. It hurts everywhere now. And I hate talking about it with anyone because of how fucking whiny it sounds. There are people with worse problems than me, or that have better stuff to do with their time. BUT I JUST HATE IT. It makes me PISSED. I yell at everything, and I think nothing is sacred, and I stay up late dead because it hurts the fuck out of me, and every time I feel it I get MORE pissed off, and it causes me to say, I HATE IT, and then it gets me to being pissed again. Hence, the cycle. We would simply have to remove the stimulus of pain, but that won't ever fucking go away, so, I LOSE!   BAH! I'm defective! There's nothing that can be found wrong, I was just put together wrongly or something. FUCKING I HATE IT. GODS! And so I feel like shit and so I start getting pissed the fuck off, and I HATE IT. I'VE ALREADY SAID THIS! I'M BEING REDUNDANT! FUCK!  Hahahaha. And again, it's all sardonic, kids. I really don't want to go to school tomorrow, so I think I'm going to get out of it somehow. God knows we don't do shit in any of those classes anymore. Or at least, I've been forced into a position of being blasé because I have other things to THINK ABOUT. RRRAUGH I HATE I HATE I HATE IT.  Ok I'm done. If all of you would kindly just ignore this post, that would be cool. I couldn't go screaming with my dad today cuz mom's here busy whoring on the phone with Glenn. GOD!!!!! FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. I just don't think I could convey how pissed off I got today when I told her she was going the wrong way on the road, trying really hard to get her to stop and then she speeds past three places she could have turned in and got to the place where we were going, then she pulls in the wrong fucking parking lot, thinks we're supposed to get out, I tell her it's the wrong place, she just stares at me blank-like, and THEN FUCKING THEN she YELLED AT ME BECAUSE SHE WAS FUCKING ON THE FUCKING PHONE WITH GLENN, AND FUCKING TELLS ME TO SHUT UP!  OH GOOD LORD, MY HEAD JUST MIGHT SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST. I can hear her right now, and it makes me PISSED OFF. Right, like you couldn't tell. God, I seriously need to get away from all of you before this all seeps through and causes lots of problems. God knows it already is. It makes me WEAK AND STUPID, and if not that, it MAKES ME SAY DUMB STUFF AND I HATE IT.  I'm going to bed. What the fuck am I doing?
