Mark Owen's 1996 solo debut 'Green Man' was promesing and did good on the charts, but he never came up with a follow up and the world was soon under the spell of Robbie Williams.  Mark Owen wanted to find his 'own voice' and become a better songwriter before he would return to the record studio and that is what happened in 2003. Sometimes you have to wait a long time for something good and this is the case with Mark Owen's 2004 release 'In Your Own Time' is exactly that, something good.  This is britpop in its purest form, highly addictive and well produced. Mark as a singer has developed and he proves himself as a very capable songwriter. This is one of those albums where you push 'play' and just let it play from first to last track: This is easy going, well written music, where no particular song stands out as greater than the other.
