Well, I experienced something of the sorts last night and I feel really bizaare today....  11:00PM at Jennifer's house. Laying in bed watching tv, chit-chatting about nothing. We decided to go to bed and so we turned off the tv and Jennifer tried to turn on the lamp next to her bedside to set the alarm clock. The room was pitch black and when she tried to turn on the lamp next to her bedside, the lamp would not turn on.  She said, "Crap, the light bulb is out."  So she turned the overhead light on and made sure the lamp was plugged in, set the alarm and laid back down. I was laying there just thinking about work and a thousand other things when all of a sudden THE LAMP FLICKERED ON. I was like, What the hell? So, naively, I tell Jennifer to stop joking around and just turn on the light.  (The overhead was still on at this point).  She unplugged the lamp and we just layed there, thinking how weird was that.  3 minutes later.  We were settling in, saying goodnight and the lamped flicker again.  Difference this time is that the LAMP WAS COMPLETELY UNPLUGGED.  I am not kidding you - the lamp was unplugged. And power was going through it.  It flickered about 4 times and I got so freaked out that I sat directly up in bed, made Jennifer turn on the light and I just stared at the lamp.   Okay, keep in mind, I am compeltely freaked by things like this. Jen was calm, cool and collected and was like, "It's okay, Shelly. This stuff happens all the time. Watch this."  I am just looking at her like she's crazy at this point. She continues, yelling into the middle of blank air:   "Can you do it again? I am going to count to five and I want you to make the light blink." "1, 2, 3, 4, Blink!"  During the pause between 4  blink the unplugged lamp blinked twice.  And we both looked at each other like OMG.  She repeated...  "1, 2, 3, 4, Blink!" And once again the unplugged lamped flickered twice.   Now my brain can't really compute what happened last night. I have never truly believed in ghosts but last night I know something was in her bedroom making the UNPLUGGED lamp flicker on and off and Jennifer communicated openly with the uninvited guest. It was really really freaky. I couldn't go to sleep. I was terrified. So I made Jennifer talk to me until 3AM. I just layed there with my head barely uncovered peeking out to the closet and surrounding walls every so often.  Jennifer was cool and really managed to calm me incredibly but it was so weird. I just felt weird. And today I feel even more weird.   We nicknamed the ghost, Blinky.  Blinky blinky blinky. Don't think I am going to stay Jennifer's tonight. Eeeeeekkk!!! How weird. Patched a few paranormal links for peeps:    urlLink   Amy's got ghosts too.
