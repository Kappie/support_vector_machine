She reiterated that I should be prompt and that weve been through this once before.   I ended up angry and decided to pop the accelerator and overtake the slow moving car in front of me. Dorothy shut up and was shocked at what I did. When I calmed down she politely said "Can you try to drive normally, I would like to live long and have kids."    Neither of us apologized for the way we reacted to each other this afternoon. We did went on with our evening. I went rollerblading with her by Bayside Marina and later watched Oceans 11. I ended the evening giving her a goodnight kiss and she having a smile on her face.   (N) is next.
