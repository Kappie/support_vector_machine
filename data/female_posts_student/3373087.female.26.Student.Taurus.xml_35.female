It feels wierd to not have to go to the VMTH tomorrow b/c I don't have any inpatients. I was thinking I should get a camera so I can snap pics of my patients and keep an album.  Some of them (like Beanie) I end up taking care of for a long time and I get attached.  I don't want to forget any of them. I really do miss Beanie and I think about him periodically throughout the day.  I hope his owners follow through with the treatment--his skin is sloughing quickly and it probably looks horrible by now.  Do you think it's wierd to pray for animals?  I know that they don't go to Heaven, but I also know that God cares about each one.  Afterall, they are part of His creation too and He knows how they suffer too.
