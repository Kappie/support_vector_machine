Besides, it's a wonderfully deep blue, and I'm happy with the colour (which was what I originally wanted anyway before my mom had to come stick her nose in my business). My mom has been getting on my nerves in many ways-- mainly the fact that all I asked for was a new bookcase and love my room the way it is otherwise but she wants to do everything else to my poor room. Egh.   I'm feeling pretty good, but my voice is super funkifying. It's all blah. One can tell I haven't done any singing in a month... bleh!   Lastly, but absolutely not leastly, Shah peed on my English Bible-- the one I use most often in English. I don't know whether to throw it away. It's a good thing it wasn't my dearest Italian Bible that was given to me when I left, though, or else I'd have grey fur for sale!
