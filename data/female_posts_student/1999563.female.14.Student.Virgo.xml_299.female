It was a gladd museum but it had mroe than just glass. They had this awwweesome photography section where they gave you rice paper, caligraphy pens, and a clip board and you wrote poetry about how you felt about the art!! It was SO fun! I wrote much much poetry. Then they had this art place where you dre what you felt and everything. I am going to frame my art,i t turned out very good.  Then we took the ferry to downtown seattle and did about an hour of shopping. I got this cool balck and whie striped sweater thing and LIME green shiny purse at nordstrom!!! They are soo coool! Then we went to urban outfitters and I tried ona bunch of very cool clothes that all made me look hot but then I realized that they were playing a really horrible song in the back ground it went something like "I don't care about your personality, I just wanna *edited* you." it was sick so I decided I would psend my money else where, even though the clothes were nice, I can't support crap like that.   Tomorrow we are going shopping more then to my cousin, Chrystals apartment.  I think thats all... who knows!  The pizza guy is coming soon so I better jet!  Later days.... Laura
