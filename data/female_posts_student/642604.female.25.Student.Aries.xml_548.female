I think maybe it would've been okay had it been marketed as a love story and the shock value had been taken out of the whole scenario.  But if you think it looks good from the previews... DON'T GO SEE IT!  You will be so disappointed.  I'm not the only one...  "The Village... my opinion... DO NOT SEE IT!  I'm going to sleep now in hopes of forgeting it completely." - My away message  "yeah so the village kinda sucked.. off to bed... nuh night" - Nichole's away message  "The Village sucked my ass..." - Bret's away message
