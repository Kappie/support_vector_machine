We attended their offical moonpie and rc cola festival! haha yay. it was intresting. i saw some cute skaters guys though. its like back home theres never skater dudes anywhere, only a few at school..but i'd call them "prep skaters" cuz they dont look the skating part. lol WELL anyways, here skaters like i like em are all over the place. i better enjoy it while i can.   Everyone got home from Montreat yesterday. :D :D :D i havent talked to lauren yet, but hopefully soon. I talked to andrew..about stupid stuff...lol but i cant ask him ALL about camp cuz he sugarcoats everything and i dont want my quesions like "so did katie fight with anyone" repeated.   I talked to joe last nite about how i hate it when people copy me. such as kristen lambert. i was tellin him about how she copies me and stuff and he copies me too, but he wasnt my main focus. maybe i took care of him too. but he told me to "whoop her" ..what i like to say "kick her ass" but joes weird. i told him i was gonna kick his ass over something and he said "no u wouldnt, cuz then u wouldnt have danny" UGH. lol i said "what if i dont want danny??" and he said "well i guess i'll have to send him to the circus where someone wants him" and i said "aww poor danny. send him to the zoo, they dont starve animals." naw..i'll take him joe. hahaha  Ally only gets excited when shes about talk herself or ur talking to her about her. i hate that.   Ashley and i have become good friends this summer. Its weird..how to become better friends with someone when u arent home? lol we totally crack up. i love that girl. She told me she was seriously "honored" when i laughed at her jokes cuz i was the "queen of all things perverted and funny" hahaha got that right. ;) muhahaha  LAUREN UPDATE UR BLOG SO I KNOW AOBUT MONTREAT!!!! haha cant wait to talk to ya!  *much love and blueberry lotion*
