I am doing ok I guess, I am at school, "studying hard", well actually im not, i have a spare, and have finished my homework... I just got out of tag, and now I hear there will be a lock down next week at lunch, we had one in tag but i guess they want to try it in the real world, so to speak...incase we're not prepared for the real thing if it is ever to happen, but i guess its sort of a good thig, because if it ever happened and we didn't know what to do, we all could be dea and that wouldn't be cool...  We were also talking about schooling, and how next week on fridays we will be getting out 32 minutes later, so that 2:00pm instaed of 1:30, or we'll start school at 8:00am, instaed of 8:20, to make up for the lost time, because next year we're getting extra holidays, and we miss school time, so they want to keep us at school longer just so we can learn, and it could be a good thing in the long run, but bad as well, i'll have to get up early, and get ready faster, and try to have breakfast in the morning, which i rarely have cuz i got nt time...  Speaking of time, i lost my watch yesterday... i feel so naked without it, i went to check the date and time, so i could pu it on my project today, and i went through a withdrawl, it wasn't there, i took it off in Biology, so I could do my grasshopper disection, and put it in the breast pocket of my jacket, and did the disection...but when i went to put it on in my spare yesterday, and it wasn't there, so i walked around the school staring at the ground hoping to find it, but with no luck,then i figured, being me, brain dead and all, i must have put it in my back pack, or my purse...so i took everything out and searched, but still with no luck...so now i sit here, typing to you, watchless, and hoping someone turns it in to the office, where i left a discription of the watch, so they can call me if it turns up...  Any wayz as i totally side track from what i was saying... We may actually have longer school days, yawn...zzzzzzzz.... oops sorry fell asleep at the thought of more school ,and more math *screams in terror* not more math...i suck enough as it is...bit of course im me and am too stubborn to ask for help, because i will figure it out on my own, have done that with several things, what can't i do it with math class too?? LOL!!!  Biology was pretty basic today...It was a work block to finish up on any assignments...me and emily had to finish our dissection questions... That was a pretty fun dissection...come to think of it, I enjoy disecting things very much...my mom says i should be a veteranerian when i grow up (im 17 tho) because i have no problem cutting things open in order to see whats wrong... but hte things i look at are already dead, so im not sure how sewing them up after im done is gonna go over but i should be fine...  The dance last night was Awsome...I had soo much fun... I veen got to go on stage with elvis and dance (i was his hips.. :P), It was so cool being up on stage, having everyone look at you and say you looked awsome...and i even got their new cd, and one of elvis' scarfs (The bands name: The Timebenders) It was awsome... no to mention I had to do the famous elvis love pose, that was wicked... but i was told to do it in chris tuttles direction, he's and great guy and all, but i really don't understand how i truely ever had a big crush on him, and im glad im over him, but i do like someone else, and he smacked my ass at the dance, but don't worry, i got him back, but now i have to watch my back cuz he says he'ss get me today (dun dun dum) but im not worried... but im not sure if i should ask him out or not, cuz i don't want him to say no...  Shawn came to the dance, he snuck in the back and came drunk, it was hillarious... i ran up to him and tackled him, scared the living shit out of him...it was priceless, he was so far gone, you could easily smell it on his breathe, it was kind of obvious....but he acted sober so he got away with it....  I didn't get home till 10:00pm, an had a bath to get the make up off my face and the hairspray out of my hair... i wish i'd got pictures, it was priceless, I think im gonna dress up like that on haloween, so  get a picture of it at least... Damn my back hurts now, and my neck too, i really gotta pace myself at these dances, stop shakin it so hard (hee hee hee) But it was fun and i was good, so no worries... but i still ave to tell dave the thing andy told me to tell him, and the cookie dough (long story, i'll write it in my other blog later)but cookie dough was no where involved, its interesting...  Well i must be going  ~Love ya~  Later  Lil' Nicki
