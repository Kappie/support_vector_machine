It has some of his better quotes on the inside.  It was a lovely thought but it was inspired by guilt as much as anything. I don't want to be bought. Instead of bringing me presents that reek of remorse, how about treating me with more respect in the first place? I don't want sucking up. I'd rather have my apology. An apology made all the more meaningful by not being followed up with a repeat offense.  He does love me and I know he wants me, but whenever our lives get stressful and he feels like he's not getting enough attention all the vows go out the window. If he's feeling neglected the usual rules don't apply. Whatever he's done doesn't really count because after all it's my fault.  When he says things will be different he really believes it. He means it when he says it. But the same old poor coping skills and spiteful behavior always come back. He's always convinced that I'm doing the things that HE would do. Then he punishes me for it. The only trouble is, I haven't done anything wrong!  I want a man who is secure enough not to need to blame someone else for his failures or his mistakes. I want a man who has enough respect for me to be honest. Who knows right from and maintains those standards even when the society around him doesn't. I want someone who doesn't hold up higher standards for me than he does for himself. A man who doesn't make excuses when what's needed is an apology. I don't want someone who tries convince the world that he's perfect and despises me because I know he's not and because I'm not.  I want someone who has realistic expectations from a relationship, who's willing to be human and to let me be human. I want a man who who grew up with sisters and learned to respect women.  And if he doesn't exist then I'll do without.
