Did some shopping this morning. Got myself a...wait, two new pillows and two new pillowcases. Loves the color. It's baby blue with faded parquet texture. Just my thing. Didn't buy any holster yet. Maybe next mind, oops, next month. But planning the color combination right now. Damn, so sleepy right now.  Let's just get to the highlight of the day shall we? I need my beauty sleep. Anyway, I was rushing over to the cinema to see the new Harry Potter movie. Stood on me line, bothering me own business, when three ungrateful, spoiled, impolite, barbaric people just stand on the wrong side of the line. They were trying to swipe the line! Bloody barbarians they are. Nasty too. Got all steam up and decided to do all or nothing (with my dear cousin encouragement of course. Love you lass). Tap one on her shoulder, let her know there was only one line. Yes, ONE line u eedjit. One minute later, she was gone leaving her somewhat younger companion still on the WRONG side of the lane. Guess what? She came back dragging an awful looking thing I presummed her brother. And he, instead correcting her manner, stood on her previous post. I assumed they are siblings, you can see clearly from their manners and behaviour. Implecably rotten. Nasty rotten. Then my dear cousin (who was standing behind me) said that we should leave it to the boys (there's a man in front of me). She suggested that we should see if he (the man standing in front of me on the RIGHT lane) would up to the challenge. And bloody well, he wasn't! Then it all up to the ladies then. Almost on the edge of the lane, we tap him (the ungrateful lot) on the back and ask him to get in line. Yes, the RIGHT lane you eedjit. And like any other ungrateful lots, he refused and claimed that he got there before we do. How nice...rotten and a lying smug. They are definetely siblings. And apparantly badly need some bottlebottom glasses because he didn't see me there standing on the lane, before he did. Me! Me! The big girl with white shirt. Hello? Oh wait...he didn't have his glasses on. And his manner too. Damn those three ungrateful, rotten lots.  Anyway, there's me story on today's event. I'll be back tomorrow for the review on Harry Potter (who is turning out to be fine young lad. Watch out Orlando). Without the rage of course (thos damn ungrateful, rotten, impolite, barbaric eedjits).   Ps. If anyone feel offended, well...since I'm not in a very good mood...bugger off! Don't mind me post then.
