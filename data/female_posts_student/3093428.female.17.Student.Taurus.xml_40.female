You can't even imagine how hard that must have been for them...watching another team so happy, celebrating, and your going home empty handed. That must really hurt, like nothing ever before. CBC put on there annual playoff music video again and it was sooooooooooooo good! It was 100 Years by Five For Fighting and it was really good. Really brought out the emotions in hockey. I'm gonna have to show you guys...hockey fan or not, it was great!   The Great Thing About Sport Is That Theres A Winner.
