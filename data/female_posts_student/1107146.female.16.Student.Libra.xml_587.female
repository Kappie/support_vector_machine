Abby knows, and she thinks it it quite funny. It is quite funny, most of the time, because I end up kneeing him in the guts. I kicked him in the head once, it was awesome! And in the chest, which was cooler, because he made a really weird "uuuhhh" sound when he was deflating. It was BASS!  I went to play football with him because...well, think about it. I would have got to kick his ASS! It's too bad he wasn't there. O well...have to resort to popping him in the face with my backpack like I did when he said something mean last week. That was pretty cool, I think he bled a little. At least...I hope.   Don't worry , this situation is well within the span of my control.
