He's only called me like 3 fricking time this damn week. And tomarrow the day I was gonna spend with him chilling upstairs my mom's best friend from when she was 10 is coming. 2 adults. And 5 gotdamn children. I wont get any time to talk to Steven. What the hell's the point? I hate this gotdamn week! To make matters worse I saw A little princess...that movie made me cry when I did have a father that I loved, and it mad me think how bad I would feel if I lost him. Now I have. AND thanks to the TV...I have opened a wound. thatnk you..FOX FAMILY. GOD I HATE HATE HATE HATE this week!!!
