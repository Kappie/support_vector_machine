I made friends with them (elephant juice), I'm allowed to go to Leeds fest.  No news on the house, and Joss is going as of tomorrow (fingers crossed).  And Im happy.  I finished my work.  I played a game today hah yea im sad, where you have to name all the things you love.  I love my friends who tell me what is right instead of what I want to hear.  I love potential adventures and I love people who demand me to be my best because they know I can do better things than what I am doing.  Mainly, I love my friends... in a friendship way :P:P:P
