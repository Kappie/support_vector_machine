Not physical freedom, but emotionally yes. I was able to let go, be a different someone in heart. I was finally able to breathe. Finally able to say, "I care about this", and not think about Safee. Not think about the times where we were together, or the times where we had our moments, but the times where we were friends. I wanted it to last, and it did. People think it's completely over, but really we're not. We're still the same people when we were friends. I went to the park so I could just have some time alone. Everywhere I went just reminded me of how much fun we had. The pond, where we told that we loved each other, the rock we sat on alone, laughing at your crummy jokes, and the place where we ended it. Really, I was sad. I wanted to cry again, I kept it in. I told myself to be strong, as usual. And it worked. I said he moved on and I should to. That's when I realized, I already did. I just never found in my mind the place where I moved on. All I could find was how much I cared about him, how much I loved him..   Now, I feel different. Freedom. That's the word for it all. Freedom from the misery I was put through, but really it was experience. Experience I will never forget about. Bad memories, but great memories too...
