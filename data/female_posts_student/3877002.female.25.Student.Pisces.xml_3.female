Notes from the typing pool.....  Days away from my promotion (or so I hope) from the wacky world that is Administrative Assistance, a brief journey on the web revealed that secretaries don't just inspire stereotypes - they also inspire art! Just check out this  urlLink  clip  from a writer for the  urlLink Conan O'Brien show .  One would think that a promotion on the horizon would actually make me WANT to work but instead I've been spending even more time than usual on-line, fearful that a REAL job with REAL work involved will mean much less time spent catching up with Page Six and La Dolce Musto.      Hilary or Lindsay?    Mm, I was thinking it might be Hilary - she does have that new movie coming out next week about Cinderella and what not. And I have to give her a few extra points for the fact that her sister was in Napoleon Dynamite. But when I saw her on Jay Leno the other night she wasn't very funny and made a couple too many jokes about Jay being "old."  Sorry Miss Duff, but I'm just not feeling the old fart jokes from a sixteen-year old. Today's props go to Lindsay!
