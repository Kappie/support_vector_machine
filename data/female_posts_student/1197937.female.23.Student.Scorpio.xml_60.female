Now some of you may look down on such a life as this. but i say, let a man live his dream. sometimes when i look at Dale, standing tall behind the podium, ready to pounce on those tough problems, i see him as a football champ of sorts. one goad from the crowd, "hey lsat-man, do #3!!" and off he goes with mind-boggling speed, ploughing through passages, tackling the "could be false's" and "all of the following EXCEPT's," dodging the trap of extreme "always's" and "never's" to arrive at the finish line flushed with victory and answer choice X tucked safely under his arm. shoot, with such exhilarating mental stimulation, who needs espn?  work has been really slow for the past two weeks b/c of SARS. i realized that i can get pretty clingy during these downtimes. when i get a call for instance, i try to keep the caller on the phone as long as possible. no matter what it takes. i want to know about their concerns, their hopes, aspirations, life philosophies, you name it. no. i'm kidding. but seriously, i've been bored to my wits' end. and then, this afternoon, the penduluum (sp??) swung the other way. i was running around the office like a chicken w/ its head chopped off. everything was a blur, i felt like my arms and legs were flailing all over the place, my baby hairs escaped my hairband and stuck straight outta my head. it was madness i tell ya. and for some reason, when things get busy, it snowballs. the copier broke, the fax jammed up, the printer kept flashing "offline!!" man, my heart was racing even though i was completely caffeine free. and then the calls started coming in, calls which i had neither the time nor patience for. i swear i got a call from the slllllooooowwwweeeest taaaaaaaalker in the world. seriously, i was about to scream, "Lady, i have NO TIME for your verbal constipation!! c'mon c'mon out with it!!" but being laura the affable professional, i just nodded my head, as if she could see me at the other end of the line, and said "uh huh...well let me check on that for you...." eh. that's work life i guess. so by 5pm, i felt so battered i practically had to crawl outta the office. and just when i'm about to step onto the escalator, i see this beautiful yellow gerber daisy lying on the bridge between my building and the westin bonaventure, so on a whim, i walk outside and pick it up before it's blown away, and as i'm walking to my car, treasure in hand, i feel like the luckiest girl in the world.  me sleep now. g'nite you crazy kids.
