I worked so hard for what? for a car and for money to hold in the palm of my hands. after 8 months of working like crazy, I bought myself a brand new car. after having it for three nights, my mother whom i do call mom asked me if she could borrow the car to Cash Creek with her friends. I refused. we got into a big ass fight that night.   I remember exactly what she have said to me that night. "If you dont let me take your car out tonight, your not my daughter. pack up all your belongings and get the hell out of my site. Dont ever come back her and show your face at my door step ever again. dont call me mom."  I was hurt and i was devastated ... at the age of 21, I didn't know where to go. Why is she CO cruel. she never loved me like how she loved teeda and Tony. I've never talked back to her in any conditions. I gave her money whenever she asked. I'm so sure of myself that I was a very good daughter to her. but why was she treating me that way?   I never spoke of her or have i dear to step into her house. no matter how anyone treated me Istand strong. I cried a whole week. a few friends helped me out at the time. thank god for them. four months later, my mother called me to return home. now do you see how cruel and wicked she is? Just when I can actually let go, she pulled me back.   Today, three years later, that same routine return. I've got her message this morning which she left me a voice mail a couple of nights ago. the same shit with dont call me mom ever again. this is the second time you've done this to me. you're not my daughter, i found you in the trash can, i hate you. dont even bring your daughter to my house for me to baby sit ever again. dont ever step up to my house.   For those of you who came from a wealthy family dont know how much this really hurts. I've been crying for the past couple of hours. my eyes are swollen red. I dont feel like leaving the house to go anywhere. I'm so upset. how come life have to be so harsh on me like this?   My biological father left me when I was a couple of months old, my mother treat me like I'm not a daughter to her. What??? Am I an unlucky daughter which nobody wants or what? I have no one rite now. What can Alyssia do for me? NOTHING. she doesn't even know a thing. It seem like at this moment I'm all alone in this world. with no one to cheer me up. I feel so small.
