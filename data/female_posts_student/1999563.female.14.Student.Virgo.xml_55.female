Zane kept getting mad at Tony because there oppions greatly differ. Hahha... It was grand.  In science we just sat there. Well...we did something. I obviously wasn't paying attention though since I do not remember anything I "learned" The rest of school went on and on like that. Quite intertaining if I do say so myself. Wait....that doesn't make sense I just said it wasn't fun  *sigh* what shall I ever do with myself.  One FUNNNN thing happened! Well...WAIT! The thing in English was fun toooo. Oh goodness...my mom is making me SET the TABLEEE. The nerve. I shall have to finish my happy story later. Much love, Lauraaaaa
