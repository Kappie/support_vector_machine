It was quite depressing, but good nonetheless. And then, of course, Amy made me paranoid before I had to drive home... evil Amy. We discussed criminals posing as cops, people hiding under cars waiting for their victims, and people who have found ways of sneaking into the backseat of cars...  Anyway, my trip home wasn't too bad. I did encounter a couple of interesting things though, such as a dead deer and a blue flip flop.  So, for the most part, I'm as paranoid as can be and proud of it! ...  Oh, I've also been introduced to DDR (Dance Dance Revolution), a PS2 game, for which my cousin is famous for in our town. I'm pretty horrible, but hopefully I can improve. Hehe, my cousin says he lost 17.5 pounds from it, so maybe I can lose weight too! Well, either that or maybe I'm just being way too optimistoc today.  I had my senior picture taken today, although I'm not in the least photogenic, so I doubt it went very well.  *frowns*  Also!!!!  I almost forgot to mention that my relatives are here.  My uncle, grandmother, and two of my cousins are currently living at my house, so there's always someone home.  ^_^
