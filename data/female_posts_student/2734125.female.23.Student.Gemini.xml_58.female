I like it.  It is more comforting to me, more familiar then the same thing day in and out.  I would rather have this cycle of stress and speed and go and read and think and write, then the same and same and same.  In spring in school it is like the rivers of thought are flooding over- there is a vast fast moving flood of ideas swimming together where before there were neat tributary.  All this thought merges, becomes impossible to separate, and then there is your footing- gone.  However, when in the early summer these flood waters recede they leave a rich bottom, rich land that grows things, grows and combines ideas into new flowers that have never been seen before in the country of your mind.  This doesn't happen at the end of the fall semester- then it is colder and slow, and you are indoors, and its dark, so there is nothing to do but get you stuff done and curl up with a book and sleep... Not so when its all hot and light and ready to go!
