I have to take an 88 question final. Im soooo nervous. I know I could have studied more. Pray that I pass...   I cant believe how happy I am. I was talking to Drew last night about me and Mark and him and Kayla, and we couldn't even imagine to be this happy... ever. Mark makes me smile and laugh and gives me that warm and tingly feeling all over. People are probably thinking, a guy 2 years younger can do that to you? Yeah right... Well, yeah I am right. So, if you're gonna laugh or joke or you dont like it or you're jealous or you're just plain mean, shut the "h" up! *thanks Ted for that lovely little acronym*
