Stealing fireworks from a storage depot is foolishness. But using a welder's torch to cut through the wall of the building housing the fireworks -- that is extraordinary foolishness.   Several burglars pushed their luck to the brink of failure when they tried to pull off a heist of a building containing a large volume of fireworks. They used a cutting torch to slice through the main door, which was eight feet tall and reinforced with a solid inch of steel. Just as the torch penetrated the door, and success was at hand... a spark landed in a crate of fireworks near the door.   Fireworks are explosive, and this particular crate contained the equivalent of a hundred pounds of gunpowder. The entire factory exploded, and the door was popped from its hinges and slammed flat into the ground.   Astoundingly, the perpetrators were not killed, and have never been found. Flabbergasted pyrotechnics professionals have dubbed them the "Hole in the Ground Gang."   if that is not the MOST AMAZING thing you have ever heard...
