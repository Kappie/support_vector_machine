It all depends on how much someone wants something, no matter if you do or don't.   Today some guy asked me how I was and I was reminded of how dishonest we are when I, without even thinking about it, automatically answered, oh good. I had a miserable day. Why do we do that. And also, all those times when you cry, alone, for whatever reason, whether you're crying yourself to sleep, crying while driving, while just being alone, will anyone ever know about all those times? Do they matter to anyone but you? Will it, at the end of the day, just be another one of those things that you know you got through, and you know that it only can matter to you, becuase it's about you and no one else even needs to know?         Today marks the 9 month anniversary of His  death. Funny but the months don't mean anything to me. They just mark the passage of time, not pain or memory. I cried again today about him. I thought I was beginning to get over it, but today was a step in the other direction.
