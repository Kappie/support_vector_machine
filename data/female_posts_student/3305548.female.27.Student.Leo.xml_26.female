I think I am officially out of the post-mom's day doghouse. My mother managed not to corner me or pin me or be mean to me in any way...although she did try to wrangle my husband and I into working at her orchard.   "Troy" was not abominable in my opinion - although my fellow movie viewers thought so. It wasnt Oscar worthy by any stretch of the imagination and my husband put it best when he called it "A very expensive made for TV movie."   First some plot issues. They hit us over the head with the "story that will be told for centuries "per Achilles ego...a bit too much and a bit too hard. The parallels of relationships (Helen and Parris vs. Briseis and Achilles) were done a little too obviously. It was a bit painful at times...yes yes the audience understood the love that crosses cultures concept. One burning question my husband had...where did Cassandra go? She was apparently simply left out of this story. There were some story lines and moments that developed too quickly...and some that were over played and dragged out a bit too much. One element that wasnt hit on enough was the character of Odyseus. At the end of the movie my mother was like, "Oh he was Odyseus (played by Sean Bean aka: Boromir in Lord of the Rings I)...as in The Illiad and The Odyssey"....Hmmm and the whole movie was based on the Illiad - somehow I dont think that that was made clear. Plus, at the beginning it was very hard to keep track of people and places and the concepts of the story. They should have taken a little longer to clarify - it left my mom and her hubby in the dust and me wanting to see it again just to get it all straight. Thus the plot issues aspects of this review.  Next: Technical Filming issues. UG - The transistions an editting were terrible. From dark scenes to brighte middle of the day scenes then back again with no imbetween - leaving the audience wincing as their eyes were forced to adjust. There were toooooo many sweeping shots of ships, soldiers, architecture, soldiers, landscape, soldiers, destruction, soldiers....It was like a little kid playing with a new toy...they just dont know when to quit. The crowd scenes were beyond overblown...and thus lacked any sense of realism. And the major complaint all around? Too many extreme close up shots. We were either panning the broad scenery or just toooooo close to the characters to understand the scene for most of the movie. It was off-putting...this CLose Up overdose combined with what felt like cheap lighting made my husbands "Big Budget Made for TV Movie" scenario seem likely. It will however, be a great movie for Jr. High and High School Students to get a grasp on the story of the Illiad - even if Homer is rolling over in his grave.  The costuming was nice- the coloration of their costumes I question. Blue? I thought purple was the dye of the day...but I am not a historian so it could be acurate. It just struck me, thats all. There were some minor makeup issues...Helen only seemed to be wearing bottom eyeliner on one of her eyes in some scenes....and Agamemnon's scarred cheek seemed to vary in its intensity from time to time.  None of the acting was outstanding per se, but the best performance was delivered by the woman who played Briseis. None of us could find her listed in the credits....but there you have it. She stole the movie for the most part. (NOTE: according to my friend a fellow film buff, this actress would be Rose Byrne)  Other notable moments and thoughts: Achilles' (Played by Brad Pitt who wasnt nearly dirty enough in this movie to be attactive in the least...) cousin Patricus scarily resembled the oldest Hanson brother. Can we say MMM Bop? At one point in the movie Achilles is outside the gates of Troy screaming for Hector (Played by an unrecognizable Eric Bana....he did fairly well all in all and not a speck of green) and it sounded like Achilles might be losing his voice as he called for Hector again and again. My thought? "Oh, so this is the Trojan hoarse?" Orlando Bloom (as Parris) did another stint with a bow and arrow in this flick, deja vu. He was much hotter as an elf. Peter O'Toole was impressive in his role as King Priam, as well as in the blueness of his eyes. Hector's wife was well-done representing the women of the world who don't want to lose their soldier husbands...and she looked familiar although we couldnt place her name. (by Saffron Burrows -thanks to the same film buff birdie mentioned above- who you may recall from Circle of Friends (Eve) and Enigma)  So it seems I have knocked "Troy" some hard blows. Why do I say it wasnt attrocious despite all of the negative elements? Its a historic epic/drama. To me this genre serves a different purpose than the average fantasy/epic/etc. It is to spark interest in the subject, inform about the story line, remind people of the existence of great works of literature and times in history. It is to breathe life into dead works. "Troy" did achieve these goals. It could have been done better. The casting was amazing...and obviously there was alot of interest in the film and making the work. Its just a shame that the director seems to have been a techno-phile and let his cinematographer do his work for him.  I still didnt squirm through this movie...although I wasnt wrapped up in it...I think it had great potential...that was just not realized. Some things to laud about the movie: the Greeks and Trojans relationship and belief in the Gods was well handled. They were devout and doubting and believers and too trusting each in their own measures. The importance of the Gods in the lives of the people of that time was, I feel, well portrayed. To the people/characters written about in the Illiad and Odyssey the gods were real. The monsters were real. The world was a more fantastic place...so to the characters in this movie...the same held true. Although - I must note...for all of the talk of the Gods there was not a single sighting of them or usage of them in the movie as characters themselves. That might have been an interesting subplot. Ajax was a cool character to get a glance of with his great hammer of war :) The character of Parris was handled very well...a boy in love, growing up, showing cowardice, having a "great victory" against a great warrior (via arrows in the movie) and there is no one there to see him triumph.  The last burning question? Will there be a sequal? If there is (the Odyssey still remains to be re-told) I would like to see it. Even if it carries similar flaws. I had trouble with Mythology in school - I couldnt keep the people/charachters/gods/and stories straight. Seeing this style of movie is clarifying alot of what I only half grasped in high school and junior high - and is much more edifying and interesting than the dull claymation versions I was subjected to in my youth.  Edna Hamilton (see your high school Mythology primer if you want to know who Edna is) be damned, and Homer dust off your coffin - Mythology may yet have a come back.  --Mack
