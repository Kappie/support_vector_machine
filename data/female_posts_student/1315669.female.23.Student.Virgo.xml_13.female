Can't really recall when i fabricated this poem but I agaration feel that it's about the time when I was still in the midst of a broken heart. Solemn and nostalgic as it may sound but I like to share this poem here:  Realms of fire with silent flames, Burnts they incur seeps within. So much warth and excruciating pain,  screams get muffled and drown with cynic pain. Something endearing refuse to leave.. Shall it be deem a curse or a gift? as a battlalion of soldiers rage war within,  the land that holds them bleeds and pleads. Numb oh, is the soul intricate pieces of woven diamonds start to wall. blood calluses and spirit becomes worn, like an abandoned dynasty it stood.... Awaiting dawn.  I'm feeling that very familiar surge of emotions again. I hate it cos it makes me yearn for it..and because I'm so used to it. Its like a part of me, like another heart that is built within me. Sighz, nostalgia kills! I'm going to get a life other than this. Ok, I got to pack my stuff now... see ya guys in days...ciaoz
