I woke up, watched Judging Amy (I love that show...I'm a dork), cleaned the permanent marker off of my brother's car (people are such ass holes...), wrote some comments about Frankenstein in my "reading journal" (it's for school), started another book called The Shipping News, haven't gotten far enough into it to determine if I will like it or not, went to Bookman's, Target, and the movie theatre to buy a ticket for tonight and went on a walk with my brother and my two lovely dogs (I love them to death). My parents left for the weekend and my brother is currently cooking dinner :D and later I am going to a movie with Amber. Yay! I haven't seen her in so long and she's leaving for college in the middle of August. We are going to see The Village, I wishI hadn't read the review for it...it was really bad, but I really don't trust those things because I often disagree, it's a matter of taste and opinion really, but sometimes the movies  are  just pure crap and no one can deny it. Ah well, we'll see.  School starts August 23...I had kind of expected it to be a week later or so, they moved the date up...those bastards! *sigh* back to highschool, at least I'll be a senior. One more year. Hopefully I'll be able to handle it. I'm so worried about college applications. Am I ever going to write the essays? I have to get Northwestern's done by november 1st for early decision, and i know that's quite a few months away, but I have to take into consideration everything else I'll be doing. There are a few things I'll be looking forward to though, nothing to do with academics :P first of all the plays, for the fall play we are doing A Piece of My Heart, i think that's what it's called, about vietnam nurses, I'm excited, and because we had auditions last year because we were planning on doing it I already have my part, she'll probably have to hold auditions again for newcoming freshman and due to the fact that some people left. And also P.E.A.C.E. project :D yay, I'm so excited for that (for those of you who dont know it stands for Prevention, Education, and Creative Expression, it's a theater group against domestic violence and such) the crappy thing is that some really cool people graduated, so they won't be in it, and I don't do too well with new people, but maybe it will be different this year since I'm all drugged up now. (social anxiety and depression...) Anyways, I'm gonna go eat some foood, I'm hungry.  (and wow...now that you've read all that your IQ has actually decreased...I know, I have nothing intelligent to say, I just ramble on about shit that doesn't matter, but that's ok, because this blog is mine and I can say whatever the hell i want...so poo.)
