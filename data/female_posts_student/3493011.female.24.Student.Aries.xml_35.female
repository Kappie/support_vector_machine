My ex-hsemate used to do the "snapping of her uterus with a pair of scissors" action to signify the pain and discomfort that she dreads...urmmm..I kinda find that gross especially when accompanied with the snapping sounds "snip, snip"  Well well, Terence has gone to HK for 5days and will be back on Thurs.. can't wait for Thurs to come then we can chat for a longer peroid of time..but seriously, I find that our conversations are kinda meaningless... hmm... you know the lovey dovey stuff...maybe I am a wanker, I'll sometimes like to have intelluctually stimulating talks, exercising my brains abit here and there... No offence, baby... but I know myself is guilty of not initiating more serious talks... coz I juz want to listen to your voice...   *Sirens are blarring outside, muz be some serious crime bustdown or fire...Juz heard frm my fren who major in Criminology that my area is the hotbed for drugs!!!..hmmm until now, I don't feel anything scary, as a matter of fact, I feel safe here*  Deep down inside, I dread the end of next semester to come coz then I'll hav to pack up and leave... provided I get a sponsored job here in Melbourne... I really wanna stay to be with Terence but I don't know everything seems not to be pointing in that direction..I pray to God that please let me stay...I don't mind the cold winter weather as long as I can stay... I don't mind getting a shit job as long as I can stay... Please Lord, let me stay... I know I'll miss Terence like crazy.. I juz dread that day will come..I think I'll cry till my eyes poofed up to beyond description... even when Terence left for Singapore this hols, I juz can't contained my tears...   Sometimes, I suppose this is my own downfall...loving someone so deeply.. I get so attached to someone that my life can only function with the same beat of his heart... I hate to see myself as a parasite that clings so tightly to the one I love but maybe I am that parasite... itsy bitsy spider went up the water spock down came the rain and wash the spider off... Please don't flush me out...
