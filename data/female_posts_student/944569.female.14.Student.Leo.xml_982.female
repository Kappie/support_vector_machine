I'm seeing weird things,  The lamps in my room are bobbing up and down and my stuffed animals are waving.  Two cans with tennis balls inside tipped over and went up again on top of my desk.  Also, my Garfield figure is doing a weird version of the Hustle with its legs...I fell asleep and dreamed i was at school being chased by a gebbeth( or something that came from  The wizard of Earthsea  that was a dark, black blob) in the shape of Adam which kept on screaming, " I'm going to kill you!  I'm going to kill you".  I woke up again and fell asleep only to dream of being pulled under the snow by a sharp red thing with teeth.  For some reason, i had been testing ot my new blue wings that had grown the last hour and had swooped down too low to the nameless fear that grabbed me.  Everyone else at school was standing at the ledge and they didnt notcie me struggling for help.  I tried to scream but my voice came out as a whisper.  I tried again, but to no avail.  I died.  The last word that went through my head were "Idiots...".  It's true though. A nameless fear is the worst kind of fear.  So, from now on, i shall call my nameless fears Pink Socks or Adam.  lol. Today, i fell up the stairs many times.  It's weird to fall up the stairs but it was fun. XD
