As someone who actually has a radical queer agenda, it's odd to see something that seems so... establishment cause such a ruckus.  Of course, that's the point, isn't it.  For queer folks to remain the "other," you have to keep some sort of distinction between us and "regular" people.  Otherwise, we're just people.  Scary.  I just wish I could get married.  I wish I had to get a blood test before I could tie the knot.  I would welcome the responsibilities as much as the benefits.  The fact that I can't get married just drives me nuts.  If it is a good thing for the state to regulate something like marriage, then surely it is just as good for the state to regulate queer marriage as straight marriage.  I wonder what kind of an impact queer marriage would have on our community.  How would it change things if we could actually marry?  It would be interesting, a chance for those right wing folks who extoll the virtues of marriage to see if the institution itself does all the things they claim for it.   I've said before that we wouldn't get full marriage rights in this country until 2050.  In spite of all the hoopla, I don't think it's time for me to revise that estimate.  *sigh*
