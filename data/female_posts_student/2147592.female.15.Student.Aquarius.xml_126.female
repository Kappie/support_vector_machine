Yesterday when we were walking into Stratton, Nips, Tabby and Pig were all linking arms and skipping down the road, then Nips started singing: "We're off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of oz!" It was so funny! Then Nick Mills and Steve Mansell  started walking up and they shouted: Alrite Nips!" It was hilarious as he ran down the hill in embarrassment. Well i'm in science, and I'm going now...Love you xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
