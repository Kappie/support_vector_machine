It's just that I really want to talk to me. And you not daring to speak to me feels like you don't want to. And you not even daring to talk to me makes it even further away that we will ever meet, you know? And I am so ready for that. I feel like I could see you tomorrow. Cause you really are one of my best friends to me. Not just someone I talk to here. You are so real to me. I just want to make it even more real. Cause that's just showing how much I care about you! You mean so much to me! And I'm so sorry that I hurt you. But you hurt me to, even if you don't mean to. Just so you know.    Love you!
