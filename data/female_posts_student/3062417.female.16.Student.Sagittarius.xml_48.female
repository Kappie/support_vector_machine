I can take over next year and I will do as good as, if not better than (right), Erica. I'm shooting for any grade above a 90. I'm hoping its a 92 but I'm not going to get my hopes up like I did last year.  Well, right now I'm just listening to The Early November to calm me down but it's not completely working. I'll be off to go practice again in about 10 minutes.  Everyone Wish Me Luck! I'm Gonna Need It!
