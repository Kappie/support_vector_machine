Especially when you are young. And have to go through it again in like 50 years.  (If you're confused, it's this medication I'm on. Holy hell hot flashes are the worst thing ever.)  Anyways, Thursday is official camping day.  Yep yep excitement whoo hoooo.  Ahh I have nothing else to say. Just wanted to bitch about my hot flashes. That is all.  it's burnin' hot crazies...we're on fire.
