Thought I just type in my blog for you ppl to see how is part of my school life.  “I’m right dead boring here. There is nothing to do except writing in this piece of paper. F is rapidly talking about the ‘ang mo’ girls that help us in the school fun fair. E is reading a book by Nicholas Sparks, the Guardian.(that reminds me. She hasn’t lend me one of her books). Now F and E is talking bout some guy named J o W (my friend erase it after realizing this, so I don’t really remember who). I just knew that F doesn’t know St. Peter’s church is a Roman Catholic Church.( oh my goodness gracious me!) Now they are talking about the interact installation night and frendster (some sort of chatting program) Ok…. I’m basically reporting every conversation by F and E. Clothes is the theme of their conversation a minute ago. Ok. I’m still dead boring here. Just knew is already break. Jolly! Can eat my hot dog bun. A J ( she erased this also) is a prefect. Someone is so damn good looking – by E. E just squak like a duck. So loud. Here I’m am chewing my bun into bits and pieces. C and H are eating egg and meat bun. It looks bloody delicious!!!! Someone shave their head- by E. Woooo……. Shiny! Huh as if! E just squak again. A guy –by E- played the guitar, loves Hoobastank and one more thing I forgot. F loves hip hop, ballad and Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. E claimed that they are out of date. Then what is in of date? Who cares! I like Busted. E just yelled Ouch my ears. Should I call her Ai Lin. Nay, not nice. A little more about the great, brilliant magnificent me! No applause please! Thank you! Thank you! E just ask me to write this piece of crap throughout the whole year. ( this is where she realize I was actually writing what they were talking about and starting “editing the original manuscript”) Harry Potter rulez!!!!! I want the sixth book NOW!!!!!!! I doubt that it will even come out this year. So sad……so sad….. Next year got Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire movie. Five hours long….. Five long glorious hours….. Enough of HP. She squak again-I meant E- because of Van Diesel. Is he actually good looking???????? E is so mean. I want to cry. Joking….. joking….. Some annoying pig is pinching the stupid vermin bunny. ( the sound produced is like one of those small little kids shoes) F cannot accept the fact that E doesn’t want, I repeat, DOESN’E WANT an Astro. I think is normal. ( cause I myself doesn’t have one) G has a secret and F wants to know. Hmmmmm I wonder what it is…… anyway someone at the back just fell.”  The End of my school report.
