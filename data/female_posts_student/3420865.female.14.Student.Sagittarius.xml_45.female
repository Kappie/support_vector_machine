(i still have love for you, nessa baby. always.) ok so i forgot to tell my  biggest  news of my life.        I GOT MY BRACES OFF!        don't adjust your monitors folks, because you did indeed read that correctly. i am now brace-free, and (minus the metal wires running along the back of my teeth) metal-free. wednesday=getting my kickass retainer. it's pink and yellow (plaid pattern thing). yes. sweetness.      so nessa's birthday party on tuesday (tomorrow). it's going to be sa-weet.       and i'm going now...      i'll kiss your lips again.      kayte.
