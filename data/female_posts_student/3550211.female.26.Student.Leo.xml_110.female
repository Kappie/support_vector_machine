Perhaps even a paragraph or two. Anything more then that would, of course, be entirely way to much to ask. Obviously. The queen of procrastination here, can't even get a thesis statement. I don't understand what my problem is. I'm usually so motivated to write. Granted, writing term papers isn't exactly the most  exciting  task. But even still, I manage to incorporate my own creativity. My papers are always drenched in cynicism and dripping with sarcasm. And they're funny. Not funny in the sense you're going to burst out laughing (unless that was my intention) but funny in the dark comical satire way. I usually have no problem getting started on these type of assignments.   Except for now.   And my boss just dropped an abundance of work on my desk, and asked me in the most obnoxious and pretentious manner, if I would be so kind to do this "special project" for him. A question, which so obviously, could never be answered with a simple "NO."  Cut the shit I want to say. Just tell me what you want me to do. And I'll do it. I'll tip my hat, give a salute and somehow under my breath manage to muster a, "yes sir."
