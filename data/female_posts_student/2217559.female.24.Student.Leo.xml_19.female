I got the call from Caron Grant (my recruiter) on Friday afternoon at the airport curbside check-in at 5:01PM.  We played phone tag through security check points until I finally got to my terminal and was able to write down details. I leave November 22nd for Acapulco. I will be meeting my ship there as this particular cruise leaves on the 17th (which is when she initially wanted me to go). So, I got the news and called my mother, my grandmother, AJ and Lisa then Paddy. Wouldn't called Jen but I knew she was driving and I couldn't reach her on her cell. Then after those phone calls, reality started to sink - OMG, I am leaving in less than 14 days. Leaving, like packing up and leaving. I got home yesterday and started packing after a wonderful visit with my mom and Richard. I took a lot of things off the wall, actually did my dishes and began to get organized.  I wish I was inspector gadget or mary poppins so I could shrink things for my suitcase. I can't imagine not taking all of my clothes!!!!  Jen called me about 7:00 and I went to meet her at hoooooooters.  We drank some beer and then well went to anotherplace but we won't discuss that. It was fun nonetheless.   Tonight, I have a meeting with Tammy  Starnes to discuss the party in December. The party I will not be here to help host. Awwwww. How sad. They will do a great job I am sure. And when I get back we will show them how it really gets done. Hahahahahah. Just kidding.  But you know, I have been thinking about that a lot too.  6 weeks paid vacation is a long time. I am thinking I will rent a villa in Italy and invite all my close friends to come meet me there. Maybe I will take a language intensive course and learn Italian so I can communicate with the locals. How funnnnnn.  I am so excited about leaving. Nervous and sad but I know that my friends and family will be here when I get home.
