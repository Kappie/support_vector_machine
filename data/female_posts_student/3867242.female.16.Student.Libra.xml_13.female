It's almost 4:00 already and I feel like my day hasn't really started yet. In a few hours I'm going to take driving lessons. Watch out Meadville because I'm driving. Anyways I didn't clean my room today...because I didn't have enough energy to do it..or in other words I can't get off my lazy behind. I'll get to it tommorrow...after I come home from Erie to see Spider Man 2 (!) other than that nothing really exiciting going on. I don't work till' Thursday.  It's weird how last week I was working almost 5 days, and this week I'm working 2..but oh well. I can't wait till' this weekend because not only do I not work..but it's Townville Old Home Days. I know I'm doing a lot of repeats from my past postings..but my life isn't that interesting right now. It sucks that I don't have my linese and my friends are doing so many different things this summer. I guess it's better than sitting in school right now (eek!) This school year is going to suck because of the classes I'm taking and I have to start looking at colleges and take PSSAs, SATs, the SAMS test, as well as my driver linese's test (double eek!). I guess I can enjoy this semi-boring time in my life right now while I can..because it's going to be stressful in a few months!! See ya...
