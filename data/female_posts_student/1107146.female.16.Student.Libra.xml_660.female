The first one is a serious one, and the other one is a fake punk song making fun of all the other songs I've ever written, and myself for that matter. I need to go get the lyrics to that one and post them.  Slump  is just cool because of how Nirvana it sounds, not that it's anything special.  But I just thought I would say that because saying stuff is cool.
