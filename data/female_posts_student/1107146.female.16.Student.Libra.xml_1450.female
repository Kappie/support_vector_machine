"My mom is back in the hospital because her stupid doctor didn't put her on the right meds.  He was supposed to give her an anti-clotting medicine, but didn't, just a blood thinner.  she's now had a blood clot go up to her lungs and explode, meaning that she was within minutes of dying.  And still the stupid doctor would not give her clotting meds.	  Anyway, he finally admitted her to the hospital, but she's closer to dying now than ever.	  Oh, and I'm in Alaska, cause I forgot to tell them that."
