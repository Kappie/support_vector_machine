I was amazed at the amount of absolute teen trash there was. Some were treating the quizzes like a blog! I attempted to search for more specific quizzes, but that function has been disabled. Helpful. Perhaps browsing is the way to go. Nope, only lets you jump a maximum of 1000 quizzes, and with more than 500000 quizzes I wasn't going to click it 500 times.  Thankfully, Yahoo came through with the goods and I found some very good ones.   urlLink R u a sexy Microwave  is just insane, but funny.   urlLink Which Donnie Darko Character Are You  is a good one if you like the film.  And the best one I found....   urlLink The Villain Quiz  is worth doing to read the options alone. I couldn't stop laughing.  I, of course, am a Super Villain. Up there with the likes of Lex Luthor.
