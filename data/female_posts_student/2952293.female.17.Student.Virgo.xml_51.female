But that's when TBS came on and I sprinted away. Later I asked for them back and Erica had lost hers. At Stake n Shake I brought up the fact that Erica lost my sharpie, and to defend herself she yells, "Yeah, well Chelsea dropped hers in the toilet!" WHAT?!?!?! Yes, Chelsea dropped my sharpie in her piss and then wiped it off and gave it back. Thanks, I appreciate that.
