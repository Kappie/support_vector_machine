We went out for lunch today he *gasp* got a phone number. Provino's has excellent fetuccini. My brother has gone to the movies... or so he says. Uhh..... i haven't been horny in forever. I just feel kind of blah.... like nothing matters all of a sudden. I think im going to drop that AP History course..... too hard. I suppose i'll post back if there's something worth it.... but i doubt there will be......  i love no one.
