Some people  just CANT take it but they sure as hell can dish it out...First of all the dress rehearsal was just as much of a disaster as last night. Then i waited for Rachel to get ready so we could practice a part of the show and while I did that, Mr Blaise commented on how short my skirt was. I'm so sorry, I cant help that the stage is high above the ground. My bad, but noooooo, just say something really pervy in front of everyone to make me feel super grossed out and uncomfortable. And then please, everyone ignore me, especially one person who I feel like slapping in the face because they lied to me. Then please, keep on about my skirt, Kevin, that makes me super happy. I am never wearing that skirt in front of those people ever again if its so "slutty" and "permiscuous." And also, I wish if someone just didnt want anything to do with me anymore or had a problem with me, they'd just let me know instead of pretending nothing's up. Because that "uncomfortable phase" or whatever we decided to call that has been over. We talked about it and  everyone else  has gotten over it, so I dont even know what to think now when you flirt with and are nice to every one else, but you're a dick to me. Story of my life, right? I'm giving up right now at this very moment, and saying screw it because I am sick and tired of trying to make things work and always getting the shitty end of the deal.
