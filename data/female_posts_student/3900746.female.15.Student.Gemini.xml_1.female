The only disappointment I've had so far is that the site doesn't support uploading pictures. You have to use an outside account for storing pictures. PhotoBucket.com does just that but they're only accepting new accounts during a few hours in the afternoon so I'll have to hop online tommorow and set it up so I can add a profile pic to my blog among others. Anywho, I'll figure it all out. Well, its getting late, I better get off. I have to take a horse to the vet early in the mornin'. Poor thing. We spent $2,400 for this 4yr old whom I love ta death and named Alexander the Great ^_^, but yeah, he was sick when he got here, scrawny, bug eaten, headshy and halfdead. He was totally neglected. We had to spend a bunch of money in getting a rotten tooth removed from his mouth and now some of the bacterria from that thing made this big huge gross thing that ruptured under his neck. Anyway its WAY GROSS. Ick, ick, ick. We had to doctor it and drain it. I came like SOOOOO close to barfing my guts out from just the smell much less getting the puss on me. EWWWWWWWWW. Anywhoz, REAL NASTY SUBJECT sorry if I tramutized anyone. But we have to take him into the vets. At first we thought it might be strangles but after looking at it its not. Well gotta go. laterz.     If you want to see a pic of me go  here .
