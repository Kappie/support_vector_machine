Yes anyways, at first Val was pissed because people continually steal shit from her car...she has just lost her rear mud flap on her car so she has to go and get THAT replaced, yes....*shakes fist* stupid people stealing Val's shit!!  Anyways but before that of course i had wonderful summer school for the whole day...but you know what? i absolutly love my class to death! Yes i have the sweetest funniest guys in my class and i love them all! We just all sit and chil around...Yeah i ended up drawing all over one of the guys Sami's arm....at first i wrote "I love penis" but he started scribbling that out so i kept trying to write it...so he got to the point where he wrote in big letters "I DO NOT love penis" and i kept trying to take away the not....but yeah....being his body and all he kept pulling away making it difficult for me to scribble...but yeah so i used up a lot of energy from that class the whole day cause i was laughing the whole time...so i got INCREDIABLY exhausted after school....Sabz can verify that and say so....kinda got cranky too ...anyways yeah i was getting more pissed than every because i brought back the peat moss that i bought for my mom and returned it...then i went to the body shop and asked them if they have mud flaps to sell there and their like no you have to go back to the body shop so i was getting fustrated...and i dropped Sabz off at her house and she forgot her keys so yeah....i was also getting pissed cause i wasting gas too....driving back and forth...anyways so i droped her off and went to Canadian tire and it turns out that they don't have it so i had to go B ACK to sabz house to drop her off and again wastin gas but whatever...so then i went and headed off to Rob's....i didn't really wanna go because i was thinking that if i went then it would look like i went to see Richard...but i really wouldn't care if i did see him or not..i just want my baby fixed...so i went there....didnt' bother to go in the shop and i went into the office to look for Rob. So i was in the office and the secritery was paging him to come...but while i was waiting Richard walked out....but i thought it was a coincidence and that he just happend to walk out but he said that his buddies saw me and told him and he came out purposely to see me...so i was talking to him for a bit and i was ranting a little bit on him too cause of my car...but i dunno....i just looked at him and his sexy eyes and it just smiled...but anyways his dad came and we went out to check out my car and Richard came too....so we were outside talking for a little bit and then his dad(rob) went back in and called the company to give me a quote in the price....so while then i was outside talking to his son...same ol' flirting and everything...so yeah....we were talking and his dad finally came out to give me the price quote and he told me....and thne Richard started begging for money to eat lunch...poor kid....i feel so bad for him...he was working the whole day and when i got there...he's like, waht time is it? Noon? and i was like...omg...its 3 somthing darlin' and he's all surprised cause he's been workin all day...poor thing hasn't eaten a bite of anything...i felt so bad....i offered him the mints in my car though! but yeah....so i gave him a dime...which his dad found on the floor and gave it to me...lol so then his dad was leaving cause our conversation was done...and i was about to go and Richard wouldn't let me...he's like wait, stay for a bit and talk....so i stayed....ended up staying for like an hour and a bit....we were outside talkin and stuff....OH OH OH OH OH! something made me VERY happy about him though....he has a treasure chest line! he was for some odd reasons rubbing his tummy and lifted up his shirt but i didn't get a good look so i told him to show me again and he went all shy and wouldn't....so i stupidly agreed to something which i took back right away...cause he was telling me to show him mine, but i had a full body skirt so i couldn't cause i would be lifting up my skirt! anyways so yeah....i stupidly said "k lemme see yours and you can see under my skirt" but i QUICKLY took that back and he's like NO NO NO NO NO YOU ALREADY SAID IT!! but anyways yea....i finally got to see.....but yeah....so then he jokingly tried to lift up my skirt....not seriously....but yeah...he ended up pushing me against my car and pretending to lift it...then he kissed me *blush* and yeah...that was for a bit...then his stupid dad came out and told him to do stuff for him...and he had to leave so i gave him a hug good bye....but yeah....the secritary told him to do stuff before but he kinda ignored her...but yeah... but when we were outside he was like "so when you gunna go out with me?" and yeah...i didn't really answer him i was more like "I dunno" and twirled like a girly girl...but yeah....gave him a hug and he's like i'll call you...but yeah....when i first saw him he didn't full out say sorry for apologizing but he told me that he didn't have time to do anything at all cause he was working with his dad the whole weekend through...and the only time he had time for himself was when he was out with his sister who bought him to a male strip club lol....poor boy....but yeah....he was a cutie....but yeah i totally understood that he didn't call me....cause he didn't ahve time to call...which is totally fine...i wasn't asking for an explaination but it was nice of him to give me one anyways....so yeah....see....i think i'm falling for this kid...but i know a shouldn't....but i cna't help myself....his such a damn cutie!!! most gorgeous eyes in the freakin world!!!! i dunno....just thinkin about him makes me smile for sure:) i dunno...seems sorta like a playa to me....*shrugs* but he told me that after our date he went home and his ex girlfriend was waiting for him and she wanted to grab her stuff and leave...and yeah....i dunno....i'm smiling again....so he made my day....he definitly helped start my week off great! BLAH! boys!! them silly boys and their ways!!!! grrr!! awwww....*smiles* it doesn't even bother me anymore that he's a smoker....he still smells damn good after....he has the sexiest softest lips....*drool* but yeah...i dunno....the only thing i think bothers me about him is that he admits to being REALLY and Bad tempered...like his doctor even suggested him to go to anger management...i dunno...but yeah....he told me that he would never hit a girl or anything....and to a certain degree i do believe that.....but i think i'll truly believe that when i see it with my own eyes... to see him quick tempered and then then see waht he does...i dunno....argh....but he's so CUTE!!!
