First, we move to a town smaller and crappier than the old one. If we'd remained in Blenheim, I could probably still be working at No Frills (much as I hated it, 'twas money), and have my other summer job back at the Legion, that was cushy and nice. Buuut no, we had to move to freaking Tilbury, where job opportunities are incredibly slim if you're a student. Hell, if you're anybody. There are two grocery stores. I put my resume in at the one some time last month, and am giving in and trying the other tomorrow. I didn't want to work at Zehrs because it reminded me too much of No Frills, but at least with Zehrs there's a chance of me getting into the deli/produce/stock, a.k.a. something that doesn't require an extreme amount of dealing with the general public. Not that I'm  that  anti-social, it's just I had bad experiences working cash with No Frills.    There's a Tim Horton's. My friend Amy is working at one in Windsor, and advises against my doing the same, as it's extremely stressful and I've recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder of sorts.    There's a Shoppers' Drugmart. That was my first choice for a work place, because it seems fairly quiet in there most of the time. I mean, you're not exactly going to get Friday night rushes at a drug store.    Bah. I could go on listing the stores, but let me tell ya, there isn't a lot of opportunity. Along with the first grocery store and Shoppers', I dropped my resume off at Home Hardware. None of them have gotten back to me. I sent a resume to the library in Chatham when they were hiring, but got nothing back. Mother didn't even want me to bother applying there, because she didn't feel like driving me/driving with me. Which brings me back to my initial enraged question. I was on the Job Bank for Human Resources Canada, and there are a few jobs that I'm vaguely interested in, ie. I have the credentials they've posted and seem decent enough. But, they're in Chatham and Windsor, or even farther away, and Mom's not willing to drive me/drive with me (fucking G1) so I can get there.    I need money for college.    I need to work to get said money.    I cannot. Get. A. Freaking. Job. In. This. Crap. Hole. Of. A. Town.    Alright, I guess it's too soon to say that just yet. After all, I still have to put in my application form and resume at Zehrs tomorrow. But hell. If that doesn't work, I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.    Just to outline how badly I need money, consider the facts. In order to attend the college I really want to get into, the following fees apply for one year:    Residence: $5000  Tuition: $7475    So. That's $12, 475, right? Plus they mention an additional $3000-$4000 for "materials and access to specialized facilities" that students "can be expected to spend". Now, this is given that I even get into residence, as they choose who gets in by lottery, and there's room for only 354 students. When there are over 18,000 people at the campus, that just...doesn't seem to be good odds, even given that the majority of that 18,000 are going to be second and third year students who aren't permitted to apply for residence.    All right. So. I need a fuckload of money. But maybe you're thinking my mom was like responsible parents should be, and set aside a college fund. Welp. She did have one at one point. Now there's about $200 in it, last I heard. And Mom informed me today that she owes over $75,000 for assorted things. On my end, I had to spend around two grand on my laptop last summer because my brother fried the motherboard out of my desktop PC. Now there's about $175 left in my bank account, maybe less.    Given, there are loans, and scholarships, and financial help like that, but I'd still like to save up as much as I can by working. Plus I really need something to occupy myself with this summer, as I've mentioned already that Tilbury is a crap hole and if I spend many more weeks parked in front of the computer day in, day out,I'm going to bust a nerve.    ARG.   *pant, pant, soothing breathing* I know I need to go to college to get anywhere in life. Plus, going to college means being closer to Taylor, which is something I really think is going to be good for me, heh. For the both of us. He's looking at going to the same college I am, and to pay his way he's taking the next year and working one if not two jobs. Hell, if I could, I'd be doing the same, but I still have grade twelve to get through. Grade twelve in a whole new school, no less. Grade twelve in a whole new  Catholic  school, with uniforms and the whole shibang, not to mention being forced to take a religion course when I'm presently a pending Wiccan.   Feck. No wonder I'm starting therapy next week. x_x;;;  *eyes clock* Now where in the hell is Taylor... I need my pillow...
