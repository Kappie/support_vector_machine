All and all it was that bad.  But then again, that's because it wasn't too hard.  You see, today was "SPA day."  That's right, spa day, where three female attorney took all the female summer associates out to a spa,  urlLink Spa Mystique  to be precise.  I received the  urlLink sugar body polish  and a pedicure.  And since I like the female summer associates it was a surpisingly relaxing day.  Now, tomorrow is the real challenge.  The more I think about my work situation, the more optimistic I am.  I actually like most of the summers, the only people I really don't care for are Partners John, Patrick and Joe.    I wanted to call up MR. Vince tonight, and in fact, I was going to call him up, but then I realized I don't have his fucking number.  And that is a definite sign that he is not interested in me.  Sigh... that's too bad.  Time to target some other guy for a summer fling.  Unfortantely Mr. Shaheen is not really my type.
