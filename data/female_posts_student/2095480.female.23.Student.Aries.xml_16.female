The player on the other side is hidden from us. We know that his play is always fair, just, and patient. But also we know, to our cost, that he never overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance. ~Thomas Henry Huxley in   A Liberal Education    I talked to  Scott  today, and the topic of the conversation was "the past", meaning how do we learn from the past, what has our past (which includes our choices) made us who we are today. Overall, it was great. We also talked on matters of life, friends, us as individuals. I liked the above quote because it was just interesting.. and sort of on the topic of "past". I'm glad I have you for a friend Scott!   What else? NY LIFE called again today, Yipee, a job possibility.   I failed a German test... Big time failed. STRESS  Got a new book, this one on National Security... ugh, it better help me out with FSE. Speaking of which..went to a state dept. lecture here at VSU. Very interesting, and very invigorating. The State dept is of course, the sponsor of FSE.   And finally, talked to  Irene  and  Miranda  . Here's a shout-out to you both!  I have alot to do, so I'll write more tomorrow!  BYEEE.
