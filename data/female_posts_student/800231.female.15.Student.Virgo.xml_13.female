See, I go to THE most f'd up school in my district. They randomly decided last year that they were going to run on a completely different schedule then all the other public high schools. Hence, all middle and high schools but as run from 7:45 to 2:15 and have six class periods. We on the other hand run from 8:45 to 3:00 on Monday, Tuesday and Friday, and 8:45 to 2:30 on Wednesdays and Thursdays. That may not sound too bad but they also screwed with all the periods. We no longer have homeroom *whimpers* this means I have to actually do my homework at... home. Errgh.... Also for some incomprehensible reason, we don't have second period. This doesn't make any sense, our periods go 1 3 4 5 6... Why not just go in order? Why lose 2nd? Anyway, I'm rambling here. My school is stupid...  I have not done  anything  today. Nothing whatsoever and I'm proud. I'm going to school tomorrow though, Fridays are OK. I'm supposed to be doing geometry homework right now. I refuse, I'm failing math though or I was. My mentorship teacher couldn't believe I could be failing anything and promised to yell at my math teacher. I can't wait to see the outcome.  No one has tried to contact me today, I fell so unloved. My mummy is barely speaking to me to, what'd I ever do to these people?
