We are true. I love him because he is there for me, at my best, at my worst, no matter what I look like, no matter what I say... We get each other. We don't laugh when it's not funny, we make fun of each other... then we laugh. Because he's my best friend. Because there's nothing to be convinced of, it just is... and at the end of any day, that is all that matters. ;-)
