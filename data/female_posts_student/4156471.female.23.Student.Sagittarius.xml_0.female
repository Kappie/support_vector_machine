First we went to Masada, and since I"ve already been up  I opted to hike around instead.  IT was gruleing it was slippery, it was the least exciting of the 3 hikes.  The second hike was a quickie in ein gedi in wadi David.. to the pools and back.  Ein Gedi is paradise.  It's a national park in the hills next to the dead sea.  It hold hikes and fresh water pools.  IT's BEAUTIFUL!!! We were dropped off on the beach of the dead sea an thus we spend the night.  We pooled all our sleeping bags together in the parking lot and made a fire.  The bathrooms (5 shekel during the day ) were free at nice.  WE lay in the dust shared stories and gazed at stars.  VEry difficult to sleep, especially with the groups of bedouin boys blasting techno from their cars all night.  And heated arguments in arabic sounding off from al directions.   The sunrise over JOrdan and the dead sea was incredible.  And then we were ready to hike.   Back into Ein Gedi to wadi Avurot for a hike that stretched ffrrom 9-3!!!.  WE were dirty and dusty and sweaty and then every little bit there would be these cool fresh water pool, s oin we went.  IT was one of the best hikes ever..  half desert / hald tropical paradie , palm leaves and bammboo shoots overhead, mountain goats and ibexes running around.  It was brilliant.  and now i"m totall exhausted and ready to start my  third week of ulpan.
