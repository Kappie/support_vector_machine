She kept this pained face all the time like she just wanted to get outta there.  And then there's the crying.  I swear if I dont cry at least once a week at something on television there's something wrong.  Joan of Arcadia always works like a charm but it wasnt on for two weeks because of  March Madness .  This week it made up for the lack of crying by giving me at least two teary-eyed moments in the last half hour.    Sniffle.    So yeah, Camille... sorry sweetie, but Maui just aint big enough to keep you in the game.  Middle America is much larger which is why Johnny Redhead is still in the competition, and NOT even in the final three...  Sigh.  Time to watch Cheaper by the Dozen.  What?!  Sheesh.  It was either that or House of Sand and Fog and I wasnt in the mood to get depressed by a movie.  American Idol can be depressing enough, don'chathink?
