Stephenie, and Mia. well here is what happend... this guy, i dont know his name, but he told Mia's parents that he was the guy, Chester Bennington from LP. and he does not look a think like Chaz! and he claims that him and Mia have been 'havin it' and Mia is only 14! a year older then me! and she isnt and her parents (cuz of that)are taking away all of her LP stuff! OMG i couldnt believe it at first! it sucks, and that guy is lying and all, he is ruining Mia's life! well...she thinks i dont believe her and i do, i was just shocked yesterday. and now im talking to her sister. :sighs: i hope she is still my best (x3) friend. but anyways.. i didnt Email Toto yet.. im just kinda scared too, i mean, what if he finds a g/f in japan, or hawaii? im gonna be soo hurt.. very badly.. so when he gets back (the day b4 he does) im gonna email him hat way he has an email from me. which will be the 21st so the 22nd he'll read it..god im nervous..very nervous. but i think im inlove with him. i think about him constantly. and i see his face in my dreams, and if i could just meet him in person, i would be sooo happy.. but if he wants to be my online BF i will die of happiness.. not really die just scream and be really happy... i wonder if he is thinking about me while hes in either japan or hawaii....hmm...maybe if he does really like me, he will wanna be my bf. i hope so. cuz i really like him, love him... but im gonna take a chance and email him and tell him.. well bye 4 now.
