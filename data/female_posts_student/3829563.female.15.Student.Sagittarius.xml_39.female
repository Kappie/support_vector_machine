So I spent the last hour watching Wonderwoman. it is such a cheesy show. honestly. and its like 400 years old.  You know what I should really do? Nothing. My life is a mess here. well not really. Justin came over again. and lets just say something interesting happened. boys are truly weird. C'est tres stupide. Love is, that is.  I need to go for a skate. I really do.  Did I ever mention that DJ's are weird? Maybe I should be a Dj. i mean, i AM weird.
