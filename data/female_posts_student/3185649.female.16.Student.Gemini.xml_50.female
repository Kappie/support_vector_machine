We move slow and we are rarely anywhere close enough to shore to actually see any of the people we are out to liberate. We fly sorties such as Operation Short Term Missions, Operation School Curriculum, or Operation Beth Moore Conference. Most of us don't fly in these important missions, but there's nothing wrong with enjoying the prosperous life of a soldier. Our ship has plenty of activities - putting greens, a sports ministry, restaurants, and even a special 'fright house" on Halloween! We don't get a lot of visitors from the outside - but thats the benefit of being on a mega-sized luxury aircraft carrier - there's enough people around to pack it in without noticing the lack of outsiders (besides - you can't let just anybody on a luxury aircraft carrier - there's a war on!). Critics may say its more a cruise ship than a battle ship, but who said soldiers had to be uncomfortabe? Nope. We are going to win this war - and win it in style. God help the S.S. HouseChurch patroling the Chinese rivers. Perhaps we'll airlift in a care package of VeggieTales and Purpose Driven Books to help our poor brothers in the good fight. Fore!
