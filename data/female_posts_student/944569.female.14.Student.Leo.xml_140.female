My cousin introduced it to me.  I liked tennis but i thought an anime about it would be boring.  It's just addictive because most of the moves that they do are practically impossible and that's why it's a great escape from reality.  Q7. Who is your favourite character? I love them all.  Ryoma, Sakuno, Kikumaru, Fuji...  Q8. If you went on a date with the character from Q7, where would you go? Dunno.
