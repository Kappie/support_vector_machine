So as far as we know im perfectly normal and im not insane, right? and we dont know about the sudden appearance of the eyeliner? good.  ...too bad blogger doesnt work so i couldnt see if anyone commented on that. *shifty eyes*...im gonna be so mad at myself if that was actually posted and read. damn.  anyway, i guess its not that big of a deal... i just get mad when i do stupid things and let people know things i didnt intend for them to know. you know? well, haha, you dont. but...yes...   let all just pretend this never happened.  10 second tom.
