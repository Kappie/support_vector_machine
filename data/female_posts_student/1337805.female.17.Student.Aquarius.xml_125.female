Jessica: You're up first doll. The whole reason probably why this mess started was because of two things: a) I wanted to bitch at someone, and I was kinda hoping it was going to be you, just because. I needed to rip soemone up, it was going to be the first person that talked to me. I'm sorry it had to be you. b) You read a half finished post. That was mostly my fault that I didn't disclaimer that, but I had to get off the computer *pronto* to do something else in Info Tech, and never got the chance to finish it, or do anything but save it. Why I posted that? It was just bothering me how you tried to "force" people to comment, and I was providing the background information. I feel background helps you get into the situation properly, and enter the mindset I have, to help people understand what I'm thinking. Back to the comments thing - I was just gonig to say how I disliked that. I feel that comments should reflect your ideas on the post, and be totally optional. Yeah, it sucks when people don't comment a post you really wanted comments on, but what can you do? I was also going to say that it kinda does bother me when you do comment on my blog, and it has nothing to do with the original post. Kinda like what Sanford told you when he asked you not to comment on his, but a lot nicer. That was all.  In addition: It says in THREE different places if you are not mentioned, don't assume it's you. Three. Twice on my little note-y things, and once in my read me. There's an entire section on it in the Read me. And, you've done it before, reading a post and assuming it was all about you. (But that time it honestly wasn't, that time it was about Misha. Another story though.)  Chris: Seeing as I did really nothing to you, there was no need to overreact. That's great that you got mad at me because your friend was, but that's a little bit trendy. And creating fake sitautions wasn't cool at all. Honestly, all I could care about at the skate last night was my poor aching feet, knee and hands, and later, how we were getting home. Alright, I  am a bit of a hypocrite, and I'll admit it. Last night I was talking about someone behind there backs - but it wasn't you. It was Celine. And I'll get to that later. In short, there should be no reason why you are mad at me. If there is, please let me know.  Will: Same goes for you. You read a half finished post and over reacted. And you broke my blogger's rule about assuming, like Jess. And you were simply following the trend pattern of getting mad at me. So stop.  Alex: Again, same for you with the trend-whoreness. It's getting a bit sad now. Especially seeing as I barely talk to you, except when you are at school. So I really dont know what that is about.  Clare: You're just going to have to explain to me why you are mad at me, or someone, because I'm just at a loss of words over that. In fact, while you're at it, will someone tell me what I even DID to make everyone so mad at the skate? Exsist?  Celine: Honestly, you don't get an apology. This is explaining things to you FOR THE LAST TIME. Last night you were awful. Whenever me and Clare came up to talk to you, you would go away. And then when we called you on it, you ignored us. Then, expecting us to be psychic, you "forgot" to tell us that you couldn't give us a ride home. Now, yes, you may have said that you MIGHT be able to give us a ride, but when someone says might, you assume a yes with that. Everyone does. It's automatic. AS soon as you knew though, that we couldnt get a ride, the first thing you should have done, before figuring out how you wree getting home, was to TELL US. We are not supposed to know that we couldn't. And then even after the skate, when we were looking for your friend you still neglect to tell us. Only after did we find out when you were running away after your friend and her mom, shouting over your shoulder. Now, with that, knowing that late, how, honestly did you expect anyone to get home? What if we had done that to you? What would you have felt? If we had acted like that to you, the entire night? Would you been sitting here, feeling love for me? Of course not.  Honestly, I wish Clare's mom would have said "No, I can't pick you up", and hung up the phone. So we would have been forced to walk. Or hitchhike, or rely on one of my retarded friends to get us home. And then I wish that something would have happened to us, like getting abducted, or getting in an accident. Then, unless you really are an emotionless monster, you would be forced to think and say to yourself: If only I had told them earlier, picked up a phone and called them... Yes, Clare has a phone. How observant of you. That means it would have been even easier for you to tell us we couldn't get a ride. And then this whole thing would have been snapped in the but earlier, and no bad feelings occured. And just to let you know, you pull one more cute little thing like this (this is the second this month) and that's it. I don't care whether you are Adam's sister or GOD himself, I'll just do to you what I did to my other ex-best friend Misha. Block, delete, ignore. So if you really do "care about me", then watch your mouth.  Ash: Last straw with you too. I want to be your friend, and that's it. I know you like me still, but the feeling is not mutual. How many times do I need to tell you this before you finally get it? You are still treating me as your girlfriend, and I'm not. Even after I specifically tell you, don't touch me, you still do. I'm not interested. I'm not going to drag you downstairs and make sweet love to you. So stop thinking that! Then maybe I'll gain some more respect for you and treat you like a human again, instead of a virus that's in love with me. Take the feelings, put them in a box, and throw away the key. And whatever happened to those three ladies of yours that you claimed told you the same thing? I thought they were fictional, why would they single out me specifically? And if you think I singled you out and told you that, I did. Because you are the only one still trying to get into my heart!  Adam: I'm not mad at you, I just want to post about you, is all. :) Miss you madly, and we need to get together, PRONTO. I'm so mad at James right now, it's undescribable. Anyways, let's plan something. *kuds to you*  Sanford: Three letters, LDC. Are you and Erin going? Please let me know, because right now we have 0 participants, and the event will prolly be cancelled. And I must see my favorite Calgary people again! (Cora is my favorite as well, as well as Fiona. If you maybe wanna make her come too, I certainly won't protest :P)   I've ranted and spilled my heart enough. If I've missed someone, I'll get you later. In fact, I know for sure I've missed one person, and that's a debate I'm not sure whether I'm even gonig to get into, or post on here. Thanks for reading.
