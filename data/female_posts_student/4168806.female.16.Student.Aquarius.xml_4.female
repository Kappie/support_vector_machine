Ally!  wait up!  You lost your nametag (hands me a sugar packet with "SUGAR" printed across the top.)  Austin: I forgot my teddy bear.  Can I cuddle with you?  Brenden: I can read palms. Close your eyes (starts "tracing" lines on my palm, but is really drawing on it with a pen)  I see you will be calling me soon (his number has been written on my palm)  Brenden: are you as beautiful on the inside as you are on the outside?  Austin: (not a pickup line per say) Do you have a boyfriend?  Would you go out with me if I was a junior? Me: Austin, I'm not answering that.  go away. Austin: So is that a yes, because you don't want me to know?  or is that a no, because you don't want to hurt my feelings...? Me: Austin....go away. Austin: Come one, what is it?? Me: shut up! you're such a nerd.  Austin: Have you ever kissed a rabbit between the ears? Me: No.... Austin: (stands up and pulls the pockets out of his pants) Would you like to?  Austin: Are you strong? Me: Not particularly....but I mean, i could pick you up. Austin: Yeah but that's not hard.  You on the otherhand, I've been trying to pick you up all week and you just wont let me. Me: (blank....)  OHHH I GET IT!  Dan: wanna touch my pecs? Me: sure dan. Dan: Can I touch yours??? Me: um...yeah sure.  Dan: YES!  i got to touch the connective tissue to your upper bre*st! Me: Oh my god...*rolls eyes*  As I walk by a group of freshmen:  loudly: "DON'T YOU THINK RED HEADS ARE SO S*XY???" "YEAH...LIKE THAT ALLY G*RL..."  thanks guys...  or the inevitable stretching thing...we stretch and one of them is where you spread your legs and reach to your left then to your right, you know?  and austin goes "maybe later, ally"  i was just like...you sicko.  then there's the new kid Dustin who's a junior, he's just funny though, but he follows me around a bit  Dustin:  Did you hear about the kidnapping? Me: what happened? Dustin: He woke up.  During cleanup, I was walking with brenden Dustin: Hey ally, you missed a piece of trash. Me: Oh gee i'm sorry.  psh. Dustin: To your right Me: (i turn to my right and brenden is standing there) hahaha
