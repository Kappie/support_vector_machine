It's odd how there seem to be three worlds in our society - that of the adults, that of the teenagers, and that of the elementary school kids. Each of these three worlds, in their own ways, are identical. Several things that exist in both worlds:  1) Popularity contests. 2) Economic problems.  3) Social exclusion, racism, intolerance. 4) Relationships.  There are plenty more that I can't think of now. What bothers me is that each group successively looks down on the others. Adults look down on Teenagers and Kids. Teenagers look down on Kids. Kids look down on the younger children. I'm afraid of what the younger children are doing. But the point is, because adults have the age advantage and more experience, they get to make all the decisions... yet they continue to have the same problems that the other two groups have. I know several teenagers that could do a better job of running the UN than the current leaders...   I don't know. All I'm doing is confusing myself and saying things I'll later contradict myself on.   About relationships: In these three worlds, relationships seem to have the same significance. Yet adults and sometimes others in the groups look down on others in a lower group... because they don't believe Teenagers/Kids are capable of such emotions at their current age. They believe that T/K are too young to feel these emotions. I admit that in the past I, too, have been a skeptic, and I admit that I still am.   But I am a skeptic in the sense that I believe: it's very RARE for a T/K to feel these emotions at their age. Many times the emotion is not real - it is contrived; it is based off of what they have seen from their parents, or television, or books. But in some rare occasions, certain T/Ks have the maturity of mind to feel these emotions... just as though they were "adults." Sometimes although our experience, our education and our freedom is limited, we are still capable of feeling the strongest of emotions, and by that I mean love.  I believe in the CHANCE of love at fourteen. It's rare, it's hard to come by, but I believe in the chance.   There are some days when I feel like an "adult" already. This is one of them. I feel like I'll never find what I'm truly looking for at this time in my life... I know I'll have to wait. And being the impatient, impulsive girl that I am, this is going to be painful.   It's not always a contrivance.
