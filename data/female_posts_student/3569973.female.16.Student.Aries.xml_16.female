Not really too much...lol...yesterday I went to wal-mart to look for stuff to re-do my room in and I went to work and got off when I was supposed to, and that was about it, today I packed up most of my stuff, I went over to Jakes to play with Faith and to watch movies with her, then I had to go to work and I didnt get out of there until about 10, which is an hour after we close. Oh yeah and I ran in to Jessica, because they got back from their trip and she saw me at work and came to say hi and gave me a present, which was really fun for me because I love getting presents and it was also really great to see her. So tomorrow Im getting all the stuff I need to paint with and my paint and coming home and getting everything out and stuff so that when my parents get off, Jake and just come over and move my furniture and we can start painting, even though thats not what we had planned for tomorrow night, but thats okay. Then Saturday if we dont have time to start painting then we'll do it then and put the sponge color on. Then Im gonna end up having to go to work at about6 I think. So Im gonnabe busy for the next two days, which is fine with me. Well thats all I have now, Im kinda in a lets fix everything and clean things out right now mood. So Tell then, Later Days
