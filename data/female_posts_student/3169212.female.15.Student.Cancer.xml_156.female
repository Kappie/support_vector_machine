Then they are taking some and thickening it with baking soda and water to use to marinate steaks.  it turns out that because rum has so much alcohal in it, the different types cancel out each other and make it tast more alcohalic withought having that much alcohal.  That is why you must drink a lot to get drunk.  Elizabeth:  So that is why jack didnt get drunk after 5 bottles of rum when we were on that island.  Jenn: exactly!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Please dont remind me about the Island, mates.  Jenn: the whole burning rum thing!   CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: yea.  Elizabeth: im sorry Jack but i wanted to get out and save Will  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: I understand, love  Elizabeth: Really?  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  I was able to vent on the island, im not mad it is just a scar.
