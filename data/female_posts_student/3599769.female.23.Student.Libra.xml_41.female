I don't want them anymore. I wish that I had never met you, even though I'm glad I did. I wish that I would have never kept any of my promises so I wouldn't hold you to the ones that you made to me. I wish that in my head there wasn't someone new in your life, even though in reality there really might be. I wish I didn't care so damm much about my munchkins. That I would lay my life down for them. I wish that I could open the top of my head, and with a scapel scrape the bits and pieces that you have infested. I wish my favorite part of the day wasn't connected to you in any way. I wish that I could stop saying "I can't believe that this is happening to me". I hope that I can in the near future say those exact words because everything is so great. I wish that I could be the one who doesn't feel the same anymore. I wish that you would have never have said "This is it, this is what its all about." They meant so much to me. I wish those words were true. I wish I never had you on a pedestal as high as the one your on, cause no matter how high I jump I can't knock you off. So you can take all the memories and choke on them and realize that that's how I've been feeling. I know what we had is over and facing that reality doesn't really make me feel any better. I'm not stupid, or naive. I know that we must/will go on. I just never imagined it would be without you in my life. You took so much so I'd like it returned. And in return I will gladly give you our memories. So yes, I still feel the need and want to be with you because I love you not because I don't think I can't live without you. I know that I can live without you, I just think life would be a lot more fun with you and my munchkins. I hope you find the happiness you are looking for, the one you couldn't find with me anymore.
