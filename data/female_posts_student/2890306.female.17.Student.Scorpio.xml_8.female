I, Katie Rose Fritz, am not allowed to have a bad day or everyone thinks I'm going crazy.  *shrug*  That might be true, but it's certainly not the point.  Either way, I've decided not to slip into it again, at least for a while.  Optimism is a gift that I have been bestowed with, and I like to embrace it as much as I can.  Share the love, right?  Tonight, I don't have much homework.  I just need to read a bit of  The Great Gatsby  and finish my vocabulary.  The latter, I don't really mind.  The former, I would rather skip.  You see, I hate forced reading.  I just can't bring myself to sit down and trudge through a jumble of words, for I know I'll just fall asleep.  *sigh*  Ah well, what must be done must be done, as much as I hate to admit it.  Mom and I went shopping after supper, and I had a bit of luck.  I bought a pair of neat pants, decorated with delicate brown stripes, and a lovely lavender sweater, with a v-neck design in front and back.  Also, Mom was kind enough to purchase some new work pants for me.  They're quite snazzalicious.  My current work pants are corduroy, for at the time I started my job, they were the only black pants I owned.  (Sad, I know...)  And, as you all know, summer weather is starting to appear, and I wanted a pair of nice breathable pants.  I have them!  Whee!  I can't wait to work on Thursday to try them out.  Now, it is nearing my bedtime, and my snack is almost done cooking in the oven.  Only 6 minutes to go until I can indulge in the heavenly food known as biscuits and gravy.  So, with this, I'm out.
