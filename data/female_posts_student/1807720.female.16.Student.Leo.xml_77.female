I did the math test in the morning and I got all confused with the word problem stuff and well I checked on the ucourses sight and I got a 69% which isn't too bad but it could be better.  I guess it wasn't too bad though.  The chem quiz was bad though.  I studied...I practiced...I did my work.  I did the first page fine and then I flipped the quiz over and the second side was like a nightmare in a quiz.  It was awful.  My mind just shut down and I could not figure out how to do some of the stuff.  I felt bad and well yeah I failed my other quiz and the one thing I really did not need right now is to fail another one.  I don't know what to do.  Everything I try to explain to her that I don't understand and I really need help all she tells me is that it is easy for her and says "I don't understand why this is so hard for you."  She makes me feel bad and stupid when I ask her things.  It isn't my fault that I don't understand everything she teachs.  I just don't get it, and even when I did think I understood I failed.  I need to pass chem and well yeah get a good mark.  When universities see that I barely passed chem then I don't think they will even take a second look at me.  I was so down today cause I kept thinking about university and stuff and the future.  I know I have to follow my heart if I want to be happy, but this stage right now isn't the happiest of em' all.  I think I might be one honours though for the half term.  Fingers crossed, I just have to pull off a chem average over 65% which yeah I think I am capable of.  My latest labs I got like 100%, 80%, and like a 93% so that will really help my mark cause the quiz thing certainly yeah did not go over well.  Now that I think of it today wasn't totally bad, I guess it was ok.  I am going to try be a little happier tommorow but the weather is really starting to affect me.  Also Travis kept talking to me about websites and games and stuff.  To be honest it was boring.  I got over that stuff in like grade 8 and like seriously if I could I would tell him "move on man" but that would be rude and I don't want to offend him.  I don't really share too many of the same interests as him but I notice that he is falling for me, and coming on to me, but I am not falling for him.  I am falling for Andrew B.  I remember in gr. 9 we did not really like each other and like went out and it went horrible but he is in my CALM class now.  I always end up talking to him like all the time and it is sooooo natural.  It feels right and he has goals in life and takes school very very seriously.  I like that about him and well I like her personaliy.  He is friendly and easy going and stuff.  I don't know if he feels the same way but I think it might a little bit cause I am getting the signs you know.  I don't want to be rude to Travis though and I don't want to let him know I am not really into him.  He keeps trying to like "get me" over to his house.  I am kinda freaked out about that.  He kepts condums in his pocket and keeps talking about how he wants me to come into the hot tub with him.  Like if he wants "you know" and stuff than I am not the girl for him.  I don't want hurt him though and I think I will still give it a go and do something on Friday with him.  I am afraid that if I tell him that I am not into him the way he likes me than he will go back to not doing his working and cheating on tests.  After I started listening and paying attention he made more of an effort to do work and didn't cheat again on science as I am aware.  See that is what bothers me though.  He isn't as serious, focused or dedicated as I am.  I have goals in life, dreams.  I want to go places, be someone.  For him I can't really say which in a sense is kind of sad.  I guess whatever happens will happens.  I believe in fait and destiny, so whatever will be will be.     You're Most Like The Season Summer ...  Whoa.... Passionate eh ??
