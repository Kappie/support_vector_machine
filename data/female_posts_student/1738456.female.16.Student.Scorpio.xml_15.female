I stared into his green eyes while he set me down gently. Half of me questioned what I was feeling. The other half said to kiss him. But how could I possibly want to kiss the empty-headed Prince I had only just met? Love at first sight had never been real to me. Was I just going to throw that faith away? I didn’t even know his name.   While these loud, bothersome thoughts jabbered on in my head, I never let go of the Prince. I never looked out of his eyes. My body and brain continued working in different directions for unknown lengths of time. My heart argued with my brain, but no part of me heard it or cared. I just stood with my arms around the Prince, not listening to the war caused by my own inner turmoil. A gong sounded somewhere off in the distance, and the argument inside me ceased. The earth beneath us dropped a few inches, and I held on tighter to the Prince to keep my balance. He steadied me with his hands on my back.  “What do people call you?” I asked him cautiously.  “Prince, Highness, Sir,” he said unthinkingly. The sky opened, and a flash of light swept over us. Rain poured down gently, soaking us both through our clothes. I held on tightly to him to keep some warmth in my body.  “You mean, you have no name?” How could I love or even like someone who didn’t have a name.   “Oh, my name,” he said as if he hadn’t thought or heard of it in years. “My name, is Zeke.” Then I smiled and leaned in, and we kissed.  His hands pulled me in tight, and I wrapped my arms around his neck. I could feel our chests pushed in tightly together, and the beating of our hearts synchronized. We turned so my back was on the tree, and one of his hands cradled my face as we kissed. The other ran a finger across my stomach, sending a sweet sensation up through my spine to my chest, and down to my hips. I sighed and broke away. I leaned my head into his neck, and he put his hands on my shoulders. I smiled and looked at the sky. It had frozen with the clouds parted to let out a bolt of lightning that had never come. The rain had stopped in mid-air, not bothering to fall all the way to the ground. I lifted my arm, to see my watch. The face had shattered, and the hands were gone. The world had stopped for one single kiss, and I had thought romance was only hallucination.
