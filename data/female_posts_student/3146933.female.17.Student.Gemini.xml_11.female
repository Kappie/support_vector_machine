If MATT is "talking" with Leslie then whatever...let them talk...let them watch movies...I talk and watch movies with other guys too...what's the big deal? Talkin and watchin movies doesn't mean you're in a serious relationship. Oh he has me shakin and cryin right now. I cant stand guys sometimes. bleh i feel sick. I'm talkin to matt...and I jus found out a bunch of stuff that has been makin me mad isn't even true...go figure. "hey! lets be 18 and act 10!" *rolls eyes* Man, I'm startin to hate most of the male gender...lol...that doesn't sound good. I'm seriously..debating on moving to Florida. Seriously. One condition being we move close to my cousins...I'm sure they know a lot of good people and they could help me get comfy down there. They're like 18..or 19..around the same age as me anyways. But yeah livin in FL would be pretty cool...I've always wanted to live there again..kinda..at least i'd be further from matt....i love him. God, I love him. remember to dl Ares
