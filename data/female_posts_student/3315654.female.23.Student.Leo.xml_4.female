Yes it was nice getting away from the smog for a while. And IF I COULD post pictures I would, but I guess I'll have to email them out (yea u christin, the only one that reads this) because stupid blogspot stopped selling their upgraded version - is that stupid or what? they dont want money? whatever... well see if they get their heads out there ass soon, or else i'll have to move.   ok yea so i was in north carolina. i left nadias house really wanting a pet. kalua and lady ... aww they're like kids i swear. i came back for a week, then i went off to guanajuato for a 4 day weekend, but i really didnt party or anything down there. my dad set up a little conv. store by the house he built and so i went and set up the cash register, programmed it and taught the people that are working the store how to use it. becuase they were totally running it like it was the 17th century all by hand. plus they were jacking us. this store better pull in some good cash cuz thats what im planning will subsidize my 'rents retirement. i dont want to be getting "send some money" calls when im older. lol.   ok christin- i wanna tell you something. DONT get discouraged by the entire school situation. because you'll never believe what.... i finally got my gpa high enough to get into Bauer. and if i can do it, i know you can. it was sooo incredibly low at one point. And you better hurry up too because i've heard they're thinking about bumping it up to 3.00   it was awful though- i went in to talk to the advisor and he was like yeah well you got denied last semester but with spring semester grades i think youll be over the requirement. I got 3 a's and a c last semester. (but two of those were spanish and one was public speaking) i aint all that proud. so i walked out of there all happy that i was pretty much in, i just had to post the application online. and when i did, i got the ugliest email saying i wasnt in - because i didnt meet the requirements. i was a total mess. i couldnt sleep or anything. then i got mad because the guy had all but assured me i was in. next day i get this email saying oops we messed up you in. what!!! that could have totally changed everything had i not questioned it! i would have gone to UH downtown, because i had run out of classes. agghhh, i get all worked up talking about it again. ok this is long. be back in a couple... really ;)
