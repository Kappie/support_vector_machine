That was fun, not too much happened there. Then after that we headed over to Wal*Mart. Alot of ppl bought airbrush shirts. Me and Lauren got matching shirts that say Lauren and Shelny, Best Friends, Panama City 2004 on the back and Big Sister and Lil Sister on the front. While we were waiting on those to get done, me and Chelsea and Amber went to buy sheets b/c we didnt bring any. So we were walking and singing Jesus loves me and talking to random ppl. We get to these guys and we start talkin to him and Chelsea notices one has a hole in their pants. So me and Chelsea get on our knees and bow down to him. It was hilarious. After that we went up to the counter to get them to page 'Ritaboo', but they wouldnt. So we had to settle for them pagin Rita Martin (Ally's real name) and they did it 2. Then 5 minutes later we hear it again. And of course we, being the dorks we are, cracked up. Somewhere in all of that, me and Chelsea carried around granny panties. *lol* Then we came home, some people went swimming and then we did our devotion, the people went back to swimming. After that, me callie chelsea and lauren went "around the corner" to talk to Corey. Then we got in trouble and mrs shelia was being mean for no reason. We talked for a little while, and I finally went to sleep around 2:00. Then Sunday came around...
