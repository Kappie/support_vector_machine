I know that last year  urlLink Anna ,  urlLink Tazz  and I went to  urlLink Brother Jimmy's Bait Shack  for their NYE shindig.  It was prepaid admission of like $60 but it was all you could eat and drink (including the fishbowls of swampwater!), free party favors, groovable music, yummy bbq, a free champagne toast at midnite.  It was a blast, well worth the money.  Its strictly 21+ though, so this might be a problem to rally the whole group together, but worth it if you guys can scrounge up a fake in time.  We could also get a hotel room and all that fun stuff (I'm thinking something reminiscent of the February HardRock Shindig).  You all know how to get in touch with me by now so let me know what some suggestions are, it will surely be a blast!!!  For the rantings: 1.  This is America, speak English or get out, goddamnit! 2.  You're not helpless, stop trying to get everything for free, jerk. 3.  Ashley, stop this car crap right now.  Im sick of it.  Why is Chrysler calling me and asking me for my lawyers name and phone number when a) I dont have a lawyer and b) I'm not suing anyone?!?  You told me to write and sign an affidavit that you had to pick up on Sunday or else you would die.  I wrote it.  Where were you Sunday?  You never even called to double check.  Why am I busting my butt to settle this?  You told me you were going to settle this mess.  Forget your abusive boyfriend, now you're gonna have to answer to me.  Let me make something clear:  urlLink I intend to bring the pain.  4.  I hate everyone except for  urlLink The Don ,  urlLink Doogie  and Jeff C (no relation to  urlLink Sabrina_C ) cause they're the only ones who respect my authoritah as "she who is the provebial llamas pajamas. 5.  For the love of all things good and holy: hire me, please!
