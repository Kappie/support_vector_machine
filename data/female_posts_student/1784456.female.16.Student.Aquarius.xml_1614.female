(I tried to get everyone to go 'eee' instead of 'ahhh' but it didn't work!) Counting the wrong number for the countdown worked though! (And I get away with it, if anyone turns around I can just stare at a kid near me!) MUHAHHAAA! So this is why people like being adults huh? (I'm not  that  ignorant!) Ahehehee... ok. Ahh tomorrow I made a pact to ...er ... what was it? Not talk about my cats and spinsterhood ;P and Izzy has to not talk about Pete (her bfg) and Emma has to not talk about her hair! So we're all gonna end up talking about the weather! Woohoo!
