We beat Clinton Tuesday night 4-0 (and I scored a goal!). But the other games we lost off of some crap call or stupid mistake. We could have won all of them but oh well. I'm going to keep running because I feel like I'm in okish shape now and I need to keep that up for preseason. So if anyone wants to go running with me that would be the greatest.   Gavin stopped buy last night and I looked like crap. I don't care though because I felt like crap too. Maybe I'm getting sick or something.   I babysat Paige on Tuesday. Paige, my aunt, Makenzie, Kelsey, Emily, my grandma, and I all went to Ward's for lunch. Then we went up to camp. I didn't go tubing or anything because I needed to save my arms for field hockey but I was a spotter. Aubree was there. She is so cute and she says the funniest things.   Today or tomorrow I'm not doing anything at all I think. Boredom...not fun.   And by the way, the comment in a couple posts back that someone posted--you might as well just tell me who you are because I will find out and it will be worse if I have to go through the trouble to find out. So just tell me who it was and I won't be mad (maybe).   Listening to: [You're The Only One by Maria Mena]    Well I saw you with your hands above your head  Spinning around, trying not to look down  But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground  Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes  And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before  And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though   You're the only one who  Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams  You're the only one who  Knows exactly what I mean   And I probably forgot to tell you this  Like that time I forgot to tell you about the scar  Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel?  See you're not what I expected  But you're the only one who knows how to handle me  And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree   You're the only one who  Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams  You're the only one who  Knows exactly what I mean   I hope you can forgive me for that time  When I put my hand between your legs  And said it was small  Cuz its really not at all  I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down  Just to keep you around  Cuz the day you realize how amazing you are  You're gonna leave me   You're the only one who  Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick  You're the only one who  Knows exactly what I mean   You're the only one who  Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams  You're the only one who  Knows exactly what I mean   Exactly what I mean   Well I saw you with your hands above your head  Spinning around, trying not to look down  But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground
