But today...Today is a different story...lol  My Day   Well...It started off this morning with us just staying here while Mama and Johnny took Mamaw to the Doctor. Then we went to the pool...Wow the pool...Well it all started out well...then all the guys were fighting over me! Ive never been faught over before!! Ok so I'm hangin out with Cody, Justin, Spud and Toby. Jamie, Krista, and Raymond are there and they are around with us also. Well...Cody and I got to talking and He would protect me when anyone would mess with me which I thought was really cool so i Hung around with him more. Toby Got jealous and kept trying to take me away...and then Cody would save me! Spud would get in there and try to get me too...lol it was fun and all...Cody was all over me...hehe I think someone likes me...Only problem is that he is with Jennifer...and I dont want to ruin Mine and Jenn's friendship because of a guy...Thats just not cool. Cody and I got in trouble for PDA at the pool...he got my number from me and even invited me to the bowling alley tonight!!I dont want any of this stuff to put mine and David's relationship into a bad place...cuz i really love David and I cant help what other guys do...hehe!So anyways...I get home and I talked to Tim for a while on the phone, and I met Keiths GF Tasha...shes really cool...we have alot in common. I'm hoping Cody will call me sometime he is a really cool guy and would be a great friend I think. Well...I am going to make this short tonight...My sunburn is KILLING me!!!
