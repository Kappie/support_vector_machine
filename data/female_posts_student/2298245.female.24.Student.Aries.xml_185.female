I mean, some of the stuff was familiar from when I took Professional Responsibility last semester, which I'm still bitter about having had to take, considering I have to sit through the torture of preparing for this exam as well.  Ah,  c'est la vie .   Now, I'm rewarding myself by taking the evening off, watching some movies perhaps (otherwise just television), and finishing up my second trip through the third Harry Potter book.  And there's chocolate ice cream waiting for me in the freezer, which, considering it is the only edible item in my whole apartment, will most certainly be devoured sometime soon.  It will not survive the night.  It's perhaps not the most exciting way to spend a Saturday night, but it is relaxing, and that's about the best that I can hope for from my life at the moment.  I had a better offer for tonight - but I need to be productive tomorrow, so I really can't be out until all hours.  That said, it is Gina's birthday celebration, and I'm very sorry I have to miss it.  If only my law school friends were into more low key forms of entertainment.  Re-reading the above prior to posting this, and seeing the progression of my thoughts, I must say that it never ceases to amaze me how my mind works.  I hope this stream-of-consciousness thing is working for everyone else...I'll try and be more structured in the future.  'Til then...
