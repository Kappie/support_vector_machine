Anyways..I thought John was sweet..and I don't think he was the one talking on Reid's sn most of the time. And I think the only reason he broke up with Heidi is because of Reid. Anyways so after I got home from Heidi's last night, I made a deal, and didn't see my shooting star so that kinda freaked me out..but Hayls and Heid helped me out and calmed me down lol..it was good. I love those girls.      ahh.. summer's almost over! How sad :-( Let's make the best of these last few weeks.. hehe      *Love ya               Syda*
