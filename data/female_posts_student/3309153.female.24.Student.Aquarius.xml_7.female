My recent trip to New York did however inspire me for the August assignment!  Now it's just finding the time to sit down and work on the idea that will be challenging.  Has anyone else come up with an idea, or has this last semester sucked out your creativity?  Oh, I saw today at the Java Monkey that they have open-mic nights there.  Anybody attend those events? Hugs,  -Amanda
