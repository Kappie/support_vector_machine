Oh wait...I allready joined...Oh well...I ate a squishy cookie for lunch. Yay for the squishy cookie! I also showed my teacher what anime is. ~smile~~smile~ Curse you Alina, making me change my backround. But I guess the blue backround is ok...I guess i'll post my poems now. Bye till the next post!    Lost Love   You thought love was a game,   You allways wanted to play,   You joked around silly,   You lost me in one day,   If you missed me so much,   Then where was your call,   Your lies are so big,   And your truths are so small...   Quiet Blood   Thinking in the dark,    Talking on the phone,   Laying in your bed,   Look you're all alone,   You smile and close your eyes,   And then hum your special note,   You open up your eyes,   As a person slit your throat...
