I called Sara's cell and nobody answered, Allie can't do anything tonight, Sarah is babysitting tonight and tomorrow, and then Kaci is supposed to call me back in about 15 minutes. I might call Caro too, I dunno. I just want to do something tonight! Lol. Last night nobody was online, it was gay. But I still managed to stay up until 3 AM doing nothing haha.   If you can't already tell, I have a wide range of music likes. I'm a huge John Mayer fan, I love O.A.R., Dave Matthews Band... but I also am a Doors fan, and some 80s music is pretty good. This song is one of my favorites. I guess you'd have to actually hear it to get the full effect, but yeah. Mhm.  "Case in point: their other Songs from the Big Chair-spawned, No. 1 hit, "Everybody Wants to Rule the World," was a meditative contemplation of the struggle for power within interpersonal relationships as a metaphor for global supremacy--which, thank god, had a good beat so you could at least dance to it." --Billy Altman  One of the best songs ever made...  Everybody Wants to Rule the World  Welcome to your life There's no turning back Even while sleep We will find you Acting on your best behaviour Turn your back on mother nature Everybody wants to rule the world It's my own design It's my own remorse Help me to decide Help make the most Of freedom and of pleasure Nothing ever lasts forever Everybody wants to rule the world There's a room where the light won't find you Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down When they do I'll be right behind you So glad we've almost made it So sad they had fade it Everybody wants to rule the world I can't stand this indecision Married with a lack of vision Everybody wants to rule the world Say that you'll never never never need it One headline why believe it? Everybody wants to rule the world All for freedom and for pleasure Nothing ever lasts forever Everybody wants to rule the world  That's it for now...
