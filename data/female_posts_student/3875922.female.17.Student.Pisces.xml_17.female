AND IT WAS !!!!! they met at club motherfucker!? or something. anyway. alex said, oh your the rory whos fuck buddies with phoebe!? WHAT!? whats going on!!!! seriously..... then what surprised me even more, was the fact that alex said that she was coming to richmond next year! WHAT! WHAT THE FUCK! i hope thats a silly little joke..... it would be funny if she did, end up coming though.... hahahaha. i might like it though.  oh my god. what the hell is going on!?  anyway. in my confused present state, i must be off.  and im going for drinks with dominic when he gets back from melbourne........ he's great. such a wanker. i love the way he admits it. great great great. he has a girlfriend!!! finally.... its so cute.  anyway. i better be off  xxk
