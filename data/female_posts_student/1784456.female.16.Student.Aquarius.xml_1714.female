Hehe, this is just too stupid... ahh new theme tune for me. Mmm quite scary that I can actually imagine listening to it! Oh, I'm doing a tango for one of my compositions so that's why I'm listening to it! Not too random. Wow, it just got cooler, the 70s backing singers! Yeay! Ahh, it's people like Pudelsi *is it a person* who make GCSE music worth doing... heheee! she plonta? What's that all about...? Anyway back to a slightly more interesting for you but less for me point.... Taaangoooo Libiiiidoooo! *ahem* Oh, it's Polish! That's why it's so strange to listen to! Geez five minutes? No chance! I also got myself some fair trade chocolate! The fair trade freak in me has been set free! No one is safe! Well... actually you are unless I see you near Nestle products. And fair trade clothes too! Yeay! So go order a catalogue ok?  urlLink http://www.peopletree.co.uk
