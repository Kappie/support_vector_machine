Anyway, I got these cool little notes from an old friend who reminded me that focusing on what was lost leaves little or no time for you to appreciate what you have.  Yes, I am a weird person.  I admit that wholeheartedly, but there is one thing about me...I love completely, so although I may be harsh to those I love, I love them and would do anything for them.    Anyway, I am thinking of planting more things...any suggestions...I hear green beans are good...haha  I need to get some of those.  Oh and fried green tomatoes, I have to try that, a good friend tells me they are good.    Take care everyone and have a good day...I hope Ed does come home today and that things have not changed...but with the military, you never really know.
