We were going to go to the pool but then it rained so we didn't get to. So Katie came over and we made friendship bracelets. We then ate ice cream which of course was good. Then we watched Italian Job. I love that movie so much. It is just so cool. The people who made thought up the script must be some smart people. Then we listened to music and then ate pasta. Then we left to drop Tomoko off, and go to the church pool party. I FINALLY GOT ACROSS THE LILLY PADS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It may have taken me a couple of years but i did it!!!!!!!!! Yea so now i'm doing this. ttyl
