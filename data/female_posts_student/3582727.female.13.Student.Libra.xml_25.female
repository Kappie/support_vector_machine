And somehow it's disappointing that those things were already just how I want them.        Oh well. This is nice. Woo Blogger!        I usually separate my thoughts into separate posts, but now I'm going to put them all into one. So it'll sound very scattered and fragmented, in all likelihood. Well, that's the best way to represent my brain, anyhow.        First and foremost, I have decided that I want to be a writer. Not so much because I'm any  good  at writing, or even because I particularly enjoy it. It's just that if I could be absolutely anything, a writer is what I would be. I like the idea of it. But I tend to dismiss such ambitions as hopeless fantasies. But then I realize that I've got five good years ahead of me before I have to actually start my life, so I might as well use them to write. Who knows? Maybe...it'll work... Oh, who am I kidding?        Anyway, I registered at  urlLink http://www.fictionpress.com and posted a couple of poems that I wrote a few months ago. If you want to read them, go right on ahead:  urlLink http://www.fictionpress.com/~jharpergreen .        July has gone by very quickly. I find it hard to believe that summer's so nearly over. I'm not completely dreading school, though I know I probably should be. See, sixth and seventh grade were both horrible, so I keep thinking that eighth grade is  bound  to be good, right? But then, if my first two years of middle school were shit, why would the third be any better? Ah well. It'll happen soon enough, and I'll just find out then.        My mom, my brother, and I had an interesting conversation about deoderant the other day. My brother is...not one for hygiene. He's probably used deoderant about twice in his twelve years of life. And trust me, he needs it. It was really hilarious, though -- you know, one of those conversations that I'd just  love  to have on tape. He doesn't quite understand the  function  of the stuff... He kept saying things like, "Well, why can't I just take a shower when I smell bad?" Oh, yeah, take a shower in the middle of school... It's a mystery to me that the boy's actually quite  popular...         I think I'm a little italics-happy. It's just nice to be able to use ctrl+i like I always do on Word. ...That hasn't always worked on Blogger, has it?        I love the movie  Orange County.  The message seems to be something like: "People are stupid no matter where you go. There is no escape." Too true.        I want to see  Supersize Me.         VW's neighbor was in  Pillow Talk.  My dad and brother didn't believe her, but it turns out she wasn't lying at all. The neighbor's name is Lois Rayman, and we're thinking she was Tony Randall's secretary. Not that anyone should reasonably care. Hm.        Okay. There's a very random entry with no flow whatsoever. A writer, indeed.
