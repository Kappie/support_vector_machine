I bet a lot of interesting stuff happens to you people, and like...say it, I guess...I really can't be more convincing than that.  Anyway, some of you might find this kinda funny, even if u dun particularly care. The RIAA , the damn suits who've been suin' everyone who gets some bytes of music across the net, had their site inexplicably shut down for 5 days, from March 17th to the 22nd. They didn't give any comments on it, only admiting that the site was down. Possibly a virus to blame, but still kinda funny how it got 'em.  urlLink Full Story.   Lesse, sides that, not a whole lot in terms of public interest has been goin' on, really, just stuff. I'm stallin' doin' hw right now. Oh I finally got to see Underworld by way of my cable's Movies on Demand. Kick ass movie, man, seriously. Oh and, for humour, look for on the internet, movies by the flash artists Group X. Funny stuff, some might need you to have broadband, 'cause they're so big.  If you really hate the RIAA and want to kill their babies..or just wear tees that say how much you dislike them or sumthin', go  urlLink here.   Welp, off to do a bunch of other crap! I'm the Zenman, peace and tranquility...or some other bs like that...  "Cocaine's a hell of a drug!"
