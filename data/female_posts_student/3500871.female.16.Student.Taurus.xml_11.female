And when everything starts breaking down You take the pieces off the ground. Show this Wicked Town something beautiful and new. You think that luck has left you there  But maybe there's nothing up in the sky. And there's no mystical design No cosmic lover preassigned. There's nothing you can find That can not be found. 'Cuz with all the changes you've been through It seems the strangers always you. Alone again in some new Wicked Little Town. And when you've got no other choice You know you can follow my voice Through the dark turns and noise of this Wicked Litte Town.  It's a Wicked... Little Town. Goodbye Wicked.... Little Town.
