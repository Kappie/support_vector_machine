TSL is really a pig.. sunday also must have tuition... had a tiring band practice yesterday... actually dun feel like going.. but when i wanted to continue sleeping.. jade's voice keep on ringing through my head... her words 'yvonne.. must remember to come for band' keep me from sleeping in peace... when playing the honour glory.. horn section got tortured the most.. even if we are in the band room.. we had to hold our horn up horizontally... really tiring.. all our hands trembling like hell... muscles aching... my leg is aching more... had 2.4 run on friday... got the worst timing ever.. my god... cant believe i run so slow... tuesday still got rehersal for the band.. jade is surely gonna nag at me again... going go for tuition already... wish me lucks...
