They got in to their usual screaming and swearing fight and Steph's dad hit her. Steph freaked and ran away and ended up at our friend Lorna's house. Steph told Lorna's mum everything that happened and she called the police. Now she's back in foster care, this has happened before so Child Protective Services is looking in to abuse charges. Steph isn't allowed to go back to her house until the investigation is over so she has barely any clothes or other personal items. Life sucks major ass. I was eating lunch with Steph today and she was crying half the time, I didn't even know what to say. What can I say?   On a lighter note, my children's book turned out really well. We has a sort of open presentation of them today and Sophal's friend told me my book was "hella pimpin". Excuse me? Can children's books be hella pimpin'? Ah well it's a complement, I should leave it alone.
