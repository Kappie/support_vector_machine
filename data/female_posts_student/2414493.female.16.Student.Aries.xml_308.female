I almost feel bad for the professor--people were falling asleep. I did my best to stay awake, but it made me wonder, what do I look like when I nod off in class? Lit I just couldn't absorb anything, really. Day by day I feel worse about not  saying  something in class, but then again, I try to comfort myself by reminding myself that when I get home, maybe I'll have something to say. Maybe.  I wonder, how do people find the one thing that they absolutely love? For me, it might be journalism; I just get sucked in. Or mock trial. It's definitely not something science. How long does one have to go searching before they hit something good?  Charlie and Jenn are going to Dartmouth tomorrow at 6:30 am. Unless I want to spend some good quality time with Matt and Adam and Aaron, I think I'll have the day mostly to myself.  I still have the paper to write.  I'm so tired.
