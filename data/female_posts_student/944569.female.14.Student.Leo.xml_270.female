Being perfect might be great but if you think about it, if you're perfect then you have no reason to live. Like, one of the reasons to live is to be the best you can right?  To better yourself every day and live life at its fullest.  But, if you're perfect, what fun is there to live for?  I find it best to always try and better ourselves rather than be perfect all the time.   In fact, if humans do achieve perfection, they'd want it to be even MORE perfect.  Do you guys agree?
