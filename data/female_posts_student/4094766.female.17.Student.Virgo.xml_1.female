I am not really sure if I like it yet or not but it was what was on my mind.  When we first meet I was naive I couldn’t believe didn’t want to conceive people living just for today using girls and drugs to get away I went against advice and started falling for you I wouldn’t havehad I knew nothing’s in that empty head tin man heart made of lead  A teddy bear and to many tears you looked away for to many years you stole my heart time after time but now I’m takin my life makin it mine  Deceive me once but I’m all right lied about dreams lied about nights sixteenth birthday you started a fight to stoned to remember I pretend its alright back together and I’m dancing with you held me close my cold lips turned blue said you love me till we get old to this day don’t believe when I’m told said you always wanted me by your side just another time you lied  A teddy bear and to many tears you looked away for to many years you stole my heart time after time but now I’m takin my life makin it mine  Now here’s my big mistake gave it up now years to late for the first time I was really with you felt more than lips when I kissed you I truly though I had my man even in public you held my hand held me naked close in your bed told me you loved me but fucked her instead  A teddy bear and to many tears you looked away for to many years you stole my heart time after time but now I’m takin my life makin it mine I’m takin my life and makin it mine   To many times I’ve been lied to tried my hardest to despise you but I cant and the reason I’ve found you can’t hate what’s not around numb inside is all I can feel cus who you are isn’t real you’re a little boy not a man for the first time I understand nothings real between you and me a teddy bear and to many tears the only things you’ve given me
