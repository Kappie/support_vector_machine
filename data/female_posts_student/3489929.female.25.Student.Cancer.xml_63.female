And I love him, even though his moods are more bipolar than mine. And no matter how mad he makes me, I still think I got relatively lucky in the dad department. He always comes through when I need him the most.      He is beside himself, because he is so happy that I am going back to school. He's almost more excited than I am. He wants me to ride with him to Mississippi this weekend and look at apartments, because he wants to get me one if we can find one near school that is not too expensive, IF dorm/room  board expenses turn out to be too much (I'll know tomorrow). He also wants to take me around to find a part-time job. He and my mother are going to help me move to MS in two weeks. They both keep calling me, reminding me to do this, and do that, and make sure I take this, and leave that (and my mother keeps trying to get me to leave my damn Gazelle here so she can play with it, because she's certain I won't have room for it- so I asked her if she wants a fat daughter forever, and she laid off).       I forgot how much my dad enjoys the whole school process. He likes to discuss classes and map out a plan- I think it came from his being forced to drop out of college when he was younger, because he had a family to support (my dad is actually very smart, but that's sometimes overshadowed by his tendency to be an asshole much of the time). He's not getting to do it much with my brothers; Nick's been taking art classes at community college for going on four years now, submitting work and waiting to get discovered. John's starting this fall but only taking two classes; he's trying to get his average up so he can get into Auburn. John wants to coach high school football and teach history. I think it's a good idea, but Daddy doesn't. He keeps pushing for John to go into physical therapy. He wants all three of us to be better than he was, not that there is anything AT ALL wrong with my parents. He secretly harbors the dream that one of us kids will provide for him in his old age. Plus, he wants to be able to brag.      That is something I think I have nipped in the bud, though. It used to bother the shit out of me that I would visit my dad at work, and people I did not know would come up to me and congratulate me on my latest achievement. It was flattering, I guess- I just get easily embarrassed and don't like it. So Daddy is under strict orders not to tell ANYONE in the family or any of his buddies that I am back in school. If anyone asks where I am, I got a job offer in MS. I don't want any naysayers, and my family is especially good at that.      Two weeks from today will be my last day at my job. I'll have to say farewell to Jefe, Posh, and the rest of the zany crew- most, if not all, of whom I will probably never see again. I have a few regrets, but I know this is all for the best. I wasn't meant to spend my life there, but I am grateful for the time I spent therein.      Moving forward... I'm thinking about pre-law. I'd be done with law school by the time I turn 30. That's not bad. It was my major before, and I can double it with English.      God bless government aid. And Stafford loans. And Pell Grants.       And God bless midnight brainstorms, without which I never would have decided that I should go back to where it all started and write a  different  ending this time.
