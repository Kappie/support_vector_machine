One could call it horrible, because I had to get blood drawn (and I'm afraid of needles, called Aichmophobia or Belonephobia), my arm hurts a LOT and I had nothing to eat for 17 hours (admitted, nine of them I was asleep).  I had to get some blood tests done for a doctor. (not elaborating on that one!)  My day could also could be called good, cause I didn't have to go to school, I got to eat Subway (one of my favorite restaurants), and I finally got to see that movie,  Thirteen , which I've been dying to see since forever.  Either way, my arm hurts and I'm tired.   I have found an awesome way to pass time and make my parents ashamed: Wheel of Fortune, the computer game.  I usually win, so it's great.   Right now, my dad's making fun of me because I flinched when the technician came at me with the needle.  What can I say, I have some phobias: Selachophobia, or fear of sharks; being buried alive, or Taphephobia; corpses (I suppose that rules out a career as a mortician), Necrophobia; obviously, injections, Trypanophobia; Vaccinophobia, or fear of vaccinations, and Arachibutyrophobia, peanut butter sticking to the roof of one's mouth (just kiddding on the last one).  For the complete list, including a fear of virgins, go to phobialist.com . I have two good jokes for you.  One may seem a bit weird because it's a blonde joke, and I'm blonde (talk about irony).   The first:      Three women were set to be executed, a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead.  All three chose to be killed by firing squad.  First, the brunette stepped up.  The executioner said, "Ready, aim..." and the brunette shouted, "EARTHQUAKE!!"  The gunmen, distracted, started to panic, and the brunette got away.      The redhead's turn was next.  Taking her cue from the brunette, she shouted, "TORNADO!!!" when it was her turn.      Finally, it was time for the blonde.  She figured out the other two's tricks, and decided to benefit from their idea.  So, the executioner said, "Ready, aim..." and the blonde shouted, "FIRE!!!"  LOL LOL LOL LOL!!!!!!!  The second:      A millionaire was hosting a huge bash at his house, and being a generous person with way too much money, decided to set up a challenge.  He said, "I will give the person who can swim across my pool anything they want.  The catch: it's full of sharks."      Almost instantly, a man leaped into the pool.  All the sharks went to him, but he managed to escape just in time.  Tired and achy, he pulled himself out of the pool.        Being a man of his word, the millionaire said, "Alright, what would you like?"      The man who swam said, "For starters, I'd like the name of the jackass that pushed me in!"  I have a third, but I'll save it for next time, cause I think this entry's long enough.  Later.    Your Energy is Yellow.  You are generous, bright, and expressive. An excellent communicator, you keep your audience captivated with your animated storytelling.  Sometimes you talk too much, but when you learn to listen you will be sought out for your talents to advise.  The communications field appeals to you as a profession.  Public speaking, writing, radio, acting or teaching would also be good career choices.    urlLink   What color is your energy?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
