After wandering in, looking lost, me and a group of people decided to go on the nearest ride to us. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst rides I have ever been on! Claiming to be scary and fun, it turned out to be nothing more then a boring fair ground ghost ride. Highly annoyed and tired from the 2 hour line which we had to queue in to get to the actual rubbish ride, we again, wandered off in a search for a good ride.  Finding no rides with short queues, we went on a boring looking water ride (can't remember the name though), which actually turned out to be quite fun! Damp and cold we then went in search of food, and, with finding a hot dog shop, we bought a hot dog each and walked off, munching happily.   After walking round a couple of shops, we decided to see if we could get on the Shockwave (main rollercoaster) in time for our coach leaving, so we ran across the park as fast as we could and started lining up. After a good half-hour, we finally managed to get on the ride, which turned out to be fantastic! Satisfied at last I made one last stop to buy a toy sword (yes!!! Thats all I went there for really!) and made our way back to the coaches.  So the day turned out ok in the end, at least I got to go on the Shockwave rollercoaster, and got my toy sword! Ta ta for now!
