First, the dying person may become more prayerful and reflective than ever before, reviewing life's journey in gratitude to God, or seeking forgiveness and making amends for wrong. Second, as death approaches, the need to eat and drink is lessened until even an ice cube brushed against the lips is satisfying. Third, persons who are dying often make plans to give their possessions away, making bequests, handing treasures down, providing for favourite charities. Prayer, fasting, and almsgiving: with these three "pillars" of Lent, we rehearse our death every year in this season, and anticipate the final work we will do in this life. And every year, at the end of our journey, is the joy of Easter and the experience of the victory of Christ over death's darkness and power. Annually, we remind ourselves that the Christian experiences the same power and presence at the end of life's journey: Christ to the rescue, and the lasting joy of heaven."  More to come...
