I could stint on ennebreation and emulsify one utterance in complex verbalization that would elongate the sentence to no end, using but a trifling of the massed, nigh-tangible intricacies of the craft. That sentence was only big cuz the words were about three miles long apiece. Damn her.  Wish I had known before I went and wrote about six pages beforehand. Oh well, it'll give you all something to look at and go, "We knew it all along" when they institutionalize me.  Damn it, I like sunflower seeds, they are excellent.  ( These morsels of flower that long only for light and natural benediction taste as ambrosia, tantilizing and enthralling my sense of taste with their Promethian benipulsification . Damn Poe. I just made up a word, if anyone noticed.)
