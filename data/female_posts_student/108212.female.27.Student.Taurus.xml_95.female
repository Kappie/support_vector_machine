If the break up was over something really petty, then it's worth taking the time to work things out. Brian and I always work things out. He doesn't believe in running away from your problems. He doesn't believe in just throwing all that you have worked for away.. Like I said, it depends on the circumstances. I am not going to pry, but you are welcome to elaborate on your situation.. Perhaps then we will be able to give you more suitable advice.
