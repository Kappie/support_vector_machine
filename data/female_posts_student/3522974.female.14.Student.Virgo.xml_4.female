I have worked my butt off this term, I had heaps of study, the infamous camp where SIMBA resides, half yearly exams, assignments and lots of other things i consistently stressed about. However that is all the past now, and i can just live for 3 weeks without any stresses, i hope. It has been 26 hrs since school broke out and i have already found my self stressing about my history project that i accidently left at school, which is due on the second day back. Oh-oh. N eway, the last day of school ran pretty smoothly. I had CPT, where i just scraped in my web site for marking, then maths; most of the time i was being told off by Mrs. Wilson for talking to Hannah. Then, suddenly she disappeared. It was so strange, 1 second she is helping me with a question, i say thnx, then i say "Wait..." and i look up and at the front of the class another teacher said "right, so, how r we going?" Im like, Dude, Where's my...TEACHER?!. Neways, then i went and got a krispy kreme and watched the slave auction for awhile b4 returning to my group. Apparently 2 slaves went for $60! (by one single person). Then in tutor time i had to swap lockers with amanda kiely. Not only did i have to get a bottom locker, but i had to move to the other side of the locker room, leaving all my friendly neighbours behind, to live in a ghetto locker space. Lol. Soon i found out Loz was also stuck in the ghetto, so it got better. After breaking my lock, trying to get it on my new locker, i went to science. My usual teacher was not there instead, i was stuck with Armi. Instead of staying in the classroom and slaving away, gem, ellen and i walked out and decided to find Batsie in the yr7 locker courtyard. (it is so easy cutting class wen u hav armi, she is so blind) He wasn't there but Mrs. Mitchel decided to give us jellybeans for skipping class, excelllent....Whoever said good deeds are rewarded was obviously a priss, because so do bad deeds. When we finally returned to class mrs. Armi was a bit grouchy, so we finished our work and went to english where we watched "Romeo+Juliet". That movie is weird. Afterwards we had the sports elective program so i got dressed and hopped on the bus to go to ice skating. It was heaps fun except for "stumpi"-actually i think he might've made it even funner...hmm... he deserves his own blog. Ne way once i got bak top school the bell went and i was on my way.
