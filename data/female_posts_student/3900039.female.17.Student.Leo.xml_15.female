I haven't had so much fun in a while....well minus the back hurting and hives and rock burnsand all that... Afterwards we went camping with Justine's Mom(remember her?) at Whistler's Bend. Courtney and Christina, my other two best girl friends, came out and hung out with us for a while too but they had to work in the morning so they couldnt stay the night. It has been soo long since we were all together at once. So much laughing(well in Jenna's case, wheezy and snorting)and talking and rambling and nonsense and worrying(mr. grumpy gills...you know who you are). I seriously love you guys so much I just can't even explain! We have to make the most of this last year we have all together... We should mutliply our memories by a gizillion! You're the best I could ever ask for! What will I do without you when we leave for college?
