Your wrong, they only make soap like that because there is a market for it and it sells. Once again, it all comes back to money. Sometimes Capitolism makes me sick.  Tapping Empty Veins  your voice is the color of all you say but when it comes and goes,  it makes hard to know all the subtle-ties that you convey to me  tapping empty veins in a painful way and who else is at stake  as I lay inside of my peace of mind the thoughts I need to condone are the ones I throw are the ones I repress and second guess   tapping empty veins in a painful way and who else is to blame    im probably gunna scrap the 2nd verse.
