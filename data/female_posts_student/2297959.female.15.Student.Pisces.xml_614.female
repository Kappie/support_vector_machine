Hey!      Doesn't a sunset like that just bring you down to your knees   On a moonlit night when everything was right and (.....?)   -----   I'd rather be with you than without   Within you than about you   And I come to find out you want the same   Oh lord I want to breathe you   May my every movement free you   From the place I've kept you locked up all these days   ----   I was wrong to make a country club of my affection   Subjective love for those of my selection   But now she's found someone to love her more than I ever could   You look much better when you smiled   You've been down for quite awhile   Amazed by the change in you   Much that I still won't admit to   What brought about the words in me   Now sees the best in everything   ----
