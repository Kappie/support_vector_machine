Paper cut digits while collating together yesterdays sales reports and payroll woes.  3.  Stain tie with coffee spills from when Net spits out coffee after reading yesterdays sales reports.  4.  Massively click a pen while listening to associates during daily conference calls.  5.  Gain headaches trying to peel off bandaids from fingers which had papercuts.     more to come....
