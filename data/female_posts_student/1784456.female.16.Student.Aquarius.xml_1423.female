I never cry... :P Well I did when I watched The Hours yesterday. It's a really powerful film! I loved it! It really made you care for the characters... you know? Some times you just don't care what happens to them (fine, JUMP!) Hehe... I don't really mean that! (Damn brain) Jeez I'd really freak out if some one did that... even in a movie! I'm always afraid of the invisible enemy. (Mmm hmm. My IQ!)
