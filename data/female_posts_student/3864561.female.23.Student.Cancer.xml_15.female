Regardless, I have decided to stick with it, and kick it off properly by writing a bit about myself.  My name is Rachel, and I'm going to be 23 in....10 days. (Hooray!) I've been married to Rob for two-and-a-half years, and am currently 17 weeks pregnant with our first child. (My first child and the first of his that I know about, anyway.) We also have five cats (yes, 5). I've just finished my first year studying Medical Sciences at Leeds Uni and am taking next year out to have the baby and do maternal-related things. And that's pretty much everything you need to know about me, so I won't bore you any further.
