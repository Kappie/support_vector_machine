Jake gave me a ride back to ceilidh's house. i won't go into detail, but let's just say no one was in a hurry to leave the car.  it was nice. very nice.  ceilidh and sarah made up an insanely elaborate, yet believable, lie about where i was and why i wasn't with them when c's parents came to pick us up. it was ruined when they came into their driveway and they saw me get out of jake's car. ceilidh and sarah yelled out, "holy shit! what the hell?"   oops.  oh well, it was worth it.
