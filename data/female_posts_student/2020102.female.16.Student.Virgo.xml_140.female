"The vague and tenuous hope that God is too kind to punish the ungodly has become a deadly opiate for the consciences of millions." -A.W. Tozer  "A coincidence is a small miracle where God chose to remain anonymous." -Heidi Quade  "Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of infinite importance. The only thing it cannot be is moderately important." -C.S. Lewis
