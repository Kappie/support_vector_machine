I CAN'T TAKE IT . it really is amazing and i wonder if he knows.  so what i do is write in my blog and think of happy things:  -kentesheia scored 10 bucks so we are going to eat a chocolate molten cake from chili's sometime soon. -somebody is playing the piano downstairs right now... ???????????  spot??? -oh wait it's a stupid keyboard. must be dad reminiscing his "ross" days. hehheh. (lol the echos and beat are amazing.) -i made pizza tonight! i think i might make some dischinos too! yum! -lol spot has ran away from my dad's music, but came back to add some sqeeks of her toy.  -tomorrow is friday? -i'm drunk!  alright, enough.
