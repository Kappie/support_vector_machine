The school prom was quite nice, I co-organised it and was proud of my work, Yannick and me did a great job (with offcourse some other people also ) and everyone gave us compliment all night. at 4 we were cleaing up. it was a night to remember. my dress is stilling smelling like beer and sigarets but i really don't care. got a lot of compliments for the dress. it had a quite kinky backpiece and everyone was asking where i kept my other sm-stuff. little pervs :) people are easyly shocked here in little ol' belgium. Today i spent all day waiting at my computer for Pieter to show up. I met him at the prom, he was in one of the bands who came play and we danced all night. he's funny, not very attractive though, but I don't care. I'm not searching for a boyfriend anywayz. Now i just want to have fun and meet new people, get away from home and make sure I actully do what I like and not what people want me to do. It's the beginning of a new era. and now i'm gonna go surfother blogs, relax and maybe get some sleep, and off course wait a little more for Pieter. jeez i feel a bit sad. he's cool though. very straight forward with his questions, it's actually a bit obvious he fansies me. he'll just have to tell me. cuz i don't feel like always being the one who takes the fist step. BUT wait, that's just unlogical, i don't even want him. god, i should take a break from myself. anyone in for a body-swap?
