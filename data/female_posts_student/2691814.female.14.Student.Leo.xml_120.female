We orderd pizza cuz we were starving, plus i knew that deidra had to eat soon cuz of her hypoglucimia (can't spell) yep, then after a few more hours she left. Then Cindy came over *yay* and started playing the guitar(yes i got it back!!!) Then she left after helping us pack summor boxes. Then after everything was packed up and vaccumed and cleaned, got in the car and drove off, pangy in the back seat and key in her cage in the truck. We drove for 2 hours, and the whole time i listend to Yellowcard over and over.Yes i was sad , Empty Apartment gets me everytime lol. We stopped at gas stations maybe twice. We came to this city, smaller than Orlando for sure, but it was pretty. I look out the window and I see a small tan house. Big driveway, a white mail box. I didn't say anything, i was silent. And before i even went in the house i met some skaters, they were actually nice people, some were going to Riverview(the highschool i'll be going to) and some were in keiths grade. So I walked into the house and everything was tile...very cold. You could tell it was still a new house because of the paint smell(which i love) lol. But, it was lonely. It didn't look 'alive' as some would say. So we tried to unpack most of the truck. I fell asleep for about 5 mins, i was freezing and really tired. I had to take a shower but the water was like ice. I made my bed and because i was so cold I put on a sweatshirt. During the night my parents had to make sure i was still alive because they said that i looked like i wasn't breathing. (weird) but, oh well.  Our cable is hooked up and i dont have any of my spooky channels. Travel, and AND I DON'T HAVE FUSE!!!!!!!!! I seriously love that channel and im so mad that i dont have it,grrrr. but, oh well, i can deal. >Im not going to die with out it lol I'm still freezing, and im wearing a sweatshirt. I've been playing my guitar alot and i've gotten better at it...i can finally play that song that ryan tought me over the phone without messing up! YAY. haha, and this one girl is still on this one subject and she wont get over it lol, its really funny if you know who im talking about.  okay, so i guess thats it.
