I'm typing it now... (And I've kind of forgot what the other two were about) Ahh, I'll just keep going and hopefully meet an elephant along the way *or a point... a point would be good* Geez, that's getting a bit too optomistic if you ask me! Uhh... failing that I'll erm go away and leave you to wonder about the point of this *and life* on your own, sorry! (I know it's tough without me, but I'll be back tomorrow) Oh, and don't wait up for me next week, I'm gonna be a bridesmaid!!! YEayyyy! (Which means Tuesday-Friday off of school) Ahh, there is a God! *and he's smiling at me*
