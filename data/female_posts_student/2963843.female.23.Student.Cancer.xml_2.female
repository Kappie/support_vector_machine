My ex bf 'D'called me to ask me out for coffee as he was around my place while working... He's doing sales now..  GOd.. the nerve he has.. I really have no idea.. I'm so surprised! I never thought he'll call me... Since we both broke up in a very messy manner, I thought maybe he felt bad and wanted to be friends.. But I don't think I'll meet him.. thank you very much.. Its just all very awkward for me..   I'm also facing some racial issues among my project mates.. But there is really some misunderstanding.. Why do some people from minority races think that we put them down for their skin color, when what we are unhappy about is their working attitudes? If they say we are being racist, then aren't they being the same for categorising themselves when we have never thought about that ourselves? ANyway I do not care anymore that I have to kiss other people's asses to make them feel better.. I have to take care of my own.. That's life... Food for thought.. I have to learn to protect myself and not be made used of.. I have to learn not to be worried about other people's feelings when they have no regard for mine..  Anyway I'm going to sleep now.. Tomorrow is another project day.. Nite =)
