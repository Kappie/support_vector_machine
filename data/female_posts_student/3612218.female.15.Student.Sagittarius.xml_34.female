Nurses and doctors were really nice people, I spent most of my time there talking to them. I know all of them there. So fun to be joking around with them. Haha. Well, the food was delicious. But, I seriously have no appeitite to eat. Oh, not forgetting to mention. I learnt alot too. Bio knowledge. And guess what i told them? I told them to wait for me for 10years, I will be back as a doctor. The first thing I do is to drop by the ward and say hi. (((:  Not forgetting to mention everyone who showed care and concern for me. I really love you guys lots. Now, I do know who my true friends are. Thanks guys! ((: I shall not mention names here in case I forget some. ((: U guys know who you are.  I know I shouldn't be blogging bout this ----> but I really miss you alot. (I hate myself when I start to blog bout this, I really hate myself.)  I clearly know that I'm suppose to get over it and move on to the better or rather normal world of my own but I cant. I really don't know why. I'm so affected by you and everything about you. And even in the hospital, someone just had to remind me of you. I think of you every now and then. God, give me a sign. Tell me what to do? What exactly am i suppose to do? Tell me.. Sometimes I think to myself, can you dont be so nice. Can you be nasty and get attached to some ppl so I can jolly well kill myself. The other part of me, tells me that I dont wan all this to be happening cuz my heart will crashed. I want you to be like before. Give me back my 4 weeks, I want them back. I want you back. -though its highly impossible-  Im not as strong as you think I am. Well, that's just too bad. Right?  I'm gonna get a stern scolding from my friends who knows that Im still feeling this way but I cant help it. I really wished I could. Really wished I could just forget and move on. I have to. Give me some time. I will. I need to study hard for my O's. Its just around the corner. O's is what that leads to my future. I dont want to lose this chance. And Im not goin to let myself stay this way. I will change, I will study. I will do everything I'm suppose to do instead of ... I will.  I promise...    Special thanks to Leqi who was helping me all these while. Thanks alot for everything. I can't exactly tell you all this verbally. So I shall thank you here. Thanks sweetie! I know what Im suppose to do. I will ok. Really! (((:  To my "girlfriend", thanks for being there for me. You'll be my best bud alright. Thanks babe. U ought to move on too. Right? Let's move on together. Mwahahhaha.. Take care.
