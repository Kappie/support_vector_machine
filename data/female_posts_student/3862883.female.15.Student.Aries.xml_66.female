In the beginning, you meet the main character, Cap. Willard, who in the book is represented as captain Marlow. Both of these characters are sent on basically the same mission,(Marlow is sent by a business Manager that employed Kurtz, and Cap. Willard who is sent by the military to assassinateKurtz)to go after the same person; Kurtz (a character in the book, as well as the movie), and it for very similar reasons. These similarities are key to the story, both in the book and the movie, because it establishes the long and dangerousjourney that Marlow andCap. Willard must go through in order to findKurtz, who is hidden deep into the tretcherus jungles ofAfrica/Vietnam.
