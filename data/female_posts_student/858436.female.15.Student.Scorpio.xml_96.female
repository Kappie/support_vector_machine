Sure, I'd heard of them before, but after watching "I Love the 90s" and hearing how awesome they were, I decided to check them out on AOL. How awesome! And I found out that "Wonderwall" by Ryan Adams is actually a cover of their song. The Ryan Adams version is beautiful, but the Oasis is way cool. :-D  Hm.. today we painted Virginia's room! Next we're doing mine. Buh bye ugly brown paneling.   Tomorrow - working and painting. Fun. Someone please call me and ask to do something!! I'm going insane. Goodson - where in the world are you?! I've called like, 3 times and no one is there. And last night your phone was busy forever! I finally went to bed haha.  John Mayer concert next Wednesday.. still don't have anyone to come with me. I hope I can find someone before tickets are sold out, because I would definitely be upset. If not, he'll be in Nashville on August 27th, but still. I want to see him NOW! Haha.   Guess that's it. This it the 8th time I've listened to "Wonderwall" today. Haha.
