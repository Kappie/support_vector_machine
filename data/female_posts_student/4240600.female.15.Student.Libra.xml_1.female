I don't know why I feel like this...I just do.      Anyway, my parents let me stay home alone (as in without supervision) overnight for the first time, my mom said she always knew I'd be fine, but *she* worries about me a lot, and wasn't sure if she could handle it...she wasn't sure if my grandma would approve, so I told her to go through with it, and then tell her after it's already been done.  I suppose it *is* a little underhanded, but the last thing I want is for my grandma to worry.      I borrowed Lys' Final Fantasy VIII so I could finish the game, but my playstation isn't letting me play it...it's really starting to get on my nerves.      I'm going to see Norah Jones in concert on the 30th...I can't wait.  Oh, and my elementary school reunion is the 28th, I really want to see all my old friends, so I'm excited for it.
