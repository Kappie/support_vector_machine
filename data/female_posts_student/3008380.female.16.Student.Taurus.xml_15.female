Except we'll be there with the frickin' Bearcats....what the hell is a Bearcat anyway? Some sort of an animal rape gone wrong without emergency contraception?  At lunch today, I stole Kyle's Reeses. I thought he saw me do it, but I tell ya what, that boy can be blind sometimes. Or maybe it's with all males. They seem to only hear what they want to hear. You can say something extremely important, and they won't hear you unless whatever you say contains the words "boobs," "football," or "he was so big." Then again, when you're screaming it helps too. Now, I'm not saying this goes for the entire male species, I'm just saying...some are pretty dense.  As well as females too though. They listen TOO much! It's like you say "I want a fishing tank" and they are like "Did you just call me a dirty skank???" My Lord! But whatever, I don't care much for either species.  I'm not saying that I'm A-sexual or anything, I mean, my god, I do have a boyfriend. But it just amazes me how blonde the human race can be. I'll check in later when I'm bored again...
