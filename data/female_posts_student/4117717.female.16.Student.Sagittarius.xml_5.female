I mean, here I am taking nasty cough syrup and afterwards I have to have a spoon full of just sugar right afterwards....I think that would make me gag. Ew, gross, its realy getting to me now. But do you know what? You know that scene in Mary Poppins when she is singing that song and she puts her fingers out and the little bird (only later did I realize it was MECHANICAL) hops onto her finger and starts like..singing..with her?....Yeah ever since I was little I've thought if I hold my fingers out just like Mary Poppins a bird will come onto my finger and start singing and not like peck my eyes out. When I was little I used to go running around places holding my fingers out like that near the birds, but they'd always fly away : (...My Mary Poppins dream has yet to come true. Actually I haven't tried it in awhile, so maybe a bird will come now. ...Hmmm.......I mean, Mary Poppins WAS older, but I am older then I was the first time I tried it. Alright, I'll try it tomorrow. ...If it's not raining....and if there are birds...and if they aren't ugly birds, cause who wants an ugly bird on your finger singing?  Ok sorry I went off on a rant. Specifically a Mary Poppins rant. Which I am quite sure NONE of you can say that you went off on such a rant.  Um, anyways...I realized that when I get really bitterly jealously mad at something I get really hyper. And go off on such tangents like the Mary Poppins one. Even though I belive that one was just waiting inside me to come out. Cause it is true about the bird story. I still want that to happen and would totally freak out and scare the bird to death if that ever happened. Man, I hope someone is around me when that happens, cause I want to get a picture and it framed and all...Even though the flash from the camera may upset the bird. Ok, so no flash cameras it is. And it has to be during the day anyways....Cause I mean, birds dont sing at night. Maybe I should resemble Mary Poppins? Maybe all birds have seen the movie Mary Poppins and will only sing to someone like her?...Ok so get Julie Andrews on the phone, tell her to send me a wig and costume and I'm all set.  Kate Schnebly will be transformed intoooo....MARY POPPINS. Dude, I hope she sends me that bag too that had that really tall stuff in it. Like..a lamp. Who doesn't want a lamp coming out of their bag???? That'd be great. ...I think she also had like a yard stick. I mean, that's just practical...you always need a yard stick in your bag to measure little children. What if a little kid comes up to you and says "how tall am I?" and you aren't prepareded???? My god, that child would be scarred for life.  OH AND THE UMBRELLA! Who needs a car when you have that umbrella? Sure it may be a little....weird...and you might get hit by a plane or something but I mean...its a pretty handy umbrella. And you can go as fast as you want to. No umbrella cops to stop you!  Ok. I am ending the Mary Poppins rant....rightt.........OH MY GOD! And that whole...Chalk world or something...you know they go into the chalk sidewalk? With that guy who had the whole band attached to him? And they go on cartoon horses? And the horses have such human like features with the emoitions on their faces and all?....Actually I think that would freak me out. A horse having more expressions then me would just be ...too much. Ok I think in general if a horse had really noticable eyebrows it would freak me out. And they went up and down a lot...Ok I am just starting a nightmare for me.  ....I just had a sudden urge to watch Pochonathous. Hah, I totally did not spell that right. ...with that little...singing ....raccoon or something. And that pissed off humming bird. And that fat dog who had a little...hat on or something.  OK ENOUGH DISNEY!  I'm ending this now.
