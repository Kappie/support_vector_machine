I gotta say, though, as frightening as they are, I love 'em.  Especially Kyo, Shinya and Toshiya.  They're damn cool.  I can't say that I'd feel safe being in the same room as Kyo, ya know, with all the vomiting and the bleeding and the raping and the S obsessions...but he's still damn cool despite his rather peculiar lyrics and videos.  Check 'em out.  Excellent music.  Very talented young lads.
