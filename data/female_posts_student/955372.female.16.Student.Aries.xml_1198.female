Why can't she have a real job where she works everyday. I probably should have stayed home and just stayed in my room all day. But she'd come up eventually. My headache is bad enough, the last thing I need is to spend the day with my mother. *shudder* I'll stay home next tuesday. Hopefully Noelle will stay home then too and we can go out to breakfast, like I was planning to do today. Damn parents ruin everything.
