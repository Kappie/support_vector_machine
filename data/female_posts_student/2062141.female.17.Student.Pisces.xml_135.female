She thinks, "Hey, how did I come to this?" I dream myself a thousand times around the world But I can't get out of this place. There's an emptiness inside her And she'll do anything to fill it in But all the colors mix together - to grey And it breaks her heart How she wishes it was different She prays to God most every night And though she swears it doesn't listen There's still a hope in her it might She says "I pray But they fall on deaf ears, am I supposed to take it on myself? To get out of this place? " There's lonliness inside her And she'll do anything to fill it in And though it's red blood bleeding from her now It feels like cold blue ice in her heart When all the colors mix together - to grey And it breaks her heart There's a stranger speaks outside her door Says take what you can from your dreams Make them as real as anything It'd take the work out of courage But she says "Please There's a crazy man that's creeping outside my door, I live on the corner of Grey Street And the end of the world. " There's an emptiness inside her And she'll do anyrthing to fill it in And though it's red blood bleeding from her now It's more like cold blue ice in her heart She feels like kicking out all the windows And setting fire to this life She could change everything about her Using colors bold and bright But all the colors mix together - to grey And it breaks her heart It breaks her heart To Grey   I'm so pissed. I just wrote so much and then I accidently clicked off the window and it was all ERASED. Wow between when I wrote that sentence and now it was like an hour cause I called Charlotte. So now I feel like writing again. OH SHIT i have to edit my video!!!!
