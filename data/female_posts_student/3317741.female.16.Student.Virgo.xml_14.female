Hoping and praying it will not be torn apart If ever this love proves not to be true He'll leave with something belonging to you A part of your heart forever he'll take You will get over this, for your own sake  After all, you must still go on  For it is not your whole heart that is gone Many believe in love at first sight If you find that someone, hold on tight  Work on the relationship to make it grow And in time you will know If this is the love, you've waited your life for You will never want or need... anything more
