It's a comfortable life these days, just eating and lounging around and doing minimal homework, but then I wonder where this is getting me. Nowhere is the obvious answer, but I'm too ignorant to accept it.  My mind wanders when I play piano. I don't like the carpeting in the living room for the Bach (undeniably picky of me). I start playing Szymanowski and somehow the pedaling cuts the phrases apart and I think of Nick: in January, this was his song. And then somehow I start thinking of Adam Borelli's girlfriend from long ago: I think she was a 1600 who went to TO and came to Westlake to talk to some kids about Harvard. I remember her watching one of our trials one year and I couldn't help but marvel at the fact that she was both Chinese and sophisticated at the same time. Good Asian girls don't get boyfriends, usually. But some manage, I suppose. I was reading threads about prep school, and I thought of a term paper quote that begins like this:   "She can be seen imagining what might have become of her if..."  What if I went to prep school, or even Viewpoint? Would I wear skirts and interact with guys who have their collars turned up? In a twisted way, I think ha, they have higher admissions rates to colleges. But then again, what kind of life is that? In ways, I'm glad I don't go to an excessively high-powered school otherwise I'd be crushed.  Bah, college. What am I thinking? Lots.
