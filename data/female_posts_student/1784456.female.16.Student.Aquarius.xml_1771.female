Oh well... tis worth it to spread the love! :P *yeeeeah* And everything went with the old layout... where's my weather pixie?!?!?! Oh and the little pink tag board went as well but I get to do less clever work now so I'm happy! Yeay back to vegetive state! Woohoo! Oh, and I'll make it so anyone can comment *no swearing, and we know about five languages so no foreign swearing!* And I'm as crazy and stressed as ever! Yeay! I actually should get a revamp in my head one of these days... hmm maybe after my mid-life crisis I'll consider it. Woohoo for lack of spell check!
