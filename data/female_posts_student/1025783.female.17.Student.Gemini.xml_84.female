For faith brings us upon the boundary of this unthinkable pleasure Makes us question who we are, what morals we live upon If longevity were to become obsolete, infinity would prosper What time would be treasured, what memories replenished At the end of the day- you have to ask yourself Would eternal youth really be a thing of beauty Or an afterthought that holds us in the prisons of our souls.
