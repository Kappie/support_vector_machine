I was really depressed at school yesterday, and didn't have the greatest day. I didn't do as well on my exams as I had hoped(Note to self: never again break up with your boyfriend right before exam week. I spent more time crying and writing depressing poetry than studying. I'm pathetic).  Oh, wait, back up a second. Yeah, I broke up with my boyfriend. Communication had died off a bit, and, it seems, his infatuation with me had done the same. It was my fault, I've been an emotional basketcase lately and hadn't put near enough effort into the realationship. So, I wrote him a note, relating my feelings on the matter. I told him that if he saw anything between us worth saving, we needed to talk. But otherwise, he should just let me know, and we would let it go.  Without letting me know, he seems to have chosen the second. So, with that stress, as well as everything related in my last post, summer has looked worse than ever. And now, on the first day, I am home alone, at 10 AM, with my scrambled eggs and coffee, listening to a heavy rainfall. And I wonder what I am going to do with myself for the rest of summer.  A copy of "Mere Christianity" sits on the desk next to me. In Book IV, Chapter 8, CS Lewis explains that in the Christian life, the real problem comes the moment you wake up each morning(and I have only been awake for an hour). "All your wishes and hopes for the day rush at you like wild animals" Lewis writes, "And the first job each morning consists of simply shoving them all back; in listening to that other voice, taking that other point of view, letting that other larger, stronger, quieter life come flowing in. And so on, all day. Standing back from all your natural fussings and frettings, coming in out of the wind."  I still have no idea what I am going to do this summer. But I know that, with all this free time, I am going to do my best to let Christ lead me. If, from the moment I wake each morning these two and a half months, I try to live for Christ, and let Christ live through me, maybe it is a habit I wil be able to carry into the more busy months after mid-August. I think it's something worth aiming for.
