Then I would sit down and two seconds later - the phone would ring.  This went on for a couple of minutes!!  I wasn't exactly feeling up to par yesterday either.  I was a bit under the weather for some odd reason.  All I wanted to do was lie in my bed all day.  I was really tired too and I kept thinking about everything that I am worried about.  I did watch another movie last night too.  I watched The Missing but it was really boring.  I think today I might do some review for Bio and make sure my Drama project is ready to go, because he is such a hard marker.  This morning I kept thinking about Habits of Mind.  Kept wondering why I wasn't nominated.  As much as I say to everyone that I am over the fact, the truth is it still bothers me that no one nominated me.  I just don't understand why not.  Of course life is not fair, and that is just the way it is going to be.  However, I felt like I put in so much effort last semester.  More effort then I have ever put in.  That is why it leaves me so stumped, confused, and puzzled.  It leaves me in questioning.  Now since I wasn't nominated I use tutorials way less these days and I feel as if though no one notices that I work hard.  I'm sure lots of people do know that I work hard, but I don't think they see it or know how hard.  Maybe that is why no one nominated me.  I'm hoping that Swain will give me a nomination though because I feel like I am working so hard in A. Living and I know that he can see that.    I am not sure as for Bio though because I study a lot at home, and try to understand the material but have not gone to any tutorials.  That is only because I understand the info though, that is why.  I don't think she would nominate me again this year though.  I don't feel like I have anything special or stand out.  Of course that is slightly being negative towards myself and doubting myself, which I should not do because I am better than that.  The most important thing I learned from LaCour was to not to doubt myself because it's demeaning and degrading, if you think you can do something and believe in yourself, it's likely anything is possible.
