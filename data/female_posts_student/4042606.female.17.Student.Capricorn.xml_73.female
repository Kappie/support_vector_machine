The game was so bad thatI actually died a little inside as I was watching it. The only reason I was having fun was because I was hanging out with a friend, otherwise it would have been a total waste of time. Also listening to that dumbass  Tarheel  behind me spouting off about how the  Expo's  were going to win, which they were clearly not going to. It even got to the point where Krystal betChad a dollar a run that the Expo's would lose. Chad now owes Krystal a good deal of money.We finally decided to leave at the 9th inning because the game just got unbearably sucky.
