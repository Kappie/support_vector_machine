I was just so used to him calling me everyday that when he didn't call in 2 days I was just weirded out. But he's good to me. He called me a total of 8 times yesterday! wow. and today he called while he was on his way to Nashville (he was taking $3 million dollars to Nashville...$3 MILLION!) damn. i think i'm in like with him. ha. He's a cutie. I'll keep him. He makes me all girly. hhehe.  I'm out bitches, cuz i have to wash my car because SOMEONE chalked it. damn. this car war thing is getting annoying now. I'm getting sick of having to wash my car everyday. peace out.
