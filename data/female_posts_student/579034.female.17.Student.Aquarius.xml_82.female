The one the good thing I got outta it was my own Armory "OH!" and my pitty clap.... yeah right I wanted to kill myself, figures I pick one of the biggest meets of the season to fall. I got pretty scraped up from the track (I left my mark on the track, ha ha!)... I went to the medics and afyer he cleaned me up I went to leave and when I pushed off my hand to get up and my wrist really hurt. So me and Melissa are walking back and I go "Ya know, my wrist kinda hurts." and Meliss told me to go back and check it out. The he did a test and told me I might of fractured it and for Melissa to go get coach cause I have to go to the ER for an X-Ray. I was pretty bad, cryin a bit. I  was just asking over and over if I would be able to run next week. Coach said she wasn't mad about the race so that was okay but, I was syill upset. So one wild walk to the ER later and after calling my parents, Coach and I waited for my dad to come and when he did I got called in for testing. An hour and a half later I was told it looks like either a hairline fracture or the way my bone is growing in. So, they put me in this like semi-hard cast and told me to make an appointment for next week. Good thing is I can still run, thank God. Well that was my day. Fun, right? Thing is I like tripped over myself ya know? There was no one in front of me, not too far behind me and I wasn't near the metal edge of the track, so I musta tripped ovewr myself, right? Well, typin w/ one hand is gettin hard so I'm out x0x.
