There was a whole bunch of shredded paper in his locker, and I was kicking the trash can back to it's place, and it was really loud and Chris and Brandon told me to stop kicking it because there were lessons going on. I did, but I was trying to see if I could kick it quietly first, and I guess they took that as, "oh, she didn't hear," and Chris I guess said, "oh, she's blind AND deaf." I don't know. I just got REALLY REALLY mad at him after that. Seriously, Chris of all people. He knows how much I absolutely detest people who do that to me. It's not like I can help not being able to see perfectly. It's not like it was my choice. I didn't say, "Hey God, I want to have really poor vision that can't be corrected...please!!"  I mean, I don't think I'm really upset with him anymore just...I don't know. It made me really dissapointed that he'd do that to me.   But yeah, other than that I guess my day was ok. That just kind of ruined it sort of. I know it's bad to let one thing someone said get to you THAT much, but I guess it's just because it came from someone I wouldn't have expected to say that.   Ugh, I am still annoyed about it now that I'm writing about it. I probably shouldn't have written about it. Oh well.   I think jazz this year may actually be ok. We're actually going to have sectionals too, every Thursday so hopefully that will make us better.   I guess I should go read more of Gatsby now. It's surprisingly a pretty good book.
