Remember, if you are bleeding, I'm not there to take you to the Emergency Room, so you will have to manage it on your own! HA! Don't worry, I can hold the fort down while you are gone and keep the little ones(Tina, Court, and Justine) from quareling too much. Well hopefully I will do better than I did when you went to Costa Rica... hehe. THAT was a nightmare. I love you tons, have a good time!
