And oh my godda she is staying the night with me in a hotel *wink Wink* Naw nothing will happen unless she makes it happen. Because I am not sure where she stands with she and i "being" together.But hey if we can have each other saturday then the next chance we have to "be" together will be my b-day when i go to see her I am so exicted though just to spend time with her. I LOVE YOU SWEETHEART
