Then she talked to Ryan on the internet while I painted and everything. Then her dad got here. After she left I painted my paint by number thing. I like it. Then I got in the shower because I had to get ready for a graduation. It was Rachel Bahler's. She is really pretty and SO nice. She starts work at Pick 'N Save Tuesday I think. I used my sunless tanning lotion and I'm going to use it for a while now because I want to get tan before our graduation on next Monday. After the graduation I came home and made lunch. Kristine came over and I showed her my ugly face on our home video. Then my parents came home (they went to another graduation after they dropped me off) for a few minutes. Kristine left then and I started painting again. I also hung out with my parents and got in an arguement with my brother. After that my parents went to a wedding reception. Then I called Desire` and asked her if she would call Mr. Flanagan to ask him a question for me and now she keeps calling me a chicken. She called him but he wasn't home so... it wouldn't work! Then she went to her dad's and she called me to tell me that she couldn't get ahold of Mr. Flanagan. Then she decided she was going to go run at the track and I went with her. So did Mitchel. On our way out of the track a cop stopped us and I was on her crutches and the cop goes... did you guys just come from the track and Desire` goes yeah. The cop was like what were you doing and we were like running and he points to me and goes even you and I'm like oh I don't need these crutches I just use them for fun. So then her dad came over to pick her up and so now I'm inside typing this. Oh and all the teachers at school now know that Desire` gets high. That's a story for another day though.
