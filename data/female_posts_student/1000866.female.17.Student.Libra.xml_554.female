It kind of made me think and realize things that I had just avoided in the past. I don't know. I'm trying to be upbeat and not let things bother me. I know this will come as a shock but that's something I'm trying to do for New Years. It's not working out so well...  Oh well. I guess I am allowed to have my weak/bad moments. I mean, I can't very well stop them all.   'Cause out there somewhere, it's all waiting if you keep believing.  Out there somewhere, daylight finds you, if you keep believing.
