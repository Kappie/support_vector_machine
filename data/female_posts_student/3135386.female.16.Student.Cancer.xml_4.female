(Insert eyeroll) I can't even remember how it came up now. (Update: Will has just informed me that it stared with Sarah calling me whats-her-nuts and so she (Will) decided I should be called Nutsy like the vulture off of the cartoon Robin Hood. Nothing like friends to give you self confidece.)  Today's been a slow day. I couldn't believe it; when I woke up this morning, it was snowing. SNOWING!! It's the middle.of.flipping.MAY!!  I'm still on the countdown until I leave for Brazil. Only 49 more days. (Give or take since I'm still unsure of when I go.) It's starting to feel more real now. I've spoken to Maju (going by her IM name BTW ^_^) I've been studying my portuguese dictionary. I've been to the orientation...got my Canada jacket that identifies me as an Rotary exchange student. I feel so proud to wear it. *wipes away a tear*  Messing around on Windows Media Player until I think it's time to get ready for Karate. Must remember to iron my gi also. Debating whether to stick with Media player or go to Winamp, or what ever it's called. Cara and AJ were bugging me about it. (Damn techies...)
