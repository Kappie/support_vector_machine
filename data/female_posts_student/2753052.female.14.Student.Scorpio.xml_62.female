Today I went to the ice cream place to see if the damn manager was in and there were these stupid spanish construction workers there and i asked if the manager was in and they said no and then this really obnoxious guy was like, "But I am" and all of them started laughing like HAHAHAHA HOLY FUCK I WANTED TO KICK HIM IN THE BALLS! I was already in a bad mood because my younger sister is so mean and I was looking forward to shopping with her and my aunt tomorrow and then my sister decided she didn't want me to come. I didn't even do anything to her she just said no i don't want laura there. Thanks. I'm so mad....  *breathes*
