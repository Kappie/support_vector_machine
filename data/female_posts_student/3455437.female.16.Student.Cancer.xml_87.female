But Jurassic 5, Ozomatli, 1200 techniques and Sneaky Sound System were my faves. I haven't been online in sooooo long. Checked my emails twice in the last fortnight- both times at Joelles.  Tuesday=really really shit day (both extension subjects) AND $1 movie night at Video Ezy (which we all just love don't we grrrrrr stupid new rule about having to have ID cards grrrrrrr).
