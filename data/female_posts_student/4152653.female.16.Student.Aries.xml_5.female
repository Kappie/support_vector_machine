"Only three to five more weeks. Well, unless he gets infected again."        so, sorry art boy, it really is a shame that your girlfriend's upset, but this week i'm more worried for my friend whose blood is trying to kill him.   get your head out of your ass and realize that there's real pain in this world. don't put yourself in danger- there are some who don't have a choice.
