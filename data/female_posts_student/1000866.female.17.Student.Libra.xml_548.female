Being packed in a car with Christopher, Matthew, Stephen, Jim, and Matt was really quite funny.  2. I got new fuzzy pants from the gap. They're so soft, and comfy. I love them. :) I know I'm probably not supposed to love inanimate objects but really, I think it's ok once in a while.   3. I drove a lot of places today including the mall...where I GOT MY FUZZY PANTS WHICH I LOVE!   So, really, my day has been good. I just am sort of...I don't know. I don't really know anything.
