I need my G2s to be able to go to University... (Oh, and I went for my G1s last week, and of course passed...) So, next week, I can't work at the summer camp at the stables. And they haven't asked me for this week - I'm pissed. I'll tell them I'm available in August... -_-  Also received my report card - was surprised, got 76% on Physics exam. Maybe I should have taken Physics next year instead of Chemistry (in which I only got 69% on exam. Which, for me, is low. I expect of myself a minimum of 75%.)  French: 89% (note on exam: 85%) Biology: 90% (note on exam: 90%) Chemistry: 71% (note on exam: 69%) Physics: 76% (note on exam: 76%)  You'll notice that in biology and physics, the exam is the same grade as my final note. >.>  In French and Chemistry however, the exam results are lower than my final grade. Amusing - I expected the contrary.
