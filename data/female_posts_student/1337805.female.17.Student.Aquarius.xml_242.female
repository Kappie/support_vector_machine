Best part about that tho, was seeing Nick in a white shirt (drool) and taking several (actaull) naps with him later...Delicious.   Monday and Tuesday I watched Ayla..nothing huge...Wrote a test after school on Wednesday cause I accidently skipped that class (an actual accident too), got timetables on Wednesday too, biked to Saanichton, watched Ayla. Thursday was special day, biked over to Nick's after school, had..urhm..fun :) It was our three month anniversary thing then...pretty special. Friday, went to the park for a bit with everyone, and then went to Nick's....had more...urhm...fun :) and then went out to see Day After Tomorrow, but...we didnt get there in time. Stupid buses coming early. And we were too late to see Stepford Wives, so we saw Shrek 2....which was actaully very good. Best thing about that, was when we were coming home, we were charged the Adult Fare on the bus..:P Hehe!   Anyways, off to the park today. And to go see Harry Potter later with Laura. And to do Earth science work, cause Kaitlin wants that done by like....tomorrow..(crap..>
