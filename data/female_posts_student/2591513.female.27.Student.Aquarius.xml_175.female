That is how often we see our dad...but we aren't used to it, not really...because if we were then it wouldn't hurt so much when he leaves.  I love my dad and miss him terribly.  I think this was hard because I saw him with the kids and he was the papa we grew up with and love, not the one from a couple years back.  He was focused on us and did things with us.  It is a really long story and quite too personal to go into...yes, there are some things I will not rant about.  I just had a very good time with my dad and I remember now why he is such an integral part of our family.  No one can piss us off or make us laugh quite like he can and he sure does bring new meaning to generosity.  The papa I love came back home and stayed for a month, the stranger and it was good.  I have to go to bed now because my butt is going to drive an hour away to catch a big tent sale on base (Ha, you know it is one of my perks in the military life.)
