So I am ending up just going to Harry Potter 3 with my grandparents for my real birthday. But it'll be fun because I don't spend as much time as I would like with them. Them being really my only relitively sane relations. Oh but my grandma has me go to Herburgers where she works to pick out my birthday present and I went yesterday and I found this braclet and this lime green wallet which rocks so much! And I get to go celebrate my birthday/ fathers day tonight with my mom's side of the family. I got to have the party for April/May/June, which includes my birthday, with my dad's side of the family on Sunday night. I guess I like my birthdays to be like this so that I am not the center of attention where I get fliped out. Yeah so more presents for me! Ha ha I am so (word that starts with a c which I forgot but would be perfect in this situation). And I don't have to go to drivers ed tomorrow but I have to get up even earlyer then I usually do to go to an orthadontist appointment, now won't that be fun! In a perfect world I could then come home and go back to  sleep but I have never been able to do that. Hummm...it's gonna suck! But really what can you do. Something else I was going to tak about...hummm...can't remember...OH well I'll rember later when I rember that c word. Hummm...a three second memory span really isn't good. Yeah well I have stuff to do for drivers ed and have to practice. Bye!
