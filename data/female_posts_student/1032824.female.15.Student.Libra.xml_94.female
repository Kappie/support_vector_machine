That is why I believe that it is essential to count our blessings and remind ourselves constantly of how lucky we are. Even if it is as simple as having a roof over our heads, it should not be taken for granted. Take the earth quake in Iran for example. Although it did not affect us, Singaporeans, greatly, we should think of the less fortunate, feel for them, and we even can do our part by praying for them. Thus, I have decided to create a  urlLink blog  whereby I write down 3 blessings a day. It is a a great way for all of us to get into the habit of counting our blessings and appreciating life. I sincerely hope you all will join me in doing it.
