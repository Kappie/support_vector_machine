I'm getting drowned in loud posh -owchie my head hurts- guitar music *from the PC* (No really... I'm being serenaded by a guy who's hidden in my PC) *ahhh that guy...* EH? Aha... must be the paint fumes I guess. Yes, I painted the fence! Woohooo! If you walked down the alley past our house you could have seen me painting the fence! *Please God don't let any one have seen me* Hehe... not like I was wearing the most embarrassing clothes or anything... ehe... Mmm... carrots. They should be the new snack! Mmm... carrots in a bag! Aaargh I have to go! *and weren't we having fun?* Bisi.
