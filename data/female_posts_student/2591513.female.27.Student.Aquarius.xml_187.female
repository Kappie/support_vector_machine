It is sad sometimes, but I know that she loves her grandmother and that they will have a good relationship, kind of like the one I had with my own grandma before they hauled her off to NJ.  No offense to those who live in Jesrsey...but I hate NJ...okay, I hate Piscataway.  After 10 years with my grandmother, she was taken and I only got to see her once after that.  Then another time to be at her funeral.  I was never closer to any one of my other grandparents, so losing her was a blow.  I think of Alzheimers and think of all the memories and time it had robbed my family.  It really does leave the family with a great whole in their hearts and in their lives because they go to see their loved ones and see that the soul has gone dim and that the person they love and know are now reduced to an empty shell.  I hope my kids never have to experience Alzheimers.  I am sorry for the gloomy bog today.  I had a rough night with the baby.  She cried all night long looking for my mom who happened to be gambling at Pechanga.  Oh there was nothing I could do to comfort her, so she cried herself to sleep.  It didn't help that I took my migraine medicine and so I wasn't feeling all that great.  The other night I thought about my friends and how different our lives have become.  It is interesting, but I am happy with my life.  I do sometimes envy their success, but I have brought some beautifully intelligent little people into this world and know that when they will do great things in life.  My life has been blessed and will continue to be great as long as I stay focused on the things I have and not the things I want.  I was looking at old pictures...life was so simple back then...maybe not, there were still some issues, some serious issues, but at a whole, it was a little more carefree.  I better get going, have to take mom to Camp Pendleton to get her bowling ball.  Have a Happy Friday and great weekend if I don't get to post on here again.
