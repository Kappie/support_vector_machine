Nine months after such events reports about "baby booms" in local hospitals invariably appear in the media.    In our case, these reports appeared in August 2003, in the hours and days after the power came back on.  I saw a report on our local news channel last night, however, indicating that the media had contacted various local hospitals and discovered that the number of babies being born in the maternity ward right now are actually less than is normally expected for this time of year.   urlLink Snopes  has a good article refuting this common myth as well.    urlLink    Photo of the Toronto skyline during Blackout 2003 by Mike Nowland    urlLink     More to come...
