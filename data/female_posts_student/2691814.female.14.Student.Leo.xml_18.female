Yep it was terrible alright..the day went by to fast and i stayed inside. I know your thinkin..whats she doin inside?..Well i'll tell you, I was on the internet reading depressing poetry..writing poetry and wrote more poetry...Yep that wa my day...but then i went outside. Cindy and Gabby were outside. I felt so unwanted and worthless. Gabby brought up last night and she just pulled me down. I had a knot in me..so i went to see if bill was home. Then i turned around and decided not to go. I stayed behind in the pool area just tryin to relieve my stress. I sat down and just about fell asleep. Gab said she'd be back but i knew she wouldn't be so i just sat there for about an hour. It was nice and cool out so i had no problem with it. I'm glad i was alone. I needed to be. I felt so terrible about yesterday and how gabby wont believe me. I dont' even care anymore...I know that i didn't talk alla that stuff about her. I know her brothers made everything up. Then gabs said i was fake crying...ok..i don't fake cry...and i rarely do cry..only when things get BAD. I thought of what i could do...thought about how i wanted to be back *home* so badly. I don't know why ppl would make up lies about me or thalia..they're not true..not one word of it. I want todo something about this but i can't. I feel so unhealthy and worthless right now. I feel so ugly and repulsive to myself. All I want todo is just go to sleep cuz FCAT is tomarrow and plus im tired. Yep staying inside just wore me out. Well mom just got back so i'll post tomarrow.
