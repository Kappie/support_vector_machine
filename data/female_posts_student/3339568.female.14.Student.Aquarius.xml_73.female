Haha. As if I can see why people are serial offenders. Then I had a painfully boring Christian Studies lesson Jess dared 2 ask why the Old Testament was relevant when Mrs. Smart said the important part of the bible is Jesus' death and ressurection and all we've done is Old Testament boring stuff. Gosh Mrs. Smart's a bore. She puts me 2 sleep. Huge is stupid;with her annoying maps of Australia and feeble attempts to act out the word volcanoe and communicate with the Bunka Japanese girls.  AndLoz and Julia defended her. Sad, sad people I have mi job interview tomoz. :D
