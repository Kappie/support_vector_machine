The car wash place just 2 mins away from laundry shop. I spend around 30 mins wash my car after that I went back to pick up my laundry. Around 4:30, I walked out from laundry shop and tried to open my car.   THEN!!! A white American guy walked to me and asked me if I saw a wallet at car wash place. I told him I didn't. He kept ask me and looked into my car like searching for something at the same time. I wanted make sure if he said is the car wash place, so I asked him where he was asking. I made sure that he was talking about the car wash place that I went to around a hour ago, and I told him that I am sure I didn't see any wallet. Then, he asked me if I was leaving or not, I told him I was. He started to using his cell phone save my plate number. I was confused by his action, and I ask him:" You think I stole your wallet?!!" He kept save my plate number and said:" Yes, I think you stole my girlfriend's wallet." I was SO surprised, and I said:" What? That's so stupid!!!" He walked away from me and my car. I looked at him and he got in a white car which I noticed was parking beside my car over car wash place. So, I went to there, and saw that girl who was washing that white car inside of that car. I walked to the driver side door and asked her:" You think I stole your wallet? " She said:" No." I said:" That's so stupid!!! Do you want search my car??!!! I haven't go home yet.!!" She said:" No, I don't wanna search your car." I was so mad at that I told her that I don't even know what her wallet looks like, and I went to close to her car once because I needed the cleanser for my car window, and I had to cross her car to get it. She was saying that she didn't think I stole her wallet. I just left them madly. That made me So MAD!!!!!! After while, I thought that I should stay there longer and ask them if they need call the police or not 'cause I would like to call police for them!!!! Stupid Couple!!!!!  昨天下午发生了一件让我及其气愤的事！！！！！！昨天下午2点过的样子，我去一家叫soap box的洗衣店洗衣服，那是家我常去的店，基本上是一个月两次的样子。和往常一样，我先洗衣服，然后在等烘干机烘干衣服的时候就去洗车。洗车的地方离洗衣店非常的近，开车大概一`两分钟就到了。我大概花了半个多小时洗车，然后回到洗衣店取出已经烘干的衣服，折折好，放入洗衣筐中，一切准备就绪后，就打算走人。  当我正打开车门，把洗衣筐放入后座的时候，一个三十多岁的白人男子走过来问我有没有在洗车的地方看见一个钱包，我回忆了一下，没有看见什么钱包，就告诉他没有看见。但是他却继续地问我真的有没有看见，我觉得他可能掉了钱包，所以在问那里洗过车的人，而且他会来问我我觉得也没有什么好奇怪的，因为我的车子太容易辨别，也太容易给人留下很深的印象。我为了确定自己有没有听错地方，就问他他说的是什么地方，得到肯定是那个我刚才去过的洗车地方后，我很确信的告诉他我没有看见任何钱包。这时，他就边问我是不是要走了，边像是在找什么一样向我车里不停的看。我告诉他我的确是要走了，他就走到我车后面，用手机纪录我的车牌号码。我当时就觉得很奇怪，于是就问他：“你不会觉得我偷了你的钱包吧？？”他边抄我的车牌号码，边说：“是的，我觉得你偷了我女朋友的钱包。”说完就转身离开。我当时是惊讶的不知道说什么，于是我跟着他向一辆白色的车子走去。我记得那辆车，因为在洗车的地方那辆车停在我旁边，而且我记得的另两个原因是那是辆老式的宝马，宝马的徽记已经磨白了，加上那个女人在洗车时很仔细，所以记得很牢。我走到驾驶座那边的门，那个男人坐在驾驶座，女人坐在另一边。我就对那个女人说：“这是在是太荒谬了！！你觉得我偷了你的钱包吗？”那个女的一脸流氓的样子说：“没有。”于是我说：“我连你钱包什么样子都不知道，你要不要去我车里找？我还没回过家！”那个女的说：“不，我不想去你车里找。我不觉得你偷了我的钱包。”到这个时候我还有什么好说的，于是我就很气愤地走了。走了大概十五分钟左右，我就在想我当时应该就不走，问他们需不需要叫警察来，我倒是挺愿意帮他们叫警察的！！！！  气死我了！！！死老外！！！！
