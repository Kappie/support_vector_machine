I probably would've thrown my computer out of a window. But that's me. I need internet journal crap. I think it's a sick sick obsession. Ugh.  Saw Harry Potter 3 today. It's a pretty good movie, actually, even though they left a SHITLOAD out from the book. I was quite angry (since I am a massive potter-nerd). Either way, the two boys are becoming so handsome! It makes me giggle. I may be 17 and they are 14, but i can still think they are cute. I went with my youth group to the movie and it was really fun....except that my best friend is dating the guy I like. We talked about it, and she feels bad, but I just can't stand it. Anyway, I went over to kp's house afterwards and halfway through the late night friends episode realized I was a complete fifth wheel. scott had kp (not officially, but it is obvious they like each other), and zach had elise. Who did I have? The fucking couch I guess. Or maybe my wild cherry pepsi. He was a fun date. So I just got up and left. I was pretty upset. Being single is so hard right now. I'm at the point where I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to about how I am feeling. I guess everyone is tired of knowing how I feel. They just don't care.  Plus, my guy friends are assholes. if a certain boy whose name starts with E fucking whines about me calling him an asshole anymore, he will get punched. Has he ever considered the fact that I said that b/c he IS an asshole? I was tired of him ignoring what I had to say and always turning the conversation back to him. I would ask him a question, he'd answer, I'd respond, then I would tell a little bit on my own answer, he would NOT respond, then he would go back to the part about him. Maybe he doesn't realize it...I dunno. Either way, I was fed up with being overshadowed by his trivial problems. I didn't want to vent necessarily - I just wanted to be acknowledged.  I hate my life today.  But at least I have my new journal. Sigh.
