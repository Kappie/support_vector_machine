OoOpss... by the way how do I add back the links to the different blog pages? I think I have lost them all... =X  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A poem here to share...    Emily Brontë    Love and Friendship   Love is like the wild rose-briar, Friendship like the holly-tree— The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms But which will bloom most constantly?   The wild-rose briar is sweet in the spring, Its summer blossoms scent the air; Yet wait till winter comes again And who will call the wild-briar fair?   Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now And deck thee with the holly's sheen, That, when December blights thy brow, He may still leave thy garland green.  urlLink    urlLink
