My mom especially. She is a horrible driver (cause she has multiple sclerosis?) and she WILL NOT ADMIT IT. every time  i drive with her, i honestly fear for my life. She almost crashes into cars, and swerves in and out of traffic and makes me want to die. AND SHE IS SO FUCKING NAIVE. She knows nothing of boulder, its "that damn town with alternative people and dirty hippies and punks and gross subculture". and its retarded. And she has the right to yell at me whenever she feels the need to do so, yet when i "raise my voice" i am grounded and such. Being around them makes me hate everything in this world, cause they suck. and having my aunt around is horrible. i mean, i love her and all.... shes my aunt. but having her around is like having another one of my moms around. ITS TWICE THE FUN,  LEMME TELL YOU.  My vacation is more stressful than school. I want dylan.   on a ligher and more exciting note, i hung out with shana today! I love her! she is so cool. we walked around pearl street... and went to galleries and were all thoughtful and then we went to a bunch of stores and tried on UGLY clothing and for some reason, all these stupid activities were SO MUCH FUN. shes so optimistic, and makes me feel like this cool, invincible person and makes me want to get up and not drift through life like a lump of crap. and she makes me laugh, shes so funny. im going to work with her this summer at the womens wilderness institute... which is exciting.   i also went to the spa today with my mom and aunt. I got this scrub thing and now im SO moisturized. my skin is sooo soft. the lady put me in this big bathtub thing and sea-salt scrubbed me, and then hosed me down and then put lotion on me. i felt like a really big baby, just having someone bathe me.  John shirley is really emo. He sits in his room and whines about how he wants a girlfriend and is WHINEY AS FUCK and always sad and...uh...sucks.  i really need to get out of my house, too bad i cant drive...  dylan just called me, im all distracted now... !abbyÂ¡  oh yeah! someone, email me with something exciting to say...slinkypandemonium@yahoo.com
