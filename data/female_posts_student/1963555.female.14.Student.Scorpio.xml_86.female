Why the hell didn't I hear about this? what ever..... I guess I'll buy it mabey, I'm a little shocked that Pat didn't post anything on this but oh well. So yesturday I went and picked up Courtney Love- America's Sweetheart not too bad... also Orange County S/T. Goood...... ugh I'm all crappy. oh I puked after that last post..... nasty. I felt so sick. This "vacation" is blowing so bad!! I hate it! It's going by too fast and I'm gonna have to go back to school I don't want to, and I have to read 16 chapters in our stupid books for World Civ. ick... bye
