I'm just kind of tired right now and numb and smiling. I wish I could play more piano, I hope it's enough (is it ever? no) so I'll probably play more later on, but c'est la vie. It's always like this though. It always goes better when I'm warmed up, which doesn't leave much to work with when I'm not and just about ready to play, really.  Looking at the lyrics: I've never missed anyone to death. Or I deny it fiercely. I don't know, I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for doing anything that stupid. What was your profile, K? "fucking retarded?"  Comfortable, almost satisfied.
