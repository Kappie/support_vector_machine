I hold a lot of personality traits that make it easy for me to be "one of the guys" in a metaphorical sense of course. I love guys with too much of myself to ever be not womanish in the attraction sense. I am pretty sure I still hold the title of "Straightest Girl in America." If this has changed, someone please let me know.  But here is the rub...I have a hard time getting along with other girls. There are, of course, the ones I love and I could not live without. Along with those select few are also the ones I have to work and spend time with under no choice of my own, all I chose was a little duress actually; retired high school cheerleaders, drama queens, melodramatic waifs, etc. But with these emotions and thoughts I feel I am getting closer and closer to...well...what I hate; an over-emotional, over-analytical, over-presumptuous woman.  With the leaving of the training job, stage managing children�s theatre, and being cast in an adult drama production that will immediately follow�I have a bit to think about. Add to that mix being single and not liking it, having no automobile, spending a little too much time with my mother who has been gracious enough to take me where I need to go, and the fact that I am 22 and have no concrete idea of what I am doing with my life.  My family is great. My friends are wonderful even though they seem to be few and I never see them. I do have lots of blessings I am thankful for, but it is one of those times when the clouds seem to reign and overcome all sunshine. I think I should simply get another tattoo. That always makes me feel better. Something to save for I guess.
