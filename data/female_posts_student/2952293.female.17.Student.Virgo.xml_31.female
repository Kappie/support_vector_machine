The one librarian (copy nazi) renewed it until April 30, so I can stop coming back every two weeks. I walked into English... AND TRIPPED IN FRONT OF DR. DODEN! I got really feisty about feminist issues. Dr. Doden was like, "Rush Limbaugh calls feminists 'feminazis' but do you see feminists rounding up 6 million men and burning them?!" It was great! We had shorter classes again, thankfully! I didn't understand my lab AT ALL! Before chapel we played some "Crocadilla" that old school game. I was the "Grand Croc Master". Then we had to do flags... usually Lauren Smiley messes up, but alas it was my turn. Right before I was gonna go, Dr. Doden was like "Don't trip!" (since I already had today). I didn't trip, but the actual flag slipped out of my hand and was dragging on the ground. I laughed. Later he came up to me and said, "Well, you didn't trip, but you giggled!" It was true.  I have a Spanish test tomorrow, and I really don't understand. Wish me luck!
