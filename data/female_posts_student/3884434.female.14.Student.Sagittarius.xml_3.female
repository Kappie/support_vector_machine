(TJ and I like each other, but we're bothnot allowed to date yet) He hasn't replied to any of my emails,and every time I'm on the internet he signs off. I have no idea what's going on, and I would like to find out. If he doesn't like me anymore, he could at least tell me to my face instead of being a coward. And he should know I wouldn't care if he doesn't like me anymore. I mean, we could still be friends. Why do guys have to be so much trouble?  Anyways, I went running errands with my parents today. Kyle (my 7-year-old brother) was such a brat. Every store we went into, he threw a fit because he wanted a toy. He is soooo annoying, but he can still be cute sometimes. (sometimes meaning when he's sleeping) Oh well. I still love him.  My mom and I got ribbon to use as belts at the store. It's a great idea (and the style is coming back from the 80's), but I think we got the ribbon too short (1 1/2 yards). Oh well. They were only 74 cents each. We can always get more for real cheap.  I made dolls earlier of me and my friends at prom (in the future). I'm going to try and send it to you guys................   Okay, well it's not working, so if you'd like to see it, email me at:  urlLink melmel12889@aol.com   But, I may change myemail address later, so I'll update you if it does.  Hugs and kisses!
