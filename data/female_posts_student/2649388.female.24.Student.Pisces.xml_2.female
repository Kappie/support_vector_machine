Not like happy shopping, shopping for clothing or accessories.  We went shopping for food and home supplies.    Our first stop is Costco -- I bought food, contact solution, ... and I almost got a 48-pack peanuts M's (I love peanuts M's ... those are yummy, but I decided to watch my weight).  After shopping in Costco, my friend Jamie and his roommate decided to eat hot dogs from Costco.  So they were there eating, and I was extrememly tempted ... but I told myself: "Must resist ..." the reason being, those hot dogs are made with beef, and I was still a bit freaked out by the Mad Cow disease ... (ok, so I was being over-paranoid).  The resistence didn't last long, I shortly gave in to the "peer pressure" and ate the beefy hot dog -- this is the first time I ever had beef since the mad cow disease incidence.  (Yeah, if there are holes starting to appear in my brain after 20 years, I am gonna come back and sue those 3 =P) Anyhow ... the hot dog was actually pretty good ... I enjoyed it quite a lot.  Then we move onto Target ... I bought a blanket (My room is freezing due to the drafty windows) and some of those "peel and stick" hooks that stick to the wall so I can hang stuff up in the kitchen.  My roommate and I wanted to reorganize our kitchen because w/ those new cooking tools that we brought back from CA, our kitchen is running out of cabinet space.    Finally, my roommate went to PetSmart -- she has been wanting a beta fish for a long time.  I never liked fish -- they freak me out.  My phobia towards fish goes a long way back since Junior high ... it's a long story; anyway, the point is, I am not too fond of fish personally.  But the one that my roommate got is actually *cute*.  It's ruby-red, and lazy as hell.  My roommate settled him in a little fish tank, and he just sits there ... after 10 mins, I swear he is still at the very same position ... not even wabo-ing that much. =/ My roommate says it's relaxing watching her fish being in the tank ... I guess she is right.  After all, that fish is so lazy.    So PetSmart was our last stop, and I am pretty happy about the shopping today -- our kitchen is re-organized so that there is more counter space, and now I am all bundled up in my blanket, warm, fuzzy, drinking hot tea and blogging.  *smile happily* =)
