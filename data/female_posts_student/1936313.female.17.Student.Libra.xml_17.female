I told Her it was just stress aaaaand we continued on and She asked about college sooo I confessed about all the stress THAT was causing in itself........  She is a fantastic teacher.. Absolutely the best of the best.. haha......... Her husband has contacts with Grant MacEwan and She's getting Him to check on where the heck my portfolio is so I know what the heck I should be doing. (Though it does sound a lil sleazy doesn't it? -lol- I'm pulling on contacts to get me into college... like those stupid teen flicks with the rich kids having their fathers get them in to Harvard or something..... Its just a silly community college..) I've been very fortunate in school to have such great teachers....  I'm still scared that I failed the portfolio and can't get in now... Registration for GMC is on May 13th..... (lucky day, eh?)... soo I still have a headache worrying over that... and I'm hungry... I can't remember when I ate last...  I don't think I'm going to go back to school for English today. We'll see how I feel in an hour..... (ooh how many times have I said that..... Alright.. I won't kid myself.. I'm not going to English today....)  OH!!! Guess what else... MY TRIG EXAM WAS PUSHED BACK   AGAIN!!   I am seriously never going to write that exam! (Again.. why am I complaining?) Math teacher was away yesterday when we had our Conics exam.. and was away again today.... so nope.. no test... Monday I guess... (Dads getting kinda sick of me telling him in the morning that I'll need to be picked up at 4:30 afterschool and then getting a call halfway through the day saying I won't anymore.)
