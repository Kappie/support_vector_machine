I got up like 2 hours ago...and then i just layed in bed for a while...just thinking...then i got dressed and went to visit my dad at the cemetrey..i dunno...just esspically today i'm not sure why but i really miss him...makes me wonder how different life would beif he were still here...if i'd be happier...i dunno...honestly i would trade everything i have or would ever in the future have just to see my dad one last time...i would trade all the people in the world, all the things that i have...everything...just soi could see him one last time...so i can properly say my good-bye to him...i miss him so much...i hate being home alone, i know i have my dog and everything...but i just wish my dad were here...like when i was little and i came home and he would be here...i just wish i could give him one last hug and a kiss...why must people take away the people i love the most? I wish i had a normal family...with a mother AND a father...i envy those who have a full family...and also those who have more than one father (like a step-dad). I don't think anyone is ever going to realize the pain of loosing a parent unless they have themselves...loosing a close uncle or grandparent is so different...no matter how close you may be to them, you are never as close to them as your parents...whatever...i just want a hug...i just wanna see one of my friends or something so i can get a giant hug...or just to talk to them...whatever...i dunno...i just don't like being alone at home...i know i should go and work out but i'm just not in the mood for it right now...i just want a friend or someone....
