(but good try guys... it was amusing.)  aha then the highlight of the night came... evan picked up a framed picture of vanessa's sister from the mantlepiece, and then he was putting it back, but it slipped from his hands and fell  face first  onto the floor... and the glass kindof broke. so he tried to get a vacuum to clean it up, but i wouldn't let him back in the room unless he told vanessa's dad... but he didn't, and just beat me down to get into the room.  so then we went upstairs cuz the guys wanted to see vanessa's pimp phone that has buttons the size of her hands, and her dad was upstairs... so we were like yelling at evan to tell her dad what he did.  "evan! go tell vanessa's dad what you  broke !"-nikole "no...why are you doing this?"-evan "just go tell her dad what you broke, evan in the  orange shirt ."-nikole "...mike, wanna switch shirts?"-evan  ahahaha wow. this went on for like 10 minutes... then eventually evan turned it on me? and was doing the same thing nikole was doing, but to me... yeah i dunno why. and then he kept saying he was never gonna hang out with us/me ever again...thanks...minus the fact that i didn't say anything.  aaand enough of that story.  ok so remember in my last blog, when i said my mum kindof said maybe to me getting my eyebrow pierced? look at this:  "i told your dad about the eyebrow piercing thing"-mum "oh really? what did he say?"-me "he was shocked..."-mum "oh... so does that mean i can't have it done?"-me "no, i don't think he minds."-mum "really?! so i can?!"-me "...well, it would hurt..."-mum "i know..."-me "well, i don't see why not."-mum "oh my god, are you serious?! i love you! you're so awesome!"-mum "well, you only live once. and you might as well just get it done when you're at this age."-mum  wow. i love my parents SOOOOO much...but i kindof might think about it for longer...cuz i dunno if i want to have it done...cuz of the pain. but hey, i will be hot times 2... haha yeah no, i'm kidding about the hot-ness.  "so ray, my mum said i can get my eyebrow pierced!"-me "oh my god. don't!"-evan "...uh... why not?"-me "because...just... no. don't."evan "what the hell? why not?"-me "cuz... i dunno. it's not right for girls to get facial piercings... i'd say this to any girl."-evan "yeah, it's true."-mike "uh mike, you said you think an eyebrow ring would suit me... and you're getting your lip pierced, so what the hell?"-me (kindof getting mad at this point... cuz they were being serious.) "no, i said an eyebrow ring would suit you more than a lip ring."-mike "ugh! guys... stop...you suck."-me  ugh they were kindof being a-holes last night...and if you guys are taking the time to read this (which i kindof doubt you are), then apologize. NOW.  so yeah...other quotes:  *singing/rapping to superman by eminem on the karaoke machine* "yeah, you want me to tell you something?"-evan (not knowing what's going on) *moans* "yeah"-girl in karaoke machine. "what the f-ck?!"-evan  *later on in the song* "girl, you make me earl. what the f-ck? 'you make me earl?' ahahahahaha!"-evan, and then he laughed for like 5 minutes.  "wow guys. this area is so ghetto."-evan, every 5 minutes.  frik, all these quotes are things that evan said...  anyway. aaah i forgot to say the biggest thing that happened on friday night in my previous blog!   MY BROTHER WENT TO FORMAL/PROM!   aaah exciting stuff! wow. his date looked SO pretty! and he bought her a rose! aaah. he rocks.  k so that's that.  and i'm done for now... i have to f-cking study for exams today.  i stay wrecked and jealous for this,  for this simple reason.  kayte.
