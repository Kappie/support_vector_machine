Yeah, Colombia lost against Argentina, so now the finals is Argentina VS Brazil. It's always the same fuggin' story. I bet that Brazil is gonna win. Fug them, I say. I'm sick and tired of Brazil always winning. But man Uruguay was playing so good on the first half. They were controlling the ball so amazingly. At minute 22 they scored, but 10 minutes before that they had another chance of scoring. I mean, Uruguay was less than a meter away from the goal and then they miss it. Sigh, what a shame. But you should have seen Brazil when Uruguay scored... they were so fuggin' mad! They were pushing, kicking, smacking... they were trying to do anything they could so that they could get the ball. It was hilarious.  On the second half, though, Brazil scored in less than a minute. Bad stuff. Then Brazil started to control the ball now. So in other words,  Brazil still sucks.  They didn't win, they just won by luck. I hate penalty shots. It's not fair to win like that. It all depends on the goalie to stop the ball.Brazil is not the winner, they're just winners by luck. I hate them now. So now Colombia is going against Uruguay, and the finals is Argentina VS Brazil. I don't know who I want to win between those. I mean,I hate Argentina, but now I loathe Brazil, too. But I guess I'll have to go with Argentina, since they didn't beat Mexico. So... yeah. Go Argentina, I guess.   urlLink  But Uruguay kicks anyone's ar s e!
