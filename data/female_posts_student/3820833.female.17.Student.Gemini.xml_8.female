Read the lyric of the song heartily, it is meaningful.    We were supplied with this lyric during the practice today. My tears were almost dropped from my eyes for a few moments. I was touched with the meaning. Some of the Form 5 girls have the same sentiment when we were reminded that we are going to leave the school soon too. In the past few years, I spend most of the time in school. I have stayed in this school for 11 years. A lot of pictures were flashing across my mind in the very moment. Such as the farewell for Mrs Lai, the graduation night for the Form 5 students, farewell gathering for the band seniors, etc…Soon, I’ll leave my friends, my teacher, my juniors and my school; I am sure I would miss them a lot.    My tears are not worthy. No doubt, I will be the first person who shed tears whenever there is a sad ceremony, especiallyit is a farewell. That is the reason that I don’t feel like attending the farewell for Mrs Lai. I don’t want other people see me crying. Still, I’ve no choice about it,itis compulsory forall of usto attend the ceremony.    Tomorrow will be the last day for band practices. We are no longer required to attend the practices after the competition. =( Missing the moment when we are linking together practicing the formation, posture, musical…      Competition countdown : 2 days
