Ok yesterday miree and i decided we wanted to have some aloutte cheese so we went to kroger! as we were walking into kroger my mom calls miree's cell phone and told her she just dropped of some aloutte and crackers at the pool! but we still wanted to get some from kroger. so we assume that it would be over with the cream cheese and grated cheese. so after westoped by the free samples of cookies and got some crackers we went to the place where we thought there was cheese. well as we stand there looking at thecheese for about 5 minutes we decided it just wasnt there. so as miree is raising her hand looking around like an idiot i look for someone who works at krogers.I see this man stocking theshelvesand we go overthere. and miree asks where the alloutte is, the man first stands there like he is thinking then he asks if we looked in the cheesedeli miree and i looked at eachotherbecause we didnt knowthere was a cheese deli. as we follow the guy around to the other side of the storewe stop at like an oval stand thing that held a bunch of different cheese spreads and we just look at the one side for a while then we walk around and find our alloutte!!!! we were so excited!i guess you might of had to be there to understand our excitment!
