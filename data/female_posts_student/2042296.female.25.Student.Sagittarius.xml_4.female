I finally got a coffee machine and a mixer;) Then I got my own blanket and that's a relief, since he always steels the whole blanket in the night and I end up freezing naked beside him... Of course we couldn't leave Media Markt without a heap of dvds! I wanted the Dream Theater live-dvd "Scenes from New York" (awsome... I was completely taken away from this world when watching the concert. Those men are geniuses!), he got Matrix: Reloaded, Animatrix and some other movies, too. I love going shopping dvds with him, since we share the same interests.  I'm also getting used to the idea of living here permanently... It's still incredible, but I'm so happy!  Oops, Monty Python has already begun! Gotta go and laugh my ass off ;)
