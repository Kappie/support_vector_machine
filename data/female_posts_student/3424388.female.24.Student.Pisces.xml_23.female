Can't find anything about this on the Segway corporate site; wonder how Dean feels about this. The "America at 10 mph" team writes that Segway supports them emotionally and has donated some Segway batteries.  Still, traveling from Seattle to Boston, their route is 4300 miles, from August 5 - Oct 18... on a Segway. They'll be known to antiquity as "those crazy Segway guys." Perhaps Po Bronson will write something up about them.
