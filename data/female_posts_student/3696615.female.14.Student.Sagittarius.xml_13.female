Me - "is my ass cheek hanging out?"  Her - "i don't know but its in a cheap place"  anyway  yeah, i know, my photo isnt working. i cant fix that until i get home. so...  we're leaving on wedensday. wheeeeeee. busch gardens. i like that place. the lines are huge but i still like it. and the animals are rescue animals i believe. but at the same time it seems wrong to put them in a confined environment. but, at the same time theyre rescued and will be released back into the wild......  hmmmmm  ok
