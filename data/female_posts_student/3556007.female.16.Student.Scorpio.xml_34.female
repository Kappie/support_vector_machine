And on Sunday the Restoration Project played for 6pm service and then a concert afterwards.  It wasn't that great of music because it was slow, so I got Cassie and Ellen to pick me up.  We went and watched Peter Pan instead which Cassie had somehow never seen.  Monday was a bum day, I guess.  I don't remember and there is nothing written on my calendar.  Tuesday morning I went to IHOP with Cassie and Lindsay which was loads of fun!  Target shopping afterwards!  At noon my mom and I left to go to Guadalajara Mex restaraunt to meet up with the Bayou Park Stables lunch group.  It was so nice to see everyone again.  Olive is still trying to sell Merlin; Joan Cantrell has cancer and is undergoing chemo but seems strong still; Sherry Wallace still has Smokey, Brown, and Spirit; Laurie Levins stopped riding with ...  gosh what is his name -- really nice black guy who is tall and skinny but doesn't take very good care of his horses ... anyways she is now riding with teh people who have Tony Rome (I think); Kate is trying to go to college again and still has her quarter horse and arabian; and Tina is still operating over at Freeman Ranch, though, with the rainy weather for the past few months she hasn't been able to do much.  Debbie couldn't make it because her car got messed up in the rainy weather that we had on the drive over, but she is still avoiding the horse world I believe after the death of Mona  (Radiant Lady Oman).  It was nice to be able to see everyone again.  Band pratice in the evening was stressful with Jennifer because she is such a diva-bitch.  All I could keep thinking to myself was "Thank God she won't be there on Sunday night."  On Wednesday I met up with Alison and we rented ROTK and got garlic bread (which was the last time ever because I found out last night that Village Seafood and Pizza closed...  not making enough money, I guess). 'Twas quite fun!  Brian got his wisdom teeth pulled on Wednesday but still insisted that we go to Cafe Adobe on Thursday where he couldn't eat anything and then I lost my contact lense in the backseat of the car.  We saw Ivon (sp?) who looks like Draco Malfoy and is freaking hott while driving down Westheimer -- random!  Warped Tour got rained out on Friday, so we made t-shirts for Sylvio.  On Sunday I slept in way late because I had been up until 4 am the last two nights working on my website.  Then on Sunday night we went and we sang at church.  Afterwards we went and got totally wasted.  Me, Cassie, Andrew, Andrew, Brian, Emily, and Ellen.  We got home at 12:45am, and her mom was soo pissed off.  Ellen puked everywhere so the house is a mess, but we cleaned it all up while her mom was at work.  I don't think that I want to do that again for a while.  Yeah, I think that my mom knows that we were drinking becasue according to Ellen her mom said that my mom brought it up.  Oh well time to lay low for a while.  Warped Tour was just okay.  I only like Yellowcard and Story of the Year.  All the rest I didn't know or didn't really care to see.  Damn it...  I'm so obsessed with Brian its sickening.
