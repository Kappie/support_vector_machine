Yesterday, I finished 2 paintings then at night I went to Hooters to eat for Mikala's birthday/girl's night thing. Then we went to the mall and met up with 2 of her friends, Isaac and Garell (sp?). Then I came home. Wednesday was the Saves The Day concert with Tom and Ryan. I heard the one Hot Rod Circuit song I've been dying to hear so that was good. Saves The Day was good too, we didn't stay for the whole time but we stayed long enough to hear "Sell my old clothes, I'm off to heaven" and "Certain tragedy" which was amazing. That's about it, I guess. I'm not that confused anymore well I am but I'm taking it one day at a time cuz who knows what's up with this time. I've been wanting to say hi to someone on-line but I don't know when she's on cuz my buddy list is gayness and won't let me add anymore sns and I wrote him an e-mail which he didn't respond to and I think he has someone new. Which hurts, a lot but I prolly deserve it thoso I gotta take life one day at a time no matter how much it hurts. People have it a lot worse than I do somewhere out there. Ana and I had a hilarious conversation yesterday but with srious points. We found out we both feel weird going out like when we go out, even for 2 seconds or 2 hours we think of the stuff we miss and that makes it seem like going out is just being content, not fully happy. Something's missing..but anyways,Kev and I finally had a good talk last night, it made me really really happy :-D cuz we haven't had one like all week (lol). Well, I'm catching up with Liz right now then I gotta get ready so I'll write more tonight hopefully...-Camille-
