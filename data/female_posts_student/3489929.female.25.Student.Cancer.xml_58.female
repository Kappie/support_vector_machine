That's the subject of this week's Music Mambo. So to get started let's do something a little wacky.       Using the letters E-M-O-T-I-O-N, tell us how music affects you on an emotional level. You can use song lyrics, poetry...anything you want. Oh and since there are so many vowels, the letters don't always have to be the first letter of the word. Just bold that letter...and have fun!      "Wh  e  n it rains, it pours and opens doors that flood the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry..." (Train, "When I Look to the Sky")      "  M  ake it mine, takin' time, forgotten, speak for me, silent plea, surrender... what did you say, it's okay... did you miss me?" (Shelby Lynne, "Dreamsome")      "  O  h, yeah, life goes on... long after the thrill of living is gone..." (John Mellencamp, "Jack  Diane")      "S  t  ep out the front door like a ghost into the fog where no one notices the contrast of white on white, and in between the moon and you, angels get a better view of the crumbling difference between wrong and right..." (Counting Crows, "Round Here")      "  I   go back to watchin' summer fade to fall, growing up too fast and I do recall wishing time would stop right in its tracks..." (Kenny Chesney, "I Go Back")      "Y  o  u were everything, everything, that I wanted... we were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it, all of the memories so close to me just fade away... all this time you were pretending, so much for my happy ending..." (Avril Lavigne, "My Happy Ending")      "  N  ow that I've met you, would you object to never seeing each other again?" (Aimee Mann, "Deathly")      Now are you ready to mambo? The bear is..that's for sure. This week, since we're on a mood/emotion theme, I'm going to list some moods and you tell us the song that makes you feel that way or makes you think of that emotion. Are you ready to mambo? Good, then let's get dancing!      Happy: "Who Wouldn't Want to Be Me?" by Keith Urban   Sad: "Hands to Heaven," by Breathe   Angry: "You Oughta Know," by Alanis Morissette   Amorous: "You Really Got a Hold on Me," Smokey Robinson   Dreamy: "Crazy for You," Madonna   Freaked: "Wise Up," Aimee Mann   Independent: "One-Way Ticket (Because I Can)," by LeAnn Rimes   Misunderstood: "I'll Break Before I Bend," Allison Moorer      Everybody mambo!
