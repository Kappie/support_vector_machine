Now I have a two-week break and after that I'll drive again, so hopefully I don't forget everything during those two weeks.  I also got those juhannus pictures today and they were ok, although there was one horrible pic of me... Oh well, I don't have to show it to anybody if I don't want to. :P  And btw, I had a really funny dream last night. It was pretty chaotic, but I remember me going to an empty candy shop and sitting in a chair watching Spongebob Squarepants. Suddenly I was at school and everybody had to get out of there fast because there was an angry Spongebob tearing the place up... Go Spongebob, go! :D
