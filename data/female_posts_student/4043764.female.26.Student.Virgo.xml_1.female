While this means we will not have a kitchen to cook in, I will have $700 to play around with that month. This is major, seeing as none of the consultancies have come through, and I've been living off of my last consultancy check for the past three months. F@*&ing NGOs.  Anyway, last night I experienced the real "bling bling in the ATL" in midtown and buckhead. Britfriend took me to her current apartment building ["it's a condo... condo, dah-ling"] where they were doing some inefficient cookout [electric grill? come on.] I am happy that she's selling that place and moving soon.  She is moving from midtown chic to buckhead fabulous - into a five-star full-service condominium with "views" of the city (read: overpriced apartment where you strain to see beyond the smog)- once she sells the condo in midtown.   The buckhead place had a little opening event with open bar, hors d'oevres. Total upscale bullshit. As usual, got hit on by 1,001 gay men who think I am "gorgeous". I think if I hear another man say, "Girl, you are so byoootiful... If only I were straight..." I will -  Hell, I don't know what I will do. A compliment is a compliment. I'll take it wherever I can get it.  So I meet this guy -let's call him Steve - who works at a very famous upscale hotel. He walks into one of the floor models, takes a look at baseboards, doors, etc. He comes over to me, hand at one side of his mouth and whispers,   "Girl, it's like Target in that bathroom."  "You mean, like lots of aromatherapy candles and cheap towels?"  "No, like look at the baseboards. They look like painted plywood. The doors are flimsy plastic. This could never fly at the [very famous upscale hotel (VFUH)]."  "Oh, I see what you mean. The details."  "Yes, honey. It's ALL about the details." A flick of the wrist emphasizes his point.  As Steve hisses his disdain about the quality of the craftsmanship of the apartm - I mean, condo - a woman with a nametag, decent suit and frizzy, sun-weathered hair comes over. She knows this guy because she, too, worked at VFUH once upon a time.  "Hey, what do you think?" "Oh, girl! It's faaaaaaabulous! Doesn't hold a candle to VFUH!" "Thanks. Hey, whatever happened to that gorgeous guy I went out on that date with..."  I am embarassed for her and walk away. I can tell that Steve does not want to answer that question. I later find out that this gorgeous guy who took her out on the date, takes lots of women out on dates. And he is out of her league. He was having an off day. I feel even sadder. At least she gets asked out on dates by people who are out of her league.  But I perk up. Because 1,001 gay men think I am gorgeous. I can't believe that I missed  urlLink Kerry's  speech to find this shit out.
