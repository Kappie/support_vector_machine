I mean, I know that I want to grow up more before I get back with Ken, but I've never really thought about  what  growing up actually is. Is it something that I'll just know? Will I just be sitting somewhere one day and out of the blue realize that I've 'grown up' to the point that I want? HOW WILL I KNOW!?!?!?!? In a deperate attempt to grasp a small part of all this, I made myself a general list of some of the things I want to accomplish before I'll consider myself 'grown up' in any sense. Thefirst thing is responsibility --- I want to prove to myself that I can be responsible. I want to get a job and a car, those are both necessities.I want to keep up with my homework, because I slacked off on that a lot last year, and I want tomake sure my grades stay up, becauseI KNOW  that I'm capable, I'm just lacking in motivation and self-determination. I consider myself a fairly reliable person, and I don't think I have much of a problem with reliability, but I want to work on keeping myself organized and rationing out my time so I don't push myself too much or let other people down. I don't know, maybe I'm setting my goals too high here, but I suppose things can be adjusted later... And then there's the whole category of my future. I want to decide for sure what college I want to go to. I want to apply for college, financial aid, scholarships... all that good stuff. Most of the colleges I'm looking at aren't all that cheap, and w/ mom and dad not paying for any of it, I'm going to have to rely a lot on scholarships and financial aid. I don't want to be paying off student loans until I'm 35 like my parents did... Plus I want to be financially independent. Once I graduate I'm going to have to pay for everything by myself... cell phone, gas, car insurance, etc. And of course there's food. I mean, I'm planning on living on Ramen for the most part, and that's less than .10 package, but still... I'm just kinda worried about all that stuff. Graduating in general is just going to be big for me... In all honesty I'm a little scared about what my life is going to be like a year from now. It's going to be weird... but yeah, on top of those two things ^ there's some other personal stuff that I want to work on. Like communication, because I suck at that, especially in relationships. I have a hard time talking about my feelings and expressing when something bothers me, and that's caused quite a few problems for me in the past few years. I also want to work on my self-esteem, b/c having a low opinion of myself is going to negatively affect me in a lot of aspects of my life. *sigh*   I don't really know, but this whole topic is putting me in a bad mood right now, and I just want to be happy, so I'm going to end this.
