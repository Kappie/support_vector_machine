But yesterday, xint made me two things for the formerly blank, white space at the top of the page out of two of those pictures. Well, actually he made three, but I really like two of them...  ...Look at it... Not empty anymore. :) Yay!  Here they are.   One    Two    Three   Whoop, whoop for xint! :)
