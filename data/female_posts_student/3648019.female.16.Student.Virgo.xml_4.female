You get that joke, don't you Eric? Oh, well... Tomorrow is my last exam...thank God. I thought they were never going to be over... the only one I was worried about was Chemistry...yeah, sure.  Tomorrow is also the release of Hellsing #3...I am so going to get that. But on Friday if I can hop on the subway to Chinatown I'll get it there. It's always cheaper there. Kewl stuff can be found if you know where to look.  Also, I've finally gotten off my lazy butt and decided to do those d*mn paper dolls I've been talking about...I'm almost done series one.  That'll be fun.  Ciao.
