It kicks ass! oh and this morning in science me madeline and christina's usual computer was hijacked by some random bitches so Mr. Samilenko sent us to Mr. Chick's room to use his computer. But we couldn't FIND it. so we had to go back and ask for directions. Turns out it was directly down the hallway. Mr. Samilenko like groped madeline in the process. It was a little anerving. yeah then today after school madeline got locked out of her house so she came over to our house until her mom got home. That was a fun time. Ok with the new Mac System we got this thing... iChat. Which is like AIM for mac users and it's compatable (sp?) with aim and aol, and it's like so amazing... but there is no away message! i'm like NO. so i'm going to have to download aim again anyway just to like get an away message. baha. oh vell.
