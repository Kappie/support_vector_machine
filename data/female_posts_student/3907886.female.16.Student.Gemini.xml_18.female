I donno why, but I suppose it always is...    Anyways, I'm staying at the the SeaPort Inn.  It's pretty nice here.  We have a suite, which means it has a seperate bedroom.  My parents get that one.  My brother gets the bed outside that, and I get the sofa bed in the living room part.  We also have a mini kitchenett which has basicly just a sink, coffee maker, microwave, and the ever so popular Minibar!  The bathroom is really nice this time too.  Their's a huge tub with jets and everything, so it's like a mini jacuzie!  Their's also a seperate glass shower, and a huge counter with a bowl sink that is awsome.  The water comes out of this pipe horizontal, so it kinda looks like a river, then drops off like a waterfall.  It's really neat.  I donno why, but whenever we go to hotels, we always end up spending alot on a room that's more then we need.  I wish that we could have just gotten 2 regular rooms, then I could actually have my own bed, and I wouldn't have to listen to my dad snore.  It's so fucking lould, not to mention anoying at 3 in the mornign.    Speaking of anoying, this whole family vacation thingy is really starting to piss me off.  It seems that everything my parents do is embaressing, or stupid or something.  I wish that they would just shut their fucking mouths sometimes.  I know that they think the exact same thing about me because they tell me all the time.  And they always complaine that they are tired.  And u know what being tired means: being craby and a pain in the ass.  I just wish that I was home.  This week is never going to end.  How boring is it to be stuck in some lame ass town in the middle of fucking nowhere with your family?  You know what else, someone reading this will be like: shut up, u go everywhere with your family, you're such a spoiled little brat!  But if putting up with my parents alone in the car for over 20 hours straight is something that makes me lucky, then whoever thinks that is the one who's fucked up, not me...  I just want to be home with my friends for the end of the summer.  I mess everyone so much, and I haven't even been gone all that long yet.  It's just that whenever I can find time to go on a computer, no one is ever on.  And it'll take me all day of doing shit for my brother just to be able to make a call on his cell,   I gotta go, but i'll write later  ~Ani
