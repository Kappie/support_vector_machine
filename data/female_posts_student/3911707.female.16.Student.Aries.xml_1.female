I had already asked Jessie to come swimming with me, and since they backed out, we decided we'd rather go swimming on Big Green. Are you crazy? Two girls are going to drive to somewhere they've never drove before? But how lost can I get going 25 miles? Oh, I'm sure we could get lost... easily. Thank God for the natural skills of, "um, excuse me sir, where in the world is Dodge Memorial Park? We're not from around here." And then I'll just bend over while pumping my gas. That'll get us a decent reply. My main goal is to make it there with no problem so we can say, "we don't need men, we're smart enough ourselves!" I just realized... I'm broke and we wont have much food. My dad's sick of me asking for cash, infact, he told me to get a job. Maybe I'll tell Jessie to pack a meal for us. Hopefully she's not like my family and actually has things in their cupboards. I should get to bed, considering we came up with the genius idea to leave at 9am. Just hold on a second, I'm not done. Dumbass never called me today, and I was really looking forward to talking to him. On the other hand, I did have Nick come over and he suffered and watched tv with me for an hour and a half with my dad and Jen. He must be insane. Nick's a good guy and all, but I'm just not seeing anything happening. I'm horrible at hinting that I'm not interested, I tend to be too sweet about it. Fuck me, I'm cursed to break hearts.
