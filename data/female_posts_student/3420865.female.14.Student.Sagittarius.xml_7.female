(am i starting to sound like evan yet? haha). and i'm done. i still [heart] you.  k so obviously my descreteness is bad. you remember my story about [bruce] and [ethel] at the dance? ray figured out who they are. and it didn't even take him a long time...frik.  wahoo. 5 days. i'm getting so psyched. and erin had better be too. p.s. erin, you didn't mention me in your blog yet. but you mentioned cody like 274927494 times. i hurt.  guys... i woke up at 12:01 today- that's frikin crazy talk. i surprised myself. haha like 2 minutes after i woke up, my dad said we were going out for lunch. so i got ready in like... 20 minutes. props.  ugh i hate llamas. really. they're so stupid and UGLY. but IF someone happened to buy me one, or i inherited one or something... i'd name it ethel. that kinda relates back to my [bruce] and [ethel] story. liz knows what i'm talking about.  k since i'm such a loser, i have no plans tonight... anyone? anyone at all? no? ok.  peace out homies.  but sometimes its just about feeling good- like John Kusac and pop punk. kayte.
