For some reason, ever since yesterday, I haven't been able to stop smiling. This is something I can't even begin to explain, because I don't understand what changed ... I don't think anything changed at all, in fact.      Maybe the loose wires in my brains finally fully disconnected and I'm totally crazy now. So who had their money on July 28th?      Will all my    Your Sweetest b.
