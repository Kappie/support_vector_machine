It was sooo cool. Our little condo, hotel thing was awesome too. They had aligators in the main pavillions little lake thingy.  Been working constantly... trying to get 40 hours a week. And yes I am still at Target. And I am getting to work backroom next week. Which is awesome cause I hate dealing with people.  Meet a guy, he is soo cool. Long story though andvery complicated. His name is Joey. I know he likes me, but he afraid of hurting this other chicks feelings so I don't know what is going on. We are supposed to be talking about it tomorrow... night.. maybe. I like him though.. so hopefully, for once, everything will go my way. My dad is back in town, which totally kicks ass. I can't wait to see him. The best thing is, is that I told him that I wanted a tattoo.. and he thinks that that is awesome. So.. maybe I can get him to co-sign on one for me. Hopefully.. :-).  I really miss talking to Aaron, I haven't talked to you in a while... I am sorry. But I do need to talk to you sometime soon. You have this way of making all my problems go away, which is good considering you are 4 hours away. Oh good news!! I am going to IU next year!!!
