Apparently, the fool thinks that I'm always going to be there for him, or something, like I'm always going to extend the olive branch to that abusive emotional cripple.   He says to me "The truck broke down in Baton Rouge and I need you to call your brother (who lives in Alabama) and see if he'll let me borrow his tow dolly for a few weeks."  He neglects to mention this is Farley's truck and Farley is still in California. (the Asshole just got back to Savannah from there recently and apparently there's still more of his company at Ft. Irwin) Why he's helping Farley and why Farley can't handle his own business is beyond me.  But the Asshole made it seem like it was HIS truck that was stuck in Baton Rouge and he was in dire straits, until a little creative questioning on my part caught him in his lie.  So I told him no. I wouldn't help him. I gave him Doug's number in Alabama and told him to call there and ask.   Thing is, The Asshole and I were in this POW/MIA group called Rolling Thunder, and that group gives out patches to its members to put on their motorcycle vests. Since I moved I'm no longer a member and it's been so long since I've paid dues, the Chapter is after me (And The Asshole) for the cost of the patches plus court costs (they've taken us to court, you see) or the return of the patches.  The Asshole was going to Virginia anyway, and he said he'd give them to the Chapter President for me, so I sent them to him, trusting him to do this one thing for me since I paid for the divorce and didn't ask for any alimony and relinquished my rights to his retirement and everything.  This was in MARCH.  The Asshole STILL hasn't sent the patches back and now the Chapter President is getting pretty testy with me, which I totally understand.  The Asshole said he packed them. HE PACKED THEM?? Why didn't he fucking send them to Art when he got them?? In MARCH?? The fuck does he mean he packed them? Is he moving somewhere? Good! I hope The Asshole moves himself right into the middle of a Third World Country ravaged by War and Ebola.  AFTER sending the patches back. And he has the audacity to call me and ask me for help?  I get angrier and angrier the more I think about it. How DARE he?   And I'm in a tough situation cause if I call him out and curse at him he'll never send the patches back (that's how he is, if you pressure him he balks.) but I can't STAND being nice to him.  I can't really take him to court because I'm in California, he's in Savannah, and the patches (or $100 plus court costs) have to get to Virginia somehow. Can I take him to court in California and get a judgement against him? I'm calling Legal Aid on Monday. Fuck this, I'm 9 months pregnant and don't need this hassle.  Speaking of pregnant, can you believe The Asshole was fishing for information? He obviously heard from the Rumor Mill that I was preggo, and was like "So, how's your health? Anything  important  coming up in the near future? Anything I should, you know,  know  about?" Like the baby could be his, or something! Ha! What a LAUGH!!! Like it's any of his business anyway. Asshole.  I Hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate him. I think I'm going to call him tomorrow and threaten his ass. No more nice ex wife.  -Me
