They're actually longer than I expected them to be. Anyway, here I go. End of School: So now we're officially "freshies", I guess. It's kind of scary, considering it seems like just yesterday we were just coming to Canyon, and I got maggots in my locker, and we had to Tolkien and all that. So anyway, our advancement was scheduled on the coldest day ever, and all the girls were sitting there freezing their shoulders off because almost all of them were wearing strappy dresses. The superintendent made a really dumb speech about an eagle and and egg or something or other. It was so dumb, I can't really remember it. Then the awards were given out, and stuff, and by the time the Lindsay Forte was done speaking, and my feet were thoroughly frozen, we had to go up to get our Certificate of Advancement(s). The whole affair was rather boring. The most interesting part, I think, was Ms. Shoptaw's singing the National anthem. Oh yeah, and there was the whole thing with Mr. Lefkowitz. He was cutting all the other speakers off when he was saying their names. It was kind of bad, but made the ceremony more bearable, in a way. Well that was the boring part. Before that, we had a concert, and about a million people got the Outstanding Orchestra award thing. Me included. And then there was Great America, which was lots of fun. Jessica, Jane, Flora, Christina and I were together, and we kept running into Yongsoo, for some reason. We persuaded Flora to go on all kinds of rides-- we were with her when she rode her first roller coaster! Yay Flora! Then, on the water ride, I met this guy named Jeff who was really hot. I mean, really hot. Even Flora, who likes her Asian guys, thought he was good-looking. He was. We went twice, and the first time, he was in front of us, and then the second time, I was right next to him. Unfortunately, I got this unsinkable urge to pee, and I was worried I was going to leak during the drop. Fortunately, Jessica helped me through it, and then we ran up to the bridge thing, and both got hit by this wave. We had expected it to be a mist, or at the most a shower, but the water just came up and slapped us. She was wearing a white shirt, so I was trying to make her a toga out of Flora's towel, and then this stampede of guys came, and we were laughing so hard, I almost peed my pants, but no one would have known, because I was already dripping. Christina popped up, after her little ride, and she got all wet too. She was wearing all white, though, so I just kind of walked in front of both of them with my arms outspread, like a giant starfish. Then, Christina, Flora and Jane ran off, and Jessica and I went to Drop Zone. We were both kind of nervous, and to make it worse, we were bumped off by some handicapped people, so we had to wait and watch two groups get off with their hair all fluffed out. But it was a lot of fun. More fun than we expected, after we watched Tsion wobble off, looking really frazzled. Tons of fun. I would have done it again, and I think we're supposed to get together to go again before summer's over. Yay! On the last day of school, before the advancement, it was kind of sad, but I didn't cry that much until after school. Jodi, Ro and I hung around afterwards, in Mr. Maidlow's room, to "help" him. We just wanted to stay, though. I went to the track to empty out his little sand bin, and watched Mr. Croghan's class launch their water balloons. It was kind of sad to witness them doing what we had done a year ago, and just remember all the fun we had. It's like things are coming to an end. April's leaving, and Becca's leaving, and Ally's leaving... And Cissy's really leaving. I guess all good things have to come to an end. What makes me really sad is that I didn't really care for it while it lasted. It was kind of a chore to come to school and wave to people and open my horrible locker ("My locker"), but now I'm going to miss it. Okay, there's my saddest moment in my whole Ujournal. I think. Well, on a happier note, I watched Rat Race yesterday. It was kind of funny. It was also kind of stupid, but I think a lot of people overlooked the stupidity and only told me about the funny parts, so I was expecting a lot more than I saw. I think that guy and that girl looked really cute together... the innocent guy and the helicopter pilot. I can't remember their names. Jenny Lin also started. I liked it better last year, and there were a lot more people, but it's still wonderful. It feels good to be playing in an orchestra over the summer. Oh, and I have a violin recital coming up. I was also accepted for convention, for Certificate of Merit, so I have to go to Santa Clara to play my Bach (Backkkkkhhh) on July 6. There's my musical life for you. It's one o'clock, and I think my dad is taking me running tomorrow, so I'll update on my summer plans next time. Oh, and here's something cute.  urlLink http://INSERT-YOUR-NAME-HERE.youaremyfriend.com/  Dont' click on that. You're not supposed to leave in the INSERT-YOUR-NAME-HERE. Well, I guess you could, but what I really meant was for you to really put your name in. First name, first and last name, whatever. It doesn't really matter.
