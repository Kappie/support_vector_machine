As I was saying-  You may think you know me but you really don't.   *~What you are about to read is a little secret between you and I, use it wisely.*~  First of all, I absolutely love myself. This may not seem aparent but its totally true. Like when I do something good, make myself happy, or even if I am super sad. I do this thign where in my mind I yell "GROUP HUG!" Then I hug myself...this may seem kinda weird, but what can I say. It makes me happy. I did it today in Sara's car because I needed some cheering up! :D  Second....I do all these weird things in ym head...I tell myself jokes and make myself laugh... :D Its greta to be happy! Hahahhahahah  Well...thats about it for my blogging today :)  Love, Lauraaa
