I am going to college for history and I am also a pro wrestler. I have been wrestling for around 6 years (including backyard wrestling) and last November I was in my first live show in front of an audience. I enjoy talking on the phone, watching movies, going out, eating dinner out, and cuddling up with that someone (if I ever find her). I am 5'3 with blond highlights and natural dark brown hair, and hazel eyes. If I sound interesting to you, email me back, we can talk online or the phone sometime. If you get to know me, hopefully you will see my randomness. I also have a puppet (a real one, not a sex term in this case)  My name is Dave. I am 30 from Quincy, Ma and single. I am looking for someone nice, fun and open-minded to meet that is also tired of the games drama and dating scene. I am also an affectionate person and like the same quality amongst others in a woman. Write back when you have a chance.  that sounds awsome :) tell me more (I'm 23m/boston/smart~150IQ)  I am a chef so pies sound great.....I love pies....if your still interested in getting together send a reply here is my pic ...I also have a cam if you dont like the pic  I can be your friend if you make apple or pumklin pies.  Tired of cooking for everyone else for a change.  I have a big house with large kitchen.  Hello...   Pie is my weakness...cake not so much..."somewhat neurotic recently emotionally-scarred girl" huh? We sound very similar you know. Except your a woman and im a man...It took 7 operations to get there, but now im up and running... Seriously though, iv read cragslist for years (Its amazing) and bought my bicycle w craigs but have never had the desire to respond to one of these ads. I am needing to meet a few people other than work friends. I thought your ad was funny...anyway...Im sure your going to get a million responses to your ad and im unsure of how to make my response stand out...  Anyway, im 29 white guy 5'10 and cool as a cucumber... what do you look like? what kind of person are you? Send a pic if you want...Ill send one back(if i can make this friggin' camera work), its not required though...        Ben.... P.S. Im a Bartender/Restaurant manager sometimes screw up!!!
