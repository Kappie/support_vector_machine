The Illini have made it past round two (sorry KD, I know we beat MSU in round 1 but ya'll put up a good fight) and are now up against none other than............DUKE.  dum dum dum......keeping fingers crossed-the Illini at their best could very well beat these guys, they've got a GREAT team this year, but Duke is hot stuff, so we'll see...the cards are stacked against us but during March Madness, all bets are off-UAB already knocked out Kentucky, and Stanford got beat as well, both considered favorites, so we shall see.   Matt Diller   Is the new Student Trustee for UIUC!  You deserve a shoutout-congratulations! And congratulations to the UIUC campus for proving once and for all that PEOPLE LOVE CHIEF! Hail to the orange, hail to the blue...hail alma mater, ever so true!   Vera Bradley handbags   ...are becoming an unhealthy obsession.  Would someone help me, please!     urlLink
