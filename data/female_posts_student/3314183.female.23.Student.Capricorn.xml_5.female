Love will gradually erase past hurt from my current system. It will remain in my permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt my life no more.  Love will eventually overcome my low self-esteem but first, I have to take grudge and resentment away for they prevent me from experiencing the ultimate power of love. But I don't know how to...  The word is forgiveness. The power of forgiveness is miraculous.. really it is.. I have to forgive before I can love again. And I have to learn to love myself before I can love others. To realise my worth, To acknowledge my limitations, To remove self-criticism, to empty it. To make sure it never comes back ever again. And then peace, contentment and smiles will fill my life once again.  You are so right my dear smu fren, I am a girl who will not be afraid to love again despite past hurts. And I thank God for that.
