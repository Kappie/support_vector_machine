Or I've just totally flipped... Yup, even psychotic blood thirsty people have 'aww' days. Or maybe they're 'i can't be arsed to get up and go get the gun' days. Anyway, about things: See from a two sided mirror. That's my worldy piece of advice for today. *crap huh?* Well you're the one who didn't put the 50p into the slot!
