Last night I worked and my Chinese manager had no idea about three of us moving to grocery, and he was very very mad. However, I'm not on the schedule for next week for sacking (and the other 2 people are) so I dont know what's going on. I'm still looking for another job.   This weekend my sister is coming home. I'm excited. But, Saturday I have state show choir, so I have to get up at 4 AM, but return home in the early afternoon. I'm excited for show choir competitions to start. They're so much fun!   My New Years Resolution to exercise more is starting to die down. I think I'm going to go get a YMCA membership thing...which will hopefully make me go lift weights more often.   The school is doing a musical this year, about the ugly duckling or something (from what I heard). I think I'll probably try-out, considering I've been wanting to do the musical for the longest time. I don't know.
