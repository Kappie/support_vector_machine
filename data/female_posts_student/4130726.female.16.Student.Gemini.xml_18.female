I saw this movie called  Wrong Turn  yesterday. It was a suckfest. Don't watch it unless cheesy horror movies frighten you. I had a scary dream last night. There were cannibals and zombies in it. I was trying to escape from a group a cannibal men on a jungle island. In the end I saw the cannibal group leader standing on the ground below me. I tried to tackle him, but he shot me in midair and I landed on him. We both fell into the river. I died, but the cannibal used my corpse as a flotation device. I woke up after the zombie part. I drew a lot of pictures, Ill post them someday. I'm going to go to AA meetings now. Yesterday I thought about things that go together. Salt and Pepper, Peas and Carrots, Ketchup and Mustard, spaghetti and Garlic Bread. Beer and Pretzels? Or is it Nachos? Or Pizza? I don't know. Cheese and Nachos go together. Watch this movie called  Bang Bang you're Dead . Its a good one. I got to go.
