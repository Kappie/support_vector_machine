I spent the entire morning at work trying to pretend that I wasn't tired. I also spent the majority of the morning trying to convince Posh to convince El Jefe to let us take the day off work on Friday, as it is the national day of mourning and the banks and post offices will be closed. Even though Jefe is not even going to be there, as he is going to opening night Van Hagar- I mean, Van Halen- in North Carolina, I don't think my idea is going to fly. Pooh.  I feel really, really sad about Ronald Reagan dying. I mean, he's the first president I can remember (vaguely) and my parents thought he was like a god. Hell, most people in the South did, seeing as how you can't swing a dead cat around here and not hit a Republican. It's like a piece of my childhood has died. I admit it. I cried when I heard about it (then again, I cry at everything, so... not a good example).   I still haven't heard from MUW. I wonder if I got in. The woman in Admissions said it would basically be a straight readmission and then I could contact the financial aid office to make sure they received my FAFSA and my student loan forms. I also applied for work-study. I'd rather work on-campus than off.  Call of the day: A Mexican guy calls in, says he wants to know what "youse peoples" are going to do for him (which is actually more Jersey than anything, although this guy was from Arizona). I explained that he called us in March asking the same question and our company still has the same function as it did then. And when I continue to talk, he starts to interrupt me with "Miss, miss..." over and over again, though it sounds more like "Meeeeese, meeeeeese..." So I keep talking over him like I can't hear him, because he is really getting on my nerves, and he keeps it up. "Meeeese, meeeese..." So finally-  "Sir, what can I do for you, since you are intent on interrupting me this morning?"  "What are youse peoples going to do for me?" *Sigh* "Didn't we explain this to you when you called in March?" "I dunno." "Do you remember calling our company?" "No." "How'd you get the number?" "I dunno." "So you just woke up this morning and said, 'Hmm. I think I'll call this random number today just to annoy people.' Is that it, sir?" *Pause* "I dunno." *Bigger sigh* "Do you know  anything , sir?"  I deal with these kinds of people on a daily basis, folks. I can't wait to get a real job.
