I apologize for being THAT GIRL and you know which one I am talking about.  I apologize for reading into things too much.  I apologize for actually finding myself giddy at times.  I apologize for getting worked up over absolutely NOTHING.  I apologize for sounding like a complete and f-in moron.  I can't get over myself and my f-in issues that really aren't issues at all.  But rest assured I am done.  I am over it.  I will never speak of it again and we will just let it go because if I have to hear myself bitch about my f-ed up "situation" which really isn't even a "situation" at all I think I might have to cut out my tongue or something.  Gross right?  Well you'd be thinking the same thing if you were as lame as I have been.  Even though this might sound a bit humorous I am actually being 100% serious.  You have no idea how f-in pathetic I have been again recently and I am so done.  I'm over it and if I am really not I will be soon.  It's time to stop being THAT GIRL.
