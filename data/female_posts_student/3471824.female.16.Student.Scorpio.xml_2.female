One good thing is that I found out what I needed to do in Pokemon gold today (hey, the story and show suck, but the game isn't all that bad. Plus I don't have anything better to do), which is defeat the gym leader in Goldenrod city. I could've sworn I already did that...but everything in the game itself seems to disagree. Ah well, it'll be a snap anyways. My quilava, Fred (I name all my pokemon monotonous, boring names for no reason at all), is around level 32, and all those people who challenge me have wimpy pokemon that are around level 10! Hah! Pathetic!  But enough of my gameboy rambling. It's probably boring everyone to death. Not that anyone would be reading this anyways... I wish I could fully retreat into my own world, just to get away from this torture called life. If this is all life is, then I don't want to live at all.  Whoever said 'better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all' was just trying to make themselves feel special. It's exactly the opposite!  Just a few more hours of school left. And then I can go home! And go on the computer! Of course, I'm on one right now, but we're not exactly permitted to play games at school (well, duh. It's SCHOOL). Most people play games anyways, but that's usually when they're not in the classroom when the teacher is practically looking right at you. That's just asking for trouble. And I'm not too fond of getting caught playing games and being sent down to the office and getting a lecture from the vice-principle who probably doesn't even know my name or remember me. So I'm writing in my blog- hey, it's not like I have anything better to do. Oh, yeah, and I'm writing a list of roleplaying stereotypes, just to vent some anger. Here it is so far: Roleplaying stereotypes/clichés/over-done things 1)	Assassins 2)	Ridiculously attractive runaway elf princess warrior ‘maiden’ sluts 3)	Killing for stupid reasons 4)	Vampires 5)	Big, strong; masculine heroes who go off on whirlwind adventures and save the world too many times to count; screw half a million women who practically worship him; seduce some virgin empress, sleep with and then abandon her; Has rippling golden hair, perfect teeth and loads of charm; Becomes rich in the process; is a strong defender of ‘good’; and has some magical sword with a long and majestic name. 6)	Mary-sues in any gender 7)	Young, heroic, brave wizards with half a million females madly in love with them   Yup, that's all I've come up with so far. And they all REALLY tick me off. Vampires and Assassins have to be THE most over-done of all those though. I mean, come on! In all the rps I've ever been in, only a handful of other characters have been something other than a vampire or assassin! Seriously, can't they be at least a BIT more original!? It's not like I actually go LOOKING for vampire/assassin rpgs and join them just so I can whine about how many of them there are! The only good rp I've ever been in with vampires or assassins is this one on Elftown called Lethargy. In that, there's a total of one human (Mortis), around ten vampires and/or assassins(Kula, Eve, Wulfgar, Gelina, Jahn, someone or other....), and only ONE character of another race- my character (Syth). And there's no-one playing an 'evil' character, aka antagonist. NO PC ANTAGONISTS! NONE!! NONE!!! ZERO!! NIL!!! Z- Okay, I think you get the point. Even Mortis, who is-or was, I can't figure it out- a vampire hunter, has joined the 'good' side with the rabble of un-original vampire characters! Well, then again, so have I. At least for now. If I feel like it later on, I might decide to throw a wrench in the good guys' plan and join the 'dark side'. My character is pretty flexible in regard to loyalties- nobody really trusts her much, and she trusts them even less. Oh, the joy of messing with other peoples' plots- OH, SHUT UP!!!!!!! Ahem. Sorry. One of the people in the classroom was being sick.  Like I was saying, my character's pretty distrusting. That's partially because she's anti-social. In most of the rps I join, I use Syth as my character. That's because I have a really lousy memory, and it's hard to remember all sorts of different character names for a million rps (I join alot of 'em. Yes, I need to get a life), so by using the same character for all of them, it saves alot of effort. Syth's a half-elf. Well, technically more of a half-demon...
