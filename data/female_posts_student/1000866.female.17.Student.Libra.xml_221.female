It's just one of those, "blah" days. I think I'll probably go make myself some grilled cheese, and just, read my book or watch tv. YaY! Mmmm.....grilled cheese. I'm so addicted to that stuff. I really am. I think I need to get on a better sleeping schedule, but even if I do, I'll go off it again in MI. So, I guess there really isn't much of a point, because I refuse to go to bed at 9 every night when I go. Tra la la. I'm in a weird mood. Quite a weird mood. Hmmm, I just flung my pony tail thing across the room...Wow, I'm so weird. There's nothing really to type about. I still havem't decided, although I did find something out that could be helpful. Eh, I think I should just forget everything and wait til college. YaY college. Maybe there will be mature guys there. I hope....Joanne's lucky, but it's funny. I don't know how they are going to be apart a whole year next year. Joanne really misses him and it's only a week that he's gone now.I have faith in them though. I think they're going to be one of those high school couples that makes it, and actually stays together. They're like, made for each other. I'm really happy for both of them. :) Anyway, I think I'm going to go make my grilled cheese now, and read or something. Hmmm, I never sign this thing anymore. Oh well.
