So many lyrics. Jesus. I need something to do. Maybe I'll call Anna. Apparently, we will be hanging out "all over June." Hahahahaha. I wonder if May 31 is too early. Right now, I think I'll talk to this thing for a while. There are only about twenty or so people online, and most of them I don't really talk to anyway. What have I done since the last entry?  Thursday  - Got up, went to the mall with Sarah. Hahaha, twelve hours after our bonding. So, yeah, that was hot. We got birthday presents for my Jewish girls. I found it entertaining that we managed to knock over the display of thongs. And that we took my present and wrapped it sitting in Starbucks. Those boxes from Delia's look like spaceships. Then we came back here and made cards until Sarah's mom picked her up. After that, I cleaned myself up and went to Becca's party. So I got to see my tree stump kids among others. And there was more than one scandal to be had. But overall it was great. When I got home, I stayed online until 3:30 in the morning talking about life with Chip. My mom thought I was fucking crazy. She was right.  Friday  - Completely lost track of time. I was going to go to Shelley Lake but it was really too late by the time I woke up and I couldn't really find a ride. I watched Pleasantville. There really isn't much about that movie that I don't love. Yeah, not much else to say about that. Then, I went to Mary Alice's house. We had some good conversation and pizza down the street. When we got back to her room, she switched the light on and it burned out. So she turned on her lava lamp and her flamingo light, and that really just made the pillow talk even better.  Saturday  - Well, I went to Hanna's house and watched MTV. Then her father took us to see Kill Bill Volume 2. Oh, my. It was FABULOUS. Seriously, what a wonderful production. Stuff like this is the reason I have survived this far in life. It was funny because there's a lot of dialogue in the movie, and often there's no music so it is pretty quiet. We could hear the music from the trailers in neighboring theaters. Hanna turned to me and said "I hear Harry Potter!" The violence is not so pervasive but it is more realistic. Whatever, I still loved it. After that, I went back to Hanna's house and enjoyed a low-carb dinner. The Newmans and I went on a walk around the neighborhood. I love them all. It was perfect outside and that made me happy. Hanna and I talked about Kill Bill and how we pity people who won't see it just because they cannot see past the violence. Hahaha, we are so smug. It's true though. It's amazing what you can miss out on just because you are too apprehensive. Then somehow we got to talking about religion. She brought up some really good points, and it made me think. We came back to what Serendipity says in the movie Dogma, that it doesn't matter what you have faith in as long as you have faith. Sigh. Once we reached the house again, her father took us down to Helios and then I went home. Mary had arrived earlier that day while I was at the movies. She drove down from Maine in the Memorial Day Weekend traffic. I've missed that kid. Oh, and then I talked to Becca on the phone. That was a good day.  Sunday  - I went with my mother and sister to JC Penney for a new mattress. Mary and I ended up sitting on one of the couches waiting for my mother to finish paying and whatnot. She set my watch to the right time, a feat that no one has yet managed. I might have to write it down to remember for next Daylight Savings. She convinced me to go see Troy again with her. So I did. And it was...the same as the first time. It's not really the kind of movie where you can catch more details in a second viewing.  And now it is Monday.  And all I have done is write a long entry. I am such a hypocrit. Just the other day, I was saying to Becca that it is boring to read five pages of random crap in people's blogs. And now I have typed five pages of random crap for people to read. I feel kind of bad. But, I am bored! Oh, well. I'm sure I will be back soon.
