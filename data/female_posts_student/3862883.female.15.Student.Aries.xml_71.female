It had borne "the dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires" (page 8). The author describes the river with a solemn air of respect which makes us, the readers, realize its importance in British history. As we read the story, we start understanding what was happening inside the minds of all of the sailors who were in the eve of a great adventure.
