I can attend the Farewell gathering which held specially for the Form 5 library prefects.  2. When I crossed a road, I was NEARLY hit by a car, it was just an inch away from me. I could feel the car. If I've not enough lucks today, I might be in the hospital now. 3. When I took the bus home, I bought a RM1.00 ticket as usual. I was given a ticket which number is 7932. Guess what does it mean? Try to add up all the digits in the number. 7+9+3+2 = 21 !!  What is so special with the ticket? I was told by a friend that I will have a chance to make a wish after I have collected 3 tickets which the addition of all the digits are equal to 21. Although some will think it is silly. However, I believe it even though I think it might be not true. It can be a hope, a wish, a dream or even a belief. Is there anything wrong with it?  Am I lucky today? Yes I am.   P/s: Today is my birthday (Count it according to the Chinese Calender)
