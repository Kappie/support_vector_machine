Time to leave, when Richard suddenly realizes that he doesn't have his keys on him. We looked everywhere: on the couch where he and Daniella had been sitting, in his car, on kitchen counter.. We looked everywhere !  Then we thought maybe he left it in Jeff's (Jeff = Richard's roommate) truck because they were outside chatting earlier in the evening.    Kevin, who had stayed around also, ended up driving the three of them (Richard, Daniella and Mike = they all rode together) home. Brian and I strip and go to bed. At 2:45 AM we are sound asleep (totally) when the doorbell rings. I didn't even make an attempt to get up. Besides, I was feeling too lazy (and sleepy) to put my clothes back on. Brian scrambles to put his bristols (clamdiggers for men) on. From my half-closed eyes I get a glimpse of Mike as he walks past the door.    "What was that about," I mumble as Brian returns to the bed. "Richard's keys weren't in Jeff's truck," Brian tells me. "They're checking the yard right now."    The following day I find out that Richard had found his keys (thank, God ! ). It was laying in the grass out on our backyard all along ~~ where they had been rough-housing (Richard got a birthday-beating.. It's supposedly a tradition between Richard, Jeff and Mike from way back when.. The three of them went to high school together). Brian paid for it that day. He has to wake up early and be at work by 6:00 AM. He was late. He didn't get in trouble, though.. I don't think. At least, I hope not.
