Yes, that's right. In 4 more days school will start.  The thought of going back to that hellhole I so dearly know as high school, makes me want to throw myself from the roof. I would do it, but I'm not sure it's high enough to cause certain death. Maybe break a few bones.  Hmm, that should at least keep me out for at least a good week or so..........  Oh nevermind, I'll have to go anyway.  I really don't know where the days have gone. Summer went by way to fast for my liking. Which is strange, cause I'm usaually bored to death during vacation (with that not having a life and all), but this vacation was different. I didn't even have one of those akward "hmm, i'm so bored i wish i was back a school now....." eposides. Well I had one, but I blame it on the heat (you will never ever witness me saying I want to go to school, willignly, anyone who does should seek help immediately).  I really should get over my aversion towards school. That  would  be the mature thing to do. Then again, "me" and "mature", don't really hit it off well.  My friends think I'm crazy not to want to get back to school. Actually, my friends are  estatic  to get back to school (note: get new friends). It's probably because most of them are athletic or into clubs and stuff like that. I've never really understood the concept of spending more time in school because you  wanted  to. Someone would have to put a gun to my head, and threaten to eat all the startburst in the world for me to actually  think  about joining an after-school activity.  My mom thinks I should join as much programs as possible for two reasons. 1) When I go to college it will look good on my applications 2) I need to get out more. And get something called a social life.....  I would, but I much rather spend my free time with a tv remote than with the kids at my school. Simply for this reason I could have a much more meaningful converstation with my remote control, then any person at my school.  Hmm, maybe I don't give the people at my school enough credit. They are good for some things. Like gossip for example. I mean, I guess it's always nice to know who's giving who a blow job in the back of the school bus......................... Okay I really suck at the "benefit of the doubt" thing.
