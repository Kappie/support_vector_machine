This movie was the best, i hoped it never ended. His voice was much more darker than before. Puberty....   I believe in the forth movie he (Daniel Radcliffe) will have a romantic story with Cho Chang. But i dont know her. I guess i just have to wait for the forth movie. I'm excited.  I watched the movie with my mom and dad, vj, kayla, and my friend AnnShelley.
