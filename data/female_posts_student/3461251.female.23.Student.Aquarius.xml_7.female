I've tried everything but things just don't feel the same -- Nothing seems the same anymore after Pap passed away. I'm not even sure why; It's not like we were in Michigan that much to enjoy time with him or maybe I'm just feeling guilty? I dunno! I sure wish I could figure it out.      I just wanna hide under the blankets until the first of the year -- I wonder if thats even possible?! I don't even want to go to Michigan for the holidays because I feel so uncomfortable with myself right now or more like I just feel like a huge failure compared to all of them or just flat out jealous.Maybe someday all of this will change....
