So I stayed at school until 4:15 when the bus came. Before that, all of us were starving, so Squeeb had a pizza delivered to school! Haha it was hilarious.  So then we go on the bus. That was probably the best part of the trip haha. Me, Claire, Emily, Squeeb, Brett, and Matt all talked and played games and whatnot haha. On the way home we played this game that Squeeb taught us that I SUCKED at! And now I finally figured it out and feel like a retard haha. But it was great. Oh and we won the game 65 - 28. :-D So I'm probably going to go on Saturday.  Today I got my geometry test back and I got an 82%!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!!!!! I am so happy. Hehe. Tomorrow is FRIDAY!!!
