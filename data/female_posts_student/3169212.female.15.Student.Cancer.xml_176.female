If you drink all the time, it's not a special occasion, and it takes away that pleasure of that knowledge. Doesn't rum have a higher concentration of alcohol than beer?  Again, it's the British people that don't know proper grammer. (Sorry, Jedi master, but your grammer   is   better than hers!)  Oh, we could have plenty of fun conversations. So who thinks Miroku (  Inuyasha  ) and Hoshi (  Enterprise  ) would make a cute couple?  *sighs* Baka (and I mean that in every possible usage of the word), you do realize that for any of us to understand, you're gonna have to be speaking English, "Ancient Egyptian", German, Italian, or maybe Spanish, possibly French. Some might remember bits and pieces of Latin. I'm very proud of knowing two words of Japanese. Any more and it's beyond me.
