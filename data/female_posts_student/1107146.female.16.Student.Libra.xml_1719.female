(Akk on two weeks tho, *sob*. ) (Well, you can always have "study groups to go to  elsewhere " every day for the next two weeks.) (Early exam preps, you see.) (Yes.) (heh)  (So guys...) (There's going to be a formal day for Homecoming.) (So the obvious question is, "Will, gonna wear a zoot suit with me?) (Heheheh.) (For crying out loud, how many times in life to you get to wear a zoot suit?) (So hell yes, I am.) (And Western Day is going to be cool too.) (I should bring a real cow, talk about school spirit.)  (I dunno about Super Hero Day tho.) (I was thinking about going as Death Man.) (Just so I can wear an impermeably dark hood and not have my face seen and easily sleep whilst sitting up.) (Altho I heard it's going to be 80s Day instead.) (In which case, I'm going to cry.) (Ya know...get the 80s hair going, and glam rawker makeup on.) (Hahahaha.)  (Aww crap I just noticed...) (I didn't post anything wholly relevant to the whole of the BLog.) (Craptastic.) (Umm well...) (Uh...) (How 'bout them Titans?) (Peach tea is really good.) (Cats are obviously superior.) (I never really vocaled on that but yes.) (Cats > Dogs) (Altho Couscous > Everything) (So it's up to you all to decide.)  (I need a new ending.) (How about some random rhyming words for no apparent reason?) (Hardy har.)  (Nonagons and nuptuals, friends.)
