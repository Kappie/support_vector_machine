Yea we used to be tight,  Sharing all sorts,  Now we turned the friendship down a notch, Put downs were present, Our friendship again descended, Slowly spiraling down the drain, This problem is becoming a major strain. I know this poem doesnâ€™t make sense to the old brain.  Where to go what to do, This relationship takes another twist to soon, June 2005 will come to soon, Leaving, Returning, You never know this friendship misleads you.  peace Out
