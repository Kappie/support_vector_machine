Today Jeanette was talking to Adan and she overheard him telling David about how he was confused about whether he should still talk to us or if he should drop us, as if we were objects. That pissed me off, and Jeanette too, so right now she is on the phone with him telling him shit. Camille is here, and she was confused when Jeanette told me that ever since the Adan situation happened she can't trust me anymore. She said it's one of the most horrible feelings in the world, and to me it felt like shit hearing her say that. Adan kissing me at the movies, and me kissing back is at the top of my list of the most stupid things that I've done. I'm not stupid, and I've noticed that ever since Jeanette found out about that day she's acted different towards me. It seems as if she is holding back anger, and she's rude to me. That's the whole reason I slapped her, I didn't mean to slap her hard, it's just that she was being rude, and I was tired of her being rude to me...it's how she's been for a while. I had already told her that there was something wrong with her lately, but I was trying to just shake it off I guess. Well I can in a way understand that it bothered her that we kissed, but it's not like she's with him. She was with him for a day....and then it's not my fault that he was so hurt that I dumped him after we had only been seeing eachother for two weeks. It was two weeks! That's all.....it hardly even counts as a relationship, actually to me it doesn't at all, let alone   one   day.
