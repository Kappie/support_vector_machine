For a good start to the weekend, i slept in until 10:30am today!! Man, it was good. I haven't done that 4 ages. It was my attempt to catch up on the weeks, months, years of lost sleep. 2day I have to force myself 2 do schoolwork, which is actually what I should be doing now, but you know, who wants to write about how their major work fits into the four frames, subjetive, cultural, structural and post-modern. Yawn! Can you say boring? But i gotta do it, or Criddy will fail me, ahh, ill get round 2 it eventually. 2nite is Jess's 15th b'day party! Yay. :D We're going 2 Pino's Pizzeria and then after there is a sleepover party at Gem's with Loz, KC, Mel, Gem and I. Yay. Fun. We're gonna stay there 4 the day on Sunday, and I think we're going 2 Chatty to get Boost but I'm not sure, meh, we'll figure something out. Then I leave 4 Church dance, then Ernie, then Church, then home again, then SCHOOL! ahhh...crap I've got a French exam, I almost 4got bout that. And through ALL of this we've gotta make up a dance 4 Middle School Performing Arts Evening...ahhh, i hope we get 2 make it in time, because i really wanna be in it this yr! Oh well, hope y'all (hehe i luv that word) hav a great weekend too!
