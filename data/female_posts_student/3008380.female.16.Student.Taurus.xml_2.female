This just sucks ass now, I have an hour till my mom gets home to take me to my appointment, so I'm just hanging out until the hell comes. I won't stop moving today.   It wasn't really a fight, but Joel and I sorta got upset with each other last night. I'm just totally running out of patience. THAT'S why I needed to sleep in. But no, now I have to give my friends a whole week more of Jordan's Bitch Syrup. It's GRRRRRRReat!
