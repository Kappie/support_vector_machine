I hate being on Earth.   Oh, and I looooooooooooooooooove Eric Nelson! (No, no, not that way, no, no. You know. And if you're you and that you particularly--yes, that you!-- you, indeed, my dear you, do know!)  Oh, indeed, the caffeine has worn out, it's been a long trip, and for once I totally adore Newnan as I relate the word to "comfortable bed--yay--woo!"
