As part of the construction of a new Channel Tunnel Depot at Leyton Temple Mills the railway company had proposed to remove the bridge and not to replace this ancient right of way. However, after a concerted campaign which involved a petition signed by over 2,000 local residents and a public meeting attended by 200 people Channel Tunnel have withdrawn their plans and the footbridge is to remain for the time being as the development is being scaled down. Neil, Clyde and myself are now pressing for improvements to the bridge to be made - for example making it accessible by cyclists, those in wheelchairs and with pushchairs - and for a commitment to be made that when the depot is further developed in the future the right of way will be protected. As the local councillor for the site I am also trying to set up a "Friends Group" for Marsh Lane to get local people involved in planning for the future of this greenspace and our first public meeting will be held at the Eton Manor Running Club in Marsh Lane on Tuesday 27th July 2004 at 8.30pm. All interested residents are welcome to attend and I will post to this blog with developments on both the friends group and the footbridge as and when they happen. The campaign set up its own website which can be found here -  urlLink http://www.eton-manor.com/saveourbridge .
