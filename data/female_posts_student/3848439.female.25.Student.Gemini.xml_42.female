Every time I go to the main web site, it keeps asking me for my user name and password and my user name and password and my user name and password.  Blech!  For now, I've discovered a few back door ways to get into the blog, but they aren't always reliable.  So forgive me if the constant virtual verbal diarrhea slows down a bit.  I intend to make you all suffer as much as possible with this puppy.  Dang technology!  ::end whine::
