Aww, how sweet is that?  *rolls eyes*  Anyhow, so I didn't get anything at the mall. Nothing. Which is odd for me, usually I get SOMETHING. But I'm going back Sunday, and I saw a bunch of stuff I wanted, and stuff for my room.   I wanna order my laptop in the next couple weeks, so I can fiddle with it before I leave.   I am tired, so I am going to bed soon. I got up at 2...how the fuck am I tired?  PS: KRISPY KREME MAKES THE BEST DOUGHNUTS EVAR!!!!11111111111
