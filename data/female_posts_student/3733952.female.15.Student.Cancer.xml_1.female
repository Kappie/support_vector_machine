They had a nice little paddle boat and a sprinkler that I would always play with. Mother's friend had a lake cottage that we always went to also. There I would play in the sand, go swimming, go tubing.. stuff like that. About six summers ago, my family finally bought a cottage of our own, on the same lake as Mother's friend. The lake is called Snow Lake. We go up there every weekend during the summer. The cottage is really nice, 4 bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths, and a nice boat. We go tubing ALL the time. It's like our life. Even if it's freezing cold and cloudy, we are out on the tubes. At night we go to the ice cream shop, play cards, build a fire, make smores. Sound fun to you? I bet.  Let's play use-your-imagination again. One weekday you get an invite to a friend's pool party which is on Saturday. You ask Mother if you can go. "No, we'll be at the lake." You beg and you plead, but it's still no. So Friday afternoon, you pack your things and head to the lake for another fun-filled family weekend. Before you get in the van, you ask one more time if 'Best Friend' can come too. "No." So there you are, stuck in the van with Family. Dad, Mother, and Sister are having a very LOUD conversation, Brother is playing his Gameboy with the volume on high, and you are trying to read. Imagine the annoyance! But this is just the beginning. After driving for 45 minutes, you finally get to the cottage. You hurry and grab your bag, run up to your room (which is practically a closet in Sister's room, no joke), hurry back down the spiral stairs, and do your job of sweeping spider webs off the porch and dock. Once that's done, you grab your book and plop a squat on the couch. Finally, some reading time.. WRONG. Brother and Sister run in and turn the TV on to some stupid cartoon show. You try to take refuge in Brother's room (your room is only used for changing), but the door doesn't close all the way and the volume is up as loud as it goes. You give up reading and put your swimsuit on because you see Dad taking the tube to the boat. So now here you are, on the boat, FREEZING, and they are going to shove you on an inflatable piece of plastic and drive you across the water. You take turns with Brother and Sister, it's still cold, but it's not bad. You're sitting in the tube, Sister talking away next to you (2-man tube) and you start to think of what others are doing. You wonder what it would be like if 'Best Friend' was there too. Now it's time for dinner, not so bad. And now you get to do the dishes while everyone else has fun doing something else. When you're done, you walk into the TV room to find Brother and Sister lying on Mother, the babies. You go up to Brother's room (your favorite room) and read. After a while, "Livi, come down here! We're playing cards now!" You go downstairs, sit down, and play a couple rounds of Progressive Rum. At the end of round 3, Brother starts crying and throwing a fit because he has to count his cards. So the game ends. Now you get to go get ice cream! You get back and Dad starts the fire. It's nice and warm. You look at all the stars that you can't see at home, and you think about Jack and how you wish so much that he was there. You can't take the loneliness anymore, so you go inside and go to bed in Brother's room. You don't sleep in closets even if there is a bed. Brother usually sleeps on the daybed downstairs anyway. You say your prayers and get all comfy and- Brother comes into the room. "Out." You must protest. "No, I'm sleeping here." "Fine, but I get this side of the bed." He indicates the side you are on. You move over to the other side, but you take the good pillow with you. You need SOME good thing. After Brother kicks you about 50 times, you finally go to sleep. But only to wake up to: Brother snoring, Brother kicking you, Brother lying on your shoulder, or Brother waking up at 7 and turning on the TV. At 9:30 (way too early) Mother wakes you up for a nice breakfast. You eat, take a shower, and put on your suit. You are ready for a morning of tubing! You step outside and- IT'S REALLY COLD! But Family is pushing you out the door and into the boat. Finally the sun comes out and it's nice enough to swim for a while. You suddenly remember the party you were invited to. It's taking place right now and you're not there. You think about all your friends and how much fun they are having. You think of Jack and how you could be with him right now if it wasn't for your lake! On the way back to the cottage, you spot Mother's friends. They come back to the cottage with you and you are in charge of making the food for them. You make the food, join them and suddenly the boat takes off and you are stuck for the afternoon. You drive around the three connected lakes for a while. Warm when the sun comes out, cold when it goes away. You stop here and there to visit people who know you but you have no idea who they are. At one of the stops, you stay in the boat while the adults go talk to the people in the cottage. You see on the porch a boy about your age. He is blonde, and sitting in a wheelchair. You look at him more closely and realize that one of his legs is missing. Suddenly you recall the story from last summer of that boy who got ran over by a boat. That was him. You feel sorry for him and then beg Mother to take you home, you're bored and burned. You go home, eat dinner, do the dishes again, blah blah blah. Then you try to read, but have to play cards again. After cards you sit down and watch TV, fighting here and there on what to watch. After a while, you get bored and go up to Brother's room and listen to music. You sit on his windowsill and look out at the lake. You see a bright star and start to think of Jack again. How you wish he was here! When the CD is over, you go to bed. Thankfully Brother is sleeping on the daybed this time. The next day is pretty much like the last. Tubing, boating, TV, cards. FINALLY it's time to go home. Brother and Sister want Mother to sit in the back seat with them, so you are stuck in the front. You turn the music on and all the songs that remind you of Jack come on. You miss him so much. You try to listen to the music but Family is having a discussion about road rules. Grr.. how they bug you! Good. Now you are home, on the computer, and back where you are loved. Thank you for playing use-your-imagination.  Bye!
