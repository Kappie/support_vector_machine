SO he came over and we sat on my porch for a few minutes and talked about postmodernism and silly things. And then we decided to watch TV. And we went to the basement for some reason, and not the one upstairs where other people were.  And see, whenever i make up romance stories in my head, they're  Ã¼berromantic . And my favorite movie-scene kiss is the one that's totally unplanned, the first kiss between two friends who are just talking or fighting or something, where they don't even know what happens. Like they're just sitting there and suddenly they're against each other and they don't even care how.  But then it's kind of funny. Because i went down the stairs first and when we got to the bottom i think i must have turned around somehow, talking about some TV show, and was standing in his way, but we just looked at each other and he didn't stop walking and i felt my mouth drop open and he groaned.   And then his arms were all around me and my hands were on his back and everything else was gone. And it's like this sense of urgency, but also this familiarity. And it's so perfect and sexy and sweet and there's so much to feel.  And then we pull apart and somehow we're not standing up any more, we're lying on the couch and both of us are shaking. And we lay together for a moment, not listening to the TV at all. And he kissed my hair and i was close enough to count his freckles again, and he's crying a little and I can't make him stop. And you want him to stop so desperately because you want this to be a happy movie and you might start too if he doesn't.  But it doesn't matter how much you comfort. And just like before, we talked again and cried again because our parents don't like it, and our friends want to kill us if we mention the other's name, and we're right back to where it left off all those times before.  In the movies, he never leaves after a perfect kiss like that. And you don't ball up on the couch and sniffle because it still smells like him when you wrap yourself in the blanket. Because even as you both apologize, you know you would give anything to hold each other for another five seconds. And in the movies, if he whispered "Just one more time," even as he's apologizing and pulling himself away, you would have one more time and a million more besides. You wouldn't soak his shirt with tears because you know that it's never the last time, that the last time is already through, and that you'll never be this close to it again.  And you wouldn't ever ever cry because you don't know if it's worse that it happened, or that it had to stop.
