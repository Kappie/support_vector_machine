       
       I feel so shallow. Everybody around me makes things seem so deep, so important. I feel like someone who is swimming on the surface. Everything I say seems to be so artificial. Hypocrite is what I would use to describe myself right now. I am so against artificialness and yet thats how I am...I am so fake. it is like I am hiding and putting on a suit, a suit that is not my own. Eventually this lonely mood will pass, and I will be happy or be comforted. or maybe I will just be content. I will just be content with my suit of plastic.
