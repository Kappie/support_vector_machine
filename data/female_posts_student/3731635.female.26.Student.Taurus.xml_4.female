It was actually pretty hot here in Wisconsin (to me) and since I wasn't a good girl about drinking my water, I felt the heat more than usual. I also got my period, too, which always drags me out and I get this crushing fatigue, which I guess is supposed to get better if a woman takes 1200 mg of calcium, plus 400 of vitamin D also. (the jars of vitamins are in my dresser) So I guess the idea of the day is making healthy actions a habit so I have some chance of remembering them. I did go for a walk though, not with my buddy, and only for a half-hour, but at least it was something. I napped most of the day, which felt really good, and did well with food, till my two candy bars in the afternoon. I bought some healthy groceries, and had a nice dinner. Kind of boring day...
