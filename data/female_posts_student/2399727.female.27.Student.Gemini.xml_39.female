Instead of doing much for my ongoing nausea, he diagnosed me with (1) labyrinthitis (inner ear inflammation that will go away on its own in time), (2) blepharitis (infection of the eyelids) and (3) suspicion of hyperthyroidism.  That would explain  so  much about me and I don't know why I was always getting my symptoms treated but doctors were oblivious to the big picture.  I'm speaking too soon.  I won't know if I have it until I hear if my blood test comes back irregular.  As for the blepharitis, I already knew I had that but didn't think a GP could do anything about it.  I'm on Fucithalmic viscous eye drops for it and have to use hot compresses.  Maybe my eyeball won't hurt so much soon... :-)   And to think I was going to cancel that appointment!   MGSA conference today, Mom's birthday lunch at 12.  Bought a second birthday card to bring so I don't show up empty-handed at the restaurant.  Got it home and realized that it said " To the Man I love so much " rather than " To the Mom I love so much ".  Crap.  I don't even have anybody to give that card to. :-(  Went back to pick up my Rx and got a little potted flower instead.  Didn't want to risk another bad card!  More to come...
