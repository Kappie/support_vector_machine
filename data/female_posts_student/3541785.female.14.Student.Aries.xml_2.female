Well,it is about a girl who lives in a village that only allow people who is very happy always be one of a resident there.She was rather a sad girl after being suffering so much in love.No one loves her.She went up to the Sun every day when she is sad and mumble to it...She always regard the sun as her boyfiend..Poor thing.Evertime she likes a guy,that guy will go away for sure just like the sun that always move in the sky. One day,there was a heavy rain near her village.She was so nervous and panic all about it... Everyone in the village were so mad at her as she was crying!! She ran out of her village ASAP and she eventually knock on a guy.The guy was so concern about her that he brought her to his house to give her sweater and warm water and thereforth. As they were sitting down together they introduced themselves.Only then the guy knew about her feelings for the sun. How meaningful the sun is. Suddenly..he popped out a question to her and say " can i be your sun starting from now on?I'LL make sure i will give you sunshine brightly just like the sun you always look to! i Will be keeping you warm always!"who would not be shocked. Only then she realised that miracles do happen to her. And she believes now that...it was the day when the sun stood still for her and will not move away.    When i get my essay back,i shall scan it for u all!!! Give me your comments about this story!
