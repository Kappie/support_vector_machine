But I am going to the church tonight at 3 am to unlock the doors for all my buddies getting back from the Presby. Triennium. So I'll prolly go to bed a 10... Not much time to do anything. So anyway I'm bored so I have decided to fill out one of those survey deals but I think I will post it here b/c no one really reads my Blog anyway so therefore I can tell all and still remain a mystery...        ....Kidding of course     1. Full name: Miss Elizabeth Alice Leslie   2. Are you named after anyone? Yes, infact. My mother's given first name is actually Alice, as was her mother's and her's before her and her's before her. So basically I'm at least the 5th generation of "Alice" and you can bet that my first daughter will also be Alice. And of course my Aunt's name is Elisabeth.   3. Do you wish on stars? All the time. It's more of a nostalgia thing than anything else.   4. Which finger is your favorite? I'm sorry... I love them all the same.   5. When did you last cry? Last night actually. Ask later.   6. Do you like your handwriting? I used to hate it but after saying "I like your handwriting" to so many people and hearing them say "I hate it" I've decided that no one likes their handwriting and it's not like I can really do much about mine so why live hating it?   7. What is your favorite lunchmeat? My Bologna has a first name, it's o-s-c-a-r, by Bologna has a last name, it's m-e-y-e-r. I love to eat it everyday and if you ask me why I saaayyy!
