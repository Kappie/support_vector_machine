Ash: I talked with him... (Nick) Andee: I wondered why someone (aka you) was in a good mood... how was it? Ash: Better. A lot better.. I guess. ARE YOU STONED OR SOMETHING?! Andee: Well... it's definately good things are better. That makes life a little easier, no? I 'm not stoned, persay. I forgot how to spell. Ash: lol.  p.s. Dan is hotttt!!! But yeah, we didn't talk much but he sounded like he had something on his mind. So I'm beyond curious now. But I did tell you about the whole instant messenger ordeal.. (I go on to explain the instant messenger ordeal). I think he's hiding something. Andee: Yeah, no kidding... now I'm super curious! I wonder what it is... Was he all nervous about it? Hmm... I have to know now. Ash: Me too. It's driving me insane! I can't spell either. What do you think he's hiding (if anything)? Andee: I have no idea. Maybe he's a hermaphrodite or maybe he thinks Snydee is hott... lol. Ash: Well, I've narrowed down to a couple possibilities. A) He's SOOOOO in love with me he can barely stand keeping it a secret (lol, what a joke) or B) He thinks me liking / loving him is fucking rediculous. (more than likely) Andee: Maybe he just wants to talk to you about liking him, neither bad nor good, you know? I decided you and I are going to have wild passionate sex right now, k? Ash: Sounds good to me! Perhaps. Then there's selection C. C) He doesn't want to lose our great GREAT  GREAT  friendship over this. Which is almost a joke because we do talk but I'm always too scared to say anything. I'm shy like that sometimes. Damn, Amazing Graze  Andee: Grace.. Grace can make me all warm baby! Ahh! Never again will I take that shit. I was excited that Michelle IM'd me online. She can join the wild passion sex too. Ash: Seriously. I've had some wild dreams about her! o.O lol. Andee: Damn, I'm jelious. Is she 1/2? Wow, that's all rude of me to ask. Ash: I don't know. We made out to give the druken frat guys hard-ons up at Kettering. But we were just joking around. But about the 1/2 thing, I dunno.  Andee: Hmm.. curious. Don't worry that makeout thing is never going to leave my lips.  We went on to plot out a part in the movie where a 3-some takes place between Jordan, Jocelyn, and Jamie.  More to come later... I've got to go and sort some stuff out. Damn, Coldplay is making me really happy for some reason.
