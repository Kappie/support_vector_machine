So last night I broke out my new watercolors to test them on my skin. My hand is still partially green, but that's a good sign because it took so damn long to GET it that way. My family still has no idea of my intentions to greenify myself :D AND THEY WON'T FIND OUT. They just think Michael/Hillary/I are using watercolors in our skit because we're ridiculous, foolish teenagers with no lives.   I don't know, I'm having the most terrible writer's block lately. I wrote a song last night though... I think I'll post it out of lack of other material. HERE IT IS, written at 3 in the morning:  "3 AM"  too late, too long you're pushing me around the bend now close my eyes cause what the hell am i doing wrong all my charms are failing me and i just don't see how to break the walls of your mind  chorus:  cause baby i've been trying to get down deep inside and everything i try becomes more tears to cry you don't seem to care about a thing that i do baby what's it gonna take what's it gonna take ... to get to you?  indifference confuses me and makes me wonder who are you and who am i baby if you loved me would you be this way and could you love me as bad as i love you?  -repeat chorus-  final: my thoughts revolve around you and you can't tell and if you can why do you hide it so well?  -repeat chorus-   Yep. So there's my late-night ramble song. The tune is still a bit fuzzy and I only wish I knew more about guitar (and actually had one). And I'm not that good on piano to compose, so... *makes sound of firework whistling to the ground*
