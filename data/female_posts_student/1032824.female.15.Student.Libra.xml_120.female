I went to school for NPCC training, which is unusual because today is the 3rd day of Chinese New Year. On the other hand, most people would know how committed I am to my CCA, so yupp, it definitely isn't a chore to go when I can interact with my little kids. (Haha, sir Faizal I stole your word :P) Honestly speaking, I love my sec 3s. At first I didn't think that way because I  thought  I would be unable to handle them. But I've made a promise to myself that I am going to do my best in training them to become outstanding NCOs in the near future. As the quote by George Soros goes, " Once we realize that imperfect understanding is the human condition, there is no shame in being wrong, only in failing to correct our mistakes. " No matter how many/few mistakes they've made in the past, as long as they are all willing to learn from them and not commit them again, I would already be satisfied.   I yearn for them to grow up and become good people in the future, serve the nation, be loyal to Singapore, never stop learning and give their best in whatever they do, because as much as I am giving out my 110% in disciplining them, I hope that they will give me their 110% as well.  Training ended not-very-nicely. The Sec 3s were planning to sing Junior Jolene a birthday song, yet I screwed it up by losing a Casio watch which I had borrowed from a Sec 1 cadet. I passed it to Hafiz who was in-charge of one of the stations cos he didn't have a timer, and he brought it to the toilet and left it there. Before we could find it, it was gone.. We combed the entire school thrice, reported to the general office too. No news. * Sighs * I feel  really  bad for losing the watch.. It costs S$60. =\ Val forked out $10 while I paid the kid $50. Also wrote a letter to his parents informing them that I will take full responsibility. Val is right though, money can't solve all problems. I just hope that someone finds the watch..  Somehow....  Somewhere...
