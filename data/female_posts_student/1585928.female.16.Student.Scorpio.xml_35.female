Brenton was slightly F'ed up! so me and him were outside sittin on the steps while he puked and i strached his back! lol aren't I sweet!! (lol matt and julie) (lol Julie I get to go to the waterfall with him for it though!!) so after like an hour of sittin outside talkin and him puking... me and Brenton decide to go inside with everyone, and I was like 'are you sure you can walk inside?' and he was like 'yea' so we get up and start walkin to the door and i hear 'oh shit!' i turned around and Brenton has fallin off the porch which is a good 3 feet off the ground!, so I went over there and I was like 'omg are you ok?' and he was like 'yea i think' so he gets up and we have to sit back down on the porch again so he can puke some more! it was terrible!! poor thing!!, but about 30 min. later we manage to finally make it inside! so then i go to the kitchen to get Brenton some water! and I see someones head in the garage so I bust up out there and I guess my timing was a lil off, haha yall, but anyways... it was matt and julie! ... well Brian's BMW was also in the garage and NO ONE touches his car, well I oh so gracefully managed to trip over a board on the ground and basically dive onto his car at about the same time he dicided to come to the garage! haha it was greatt!! he wasn't madd though!.. that night was greattt!! ... me and Julie were up extremely early Sunday morning! haha? 'was the sun and moon out at the same time?, haha wtf?'.. we are so crazy!!! but anyways... Sunday was pretty boring!  but Sunday night, me and Julie went to margaritas and ate! it was funn! we had 4 waiters! lol then me ...being the fatt ass I am ...broke the bench!, but we arent gonna get into that one!, but don't worry all 4 of the guys that kept coming to our table tryin to wait on us picked up the edge of the bench and put it back on the lil ledge! it was great! lol! well i'm all out of things to talk about!! and I'm on the phone with Josh! so i'm out!oh Happy Birthday Elizabeth, I love you girl!!!
