I had a wonderful surprise history test and then fell asleep during spanish 2. umm in anatomy we had to draw cells! Mrs.Whitworth: "Now we are going to do something fun!" Class: "Movie?" Mrs. Whitworth: " yes" Class: "Can we have popcorn" Mrs. Whitworth: "OH yeah! lets save that for the puberty video its the best!" But yea that was fun! practice felt really good i said something that sounded really dirty but i didnt mean it and im not gonna explain it! so too bad.  What i learned today:  1.the proper word for a fart is "air biscuit" 2.it is impossible for me to take tests with out gum in my mouth 3.dont ever repeat things when people tell you too
