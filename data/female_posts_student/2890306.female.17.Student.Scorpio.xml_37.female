So, I thought I'd update my lil friend here instead; therefore, here I am.  Today has been great so far.  I wore a shirt I recently bought and new necklace I made, and many compliments have been tossed my way.  Who wouldn't have a good day after all that?  It is days like these that make it easy to be optimistic.  On top of it all, the weather is supposed to be divine.  I don't work tonight either, so I will be able to soak it all in.  Perhaps my plans will include sitting outside with a good book and some soothing tea.  Or maybe I'll go get a haircut.  I know you're probably laughing at that last one, but spontaneous events are the spice of life, agreed?  Who knows what I'll do.  That is the best part, not knowing.  *grin*  Now, I will indulge you with a bit of brain food.  I was playing Word Power on the Reader's Digest website and stumbled upon a cool new vocabulary morsel.  Now, if you know me at all, you have noticed my affinity for great words, so I invite you to chew on this one for a while.  Not literally, mind you.  My blog is very sensitive and it doesn't take well to biting.   epigrammatic (adj.)--concise, clever, and witty.
