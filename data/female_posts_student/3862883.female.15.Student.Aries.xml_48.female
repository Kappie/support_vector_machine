So "NO" willard does not have the right to judge kurtz in any way because of this. He might be able to judge him based on his appearence, but as to what he is really like nobody has the right to judge him. Although the man could be completly insane he could be the nicest person in the world. Until you find out what is really going through someone's head you have no right to judge anybody.
