Buuuut he had to leave at lunchtime so the afternoon was spent painting, crying, and crying on my painting.  Argh. SO I've had a headfuck of a day, really. On a lighter note, here's an animation I made a couple of days ago.  I don't think it needs subtitling.    Hopefully I'll have cheered up and pulled myself together by tomorrow. xL
