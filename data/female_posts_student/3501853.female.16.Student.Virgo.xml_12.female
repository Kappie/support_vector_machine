Eh not a lot to say on this thing.."There's nothing I could say that could matter, that could matter enough"-New Found Glory...I just need to apologize to someone. Okay well someone asked to hang out tomorrow and I'm not sure if we are or not cuz I"m supposed to call him but I don't know, I haven't really been following through with plans with people lately and it's not that I don't love them or that I don't want to, I just Idk but anywho..if we do hang out we might see a movie so I wanted to ask Kev if we wanted to and he said no I'm chilling with the crew..and I just broke down and I need to apologize ten fold to him. I made him feel bad for saying something he had no intention or even thought would make me break down but it's little things like that that do lately and I hate breaking down in front of him, I've been trying so hard not to like I just do by myself and try not to talk about it to anyone but I did it in front of him and I made him feel bad and worry. Kev: I'm so sorry.
