Well I thought I was really funny in all my classes, but nobody laughed but me. In English, Dr. Doden said, "Everybody looks like somebody else." And I said, "Yeah, I get J. Lo ALL the time!" And in History, we were talking about WWII and the neutral countries, etc. So I asked, "If you want to be neutral, do you just call up Germany and say, 'Hey Hitler, me and my country are neutral, okay?'" Then people were like, "This is Germany, leave a message at the beep. BEEP: 'Hey Adolf! Hey we're gonna sit this one out, k? Good luck with that war thing!'". Well I'm not sure if people said that, but that's silly and I like it. Study hall was great! Erica asked Talia if it was true that Orthodox Jews can't waste semen. Talia tried to explain it to us that they can't release semen in vain, but of course I had to ask, "Does that mean you have to swallow?" AHH ALLISON YOU ARE SO GROSS! Then I was attacked in the student council meeting. ATTACKED. How come every time a teacher makes fun of me and makes me embarrassed, Ann Kelley is sitting there laughing? EVERY TIME! It's crazy. So Zazu (if you go to CSG and don't know who that is, you really should not ask me cause I'll punch you in the gut, just like Miriam did to Erica in fifth grade!) tells us that elections (ahh the acid in my stomach is churning up, cause I am soo nervous) are going to be like this: speeches on Monday, voting on Tuesday, and finding out on Wednesday. First off, that's just fucked up. I'm sorry, but it just is. It's so stupid, I can't even tell you. So she asked for our opinions on how the voting should go on Tuesday and different things, but she didn't ask us if we liked that idea at all! She just said that the faculty liked it and we were going to try it, next year they could adjust it if this doesn't work. BULLSHIT! I am NOT going to be your damn guinea pig, NO. So I raise my hand, and take a risk to share my thoughts, and say, "As someone who has sat in that chair, and knows how it feels to take a risk like that, it is really nerve-racking. And the last thing you want to do is have to wait three days to find out the results! And I don't know about you, but when I'm really nervous I can't focus on everything else I have to do." Well, you know what, that yatch bastard beeyatch turned it against me. "Well Allison, you're so tense... we have to break you of these habits. In the real world (PS THIS IS HIGH SCHOOL, SCREW THE REAL WORLD RIGHT NOW) you will have to wait. If you apply for a job, you have to wait to find out what will happen." And I said, "Well, at least then the whole high school isn't watching!" Then after the meeting, she came up to me and told me I was so stressed out and she was going to change me and make it better. F YOU BITCH. I am so angry with this, so I'm just going to vent. Let me tell you something, boob job woman, I am nervous and stressed, but that's MY business. And this is a student council meeting; this has nothing to do with Allison Ansari AT ALL. Don't address me and my issues in front of the rest of the council, that's not their business or their cares. You asked for an opinion and I gave you one, and then you attack me. I don't cry and let emotion take over me in front of other people, but I was shaking so hard fighting back the tears, that I almost had to leave. When I told my mom about it that night, I completely broke down. If she even approaches me, I will tell her straight out that she WILL NOT disrespect me again like that, she was completely out of line. I do not fear her, she looks like a bird.  Thankfully, I laughed a lot at SAT class. It's my favorite thing right now, everybody should go out and take it. Our teacher is so dorky!!! AHH we had to do this survey of the program, and for "Additional teacher comments", Chelsea put, "He cool!" LOVE HER. But she distracts me, and I don't pay attention. Then the Indian girl was sitting with this white boy, and Chels and I think they like each other. But the brainy girl is trying to break it up. It's so good to watch the relationship unfold. Chelsea and I were the only ones to get vocab words wrong in the challenge between "This side of the room" and "This side of the room". You know how when you break up into two teams, one might be A and the other might be B. Well our teacher wrote on the board, "This side of the room" and "This side of the room" HE'S A FOOL. The girl behind me didn't know some of the words, so I'd try and shake my head yes or no, but the teacher said, "I see you shaking your head." And I said, "NO, I just got the shakes!" I laughed. A lot of funny stuff happened, but I can't remember.  Today was okay. Nothing was really outstandingly funny. I had a Chem test, but it was easy and I did well and that was exciting. We watched this documentary on this Spanish writer, who we are reading, and she was talking about one of her characters and she said, "He is an Arabian man with a hair lip, I've never met anyone like him." I thought it was really funny, but then I didn't know what a hair lip was, so in reality it's not funny. Alas, I laughed. I had to do flags at chapel, which blew. Lauren Smiley hit something on her way in, I laughed. Then Sally Kurgis read the wrong part of the responsive reading, and everybody laughed. AP Spanish actually was funny. All we did was talk about prom. Erica came in and embarrassed Senor, it was fantastic. Usually at tutoring the kids don't talk to me, but when I walked in one called my name out and we worked together. We did these really challenging math games, and I felt very foolish. Then Libby told me that the Chair Nazi has a (gasp) BOYFRIEND. She recently got divorced, but apparently she's back on the scene. That just bursts any confidence I've ever had, there it goes, wave goodbye.  I thought I was really funny in Elizabeth's car. We were talking about Fall Out Boy, and I said, "They're going to be really big, right after I touch them!!!" It was so gross, but I laughed so hard, cause I think I have to be funny since I descend from the family of Carrot Top, therefore I must be super funny! So, there it is. Oh and then I went to the grocery store, and people were staring at me, because of my uniform. When I was walking out two guys were sitting on a bench, and one hits the other guy and then points at me, LIKE I DON'T SEE YOU A HOLE. WORK IT OUT. Bye.
