I can bareley type! Lol! My dad came home from taking my grandparents to the airport but I didn't even know he was gone so I saw this shadow and I like jumped up and stared screaming. Lol!!! I hope I didn't wake anyone up...man....my hands are STILL shaking!  Any who... When I got home I began to memorize a section of Anne Frank for CYT. I got it allll memorized!!! Yipppe! But then I didn't even have to say it... :/ Oh welll! When my mom got home from taking Hannah to piano she brought me a pepermint milkshake from this little store on the corner called O'Bradys. YUMMMMMM! Then we all went tot CYT. CYT was great fun, of course ;) We practiced thigns for our showcase.  In the middle of our performance I am supposed to start screaming. Lol. I hope I am brave enough to do it. :D Yum fun fun.  Then, right after CYT, my mom and I headed over to portland to go to this Dartmouth thing. I wanna go there soooo bad! You have to be SUPER SMART and SUPER RICH to go there- neither of which I am, so it might not be a possibility ;) It cost 40,000 DOLLARS a YEAR to go there!!! Isn't that crazy???? Its such and awesome school though. Last year they had a winter carnival and they carved a ginat GANDALF out of snow!!! Is that cool or what?!  It was 3 stories tall!!!!! :)  After than we went to burgerville so I could FINALLY eat dinner! It was about 9:30 :D Ë† was HUNRY! I got chicken strips and a PUMPKIN MILKSHAKE! Those are SO stinkin' good. They taste like your eating a pumpkin pie. Yummmm.  Then..I went home. And went to bed! Now I am out of bed. That is all. CD of the day!!!!! Relient K CHRISTMAS!!! Gosh, it rocks. Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!!   Love,  Lauraaaa fantooora AKA....ozzy. :p
