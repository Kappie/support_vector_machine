We sat on my fence and ate popcorn for a while. We painted our nails. Mine are already chipping. Lame. Kelsey's came out cool though. They have polka dots. :D We watched the first half of Donnie Darko but then my Dad stole the TV from us. We walked over to Walmart to buy some icecream (yum). We watched Reno 911. And some other fun stuff that I can't think of right now.   Wheeeee.       I still miss Trey. He comes back Saturday though. YAYAYAYAYAY!
