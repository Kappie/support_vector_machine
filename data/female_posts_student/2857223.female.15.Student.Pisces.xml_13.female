I still can't believe that Simon told her on Tuesday night that she was the best finalist that the show had ever seen; I don't think she was better then Kelly Clarkson or even Ruben or Clay. I actually wanted LaToya to win, and I thought she was the favorite with the judges too. I don't know why the Hawaiian girl AND Diana DeGarmo got through the voting, well, and Fantasia too for that matter, and LaToya got voted off. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU AMERICAN PEOPLE?? lol, just kdding,   Anyway, nothing new, just typing my History Final Term Thesis, it's waaaaaaaay cool.  And I was looking through pics on our computer last night and I found this picture, it's of one of the Golden Retreiver puppies my dog had last spring - what a schweetheart!
