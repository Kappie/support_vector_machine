It totally made me forget about all the shit thats goin on and it was perfect. I saw Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, The Early November, Coheed  Cambria, Story of the Year, Yellowcard, and my super duper favorite of all time NEW FOUND GLORY. I got a shirt and a wallet signed by all of the members of new found glory and i think that was the happiest anything has made me in a long time. it was good. I went with my bestest frined lisa and we had soooo much fun!   im feelin it hard core today tho.  Ive got a shit load of bruses, cuts, im really sore, and my ears are still ringing, but it was def. worth it! I wish that was everyday, like i could follow it becasue it made me happy, i was genually 100% happy and i havnt been like that in a rally long time, it was awesome, im just upset its gone.
