OH NO !!! God. What am I going to do!? There is the IPW [inter-disciplinery Project Work] presentation, which I absolutely hate, the napha test, which I'm absolutely afraid about. I know I can't pass this time round! How can I? I've never ever passed my napha test! and I know I can't...I've been working like mad and crazy to brush up my standing board jump but to no avail. It's no use, do you see that!? Sometimes, there is a glint of hope which disappeared soon after I jumped and I know I haven't met the target. Two common tests next week, English and History - my poorest subjects. Sigh. Then there was the Geography test on tuesday, I think.The Napha test will be on Tuesday too. On that day is also the national day parade rehersal, which probably will be until 6pm...sigh. On friday is a half day, which will be the national day parade of the school. Our band will of course be participating in this upcoming event with much much more and higher confidence than ever. But my clarinet is still under repair, meanwhile, I can use my old clarinet... which is a lot better than the current one, apart from the fact that it is not shining, and I cannot borrow it back... Gee. Life is going downhill for me.
