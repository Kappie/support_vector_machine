Now, people may say yelling is better than being grounded.. but that is the first time in over a year we yelled at each other. I don't even remember why they originally got pissed at me, but I complained and said that everyone in the house was pissed off. Then my mom and I started yelling at each other, she took a shower, and my dad came up to start his bitching spree. He screamed at me. Meanwhile, Henk and Nick sit contently downstairs. I was surprised he didn't hit me, but he lunged at me a couple of times. After I'm terrified and crying, he drags me into their room and continues his rant. I try to explain things, he doesn't want excuses. I'm meek and crying, so scared that I start hyper-ventilating. He's still pissed, but hugs me as I'm this emotion wreck. And everything just hits the fan... Grades, finals, work, friendships, Josh, money, substance abuse, starvation, alcohol... just everything. It all comes crashing down, and I can't stop crying which makes my breathing situation even worse. By the time I told my dad I needed to leave to be alone for a few minutes, my heart was racing so fast I felt as if I was going to die. I was satisfied with my oxygen supply but couldn't stop gulping down air. The pain killers were wearing thin after that. My chest aches and I'm really tired. It feels like something inside of me is broken, I think my ribs might be bruised or something. Before going out to dinner, my dad took me aside again. Fearing the worst was yet to come I braced myself, and started taking deep breaths. Fortunately, he only apologized. He broke down into tears. I've never seen my dad cry before. I accepted his apology (what else was I going to do?), and he sat at the dinner table with a guilt-free conscious. We ate at Smoke House Blues. I left early, after dinner was over but before everyone was done packing up, and went to the park to puke up my food. My stomach hurts so much. My dad told me something strange... he said, "Don't do anything for your mother or I, do it for yourself." But yet this hypocritical statement lead me to ask myself why he wanted me to lose weight, or why they wanted my grades to be at honor roll status. The majority of my work is not for myself. I do like to indulge in many things, but I don't really do much for myself as far as practicality goes. But we need not get into that shit now. I think I'm going to bed. G'night all.
