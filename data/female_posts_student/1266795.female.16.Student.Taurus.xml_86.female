So, basically, Sarah's tired. And hungry. And would come see Ash perform tonight if 1) she wasn't keeling over, drooling half the time, and 2) didn't look like she was caught in a tornado. Sorry, Ash. I'd come if I could promise that I'd stay awake.  On a better note, I finally saw my report card. I was surprised by Means' scores. I got an A+ for the sixth weeks, an A+ on the final (o_0??), and an A+ for semester. Did she do that with anyone else? But, anyway, I raised my cumulative GPA to a 4.050 from a 3.973, which ranks me 7th, three spots ahead of first semester. YAY! And what happened to all the sophomores?? We went down to 658 (or whatever that number was - I don't have the paper in front of me) from 691. That's a big jump.   I'd have tons of SF/Sacto/LA stories to tell y'all, but I'm exhausted. I'll tell ya later. (Or you can just call tomorrow! It makes it a bit easier for me!)  "I never tire of being useful."
