There can't be anything more boring, disgusting and so tiresome. I'll start from the beginning to fill in the details.  Well, I got there like at 7.45 AM and I saw a couple of my friends. I was supposed to get a name tag, and so I did. I also found So-Young's name tag, and knowing that she wasn't gonna come, I took it with me. The name tag, at the bottom, said, "SENIORS '05 RULE!!!" Ha, yeah right. Lamebutts. Just because you're graduating doesn't mean that you're better than everyone else. Burn!  When it was 8 o'clock we had to move to some shade because some guy was gonna talk to us about marching band and crap. Pfft, as soon as I saw Mr. King, I just looked at him with disgust. Ugh, how much I hate him now. Then they started to teach us the basics of marching, like how to stand and crap. They were making us yell some weird stuff, and one of them was "BAND!" At first I though we were yelling "BAM!", but then I found out it was actually "band." A lot of freshmen though the same way, too. Stupid band directors.  We had to stand in the sun doing marching crap from 8.30 - 11 AM. It was crazy. This man (I forget their names) was telling us what to do and stuff, and so were the squad leaders. We only had water breaks of two minutes, and that it isn't enough when the fuggin' sun is just shining right in front of you freakin' face. Seriously, I felt like fainting. One of the flute girls just collapsed to the floor after thirty minutes. She collapsed twice. I was pretty ok with the sun until around 10.50 AM. But I'll go to that later.  All of those marching stuff that they were teaching us made my back and legs hurt like heck. I couldn't stand it. I wanted to die at that moment. And of course, those stupid water breakes (which supposedly were two minutes, but they were like 30 - 40 seconds long... idiots) didn't help at all because I needed more time to rest. I was standing to the left of Sally-chan, and Michelle-chan was further away from me. There were flute squad leaders helping us and stuff (most of them were seniors), and they were trying to make us yell whatever crap they wanted to make us yell. Seriously, I hate it. I hate this marching band crap. If it were for me, I'd instantly quit and go home and not have to worry about anything of this bullcrap.  I felt as if though I was in the army. I had to stand straight, shoulders up, chest out, hips in, legs together, and I couldn't smile or look around at any time. Any time we were in "tension position" we couldn't move at all. We couldn't scratch, sneeze, move our head a little bit... nothing. And what the heck is up with all these positions? I sure as heck am going to forget them tomorrow. I felt so stupid when I was out in the field, but I think that's how all the freshmen felt. 	 At around 10.15 AM Sally-chan felt dizzy and not very well. She just ran out of the field, but I didn't look to where she was going because I knew I'd get in trouble. Later on Casidy-san told me that she went inside the band hall because she was getting dehydrated or something like that. Veronica-san was inside, too. When 10.30 AM came, every time we had a "water break," I would feel dizzy and not be able to keep my eyes open. I saw everything darker than usual, and my feet felt weak, and so did my arms. But I didn't want to run out of the field because I'd feel very stupid. So when it was 10.50, I felt horrible. I wasn't yelling whatever stuff we were yelling, and I couldn't concentrate. The sun was killing me, and it wasn't because I wasn't drinking enough water...it was because the sun was just striking right at my face. I wasn't the only one feeling this, Casidy-san, Sarah-san [B], and Michelle-chan all felt that way. Thank goodness, because at 11 AM we went inside to the band hall, and we were gonna be there for the rest of the morning practice.  As I had expected, the seniors felt all superior to the freshmen, sophmores and juniors. Of course, what can you expect from people that believe they know it all? As we were going to the band hall, I felt so weak and thought I was just going to collapse...but I didn't. Then this freshman, known as Adrian, was holding the door for everyone, which was leading to the band hall. Some idiotic and moronic senior said, "Hey! Good job holding that door, *chuckle* freshman!" Man! I felt like throwing my instrument at his ugly face, then jump him for believing he was superior to all of the people there. What a retard. When I get to be a senior, I won't act as retarded as that stupid moron. Of course, since I won't be in band any longer, then I won't have to smash on freshmen like that. Blasted fools.  We got these sheets, and in one of them there was a Freshmore song. Most. Retarded. Song. Ever. I never thought there could be such a stupid song in the world. In some part it praises the '05 seniors for being the greatest class and crap like that. Pfft, that's not great, that's LAME! The anti-spiff has them. The squad leaders sang it, and I just felt like laughing at how retarded it was. I hadn't smiled or laughed so far, and now it was not the time. Supposedly we have to memorize it, because some idiots might ask us to sing it. Heck, I'll memorize it, but I won't sing it. It's so retarded, and the '05 seniors suck. Burn again!  The morning rehearsal wasn't supposedly gonna be over until 12 PM, but at 11.30 AM they released us. Sally-chan's sister, Mallory, gave me a ride to my apartment. When I got home I found out that my mom wasn't gonna pick me up at 1.15 PM after all. So I just rested for 30 minutes, ate eggs, then went walking from my house to the Panther Stadium. It wasn't so bad, but the sun was still fuggin' strong. 	 I was one of the first people to get there. In fact, I was the only one there. I got there at 1 PM, but we weren't supposed to come back until 1.30 PM.  Then I walked to the high school's cafeteria, because that's where we were supposed to meet after the lunch break.  Ten minutes after my arrival I found Krasynthia-san walking around. I went with her to the band hall and stuff, then when we came back more flutes had arrived. At 2 PM we started working with Ms. Shults (sp?) with the music and crap. I had to share stands with Michelle-chan and Sarah-san [B]. Those losers! They kept making me laugh and I couldn't concentrate on what Ms. S was saying. We were just laughing throughout most of the afternoon rehearsal. My flute was so fuggin' warm, and I was out of tune so bad...but that was ok, since that's how all of the flutes were. Our pieces of music kept blowing away because we were outside. Michelle-chan kept getting mad every time it was about to blow away, so finally, she said, "Ugh! I'm sick of this crap! Here!" Then she takes out this long stick that she found on the ground and puts it under the music so it won't fly away anymore... Oh...my...fuggin'...goddess... The three of us couldn't stop laughing, and we didn't play once because the laughter wouldn't go away. So I hit Michelle-chan for acting so retarded, and I told her to stop. Of course, she didn't, 'cause Sarah-san and I just kept laughing at the most stupid things.  In marching band everything's different. All the squad leaders have first part, and the other people have second part. No matter how good you were in eighth grade, these squad leaders will make you sound bad. They don't say, "Ok, let's hear the first chair players," or, "Let's hear the first row of flutes." Now it's, "Let's hear freshmen now," or, "Now let me hear the sophmores," and stuff like that.  At 3.30 PM we stopped practicing and went inside the band hall to talk about more band crap. Ugh, I DON'T CARE! After more talking and talking, our practice for the day was over. Holy, was I tired or what? I couldn't walk and my feet were aching so bad. They gave us a lot of marching band information sheets, but I didn't bother to look at them. Y'know, I'd quit this instant, but I wanna get my P.E. and art credits before I do. So after this horrible and painful year, I'll be band-less, flute-less, and band director-less. It'll be my happiest day ever. I'm telling you, freshman year is gonna suck so bad...  So I told my mom about everything that happened. She told me to quit. I was glad to hear that, but I didn't tell her anything. When I got home, I ate, then fell asleep for two hours. When I woke up my legs were still hurting. My parents are out right now 'cause they're gonna buy me some vitamins to help me not feel dizzy when I'm out there. I hope that helps... 	 Tomorrow's Crazy Sock Day...or so the band directors want you to believe. First of all, what the fug? This Crazy Sock Day bull is mandatory, but I sure as heck don't have any crazy socks. All I'm gonna wear is some socks that don't match, and if they're not happy with that, then tough. I'm not gonna do all the stupid things that they tell me to do...and why does this have to be mandatory, anyway? What are they gonna do, check everyone's socks? This is just bullcrap. And I'm gonna have to do this band camp for 8 days. I HATE MARCHING BAND. BAND!
