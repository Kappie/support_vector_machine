All I have to do it keep the post kind of short. Like the first one was bigger then I thought it would be. I dunno, I'll try to post this and see what happens. If this doesn't work I'll give up for the night and leave in disgust. Yep so I guess this is my voice on the net now. Pretty shitty voice if you ask me. I'm like one person out of a million or more who have a blog probably. So if more then Jamie reads this, I'd be surprised. So to get right down to it, I'm going to give a quick overview of myself. I'm an attention whore, plain and simple. I have a thing against almost all people but need to be in the spotlight most of the time. I hate clowns and cold weather. Odd numbers piss me off, as well as stupidity. I have a fear of drowning or getting pulled underwater by something, but I love swimming. That's good enough I guess, nothing left really. Oh, and I like the color pink.
