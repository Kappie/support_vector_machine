Then I got hold of Marie and her and Brandon were hangin out at Shantel's and said to come on over then we'd find Carlye. So I went and we roamed around lookin for Carlye for like..an hour then I said she's prolly gettin high with who other than Darren, but no we looked there after like 5 other places and when we got there of course she came out all happy and with food lol. So we walked around tryin to find people who could buy us..stuff lol. Once we got it we went back to Shantel's we started the party and we were lookin through the 6th grade yearbook and I started signing it lol and then we saw Samantha's picture and started talking about her..and then she called. Very trippy, and I talked to her for awhile and then we went out and about. Then we walked over to Jetty Surf Cafe and saw some people and it was Kristen Burke with some other people and we talked for like ever. Then ASshley F. came up and said McKenna left for a party without her lol so she dragged Carlye around looking for someone who could take her. We found out it was past 10 so we tried to get back to Shantel's without the cops finding us which we didn't thank god. Marie passed out right away and I layed down. Then someone knocked on the door and it was Axel, Kenny, Carlye and Ashley and they all came up and so there were 7 of us on a double bed lol. Axel was tryin to get all close to Ashley and Kenny was like all over Shantel and I was right next to thems o that wasn't cool. Shantel finally told them to leabve at like 12 or 1 couldnt see the clock lol and Kenny of course was like, "hey wanna come over to my house" and kept like raping her but she said no and what was really weird was that carlye said yes. Kenny tried tellin us that he wasn't the type of guy to "hit it and quit it" and I got pissed and told him bullshit you just went from Carlye to Shantel right when she was in the fucking room. and Shantel's jaw dropped and Ashley and Axel started laughin lol. So they left and then it was just me, Marie(still passed out) and Shantel layin down. I woke up early and left then later on went to Clint's and watched a movie..kinda lol. And today..well just kinda chilled and did nothing and I just remembered I have to read a book and take notes so I'm gonna go...FUCK MONDAYS!
