And the second time they went out was for only about 5 minutes because then Seth left with his dad.  So it's not my fault you didn't blow stuff up.  I just kind of guilted you a bit so that you would make the decision I wanted you to make... that's not too bad, is it?  Besides, there's always next year.  Or even this year I suppose- they're still selling fireworkss and stuff over on Granny White or somewhere like that.  I'm glad you got home ok, Josh.  You left and I went into the living room and my mom was like, "yeah, there's a whole big line of storms heading this way.  I hope Josh gets home all right."  Yeah, thanks mom, big comfort there.  But you did get home, and everything is good, so I'm shutting up for now and going to post of your blog because the last post was almost a week ago and it's getting lonely.
