Well Rachel definetly thought so, she's sitting right beside me repeating "blogger fever"  over and over and over...goo.  Well anyways it's Monday and I've spent the day with Rachel.  Not much has happened since I wrote last...we went to the movies Friday and saw AVP which was definetly good...predator won of course.  (and the sexy black chick) ok just kidding.  That night I heard some things about Tyler too and it made me mad so we went to Calebs for about 2 minutes and he was there and I just completely ignored him.  Then, the next morning I left to Belleville for the whole weekend to shop and my mom spent about 600$ on me which I definetly thought was good.  Then I came back and well...got chewed out by Tyler because apparently he was worried or something and the stuff I heard was false.  Oh well, nothing can be done about it now.  Then today as I said before was spent with Rachel, we got the cops called on us!  Haha, such rebellion, but it was for a stupid reason...just because we turned around in some people's driveway...apparently they didn't like it.  They'll get over it for sure.  But before that we roamed around in Casey desperately seeking something to do but it was to no avail.  So we came back to Greenup and picked up the ferret and chilled like polar bears, driving around town and such.  Then came home and ate doughnuts and pizza.  It was good times.  Now we've decided that we're going to make scrapbooks of just ourselves throughout this year.  That should be cool.  But for now I think I'm going to go, possibly chat some more, possibly go to bed because Rachel is gettin seepy...awww...haha.  Ok, then tomorrow we're going to get up early I guess and venture to Casey.  We'll see how that works out.  Until then, may your dreams and thought be filled with...me!!
