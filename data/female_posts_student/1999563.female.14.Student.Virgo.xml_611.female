But now I will get to rest for a couple days. Today I have to go to church but I might just sleep instead because, lke I said earlier, I am quite sick.  Today I woke up at 12. Then I unpakced my suitcases. I hate unpacking! It takes so long. I love to pack because I am always excited to be going somewhere but when I get home i am always really tired and in a bad mood. :)  Blehh. I feel like...I dunno..just sick.  Tomorrow my dad and my brothers are going to go on a 50 mile hike around Mt. Rainier. It should take a week. Then, on Monday morning, my sister is going to camp! So it will just be me and my mom alllll week! We are going to go to Cannon Beach for a couple days and probably [hopefully] go to the Couv Mall and get new shoes. How exciting!!  Then MANDY COMES!  I am so excited!!!!!!!  Mwa hahahahhaahahhahahaa!  We are gonna go crazy. woohoo!
