LOL    Mind Games    Does he still like her? Why do i ask this? Trust i always had  now resides as fear I say it's alright your just her friend. but a picture dances in my head of a kiss from more then friends Then all of a sudden  you snap in my head "I love you babe she she is just a friend" I want to trust you I really do It just seems so hard My wondering mind makes pictures pictures of dsiloyalty  Why am I playing this game A horrible game with myself. I can make it stop for now untill the next night for when i lay down it all comes back again!!  By:    Kari        Locke
