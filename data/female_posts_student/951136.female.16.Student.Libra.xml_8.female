I didn't even get to talk to alanah like i had wanted. but it was still great fun. Everyone and their brother showed up there last night too. Shareef wrote boobie on the window we were at from outside...like i said! I STILL DONT GET IT! guys are one stranger breed of something else.  Was he noticing we had them? No, that alanah had them! hahah, you do not lack up there alanah. you are well endowed both up and down, i assure you.  forget  what lucas said. Tho me on the other hand. psh, idk where i compensate for up there. give me some of yours! HAHA! anyway! back to the reality world, away from all our " momentary insanity" laughs band exhausted me this week! i was dead by friday! You ppl just dont understand how much it can take out of you. i slept til 12 today. i HATE doing that! it sucks ass! wastes my day! but i was in serious sleep deprication. All day sunday doing homework...this is how pathetic my life is...nothing...i sound so boring. i dont remember the last thing that made me laugh. Lack of passions. seriously. and Mrs DEMEL IS GOING TO KILL ME! theres the beginning of a root of my destruction!!!! bloody hell! the woman has gone mad! gave us  one of her quizzes 'that we will fail anyway' to study for. maps to finish. vacab to chart out. chapter notes to take. WTF. ga. and other things are bothering me. I love jennifer to death. and i feel helpless when she tells me everything she's going through b.c. i want to help SO bad. i hate seeing her in a position i was in. It sucks! nd depressed me! I LOVE YOU GIRL! tell me how i can help! even tho its not my battle to fight it still is bringing me down. and school and band together are whipping me good. life itself has lost passion and purpose again. I wake up to get to the next day in hopes of plans to go to starbucks w. alanah. hahaha thats the ONLY thing! damn thats sad...alright then...well
