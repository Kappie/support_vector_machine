It is my hope that this is not only a place where we can laugh and have fun being our random selves, but a sort of online support group.  Think of it this way, we are all sitting around a camp-fire, basking in the soft glow of the great peace of trust, and friendship, and all the things that warm our souls.  We're all singing songs of our trials and experiences, our lives and eachother.  We're laughing and joking and we are  together!   It hasn't hit me yet that Erika and Morganna are leaving.  Not to the full extent anyway.  It will most likely be a tough fall for me.  If the transformation from high school to college changes people as much as it has been said to then it's going to be a whirlpool around here.  How many more times can I watch Erika act like a cat, or the posessed girl from the Ring, all the while laughing until I choke.  How much longer will I be able to give Morganna crap about her laugh?  It's going to be very different.  I apologize for that tangent but writing this is helping me more than anything.  I guess I just wanted to encourage the crew to be  real .  It's something I don't think I've been lately.  Hope to see everyone at youth group tonight or sometime later in our crazy, random and beautiful lives.  no regrets, seth
