(During a game of Ultimate Frisbee... our team was for some reason named "Team Fury." We weren't that great and this was right after Josh scored for us) Mark: Yay team awesome. Sarah: Team Fury. Austin C.: Team "we suck but Josh doesn't." Garrett: We're the "Wannabe Joshes."  (Mark sits down at dinner with a blue drink) Heather: Are you blue? Mark: Are you corny? (to Nick) Hey Nick, are you red? (pause) 'Cause... your drink's red...   "And now starts another year without a date..."  -Mark Seifert while Z-Man was shaving his head so he had a mullet  Austin M.: Have you gotten any compliments on your mullet yet? Mark: One - but he had a mustache drawn on his face so I'm not sure I believe him or not.  "Hey, you have a mullet, don't make fun of me."  -Sean Switzer when he was holding up a full water bottle to his face and looking at people through it and Mark thought it was dumb  "I hate cauliflower, I think it's gross. I think it's like albino broccoli." -Hillary  "What? You can't STOP. My head's not gonna feel itself." -Mark when everyone who was petting his mullet stopped  (Mark says something that everyone gets quiet for) Kris: Shh... the mullet speaks. Mark: (twirls his hair up on the sides) It's smiling at you. It says, that's a good one Kris!  "You better not get up in his face - he's likely to, you know, defend his trailer." -Becky when someone was teasing Mark about his hair, again  It was quite a mullety weekend.
