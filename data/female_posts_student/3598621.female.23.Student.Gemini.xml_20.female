I think it would be a good idea to get into it and start learning some of these skills. If you take the idea of multiple intelligence (Gardner, 1983)*, I'm mainly trained in logical-mathematical. My other levels of intelligence are above average in China. But the change of language and culture means I need to develop a different model of linguistic talent (in English) and interpersonal talent (interactions with Americans). These two types of intelligence are highly contextualized and thus, difficult to transfer. In terms of emotional intelligence, I think it mainly includes linguistic, intrapersonal and interpersonal. My self-regulatory ability could use some improvement. That's why I started this blog. It has been particularly difficult for me to regulate my behavior during emotional difficulty times. However, it is during these times that people with great personality show their strengths, manners, and grace.   It is difficult to fully control my emotions when I need to go through a major change in life like breaking up with Wei. It impacts quite a few plans that I have for the future -- my social life, my family life, my career, etc. I should acknowledge that during a time of change, even a change for the better, the initial period is always difficult, and I will definitely feel down. But I've known for a long time that this is a wise decision that could benefit both of us in the long term. I have a tendency of thinking too much about it and letting my emotions get in the way of everything. The lack of control and determination shows weakness in my personality. A better way to handle this type of situation is to distract myself from it by hammering away on the work that I need to do. Once the emotions calm down, I would be in a better position to make wise arrangements.  linguistic, musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, body-kinesthetic, intrapersonal (e.g., insight, metacognition) and interpersonal (e.g., social skills).
