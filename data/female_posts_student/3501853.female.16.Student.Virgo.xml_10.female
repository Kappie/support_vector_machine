I thought sitting at home would help me forget but I just sit at bed crying and screaming, I can't go on living, at least not like this. I mean ya I've changed and I'm not running away from my problems but I'm just standing still watching things not get better, it's not any better than running away. I IM'd her today but I'm not sure if she got it or not. I was like shaking typing it. Anyways, when my mom got home, we went car shopping. We went to a Hyundai dealer and they had bogus cars so we ended up at a Toyota dealer. After a while of looking, we got really really interested in the Toyota Scion XA. It's new just a month old so all they had was stick but we got to test drive one automatic. I like it a lot, so does my mom. She was giggly and hyper about it. She's actually pretty when she doesn't have her bitchy look on. Here's a picture of the car: http://www.scion.com/drive/gallery/drive_xa_gallery.html Anyways, the people still have to make her car so we can't get it til 2-4 weeks from now. But when she gets it, I get the Rav4! She's giving it to me. I'm really thankful. All she's doing is making me pay 500 dollars which isn't bad since she's paying for the new scion and the rav4 still so it's close to a 1000 a month for her and all I have to pay for is gas. Tonight, I found a new found love and respect for my mommy. We were driving home from the dealership and we weren't talking because she was on the phone with Tim. When she got off, she looked at me and she saw a tear run down my eye and I was like "Mom, I think I'm going to cry right now. I can't help it so please don't yell" and instead of her normal bitter loud answer to my cries, this time, she was genuinely concerened and was asking "why sweetheart?" and she said it gently. I think she knew it was different that time cuz I don't usually cry in front of her unless it's from her or for some stupid reason and usually I don't cry just out of nowhere. So then I told her some stuff, actually I told her a lot of stuff in little sentences. I told her that I miss my best friends and I miss having the one person who really understood me. I told her that I have Ana and Kev but I've been so sad lately because I'm too stubborn to express how I feel but I miss her so much I just need her back I need her to know that I really am sorry and would take it all back. She just took my head and she said aw sweetheart i love you and pulled my head closer to her and let me cry in her lap. She told me some wise advice that seems so simple but just hearing it from her, i dunno. I love her so much. We've gotten so close this past month. She is so much wiser than I ever gave her credit for. Okay I'm ready to stop thinking...
