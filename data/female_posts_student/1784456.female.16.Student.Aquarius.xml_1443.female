Ralph McTell - Streets of London. Thus proving that teachers are trying to brain wash us into liking certain things! *it gets weirder* I had a dream that my earing had ripped out but my ear was alright and I couldn't get it back in! What a freak dream. Oh yeah... AHHH must change the music!  From the Guardian (12 Nov 94), re: Paul Ridout, one of the British backpackers kidnapped in India by Kashmiri separatists, and recently freed: The first thing he had done after arriving home was to eat some Marmite on toast. "It was pretty good. It's just one of those things—you get out of the country and it's all you can think about."  Yeah... hmmm... I don't think that I would be thinking about marmite if I was kidnapped!  urlLink http://www.gty.org/~phil/marmite.htm#wherebuy  And don't ask how I got onto a site about Marmite!
