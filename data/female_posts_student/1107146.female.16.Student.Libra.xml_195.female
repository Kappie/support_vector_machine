Not limited to God, or "gods" for that matter, just that we are the stuff of dreams, much like the things we see during sleep.   It also coincides with the argument, "How do I know that you're real? I know I'm real, but I don't know if you are or not,"...speaking from one putting drastic emphasis on the falsity of the physical facade, of course. What the hell am I saying? Heh.  I just got done with my lil' review sheet for 5th, so I'm in contemplative mode, and it was a topic that I've thought about before. Whether or not you intended it to be that way is the question...and I'm guessing not :)  An hour and fifteen minutes to go...
