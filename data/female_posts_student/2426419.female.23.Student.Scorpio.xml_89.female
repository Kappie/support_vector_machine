       
      i'll be right back (tomorrow) to discuss great issues i'm dealing with, in life and/or in mind, such as retirement (like all of us doing it now), sleeping requirements, tales from the grocery store, and possibly the stranges dreams we've ever had (careful).  your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to save the young blog.  i am a blogger on a mission.
