Well we hung out on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. He's been calling me and we've been talking. Well I considered him a friend. Turns out he doesn't think the same way. He sat there and told my friend Syd that he thinks I stalk him and that if he called me and was like I wanna have sex, I'd do him. That's not even the case. I just started talking to him recently.. And plus I like his really good friend, Joe. So now I can't understand why he would sit there and hang out with me if he doesn't like me.. Why would he put in a good word about me to Joe. Why would he have hung out with me Monday and rush me home so I wouldn't be late. If he doesn't like me..  Why not show his true colors?     But other than that things are good. I think. Me and Brandon have been haveing good coverstations. His ex girl friend from like 2 years ago called him the other day and sat there and went over his house. I know what she's trying to do. She's trying to hurt him more then she already did when they were engaged. But now she is engaged to some boy and lives with him. Brandon is so hurt by her. I wish I could do something but I can't. I try to tell him not to think about her but something happens and he does. She's supposed to be at his show on Monday. Me and Syd are going. I swear if I see Amanda (Brandon's ex ) I'm gonna beat her face in.. Me and Syd.    My Squirt went and got neuterd today. I am so worried for him. He was all excited about going to the vet. But he'll be happy to get out of there.     I am thinkin I am going to get into my old jeans again. Like go back to who I used to be. And ditch all these people that are not good for me. That a rude.. But it's hard because of who I am. And my identity. I'm really starting to like that song by Kyeon West Jesus walks with me. I really like that song..
