Man it felt so good doing it, it was as if i was like getting rid of that part of my life, and going outwith a bang lol Rara came home sat. and i felt like the biggest tard. We were going to the airport to meet her there, and we missed her! she walked right passed us and we didnt even see her...only something that stupid would happen to me lol Im so glad shes back, its been nothing but laughs since shes been back. :) ive come to this part in my life where i need to focus on me. Im tired of worrying about others feelings and hurting myself in the process. ive been speaking my mind more often and i know im pissing people off while im doing it but at this point, it doesnt matter to me n e more. Im not even sorry if i hurt someones feelings along the way, bc for so long i was hurting myself bc those idiots where assholes and were bringing me down. well im gonna go and be lazy bc im sick with a god damn chest cold! :(
