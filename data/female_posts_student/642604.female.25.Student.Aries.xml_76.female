No wonder they played 'And The Band Played On' like a million times yesterday. I watched it once... I had forgotten. If you ever want to see me cry myself into ridiculous dry heaves put on that or the Laramie Project. Both movies break my heart and you have never seen me break down like I do when I think of all the bullshit that goes on that I just don't understand. I want to know for christ's sake how people can be so goddamn ignorant and cruel and I just don't understand how people can turn away from other people just because of who or what they are. Human Rights geared toward Gay and Lesbian rights, as many of you know, is my thing. Everyone has a thing that they are passionate about. My old roommate's was Feminism, my best friend's is Racism and mine is Human Rights. I have never understood how just because someone is gay they are looked upon differently, if they had done something to you personally, assaulted you or what not, fine.... but to just hate someone because of what gender they choose to be with? Bullshit! I have many gay friends and they are no different from any of my straight friends... I don't understand why people see it as being different at all. It pisses me off to no END! Okay now I am seriously working myself up into a frenzy. OH! And I was told the other day, since I can't give blood I wasn't aware of this, if you have had sex with a same-sex partner you CANNOT give blood. Okay, maybe back in the 80s when we were just learning about AIDS and what not, I could forgive this, but not now! Not today! Not when just as many straight people in the world have AIDS or are HIV positive as the gay population. So basically that means that if I could give blood and hadn't had an AIDS test in a long while and probably know less about the quality of my blood cells that just because I am straight I could give blood over my friends who have quality blood, who have been tested recently, who are in MUCH BETTER HEALTH than I because they are gay. BULLSHIT! Glad the Red Cross or whatever who just a few months back and still might be starving for blood are so anxious to turn things around. COME ON PEOPLE! Unreal. Whatever, I am done ranting now... I need a cigarette to calm myself down.... [ Mon Dec 02, 04:12:01 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Sometimes I think it seems as if I only call on my friends when I am moving... and maybe I do... but it's just because I SEEM TO BE MOVING ALL THE GODDAMN TIME!!!!!!!! Hey, but on the upside, I just found out that everyone gets a pay raise for the new year and the lowest percentage you can get and this is if you suck HUGE is 10%! NO ONE GIVES THAT MUCH AS THE LOWEST!!! AND my Christmas bonus... that's right folks, you heard me right... standard christmas bonus... is going to be at least a week's pay... I LOVE MY JOB!!! Plus I got to terminate two people today... well at least I was involved... making the world a much better place for borrowers :) I am like Superman... or woman or whatever... I'M JUST COOL! NEVER FEAR, ERIN IS HERE! Okay so now I am acting retarded but it is merely off of the high of MORE MONEY FOR ME!!! And my boss and owner is so cool, I love him. I love my job! Okay, done now... perhaps I will post one of my more cynical statements later.
