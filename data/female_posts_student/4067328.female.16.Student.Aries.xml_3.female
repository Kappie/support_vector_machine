"turn" *hand motions left* "go" *hands motion front*... i thought it was successful until she missed a turn.. oh well. i tried.      we did safely get to ericas and from there went to go pick up her friend meg.. who is very cool and also a maroon 5 groupie (ha such a great word) like jess and i. the ride down was filled with lots of chatting and giggling. i mean what did you expect with 4 girls in a car going to a concert honestly? we realize as we get down there that i could be a prob if the ferrys aren't running cause of the hurricane cause erica has no idea how to get over the bridge. so just in case we get lost and need assistance jess and i proceed to put the cd jackets from the john m and m 5 cds in the windows so everyone knows where we're going and can help us get there! BRILLIANT! and to add a touch she writes "john mayer and maroon 5!" in blue pen on the back of a target receipt and puts it to the window... way to be ghetto.      fortunately the ferrys were fine and we got an early ferry across. made jokes at stupid things like the 'diet food kitchen' and '24 ADULT (not children people... adult) life preserver' signs, the RIDE THE DUCK boat that appeared to be sinking, and all the guys using the bathroom on a 5 min ferry ride. the one who went in as we were docking was even better.      so we made our way down to the gates of the tweeter center only to realize we had to wait an hour.. outside.. in the rain.. wonderful! it was made somewhat interesting by the underage drunk girl next to us who was laying on the pavement with her boobs popping out and all the guys stretching their necks to get a look. then there was the lovely butt crack episode.. i'll leave that up to your imaginations.      we made it in.. got some food (frikin $8 for a hot dog and bottle of water)... got our teeshirts (i'm going to live in mine).. made some quick bathroom runs and went to our seats, which were awesome.. center, 1st row of the second section, and surrounded by lots of hot guys ;). then a bunch of older (not to offend the rents) drunk couples sat behind us and said something about their kids and how they don't get out much in one big runon sentence. they were fun though.. and it was entertaining to watch them dance. hah      THEN it was time... the show was about to begin!! maroon 5 took the stage and omgg let me tell you.. they are amazing. the lead singer is just... *drool*. we screamed like lil girls at a backstreet boys concert (which i was at one point in my childhood so don't make fun!!). anyways they started with though with you which i def wasn't expecting but made me very happy cause it's a great song. after that all the songs kinda just ran together in one big blur.. and me screaming out every single word. but she will be loved was just *sigh* amazing.      the funniest part of the show was the 4 or 5 guys three rows behind us. they sat there (no lie) half asleep the entire time maroon 5 was on. they had to be so stoned and looked miserable. the four of us would whisper to each other, look (very discreetly) behind us, and then burst out into fits of laughter. like they didnt know we were talking about them. oh and then there was the gay kid and his girlfriend in front of us sucking face the whole time. jess cupped her mouth and said in her booming voice.."this is a concert, not a HOTEL ROOM"... that made them leave haha gotta love jess and her openness.      then they went off and people began setting up for john. well me and erica decide its time to go make a quick bathroom break. yea right.. so did everyone else. needless to say there was a huge line and as we're walking back to the seats we hear all this screaming and then OMG john starts singing! well me and erica take off running down the sidewalk in the dark going "WHERES THE SECTION? WHERES THE SEAT? OMG I'M GONNA FALL"... quite comical. we made it in record time to our seats though and could enjoy the rest of no such thing.       john did a good job. but personally i like maroon 5 better. while he sang all my favs, there are lots of other great songs on his heavier things cd that he didn't play.. i really was looking forward to hearing split screen sadness or wheel. but i am def not complaining. the whole let-me-and-this-other-guy-play-each-others-guitars-without-looking-thing was crazy cool. and let me tell you.. that guy makes some interesting faces when he sings...      and then to all of our disappointments.. it was over. *tear*. and we made our way back to dtown    in conclusion.. concert was aflsjndiLSFI#()P#*% nidsn... ahh the adventures of concert-going      yup that about sums it up      til next time-   jaimie
