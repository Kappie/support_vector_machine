Both of these instances are my fault. I probably set my wallet somewhere and forgot it, and I left the stroller outside last night without realizing it.  I've spent the last 2 hrs retracing my steps in the heat of summer, trying to find the wallet... I don't even care if the money's gone!  ARGH!!!!  On a good note; I talked to one of my closest friends, Lance, the other day. I was feeling UBER bummed today until I got a letter from him! He and Matt are still together and doing great.   I miss them like crazy, but I may be visiting soon. Mom said she would even babysit Sky one weekend, so I can have some fun. It  is  tempting, but I am not sure if I could survive it! ! ! !
