It's due on the 6th (next friday!) and it's a big project so I'm trying to finish it earlier so that I don't have to procrastinate.   I swear it has sucked the life out of me with it's dullness.  About 5 minutes ago, I was on msn and then Michele went on.  I said hi to start a conversation.  Shortly after, Michele got bored of talking to me and left or blocked me. I'm pretty sure she just left.  Mah.   I then left also because I really should be doing this evil project.    I'm not sure If Michele still wants to be friends with me.  I was talking to her and then she got bored of me.  Do friends get bored of eachother?  Maybe.  I'm not really sure because it never really occurred.  I don't really know what's happenening.  Perharps it's time for a break from Social studies and Social life.                                                         -Julie *To be Continued later on in another post*
