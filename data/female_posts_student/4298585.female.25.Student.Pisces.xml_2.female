This coming Tuesday I will be attending  urlLink Northern Virginia Community College  to become a respiratory therapist. Not sure what that is check this out  urlLink click here  or  urlLink click here . The only local community college with a theme song on the radio. . . It makes me so proud!  So between full time work and 2 partime jobs not to mention family, boyfriend, and friends, my life will be uber crazy, but hopefully in five semesters (two fall, two spring and the summer in between) I will be graduated and working as a respiratory therapist in New Mexico, or Hawaii, or somewhere different and fun like that.
