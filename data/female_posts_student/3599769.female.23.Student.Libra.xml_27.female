I hate that everyone I know is working and actually doing work. I feel like sleeping.   Only an hour and a half to go. I wish I had a book to read. I just bit off all my nails, and they feel gross now. Not very attractive. Next comes the lip-biting. And then the inside cheek-biting.  I'm gonna be 24 in two months! I feel like a loser. I really thought by this time things would be different for me. I'm just themarrying kind of girl. I believe in  love  and it seems to be one of my  biggest downfalls. Why is that the word " love " and" hell " conjure up the same color? Isn't that weird, someone at least got that straight.   I believe in alot of stupid things. Good for nuthin' kind of things.
