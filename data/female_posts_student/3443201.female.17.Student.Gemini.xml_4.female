My mom was okay and anytime she can leave.  We just have to pay the bills.  She got this PHILHEALTH stuff and there were requirements to avail its benefits.  I was the one who made the follow up.  Asked the person in charge. Went to the PHILHEALTH office.  Asked inquiries and the rest.  I was so tired and after all, the PHILHEAlTH representative said we can't avail its benefits.  My mom made an advance payment assuming that my sister had pay the other months.  It's needless to say all their policies which were only good for the government anomalies! It was so frustrating.  So my mom was there in the hospital.  Now, the question: how much we owe? at least 22,000.  Pressuming and assuming that we can avail their services offered we have enough money to pay the excess. It really bugs me!    Another event.  We were in the room when we heard a cry.  It's scary.  I think someone died.  My God guide that person and his/her family.
