I'll only be able to practice on tuesdays and fridays (how ghetto is that, practice on fridays from 5:15 to 7:15, that just screws up any plans we have or plan to make).  My mind is constantly wavering about the topic.  One day I'm like, "I don't think I'm going to play, it will make my life so much less complicated if I don't play." And then when I went to practice over the break I was like, "Oh, I remeber this and how much fun I had,  I want to make this work."  Ah, I don't know.  Help me.  To play or not to play?  Please help me, I'm so confused (maybe).
