Krystal's leaving for Durham first and earliest as an R.A...Jess and Julie go to Queen's, Cassandra goes to Guelph, Mel goes to Loyalist, Britta is going to Algonquin and i am going the farthest all the way out to St FX in Nova Scotia (yay, i make up the second province).   First and foremost, packing.  Who knew that anyone actually needs as much as they do?  I mean i went school supplies shopping and god!  you have to get the stapler and scissors you always steal from the kitchen when working on a project, you have to buy a stupid three whole puncher because you know that you'll be completely screwed without it.   Also, you begin to stock up on candy (well, me)...because you never know if you'll be able to get it...little town.  I mean seriously!  My candy stash now has poprocks (currently popping), fun dips, dubble bubble, endless amounts of gummy worms, gobstoppers, i'm going to get fat i swear.  People should be warned, i mean.   Clothes: what is appropriate now?  Why do you feel the need to actually go out and buy new comfy clothes when you know you're going to invest into like five more sweater/pant sets with your new school logo on it.   Technology: computer, tv, dvd player, phone...it's crazy!!!  First year is spent on stuff you use at home, but can't take with you...it hurts to think about.   But guys, seriously.  I'm getting nervous...i will forget stuff, i will need stuff...it'll be an endless disappointing circle in the coming few weeks.  I am also getting nervous to go.  It acutally is quite far, and it is a little intimidating in case i do happen to forget stuff.  I'm more scared to lose all you guys though, that's why we have to keep in touch.  We have to make new friends, as scary as it might sound.  Just when our circle is tight and close, we have to go form a new one.  Anyways, there's goes my intro to university packing...who knew it would be so lengthy!  lol.  Les.
