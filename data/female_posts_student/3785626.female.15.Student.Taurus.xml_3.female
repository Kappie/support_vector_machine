Dad came back at around 4:30, Chris took me to Starkville. Shoe Dept. didn't have my Chuck's so I'm probably going to buy them off the internet. Should have checked at Hibbet's though. Then we went to JC Penney, I bought 2 shirts and 1 for my mommy. Then we went to Wally World. Got me a SpongeBob Rocker notebook and some Sharpies and some Candy. Wheeee...Then we went to China Garden and got food. This was my first time ever to eat with chopsticks. And I'm Asian!!! Oh well, it was fun...Tomorrow is the Fireworks Over The Water at Choctaw Lake. I'm going and gonna have fun I guess. Lol. Spuddy came over for a few to chill, he told me what Javors and Mary told him to do...>Try to go with me instead of Amber, because of what happened between him and Tregory. He said he wasn't gonna do it, because that is disrespectful and all. He thought I was going to be mad, I would only be mad if he would have tried to do it. Plus, I'm helping him and Amber "talk"...So yeeah, he wouldn't wanna upset me. Lol. Anyways Tregory left his pullover at my house, so now I'm wearing it. Teeheehee...*sniff sniff* :D  Well layder people. Hyper! Hyper! (Off Skittles n Gummi Bears) 3 Cherry 3's Tregory 3
