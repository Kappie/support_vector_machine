Terry, Bill and Steve (the morning hosts) are hilarious and they always talk about interesting things (mainly, sex-related topics). Yesterday, they were talking about which cartoon character or super hero would you sleep with and tons of people called in. It was great! There were some funny answers. I just checked out the k-rock site and there's a link to cartoon porn. Click  urlLink  here   for a laugh (warning: "adult" site). It feels ironic to say that it's an adult site, although it features girls of Disney movies. I guess if I had to pick one, it would have to be either Neo from The Matrix (we all know how crazy I am about Keanu Reeves!) or Superman because then we could do it in mid-air. As for a cartoon character, I would have to say Eric from "The Little Mermaid". I HAD a crush on him WHEN (not since!) I was a little girl!  Also, maybe Tarzan...ok, I think I'm putting too much thought into this. Anyways, who would you pick and why?
