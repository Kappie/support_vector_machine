ABBY, I'm going to post it tomorrow. And thanks for the hand, in a manner of speaking. I just recorded a new song and I was gripping the hand in frustration because I couldn't get those damn vocals right again and again. Don't worry, I didn't break it, if it even bent out of place a bit I frantically put it to a side and beat the holy hell out of my head with the hardest and closest object possible for even thinking of defying the holy relic. Once again, I am done. Maybe I should start talking to my psychiatrist about my limb fetish? Wait...what psychiatrist?  LINDSEY,  I want to see your hair dude, that's amazing. Thanks for the song!  ROSIE, thanks for the birthday wishes both on the phone and here, despite your one-track mind about me not telling you something. God, I don't know what you want me to say. I'm pregnant? There you go. I'm pregnant. "Hello fetus, when you're ready, come out and meetus." Heh, I heard that on TV today from some guy talking to his baby in his wife's stomach. It was really funny at the time. And you won't find it, so NAH. Jeez, jez hold on to yer britches for another week or so and I'll pull the fish out of the water, 'k?  WILL, thanks for the HBD on  Antiphilanthrophy , very surprised to see anyone on there. Hope your summer is going great.  That's it for now people. I said I was going to have a party tomorrow but I lied. Too much organization that I haven't done yet. But I'll try to put it together again sometime later...maybe when everyone could be there, that would be nice. Jeez, you hit "lazy season" and everyone is parting to the four corners of the earth. What happened to the "lazy" in summer vacation? Hey, I don't do anything, and from my perspective,  YOU  shouldn't be doing anything either.  One more thing...I was thinking...I can take my songs and put them in WMA format and send them through the 'net, so there's no more hassle of CDs...but that would take space and time to get into your inboxes, and in the case of Rosie and Will, with the dialups and such, practically impossible. I just thought I would put that on the table and see what everyone thought of it.  G'bye friends.
