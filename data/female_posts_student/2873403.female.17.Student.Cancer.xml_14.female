There's nothing to do... blah blah... Adam is weird. He's my morning buddy. Me and Chris are going to sing in English today. He brought his guitar to school so we're gonna jam (and before practice too). I'm hungry. Well, the bell is going to ring soon, so I'm gonna go and find my awesome boyfriend. :) Goodbye!
