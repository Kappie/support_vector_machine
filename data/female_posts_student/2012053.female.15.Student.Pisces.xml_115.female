Thanks for you lovely comments!!!            and also mandy, thank you for your comments in my post about Senator Kerry, I liked them!            anyway, today was very interesting, I went to get my yearbook which for $40 was SO lame, I mean it was like ALL seniors and then freshman class "best" junk was like 6 people, what's up with that? geez, then I went to drivers ed....            oh. my. gosh. my teacher (mr. wakefield) is like the biggest psychotic person I HAVE EVER MET. ok the class is 2 hours long, and he took 90 minutes talking about              capturing our good thoughts      throwing out "dangerous" thoughts      how some of us have parents who:      hate us      are divorced      or abuse us      or who just don't understand      then he talked about his personal life which was:      his divorce      his wife cheating on him      how it's not the same with his wife anymore        (keep in mind this is  DRIVERS ED  )         how he has 6 kids, one of whom just graduated from college, one who is a pharmacist, and one who works for him      how he took anti-depressants and then flushed then down the toilet because they made him feel "numb"      how psychiatrists quote "suck"       how much he loves God, which is fine, but were in  DRIVERS ED        how if we don't know what we want to be when we grow up RIGHT NOW we are "thinking dangerous thoughts and wasting our time and lives"       then after all that we watched a 10 minute video, went over the book approximately 5 minutes, and took a STINKING TEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      so, he didn't tell you where ANY of the information was, since it was open book so I got a STUPID 85%      I was so mad.      so I told my parents and they transferred me out of psychopaths class to a lady named Chelsea who Kody says is really cool.      yeah.      then after that we went and dropped our van off at the Toyota place since it was acting funny and went to the stupid mall.      where I got the coolest book!!! it's by this guy who used to work for CBS and it's about how the media is liberally biased, and how people don't realize it and like a million more enlightening things!!!      I am so excited about it! I tell you how it goes!      then I got like 3 cans of tennis balls and this super neat vibration dampener, which ROCKS!!      oh! and christa was a the mall!!! it was quite the excitement!! and she has a friendnamed Taylor!!! that's MY name!!!      so Ciao!!
