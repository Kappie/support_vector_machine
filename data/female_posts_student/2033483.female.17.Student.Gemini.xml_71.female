I woke up, showered, started my lit and comp paper, finished history, and chemistry and studied a bit for Algebra and physics.  I have a 'C' in Chemistry and I blame Florida because I desperately want to blame someone other than myself.  In all my other classes I seemed to bounce back fairly well, but for some reason I just can't seem to get it in Chem.  I know their will be some people reading this going, "A 'C' is still really good."  But I've never gotten a 'C' in high school before and I don't want to start my last semester of my junior year.  I've worked too hard to just punk out now.  But then again what does it matter?  I mean 10 years from now is it really going to make a difference if I got a 'B' in high school chemistry or a 'C'?  Hell no.  But it matters to me now, so I really have to do well on this final.  That was two contradicting sentences so you don't need to point it out to me.  It's Sunday, so therefore it's my weekly church review.  Thank God Father Joe did the mass tonight.  It was a good mass.  When we were leaving I saw Lance and just froze.  I successfully avoided him.  I don't know what it is about that man but whenever he's around I just get extremely uncomfortable.  Since he quit to persue his "musical career," I've stopped being involved at church.  Youth Council lost what little direction it had and all the activities that had been previously planned quit.  I still go to church every Sunday though, but I'll admit to feeling judged by Jolene.  I think she thinks she's some how more worthy of God because she is more involved at church still.  She'd make the perfect nun. LOL.  Joel wasn't there tonight again.  However I did see him at the mall yesterday on my outing with my mother.  I saw him working when I walked by the Buckle.  Whenever I see him, I freeze too, but in a good way.  After he graduated two years ago, I sorta just forgot about him because we were at such different points in our lives.  I mean the boy has been to Iraq and back.  But ever since I saw him that day when I was with Renae, I want to see him again.  I've decided it's not like the weird "I have a crush on him and he's so cute" thing, it's more like, "I just want to sit down and talk to him and see where he's been and where he's going" thing.  That probably makes no sense to anybody except me.  Nod if that last sentence is correct.  lol   Goodnight
