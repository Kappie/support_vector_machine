The weather was perfect, and we only had two days of rain, and there was a special type rain storm that light up the sky at midnight. We went to Sauble and got hit on by random guys, we scored a 10 on the honk-a-meter. Last night I went to the movies with Eva and my cousin, and we saw "Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban." The movie was fantastic, and I saw Alexander. HOLY CRAP he is the hottest man in the history of time, including the space time continume. It was also a good night for Eva, because she saw Emo glasses boy. We do not know his real name, but he isis the coolest in the looks department. I am to excited to write more so Hoccha and bye.
