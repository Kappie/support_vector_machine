It seems to me that  people study what they feel they most need to understand, and frequently, these are things that frighten them ."  -Lisa J. McIntyre, from The Practical Skeptic (a sociology textbook)  I am currently studying psychology and sociology. And I am damn scared of people. So this is a very appropriate sentiment. It's kind of ridiculous. I am planning a career as a therapist and half of the time I just want to run and hide from people. What am I doing to myself!? Do I really want to get into this field? Could I really possibly be successful in it when I'm such an introvert, and so often just want to get away from people? Sometimes the answer is a resounding 'get out while you still can!'... but most of the time, it's something else. It's a knowing that there is room for me in the field, there is room for me to be the best kind of therapist that  I  can be, there is room for my own idiosyncracies and anxieties, in fact, there's a need for them. Otherwise, I wouldn't be receiving such a strong call to enter the field. I have to trust at least that much.  Sure, social situations can be scary for me. But do I want to spend the rest of my life hiding from what scares me? Or do I want to face them head on, study my fears, and work through them?  I think any chosen career needs to be a dialogue. It needs to be a conversation between what I have to offer the world and what the world has to offer me  (Where your talents and the needs of the world intersect, there you will find your calling" -or something like that, I forget). I have to be able to serve and to be served. The quickest way to a dissatisfying career is getting one that doesn't offer the chance to grow and learn.  I think a career should be just slightly confrontational , just slightly out of the comfort zone. The same could be said of romantic relationships; there needs to be the potential to support and help each other grow and mature as human beings, there needs to be some 'purpose' other than the usual dribble.  Resting stagnant in security is no way to live - a relationship (or career, or perhaps anything) shouldn't be a blankie- it needs to be challenging (in the sense of cajoling me into being my most self-actualized self), exciting, inspiring,  as well as  safe, restful and compassionate.   I just started to write something about 'relationships are some of the most satisfying things in my life'... and I had to stop myself. Is that true? Is that my voice talking, or the voice of my family or my culture? Do I believe that, or do I think I should believe that? My world doesn't seem to accept/value the desire to be alone, doesn't embrace the introvert. I have always enjoyed being alone. I have also enjoyed relationships. I can't say, though, that one is more satisfying than the other, and that almost feels like blasphemy in such an extraverted world. In fact, if I had to pinpoint it, I would say that  the experience of being able to fully express who I am is the most satisfying experience  in my life. Whether that happens around others or not depends. There is something amazing about being able to be so authentic, and being with someone being his/her authentic self, and to feel that connection and openness. But when I am alone and feeling that deep easy self-expression, I feel a similar connection to myself, or even to Spirit. It doesn't seem to matter. What matters is being able to feel unrestricted, uncensored, wholely myself- which is ultimately my responsibility, my task to figure out how to cultivate that feeling in all situations.   Perhaps that is also why sometimes I am so attracted to large raucous parties/concerts-- there's a certain anonymity that is refreshing, and a certain 'anything goes' kind of attitude. People do some pretty reckless, embarrassing stuff and it usually just slides on by, is part of the scenery. I like that kind of freedom, and in that atmosphere feel accepted no matter what behavior I exhibit.  One driving motivation in my life is communication. Either on an interpersonal level, hearing and being heard, or as an individual trying to express myself via writing and artmaking. And the drive to be a therapist is in large part driven by my belief that there is nothing more valuable on this earth than to  1. Learn myself inside and out, 2. LIVE from that knowing and 3. Be able to express at least a smidge of it to the important people in my l ife, myself included.  Another driving motivation (and fear) is the experience of union... but I think I will save that thread for when I write on becoming invisible, which is another post soon to come.  I don't know if I really got to the point here, if I really tackled what that quote makes me think about or feel. Alas, can't always hit the target. Perhaps another day. Maybe it's just because it's a pretty simple concept, doesn't need a long exposition or anything. Too late for that I guess.
