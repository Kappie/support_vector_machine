Today I can't be arsed to be awake, I have no fucking energy and all I want to do is sleep, so that is what I might do!! But then again, I think that will be difficult, just my fucking luck!!      Ahh yes so anyway.............I am again going shopping, I am turning into a shopahollic....it's quite scary, I seem to find myself ineither Brighton, Worthing or Rustington at least 2 times a week! I have spent so much money, and yet I have nothing to show for it!!! lol!! But the good news is that my rents are taking me tomorrow, and they have said they will by me some stuff. Bless them      Sorry if this seems agressive, I am just sleep deprived!!      La la lal al ala al ala ala ala alalala a alala alala      hmmmm ahhh yes what else was there............oh yes, spent this morning with Kim, see we dont see that much of each other, but I got a message from her this morning, and she asked me if I could also hear the sports day (among other things) then she asked if I would go down there, and we could spend the day together (or morning) as she is moving soon!! :-( i will miss Kim, but I shall see her a college!!!      Yes so didnt get there until about 11.30, lol, just in time for the relays, lol, HIGHDOWN WON lol, how ironic, the first time us lot ain't there and highdown actually win somehting lol!!!      That also reminds me of something else.........I am considering changing courses, as in I might not take PE!! The reason being although I love it, I don't want to lose my love for it. That sounds strange doesn't it, but what I mean is, I have found out that we have to do gymnastics, and we get filmed in everything we do. I am so shite at gymnastics, that would be fucking hilarious, and filming my attempt at PE, hahahahahahahahaha, you've been fucking framed here I come!!!!      hmmm yes sooo, I am thinking about that at the moment, oh well time shall tell I suppose!!      Thats about it I think, I am going to try and get an early..ish....night, well that is the plan!! lol         Miss Keers signing off      xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
