Hmm nothing happened today cause i'm still grounded but trent and stefan stopped by for a while. We sat outside and froze our asses off in late april. How sad. That's ok....in 2 weeks it's the beach and that will be SOO amazing i can't wait! 2 words can easily sum up today: Pop rocks (consider that one word) and Foam candy (that's one word too). Both amazing things....AMAZING! It's raining in florida and that's also amazing. I heard so many stories today. Like "worm-hunting" and people walking in on their parents and poeple's moms sucking their friends dicks when their drunk....hmm. I never knew that and now i am going to look at her different. Thats wrong. But o well i'm peacin. Later yooooos
