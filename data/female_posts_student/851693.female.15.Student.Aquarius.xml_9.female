At the moment, mine is light purple.      That aside, reflections for this week. (Or last week, more like)   I had a rehearsal! After a loooong time. I had totally forgotten my lines (have to work on that), so Veron made me redo my part 7 times. Very stressing, saying the same paragraph 7 times. Faith was rather patient as she had to repeat her lines for me 7 times too!       As for exhibs, my group settled the planning on the way to the Sun Yat Sen Memorial thingy. Except that we haven't started on anything...       So. Things for me to do:      MEMORISE LINES   Work on exhibition. Start it. Get the materials ready.
