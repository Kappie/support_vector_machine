Well lets see, after my boys left around 1:45 last night, I hopped into bed, and woke up an eerie 15 minutes after my alarm went off...uh I could have been late to my meeting with the devil-the gift shop! Damn! Surprisingly after my 7 hours of sleep, I was ready and raring to go at work today! I don't think I have ever been so awake and alert at that job before! I definitely was working with  Nicole , and we recently-not always-but recently, have been getting along great at the gift shop! Its a good thing, when you have a lot in common with the person you're working with...It makes the shift go faster!  7.3 hours  of work with the one person who knows so much about you, is awesome, cause you're on the same level...You don't have to tell the whole story, you just pick up where you left off, and you don't have to explain...They just already know! Ahh...Sounds complicated, but its kind of nice!    So after Nicole and I laughed our asses off  (NB: "oh shit I just pushed the security button!," KH: "let's time um!" haha 6 seconds...pretty quick for a 60 year old!)  at her funny mannerisms, and our hard working job...or lack there of, we headed to Culvers!Today was the 20th anniversary of the franchise, and in lieu of that, they had $.84 butter burgers! Awesome! So we grabbed Joe, and headed over to get some cheap, all-American food! After that, Abby's house was Vacant for the Night so, like any other teenager, we hit that shit! haha We watched some Helen Keller movie (that abby was watching when we got there; hence had no say in the matter) and proceeded to receive my camera from Joe Jr's house. We hopped in to chit chat a while with the head of the household for the evening-Joe, and Matt. Then proceeded to be abby's bitch, and went to blockbuster to rent The return of the King; granted, this is the third time, in two days I have seen the inside of that store! I think they know me by name now! After Nicole and I moesied on over to the Snopek residence, after our rendezvous with the Finn Family,to our amazement, Brandon was over, playing some tunes with Brian on the Guitar. We made our way down to the dark and dreary basement, and popped in the final encounter of the famous trilogy, the party dwindled into 3--abby, Nicole, and myself of course! Kraus and Caleb came over about and hour and a half in to the epic tale. Oh well, I was on the computer the whole time...My miniscule imagination wouldn't allow me to be lost (haven't seen any of the LOTR...I know, I know, I'll get on that!).The fact that I had six hours of fairytale-controversy told to me, in a total of 6 minutes by Abby (enough said), I don't think it was necessary for me to be asking questions the whole time! Ahh...time to chill with my awesome friends!  Have aSome Good Sleep tonight everyone!
