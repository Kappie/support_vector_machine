Went to school, failed my physics test, came home and went to work. The simple dread my life has contained lately is disheartening; the minimalism of my days exasperate me at times. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m going to graduate early, but what after that? Appalling visions of my career at Spag lasting into my 30s plague me every time I close at work, distracting me. Distraction is so ambiguous, it can be either good or bad depending what light you choose to view it in.   My writing lately has been pathetic, I know. But today is the first day of spring break, so it can only improve. I’m going to bed now, I’m tired.  Yeah-  urlLink these  are sexy.  really, really, REALLY sexy. Hmmm….shoegasm…
