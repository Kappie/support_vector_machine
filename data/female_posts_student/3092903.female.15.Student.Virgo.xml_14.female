I could pay for her to go to the gym the next few weeks or something and make sure we really control her eating, because I just dont think Atkins is working for her anyway. My horoscope said today was a day of fun. It also said my love life would take a turn for the unexpected and something that broke all the rules of what i have learned would happen. Yum. Unsolved Mysteries didnt come on this morning and this is the one morning I will be home. Darn. Oh well, I need to read my summer reading some today. Or maybe I wont and just do something with sara instead. Yeah, she told me Lacy is trying to get her to talk bad about me. I'm sorry our little friendship didnt work out or whatever, but i was just sick and tired of her copying everything a couple of sophomores liked and did. But what did that get me? Her screwing around the words of a conversation we had and telling Mr. Davis I said something I didnt say. That pisses me off more than you can imagine. I just hope he doesnt hold what that fat ass bitch lied about against me. If she hadnt have done that, I would make an effort to be nice to her, but not now, because I have absolutely no respect for liars. I hate liars.
