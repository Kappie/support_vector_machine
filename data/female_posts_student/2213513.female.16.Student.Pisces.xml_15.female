I don't even know why im feeling so weird. i can't describe it either its like im enerjectic, depressed, pensive, nervous, excited, lonely, tired...basically a really random selection of emotions...all at the same time. I also have a weird urge to be outside, would it be totally odd if i slept outside tonight? Yeah it would. My mom would think im crazy, maybe i'll just do it. I also have an urge to be on my own, like i really want to go somewhere alone. Hmm i could go downtown to go shopping, that might be fun...well im really fumbling trying to write stuff tonight so i think i'll just end this rambling here, ta ta... *kate ~we can live like jack and sally if you want
