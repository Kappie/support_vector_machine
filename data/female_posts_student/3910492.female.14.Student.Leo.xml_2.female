Kalee doesn't know that I have a crush on Scott. Scott nearly asked me out on the phone but I told him that summer relationships suck because I am not allowed to go on dates, but I am allowed to have a boyfriend.  Okay, enough bad news, now the good news!!! I GET TO GO ON A MISSION TRIP TO DENVER!!!!!!!!! I get to go with Brittany, Ryan, Jack, Jon, Felicia, Austin, JackJon's mom, and Brittany's mom!!! We are going to Denver with our youth group and Director, Rick, to help out with the homeless organizations and homeless people! On the last day we get to go white water rafting!!! I am soooo excited! On Friday, Brittany and I are going shopping for snacks and other stuff to bring on the trip! AND! I get to bring a cell phone! My 'rents have never trusted me with a cell phone for more than 4 hours! They are letting me have one for a week!!! I am soooooooooo happy! Well... I have to go! Gonna call Scottie Boy.   XOXOXO,  Geneva
