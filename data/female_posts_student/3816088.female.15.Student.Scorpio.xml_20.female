And my parents are totally for it too!!!! It took a little talking into but they saw how happy I saw when I was reading the pamphlet and the results and so they are going to allow me to get it done!! The best neuro surgeon though that my dermotologist knows is in Arizona so my parents are thinking about going up there for vacation during thanksgiving or christmas and while we are up there I would get my surgery!!! I am soo excited!           I have been looking into it for a while now and know exactly what they do so I am totally ready. All they really do is like open this spot in your chest and clip the nerves for my hands and then also clip some nerves in my underarms. So I guess ill have a little scar on my chest but its supposed to be as small as orthroscopic and i already have some of those scars too so this will be no biggie! This has totally like made my summer the best one ever!! I am soo tired of having this problem and am looking foward to putting an end to it. No more ice cold hands and no more fears!!!          Also today i went driving with my dad just around my neighborhood and my brother got soo uptite. he was like dont change the lumbar, dont run into anything, if you mess up the windows you pay, if you run into anything and ruin my speakers you pay, or this one is my favorite...dont mess up MY car! ohh Im sorry but its MY car too you ass!!!! He is acting like i have never even been in a car before. So when i got outof the car I was sure not to move the seat back or move the mirror or the wheel because he seems to know so damn much that he can just do it on his own!! I know Im so mean but he is just acting like a total jerk. Im not an idiot I know how to treat a car.       Also to make matters like much worse my dad is tempted to cancel our trip to Hawaii! I am like going crazy. When we were in St.Louis they had the annual "blood bowl" badmitten game and my dad threw out his back somehow but it didnt start bothering him until he got home and then yesterday and my brother soccer game he rolled his ankle and is now on crutches so my dad is thinking about not going to Hawaii this summer and going to Austrailia or something during the winter. Im just like whatever! Im still packing though for it because I dont think he will cancel but you never know.      Well I got to go and drive again at SEARS. I am soo scared..I am such a bad driver!! I just can not seem to get it :'( Oh well I guess I will get it sometime soon...I hope.                                        i love you!                                   heather
