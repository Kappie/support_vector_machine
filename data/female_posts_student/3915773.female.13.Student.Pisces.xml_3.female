The Gregg Spiridellis claims, “We’re hoping the buzz from this helps build our reputation and our following.” Well, the 3.7 million downloads of the film seems to show that the people want a good laugh.  Even though this video is about politics, I think it shows that the Spiridellis brothers seem to know good P.R. They are absolutely right in thinking by putting this video out their people will want to look more into their animated work at JibJab. This just shows that the Internet can be a very effective tool in reaching mass audiences. Now all those millions of people that downloaded the video associate it with the JibJab Media. The video has even made news on national television stations. One simple production at the right time can have success, but I feel that this could only have been done thanks to the Internet. What do you think about JibJab using this video to gain reputation? Is it ethical to make a movie about the political candidates? Would “This Land” have been a success without the Internet?
