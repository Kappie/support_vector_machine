We don't quite know where Laura is... Me and my brother have kind of mucked up, we both forgot to get my Mum a birthday present and her birthday's during the holiday (9th) but she wants one from England! So we're kind of throwing a few ideas together and trying to get her Shrek! She's wanted it for ages, wow, another stupid kiddy video to add to our collection! Yeay! Mmm... we are quite dumb with presents at our house. Hey wow Izzy, you got one of those flying cars? Wow... that would be ...weird, wouldn't that be a weird sort of aeroplane?
