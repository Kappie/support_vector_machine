Alyssa didn't wanna do it at first because she said she was flat out  broke(it happens when you're a teenager,lol) So she watched. After that we went back to her house it waas like around 12:30. Sat around watched a little bit of American wedding...we got antsy and couldn't sit still. We called Nicole to see if she wanted to come shopping, but she didn't have a car to drive. So screw that idea,lol.  Alyssa then decided that she wanted to get her nails done, so we scounged around the house for money FINALLY i got Jordan(alyssa's sister) to lend her some $$. And we go over to Lana's nails to get it done...they charged her more,but they look cute. WHile she was doing that I got my eye brows waxed and wow theyre thin, but oh welll. As I was paying the lady, I noticed that I had money that was missing from my wallet, it just didn't feel right, so I told Alyssa about it. Seconds later Alyssa's sister's friend's mom called ALyssa and was like "did u give crystal money because she said u did" and Alyssa said no. SO after she got off the phone, we put the pieces together CRYSTAL STOLE MY MONEY OUT OF MY WALLET. We calculated everything I spend and in the total I was missing $7. Haha me and ALyssa got Crystal in trouble...shes not welcomed over alyssas house anymore,lol. Alyssa is happy she hates the bitch, shes like 12 and as annoyin as hell. If i see that grl again im gonna beat her,lol.  I love my nails, they look CUTE! ALright...its time to go eat. This weekend its just me and my mom at home.everyone else is going up to tahoe.
