She wears purple eyeshadow and dark red lipstick, but no other make-up. She wears jumpers that flare way out around her feet, and tiny leather tennis shoes. She's hard to describe, but she reminds me of a witch. Awful, I know, but it's just the truth.   She's mad at us before we come into the room. She's standing there scowling as we take our seats. I sit on the first row, and when everyone passes their homework up, she snatches the papers out of my hand as soon as I touch them. She couldn't be but 5 feet tall, yet she is the most intimidating presence in the school. And, she hates me.    She has hated me since my second day of school, when I changed from regular algebra to her honors class. As soon as the guidance counseler told her I would be joining the class, she looked straight at me and said, "Oh, no."  And that was how I was introduced to her. She has plagued my life ever since.   However, while I am suffering in the area of algebra, I  have actually learned several things in her class:  1. I will never, ever wear purple eyeshadow 2. If, when I am a teacher, I ever get to the point where I hate my students, I am going to end my career, for my sake and their's. 3. Spraying students with a water bottle is an effective way to end their mid-class nap, and serves as entertainment for the other students in a typically dull class. 4. Algebra does not bring happiness. 5. I must never, ever, take an honors math course again. 6. I am SO ready for summer!
