Well i sleep in untill 11 today(so late!) because last night we, Sebastian, Ben, Nicole, and I, played hide-and-go-seek at DQ -in the dark-!So much fun.  Then Everbody came over and we watched "The Italian Job"  and ate snow cones, which I made, until 2am.  And the night before we t.p'ed our boss and Sebastian.  Forking and all.  Oh, and um I met this freaking hot guy at the "Open Show"  (right Krystal!) on Sunday.  That's my days.  I'm outta here!
