So, this morning, I went to school, all dressed up and preppy in number-one dress, just for the Awards Ceremony. I was expecting at least an hour of boring ol' Mr D and not so old but almost as boring Mr Y. Then, Murdles kindly pointed (yes, much pointing) out my darling mommy, who was, I thought, on TV for an Ontario book club special. And then! Murdles pointed out my darling  daddy , who was supposedly at work and yelling at his employees' insubordination!! At that point I became suspicious.    I  knew  that my sister had won the Intermediate French Award.   But, as everybody is well aware of, ei is very often wrong when she says she  knows  something. Though my sister deserved that award (STUPID MO), it wasn't her. 'Twas me! Looks like my sucking up and participation in the Eversley paid off, folks. 'Lil ol' illiterate me got the Intermediate English award. I got three rounds of applause, too! Mostly because I walked down / up the stairs so slow, but still...   And, it looks like my friends are geniuses. A got the Intermediate Science award, Britnix got the Intermediate Art award, and MM got the Intermediate Spanish award... and jeez, who knew there was a  Guidance award ... *falls off chair* (looooserrrrr)   And then! After being almost positive that my debonding (aka FREEDOM FOR MY TEETH) appointment was on Saturday, mum runs up and says, "Caleigh! We've gotta go to your ortho appointment!" And I was like wha.. ? But I went! And now my teeth are brace-free, except for a few permanent ones behind my teeth that aren't ugly, and a retainer that makes me talk with a horrible, horrible lisp. But that'll go away in 6 months, and it'll officially go away in 2 years. I had no idea my teeth were so big. I am also very proud because there are no blotchy spots on my teeth, either. That's right. I  brush my teeth , you unhygienic slobs...   But there's more! The Civics exam I had like... 30 minutes ago was fantastically easy. The essay especially. All in all, I think it went very well and I am very proud of myself ^^;   But there's even more! I had piano last night, and PN said I played beautifully and I think I got him to stop worrying. I only practised a little bit, too. Of course I have the recital next Saturday, which sucks, but once I screw up in that I'll never have to do it again, which is superbly cool.   So anyway, now I'm stuck here till 4:30 because my dad has to pick us up and he can't get here at 3:10. *sigh* This is starting to become a habit. Fortunately, tomorrow's the last day of school (woo!), so that's only a little bit longer. Everyone is sad that grade 10 is finished. I'm not. I'm not happy, either. I think I am an emotionless freak who only gets upset at things that aren't real, like  The Scent of a Woman  or  Beautiful Mind  or something.   BTW, A, my post was totally longer than yours ^^; There  is  some use for staying till 4:30 in school, isn't there... I can show up A in my amazing typingitity! *cheers* *bashes champagne bottles against various ships* I am going to run out of champagne soon. It's just such a festive thing though; I can't help myself!   History exam is on Friday. I'm okay with that; history isn't too hard. It's actually pretty easy, because everything flows. Everything makes sense. See, math and science aren't like that. You can't guess how multiplication works because you know how to subtract. History, though, you can figure out the patterns! It's just all about human reactions and stuff; easy-peasy lemon squeezie. To quote Mrs. WW. She's cool. We came to a bit of a truce a week or so before the debate, and now we're good.   It is now 10 to 4. I'm feeling kinda hungry, except I can't eat anything solid for 24 hours. Well less than that now, because I got my braces off a while ago, but still. It was originally 24 hours, so we'll stick with that.   How about this? I'll list all the books everyone should read to be like me, k?   -  A Game of Thrones  -  A Clash of Kings  -  A Storm of Swords  -  A Feast for Crows  (soon as it's out!) -  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  -  American Gods  -  Neverwhere  - All  The Sandman  comics - All the  Calvin and Hobbes  comics -  The Onion Girl  -  The Ill-Made Mute  -  The Lady of Sorrows  -  The Bone-Doll's Twin  -  A Room of One's Own  -  The Land of Og  -  The Arkadians  -  Uther  -  King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table    Guess that's about it. These are all fantastic books that I love very very much, and they all have an honoured place on my bookshelf. I think these books explain why I think the way I do. They could also explain why I see things that nobody else does. And why I am just a bit afraid of the dark. Only when I'm alone in the house, though. And when it's nighttime. And when the dog is outside so nobody is there to cuddle with me.   I'm officially hungry. Maybe I'll waste away to nothing before my dad gets here, and he'll be so overcome with remorse when he sees my shrivelled skeletal dust that he'll vow to never keep his one remaining daughter waiting again. Ooh, better: maybe  N 's hungry  too , so  she  can waste away to nothing and I can just bask in the knowledge that I am an only-child and my dad will always pick me up at 3:10.   I am such an evil sibling.   It's 4:00 now, and I have nothing to do. It's very boring. It's a pity they blocked all the game sites; I like games. Maybe I'll waste away of boredom or something. Or hunger. I even took my shoes off, and I'm not struck with any marvelous idea of anti-boredom. This is scary. Normally, when I take my shoes off, I'm just bombarded with marvelous ideas of anti-boredom. I am honestly worried that my shoeless creativity has vanished. Because, you know, that's where I get all my ideas. They come up through my ideagnetic socks, zap through my feet with a little bell-sound and then they echo around in my chest for a while. Sometimes, the really good ones, hurt a bit, because they bounce so hard against my skin. Finally though, the Mindful Hoover sucks them all up through my neck and into the processing factory. They get processed, and since they're all marvelously fantasmical they always get through in one piece (unlike many with-shoe ideas). My Muse finds the best one, and that's the one I use!   No, actually, I don't think that's how it works, but since nobody knows for sure it could definitely be a possibility.   When I become Queen of the World, I'm going to do 3 things:   1. I'm going to make it illegal for anybody to be taller than me. Those that are, will have their heads (or more, depending on how tall they are) chopped off.  2. I'm going to make a huge palace full of cakes. No one will be allowed to go in except for me. 3. I'll ban all uniforms from schools! And throw all ties into a bonfire!   It is now 4:20. ZS is here talking to me, so that's cool. He's not a bad guy. I hope he can't read this ^^; So anyway, I'm gonna publish everything before he realizes I'm writing about him... Byee!   BTW, A, I totally beat you ^o^
