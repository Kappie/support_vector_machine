But I had a fun weekend anyway.. cept for that awful haircut I got yesterday... gr... Sue, sue I tell ya! Well I guess I fixed it for the most part but... gr. On Friday... lol that was an interesting day... it was sunny and warm... me and Charlotte wanted to go to the park but Erinn wanted to go to the mall to see if that girl was working at Spencers... well we went to Southcenter and she wasn't there of course... so we went to Taco Del Mar and had burritos. Charlotte's mom was gonna be at her bf's house all night so she invited us to spend the night with Charlotte. Oh yeah... my guinea pig died. Right before we left to go get Erinn I went up to the cage and... yeah.. My mom was really upset because she loved that thing. I'm sad he's gone, we had him for so long, but he was older than guinea pigs are supposed to live and he had cancerous tumors and stuff, so it's probably about time.   ....ANYWAY...  At Charlotte's... Erinn brought her digital camera and a bag of fabric and clothes that she wanted to alter and sew and stuff... I didn't feel like it so i just put on a bunch of the fabric and we took some funny pictures... We got bored around 9:30 so we went driving... never drive with Erinn. She's a crazy-ass driver. Oh my god. We almost got kicked out of Safeway (apparently you can't take pictures... or, you know, throw food etc)... then Target was closed... but haha we pulled into a parking spot opposite this couple making out in their car.. that was great... *deer in headlights*... we had these cap-guns (don't shoot anything but make a loud noise and a spark) that we took funny pictures with (Erinn's a gangsta, yo) but yeah uh this cop started following us... i think it was the flashing camera and the sillhouette of a cap-gun.... yeah for like 10 minutes.. that wasn't cool... actually it was pretty funny... Good times.  Yesterday I had a bad haircut at Hairmasters (i look like a friggin Beatle.. not to diss them of course, but I don't want to LOOK like one!!! >;@) then washed it out and dried it myself... then me and Jeana went to the mall and I got this really cute pink dress for 15 bucks (sorry that was waaay too ditzy a sentence.... wow...). Had a date with Ryan, we had yummy ice-cream and snuck into Eternal Sunshine... just as good as the first time, maybe even more interesting the second time. I now have ticket stubs for Secret Window. Ate go-gurt, you know. Then I fell asleep watching "Sleepless in Seattle". A fulfilling day.  I woke up this morning at what I thought was 11:30 which was actually 12:30 (did everybody set their clocks today?) and watched Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window, which is the best Hitchcock movie if you ask me.. but basically yeah I'm on my ass all day. Fun.
