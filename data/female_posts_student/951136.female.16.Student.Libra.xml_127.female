It might actually come true, god damn it!!!! ...last day of summer school, so ironic it makes me sick. i had  three weeks. but stupid wanker me sat there and read my book for hours at a time!!!! What is wrong with me!!!! i want to cry. I noticed him the first few days, but he was sticking pretty close to Sarah, so i was like, whatever. but then this wednesday, we did our CPR testing and we spread out in the Ninth grade cafeteria to take the test, and he sat behind Sarah, and faced me at my table. and we are always the first ones to finish tests. everyone else is so damn stupid in that class. but hes really smart. And when we were done we walked back to the class and were standing outside the locked classroom and ppl walked by us saying, he told us to just go and sit in the next classroom thats open! but him and me were like, no we;d rather stay here. what does it matter? and ppl were tlaking around us, and then i noticed he was kinda looking at me, as if it was the first time he'd actually seen me. and then him and this girl started talking about Simon and Garfunkle, and he loves the Beatles, and all that kinda music from the 70's. and i was just standing there listening and my heart was melting!! i wanted to hug him and be like  ME TOO! me too!....but i didn't. stupid me. and then i started catching myself following him w. my eyes whenever he got up to do something. just watching him. he's really funny. he sat in the corner, and always did this weird stuff, everyone liked him. And today he was standing at coach lemmons desk and i was watching him and he turned and looked at me. and we just stood there looking at each other(jessica moment!) and he kinda had a smile on his face. and then i saw coach hold out his hand giving a packet to him... he didn't notice, he was just looking at me. and so i smiled, and laughed and looked down, and he turned and was like Oh! sorry coach... and walked back to his seat. then we took our test. and i was the first done, and then he finished and got up and i got up after him to turn in my packet.(thrilling aint it?!....)it gets better... later a bunch of ppl were playing cards. being loud, and i was sitting there like the nerd i am reading Mists of Avalon. 5 pages and one sex scene later, he just walked over and sat in the desk next to me. and i was like, hm, he's probably just watching the History channels 'Police Risks' of the TV...i seriously thought he might be interested, so i stayed to my book. until ppl behind me started talking to him about taking german and french, and i couldnt' very well stand to have that! so i turned around and started listening in and commenting. adn then this girl asked me what i take, and i said french, (he smiled at that) and they wanted to hear me say something in french. and He takes german (melt!) and is going to take french next year (double melt!) and we started talking! heheh....now thats a thrill if i've ever experienced one. and i already knew his first name - gordon  OK- HOW CUTE IS THAT! how many gordons do you meet! that is the cutest name!!! and it fit him perfect, like, you think gordon -what a weird name, but he was cute, and you look at him, and could never picture a single other name that would fit him. gordon does. SHA!!and his name is like, Gordon Freidman Joseph.. Something the Third! I CAN"T REMEMBER HIS LAST NAME!!!!! AHHHH! but it was soo cute! and i got to talking to him about names. the ppl around me were like your name's what? and the girl from england was like so you take french? ya i thought you might -Genevieve sounds french(i never used Gena in that class) and i said my parents were going to name my bro gordon, thats how i noticed you when they were calling the roll, i like that name alot. but they named him garth and he was liek wow! You both have really cool names! and each second i wanted to just die! he was sooooooooooooo cute you guys....i just want to cry... and then we had like two minutes and he went over to his desk and picked up his pen and a piece of paper....DunDUnDun oh! he might get my number. How cute would that have been!!! but i was flattering myself. he didn't. he just stood there in front of me and looked shy and   So   cute and then the bell rang. and he stood aside and we walked together to the door. He held the door open for me. i wanted to cry! and we talked. and then he had to turn left to the west lot and i was going down to the parking garage....sigh. and he said well, bye! and i said BYE AND HE WAS GONE!!!!!!!!! i wanted to cry right then when i turned and left.... and my four minutes walk from mrs mchans hall to the garage was the longest i've ever walked. i left him. YOU GUYS!!!! I left a perfect guy! i mean, i could not imaging a better person.  ever . He wasn't hot, not by far. but  so  cute. really, i can't explain. he's just one of the guys in the back you would look at and be like, eh. but to me he was so cute. He is going to be a Junior too... so no age difference. no freshman. He goes to Mayde Creek...Gordon.... SHA!  THERE IS NO GOD
