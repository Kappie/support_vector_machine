I don't think I can really blog much right now... But I'll try my best. >oD      I'm still pissed about the whole 'not getting his number' situation... But I should be over it in a few days... Through comfort eating, schlumping around and moping. I can't help thinking about the whole degrees-of-separation thing.. Right now, it's like, two degrees..  Okay , I'll stop talking about him now! See how obsessive I can be at times? >oP      It's so good to be back at school.. I missed everyone.. I even missed sitting in Maths daydreaming and not understanding the work... My bud Anna came back from globetrotting.. Brought me some stuff from Budapest, ain't that cool? I let my bud Carah borrow my A Hard Day's Night DVD.. She'll have more time to watch it, now that her Japanese exchange student's gone...      *looks to her left* Radha's not working... She's blogging too... About her 'boyfriend' Darren.. I've met Darren, but when I asked about whether something was going on between them, he made a face that made it clear that he wouldn't want to touch her with a ten foot pole..      I'm just looking for tips on how to make a flyer's layout... Got 4ish minutes left... Better stop blogging. I'll blog again later!
