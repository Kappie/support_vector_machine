Friday night me and Jake went out to Putt-Putt and I won. Then we went and ate at a gas station...lol...which was an adventure and I didnt get home until 12am. Then saturday I woke up at 8:15 to go to my dads so that me and Jake could clean out the spear bedroom and so that we could make money. Then we went out to eat and came back so I could get some clothes and talk to my grandparents...we came home did...I cant remember....oh yeah I went to Jakes to watch movies and stuff and came home at 1am...woke up at 11am and Jake came over we ended up going out to burleson. Then I went over to Sarahs with Jessica and stayed the night. Then I came home today at about 2 to do my chores and stuff and went to Jakes to eat dinner. Well tomorrow theres no telling what Im gonna do...then later friday if anyone wants to go to the movies we're going to see Little Black Book. But well for now thats all I have to say and Im gonna go to my room and stick the phone to my ear for I dont know how long. Till then, Later Days
