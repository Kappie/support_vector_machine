All this while trying to do my fmp apps which i totally forgot about until yestereday...and trying to do them as fast as i can because i still have 3 possible english in class essays to prep for. And then i realize i have to go to confirmation class-i'd skip it, but i dont have time to make it up later. At confirmation, i realize im incredibly freakin' cold and i start to fear the worst--am i sick? The night before an in-class essay? The night before the only day to turn in fmp apps? The week of finals? Oh crap! So i get home and i take my temperature--100.3. Holy Shit! Nooooooo! Well, i know i cant go to bed yet cause i have a ton of work to finish, so i take an advil and keep working until im done with fmp and 2 essay preps-at about 1:00. All this while shivering my ass off and trying really hard to concentrate...My fever goes up too...bouncing up and down between 101.2 and 103.0 (a good majority of the time it was 102.3 though). I decide i'll get up early-5:00 to finish my essay preps...can i probably do at least a whole one in an hour, right? And maybe it's okay if i only get 3 done, because the chances that she'll pick the two i dont do are 1/20 and the two i would have chosen not do do are very similar...i figure my english teacher isn't gonna pick both of those because all of her essays would be the almost the same. So i get up at 5:00 and start working...having not been able to sleep very well because i kept waking up shivering... i get about halfway through one of my essay preps before my mom comes in to make sure im awake like she always does at 6:00 and she asks me how im feeling. i can't lie...i tell her i still feel awful and she makes me take my temperature again--102.5. and to tell the truth, now my stomach hurts and im coughing a lot (well, i was coughing before too). She tells me shes not going to let me go to school. I beg her...literally... to let me go...suggest maybe ill just come home after the first 2 periods (my health test and my in class essay). She refuses to allow it. she lectures me on how important my health is and how ill probably do bad on the essay if i go to school sick anyway. I really truly beg her to let me go...crying, even...because im so frustrated that i have to be sick. She tells me my teachers arent going to kill me if i miss a silly test, i can make it up later. I explain that its the end of the semester and the essay is part of my final...and finals are incredibly important...and i dont know the procedure for making up an inclass essay but im sure its very unpleasant and Ms. Voelker is going to be very angry with me. She tells me again that i cant help being sick and that my teachers are going to have to understand, picks up my fmp applications and tells me she'll give them to heather to hand in, and that theres no way shes letting me go to school. She says this one final time and leaves my room saying "Go back to bed."   Ahhh! im so pissed i have to miss this day. I mean, i am sick...but...ar!...God dammit. I dunno how im gonna make this stuff up... I guess i have free periods during finals...and no fencing after school...maybe i can do it then. But then i lose a lot of my free time...time to study. which i need. ahhh...this sucks. a hell of a lot.   how did i get sick anyway? It just appeared yesterday. Probably result of the crappy food saturday and the fact that i got no sleep the night before...and that i was really exherting myself and stuff... and my stomach did hurt for a while that day... hmmm... God dammed Culver! Why did we have to go to indiana the weekend before finals? Whyyyyyy!?!?  oh, i really hope i didnt get pang sick. *loud, nervous swallow*  *Sigh* I guess i might as well go back to bed...  i hope everyone else is having a better day than me. this sucks. this f**king sucks. and i'd better not still be sick tomorrow...cause...oh crap. this is so not good. i hate this! arrrrrr!  im so pissed right now... just so...so pissed. This is anger mostly not based on sadness, if youre wondering... unlike the anger resulting from no emily...which is entirely based on sadness. if anyone wants to know.  okay...bed.  and did i mention this sucks?
