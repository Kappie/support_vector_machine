Dr Johnson said - forgive my slightly morbid fascination for the archaic - that we must make or find our own felicity.  Perhaps that was where it all went wrong, in that unspoken expectation that someone - you, actually - would provide it, ready-wrapped for me.  But you could barely keep your own from slipping from your grasp, could you, as you slipped from mine?  I have spent so much of my life trying to hold on to things that turn out to be as insubstantial as the water droplets that bead the window panes.  I can half imagine all those abstracts - love, power, wealth, hope, luck - pooling on my palm like mercury, dripping between my desperate fingers leaving only silver swirls and lunacy in their wake.  Maybe it's lunacy that has brought me here, now.  On this train to nowhere, or at least nowhere any sane and civilised person would choose to go.  I press my palms to the misted windows.  They leave an imprint of clarity that very soon clouds over again.  What am I doing here, I ask myself.
