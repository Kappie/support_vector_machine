Usually they're heartfelt, but I don't think a lot of people notice the sincerity. It's ok. I don't think people are meant to understand me. Maybe it's because of the fact that I don't want them to understand me. If everyone understood me, I would be dead. I would no longer bring madness, surprise, excitement, mystery to life, because it would just be suspected. I wouldn't be able to rebel because I wouldn't be taken seriously or people would be like it's about time. I would be Jane Doe. Miss Average. Just like the rest of the world. The rest of Pop Culture which should burn in hell. So until next time, don't try to figure me totally out. Don't take me seriously all the time, but you gotta recognize the times you need to.
