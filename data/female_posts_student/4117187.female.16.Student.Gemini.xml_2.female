I already have a journal on  urlLink http://www.greatestjournal.com/ , but I decided that since everyone reads one, I need one for just me. I need something private that nobody else reads. I know that nobody I know uses  urlLink http://www.blogger.com/ , or at least I don't think I do. If they do they have the same idea as me.  Anyway, I guess I'll start with yesterday. Yesterday I went to the movies with Jeff and then went over to his house. My mom really didn't want me to go, but my mom wasn't home so it was really up to my dad anyway. Around 2, Jeff picked me up, and surprisingly he was the one that was actually driving! He only has his permit, but his dad was in the car so it was alright for him to pick me up. Anyway, he drove out to the Phillipsburg movie theaters and we went and saw "The Village" at 2:15. It wasn't the best movie in the world, but that's okay because I didn't see the entire thing anyway. Moving on.. After the movie Jeff and I waited in the lobby for his dad since he went to see "Bourne Supremacy." Once his dad's movie let out, we left and Jeff drove us back to his house.  Jeff and I ended up at the computer as always making out and messing around. There's nothing new there. We were watching launch and a slow song came on so I made him slow dance with me again. I love dancing with him. I still need to teach him how to fast dance, but slow dancing is a start at least.  Later we ate dinner with his parents and his grandma-- chicken, rice, and string beans and carrots. Once his mom said that we could go, we went back in the computer room and were just making out again. Yes, we do a lot of that but what do you expect when we see each other once a week. We catch up on the talking part every night so when we see each other, we'd rather catch up on the physical part of our relationship.  Around 8 his dad drove me home, which I didn't really want to happen but I really had no choice. Jeff had given me his webcam before we left so that we could see each other every day when my mom won't let us get together. He's going to buy another one so I can see him too. Wee! He's glad he gave me the webcam because he can see when I'm smiling and laughing.. which is all the time, but you get the point. :)  Today was pretty much just me messing around with the webcam and sitting at the computer telling people that I didn't want to let them view my webcam. It's amazing how many bastards are out there that just want to see your webcam hoping that you'll do something sexual for them or that you're wearing provacative clothes. The only reason I have that messenger is because the webcam doesn't work on AOL instant messenger.  Anyway, there's not too much else for me to talk about, and I better try and see what's wrong with Yahoo messenger and the webcam because it says it's not connected. Jeff should be getting home soon and I know him -- he's going to want to see me as soon as he gets home.  I'll be back next time I need to vent or talk about something personal. I don't know when that will be but I'm glad I have something here that nobody else is going to read. Bye!
