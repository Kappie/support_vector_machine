When the female had her first and inevitable set of kittens, he turned the tom out to fend for himself.  When the kittens were weaned, the dam followed and wandered into my back garden.  Never able to dismiss an animal in need, my housemate and I began feeding her.  It wasn't long before we realised that she was pregnant again.  We contacted a cat shelter who agreed to take her for the duration of the pregnancy.  They would help re-home the kittens and would ensure that the cat, now named Minx, would be spayed following weaning.  But, alas, the day before the shelter was due to pick her up, she delivered.  We had no idea where the kittens were, and all attempts to follow her proved fruitless.  We, of course, continued feeding her at a rate of about 600 grams per day!  When her food intake had dropped again to a more normal 300-400 grams, we realised that she was no longer giving milk and that the kittens had died or been killed.  We immediately contact Cats Protection League who helped us arrange for Minx to be spayed.  Unfortunately, by the time our application had been processed, the poor wee thing was pregnant for the third time! in six months!  The vet proceeded with the spaying, aborting the kittens.  Because her system was so weakened by the relentless cycle of pregnancy and delivery, there were complications during the surgery.  Poor Minx also had to have a kidney removed.  She has spent the last two days in lonely, miserable pain from surgery, has endured the lost of a second set of kittens in six weeks, and will need to have her kidney function tested regularly for the rest of her life.  She runs an increased chance of renal failure as she becomes older because the one kidney remaining will have to work harder.  That risk is a fatal one.  This animal never asked to be taken into my neighbour's home.  She did not ask to be used as a breeder and then turned out.  She was his helpless victim.  His irresponsibility was cruel and has resulted in life-long health problems for a beautiful animal who deserved far better.  If you have pets, be responsible.  Get them neutered.  To do otherwise is not just irresponsible, it's cruel.
