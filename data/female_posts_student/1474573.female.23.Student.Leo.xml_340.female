Had to clean the house up, cook some food, prepare some other stuff, do some last minute food shopping and somewhat babyproof the house.    After all was said and done, we had lots of fun with them.  AND I finally got some people to play my "Scene It" game - all movie trivia which was a helluvalot harder than I thought it would be, which is kinda cool!  Anyway, yesterday I was supposed to go to dinner with a friend from out of town but we resceduled it to tonight because a) we were beat and b) it was icky out.  Ended up seeing  The Day After Tomorrow  and vegging out at home watching  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King , interrupted by  The Sopranos  and  The Dead Zone  in the middle of it and then back to the movie...  Didn't get to sleep until about 1:00am.  Again.  I dunno what's wrong with me lately.  I can't seem to get to sleep at a decent hour.  I have so much on my plate right now, it's annoying and yet I'm enjoying every minute of it.  Tonight, dinner with My Los Angeles peeps and their friends.  Tomorrow night, Rich's feature at Acentos.  Yes, I'll be there.  Wednesday afternoon/evening, finally planting those begonias I bought for the front yard.  Thursday, food shopping for the party.  Friday, cleaning the house for the party.  Saturday, cooking for the party.  Sunday, party.  Monday, cleaning up after the party.  After that, who the fuck knows?  It's all about the party, people!
