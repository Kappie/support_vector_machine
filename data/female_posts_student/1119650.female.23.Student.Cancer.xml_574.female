Even though UConn "kicked me out" way back when in December, 1999 I am still considered a student there.  So I don't have to apply for admission, I just have to get reinstated.  I have to fill out a form and tell them what I've been doing for the last few years.  There is one small catch still, but I think I have that covered as well.  Keep your fingers and toes and paws crossed, please!  Weeeee!
