Ever the firecracker, his email was sharp and to the point.  Here it is...  * * * "Choice or Chance  We all have the ability to choose what we want from life. We cannot control or predict everything that happens, but we can make thoughtful decisions and actions towards designing our own life.  Often we get fooled into believing that it is wiser and better to stay in our current circumstances. We convince ourselves that we might not be successful in our attempts for something else. Fear of loss, regret and failure stalls or completely stops us. We start to believe that something will shift on its own to make our dream happen if it was meant to be.  Therefore, the only possibility of getting what we truly desire is by chance.  Consider that protecting what you have by "keeping things the same" is no guarantee that they won't change on their own anyway. Your job may become redundant and market demands may shift. Your friends might move and your partner may change his/ her mind.  Consider that where you are now does not represent where you will always be. Nothing is fixed. In fact, as we grow, a step backward may enable two steps forward.  More choices than we think  Take a look at our choices. Often, people see their choices in terms of yes/no, win/lose, stop/go or good/bad. In reality, there are very few decisions or actions we take that only involve a black or white solution.  More times than not, there are multiple outcomes. We, in fact, have many more choices than we initially see.  Seeing more possibilities creates space, flexibility and opportunity.  Beyond actions, we can always choose how we think, feel, act and respond.  We choose our beliefs, our perspective, our outlook, our priorities and our response. Embracing our ability to direct our thoughts and feelings delivers us a stronger sense of purpose, confidence and satisfaction.  Do you have a better chance of getting what you want by hoping it will happen or taking an active role in making it happen? If your ship sank, would you make every effort to find the lifeboat or float around in the spot you landed and hope that someone found you there? Choice offers you the opportunity to actively participate in the making of your own life and increases your opportunity for success.  From the Book: Knowing Your Strengths (The Gallop Group, 1999)  Cheers,  Mark  P.S. Over the past few years I have had the "Importance of Statistics" rammed down my throat. I am a true believer that statistics do not represent the quality or quantity of work that an individual may perform.   "A persons day to day routine is not always routine".
