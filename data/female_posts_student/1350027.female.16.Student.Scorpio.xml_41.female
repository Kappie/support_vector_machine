Dust particles seem to have really got along with what the german books had to say as they seem pretty much at home and I had to ask them to get lost with the help of Mr. Tissue.  I'm so scared I'm going to fail my end-year super-important-certificate-to-be-given-if-passed German exam. If I fail it, I'll have to resit G1 again. That's another whole year. I need to get to G2. I need to know how to say more german besides my already trite "Ich spreche nicht gut Deutsch". It doesn't matter that I've mastered each syllable and it's pronounciation, it doesn't matter I can say it as easy as I can say "OH WOW WEE WOW" - I have to develope abilities and brain power to say more. I have to be able to proudly go around reciting all Goethe's german poems and works and say all them german vocabs properly and be all masterful at the language.  I have to pass the damn test which I'll be sitting for on the dreaded day of DECEMBER the 18th.  Perhaps I'm worrying too much. But then, I should worry about it's not so far away. I mean, it is... but it isn't, y'know? I mean, I thought it was February but it's really July..No wait, It's already August? I mean, don't you see how fast time is passing by? It's faster that my fingers clicking on the familiar keys on the keyboard as I type this paragraph. Tick tock tick tock. Seconds are sprinting faster that anything in the world. Time is so limited it eats at your conscience. It just eats, and eats, and eats and your paranoia reaches such a high stance that you will eventually blow up and your body will give in to a nervous breakdown.   But why is that? Why is that you ask? Simply because we're always incapable of handling everything around us as fast as we're suppose to. We're too slow at absorbing and we're too slow at dealing with our enviroment. We just think we can, so we take in more and more - but in black and white reality, we're incapable. We're innate to believe that we can, but we can't. No one told us we can't. Everyone says we must try and try and try and if we try it'd be possible and all that bullshit - but we can't. We just suffer and drive ourselves to the brink of overloaded anxiety and stress and that's why so many of us are dropping like flies from heart attacks and why we're all growing more white hair and having many more wrinkles.  It's terrible what we're becoming into.  Where was I again? Yes, my german. So anyways, I've done Lektion 1 and will find somemore "will" to memorize the questions and get my fat ass to do the same with the rest of the Lektions I'm forced to truly understand.   I wish I was a portege who picked up language as fast as I pick up chocolate and understand it's ever soothing sweetness and taste. But alas, I am not that fictional charater Gaia from the book by Francine Pascal called "Fearless" and neither am I, Adrian Monk's older brother, Anthony Monk.  Languages for some vile reasons; HATE me.
