I was listening to err...a cd me and my friend made a while back...and it made me think, I never see her anymore, and I just generally miss hanging out with all my mates. Well I'll do what I haven't done for a long while...  Today: I had a shower, walked to school with Frankie, we had a good chat about life...it was cool. I got there, and just generally socialised...and accused Michaela of performing some kind of sexual activity and a certain someone...;)  First lesson was art, it was great, my work is actually starting to look good! I was trying it on with everyone! Even Mr kIng ;). Well yeah, I said I wanted to suck his phallus, and I've fallen in love with someone else...Sam Hayden...there, I confessed...he is officially now, "my relationship". I hugged him for ages and he's just..mmm......Sam!  Second lesson was english, it was ok, we just did some of our essay for when we come back in 3 weeks, we've got work experiance soon, and I'm pooping myself!!  At break me, Lettie and Tab, it was cool...Mr Bardsley is a new target to seduce ;)...just kidding, I don't dream about seducing my teachers...which leads me to my third lesson...  Science with Mr Ryan, :P, we were doing an experiment, Sammy was being pleasantly nice to me! It was great! I even got a hug! Lol...he made me a bracelet and I've sooooooo got over him *rolls eyes*...  Fourth lesson was p.e, it was great, we were playing "tennis volley" and Miss kept saying: HERE WE GO. So me and Tab kept singing the Geeks song, it was great, then we started calling Miss a curse because she kept making us loose dammit! :@  At lunch we went down Lettie's...but she wasn't there! So we hung out with Larnie, it was cool chatting like old times again, although I felt a bit awkward...but she's my sister dammit! I can't feel that way, they bought a double bed for Larnie especially so I can sleep with her! I used to stay round hers for months on ends you see...  Last lesson was well I can't remember yet...wait a sec...oh yeah, it was maths, I got the lowests results on the second test, as well as the first, I got 19%...I'm becoming so bad! Well yeah, it was a laugh because Tab laughed in the Bitch's face...  Tab came mine after school, then we went Pig's, Kris came, Tab left, Kris left then me and Pig just hung out, and I edited my site loads...  Well that's all, so until tomorrow  I LOVE SAM   Lol, oh yeah, if you ever read this Len, I love you, even if spelling my MoMmIs name is a disability.  Take care and Toodlepip xxxxxxxxxxxx
