Today had to be in my book, one of my most incredible day ever...Today was my Christian Baptism and I feel incredible. I was surrounded by my family. My mom, my husband and my 2 daughters. My brother Dan and his wife Janice , who is an incredible person, mother and also help me go thru very hard times and showed me the way to God, without pushing. They also brought their son and daughter. It was most unfortunate that my oldest brother Mike and his family were not there.   I found the Lord when I was at my lowest of everything. It is too bad, that only then, we think of Him. Because when things are going great, you feel you do not need Him.  He has been part of our lives now for a while and I have never been happier since then. People who know me and have not seen me in a year or so, cannot believe the changes in me and my family. Before I found the Lord, anytime anyone talked about Him, I got angry because it seemed that He was not there for me. Little that I know that He was there but I didn't listen.   Before you judge religion, always take a good look inside your soul and see what your true beliefs are and then ask yourself if you believe in the Bible and what it says.   I did that and found that I had completely lost the values of the Lord and what He preached. I have found comfort in reading His word and praising Him. So for me today,  St-Jean Baptiste is more then an occasion to celebrate our National Day.....It is my Baptism...   We finished this amazing night with fireworks in the parks with our friends and neighbors, who are the same.   I want to thank all the good wishes I've received today by my church family and from friends and family that couldn't be there. Thank you to My Pastor and the Youth Pastor that got into the water with me and to God in giving me salvation and re-birth.   Have a great Sunday and Holiday Monday and...... Be good
