In fact I actually went to bed at one, which is about an hour and a half earlier than I have been going to bed, but for some reason I could not sleep. I guess I'm over-tired, ha.  Well I have to get up in three hours (oy...talk about a contradiction in terms), so I'm going to go attempt to sleep again.    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  wanting to sleep  listening to/watching ::  WinAmp   eating/drinking ::  nothing  craving ::  SLEEP  talking to ::  ----  thinking about ::  SLEEP  wishing ::  i could sleep!  wearing ::  pjs  random ::  I WANT SLEEP!
