"Some people come into our lives , leave footprints in our hearts , and we`re never , ever the same again ..." i agree alot wif tis quote given by my primary sch teacher .. Fate had let it b tt i got to noe him for tt short period of time , but ive got no regrets . at least , i haf memories to look back to . these r juz part n parcel of life ,n , ive gone thru tis 4 times ? d 1st time was when my paternal grandfather died .. when i was 5 .. he doted on me alot .. d 2nd time was when i was 11 .. when my dear shirley left me ... d 3rd time .. was when i lost a fren in sec sch ..... d 4th time .. was when Jq stepped out of my life .... but .. its ok , if therez reali fate between us , one day we'll definitely meet again . He's someone whom i will always remember , He's someone whom i admire alot , He taught me how to love , cuz he was the first person i ever liked . from tt , i learnt tt love is pain , love is miserable , especially unrequited love :) But i know , he's not te one , becuz now , Ive found the one who's meant for me , n we spend each day happily together :)   Dear Shirley ,  on o6 June 2oo4 , there was d'J Party{Japanese Culture Day} @ Faber house Park , a part of Singapore Street Festival .
