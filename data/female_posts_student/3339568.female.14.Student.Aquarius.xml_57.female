Ok, so mel and I decided to go to Chatswood to buy Jess's present for her b'day party on Saturday, and we decided to buy her a ring that had an engraving in it that said "Happy 15th, Luv Mel and Beth" So we went into Prouds jewellers and we had to wait about 10 mins to get help from this lady, and she came over and she snapped "YES?" at us, and we asked to try on some of their rings, and shes like  "(sigh) Ok....." so we tryed on the ring, and we didnt like it so we were asking to try on other rings and shes getting more and more pissed at us, and we finally find one we like, and we were discussing whether we were gonna get it, because it was a bit expensive, and she starts tapping incessantly on the desk and looking at her watch, so we decide to get it and she totally shuns us, pushing the ring into our hands so we will get out, and giving us dirty looks the whole time we're in there!   I hate it how you go into a store and the security gaurds stand there giving you seedy looks the whole time your in there until you leave, just because your a teenager. One time Mel and Gemma and KC and I went into this party store and we were looking around and the lady gave us seedy looks and turned the securtiy camera on just because we were in there! Ahh, i hate people like that! But the engraving guy was nice, he gave us a discount so the cost would be easy to split between us. Don't you love spontaneously nice people. Thanks for that God. But the only good thing was that we tried the new blueberry Boost, and it was soooo good!  I had one of the most traumatising days of mi life today! We actually had to see a baby being born, and it was sooooo GRAPHIC! The whole video was so gaphic. It showed a penis ejaculating and inside a vagina and penis during orgasm n stuff - im like "i SOOOOO do not need 2 see this!" And we actually saw the baby being SQUEEZED out! Ahhh, it was foul! And we had these seminar speaker people, and they were all like assuming we had already had sex, and im like "HELLO! We are 14 years old! And we are a CHRISTIAN school, and the majority of our year, including me, don't believe in sex b4 marriage!" Mayb they r just used to public skools. And she taught us how to use the pill and everything, we even put condoms on the bananas. I'm set 4 life now! ;) And she also said "Now when you go to parties and binge drink, and take drugs, you can lose control of your body and have sex" NO-ONE goes to these parties! Ahhh, come on. I still feel sick from that video. I mean, I'm usually good with these kinds of things, but honestly, this is too much...
