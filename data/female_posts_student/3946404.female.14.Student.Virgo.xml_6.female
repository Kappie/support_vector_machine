Sat at the table out there and put my head down.Mom (Ms.Wendy...I will call her...Mom (W), mwahahahahahahah!!!!)was taking Cindy to work and Cindy leaned her head out and said "Bye". It got my attention, so I waved and said bye back.  That was it... It did start raining while they were gone, but I didn't move. I didn't care. What's a little water gonna do? I'm a big girl...I can take a little water. Well, anyway, When I saw that Mom (W) had gotten home, She went inside and a bit later, Jojo came out. I didn't do anything about it tho. He was walking back and forth, obviously trying to get my attention, (he does it often, so I know) but this time, I didn't want to move. I still felt like he didn't really care. After a while, I got up and walked off thru my backyard to the street on the other side... I started walking up that street, trying not to cry again, cuz I started to feel bad. I looked thru the houses to the other side. My street. Guess who I saw walking down the street, following me...? Jojo, he was walking down the other street watching me. Whoa, caught me completely off guard, sorta scared me. I didn't know quite what he was doing. What a stalker.. I still didn't think he cared or wanted to talk to me tho, so I continued to walk. Maybe he just felt like walking too...  Not to far up 130th street, there was an old lady. She had a walker, and she was trying to carry a garbage can. I figured I'd stop and help her, you know? It would also give Jojo some time to walk ahead of me so I could watch him, not the other way around. So, here's me, about to stop and she stops me and says "Scuse me, miss. Would you please help me out and take this garbage can back by the steps for me? I fractured my hip in 2 places, so it's kind of hard for me." Of course I did it, but got all mixed up with where she told me to put it. So here's stupid me, like "Here?" "No" "Here?" "Umm, right beside the steps honey" I almost walked into the backyard. The woman put power in her voice.. "No! Beside the steps. Over here, honey." I was pretty freaked out then. Went back to her and she started talking about how her roommate fractured her ankle and it healed up wrong. Poor them. I could see Jojo up ahead waiting forsomething. Maybe me? Well, anyway, she couldn't drive and her roommate couldn't drive. I had to ask how she got around and then she started talking about hoe people from her church do things for her.... Hey, that's cool. There's lil old ladies at out church who have to do the same things. I told her how I go to church ALL THE WAY down in N. Miami Bch...I was really curious about why Jojo was stading there, so I kept staring over at him, just to see him staring over at me. Wow. That stare is pretty powerful. It obviously meant we needed to talk... So, I tried to get the lady to, well...shut up.. Man, that sounded kinda mean..I wanted to get away, so I told her that maybe I'd stop by sometime and see if she needed a hand or anything. Bingo! Got away safely.  Walked right past him.....well, I almost did, but couldn't bring myself to do it. I asked him what he was standing out there for and he asked me if I wanted to talk. Of course I did, so we went over to the playground and talked in our usual spot. A family came by with a kid, so we left, and went to walk around. During that whole walking around time, we'd stopped and were in between Maya's house and the vacant house next door to her. I was still pretty upset, ready to cry. He kept making me smile and laugh... I hated it, yet, I loved it at the same time...   It got me mad, but made me happy.   *shrugs*   Whatever, after that, my day was great.  The only thing that made me sad after that is how I'd already asked Cindy what day she wanted to go to the mall with me and Taylor. She said Thursday.Later, after she hung with Maya, she came up and told Jojo how her, Deserae (Dunno if that's how u spell it..), and Maya were gonna go to the mall on Thursday. No mention of me, or Taylor. It hurt, yeah. Whatever tho, I should know not to make plans or anything.   *shrugs and sighs*   I slept with like...a bunch of my stuffed animals and junk last night. It made me feel better. SO much better. If I ever mention suicide in here, know I'm way too scared to do it cuz I know I'd go to hell. I really don't wanna go to hell..... I mean, It's   >>>  HELL  . Anyone who wants to go there is absolutely stupid. Anyway, that's all for today... I wanna go try to beat Shawn at Chess....B Byeness!!!!!
