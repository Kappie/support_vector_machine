I hate TOM and MICHELLE right now!! they just had to schedule fucking practice for today...the day my family decides to go to des moines and go swimming and hang out with all my cousins!! and then i have a million other reasons i would NOT like to go to practice at all including: 1)its a fucking heat wave outside, 2)i have an enormous head ache, 3) id rather not say its kinda personal. GOD my life sucks!!
