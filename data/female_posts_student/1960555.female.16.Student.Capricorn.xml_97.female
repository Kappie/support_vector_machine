Today for instance, he ignored me early in the day, but by class he was doing his usual look over at me (kinda to see if I'm watching him, i think) and yea.  Then in the hall after school he winked at me... or gave me a cute/funny expression like he does sometimes, but really, what the hell.  Hey, can we send some more mixed signals please?  I like him and supposidly if he hasn't realized my amazingness, he's not worth my time.  I want him to be worth my time.  I really do.  But maybe he doesn't know that I think HE'S amazing.  misscommunication strikes again.
