Today Mahinda taught me how to make my blog actually fun to look at, with links and pictures and such, so it may get a big exciting for a while, since I don't know precisely what I'm doing.  We already put a quite large pciture in, and it looked rather silly, so we made it into a link instead.  Yey for technology.     As far as prom goes, I think Paco and I are pretty much ready, wich is amazing considering neither of us knew if we were going last week.  All we have left is to decide on pictures.  Two weeks to spare!  He even signed us both up without me even saying anything, I was very impressed.     Today was way fun, Mahinda, Wonder Woman, and I went out into my woods, and found some really neat stuff to takes pictures of.  Mahinda got to use her new camera, and Wonder Woman finshed her film from Hawaii.  I think it would be really fun to be a photographer, but I want to have a nice house, and a little family, you know, the American dream.  To live like that you would probably have to be near as good as Ansle Adams though, and I'm not.  So I was planning on becoming some sort of doctor, because science really interests me too.  But I can up with a new plan.  I'm going to marry the maker of Apple computers, and then I can photograph stuff all I want, my children will be geniouses, and I get all the free software I want.  How awesome would that be?  Pretty awesome I think.   I was also inducted into the Mermaids club today, I watched the movie, and it was so cute.  I ran out of stuff to say however, and it's getting about time for bed.  So ttfn.  I'll see you on the flip side.  (I just now understood the origins of that saying.)
