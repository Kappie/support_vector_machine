Not only is it the Friday before a long weekend, but I came to work today to find the following email from the Comptroller, my department head: "Gwen, With your upcoming involvement in the Budgeting and Accounting processes we are  transferring your function and direct reporting  from Joyce to Mary.  This will be effective September 1, 2003."  Now, when this happened to my friend Anthony (transfer of function) he became a financial analyst.  From how it is explained to me I am to be doing the exact same thing as Anthony, I will be supporting the Budget Driector and the Chief Accountant.  This is really exciting for me becuase while its not been expressly stated the transfer from Administrative Staff Assistant to Financial Analyst means a change in unions as well as a pay increase to put me on the same level as Anthony.  Knowing that its a unionized environment I am not gonna hold my breath waiting for the raise, but Financial Analyst looks much better on a resume than Administrative Assistant.  I am SO excited.  Not to metnion the fact that Mary is much more amicable and agreeable and far less nosy than Joyce.  Wooo woooo wooooooo!
