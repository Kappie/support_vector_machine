So from about... July 31st on back the entries are from my old livejournal site. I just thought that I would let everyone know.  If you are a friend from my livejournal site- welcome. :) {Emily, Trish}  So not a lot has happened since I last posted... Yesterday was my brother's birthday and in the morning I drove to Jamie's {which reminds me--- Emily I WILL give you credit for the cast list-- as it was of genius material :) } anywho- so I drove to Jamie's and then I got into his car and we went into Langley. We bought my brother his studs and some balloons, and then we went over to Joe's Island Music to pick up Jamie's new guitar and a gigbag. VERY nice guitar if I might say so. I especially liked the strings- they were this awesome color. *stares at strings*  So I went overtown with my family later where we... went to Walgreens so I could buy chapstick, and then we went to Traxx, this indoor racing company that kicks ass. It was really awesome. My brother and parents raced the "go-carts" (they're not really gocarts- but that's what I will call them) and I um... well I talked on the phone with my lover. For um...33 minutes it appears to be. We listened to music... and talked about shoes... and plans for the summer. So then I had to go so I drove my brother up to the Old Spaghetti Factory and I stood outside and took pictures for a while until my Grandpa and mom arrived, and then we had dinner. yay.  So today is my MOM'S birthday- and we havent done anything yet---- they're cooking eggs and working on the network it appears. Im trying to figure out the best way to give her her present. Hm. If I get the time Im going to make her a mix cd too. Tomorrow I think I am spending the day with either my family or Jamie- and then later on in the day my sister and Andy and I are going to drive up to the drive in and watch a few movies. I dont think we'll be able to stay for the last one but I hope so--- It's White Chicks and I thought it looked really funny. :P But its at the top end of the island so it would make for a VERY late (or early in the morning) drive home. It probably wouldnt be over until 2 or so. I dunno. Anywho--- Ok well I'm off to jump into the shower... ahhhh.  I'll update later.
