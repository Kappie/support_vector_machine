Well i'm about 5 6, With black, blood red, and blue hair. My hobbies are slaughter, shiny objects, trying to find a way to use my full powers without destryoing this pathetic body, training, and your good old messing with peoples heads! I carry one katana, one sakabato, a cross bow, and two .45 magnum six-shooter revolvers, and a quiver of arrows. So that be me, Oh i have an amulet of a dragon on a cord around my neck, family heirloom and is used to contain my power.
