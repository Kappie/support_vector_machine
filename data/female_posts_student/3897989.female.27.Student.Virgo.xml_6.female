To guide your heart across the waves Praying you won't forget?  Talking deep inside your soul With gentle, misty sprays Harboring your insecurities You've let go of a few days?  Stormy nights so brilliant Lightening exciting and new So many things I've longed for All, did I have chance to do.  A craving is left so deep Within my essential being To ride a higher wave My childish fears, fleeing.  Carry me back, dear Sandman To the greatest of Wow Moments Each night when my eyelids meet To fill me with atonement.  BLG  P.S. Can you imagine what I have planned for another trip on the tides? Endless are my ideas, expressive are my thoughts, exciting are the palpations of my heart.
