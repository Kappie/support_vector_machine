They said this about the dangers of journalism, “The number of journalists killed in 2003 leapt dramatically thanks to the war in Iraq, and many more were arrested or censored, placing the state of press freedom on "red alert", according to an international media watchdog.”  Along with the 43 global journalist deaths, 14 of those deaths occurred in Iraq. This death toll is the highest since 1995, when 49 journalists were killed, 22 of those deaths being in Algeria.  Some of the most dangerous places for journalists are Columbia and Asia. The Middle East has been dubbed as the worst area for journalists. The Gulf War and the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts are responsible for 16 deaths. Conditions in Africa have worsened because of wars and civil conflicts. It was reported that Latin America was pretty stable in the area of press freedom. In Cuba though, the leading figures of the independent press have been put in prison. There is good news for journalists because the European Union has “satisfactory” conditions.  This information is interesting because a journalist would have to be very brave to want to cover the wars globally. Someone like Carol, from the NPR radio station that we visited, would have to have dedication and ambition to cover and investigate these topics. These journalists risk their lives to inform the people of the world.
