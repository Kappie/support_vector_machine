It all started with my Grandma...last May she had eye surgery because she had a hole in her eye. Then June my Grandpa had his kidney out because it was cancerous. They thought that was the only place he had it in his body but they were sure wrong. Hes had brain cancer for atleast 3 months now. Thats what caused the kidney and the bone. They just didnt know about it till now. *sigh* So he has 9 more radiation treatments...and hopefully that will do it. Now they are getting my Grandma a hearing aid because she really needs to hear him and she wasnt to happy about it but shes going along with it and then yesterday my aunt Phyllis had really bad pain and she was getting some drugs but the pain got so bad they rushed her to the ER where they found out that she needed her gall bladder out. *sigh* So she had that surgery today. Wow. Tho theres been some good news through out this summer....bad and good. Ive gone through this emotional rollercoaster. Its crazy. Up, Down, Up, Down, Up Up Up Up, Down, Up. Heh. My mom is sooo happy I have Arik. Otherwise Id be a wreck. Hes helped me more than he probably knows. I could talk to him and he made me smile even if I was pouring out tears. *sigh* Life is so crazy. But from now on...I really am going to live everyday as my last. I know now that I should do that. Don't live in the past...live today. And that way..I dont think I'll be depressed...being happy is the best. I feel soo wonderful now. I'm having the time of my life. And its all good. No regrets. I also found out from the school that I get my own locker. YES! no more...someone. I saw that someone today...she smiled and tried to be nice...I was like...yeah...whatever. Kim named her something else to...bad name haha. Asslick lol...Yeah....anyways. Life is good..and I can't wait till Friday! It'll be great to see Arik again. I miss him so much. *sigh* Well today is my Grandpas 74th birthday so the whole family except my aunt whos in the hospital will go out to eat. So yeah...I just really hope he gets better soon. Life is looking up at the moment...life is good.  -Tara
