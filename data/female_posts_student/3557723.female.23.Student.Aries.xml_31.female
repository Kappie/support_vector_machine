It saddens me to leave it, even if it is for six months. I've enjoyed my 6 months there and have learnt so much about air travel and cargo and freight transport. My knowledge at the start of my employment was nothing compared to what I know now. And the knowledge base is ever growing.  And here is a link to my workplace's website. I didn't even know that they had one until now!  urlLink Golden Eagle Airlines
