It was actually a fairly okay day, i found out one of my good friends is in my English class, which made me happy.  I did get lost twice tho :) which is kind of sad since one of those times the class i was looking for was fairly close to the one i left, lol.  I had to sit through many a lecture on classroom policies, got some fat books, and got a huge headache listening to my spanish teacher babble away saying things that i couldn't understand.  It was actually kind of funny, because she wouldn't talk to us in English so when we tried to ask her what she said she would try to explain in Spanish, which would just confuse us more.  We were all looking at each other with completely confused faces, and I could hardly believe she actually thought we could understand everything she said.  The irony here is that the period after Spanish is... drumroll please.... English!  So I'm having a hard time switching back and forth so fast, from Spanish 2 to British literature.  BORING, but i have to deal with it.  Well i don't know what else to talk about, so if i don't have much homework i'll post tomorrow.  I already have homework tonight!  Like, actual, homework!  Grrrr!  I better get to it, so ciao!
