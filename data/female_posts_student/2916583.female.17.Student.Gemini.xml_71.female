I read Shaheen's blog, wrote one post, looked up something for the post, and accidentally switched screen names, therefore losing the post.  Anyway, it's been a while since I've written, so, naturally, lots has happened since then. Probably the best was my cousin's wedding.  I want a wedding similar to theirs.  They had it at this church I've been DYING to see for myself, and everyone's right: it's not as big on the inside as one might think.  Of course, I want to tie the knot on the beach, or somewhere close to the beach, so that's not a problem.  When I was little, I said that I would wear a bathing suit underneath my dress, and just tear it off and go swimming in the ocean after we said our vows.  Anyway, back to their wedding.  The bridesmaids looked pretty, and SOME of the groomsmen handsome, but what really stole the show were the flower girls, the bride's assistant (is that the name for the girl that isn't a flower girl, but walk down the aisle?), and especially the ring bearer.  Those girls were so adorable.  They had on little wedding dresses, and I swear that one of them looks just like Ruthie from the early years of of Seventh Heaven.  The ring bearer was maybe four, and when he got to the stage, he laid down on the stage and almost went to sleep!  It was such an awwww moment.  Anyway, Stephanie (the bride, not my cousin, who was a bridesmaid) looked like a princess escaped from a Disney movie.  She even had the fair skin and red lips to match.  I could have never pulled off the dress she wore, but she looked like a princess on the way to a ball, awaiting Prince Charming.  I'm not sure if my cousin Benji (it's still weird to say Ben) is Prince Charming, though.  He's very considerate, sweet and gentlemanly, but he's a bit obsessed with Nascar.  After the wedding, my mom, sister and I (my dad didn't come - Benji is my mom's nephew) went to the reception.  Until the wedding party came, we got stuck with all the relatives I dislike, except for Richard and Teresa.  Richard's my mom's brother, and Teresa's his wife of about a year and a half.  I don't usually say uncle or aunt before my relative's first names.  In fact, the only adults I don't call by first name are my maternal grandparents (Ganny and Papa; my dad's mom I call Maria, step-grandmother Cruz, step-grandfather Jose - yes, in English that translates to Mary and Joseph - and I'm not sure what I call my grandfather...I suppose I'll know when I get back), most teachers, strangers, our persnickety neighbors, and some people at work.  Anyway, when Donna and Clayton (my aunt and uncle, the groom's parents) arrived, they separated us, thankfully, and put us with all the extended relatives I like, and down to three I dislike.  I really like two aunts (Donna, my mom's sister and Teresa), and two uncles (Clayton and Richard), my grandparents, and a few from Clayton's side.  The reception in general was very entertaining.  Of course, when you're given a camera and allowed to do whatever you want with it, you're gonna have fun.  Jenni and I took some goofy pictures, and some pictures of the cake cutting, the first dances, the toasts, and the bouquet/garter throwing.  Jenni also got the two hottest groomsmen to take pictures with her, one of them being the one who caught Stephanie's garter (Stephanie the bride).  (One of Stephanie's sisters caught the bouquet.)  The only downside was the food.  Most of it tasted terrific, but something we ate disagreed with us, and my sister, mom and I all had stomachaches.  It may have just been too rich after a week of peanut butter toast and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (peanut butter and soup were about the only edible thing left in the house - my mom picked up a couple of things from Wal-mart, breaking her annual "I refuse to buy groceries right before vacation" speech).  Teresa also taught me that you do a crossover instead of a shuffle during the Electric Slide.  I was taught, incorrectly, to shuffle instead of step, cross (left over right for all the guys reading), step.   The wedding was pretty much the high point over the past few days.  Sunday I had to work eight and a half hours, the longest I've ever worked (I've done seven and a half hours before, but not eight and a half), and I was on my feet for five hours straight.  I know it sounds like whining, but I simply can't pull 14 hours like the waitresses and kitchen staff can, even though some of them are a bit hefty.  After about three hours, my feet fall asleep or feel like they're being pricked by needles.  Then, on Monday, we spent the day worrying over a family thing (I don't want to talk about it).  Tuesday shouldn't have been fun, but, terrible as it may sound, it was.  We spent part of the day at the hospital.  This is even worse, but I actually like hospitals (except when I'm a patient).  You can look at the newborns, go to the gift shop, go to the cafeteria or McDonalds, go to the coffee shop, take a walk outside or inside, or watch TV.  However, I have learned something not so pleasant about hospitals: the gift shops are very overpriced.  They wanted $20 for a bear that sang "Happy Together" by the Turtles ("Me and you and you and me, No matter how they toss the dice, It had to be, The only one for me is you, And you for me, So happy together, I can see me lovin' nobody but you, For all my life, When you're with me baby the skies'll be blue, For all my life").  Given, it was adorable, but not as adorable after after I saw the price tag.  They also had these puppets that sang a note when you moved their mouths.  I was playing with a pig, and figured out that it sang "Old MacDonald Had A Farm" and another song I can't remember.  My sister and I had made sugar cookies, but we decided to buy two balloons and these animal magnets (we got one white cat with blue eyes, and a husky dog that looked a bit like a mixture of our dogs).  The lady attached them at the bottom as weights, but she tied the ribbon around the magnet animals' necks.  Later, I untied it and put the ribbons around their waists.   Anyway, other than packing for Puerto Rico, those have been the hilights of the week.  Sorry it's so long, but I haven't really been able to write that kind of stuff in the notebook.  Be assured that the one I write when I return from Puerto Rico will be even longer.  Later.
