(funny how our rooms are directly next door to each other, yet we still use instant messanger to chat, technology is ruining our world i tell ya!!)   Fish in the sea  You know how I feel  River running free You know how I feel  Blossom in the tree  You know how I feel It's a new dawn  It's a new day  It's a new life  For me  And I'm feeling good   i feel that this is a good way to start off july. New beginnings and all that crap.   Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know  Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean  Sleep in peace when the day is done  And this old world is a new world  And a bold world  For me   if u want to read the chat just visit her blog and click on "the chat" (what a creative name)by the way i'm dirtypeaches89 and she's xSolange87x on the chat   urlLink my sisters blog    Stars when you shine  You know how I feel  Scent of the pine  You know how I feel  Yeah freedom is mine  And I know how I feel It's a new dawn  It's a new day  It's a new life  For me  And I'm feeling good                                           -Feeling Good, Muse
