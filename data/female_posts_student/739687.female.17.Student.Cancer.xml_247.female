And why don't we care? Why do we allow or lives to spiral in a downfall to such depths of destruction? Why...because our recovery is beautiful. We lose control, and we lose ourselves. A lost soul is a painful thing, but in the end, it's findings are lovely. Falling astray is a thrill, a dramatic escape.  I'm sick of drama. Sick of the downfalls, and the recoveries. I'm well over the destruction.  I think my randomness is complimentary of my extreme fatigue.  Keep it random, crazies.
