(United States)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    haha. Politics. I can sorta get in to politics, but only on a philosophical sort of level. I love philosophy. On the other hand, I hate politics on an issue by issue basis. I can't get in to that boring, monotonous shit. I like the full spectrum of things. I can get into political theories and stuff. I think that's why i enjoy reading stuff from Ayn Rand and George Orwell. Because of their great political views and stuff. But man...I'm definately not the type to like get in to all the world matters and business and shit. I just hear briefly and vaguely about what's going on.  Anyways, enough political bullshit. I give this "wonderful democracy" about 100 more years tops. Because there are alot of weaknesses in our government. However, I won't go in to detail about those opinions, because, frankly, I'm not that bored.  Ok, adios you crazies.
