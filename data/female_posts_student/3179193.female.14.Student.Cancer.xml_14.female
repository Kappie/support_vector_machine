We took that stuff up and after lunch for 5th and 6th period, I went downstairs to the kindergarten rooms with Mayhar (or however you spell it) and helped out there. It was a lot of fun. That kid... Jasmine reminds me of Felis. Blah... went outside during first recess and I practically freezed! Didn't have a jacket on and yeah... Erica came and kept me warm a little and got Kwan to lend me his white shirt so that I can put it on and keep warm a bit. Didn't expect it to be this cold... Haha! Oh well. Mayhar is one funny guy! We messed around a bit downstairs in the kindergarten room and stuff until the kids got ready for the activities. Wow... really tired today. Had NO sleep last night! Scaryness. Haha~! Went to bed around 11PM but didn't go to sleep... just stayed up all night and thought about stuff. Crazyness! Anyways... yeah. I'm not going to volleyball on Tuesday nights anymore. My guitar lessons changed to Tuesdays and they end right when volleyball starts... so unless we have a lesson cancelled for some reason then I won't be appearing on that volleyball court on Tuesdays anymore. Hmm... Nima said he'd call before he left today but that didn't happen. As usual. I've learnt to just forget about it if he says he's gonna call. He never remembers. Blah... whatever. Don't care anymore. Guys are so dumb sometimes... -__-"
