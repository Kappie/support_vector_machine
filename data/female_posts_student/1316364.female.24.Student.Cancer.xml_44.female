I de-thawed my wedding cake and to my surprise it really didn’t taste that bad. I took two smaller pieces and froze them in a separate box and wrapped it up very tight (I am going to attempt to send it to Jesse). I miss him a lot. I know that that is a common theme in all of my postings but if I told you otherwise I wouldn’t be telling you the truth. It is very hard when your best friend is far away from you. Jesse is my best friend. As I sit here today, I find myself only being able to think of how wonderful it would be if Jesse were home. I thought that if I packed up my life into a cold dark storage unit that I could deal with the separation a bit better, but that is not the truth, even when all of his things are neatly packed away, I am still surrounded by things that remind me of him. It is very hard. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to forget about him all together but at the same time I don’t want to have that constant reminder that he is in Kuwait and not at home.   He has been gone since November 29th (He came home for 4 days in December) then I went to see him for 6 days in March, before he left for Kuwait. I think he has been gone long enough and now it is time for him to come home. I know that this isn’t going to happen and still for some reason there is a little bit of hope inside of me wishing that he was on his way home.   I just miss my best friend, my husband.
