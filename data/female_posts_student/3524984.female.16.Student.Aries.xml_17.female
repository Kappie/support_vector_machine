And to try to come up with a subject for every one of them would be too hard. I have a... >Blurty >LiveJournal >Melo >MySpace >FaceWhore >Blog *duh* >Greatest Journal Ok, so no wonder I don't find the time... I also have some journal's posted in various MSN Groups. I'm such a space invader. Oh. Almost forgot. I'm over Rick forever. He told me he was staying in Calgary for the school year, since his Grand-parents are willing to keep him. Oh well. Plenty of other fish in the sea I guess. Heh. *sad* I can't help but be. Anyway... I've been mostly updating   urlLink  my melo   , my   urlLink  MySpace    and   urlLink  LJ   ...So, check 'em out if you want regular updates. You may have noticed that my last name has changed on my profile. I've been adopted. Once and for all. I'm probably going to be living here for awhile. I'm out of Tim  C's. =) Now, here with my Gram Gram. Oh, she so nice. But it's late and she can probably hear me... typing... and my limit is like midnight for online crap. So this is it. Until next time, ShyShay [~]
