I say almost because it is only 2 am, not 3 am. Damn,  you people  wouldnt even know anyway.       Did NOT catch my Matt Damon last night OR tonight. Saw this band last night at this bar, not THE BAR, but this other bar. Still cool though. They went from playing  The Steve Miller Band , to  Outkast , to  White Zombie  and  The White Stripes .      Ended up being twenty minutes late for the  Beach Boys  concert tonight. Oh darn. Walked about two miles, through horse crap, mind you. They really need to strap on those  bag thingys  for the county fair. Although it does give that  county fair atmosphere . So thats why they leave it for little kids to step in and then say, "something smells".....  all damn night .   Mo is real good for that too. He'll say that in the public bathrooms, while he is trying to look under the stalls. Tonight he kept running into the womans  behind  while we were in line to use the facilities. Conversations Ive had with Evan make me think Mo will be quite the ladies man.  Gotta keep that little boy in line.         No comments welcome section tonight, but you can comment on   how   cool you think I am for keeping ya'll informed of the  never changing  set lists.         So here it is. Go, have fun. Thank me some other time.
