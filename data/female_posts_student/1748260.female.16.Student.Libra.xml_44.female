We went to brother's godparent's parents house before that.. sounds complicated huh? Well .. this year my red packet money is so darn little.. it's getting lesser  lesser each year... If not for my brother's godgrandparents.. no idea how to address? Think my red packet will be like... haha damn little.. my brother's godgrandparents always gave the most.. every year without fail... they're so nice... if only everybody was as "da fang" lol.. dream on man! But frankly the amount they give is even more than my own relatives!! Well I guess my hope for getting a nokia coloured hp with camera is gone.. urlLink   .. I can't even get a digital cam.. urlLink   .. *sigh* .. urlLink
