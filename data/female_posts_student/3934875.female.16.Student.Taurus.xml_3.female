If you get there before i do,   Dont give up one me   I'll meet you when my chores are through   I don't know how long that'll be   But I'm not gonna let you down   Darling, wait and see   And between now  then,till i see you again   I'll be loving you   Love me...      You know,there was one point of time....A few days b4 my yayi (grandfather) passed away, he asked my grandma whther she loved him..It was quite loving to see such conversation between them cos I never in my life,saw them ever saying that they love each other.Well,my grandma told yayi that she loved him..And in fact,she asked him the same qsn.He replied in a flash " sayang..kiter sayang awak" in translation meaning that "i love..of cos i love you" I was quite amused and tickled to hear that..I learnt that you must tell one how much you love them..Before its too late. Oh yeah..he hugged me on the evening b4 he passed away. I didnt expect it to be our last hug.But fate is not writtenin my hands.Only God knows how deep my regrets are for not asking him for forgiveness before he went away.       I.Was his favorite grandchild amg the 16 he had. He and my grandmother took care of me when i was little.But i was pampered by him the most cos i was the youngest to be taken care of then. And he never lets others forget that Im his favorite. Even aschild back then, I used to get treated like a queen. My yayi,wld pick me up from my kindergarten lessons.. And instead of going home straight, i would demand to go to some provision shops to get some munchies.. He would always give in to me.. With a smile on his face. I have this teddy bear that I've been sleeping with since forever. And its somehow connected to my yayi cos he sewed my bear a plaster on its ear. Why? Cos back then, my older siblings and cousins used to kick it around.. And i always cried.. Holding its already-there-velcro-plaster in my hand.. My yayi.. consoled me and sewed it for me when i was sleeping..It mite sound so lame.. But heck it, i love it all the same. Its the little thing he does that make me remember him the most. Gosh..Theres so much about tings we shared together. Our evening trips to the coffeeshop where he had his kopi and i wld be placed in a 20cent per minute toy car.. Theres so much life in the memories. If only I could relive it once more.. But thats impossible..       Lesson's learnt. Tell someone you love him/her b4 its too late.   And I'll make sure i do. But there's no such person rite now.   I just quite ended something with someone few days ago. Wont go into that though.   Anyways.. Im clueless as how to upload pics and music in my blog here. Eh jepah,if u reading this.. Go get urself a blog soon. And then lead me the way how to make my blog nice nice ok..    Oraites then.. I'll be writing later.. When i get freakin bored or have too many seconds to spare..    Regards
