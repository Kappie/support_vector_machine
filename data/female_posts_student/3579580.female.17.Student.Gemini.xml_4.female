I used to think that blogs and "Live Journals" and such were for the computer nerds, or the poor unfortunate souls who didn't have anyone else to talk too... but they're not! I can't quite tell you what they are for yet, but I will tell you soon.  So far I only have one Blog viewer, Sam.  Keep it quiet baby.
