Today...yes first day of school, we'll get to that in a minute...every 20 minutes I was getting these damn hot flashes. It's almost embarrassing when everyone else is freezing and you're nearly sweating you're so hot. It's awful. Every 20 minutes. This is sooo awful.  And to make things better...I have a panic disorder. Yes...yes...I'm freakin' falling apart. Endometriosis involving surgury and an assload of meds and then a panic disorder. Which I don't think I'll go on meds for unless I start getting more frequent panic attacks. Right now they aren't so bad...they're somewhat rare. I had one about two weeks ago though...what a bitch.  So first day back for my last year of school. Hurry hurry let's get this shit over with.  Then HENDRIX. Pray God. God willing. Please. God.  So my classes this semester are...yes...kinda tough. But not impossible.  English 4 AP Sociology (blow off) Calculus AB BC Microeconomics  Next 9 weeks I have AP Psychology 2nd period and Macroeconomics 4th period.  Okay crazies...live large.
