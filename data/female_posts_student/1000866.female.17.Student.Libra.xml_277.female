They took one of the jetskiis out, and had a tube attached behind it, and it was only a three person jetski, and we didn't know you weren't allowed to have more than three people, with the tube attached and all, and we got stopped by the sherriff!!! Peter offered Dieter for ransom while they went and found Uncle Timmy. It was SO funny. So, we just got a ticket and stuff. But, it was funny....
