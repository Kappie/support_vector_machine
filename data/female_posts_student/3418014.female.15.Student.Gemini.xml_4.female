And what does The Nod mean? The Nod isn't a nod like we are saying yes, that nod is more like The Bob, when you are listening to music. The Nod usually tends to go out ward and slightly up, always with eye contact. I've noticed that The Nod, is either used when saying, "hey," is socially unacceptable. Last Sunday I was at the supermarket and saw my brother's friend (although they never spend time together anymore), he goes to my school, we know each other, while we never talk. Well, he works at the supermarket and saw me from down the isle, to acknowledge our liaison, he Nodded at me. Saying "hello," would have been to personal, and waving is unfashionable, so, you Nod. This is a 'friendly' Nod, but other Nods seem to suggest otherwise. I pondered this while sitting in the car, as we drove along the boulevard, I saw a guy, about my age, sitting on the balcony of his apartment, I decided to Nod at him. He Nodded back. Not a 'friendly' Nod, since we do not know each other. Instead this was an 'I'm checking you out' Nod, his Nod back was an 'I accept that you're checking me out, and I, in turn, check you out aswell' Nod. This Nod has more to do with the eyes, and sometimes with the lips. The eyes close more and suggest lust. The lips protrude oh so slightly  as if about to kiss, but the head comes back to its normal position like a wave returning to the sea. The 'friendly' Nod has become what was once the recognition smile, the one where we bare no teeth but still maintain the same basic facial structure.  What will come next I wonder, how long will The Nod live? Will there be The Eyebrow Lift? The Wink? Or will we go back in our greeting fashion and return to shaking hands?
