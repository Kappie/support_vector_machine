Yes, it's true, you can at last get a tuxedo for your cell phone. The  urlLink Bytech Tux Shuttle  is a black rubber case with leather and metal trim that should go beautifully with your own formal wear. The Shuttle clip releases at the touch of a button should you decide to wear your now "elegant" accessory on your belt.
