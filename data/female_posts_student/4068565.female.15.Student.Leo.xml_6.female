They said it...Grandpa has brain cancer. *sigh* Its been really hard around here lately...and theres only one person I can talk to...and I cant. Today I mainly sat around...here all alone...thinking about everything....about how lost I'd be....Kim came over for awhile...she cheered me up...but I still didnt have that same smile. I guess I can just keep counting the long days until Youth Council. I think its down to 37 days. *sigh* Everything is so crazy. My life. heh...what is normal anyway? This summer has not been the greatest...for anyone in my family. Grandma had a hole in her eye...she had surgery...then my Grandpa had his kidney out cuz it was cancerous...and one cell musta got lose...and its now in his brain. *sigh* I might even have to have surgery sometime within the next year...for my eye again. If I do...I want it at the end of the school year....so summer will be here and I wont have to worry bout all my school work and stuff. 2nd semester is going to be really hard...Im not gonna even try cheerleading then....I wouldnt be able to handle it....I don't know whats gonna happen even the first half...with family stuff...school and cheerleading. *sigh* I hope everything turns out okay. We started a prayer chain thru church today....mom didnt even go to work...and shes only going to go in for a little while tomorrow...and then shes gonna go back to the hospital...so I get to make supper again....only the 5th time this week. *sigh* Life is crazy isnt it? One minute everything can be great...like Tuesday night. All my plans...everything was good....Grandpa came home from the doctor and they said there was no cancer...that night was great...all smiles...no tears. Wednesday. Boom. I woke up to bad news...and I feel like Im hated. Then my Grandpa went downhil...and gosh. *sigh* I dunno what to do...Kim leaves tomorrow so Im really going to be alone....no one to talk to....no one I love atleast. Theres one person I need so much right now....cuz I need to talk and get helped through all of this....and I can't talk to that one person. *sigh* I guess I'll just sit here and...make it through. I just hope he gets through this....I just have to think positive....Cuz I know...my Grandma will be lost without him....Get better Grandpa....  -Tara    Song of the Day:  Perfect, Sara Evans  If you don't take me to Paris On a lover's getaway It's all right, it's all right If I'd rather wear your t-shirt Than a sexy negligee It's all right, it's all right Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit It's kinda nice to know that it doesn't have to be  Perfect Baby every little piece Of the puzzle doesn't always fit Perfectly love can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams But honey if it's good enough for you It's good enough for me  If your mother doesn't like The way I treat her baby boy It's all right, it's all right If in every wedding picture My daddy looks annoyed It's all right, it's all right Don't you know that all the fairy tales tell a lie Real  love  and real life doesn't have to be  Perfect Baby every little piece Of the puzzle doesn't always fit Perfectly  Love  can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams But honey if it's good enough for you It's good enough for me  You don't mind if I show up late for everything And when you lose your cool it's kinda cute to me Ain't it nice to know that we don't have to be  Perfect Baby every little piece Of the puzzle doesn't always fit Perfectly  Love  can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams But honey if it's good enough for youIt's good enough for me
