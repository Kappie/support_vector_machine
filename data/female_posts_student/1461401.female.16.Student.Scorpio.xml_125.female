       
      I should really stop this all. I should take what I can get and be thankful for it. I should stop crying over what I never had. I should stop thinking too much about a situation and just let myself be happy in the moment.  But what moment is there to be happy in?  "You were afraid of being abandoned so you abandoned them. You distanced yourself from the whole thing."  I should really stop this all. I should stop crying before I lose myself again. Because there would be no one to search for me. They've all stopped coming, and I stopped waiting, and it's all ended now.  I'm sorry.
