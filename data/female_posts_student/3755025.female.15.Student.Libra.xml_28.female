(anyone can obviously say that i had fun over the weekend!)  and i got to see my whole disfuntional family (oo fun...) and i found out my cousin is 6 months pregnant.. and shes.. i think a year and a half younger than me.. (which i think is hilarious.. because me and my dad were betting on what age she would get knocked up..{which is horrible i know..but soo much fun!} and i was closer..i guess 15..my dad guessed 17) and i won about 20 dollars! heh heh heh!  but other than the psycho freaks that are actually dangling form my lightning-struck family tree.. it was fun.  i also brought home the tent.. so over the summer theres gonna be BLASH some night!!! hahaha  mood: hyper music: devil in jersey city-coheed and cambria
