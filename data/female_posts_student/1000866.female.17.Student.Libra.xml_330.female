Do you dream or do you sleep? Do you pick and choose amongst the jewels for one to keep? Do you wish upon a star, or does everything just out of reach just seem just too far away? Nothing seems to change Let alone you wont forget my name Just dont lose what you know Just don't lose what you know When you're so far away So deep you say But, no matter where you go it all ends up the same Do you wish upon a star or does everything just out of reach seem just too far away? Nothing seems to change Let alone you wont forget my name Just don't lose what you know Just don't lose what you know When you're so far away What you lose is what you know Where you go is where you grow How near we've come is yet to show We've come so close yet so far away So far away...
