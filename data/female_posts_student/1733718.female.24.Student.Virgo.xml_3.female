Canada Day 2004 will without a doubt go down in my books as a memorable one.  Actually, the festivities started a little early this year thinking I'd take July 1st as a day off to recouperate before coming in (reluctantly) for work the next day....Uhmmmm didn't happen :P  Here's what did...  June 30: PreCanada Day BBQ Great food, Great Drinks, Great Music, Great friends!!!  And all set to a Hawaiian/Beach-type theme. Thanks to Karlo, Gerard, Laura, Don, Jen,  Rodney for coming out.  July 1st: Canada Day  Don, Jen  Rodney stayed over.  I Woke up with a mild headache (didn't drink as much as I would have liked to) but nothing that a good cup of java and a hearty filipino breakfast couldn't fix.  Jen was the first up, Don passed out (way too much to drink) and Rodney just was tired out.    Fast forwarding to some night action.... Darlene  Marcella (long time highschool gal pals) came over for some pre-drinking before we'd head down to Seven (on Adelaide and University) to meet up with Diana (another highschool bud).  On the way to, we picked up Nadine, yes another Ex-Poper like the other 3.  Needless to say, the night was truly memorable.  Pre-drinking consisted of a Sambucca shot (notice the absence of "shots", eww), Cran and Raspberry Vodka chasers, Tequila and Lemon Drop shots.  We had a nice buzz going.  Just when we thought the night couldn't get any more exciting.... my dog Tamiko managed to slip passed us through the door and bolted with the sound of the fireworks.  It took us a long and scary while for find her (shaking).  Who knew that Marcella (the sprinter), Darlene (the pick-up) and Me (the negotiator) could manage to pull this off in a semi-drunken state.  Well after this fiasco, we kinda lost our buzz (darnit all).  My sister was gracious enough to drive us downtown after what happened and we arrived at Seven just as the club was starting to get busy.  The rest of the night seems like a blur, and I'm still trying to piece most of it together....  Like I said earlier, this one is definitely "ONE FOR THE BOOKS"!!!
