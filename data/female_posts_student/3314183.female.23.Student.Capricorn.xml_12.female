You are no longer who I used to know No longer the Doppio so sweet, so real. I don't want to be your meantime girl no more.  All you ever made were empty promises Yet I chose to entrust my heart to you Now, This hurt is squirming its way into me.   If you really do like me You would have time for me You wouldn't do the MIA time and time again.  I loved you. I really did.  But you are not the one for me Neither am I for you You must be really happy now that I've decided to leave.  You are not in God's plan for my future You are in God's plan that I would learn something from this God planted you into my life because He wants me never to repeat this mistake ever again.  But know what... If I could survive what happened four months ago, I can survive this.  If God brings you to it God will bring you through it.
