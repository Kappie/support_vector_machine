A New Yorker would probably say the same thing (except for the clean part) so I guess it's your own decision.        Which is better?   New York or Chicago?       Just kidding, that's not a good question because there are so many ways that it could be swayed by different subjects.      I was on TV today. On CBS (early morning show) and Tom Cruise was the special guest ; )   But anyway--the Global Youth Leaders Convention (GYLC) was there too and they got very mad at my choir very quickly. But they had good reason too. But I'll explain more tomorrow. I'll have to post pictures of everything later. actually, I'm going to post a couple right now. but more will be coming soon
