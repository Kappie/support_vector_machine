I was physically and emotionally worn out, and the devil was throwing darts at me from all sides in my weakened condition, planting random, evil thoughts inside my head.  I got so upset that I ran downstairs, threw myself onto the bed, and started sobbing.  I didn't really have a rhyme or reason to be in such agony, but I was.  I yelled out, "Abba...my Lord Jesus!  Hold me and never let go!"    And then this vision from the Holy Spirit came into my head.  Christ was kneeling down, and he extended His outstretched hand to me.  He said, "Peace!  Peace.  Why did you dout?  Take My hand and get up."  And I got up.  And was immediately drawn to the Scripture of Peter fearing for his life on the water during a storm, which I'd actually never read before.  "Instantly Jesus reached out His hand and caught and held him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
