I gave, now im wanting something in return  so cry just a little for me.  if your love could be caged honey, I would hold the key.  and conceal it underneath  that pile of lies you handed me.  and you'd hunt and those lies  they'd be all you'd ever find.  and that'd be all you'd have to know  for me to be fine.  and you'd cry a little you'd die just a little and baby I would feel just a little less pain.  I gave now from wanting  something in return so cry just a little for me.  give it up baby I hear youre doin fine.  nothins gonna save me I see it in your eyes.  some kind of heartache  honey give it a try.  I don't want pity,  I just want what is mine
