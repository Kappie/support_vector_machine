I don't know what it is about baseball; I think it is the uniforms the guys wear that are so hot! No, no, not the little boys on Matt's team--I'm talking about like high school guys and up. Okay, nevermind, this is going nowhere... haha.   Surprise, surprise. Mom and Dad won't let me go to Dr. Feelgoods on Friday night with Morgan and Heather. Dad says anyone who wants to go there "must not have their head screwed on right," and Mom ever so kindly added that the only reason I want to go is because I am a follower; only because my friends are going, and because I don't get invited out much, I jump at any and all opportunities, regardless of their worth. Ouch, that burned. I really WANT to go, I don't feel OBLIGATED to go. Mom says that it just isn't my "scene," and I'd like to think otherwise. I am a fun and responsible teenage girl, and please don't begin to argue that teenage girls wouldn't want to go to a club to dance and meet new people...ahem... cute guys? Argh... my parents like to argue that they actually know me better than I know myself (and how many times have I heard that one?), and it just is not true at all. So I guess if, well "when" really, Heather or Morgan calls to see if I can go on Friday I will tell them I am not aloud to go to the club. I guess if they are good friends they'd be a little more flexible to where they are going that night. Friends would do that, wouldn't they? God, I hope. Mom kind of put things in perspective for me today by telling me something I've been telling myself the last couple of weeks: Let what you love go, and if it doesn't come back to you, it was never yours. I've gradually been letting Heather go, and it really doesn't look like she's coming back. It hurts, oh God it hurts so much, but I think that I am better off.   I was in awe over Mr. and Mrs. Bragga today at tennis practice; truthfully, I'm always admiring the relationship that they share, but today it was really endearing. You know, they were high school sweethearts. God, I really wish that I would meet someone new- I guess I am kind of glad that Kenny is out of my life (in and out in a snap, practically) because I don't think we were the greatest match. Indeed, I had a lot of fun with him when we were together, and I never thought this when we were around each other, but I guess I kind of saw the situation through rose-colored glasses. Who knows? I'm not living in the past anymore-- I really want to start over, and as difficult and unfeasible that is for me right now, I want to do this ever so badly.   I don't know. About what? Again, I don't know. I'm not extremely upset to the point where I cannot function. Surprisingly, I'm verging on happiness here. Yeah, crazy, huh? Well, that's me for you.
