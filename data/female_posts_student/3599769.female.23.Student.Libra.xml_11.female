Please God give us a second chance. Please God. give me a shot at this one more time. i haven't been this sad in awhile. im true-blue sad today. or country music sad. maybe its the lack of sleep too. whatever it is i hope it doesn't last. i just want to be with him. in his arms. sleeping, dreaming and smelling him when we wake up. i just want him. Please God Please God.
