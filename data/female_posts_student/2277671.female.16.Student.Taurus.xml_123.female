'` Arent u going to ask if mOnica can come over?'` and Markus was like.. no.. but she said i could, so i just went over there anyways... and we washed his moms car.. it was hella funny we kept 'accidently' getting each other wet.. n we had a nice lil day.. but today he wanted me to walk up to school to go see him after Saturday school [ yeh he got a saturday ...] But i didnt, because he was gonna go to the A's game. And we was havin a 'good time' n then sum female called him on the phone n ruined it all for the whole rest of the day.... the mood , she ruined... n we watched Honey... it was ok... i 'd never seen it..     But i always need a ride home, becuase my mom cant drive n my dad sleeps, so everytime i go over there i need a ride back home and i have to be home at 10...and usually his mom would take me home, but with his grandmother in the hospital, his mom is there with her all the time, and so his dad has to take me home, and his dad works all day, comes home n sleeps, and hes been havin to wake up to take me home.. so on the way home markus was like ' my mom said you cant come over anymore unless you get a ride home' Soooo i guess i wont be goin over his house anymore.. which is for the better...  i guess because we can never just have a nice day together anyways, and i mean that may ruin our relationship even more because once your relationship becomes dependant on something ,besides just spending time together,  its  crucial for it to stay a relationship, and actually for u to be happy.. but i donno .  we'll see how things work out?     Blogger should have a warning... '` addicting '` Its true, blogging is addicting.... Vivan left  Came back... Stina left.. and  urlLink came back .... What else is there to say.. its  healthy  for us. ?
