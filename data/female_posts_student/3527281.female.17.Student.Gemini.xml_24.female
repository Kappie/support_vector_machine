Sunday :    Okay Sunday I slept in pretty late and eventually got up and moving. I called LeeAnne to figure out what time we were going to leave and we decided we were going to leave the same time we had planned to begin with, which was 5:00 I believe. So before she came over to pick me up, I ran into to town to go to Video Update to get "Mary Poppins" since neither one of us have seen it in years. It took me like 15 minutes to find the darn movie, so after that I came home and LeeAnne was already there waiting for me. So I grabbed some last minute things, threw all my stuff in the trunk and said my goodbyes to my family and we were on our way. Well first we stopped at Hawley's to get a bag of ice for the cooler and that was when I screamed because Renee was tapping on my window and it scared me pretty bad. So after that, then we were on our way. When we got to Norwalk we stopped at a McDonald's so we could grab something to eat (burger, shake, and fries) and then we were on the road again. And after I finished eating my food we pulled over so I could drive the rest of the way.  I would like to thank my dad for his marvelous directions to get to Port Clinton. There was only one little mistake: there was no fork in the road. It's a good thing I knew where we were, having been there quite a few times, otherwise I think we'd still be driving. So we got to my grandparent's place, without getting lost even once! So we said hi to my grandparents and general talking and what not (stories of Grandpa in his youth) and we called our moms to tell them we got there safely. And then I remembered that I had forgotten my conditioner at home. So we all got in their van and went to the lovely town of Port Clinton. And like my grandpa said, if you blink, you might miss it. So we went to Kroger and I got my conditioner (and some shampoo that smells really good) and we headed back, but we ended up stopping at an ice cream place, where we met a black lab named Drew (how ironic!). Then we went back to their place andLeeAnne and I decided to go for a walk. So we walked up to the rec center area and went and sat out by the pooland just talked and of course laughed about everything.Got random calls from mom and other people. And there was a life guard there, which we found out likes Maroon 5. So yeah we stayed thereand looked at the clouds (Hey that one looks likea....wow I can't remember what the heck it is called. LeeAnne help me!!! Please tell me what it's called or I mightgo crazy.) Anyway, so after westarted getting attackedby mosquitos we decided we should head back to the place we were staying. And we weren't sure where to leave since the lifeguard had been locking all the doors and gates. So we looked helplessly around and the lifeguard came over (he was kinda cute) and said,"So have a good conversation?" And we were like, "Er, yes. We did. How do we get out?" And so he went over to one of the gates and just lifted it off the hinges and I said, "Oohhh. Now we know how to sneak in here at night." And he says, "Oh yeahbecause the fence is too high to climb over." The fences are probably up to my chest, so yeah. They're not that high.  So we got back to our place and watched"Mary Poppins." It's amazing how much stuff there is in there that you forget about. And those special effects, all I can says is.....wow. After watching the movie we eventually got to sleep.          Monday:        We wake up first around 7:00 because my grandma is clanging around in the kitchen. So we both turn over, eyes twitching most likely, and go back to sleep until my phone goes off at 8:00 and the TV turns on. I'm trying to find my phone because I'm about the throw it against the wall because I used the most annoying ringer as the alarm. So we lay there for a while not really wanting to get up. We do eventually and I eat breakfast and then take a shower, and am afterwards reminded about the limited hot water. Whoops. So LeeAnne takes a shower and I start to dry my hair, when I blow a fuse in the kitchen because of my hair drier. Whoops. LeeAnne gets out and is not feeling too well (fetal position on bed) and I finish up getting ready. We're eventually both ready around 9:30. So we get in the car to go to Cedar Point, baby!!!  We eventually get to Cedar Point (8 BUCKS FOR PARKING?!) without getting lost, I might add. And we park and basically just hop out of the car and go into the park, which we find is a major mistake later not paying attention to where we parked. So we get in finally and we're both just like "Wow..." So we go over to the massive line to get a locker so we can stash our bags in. And we get up to the cute locker guy, Lucasz (yes, the "z" was there) and we get our locker, which is conveniently on the very bottom by the ground *twitch* and we head over to the Demon Drop since we're so close to it. We wait in line for a while and we're basically bubbling with energy and excitement. So we get on the Demon Drop with two other girls about 3 or 4 years younger than us and we're freaking out more than they are. We're going up and I'm going "Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. We're going up. This is high. Oh my goodness." So we finally get to the top and it drops us. And as soon as we get to the bottom I start like dying laughing. So LeeAnne and I are laughing really hard, probably scaring the two girls next to us. After that thrilling ride we go to the Wicked Twister, probably my favorite ride. We both screamed bloddy murder I think. Then we go to the Power Tower, the up-side of course(AHHHHHHHH! Oh, there's the Lake. AHHHHHHHHHH!). After that we go to the Mantis. That is when we start to lose our energy and realize just how hot it is out. That period was probably the least we've ever talked together. It was just like, your mind has nothing going through it. Nothing. It's just static. You really don't think about anything. I mean there's the occasional, "Oh. Move up." Or, "Man, it's hot."But that's about it. Other than that, it's like a dial tone. It was also in this line though that we saw the Squat man with his hippie parents. He was really cute, blue eyes, dark curly hair. Yeah. About an hour into the line I point out how disgusting it is that everyone's crotches are on the seats of this ride, much to the disgustment (is that a word?) of LeeAnne. We finally get on the ride, and find out it was worth the wait. And my legs didn't hurt this time!! After that we decided we'll go on ONE more ride before we eat or drink anything. So we go over to the Millenium Force, which was another 2 hours. During the course of those two hours we must endure the most annoying human being on the planet standing behind us who does not cease talking through out the ENTIRE TWO HOURS! Yes, he was very annoying. LeeAnne and I were killing ourselves mentally several ways through out those hours. We also came to know TW, the Third Wheel. Yes, the well-known third wheel. When a guy and his girlfriend go somewhere, but guy's brother is drug along, he is known as the Third Wheel. We felt bad for him, especially because he was pretty cute, other than his big nose. So we finally get on the ride, and it was definitely well worth the wait. I love that ride.     After that we are so parched and hungry we shlump off towards the food. We finally get there (after I led us the wrong way) and I get a corndog (yum) and I say, "I don't care how much the pop costs, I want a LARGE." Man, that was the best Diet Pepsi I've had in my ENTIRE life! It was so good. So we sat in the shade and ate and drank our massive pops while birds flew unusually and uncomfortably close to our heads. After that we decided to go on Disaster Transport because #1) it's an indoor ride, #2) AIR CONDITIONING, and #3) we wanted to let our food settle. The coolest part was waiting in line because of all the black lights everywhere. It made my class ring glow a very bright green (CAPTAIN PLANET!). And here we also had to endure the kid behind us talking about how much better Xbox live is than PS2 online. *twitch* After that we went to the Raptor where we once again saw Squat man. When we got on we did the thing Mary Poppins does with her feet and sang "A Spoonful of Sugar" on the way up the first hill, which I'm sure was much to the annoyance of the man in our car. But it was fun anyway. We then got Dippin' Dots ice cream (The ice cream of the future *cheesy smile). After that, I think we went to the Magnum, where we met up with TW again!! The line was very short so we got up to the loading platform right away. The "lines" up there were more like organized blobs. And so we got in the same organized blob as TW and we were talking about him and how we felt bad for him. And this kid in front of us kept eavesdropping on us, so we called him Ed (EavesDropper). LeeAnne said something about TW's ankles and I said, "It's not a tumor" in my best impression of Arnold that I could. So the kid in front of us is looking at his ankles. *sigh* What a dork. We had fun on that ride. After that we went on the worst ride of the day *duhn*duhn*duhn* THE WITCH'S WHEEL!!!!!!!! *screams then vomits* Yes, it was bad. We both felt like we were going to puke after that ride. We'll stick the coasters, thanks.  After that went on the Gemini, on the red side because it had been winning all the times we watched it, but we "tied" when we went on it (I'm prety sure we lost). Then we went over to the Mean Streak. At this time we were both questioning our sanity. I mean, why go on a ride that causes physical pain? But we soon came to find out, it wasn't so bad after all. We pretty much made weird noises throughout the whole of the ride. After that we decided we wanted to go on Snake River Falls to cool off a little bit. We ended up in a log with a couple and the one guy attends OU, and he was kind enough to tell me that there are usually parties every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. *silence* Yeah. So they asked us if we'd ridden the Dragster and we told them about how on the news we saw that a cable had broken and there was metal flying everywhere and a kid was pulling shrapnel out of his face so we didn't really want to ride. And the guy goes "WHAT?!" And his girlfriend goes, "I told you it was bad." And he goes, "WE RODE THAT?!" It was quite funny. Thankfully I didn't get too wet, it might be because I kind've covered my head and ducked at the wet part. After that we took the train back around to the center of Cedar Point so we could go eat dinner. You know, I never realized the Cedar Point workers were required to wave at the people on the train. Not until we saw the cute guy waving very unenthusiastically at the train-goers. So we waved at him and I could've sworn I saw him wave with a little more gusto. After getting off we headed over to Johnny Rockets and I'm pretty sure we got the only straight server for us. *James* When we left, we left him a heart made out of ketchup. I hope he appreciated it.  After that, we went on the Wicked Twister again, and surprisingly it didn't even mess with our full stomachs. I think when I screamed this time, it was definitely a blood curdling scream. After that we went on the Raptor again. You know, right now I can't remember if we went on anything else after that before the Millenium again. Hm, oh well. We were going to go on the Power Tower again, but we decided to just go on the Millenium Force one last time. And this is when we became pediphiles. At this point in the day, we were so desparate to talk to SOMEONE, we made conversation with a kid named Jed, probably about 14 years old. But we didn't care. It was someone to talk to and he was kinda cute. If you go to Cedar Point ever, make sure you ride the Millenium Force at night. It is so awesome. So after that we walked with Jed and his friend to the middle said bye and headed off to leave.  We got all our stuff out of our locker and waited in line to get the $5 back and return the key. This is where we met Gzeorgze (yes the z's were there). I about gave him a heart attack because I dropped the key trying to give it back to him and then he tried to give me a paper back instead of my 5 bucks, jokingly of course. Yeah, he was pretty cute. So we sadly began our trudge out towards the parking lot when we realized we had no idea where we were parked. Who knew it would be hard to find a dark car at night...We eventually found it and both kissed it when we did. We left and we got back to the place, WITHOUT getting lost!! When we got back we stayed up for a while until we both pretty much were out.         Tuesday:      We slept in until 10:30ish. And when we were both awake and I tired to talk, I was quite astonished to find that I had no voice, cause: screaming. So we turned on the Price is Right at 11:00. Got dressed and everything and I blew another fuse with my hair drier. So we spent much of the morning trying to figure out where the fuse box was. I called my mom, dad, and grandma. We still couldn't figure it out. Then LeeAnne found a list of things to remember, and one was where the fuse box was. So I finally wrenched it open and we set things straight and left. We drove by the pool to see if the guy lifeguard was there, but much to our dismay, it was some girl. So we drove back in to Port Clinton to go to the beach. And yes, it is a beach because a beach by definition is: *clears throat* a level stretch of sandy shore (and I just looked that up in my    red     Webster's dictionary). We stayed there for a short while and then drove around to see if we could find a pizza hut. We couldn't. So we went back to the shops and decided to check them out. Most of them were restaurants, so we went into one store and bought a big bag of M's. Then we decided we'd head home. We stopped at the Pizza Hut in Norwalk. I don't know how we did it, but we managed to eat a large pizza. LeeAnne thought she was going to pop afterwards, but thankfully, she didn't.  When we got back into Ashland the lovely rain greeted us. We decided we didn't want to go home yet because that would mean the end of our vacation. So we stopped at Hallmark so LeeAnne could pick up her paycheck and then we headed into big bad Mansfield. We made our weekly stop at Best Buy, much to my dismay to not find Dan. Then we went to the Mall and walked around there for a while trying to find someone...anyone. After hanging out there for a while we went to the pet shop by Kohl's and played with these 3 Jack Russel terriers for a while and this cute white cat. Then we went to the dollar theatre and saw *sigh* Tommy. Man, is he gorgeous. His hair, wow. It's prettier than mine. I just wanted to touch it. And his perfectly chiseled features. Yeah. He's definitely a looker. Anyway, we saw "The Day After Tomorrow" and we were quite glad we only paid 75 cents to see it. It was bad. I mean the wolves. And then the ending. Ugh. It was bad.  After that we came back to my house and sat around telling embarassing family stories (LeeAnne is like my sister I never had, she is seriously part of the family now after hearing half of those stories). Then we watched Daredevil. And *sniff* we then parted.       Wednesday:      Wednesday, Rach took me out to my Birthday lunch at Panache Cafe in Ashland. The food was great, but the guys there were greater. They were really really really cute and really really really nice. After that we stopped in at K. Sorellas to say hi to my mom and my fellow workers. After that we stopped at my house to get a few outfits then went to the Kingwood Center to take pictures. After that Rach dropped me off and I went swimming for a while. Then Rach came back over to spend the night. We were going to go in the woods behind my house to take more pictures, but we really couldn't find an entrance to them. We got more scratched up in the weeds back there that were taller than us. Then we went swimming until around 9:45 or so. We came in, changed, and watch "John Q." After that we watched the late night shows on TV and went to bed eventually.        Thursday:     Yesterday. Rach and I were going to go back to Panache Cafe for "dessert" but we decided not to. So she went home and I met up with my parents at Buehler's for the 75 cent ice cream cones. Then I went to the bank to get some money for gas and stopped at a gas station for some much needed gas for my baby, and it was only $1.76. After that I went home. I did nothing for a while and then turned on Grease on TV while we ate dinner. And while we were cleaning up my mom and I were singing "Sandy" with John Travolta. It was fun. I left to go pick LeeAnne up @ 6:30 and we used her free movie passes to see "I, Robot" in Ashland. It turned out to be a good movie. (*sneeze* Sorry I'm allergic to bull...shtuff) We love you, Sonny! Hehe. Then we went to Dairy Queen to get ice cream. After that we sang to Greased Lightning in the car because that's all my CD player could play until the battery died. So I dropped her off and we talked for a little bit and marveled at the lightning in the sky and decided we need to do something again soon. So I came home talked on the phone for a while, and then went to bed.        Today:    Today I slept in until 11:30 to find the house empty. Dad was at work. Mom had taken the boys out. So I got on here to tell you all about my fun time and now my brother has a friend over. Oh, andI still do not have my voice back yet. Hopefully I will do something today, or I will be bored out of my mind. Maybe "Troy" is playing in Mansfield. Tommy, here we come!
