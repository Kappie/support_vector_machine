(oops. i swicthed to the second person. i tend to do that when i make bold statements i don't like admitting to myself. it's bad for my mind if i blatenly state something i'm trying to deny. plus i can always pretend it's not me i'm taking about, as can the reader. yay!-editor)  then there's the friends who call me every time they hang out even though i rarely come. they hate my "new life" and "new friends." they like the things i used to like. we do really fun things that i enjoy...and i can be totally crazy or desparingly calm. they're not shocked by anything, because they were there when i did something incredibly worse.  so what happens in the middle? for a long time i dind't think there was a middle. i mean, it's like black and white. i was the only one lingering in between...more one shade than the other, but still in between.  so what do you do when you find someone who's there with you? even understands you better than both colors put together? on to other, more concrete news: i forgot that cheers was on tonight. i was ashamed. i missed an hour of it. every friday there's a cheers marathon. and i forgot for an entire hour...one sec, boy meets world is on again.  ---half an hour later---  anyway, i was not happy with myself. i mean, it's cheers. where everybody knows your name, and they're  always  glad you came! i wish i had someplace like that other than in my basement watching cheers. and here, no one knows my name. i guess my computer does when i type in "emily" under login name. taylor used to make a joke that the choir department was like cheers, only where no one knows your name, because keller didn't know his.  oh that cory...  we got out excal dresses today. nothing short of gorgeous. gilly did such a great job of everything! i'm really proud of everyone for really working together instead of fighting over dresses. everything is going so well!  i've read johnny the homicidial maniac four times this week. i can't stop. i 'unno why. the images make me so happy. they stick with me. i can pull them out whenever i'm bored and be like "oh that Nny, killing people again...*sigh*" wacky.  i didn't really have anything interetsing to write tonight. sorry. i'm now very sleepy. the shining was good. really good. i like those kinds of movies alot. redrum...man, it's so tacky, but so good...all the blood in that hallway...and the hedgemaze? when i first saw the movie i thought that was the coolest thing evern. we used to always go into these massive hay mazes in new york (the apple orchards had free mazes, with huge walls of haystacks that we would run through while mom was paying for the apples. i miss apple orchards alot...)  i figured i shouldn't start ranting inside of parenthesis. so here i go. in New York, we went to an apple orchard every fall. you would take these huge bags into the orchard and wander. all the apples you ate while in the boundaries were free, and whatever you put in the bag was charged by the pound. each tree had a ribbon tied around it, color-coded to tell you what kind of apples were growing off its branches. my sister and i would climb up in the trees to get the best apples...  fall in general was amazing. i always get depressed around fall...everything was just so beautiful, and looking at the ugliness of colorado's autum sinks my heart. my family would drive to the vermont border and look at the trees...colorado sucks. i can't imagine why people stay here. sure the mountains are gorgeous, and there are some pretty rocks, and some great veiws, and no one is at all overweight. but none of that compares to the color.  i've been missing New York an incredible ammount as of late. i don't know why. but i need to go back soon, before i forget everything. i cried nonstop the month before we moved from our home, trying everything i could to stop my parents from forcing me to go...my best friend carl and i had this elaborate escape plan. he had moves to seattle a few years before, so we were going to run away one night and meet in between seattle and boulder, then go back to our homes in new york. all of this was to be done walking, since we were nine years old.  i tried to run away alot when i was little. i even kept a rope of tied together turtle-neck shirts in one of my drawers, just long enough for a bedroom window escape. i always had a beauty and the beast backpack all stocked up with cheese-its and oreos under my bed.  i'd like to go on, but i feel as though in this tired state i can't keep writing with this kind of grammar. rereading that last paragraph is terrible. i'm gonna go attempt to fall asleep. i can hope, can't i? i would have said i can dream, but i really can't if i don't sleep. and considering the time and my own brain, i won't be doing that any time soon.
