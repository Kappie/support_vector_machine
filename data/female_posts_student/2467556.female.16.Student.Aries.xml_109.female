But Vinny did get into a fight with Jarome Iginla and that was very exciting! He was so hott in his interview....oh man. He played it off like "oh there was alot of emotion..." but Captain Subtext would say "yeah...i just wanted to kick his ass".  hehe, good times.  No hockey night can be followed without me saying some stupid things....lol Britty knows what i'm talking about :)  Today i went to the mall with Sarah and we partied it up.  We saw Shrek 2, it was awesome.  I bought these shoes that are plastic and see through!!!  They're SO AWESOME!!!    yay for good days!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
