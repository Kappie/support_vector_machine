I was practically crying :(  School's nearly out for summer. Yay!  Still have activity day, orthodontist and pointless last day to go. And Friday.  My wrist is so thin. And painful. Come back Miss. Physiotherapist!  I am a medical miracle. I must have seen about 6 or 7 different doctors in completely different fields :P (cardiologist...paediatrician etc)  Let's talk about what doctors say(stupidly).   Are you Ok? How are you? Do you need help? Well that was a bit stupid. Don't do it again! Does it hurt? What kind of pain is it? Have you done your exercises? You big chump.   P.S  Writer has experienced all above sayings.Unfortuantely.   Got Biccit? xx
