I hardly recognized you standing there,  beside my locker, looking so fine,  remembering the times that we shared,  feeling sorry for letting you go.   A glance is all it takes to notice,  one glance is all it took and I felt,  everything that i've ever felt for you,  return in a heartbeat and a blink.   You phoned me when I least expected,  your voice brings back the memories,  equally haunting and pleasing to recall,  wondering what it would be like -  ... if maybe next time we werent caught.
