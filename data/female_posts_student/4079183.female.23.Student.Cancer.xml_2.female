It is hard not to compare her to my other daughter and what she knew at that age but I try not to as everybody learns at their own pace. I have even questioned if she is color blind, this I highly doubt but it gives you an idea of my struggle with this. Is there anybody that could give me any help with this? What should I do or try next?
