So that got the best of my curiosity and I started browsing through the male contestants just to see if they were decent looking (not looking for myself of course!!), or big geeks who like teeny-bop music too. I think it's a fair share of half and half. Then the funny part was when I realized that I actually went to high school with one of them!!!! His name is  urlLink  Jay  and I never knew him personally since he was two years older than me. He was actually in the "popular" crowd too. Seems strange when you actually see someone you semi-know in these kind of contests. It's just  so cheesy!  There's no other way to describe it! I know all you AOB folks are probably laughing your heads off too!!
