Roycie is graduating this weekend and wants me to come to his party.. but Im not going to Orlando as planned so I cant.. which is probably for the best... cuz Scott will be there... yea.. This weekend will be weird.. Summer is like in 3 days :( ... I didnt want school to end.. cuz then that just means that Im that much closer to July 25th :( and I NEVER EVER EVER EVER want that day to come..   Yea well... I got awesome news yesterday..
