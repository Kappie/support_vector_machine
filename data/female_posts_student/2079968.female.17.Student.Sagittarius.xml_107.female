I liked it there, honestly...I felt comfortable and...idk just mainly good feelings, I guess.  For those that don't know, I got an award from the college for grades, etc...I can get early acceptance, and opportunites for scholarships...sooo...yay!  But anyway...on a serious level...which the above WAS...but on a more...idk...emotional level, i guess...  Why is it that everytime you suffer physically, something happens that makes you suffer internally/emotionally...not suffer, per se...but it just sort of plagues you?  I know that we're supposed to be tested in our everyday walk, etc...but still...  I don't feel like my body can tolerate so much stress at once...vague, yes.  But all I'm saying is pray for me...that's all I know to say for now.  I don't feel like going into much detail for the moment.
