It seems like we are always doing yard work at my house, maybe it's because we have so much yard, maybe?  I don't know!  But when I was done with the yard work my dad rewarded me by taking my car for an oil change and he got my left turn signal fixed!  Aww, what a nice guy!  He makes me happy, even though he can be a real jackass at times! Then Lori came over and we sat in my room and did nothing!  I've been depressed for the last week or two so it was kind of sad!  I tried to be happy, because I wanted to be happy because Lori is an awesome person and she makes me happy, but it just didn't work!  Then we went to Dom. to get Wing sauce for my dad because he NEEDED it and Mark was almost caught stealing a box of coriciden!  I was disappointed in him because he told me that he didn't steal it, and then later on I found out that he did!  I decided that I think I don't want to do drugs anymore, because they are bad!  We went to the show at Clearwater!  I didn't really like any of the bands that played!  Self Control was ok, and the guy in the brown shirt was really cute!  But I didn't like Signal Six at all and ATR, well I love them because I love the people in it!  The only thing that made me happy was Coopers lil show at the beginning!  They played Taking Back Sunday and it just made me so happy!  Happier than I've been in a long time!  I was jumping around, and singing and it was great!  The show is exactly what I needed to boost my spirits!  All my favorite people were there ... Christian, Amanda, Lori, Hank, Bob, Evan, Ryan, Charles, and Ben!  (( Lori and Charles are going out! ))   Umm ... Jesi was talking to Amanda, and then she turned to me and said she was sorry and I said I was sorry and it made me happy because I was sick of fighting!  I really don't want people to not like me, because its not nice!  I'm not saying I want to be best friends with Jesi again, even though it would be fun, but it would be nice to talk to her because Jesi is cool and yeah, that is all I have to say! After the show we walked to Dairy Queen and I got yummie chocolate and peanut butter stuff!  And I bought Ryan and Mark ice cream, yes I know, I'm so nice!  lol  Then Nathan showed up and we talked and I told him that now that I have my car fixed I want him to hang out with me again!  And I told him that I was going to pick him up so he could come over and stuff!  I really wish people would stop writing about me in there journals!  Because I stopped righting about them (except for now, but thats because Im trying to make point!  And in my last entry I was making a reply to one of there comments asking them to stop!)  I mean to talk crap about me in your journal only shows how immature you are!  Please do us all a favor and grow up!
