So me and my dad are going to try to do it together, by ourselves. This should be fun. We got directions from like 30 service techs, so it shouldn't be too hard. However I have learned that if something can go wrong, it will. I also spent like 4 hours in a tack shop in Gainesville today. It is the cutest town and reminds me of Fairhope. I really liked it. I got new pants, and sat in like a million different saddles. We ate in a restaurant called'2dog Cafe'.The owner/chef decorated it so cool, and his wife owns an art gallery called 'The Artichoke' that was located upstairs but it just moved next door. They seem so lucky to have a situation like that, I hope when I'm older I can have a little dealio like that. I'm on my last chapter of Spanish. It is so hard. I've totally procrastinated doing my workbook, because it's so hard. Oh well I usually work better in the morning once I get to the classroom and have a table to spread out on, so maybe it will all come to me then. My final is next week, err August 9, i THINK that's next week. I have a huge problem of keeping track of time during the summer, but I guess it's good not to have to worry with such a silly thing like time. The final isn't cumulative, and I haven't decided if that's good or bad.
