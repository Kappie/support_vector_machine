The study examined three key questions: was there a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq, were weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq, and did the majority of people in other countries support our decision to invade Iraq. The study provided evidence for the answers to each of these three questions (no link/no weapons/little support). They found that 80% of people who watched Fox had one or more misperception, while 23% of PBS/NPR listeners held one or more misperception. For the other media studied, 71% of CBS viewers had one or more misperception, 61% of ABC, 55% of NBC and CNN, and 47% of people who rely on print media had one or more misperception.  Studies like this are useful in examining what media sources are the most accurate, as well as providing insights into how our political beliefs influence what we see and hear.   Fox News is getting a lot of attention right now because of a new "documentary" just released called "Outfoxed"( urlLink watch the trailer ) that claims that Fox news is unfair, unbalanced and biased. You can read reviews of the new DVD in a number of places, including  urlLink Wired magazine  and  urlLink USA Today.
