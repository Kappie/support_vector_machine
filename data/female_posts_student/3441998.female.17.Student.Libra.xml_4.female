The people who are running for office are really desport if they are outside waving signs saying " Vote for Buel" or "Kerns for President". It is enought to make you vote for them if you know what i mean.lol:D I had to vote for my best friend Chrissy for Securtary.( she was so perk during her speech)    This year they made us vote in 1st block after the video of each person speedch was over. Last year it elections was different. Each person give a speech in front of the student body during the assembly. I told Ashley G. that she should have run for President but knowing her she would be a comm one,lol. I tell you who won the elections as soon as i can. Any ways i guess i be goning now since i have some homework to do and places to be. Bye for now
