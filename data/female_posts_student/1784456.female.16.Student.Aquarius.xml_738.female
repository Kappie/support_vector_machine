I'm very happy... but tomorrow I've gotta take my cats to the vet and talk to these people I haven't really met before... yeay! Darn, my brother's on holiday. Guess we'll just have to book another vets appointment for him then! :D Oh, funniest thing in the world: (Sorry I'm wondering around, you usually have to kick me before I actually wake up and do some thing) *WHACK!* Owch, not that hard! :'(  urlLink http://clevermedia.com/arcade/pirateriddles1.html  Mmm... I've probably mentioned it before but oh well! Hey Laura go on it if you're feeling sicky and bad oh and I'm sorry that we forced you to go home, I have to tell you. It's you're smell! Joking, joking, it's cause we're worried about you and if you do have a bug you should rest! Ok... I'm scared... I'm gonna go hide and eat bananas and apples bubi! (I am a three headed monkey you know!)
