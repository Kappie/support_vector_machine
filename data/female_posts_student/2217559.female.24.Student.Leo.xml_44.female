I went to walmart, bought a DVD player for 35.00 (isn't that cheap??) and then went to THE CRYSTAL HOTEL with my canadian friends, Lisa  Kim.  We sat at this huge resort pool for like 3 hours drinking pina coladas and lounging in the pool. We played volley ball, swam, got lots of sun. It was so much fun.  This resort was crazy cool - it had huts all throughout the pool, swim up bars, chairs inside the pool, waterfalls and it was located on the beach.  We could see the mountains and the shore if we looked right. I mean the beach was right there!! It was so cool. We didn't realize we were getting tipsy until we started to leave and kept bumping into things. Those were the best pina coladas I have ever had. They came with the fruit and everything.  We sat there and pretended we were on vacation with all the rest. It was a great escape from the ship for sure.  Plus, I got to spend quality girl time with new friends. These girls are a riot. We came back to the ship at 4 and then I showered to come to my office for a few hours. But when I was sitting out at that pool, I just kept thinking, "I can't believe this is my job."  I am still in shock. I was sitting there going, "I am at a resort pool in Puerto Vallarta and a month ago I was sitting in a boring staff meeting under flourscent lights."  It just doesn't make sense. I keep waiting to wake up and this all be a dream. It's just too incredible. It doesn't seem conceivable.   Anyway, we took lots of pictures and everyone will be happy to know that I am getting close to the end of the roll. I will probably get them developed when we get back to San Diego in a few days. Then I will try to figure out how to post on this website. I am sure there is some way I can. - I just have to figure it out.   Tomorrow is a sea day so no ports and I will be very busy again. But Acapulco is on Thursday, yippee. I love traveling. It's the best feeling in the world to be somewhere new everyday.   Lots of hugs and kisses sent your way,  Shelly
