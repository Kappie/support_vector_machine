When pressed for elaboration, a strange thing came out of my mouth:  it would seem to me that instead of opposing gay marriage conservatives should support it.  Not only do I not think gay marriage is a bad thing, I actually think it is a good thing; it is something not to be opposed, but to be encouraged.  This is exactly the type of commitment that conservatives are always proposing; in fact, a lot of them support marriage incentives for the receipt of welfare benefits, which could have the effect of practically forcing people into marriage.  I think the difference is that conservatives have yet to accept homosexuality is here to stay.  Some crazy part in the back of their brain thinks that denial of this right might make it go away.  But homosexuality is a way of life that is here to stay, indeed it is a part of life that simply cannot be removed, and it seems to me that conservatives should accept this and move on.  And by moving on I mean that they should encourage marriage between homosexuals.  I'm not going to buy into the stereotype of gays being more promiscuous than straights, but if it turned out they were, who could blame them, given the fact that they are denied the most permanent and lasting form of commitment and monogamy that there is.  Sure they can still "practice" monogamy all they want, but without the protections of marriage I can simply see no incentive to do so.    Plus, it just doesn't make sense that any man and any woman can get married - and that this is something that conservatives approve of if not encourage (tracking back to the marriage incentives for welfare) - but that same level of commitment is denied to same sex couples.  Andrew Sullivan  urlLink posts a letter from a friend  (heading: Dan Gets Married) that reflects the silliness of it all very nicely:   "Sure," the license-department manager said, "If you've got $54, you can have a marriage license." ... It's not the marriage license I'd like to have, of course. But, still, let me count my blessings: I have a 10-year relationship (but not the marriage license), a house (but not the marriage license), a kid (but not the marriage license), and my boyfriend's credit-card bills (but not the marriage license). I don't know what a guy has to do around here to get the marriage license. But I guess it's some consolation that I can get a meaningless one anytime I like, just so long as I bring along a woman I don't love and my $54.   This is sheer insanity, people.  I don't expect the religious right to come to its senses anytime soon, and I don't expect they will even when it finally becomes legal, as it is bound to do.  Another thing to consider is that if they would back off, and not oppose it, and stay true to the "federalism" that the espouse, then the right to gay marriage might never be read into the Constitution's privacy protections.  But now that they are making it a national issue, and blowing it up on a bigger scale, a more liberal court might be inclined to do just that, and then the issue will go the way of abortion, when it should be left up to the states.  Ultimately, to me, it is not a constitutional battle; it is a political one.  True change should come this way; it is my view that the states should be able to come to it in their own time, and that eventually, they all will, even though it may not be in any of our lifetimes.  But if conservatives continue to make it such an issue, then my fear is that the meaning of the Constitution will be further eroded and that a right to gay marriage will be created where none exists.  And while I would not politically oppose the result, I would oppose the means.  And if that ever happens, I think the religious right will be to blame for being so vociferous and insane in the opposition.  UPDATE:  I've been giving it some thought, and I need to clarify my position on the constitutional question.  I would oppose the right to gay marriage being included in the right to privacy.  But there is another way for homosexuals to get the constitutional right to marry, and I would not (necessarily) be opposed to that route.  There is a potential Equal Protection argument to be made, and it might not even require a change in the level of scrutiny that the Court applies.  In  Lawrence v. Texas  (the sodomy case the Court decided last year), one of the rather bizarre statements the Court made was that morality could not serve as the basis for law.  This would mean that even under a rational basis test, the law would fail.  This is basically what happened in Lawrence, even though that was not an Equal Protection case.  The issue with Equal Protection there was that if the Court said the  Lawrence  law was unconstitutional because it only forbade same sex sodomy and not heterosexual sodomy (which the law in fact did), then there was the fear that states would then rewrite their laws to make them non-discriminatory on their face.  There might then be a potential problem of application, i.e. if the states had a neutral law but only enforced it against homosexual, but I think the Court would not have favored a uniform application of the law any more than an unequal one, so they went with privacy instead.  The issue of marriage does not have the same problems, as no state is likely to rewrite the laws to prevent marriage by everyone, or to enforce such a law equally should they choose to do so.  And given that the main justification for these laws is morality, the Court could say that there was no rational basis for the law, thereby still applying the lowest level of scrutiny to strike down the law.  The Court signaled in  Lawrence  that their decision would have no impact on marriage, that marriage was a different question, but with a different Court...
