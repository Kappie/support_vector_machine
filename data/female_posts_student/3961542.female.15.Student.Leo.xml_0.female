I had a 'great' time feeding chickens and tiny fluff balls that you might call rabbits, and the dreaded goats.   When you visit one of these places you dont expect to be nearly killed by a wild rampaging goat after a bag of strangly coloured animal food.   I could have died!I could have been eaten!My life was in danger!      And there seemed to be a plague of these wasp looking things called hoover flies.   Is this Bin Ladens next attemp to cause chaos ?   Lol.      I'd better go before my mind starts working overtime.      Goodbyb!             Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
