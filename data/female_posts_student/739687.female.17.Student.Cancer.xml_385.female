Bo called and woke me up at 9:30...so I got up and went over there and then decided to get donuts from Krispy Kreme...so I got donuts and went back to Bo's to eat the donuts and bam here I am. Thrilling story I must say.  Surprisingly, as I have found, this summer has not let me down.  It's been good...anti-dramatic, fun-loving, crazy...just a damn good summer.  :)  I   :)  Haha oh my oh my. My mood is just so carefree and I really really am enjoying it.  But really, this summer has definately reached my expectations...in fact...summer always seems to meet my approval. But this summer has just had more spontanaeity. You know?  Yeah. I'm rambling.  Anyways, I've got some reading to do...and then some cleaning *maybe* and then some....partying?  Yes yes...partying. As it should be.  Alright crazies. Alright.
