But just... wow. OMIGODWOW! Just absolute craziness going on right now that I cannot explain except to say I am floating on clouds for no good reason.   Why was today (except for OMIGODWOWWHATANAWESOMEDAY) so shitty? Well! ... I failed my in-class assignment (just like everyone else - except unlike everyone else, if I get below an 80% on the next test I need to get extra help :S). I didn't know there was a history quiz (I still think I passed that though...). And finally, I forgot that the good copy of our St. Donat journal was due in French today. Luckily she didn't collect them, but I was flipping out for a while.   And then I found out from S and DE that my article won't be published in the Eversley Register, because it's offensive to people who go to SAC. I mean what the fuck? It was just my opinion! Stated in a funny, entertaining way, no less! Grr. I'm mad at MD and that stupid Director of Communications. This is censorship in its purest form! We should protest.   Science got me in a better mood though; everyone was just hilarious. Despite the fact P decided to make 'someone else' not sit beside me. Which is just infuriating, because I can't tell P anything about that. Oh well. I'll live.   And then band was fun too, because M was actually there and it was just great. And then I got to hang out with 'someone else' for a little while, which was fun, because he's funny hehehehehe. :p Anyways. I've gotta run kids, people are yelling at me on MSN.
