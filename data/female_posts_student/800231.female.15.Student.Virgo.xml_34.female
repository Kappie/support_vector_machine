I destroyed nearly the entire roll of film. Out of 36 pictures I have around 5 that developed properly, life is poo. Technically this wasn't my fault, remember the guy that molested me in the film room a few weeks ago? HE DID IT! I walked in the film room today by myself for once, so happy not to have anyone one bother me. I had just pulled the end off of the film canister when someone knocked on the door. "What?" "Who's in there?" "Angela." "Oh. I'm coming in." At which point I told him to wait until my film was safely on the reel and in the container, but after several minutes of arguing, he opened the door anyway... Moron. Luckily I was standing near the back of the room and only part of my film was exposed to the amber lights in the darkroom. Bloody hell, if that wasn't enough he brought a new student who he forced to do all of his film, meanwhile molester-dude himself stood directly behind me breathing down my neck. Of course, standing in total darkness with someone breathing on me was rather creepy and distracting. I had half of my film on the reel and was hurrying to get the rest rolled when he decided to "help". In other words he took the reel and after several loud whacking noises he popped it in the container and handed it back to me. Later I discovered he had slammed the reel into one of the counters in a sad attempt to load it. When I developed it the chemicals couldn't reach the film properly and that what happened to the rest of the roll. Damn him anyway, he grabbed my ass when I was walking out of class.  Otherwise my day was it's usual weirdness. Alice skipped French class to hang out with me and Steph in Tech. Steph was being unusually rude to Alice, calling her a freak and telling her to fuck off. Alice doesn't really fit in with most of Steph's friends so she was probably just embarrassed to be seen with her. The scary part was that Alice didn't seem to mind. I guess we've both learned how to deal with Steph over the years. She's actually quite nice and lovable most days.  Anyway, I feel better now. I'm off to find food.
