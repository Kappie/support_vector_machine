I have problems sleeping (like non of you have problems) and with school starting (even though I've been an insomniac since before I was born) My mom decided I needed help. So anyways, it started with no sleeping in the day. No problem, I only sleep in the day cuz I'm bored. But it didn't work (DU) so she got me pills. They work beautifully. Unfortunately, I now have no caffeine, no sitting on bed during the day, exercise tons, no, No no, No, no. I'm kind of tired of No. Anyway, today is actually kind of good. My parents have ignored me (so like I used to, I can do what I want), I got caffeine (no non-caffeinated soda at subway), and overall a very good day. HE HA.  Now I have a problem, that I know how to fix, but don't want to. Ok there is this guy that I have liked on and off since 5th grade. He is really a nice guy. Unfortunately, in 6th grade (I liked him at this time) he asked me if I liked him. I freaked out and said no. Now I am completely 100% crushing on him (I haven't even had crushes until recently, its always been that I like the guy a lot a lot). Anyways, I think he likes me back. Actually the only doubt of that is he has always been very friend and nice, but it seems different now. So I am almost positive he won't say anything (even if I hadn't screwed up I don't know if he would). So that's my problem, considering we're pretty good friends, I can have 3 choices. 1-Flirt more, and see if he is um.... Courageous enough. 2-Tell him... Scary. Or 3- be friends and leave it at that. HMMMMMMM  So far today has been old history nothing new, but great fun anyways.
