(Although I think I'd rather be seen as Sandra Bullock than Gwyneth Paltrow.)  Anyway, we'll have to talk about the points you mentioned from Bruce Almighty next Monday when we have that film class.  I think that will be fun.  Even the stuff you wrote about Zeus and how he divided men and women was cool.  Nice egg joke, by the way!  You  crack  me up!
