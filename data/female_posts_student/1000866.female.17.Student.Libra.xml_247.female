It ended up being ok though since Kelly invited me to go out. So, I went out to dinner with Kelly, Jim, Chris, and Matthew! I hadn't seen him in so long. I was excited. :) He made this really cool thing with forks, the salt shaker, and toothpicks. It was quite neat. Anyway, after that we went over to Ranchview, and there were surprisingly a lot of people out. I wasn't expecting anyone to be there. Ah well. It was a good night.   Hmmm.....I don't know about some stuff though. I'm really confused. I don't like being confused.
