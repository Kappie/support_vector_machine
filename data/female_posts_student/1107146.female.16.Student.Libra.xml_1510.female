I'm at camp...still...the food still sucks, the worship services are still too long and we still have 4 and a half hours of free time left, during which time I plan to take a shower, sing some songs in a fictional language, raise some money for this guy who says if we raise $50, he won't shave his head (he has very nice hair) and maybe take a nap, and some other various projects.    This keyboard sucks majorly.    Well, what else have I to say?  I still have 49 minutes left on my little time card thingy for the cafe.    Tonight there is a "talent show" which, hopefully, our little group is going to perform Row, Row, Row Your Boat in Ubbi Dubbi in a round.  Thats only if Linds and Becca and I can actually get the last line up to speed, and then sing it in a round.  It should be interesting to say the least.   The speaker dude we have is a jerk.  I don't like or agree with any of his philosophies, and he talks to us like we are complete idiots who don't know what we are doing in life and all that jazz.  Yeh, so anyway, that's all I really have to say.
