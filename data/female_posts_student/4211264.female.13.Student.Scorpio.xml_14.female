I wonder if anyone reads this other than me, and Olivia. I want them to leave comments, I don't care what it's about, I really don't care, I just want freakin' comments. Right now I'm watching the movie "Hook," basically the 100th version of Peter Pan. You know that they are all the same. Always. That is one of the movies that I don't want them to ever make again. That and "The Land Before Time". My god! There is like 20 of the Land Before Time movies, and they are all the same story! I used to love those dinosaurs, until about the 4th movie. Then it just got pathetic. The worst CD remake is the "NOW thats what i call music" CD's. OH MY GOD! They are up to 16!!!! I remember when I got NOW 4, that was in 2nd grade. They've been around that long! Anyway, I have to go, because I want to go to bed now. Shee Yah.  -Sierra
