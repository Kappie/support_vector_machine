I really don't care.  haha.  Someone.... hey, that's a good nickname.... But for who I wonder????  If asking mandy, she will probably say for either robert or eric (or is it erik???  hmmm.... erik sounds... vikingish. haha) 'cause she's convinced that both of 'em has my pict beside they're beds.... whatever mandy. hahaha.  Gee, I can't believe sue missed graduation.  That's like blasphamy or something.  Or maybe not.... heh.  I mean, Vinny used to live with her (or he still does??) and she missed his graduation??? That's wrong.    Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.....  Just got back from Susanville.  I needed to buy a swim suit, but no, they had no one peices and we're not alowed to wear tankinis to camp.  Humph.  So instead I bought black capris (exactly like my tan ones but black).  I'm told they look like guy shorts, but who cares?  Not me.  :0)  They are very comfy.  But I look gothic now 'cause I'm wearing a black shirt too. hehehe.  And I bought patriotic socks for camp (the theam is red white and blue).... and I bought some hair ties 'cause clarisa keeps loosing mine....  and.... nothing else..... Except peanut m'n'm's.  They were yummy.  Clarisa tried stealing some, but I didn't let her.  She bought three mangos, and I can't eat one 'cause if I do, my mouth'll swell up and crack and go completely numb and buzz, and that wouldn't be pretty to go to camp wit.  Oh darn!!!!!!  I meant to buy flip flops!!!!!  AGH!!!!!!  oh well.  pffffft.    Let's see.... Tomorrrow is Sunday.... Clarisa is going to alisha's house... I think she's spending the night....  i'll be bored......   Heck, I am bored.  Not a soul is on good old msn.  Mandy and Ashes have abandonded me to go to kid's day.  pfffft.  heh.  Please.... someone.... sign on...   Your dying of boredome, the cold, and slugs (don't ask why) pal -  Jack da Goddess (I'm not as stuck up as some peeps might think from reading that.  It came off of an msn conversaton wit mandy.  So I don't want you guys going around saying Jack think she's a goddess, k???  good. heheh)
