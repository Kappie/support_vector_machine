AND  you gotta love our three game winning streak!!! and the fact that i started (haha so what if it was punishment to the others for not wearing their sweats... i still got to play and didn't do THAT badly.)  Actually, I kinda rocked, in the ... scaring the crap outta their point guard way of rocking.  yay yay yay.  Besides that, I'm a very confused person, and NEXT WEEK IS GONNA BE ICKYYYYY  I wish I could start this year over.  Actually, no.  Because it would probably end up bad anyways.  I just wish my mental state could start off with a clean state.  im soooo jaaaded.  *aerosmith plays in heaD*
