Man, the fact that I can say to Kevin, "the cubs lose, cubs lose," in my best Harry Caray expression, just to piss him off, is enough for me!  hahahaha  So today was semi interesting! Chilled with the Bro the majority of the day.  We went CD shopping at Target, with the youngen purchasing "the Beautiful Letdown," by Switchfoot (awesome group).  I reached for the Notebook Soundtrack.  I wanted a CD to relax to.  This music is perfect for a laid back day.  Its all instrumental music from the '40's, its pretty damn cool!  and the fact that it made me cry in the theathers, means that I can listen to it all the time.  not to cry to, but to be reminded of the freakin' awesome movie! hahaha.   Softall Game @ 6...um i definitly didnt dress for the weather!  Umm..the last time i checked it was July 7th!  I thought that sweatshirts and sweatpants were required now a year!?  But the game was awesome, spite the chilly temps!  I was 3x3, with 3 doubles!  that's freakin' awesome! And I got made fun of hardcore, as I'm rounding first and almost fell!  Blame the pants! they're a large, and when i run, they brush together and get stuck! haha, you have to see it in person!  But, none the less, I was safe!  Cause I'm soo damn quick!  Now I'm chillin' at home, waiting for Caleb to call me up to see what we're doing tonight!  I'm out!
