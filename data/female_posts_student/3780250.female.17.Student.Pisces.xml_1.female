Everyone in my family has given up on me,but my aunt.I overheard she and my mother talking I just found out my mom was going to ship me off to reform school,but my aunt told my mom she would take me and raise me. She says she can help me with my temper and to ease the pain that has been inflicted on me throughout the years. Maybe that is why I am fighting with everyone because now I know they all abandoned me,everyone but my aunt and Shanna. Hope all you guys that read my post never have to feel the pain of knowing your family could give a damn about you and I never ever want you to feel what it feels like to be rejected by your own mother. I don't know what hurts more knowing that she rejects me or the fact that she gave own on me, just like my father did!! Either way it hurts and it jsut pushes me father away. The doctors they ask me why I cut couldn't imagine could you?? Anyways I miss Shanna alot. I called her today because I needed to hear her voice and I wanted to tell her I LOVED HER, but instead I caused us to fight. I know she must be getting sick of me and me being stupid but I can't help. I dunno what to do anymore, I don't want her to be with me because all I am doing is causing her pain and she is beautiful and smart, and funny she deserves so much than a screwed up little kid that causes her pain. She has to be crazy to want to be with me. I LOEV HER though. I guess that is it. I am tired and I just want to go lay in my bed and cry.
