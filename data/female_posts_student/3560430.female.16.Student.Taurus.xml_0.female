I love martial arts it's just a matter of remembering that. People think I'm wierd becasue I like to kick and punch things for recreation (or at least my friends do) but I say, "hey I can't kick and punch people, so I'd best do it to bags." I think that that is rather sound logic. Last night I had to half teach the class. that was kind of unsettling fo rmy first night back in about two or three months. I don't like teaching right of the bat, especially since my dad runs the place and I always feel like he's I don't know kind of disappointed. I try but sometimes it just doesn't feel right. Personally I thought I dod ok, but I never know what he thinks of me when I'm on the floor with him watching. If it had to do with writing I know, stuff like that I know. But martial arts I never know.   Well I'll post later today for know I have to clean up after the Gnome.
