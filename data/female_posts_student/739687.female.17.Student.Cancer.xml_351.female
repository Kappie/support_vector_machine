True, it continues to give me insomnia, false hopes and pensive moments. But every year, it gets a little deeper. A little darker. Every year, there are a few more memories I'd like to forget. I miss being naive. Why is it that in society, being naive is looked at as being foolish, unintelligent, superficial? Being naive is a blessing. One I'm certainly not fortunate for the have. I think too much. It's taking too much energy.  Time to relax.  This life of yours, crazies, is a pensive waste.
