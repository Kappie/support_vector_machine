LIFE has been crazy.  I'm ready to just hang out with my family, play in the Gulf, and lay in the pool!  Then, when we get back, Rob and Kathy will be coming here to SA for 4th of July weekend... and it's going to be SO nice to see them again.  2 weekends in a row!  :-D  Then, I just need to get through one week of work stuff, and then I'm going to stay with Melissa for a 4 day weekend.  That'll be nice.  And then it'll only be a couple weeks before my birthday.  I still have no idea what I wanna do for my birthday... but I wanna do something.  Maybe just go to the Riverwalk or something... I dunno... we'll see.  I also want to get a weekend job after I return from Austin... if possible.  I need some extra money.  As it is, I need to borrow money from my parents to pay my August car payment b/c my hours got cut at work, due to low enrollment in training classes... and classes being cancelled.  So... yeah... lots going on.  I need to call Naomi back, too... It's hard to believe she'll be married in less than 2 months!  She called me yesterday hoping to go hang out next week, I need to call her back and hopefully schedule in some time for when I'm back from Port A. to hang out... yay!  :-)  Okay, I need to get back to packing stuff... :-)  More when I return, and probably some good pictures posted up, too...!
