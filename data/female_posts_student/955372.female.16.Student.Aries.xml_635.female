It'll be my last day of vacation besides weekend until I leave for bradford, since I'm starting working on the camp on tuesday" but NO! at ten A- EFFING- M the director calls from our library saying "hi is allie there- oh hi dear- could you come in this morning and work till about two, we're a little short handed. I hope I didn't wake you up - oh sorry dear. I feel really aweful about making you work on you're first day of vacation, especially since you worked all weekend. Ok well see you at 11" *hangs up* at which point I screamed "SON OF A BITCH" There is only one explanation for this happening... it's some kind of cruel joke that the universe is playing on me. Only possible excuse.
