I've been working constantly all day long, only stopping for a short trip up to Fond du Lac and back and then for a small lunch. We got all the fence posts in the arena, not like you really care but just listen anyway, and got them all cemented in. I almost fell over a couple times, my head still feels a little dizzy from my cold, but my nose is getting better and I haven't even really been coughing much. I think I might be losing my voice but it's summer, right? :) Bought the Trapt CD...Very depressing and inspirational, just what I need to jumpstart my writing. Like an electric shock, like every time you touch me or hold my hand...Ah but I'm babbling. I'm a little hungry, so I might get some pizza. I'll write more to you next time, forgive me. I'm tired..
