Sunday my mom and I went out to Conway, Arkansas to visit MY SCHOOOOL! aka Hendrix College.  Monday I attended the summer preview day. Let me tell you this: I have fallen in love with Hendrix College. It is absolutely definately without a doubt where I want to attend next fall. The campus itself is STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL, the academic rigor is amazing, the social activities are exciting, the students are motivated, the professors are beyond-qualified and have a genuine interest in the well-being of the students, the scenery is breathtaking, hell, even the campus' cafeteria is award-winning.  I'm going back in the fall to visit when the school is in session, sit in on a class, and spend the night on campus in the dorms.   I'm going there.   My doctor is an alumni of the school, and he offered to send a letter of recommendation. He's actually the one who brought more attention to the school as being a serious option. And I can see why he's so passionate about the place. Because it's a place to be passionate about. It's a place for passionate people. Really.  Anyways, blah blah blah I could go on forever about it really, but I'll spare you.  Yay, crazies!
