The summer has gone by really quick.I should be rested up though before school starts. That's good. I am exhausted right now. I don't know why. Not adjusted to the time change just yet..  Okay, so. July! I went to Europe! It was.. interesting. I had a good time, really I did, but I just missed home too much. First, we went to London.The flight there was just long! I read for some of the time, slept most of the time. It wasn't too long though, I'm used to long flights by now. London can be described as large and dirty. Its a really cool city though, reminds me of New York City. I did some shopping there, went to Harrod's but didn't get anything. Got Sarah some orange converse from London. We performed once there.   After London, we took a ferry and traveled to Paris. I really like Paris. I would rather live in London though, because I speak English. Paris was nice. I had already been to both of these places, so it bored me when we went on tours and such. The Louvre is ALWAYS nice though! The Louvre can never get boring. We had a concert in the Luxembourg Gardens there. It was nice.  After England and France, we traveled to Switzerland. Switzerland is absolutely beautiful. I really enjoyed Switzerland. We stayed in a small village there that was very nice. It was my favorite out of the seven countries we went to. We stayed in Villars. We traveled to Zermatt and Montreaux as well. Everything is beautiful in Switzerland.  Austria came next. Austria just reminded me of Switzerland, therefore it became monotonous. There wasn't really anything exciting about Austria. Had once concert in Austria and one in Switzerland.   We traveled to Germany, but on the way we stopped in Leichtenstein. That was really pointless. There's nothing to do there.   Rothenburg, Germany was my second favorite place. Its just lovely!  It all became pretty much the same though. We had chicken and potatoes every night, UGH! And too much water and walking. I lost some weight though, but its pretty much all back by today, Saturday, only 2 days later. Oh well. I'm not used to it being 6:44 pm, but I'm getting there!   I'm leaving for Canada on monday!I am SOOO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Going with Sarah for a week to her lakehouse. It is going to be so much fun. I am really excited. Thrilled. Ecstatic. We will have a really great time. I guess hard work really does pay off. Huh? Who would have thought?   Sunday In The Park With George is amazing. I am THRILLED that we are doing it. And Electra will just blow people's minds. As well as Sunday In The Park With George, but that's besides the point. We're sweeping Betty Buckley's this year you guys! OH YEAH!  Ordered my books today for school. For me and my brother John it cost 1,215.00 and something cents, don't remember. That's just crazy. Oh well. I'm not paying for it but I really do feel sorry for my parents! I guess they expect it. I'll promise to use them to pay off that! haha.  I had my hair cut today. I only got a trim but did something funky with my hair color. Do you guys know what red lights are? Well, they're BRIGHT RED highlights. Any way, we dyed my hair color THAT! It looked neon red. It was almost scary! for me, which means its really scary to the average person. After that, we put a dark brown on top and now it looks really neato! I don't have any pictures of it, I'm sorry.  I'm going to go take a nap and then hopefully Sarah can come over. She's worried about the storm, but GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD I hope she comes! I miss her a LOT! I need to see her. We'll see.. Hope and Pray for me! I'm out. I might watch The Hours later. I've been wanting to see that.  *kisses* to Sarah!
