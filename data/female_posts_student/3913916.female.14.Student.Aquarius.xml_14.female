Someone so sweet,    I really want to meet    Someone who's very funny,    In times of sorrow makes me happy,    Someone so musical,    Very vocal, and lyrical.    Someone who'll make me fell loved,    Now and forever, make me beloved.    Hpe to find that "someone"    To be called "my one"    Someone I always knew,    That someone must be YOU!
