I don't want to cry and I don't want to jump for joy. I feel nothing at all, in fact. I have no interest in doing anything. I have great thoughts and ideas but I don't actually want to carry anything out. What's wrong with me? My friend seems to think it has to do with the fact that I'm not fully over R. I don't think so. I think my downward spiral to the point where I've been for the past year had a lot to do with our breakup, but he's so far beyond the reason for my feeling this way anymore. What is it? Why can't I shake it? What is wrong with me? Why am I lifeless?
