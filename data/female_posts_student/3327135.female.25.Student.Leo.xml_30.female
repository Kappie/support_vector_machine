Anyway, from what I knew, her flight arrived around 11am morning. That would mean that even if I were to know which flight she took, I would not be able to be in Changi Airport to welcome her. This is because I had to be in *** to correct my report draft. :)    Anyway, as long as Flora is still in Singapore, I might just have another chance to see her. :P  Hahahaa.. My roommate and I watched "Life In Balance" (the TVB telemovie that Flora starred in) and we just criticised the movie for more than half of it! Hahahahahah.. The storyline is so predictable. And I don't think I like the character than Flora acted as.
