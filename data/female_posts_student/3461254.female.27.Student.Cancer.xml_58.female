I don't have to do all my dishes the minute I'm finished eating.  I can be an adult with Sea Monkeys living on my kitchen windowsill.  I can remain in bed all day, except to leave when nature calls or when pizza arrives.  I will rent all the foreign films I never got a chance to see, out of the uncomfortable feeling of watching a movie alone (granted, I rarely have this feeling, but there's "Little Otik" still waiting for me...thanks Luis.)  I've also started writing with full force.  According to  urlLink Jennifer Weiner , one of my all-time favorite authors, she has it all worked out: basically in order to write a kick-ass novel, one needs to have the following:  1. The Unhappy Childhood.  2. The Miserable Love Life.  3. Major in Liberal Arts (but not necessarily creative writing.)  4. Get a Job (not an MFA.)  5. Write to Please Yourself.  6. Get a Dog.  7. Get Published.  8. Find an Agent.  9. Be a Smart Consumer.  10. Read.  I have 6 out of 10.  Not too shabby.  Maybe the turtle and the Sea Monkeys combined can assume the amount of responsibility a puppy requires?  Probably not.
