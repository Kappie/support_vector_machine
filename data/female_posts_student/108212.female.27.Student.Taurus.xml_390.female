By the way, Nokee will be studying here this coming school year and the tuition fee for Nursery is PHP70,000.      PIA:  If you are already sure that you and Jeff arent comin home this July. I suggest you tell Cel coz she doesn't want to look for a stable job yet. She wants to get a job to save money then resign when you get here. She has a lot of plans already. I'm dissapointed but its okay, though. You can come home anytime you like this year but my best friend's wedding is only once. You better opt to attend Ching's wedding than come home. I envy the people who will witness Ching's wedding. That is gonna be the happiest day of her life and I am hoping I can be a part of it.
