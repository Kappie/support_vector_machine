Then it's time for you to understand: I'm the owner of my life And there you will never stand  You deceived me once When I was weak Took my pride away In just a week  Now that I'm strong, Try that again I'll rip you off And the others all along  Deep impact With a subsonic pain That's what I have to offer If you step on my way again  LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!
