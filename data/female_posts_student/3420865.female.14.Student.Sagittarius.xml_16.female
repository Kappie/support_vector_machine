(this was at like 10:00... it was sweet). then we watched  blind date , and we waited for erin's sister to come pick her up. and here i am.  so plans for tomorrow=going to lana's house. (hopefully.) she got her pictures from her party developed already.. i can't wait to see them.  ack so july 1: me, lana, erin, and bunch of other people are going to the canada day celebrations... i hope it will be sweet...and if it isn't? who cares.  wheew ok so i'm bored. no one's on msn... cuz you guys suck.  for the record: mike chaulk and erin tusa rock at writing poems... i wish i had as much talent as them. seriously... you guys should do it for a living.  k, so i need a new hair cut/style. suggestions?   it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:  what is up my home dog?  And we'll take a ride, in my car filled with knives, into the red sunset we'll go... with no seatbelts on says:  nothing my home iguana   sofija says:  NOW I GET IT!!!!! DQ=Dairy Queen= the queen of dairy.. like... milk stuff, and ice cream  sofija says:  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  sofija says:  i thought it was just a random name someone thought of.  wow. i really  do  suck at this blogging thing... so i'm out.  i know you well enough to know, you never loved me.  kayte.  p.s. since i'm so cool/my blog was short, i shall write out the lyrics to a song. and go.   you kiss your life goodbye, like lovers in the night. returning home alone, as if you suffered a heart attack. and under the weight of the world that nearly broke your back- it was written on your face... i could see it in your face. congratulations. today is another day. it's coming crashing down to break you again. congratulations. you can change. sometimes, when lying on your back, you learn to breathe again. black out your bitterness- forget your jaded bliss. your shadow falls on me... you blame it all on a mutiny. when everybody around you always seem so free- i can see it in your eyes... it's burning in your eyes. congratulations. today is another day. it's coming crashing down to break you again. congratulations. you can change. sometimes, when lying on your back, you learn to breathe again. nothing left to lose- there's nothing left to lose. congratulations. today is another day. it's coming crashing down to break you again. congratulations. you can change. sometimes, when lying on your back, you learn to breathe again. there's nothing left to lose.    congratulations , the juliana theory.
