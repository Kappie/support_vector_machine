I really liked it, and I recognized some of his songs. I've beenlooking at the lyrics a bunch on the internet.   Mah Jongg was a bunch of fun! Haley (my sis) wonon a closed hand!!! (just know that a closed hand is very good) Also, the news filmed it, and......... MY HAND WAS ON THE NEWS!!!!! lol! But it's true! It was a ton of fun!  When we were at Chocolate Camp one night, we watched a movie: Fiddler On The Roof. It was really good! It was so sad and funny at the same time! The music was great too! I love old musicals! They're so good!  Okay, well I just got home today, and I'm really tired, so I'll write more later!  Hugs and kisses!
