So, there's three excellent things that are making me laugh.   First, as some of you may not know, my mom has pinkeye, which is awesome for me.  Other than the fact that she has to throw away all my makeup (which sux), there isn't really a downside for me.  She picked me up today, then we went to Mickey D's and got ice cream (I'll prolly be at the gym for awhile tonite workin off that one).  She was talkin to my grandfather today (Papa...don't tell me u call urs grandfather, cause if u say u do ur a freakin liar), and he believes in some offbeat old people things; for example, he believes George Washington died not of pneumonia, but of syphillis.  So my mom wanted to hear his theory on pinkeye, and he said that you can give it to ppl by looking at them.  Wow, if I had pinkeye and I could give it to anyone by looking at them, then I could be some kind of superhero! The second - I borrowed the Carver yearbook for sixth grade, and sum ppl look so different!  Some ppl have rele slimmed down, and I was so surprised at how many ppl wore glasses!  There's sum ppl who braces and glasses did them good!  I believe that the purpose of middle school is to hide the ugly period between childhood cuteness and high school hot.  Some people were already cute tho in middle school so it kinda disproves my theory, especially the cute ones that got ugly. Well I gotta go to Ukrops to help Ashley pick out a cake, so I'll just havta leave u in suspense about one of the funniest things I've ever heard.  I promise i'll actually add on this time (i was too tired last nite...my sister didn't get offline till 11). Alrite I'm back from Ukrops.  Ashley and I felt rele stupid cause we didn't bring our Ukrops cards and then one of the ppl told me that u don't have to have it neway.  Oops.   Ok kids, I'm gonna tell u this once - don't believe everything u hear.  Apparently, according to the rumor mill that my chem class told me about (I learn the most interesting things from those ppl), me and alex went on a date together over the weekend to the movies, and afterwards we kissed.  Uh yeah right!  I think that's hilarious that someone would actually BELIEVE that (sorry Jasmine D., Katie J., Shawn G., Kevin H., and all the other chem ppl that believed it).  So if you've heard it, PLEASE do not come up to me and ask me if he's a good kisser, cause I don't know and frankly don't want to find out.  Five ppl have already asked me, so its getting annoying.  I'd actually like to know who started it...I know Shawn knows, but he won't tell me.  I feel sorry for the sad person who thought we were in any way attracted to each other.  To review and clarify - numero uno: I have never been on a date w/ alex, and don't plan to anytime soon.  Numero dos: I have absolutely no feelings for my "supposed" date...which did not happen.  Numero tres: I have no idea if he's a good kisser, so quit asking me! Well my mascara's smearing from rubbing my eyes (the pollen's killin me), so I'll keep it to these three.  Later.
