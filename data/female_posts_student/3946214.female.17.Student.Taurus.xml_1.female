It was certainly something to celebrate about-- until later that afternoon.        I really don't know what "ignited" the feeling. But I felt so nostalgic and heartbroken. I guess I started to reminisce about 4th year again. I really miss him a lot. And, I guess, no matter what I do now, there's no way I'm going to see him anymore. Then again, there wasn't even any hope anyway. And so why do I still keep daydreaming like this?         It's so pointless, and yet it persists.   I have never felt this way before, and this must be the hardest person I had to get over since I was in elementary. Yup, until now... it's still there. And how could it not be? Though I try to forget, there are so many things that remind me about him each and every day. Why did it have to happen that way? Everywhere I look, there are couples happily holding hands. Oftentimes, they're even right in front of me. Plus, everyone seems to have that special someone. It's like I'm the only one who doesn't. Okay, don't get the impression that I just want to have that "significant other" for the sake of going with the "fad"... I'm not that shallow!!!         Sometimes I get by going home by myself. Sometimes I even think that it's going to be all fine that I go through this stage all alone... and by that, I mean finishing college. I know I don't need a significant other just to get me inspired and to finish my studies. I know that I have enough wit to get me through the day...        but there are times that I just wish I didn't have to walk alone. That I could go on, knowing that there was someone special who was thinking of me as much as I thought of him. And also, that there was someone who I could call my own... sounds possessive, but that's the way I see it.        Of course, the question of time and loyalty comes into the picture. Also, the idea of priorities changing bothers me right after the illusive daydream. But then again, love entails a major change in the way you see life. Maybe not that BIG a difference... but everything seems worthwhile when you're in love. No matter what hardship you go through, just thinking of that special person makes you want to do your best, to prove that you can make it and tobe able to see andbe withhim/her again. They may say that love follows the same pattern as irrationality- but love would not be love if it entailed practicality.        How could such a feeling come into existence through mankind? Why is it that even though we can't really grasp the true meaning of love, everyone seems to have a clear meaning of it and everyone wants to experience it? Sure, there may be the different degrees of love. It's understood though that the most complicated one would be the eros... and the most faithful and pure degree would be the agape. Each degree varies from the way we look at it to the way we relate to it. At this point, it just complicates the meaning of love even more.        Some people confuse love with lust... some others confuse it with the utilitarian aspect... in the vastness of the meaning of love, what chance is there that you would know if you were feeling the real thing? How would you know if the person you loved was "the one"? And why does it always hurt when you remember those past experiences of being put down? Why does it always make your heart ache and your eyes sting? Why does it always fog your mind and distort your judgment? Why is something as "impractical" as love something somuch patronized and searched-for by so many people?        So many questions confuse my barely-capable mind. I know that some of the questions may sound like I wasn't even human at all. But believe me, I am... and I have loved a significant number of people-- all of which ended in silent mourning. But, there is no use in crying over what has happened. But there is that aspect that does keep on bothering me- why did it even happen? It may be that I have an inferiority complex of some sort (I hope I don't) but sometimes I really wonder why they all smirked at me like that... why the idea of me even liking them made their skin crawl. Do I look like someone incapable of loving? Or is my physical appearance just "not their expectation"? Why must it always be based on the physical? I mean, sure, you have to be picky... but that doesn't mean that you have to be mean to the person. The person likes you, feel flattered. Leave it there if you're not interested, right? You don't have to make them feel like a pile of crud. (there goes the euphemism)        Before this entry becomes too long, I just want to say that...        I can't stop loving you....TT__TT ... wherever you are...
