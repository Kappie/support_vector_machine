The other day I was taking my dad's clothes to the dry cleaners and I was crossing the road...right next to me there was a mother and her son.  He had to be about 5 or 6 and as they were crossing the road she told her son, "Now, you have to hold my hand when we cross." And the little kid throws a fit. He did NOT want to hold her hand.  It was so weird because here I was almost 18 and   I   could cross the road by myself without having to hold anyone's hand.  But at one point, I was like the little kid...having to hold my mom's hand whenever I cross the road.  It was just so weird to think of that in a different perspective.  Soon that mother will have to let go and let that kid cross the road by himself one day, as I was.  It's just so crazy.  How does it happen so fast?  Where is that fine line where you stop holding on to your mother's hand to cross the road?  There were two kids at the mall...one dressed as spider man and the other as bat man and they're running around, because they're kids it's okay...but if I did that...I would probably be taken up by the police.  When did this happen?  When did we grow up?  It must be so weird for parents to see their children grow up in front of their very eyes.  It's amazing. It boggles my mind.
