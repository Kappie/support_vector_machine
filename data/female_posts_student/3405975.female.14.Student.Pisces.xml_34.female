Well, for the "unlike a certain SOMEONE" comment, I prefer if people mention me using my name. Hey, I'm mentioned in that comment so at least I have to right to say that rite?! It's me u r talking about. What's more, if she wanted to watch the moive, den OF COURSE we have to have IPW everyday den till Saturday, cuz we are seriously gonna rush through. Yea, and as for the "den next week u dun go watch movie lorz", okay, it is commanding, but for god's sake  dey can SURELY watch it after ipw fin rite? It's not as though we have much time for our ipw that we can spare to watch a moive... WADEVA...I said I'm not gonna be mad...breathe in breathe out...  AsT  - No Quote -
