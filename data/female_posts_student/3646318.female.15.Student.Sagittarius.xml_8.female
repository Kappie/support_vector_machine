I mean he seemed kinda nervous and I don’t know why. And I don’t think he was trying to, but he was like real speedy like  I don’t care take off my shirt, I like what I look like and I‘m comfortable with it, but I don’t know…it didn’t really feel like that should have gone down today. You know? *sigh* As for the kiss, um….I don’t know. A kiss isn’t fast and I didn’t really mind that, but once again he seemed nervous or too quick about it. It’s a kiss not a race. But it was cool chilling with him…lol. Although I think I should keep my shirt on next time. As for my babe, I still love him and all, but you can not blame me for getting a little bored after so long! I really like Froggie, he’s a cool friend, and nice, but I dunno…it sort of felt weird. I’m not sure how to explain it. Plus, I don’t even know what this means between us...you know? Like  does it mean he likes me?Or does it mean that he wants...like..I don’t know a relationship ( I doubt THAT’S gonna happen b/c I aint dumping my Steven yet. I aint ready to…)Does it mean he just wants to keep it on the Down low and mess around ( which is totally fine with me and all) I still like chilling with him tho.  It’s just all. I dunoo man So I dunno. Time shall tell, huh? Lol. Okay… Peace.
