Summer is just about over for me.. :( I would have to say that this summer has been THE best summer ever. I really don't know why it has been great because nothing special has happened... I'm sad, but I don't mind starting school because it's my senior year! I had a pretty shitty year last year, so it's only fair for me to have an awesome time while I'm a senior, right? So about that Nick boy...Well, we just didn't have that "connection", so I called him last night and told him what was up. I felt bad because he's a really sweet guy and I didn't want to hurt his feelings, but he seems okay with it. So it's all good. Then there's Stuart. Now there's a funny kid. He goes to the same school as Nick and is even sorta friends with him. But that doesn't matter now does it? I think I'm starting to like him. The other night we talked till like 5 a.m., and I'm not even exaggerating... So we'll see how that goes...
