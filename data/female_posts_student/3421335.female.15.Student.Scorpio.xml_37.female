I mean, I understand her, as if I haven't been through this kinda shit before  I think almost every girl has...  At that moment I want to tell her what I think, what I feel, but I don't seem to be able to.  That's strange. What do yo mean?  I mean, I can't tell her what's in my mind. I wish that she could go inside my memories and understand better from there.  (Laughs)  Don't laugh. It always had been that way.  You're a weird person.  Yes, I know. Thank you. But then, talking to her brings back memories. I hate those.  People treasure their memories, but you hate them.  (Long silence) Yes.  Everything hurts. It's inevitable.   As if I don't know that already.   Cool down. Don't get so mad.   I'm trying not to. I'm tempremental these days. Stressed...  Ah...then you should go and rest...  (Feeling defeated) Yeah, I guess so. Sleep is what I need...  Sleep...forget about everything  (Dreamy mode) Everything hurts...
