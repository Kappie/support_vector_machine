It felt odd for there to be such a violent storm at 10 in the morning.  It felt like the kind of disturbance that should wake you at three or four in the morning and spook the crap out of you.  Yet, it was also oddly comforting.  To know that there was something else that felt like I did.  To know that there was someone else under the same tortured sky that felt like I did.  Even now, when my own emotions have reached the point of numbness, I can feel him, I can feel his hurt.  I can't tell if it's a connection, or if it's an echo of the pain we felt in this room, just last night.  After the storm, during it, probably, I fell asleep until a quarter to four in the afternoon.  I awoke feeling dazed, stunned, beaten.  Feeling like I'd been heavily sedated, then abused.  And then the pain intensified by 1000x when I remembered.  I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror.  I didn't get into my PJs last night.  After I watched Brent pull away from my house, I went straight to my room, shut and locked the door behind me.  I just took off my jeans and bra and got into bed.  I could still smell him on my hands and my clothes and I couldn't bear to lose that smell to foreign PJs or a handwashing.  Because it's the nearest thing to him I had left.  My heart heaves a heavy pang: I don't even have a picture of him from the last six months...  In the mirror across from my bed, I can see I've still got puffy eyes and my face is blotchy but pale.  My hair is curled in the places where the tears wet it.  His and mine.  I try only to look at the mirror because it doesn't reflect much other than me, and everywhere else there is just too much of him.  HIs pictures taped to my dresser mirror, other people-less pictures that I took while we were together--Rattlesnake, Hilton Falls, Newfoundland.  The worst is the picture of us at the winter semi-formal.  The worst is the picture of us from our first Valentine's Day.  The worst is the picture of up taped onto the tupperware that holds the sand from our first Sauble trip.    That fucking bitch who gave birth to me didn't waste a moment.  As soon as she heard me out of bed, brushing my teeth and washing my face, she came up after me.  "So." "Mom, if you've come up here to say something abrasive I don't want to hear it." "No, Sweetie.  I didn't come up here to say anything abrasive."   Really?  Then what's that vindictive tone doing in your voice?   "So what happened?  Did you two break up?" "Yes." "On your behest or his?"   Oh great, a triple-word score.  Now I know I'm in for it.  "He decided.  He said that he needs to grow up.  He needs to learn how to be a man.  He needs to stop looking to me to provide reassurance and happiness, he needs to learn how to find it himself." "Well don't bother being sad about it.  You orchestrated this.  You gave him no choice.  You were too much of a chickenshit, you didn't have the guts to say to him 'we need to take a break for six months, maybe a year.'  Oh no, you just forced him to say it first."   Fuck Mom, what do you want from me?  "Fine Mom.  Yeah, it's not unreasonable, and it's not a surprise.  It's just that I'm really going to miss him.  He was right, it was the right choice to make.  And I didn't force him to do it.  He wouldn't have said all that or done that if he hadn't given it a lot of thought."  And I guess that's true.  But is Mom right?  Did I force him to make that decision?  Fuck, what have I done?  I was absolutely overcome with sadness on Saturday night.  On Saturday afternoon, I called Brent at home from work.  When the topic of our plans for Saturday night to "talk" came up, I asked: "Is this going to be a good talk, or a bad talk?"  Silence, terrifying silence.  "OK, I guess it's going to be a bad talk?" "Yeah," he said.  "I don't think it's going to be a very good talk."   Oh, fuck.   And after that, it was just pure dread.  I shaved my legs in the shower.  I half-wondered why, did I really think it was going to come in handy tonight?  I cut myself really badly on my knee.  It bled like a war-wound, even after I got out of the shower.  It bled through the band-aid I put on it.  Brent showed up when I was half-way through drying my hair.  His eyes were wild, his jaw set, and he was chewing his gum like it owed him a hundred bucks.   "Sorry,"  I said.  "I'm just running a bit late." He glared at me.  "It's ok, just keep going."  Then he jumped into the bathroom.  In the reflection I saw him blot his eyes against some Kleenex.  Oh shit.  When he came back into the vanity he was a little more composed, but still noticeably upset.  I dried my hair, then we just stood in the vanity, staring at each other in the glaring hot lights of my Mom's vanity mirror.  The chins wobbled and the tears rolled down both of our cheeks before either of us had really said a word.  My sister barging in suddenly encouraged us to move this tearful stand-off into the privacy of my bedroom.  My very messy bedroom.  And he broke into a fit of crying and sobbing and told me how he had come to this painful decision.  That we need to take an extended break.  That we need to break it off.  He said that he had enjoyed hanging out with his buddies these past weeks, but that the whole time there was this terrible pain in his heart and a nagging curiosity about what I was doing.  He said that he couldn't bear that anymore, that things needed to change, and that we need to take some time apart from each other.  In one of our first conversations after that Sunday I left, he told me that he defined himself in terms of us.  His talk last night reflected that.  He said that every decision he made he made for us, not necessarily for him.  He thought about all the things that he lost out on, the things he didn't get to experience because of choosing us.  Nothing that would make or break someone's life, no, but things that just needed to be experienced in life.  Things that were unfairly missed if it was because of someone else taking up too much of your time.  He thought that if he could just get some distance, he could start figuring out who he is.  Then came the talk about us.  About how I'm the most amazing girl he's ever known, about how he loves me so much, and that this is so painful.  And he was telling the truth.  I know he loves me, but I'm not sure if he truly is making this decision for himself or if it's for me.  He said that he understood how I must have felt when I was considering going overseas to teach English.  The heart-wrenching struggle between choosing something for yourself or choosing something for someone else.  He also said that when I told him, he gave serious thought to taking the money he would have used for his motorcyle and buying a ring instead.  He thought he was going to propose to me.  But he said that that would have been unfair, that it would have unfairly held me here.  It's true, although it breaks my heart now to hear it.  That he would have asked me to marry him, not only because he loved me, but also very much because he wanted to keep me from leaving.  We have talked about marriage so many times, and I never thought of it as something that would trap me.  This makes me really sad.  Every now and then, I get this horrible panicked feeling.  Mostly, I feel numb, but every now and then, this panic sets upon me.  LIke it is right now.  I went for a very long drive with my sister today.  I needed to be with someone who would be okay with just listening to me talk, not telling me that I am the architect of my own misfortune.  And all of my favorite places to drive are between Oakville and Milton.  And I drove right through his neighbourhood, past his street.  I wanted so badly to drive down his street and past his house, but I also thought it would really upset me, and I had to keep it together for Alley.  And what if someone saw me.  I don't want to make this any harder for Brent.  I don't want to turn into a stalker that won't let him live with his decision.  Especially since it was a doozy.  He's going to have to be really sure that this is what he wants before he can be forced to make any new decision.  I sent him an email on Saturday, just after we had the ominous talk on the phone, while I was still at work.  It said that, whatever happened that night and whatever got said, I love him and I will always love him.  I don't know if this will end up hurting him, and I hope it doesn't.  I hope he keeps it and remembers that I do love him.  He kept begging me to forgive him, to not hate him for doing this, the whole time he explained to me his decision and his reasons.  He said that it was him, not me, in the most non-cliche way possible.   Baby, how could I be mad?  You said the words I couldn't say, you made the same kind of decision I would have, and you still love me.   That was something else--while we were trying to console each other, we kept slipping up, calling each other 'baby'.  It hurt everytime, saying it and hearing it.  I wish I could have been with him one last time.  Once we calmed down a bit, we were both so starving that we decided to leave.  After that, the protective magic was gone.  Once we sat down to eat, we got to talking, and talking just felt so comfortable, so natural.  And we started talking like we normally do, and I just couldn't help it.  I broke down, over cheeseburgers and Mcnuggets, I sobbed violently, with the heavy sadness of a condemned soul.  I through away the best thing in my life for what?  I bit of selfish overindulgence.  A relationship with someone that I know will never go anywhere near the altitude Brent and I were at.  In the most cliche way, I have lost the best thing of my life.  And I don't know it I'll ever be able to get it back.  If I tried in the next couple of weeks, maybe we could work something out.  Maybe not, it would probably too embarassing, given what he's undoubtedly told his friends.  But the longer I wait, the less likely it will be.  He said that we're going to stay friends, that we're still going to hang out.  When he left me on Saturday night, he told me he would call.  Soon.  I hope so.  A world without him will be a bleak place.  I need to know what's going on with him, and I want him to know what's going on with me.  Superficial, yet ridiculously heart-breaking: I have no camping trip at Sauble to look forward to.  We were going to go for the entire week, to our favorite place in the world, to sleep out under the stars, on top of pine cones, listening to raccoons having their way with any garbage we might have left out.  I was going to get special self-inflating mattress pads--expensive ones, I figured we had suffered long enough.  Now we're not going to get to go.  I think I may pay off my credit card a bit and book the site anyway.  If we don't end up using it, it's only a $9 cancellation fee.  And I think I'd jump at the chance to go camping with Brent.  A part of me is freaking out right now.  What the fuck am I going to do without Brent???  I mean, holy shit!!!  My boyfriend, my best-friend, my everything--GONE!  And another part of me, a more stoic part, tells me that this will be a great opportunity to get all the evil out of me, and do something really great with myself.  If we're supposed to be together, it will happen.  If not, then we would have fallen apart inevitably.  I want to drive to his house right now.  I still have a key.  I could park my car down the street a bit, creep into his house, get undressed and crawl into bed with him.  Leave with him in the morning, when he goes to work.  I miss his bed, I miss the smell of it and the feel of it--always warm.  And we just fit together so well.  The curves of our sleeping bodies mimic each other, almost literally adhere.  His smell is always so sweet and pleasant, his hands always know where to go.  There's just no one who knows me like he does.  I never need to explain to him, I never need to ask--he always knows.  Oh, what am I doing letting him go?  Fuck, is all that even totally true?  If he knows me so well, why didn't he know I had strayed?  Why didn't he know what was bothering me, why didn't he know how to fix things???  I guess he's not Superman, and maybe he's just human.  Maybe he's just struggling in this crazy world, trying to figure out who he is  where he's going, and do it with someone he loves at his side.  I know, I know for sure, that this pain is just going to be a temporary plague.  That I'm going to see Anil, or just let Brent sort of fade for a bit, and the pain is going to go away.  And I hate it.  Why couldn't I love what I had enough to protect it with my life?  Why couldn't I love him like he loved me?  Why don't I have it in me to make the commitment I thought I could?  Why can't I just act like I love him as much as I actually do???  I hate that I'm like this.  Always, eyes wandering, wondering what else? what next? who now?  All he wanted to do was love me and live happily ever after.  He didn't care before whether he ever went out with a guy friend ever.  All he said he needed was me, was that true?  Was he deceiving himself, and me too?  Has he really been only half-happy all this time, like I have?  I don't believe so.  But, I guess after all this, who am I to know?
