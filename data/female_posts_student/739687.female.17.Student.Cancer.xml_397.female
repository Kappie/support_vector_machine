Okay, so nothing too interesting going on...I have to work at 4 :( until 10 :(      But umm...I have to read ALOT today. And tomorrow.      And tomorrow I need to:      go get my nails done   go shopping   go get my shot   read some more   read more   do misc. things   sulk over the last day of summer   get my ass ready   not quite sure what else...      okay okay. You get the idea.      So why is it that the Ft. Worth Star Telegram insists that every year they absolutely MUST publish a feature story about Keller being one of the first school districts in the state to go back to school. True it does help their case that this year they're opening several new schools and have about 1,600 new students entering the district, and that we have a new superintendent...but COME ON ALREADY! Everyone has already entertained this fact about Keller's early start a dozen times...do we need it again?   Aren't there more interesting things going on in the world...in this country...in this area?...than Keller students going back to school?   I guess not. Not for Keller students anyway.      Okay, so I've entertained you all long enough. I quit.      Far and gone,crazies.
