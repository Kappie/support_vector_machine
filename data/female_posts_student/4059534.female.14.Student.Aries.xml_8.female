We did sooo well. There was a school there called Boort Secondary and when they said the name, I was thinking "where the fudge is Boort" but it's 1hours drive from Bendigo. Dad said it was near Hamilton. Which is NO WHERE near Bendigo. The one in New Zealand as well as the one in Victoria. There's was o.k but they got like every single award. It sucked there performance, no offence, the costumes were weird and there was way too many people on stage. But then again B.S.C only had 25people on stage. The best one was Tintern College there's was soooooo good, it was about Brazil and voo-doo dolls and soccer and Carnavale and stuff it was wicked. Ours was really good as well compared to other schools. I could hardly speak at the end of it from yelling out "Go Brunswick" too many times. Pacoe Girls did there's as well and I think Jenzi was there but I couldn't tell, I was too far away to see properly. It looked like her anyway. Our seat were pretty good, it would have really sucked sitting out the front because at our assembly when they performed our item I could not see anything because there were a whole lotta tall people sitting in front of me, it would have been like that sitting at the front, but where Katie and I were sitting it was kinda "tiered" seating so it didn't really matter if some-one tall sat in front of you. But overall it was FANTASTIC!!! The judges crapped on too long though after every performance, they just went on and on and on about the performances, I only listened when they were talking about Brunswick. But they should have had just one judge say what they thought instead of going through everyone, (there was 3 judges)  I am still sick and I feel like crap, Nan started crying on the phone when she found out I got into Maccy I can't believe it, why would you cry? Beats me. I've missed out on too many English lessons and I have no idea what Zoe is talking about at the hub about assignments and stuff. I have to ask her what shes talking about....
