Unrealistic, you say? Preposterous, you say? Why not at all, old chap, it just isn’t the person you think it would be. Upon vocalizing my dissatisfaction with the fact that Carter’s probably not going to take me to phantom, Elisse laughed at me and told me I was silly.  Me: “Why am I silly? I really want to go!”  Elisse: “Because I bought tickets for us a while ago, darling. I figured you would want to go…”   Kudos for Elisse! What a doll…
