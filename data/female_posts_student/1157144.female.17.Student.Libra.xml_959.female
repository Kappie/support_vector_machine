But right now Willy is over, and he's telling my parents about this other Honda Accord that their Portugese Band director is selling - it's a 92, I think, grey, excellent condition, and is going for $3000. So now they're going to look into that one too. Which means that they're definately buying one for Marisa, and then my mom is telling my dad to just buy the other one for me since I'm going to need a car...which means I might have a car soon. I feel bad since I wanted to buy my own car so they wouldn't have to spend money, but oh well, I guess. Now I need to learn how to drive...and get a permit...and then a license.
