Yes I know the whole show is a pile of crap but it's such entertaining crap at  that! Unfortunately it was one of the episodes of people over feeding their babies. I think the funniest part of the whole thing is that when they bring them out onto the stage, all 60 lbs of their 9 month old frame, they are wearing diapers. So not only are they really big but they look like little sumo wrestlers. I'd like to send these parents a newsflah while watching it. It's something I like to call "obvious". How bout you don't feed your kid steaks and 4 grilled cheese sandwiches in one sitting. Also lets not fill a baby bottle full of root beer. One of the main problems the parents have isn't the size but the fact that their child stops breathing in the middle of the night. I've said it once and I'll say it a million times more.. Even I could make a better parent then parents. I hang my head in shame knowing that this is what America is.   This reminds me of my favorite thing by the way. It's called Walmart. I know that they have been in the news lately for their sexes acts with employees but that isn't what I am talking about. My main thing with Walmart is the people who walk the aisles in it. You walk into the place and all you see is barefoot children walking over broken glass or running around screaming with a permenate kool aid mustache planted on their dirty faces. Would it kill you to rub a wet one over their faces before they get out of the car? It's like Walmart is the breading grounds of the local inbred in my town. Actually it's not MY town it's the small towns that surround my metropolis. Here's a word of advice though. Next time your kid sneezes on me I'm gonna go out to your pick up and steal your dale Earnhart bumper sticker! I'm not saying that they shouldn't be allowed to shop it's just that maybe you could clean yourself and your children up before Ma and Pa leave the house to buy food for the family hoe down. But they sure do know how to "roll back" prices eh? *thumbs up*.... *sigh* will American ever get better?
