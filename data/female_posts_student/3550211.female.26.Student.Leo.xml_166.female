I hurt deep down in the pit of my stomach, my arms and my shoulders ache to be held tight...to be told that I am really loved for what I am.  We all have times when the chill of loneliness hits. Like a knife thrust into the stomach, feelings of emptiness, insecurity, rejection and isolation can send us reeling in pain and even incapacitate us.  It is sensory deprivation, slow torture, and my soul cries out for the company of a kindred spirit, for the comfort that only a friend can give, for someone who can fill the emptiness, who can share the isolated moments of my existence.   Loneliness weakens the spirit. It consumes our strength and dims our inner flame. It tempts us to wallow in self-pity, to descend into a kind of gloomy rapture, depressed and paralyzed, yet at the same time glorying in our misery, suffering proudly in our own private hell.   Escape as from a dungeon the self-inflicted misery of self-pity.   One may respond to the feelings of loneliness in a number of ways, but basically, we will in some way try to fill the  void .   The quick-fix, buy-it-now happiness of our Prozac culture.  The pain is beyond words: I just see the years pass by in front of my eyes, and I am still  wondering and wandering .   The real culprit though is how we interpret being separated or alone. Aloneness is the riddle we must solve in order to be worthy of the companionship of others, and therein lies the central paradox of being alone - that it can either ennoble, or degrade. The essential difference between aloneness and loneliness is the anguish, the acute hunger for contact, that the lonely suffer.   Could we but consider solitude a necessary journey of discovery, a crisis that may ultimately purify and strengthen us, then we would emerge from this Dark Night of the Soul uplifted and exalted, more fully realized as a person? Once comfortable in our own company, reconciled to the austere beauty of silence, of privacy, of total self-sufficiency, only then can we travel onward and explore the horizons of interaction, of exchange, or binding with our fellow humans.   I found that I am an interesting person, I am a joy and laughter to be with, and so I don't need these false personalities to make myself attractive to others. I don't feel that I have to be like others.  I raise my hopes and expectations but then again, wham, I am slammed down again. It really hurts every time that I hit the bottom â€“ it hurts me physically, mentally, and spiritually. I begin doubting again; I loose my peace and I keep wondering and  wandering  . . .  You think you know me. But you have no idea.  I keep thinking and praying: "No, I cannot lose hope!" But let me tell you, spiritually strengthening myself at times such as these is very draining. You know what my situation reminds me of? I once saw animals that were slaughtered and hung so the blood may drain from them. I too feel like I am hung upside down, left for the blood . . . the life . . . and the spirit to drain from me. With every breath that I take, I feel my life is draining from me . . .   But I have not given up hope.
