[ciertas cosas oscuras] have put me in check, and it's ironic: washing my hands after a productive day at school I realized wow, maybe I've weathered this well, I don't have to deal with them anymore and life is still comfortable, stable--and now?  So I don't know how to put it now. I'm sure few people on this planet have the time or the patience to untangle such things, yet there shouldn't be so many strands to untangle in the first place. I would love to assume that I am the levelheaded one but I can't--what is insanity? Isn't it funny how the nature of insanity is such that those who are insane don't realize it? Could I be insane and oblivious simultaneously?  Well guess what, I'm not going to censor myself since I didn't mean for this to be some large-scale deal, only private meditations for the right people. And it's not like that now. I'm in no mood to delegate blame, but just as certain select souls (just me) were allowed to view that dear little journal, such is the nature of this. And just as I violated the sanctity of that journal, I've done it again, though this time I will say--no es culpa mia. (What's mea culpa? that's been distracting me these days)  SO HERE'S HOW IT GOES. I have no freaking idea why this is such a big deal, so here I sit, perplexed. It was a tiff over one thing I would much rather keep to myself. Please tell me I'm not crazy to want to tell someone something that would ultimately hurt myself--in more exaggerated terms, I'm sure you would think me insane (and here it pops up again) for sticking a knife through my chest just for the sake of doing it because it'll make someone else feel better. Three people know what I do not wish to ever hear again: one, because it was inevitable: the situation entails knowledge, another, because he lives in Seattle, the last, because such things slip from tongues, and his/her nature is such that a. it doesn't matter the slightest farthing to the party with the intelligence so b. it will not escape.  Do not tell me I am the only mortal with secrets. And what is a secret stripped of secrecy? It is gossip, it is scandal, it is whispering, a seed for wild speculation. Naturally, secrets remain secret to avoid other less pleasant fates.  Thought Police. The last private space is the mind, and I will not betray its inner chambers without a fight, especially when technology has yet to find a way to pry this last bit of personal property from its hiding place.  Understand this: calm down, first of all. You have no business knowing what I know, especially because it hurts me and, by programmed human instinct, I will not deliberately hurt myself. You will not be a better human knowing it, and you will not be any worse not knowing it.   So what do you do now? There is a void, but a reasonable one. There are many other voids, there is little truth to be found in every aspect of our lives. What's important is your interpretation. You can make a big deal out of this empty air and have it bother you, or you can just accept this as an inevitability--it's not like you're the only one who is left in the dark--and calmly move on. My truth, as far as I know it, is there. It happens to be twofold: I know what happened, and I choose to keep it to myself for as long as I can. So now it's your turn. What's your truth according to mine?  And don't tell me you don't have secrets.  Conversations with K yesterday: what is truth? Is life made up of little truths added together that don't make sense? Is truth perceptive? palpable? divine? And what is truth good for anyways? Why do we look for truth in every little thing we do? Why is art art, and why wouldn't it be? Who decides? What's right? What's left? Would it be fair to say that life is based on universal assumptions just to make everything easier? And something about a network of possible truths, branches infinitely stretching out, splitting into two and then four then so many more. A truth tree.  And if we are given the gift of one truth and one truth only, can we assume all else? Is existence truth enough? I don't think so.  Questions. And only comfort measures, no answers. ------------------------------------------ On a sunnier note, the entire day wasn't such an ordeal until I got home. Everything felt like summer again, I was in my flip flops and I could just feel the sun on my arms and the smell of whatever smolders in hot weather and I just thought, wow, this is Davis again.   Talking to A makes me want to talk to my parents and thank them for being less of the demanding, overbearing force I thought they were. I'm growing up, yes, and only because they're letting me. And I realize now that there is so much for me to learn even beyond what they can teach me, and such satisfaction to be found. So Dad's coming home tonight. Maybe I can give him a smile and concede that yes, he was the liberal after all.  Journalism is falling together, thank goodness. My three pages are just about done except for a few minor details, so I have a good part of tomorrow for copy editing. B gets on my nerves ("hug Greenie!") and so does J sometimes ("she curls up in that eMac box...") but I'm just so glad they're around. And Mrs. B, too. J said it was scary how B and I are so close, and I think it's funny too, but in a good way. I am so glad she is there to mentor me, and I hope I give her something of me in return (diligence? moral, intellectual development?). I don't know what I would have done if she wasn't there when I was so incredibly pissed off at Mom that I needed some other adult to talk to, if I felt lost in journalism ("uh...I don't have a front page") and if her Girl Scout cookies and chocolate didn't sustain me through the day. I think I've gone through a good majority of her Lemon Coolers.   To borrow K's phrase: happiness was mine.
