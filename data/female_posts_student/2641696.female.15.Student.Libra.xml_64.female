It is so short that from the back it is not unlikely that I could be mistaken for a scrawny boy with long-ish hair. In fact, it is so short, and I am so scrawny, that I could be mistaken for a boy with long-ish hair from the front, too, if maybe it was dark in the room and I was especially ugly that day.   But this did not come to pass easily! Nay, I had to brave many heavily-accented people, crude jokes and the possibility of being made privy to a secret that could ruin lives... or rather, marriages. See, W is my hairdresser. She is Scottish. She still speaks like a Scot. She also has pink hair, laughs a lot and is very bubbly. She also has a kid who, in her opinion, is like me -- scrawny (though he's a boy, which is worse, because scrawny girls are more acceptable than scrawny boys), nerdy and anti-social. Apparently she and me mum talk about us and laugh about how similar we are when I'm not around.   Anyway, I have enough trouble with W by herself. That Scottish brogue does not make for an easy time of it. W is constantly cracking jokes that I don't get, and so I have to smile uneasily and try to figure it out from what the normal people are saying in response. She likes to poke fun at my anti-social, nerdy, scrawny nature, y'see.   But today!! Oh, today there were 3 other customers: an Irish lady, an Irish lady and a man who wants to be the secret lover of W. The two Irish ladies had as much of an accent as W did (except theirs was Irish), and not only that, they spoke  bloody fast !! Ah couldna understan' a bluddy word theh said! Now say that 10x fast. That was approximately how they spoke. It was painful. And to top it all off, they may not have had pink hair, but they had the same tendency to poke fun at my scrawny, nerdy, anti-social nature.   Wait! I forgot the cherry. The man? Yes, well, he and W may or may not have had a few tumbles in a run-down motel. I'm pretty sure they were joking, but I don't want to be held responsible for not going to their respective spouses and laying it all out to 'em. Of course, W and the man claimed that their spouses liked to watch, but ya never know... These 4 middle-aged to elderly people were dirtier, naughtier and, from what they said, kinkier than any teenage friend of mine. They think  we're  a bad influence on their kids, jeez...   Also: I haven't started to study yet. That says it all.   Also: wee! I've gotten back into drawing anime-type stuff. Iz fun, iz fun. Unfortunately it is also keeping me from studying and playing the piano and all those wonderful things that I should be doing but am not. Fortunately, I just drew the best character I've ever drawn yet. The main problem I have with them is that I can't think of good poses; or if I do, it flies out of my head in the middle of sketching it, which leaves me hanging, which is not a good thing. I'm thinking I should get a pose book. But those are usually of nude, flabby people, so maybe not. I'm not planning on drawing a 50-year-old man's genitals any time soon, thank you very much.   Sorry for not writing yesterday, but I was excited and bored at the same time so I didn't feel like it. Actually I'm not very sorry, but whatever. Oh! My template changed back at school, when I posted during French... So I guess, technically, I did post on Friday, but not really because it was during hours that weren't supposed to count.   I just lost 3 straight games of Cheat. That is sad. I also lost twice in Chinese Checkers. This is also sad.   Gonna go downstairs and watch the hockey game. Cross your fingers for Calgary, ne?
