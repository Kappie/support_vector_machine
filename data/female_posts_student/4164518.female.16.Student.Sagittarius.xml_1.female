I've downloaded tons of stuff lately, got 15 albums the other night..saved me about Â£150.. Horrah! I'm off to London on Wednesday... Should be good, I hope so anyway.  A week and a bit not talking to Alex will be strange though.  ho hum. I'm hungry, I might abandon this in a minute and search for food. Yep, think I will, minds a bit empty at the moment anyway =)
