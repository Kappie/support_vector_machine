His first request, which I complied with somewhat hesitantly, was that he wanted to spend a day reading to me.  Now has invited me for a short vacation (all expenses paid) after my course is over.  I wasn't sure if the feelings of discomfort I experienced were due to me being hypersensitive to intentions and the desire to avoid being hurt in some unforeseen way, or if this was indeed slightly odd.  Ever-so-helpful PP chimed in.   "You do not have what might be called accessible relationship skills and thus are often uncomfortable in many relationships.  That is always a major feature for you.  It is a part of the cachet you have developed over the years.  But I also think that this man's overtures to you are unusual, and I can see why you would be somewhat uncomfortable... See what transpires."   Though I realize I have revealed very little of the whole situation here, I am still interested on any comments about whether or not this is simply odd or merely due to my hypersensitivity.  More to come...
