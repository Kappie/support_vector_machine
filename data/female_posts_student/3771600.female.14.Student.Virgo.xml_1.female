Firstly, about pre-marital sex..My parents have been pretty open about this topic, so I knew about it when I was quite young- around 7 maybe. I've been given free rein to do whatever I want with my life but anything that I do, I must accept the consequences- good or bad. In eastern culture, it is normal to be a virgin or lose your virginity only when you're married. I was brought up differently, you can have pre-marital sex BUT you must know what you are getting into and what the possible consequences are..Why does the eastern culture regard sex as a taboo?? That I don't understand. There was one columnist in the STAR newspaper who said that her child thought that if you kiss the opposite sex, you can get a baby. How ridiculous is that? I mean, I'm fine with the "don't have sex till u're married" thing but why does it have to be such a taboo until kids don't get their proper sex education? I acknowledge the fact that pre-marital sex can lead to unplanned pregnancies and other messy situations.. But why make it such a taboo? Now, about homosexuality. I have a couple of homosexual friends who tell me their problems- our society's view of them, their family's views and acceptance. They are just normal human beings who breathe, eat, and drink but they just are attracted to members of their gender. I don't see why it's so hard for people to accept them. They are just humans. And yet we treat them like outcasts. With all that said, I've got to go now..bye! p.s.: I'd really appreciate feedback! Thanks!
