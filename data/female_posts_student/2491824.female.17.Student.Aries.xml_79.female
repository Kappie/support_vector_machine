Tonight we are supposed to get snow and iceage ..supposedly starting this evening. So all after-school activites were cancelled tonight.  Know what that means? ...No rehearsal!  ..For the first time in at least a month or so I had nothing to do in the evening... Wheee!  ..Actually, it has been boring as hell, but, hey!, at least I didn't have to stay after school for three hours.
