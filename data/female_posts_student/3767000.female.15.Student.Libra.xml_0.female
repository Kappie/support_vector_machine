God i pray that i'll be able to get enough sleep and You'll bless me with strength and joy for the new day ahead!      my heart almost stopped when i saw the crowd at the notice board.. eng prelims oral results is out.. i was on the verge of tears! (well thats a bit of exaggeration..) but i was soOoOo scared!! i do not dare to look at my results of course.. jocelyn had to do it for me... ...     32/40!!!! first time in my entire life i've got an A for english!!! haha.. ya my english is that bad.. i couldn't believe it!!! i was just so excited that i couldn't stop laughing.. i couldn't stop jumping.. i couldn't stop hitting annabel!!! haha...
