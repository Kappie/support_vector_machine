But I should have won.  I have been humble long enough. I know what its like to loose.  Where are you God?  Why have you denide me of the only thing I wanted most?  I shed so many tears..I hit so many balls.  Then the whole season is over.  Just one game.  But what makes me the MOST FREAKIN MAD  Is that those other girls where the worst line callers on the stupid face of the stupid planet.  WE COULD HAVE WON.  UGH  They were like "Oh it was out"  BUT IT WASN"T  UGH  I saw it and I wa slike "I saw that ball, it was in"  "Uh. no!"  freak heads.  Then there stupid cheering section.  Which included carl click which was cool but still.  YOU DON'T CHEER AND TENNIS MATCHES.  They were so distracting.  Ugh.   I kept glaring at them an di was like can you be quite  I bet they hate  me.   But at this point I don't really care.  Our coach even talked to there coach and he was like "Ok, we will be quite" then 5 minutes later they were loud  again!!          Hmm...
