I think we should build a section just for them.  Smoking, non-smoking, emo phags.  They are (generally) fucking assholes.  And their music sucks.  I would rather hear the death rattle of my only child than listen to that shit.  I know, it takes all kinds, but...some things can't be helped. How did emo happen?  Can we go back in time to make sure it doesn't happen again?  I think it was one kid.  He got the wrong idea from hearing too much Shudder to Think and hardcore.
