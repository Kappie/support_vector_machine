First I'm trying to work out how to travel to Alton Towers, but I'm just not finding anything that does exactly what I need it to. Considering the rest of my day this was the least of my worries... Louise invited me and Lauren over, so I went and got dressed, made sure I looked decent, and then her mom comes home and tells her that actually we can't come over. So obviously I was quite dissapointed to lose an opportunity to see Chris. Right after this she asked again about going to Alton Towers tomorrow, and her mom said no. A little while after this, me and Lauren decided to go to Bearwood so I could buy Rachel a card (I already have her present) and so she could buy Rachel a present (she already has her card) as today is Rachels birthday (no she hasn't invited us to do anything... I don't think she wants to see us :(. As usual there was limited choice of cards saying 16... I thought it would be nice to get her one with people holding footballs. A boys card, but surely Rachel would be happy with this as she loves football.  While we were shopping Lauren told me how she didn't have enough money to go to Alton Towers, so I said I could lend it her, but she said she didn't want to owe me money. And then she told me how that morning her mom told her not to make plans for tomorrow as she wanted to go shopping with Lauren. Lauren hadn't even told her mom we might be going to Alton Towers!! ARGH! When we finished shopping we realised if we were quick we might see Chris after school, but then we saw the bus just slightly ahead of us... and then it zoomed off to the bus stop where Chris would've got on... so I didn't even see him in the distance, but missed him by about 2 minutes. Aftfer this I figured it might be nice to surprise Alison by meeting her after school, so I waited outside the school gates (on my own, Lauren had to go pick up her little brother from school). I was waiting half an hour and she still didn't show up, so I left. I later found out that she went to her friends house. ARGH. I went home expecting Chris to be online, he wasn't. :( He did come on a bit later though. He was being nicer than usual, so I was actually quite happy talking to him. Until Laura came online. He and Laura were talking for ages. They didn't tell me what they were talking about, but they were both too busy talking to each other to really say anything to me. It was really upsetting. I felt really left out. They only know each other because of me!!! Admittedly Laura did give me a chance today to say I didn't want her to talk to Chris... I didn't tell her that I didn't want her to though, because I know it makes me look bad. I really don't like them talking... especially on days like today when they ignore me to talk to each other more. Laura then went on to block Chris... this resulted in him talking to me again. He was all annoyed and upset, though... it seems Laura ruined his previous good mood (at this point I was thinking how this proves talking to her is bad for him). I'm worried because Laura was quite mean to him and it might have been because of me. I really really hope it wasn't, but it might have been. So at this point I could now be dissapointed that Laura made Chris in a bad mood, and dissapointed in myself in case it was my fault. And then I was dissapointed cuz Chris neva sed bye to me (when he dusn't it always gets on my nerves). Then I was dissapointed because Lauren went offline... and then finally because I found out that none of Louise's family like Spiderman... so Chris probably wouldn't want to see Spiderman 2 with me :( I've now asked Louise to see if she can come to Shell Island (there's a chance I can go, but I better not mention it to my parents today cuz the answer will dissapoint me more). I also asked if I can come over tomorrow. If I get answers to either of these requests tonight, I think I know what they'll be. Well I'm not talking to Louise much... sorta naughty of me in fact. I guess I'm not in a talkative mood. I'm feeling sad. I'm usure if it's hormones or just the dissapointment. Either way I'm not a happy bunny. Oh yeh, Louise is making her own blog so I'll have to look at that soon. Hopefully that's something to look forward to.  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx
