It's like "Jess, that B-LOG thing is a good idea!) Oh right. So I guess I just gave myself away. I finally hooked Julie up with this account - she couldn't figure it out (or it wasn't working or something). So I got it going, and Jule, you'll have to change your password or I'll be able to get in here whenever I want ;o)
