Granted, I can't really afford to be calling a number in the US just to leave audio blogs, but maybe at some point I'd find it useful for something?  Okay, maybe it's just silly.  But where is blogger getting the money to host these potentially huge blogs (media files are always big)?  I guess it's the Google connection and those silly ads at the top of the screen.  Of course, it is no doubt possible that they will start charging for blogspace soon.  I guess we'll see. So, nothing new to report.  It's slightly amusing because this week I have gotten three emails from people wishing me a happy birthday.  One didn't have access on my birthday, the other two thought my birthday was on the 5th and 6th, respectively.  That's okay, tho- I often remember only vaguely when someone's birthday is- like I knew Dave's was around mine, but I was sure it was the 4th and it was actually the 3rd.  And I have three more birthdays coming up that I need to be sure to remember.   Wow.  What a boring post.  Reflection of my life, I guess.
