Underneath the post, there is the phrase "# comments" in which # represents the number of comments that have already been submitted regarding that particular post.  Put your mouse over the "# comments" and you'll see that the phrase is a link.  Click on it.  When you do, you'll be taken to a new screen where you'll see the post, any comments already posted, and below, a link titled "Post a Comment."  Click on it.  And comment away...
