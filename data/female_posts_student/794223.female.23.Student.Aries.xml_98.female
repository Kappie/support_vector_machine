While I'm slightly bummed about the fact that I won't be using a majority of the research information that I've accumulated during the past 2 years, it's not all in vain.  After my second trip to Cuba, I experienced a wake-up call of sorts.  The origional plan for my Master's Thesis was to concentrate on the Cuban economy; once the economic embargo is lifted, how can Cuba simultaneously streamline its economy while maintaining its vast social-welfare programs?  The last time I was in Cuba, I was living with other Americans; this time was different.  I was able to see exaclty how Cubans lived, and how the government's 'socialized medicine and health care' actually functioned.  I jumped off of the socialist band wagon really fast and realized that no government is efficient enough to be in charge of everyone's health care and education--it always ends badly.  Everyone is very well educated in Cuba--nearly everyone goes to college.  And, the government does indeed pay for it.  But after becoming a doctor, lawyer, professor, or any other professional with a higher degree, how can the gov't expect you to 'give back' to society if you're only paid $10 per month?  How is it logical to expect your people to return the favor to society if they have to feed their families through rations?  All 11 million people in Cuba have a roof over their heads--no one is homeless.  But what good is that statistic if the roof is falling down or caving in due to a crappy infrastructure?  And as far as the 'fabulous' health care system in Cuba is concerned...it's not all that fabulous.  Any Cuban has free access to a doctor for as long as they live.  That doctor may write you a prescription for any medication you need.  But what good is that if you can't get the medicine because no one has it?  Cuba doesn't have the proper technology or resources to treat you to the best of its ability, even though you don't have to pay anything.  Long story short, you get what you pay for there.  So, why in my right mind (and heart) would I want to come up with some brilliant economic theory to preserve this system if the system doesn't even work?  Despite the fact that I've been told that I do have some good ideas with regard to finding the 'balance' between the U.S.'s capitalism and Cuban socialism, any theory I would have would not be plausible when trying to put it into practice.  I've decided to start working on something more enjoyable, meaningful, worthwhile, and closer to my heart: religion.  Now that I've been involved in both the African Santería and Christian communities in Cuba, I can now begin to analyze how both groups function within Cuba's socio-political framework.  I'd like to understand why, for example, the regime fully supports Santería, but vehmently works to undermine anyone professing the Christian faith.  Why are they supporting one religion over another?  Why do they seem frightened about Christian influence?  Why is the average Cuban afraid to speak their mind in their repressed society, but a Cuban Christian fears no one--even their dictator?  I want  this  to be my thesis, and dissertation.  I have the opportunity now to blend what I'm learning in both the academic and spiritual realm (praise God), and I couldn't be more excited.
