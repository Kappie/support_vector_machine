That means I am not only going to have to show up at this dinner, but I also find out that I am going to wear some crazy evening dress, because my style of dressing is unacceptable at this place.  I'll let everyone in on a little secret, I don't like dressing up for anybody. I am fine with my sweater and cargo pants. Yet I was going to be wearing some black dress that shows a little to much cleavage. I told everyone I wasn't going if I had to wear that dress, luckily my stepmother found a dress that was a little more in my taste. So now I have to go.  When I told Mute about this, all he did was start laughing, he added after the laugh "Have fun with guys staring at your boobs all night". While Jackie may not have a problem with showing a little breast, I do. This is going to be possibly the worst night of my entire life. And Mute and Jackie are getting a kick out of it. Good thing they are having fun, because next time I see them, they are going to get their asses kicked.
