It got boring at times, but they really pulled off one of the better senior days in a long time. The skit CRACKED ME UP! My favorite part was Beth playing Mr. Tappan and the whole "Snow white huskey here". OOOH TAPPAN ARE THERE REALLY SUCH THINGS AS RED HUSKIES?! Actually yes, I met Sammy's, and they were quite beautiful. Then the Moose was funny "SHAAARON"- dude I really hate Salzar. The rest of the day was good. Erica said something funny that I was going to put into my blog, but now I can't remember it. The pie toss was good. Senor was a woman and ducked his pie, I later asked him why he couldn't handle it like a real men, and he glared as if to tell me I'd be receiving an effort two. ps your kids are ugly and albino. pps I'm mean.  Nikki was drooling over him, and I go, "Nikki, you think Senor's hot, you think Hartshorne's hot, and you think Tappan's hot!" And Nikki said, "He looks good in navy!" IT WAS PRICELESS. I didn't like the finale. We pay 15 grand a year to avoid boys. So when I walk into a gym that reeks of male- I get pissed. AHAHAHA I KEED... or do I??? Do you guys remember Triumph the Insult Dog?? "I KEED I KEED!"  That night was busy consisting of hell (aka Easton), some bball, and a little Chelsea Rauck. I spent the night at Chelsea's, and it was really fun. We laughed, a lot. In the middle of the night I woke up and Chelsea was holding the alarm clock in her arms, what was up with that? The next morning we had SAT class. It wasn't as funny as it was in the summer, but it was good. We took the test today and it was really hard. This brown kid came in late and he asked for a pencil and then asked for a calculater-get it together! Each person asked what the date was, nobody knew, I chuckled.  I went to see Big Fish tonight. Libby came with me. It was funny. This women was being so obnoxious. In the part where the boy goes to see thes scary old woman, this black cat runs across the screen and she says, "Ahh a black cat!" Okay, we got then when the cat literally ran across the screen and the whole theater sounded like a giant hiss, I got it. Then we went to Max and Ermas (my second visit there this weekend). It was good. It was funny. This guy was eating with a girl, and she left for a minute when the food came. He didn't even sneak a piece of broccoli, I was impressed. But when she came back to the table, he didn't do that half stand thing every man should do for a woman. But he didn't eat when she was gone, and he gets props for that. We had a really good time, but I'm so tired I just can't write. I'm going to bed, I will be babysitting in the morning, kill me, thanks bye!
