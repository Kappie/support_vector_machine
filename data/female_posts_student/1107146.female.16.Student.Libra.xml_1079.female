I believe that may have just been a brain fart, though.  I'll see if Whit remembers his name, because it was her friend's brother.   All right, Michael is sending pictures, so I should have those soon. YAY!!!  Um, I'm trying to get Jackie on here to introduce herself, but we all know how often she shows up...In my memory, it is once, but you never know.  May be more than that.  Rosie and I went to Chik-Fil-A with Mr. Curran and Thomas (his son) today.  Lots of fun.  Also went to Cat's Music and Planet Exchange...good stuff at Cat's, not at Planet Exchange.  I do believe I could live at Cat's Music.  But they took the hippie store out.  I'm so upset!  That's where I got my Lennon shirt!  OK, I';m over, I think, but still, I liked the lady that worked in there.  Her name was like Rainbow or Sunshine or something like that.  Very cool.  Oh, well...Tomorrow is DI, so be at my house at six.  We'll do something for supper...Chinese takeout, maybe; don't really know.  We'll see when yall get here.  All right, that does it for me.
