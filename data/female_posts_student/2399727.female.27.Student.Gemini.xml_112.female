My favourite is still " urlLink miserable failure " with " urlLink weapons of mass destruction " coming in a close second.   " urlLink French military victories " is pretty funny too.  Hmm, all these people with too much time on their hands ... !    Wikpedia has an  urlLink article on Googlebombing  explaining the history of it.
