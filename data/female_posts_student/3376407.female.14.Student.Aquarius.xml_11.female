Quote:   The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge structures collapsing, have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger...None of us will ever forget this day. Yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.     Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.     America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no  one will keep that light from shining.      If I could vote, I would vote for him.  Ellie
