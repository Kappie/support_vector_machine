I think I'm just  over tired ... i don't really want to talk to anyone, so that probably makes things worse. Nobody here has asked me what's wrong though, and i'm not one to say "hey guess what i'm upset because of...." sometimes its like you have to pry it out of me. I had an okay afternoon, i went driving that was ace, but then i came home and my dad made dinner for  everyone  else  but  me. So when mum came home he gave her dinner and i was still making mine. so i watched big brother, ate alone and my IQ dropped 10 points in the process (Grettle Kiliene or however you spell it is so annoying!).   once again i'm being a drama queen but it's my blog i can write what i want :P. anyway, last night i told my dad what i got in my extension results and he was like "oh ok" in a kind of non-serious tone... and then proceeded to give me a 10 minute explanation of some parent who called him about their stupid son's woodwork project - wow some spoilt private school boy stuffed up their project. boo hoo.  argh! i just feel so mixed up at the moment! My (now non-existant) job, school - HSC!!, my family and my stupid shoulder... everything seems up in the air. i feel like crying and i don't even know why. i don't even feel like i can talk to anyone here. I'm running on the spot with school stuff. i have alot to do, but i can't be bothered tonight. I don't want to burn out, but i really can't be bothered doing anything... im not hungry buti feel lazy for doing nothing. i think i wanna run, but im too tired.  someone tell me what to do?
