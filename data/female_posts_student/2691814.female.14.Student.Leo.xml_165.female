So anyway, i guess deidra's coming to sarasota, she just e-mailed me telling her to give me my number cuz she lost it...good 'ol deidra lol. Im watching Punk'd...story of my life huh...there's nothing todo, all i do is sit and watch tv...interesting to write about..I want todo something, i've been practicing guitar alil bit, and awaiting the new season of degrassi...sigh..i like that show. but ya, and dad got a call from one of his friends...they were in a  band together 'Borderline' yup yup, my dad was in a band. I've even heard some of the songs my dad wrote and they performed...all i can say is, they're great...the kind of music i like too, anything with just acoustic is beautiful. Mom might take me to go get my hair done, its grown out, and i plan to keep my hair long. But, im just gonna get it layerd cuz of my bangs growing out. Ok..well, luvs everyone...and ya, im not feeling well, cant speek, im coughing alot and i have chain headaches..hopefully you DONT know what those are...they're very painful and hopefully u dont have to put up with them.   * Everyone  is lost, in one way or another*
