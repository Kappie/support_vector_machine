I guess that's my fault but I've promised myself that from now on if I ever find myself in a bored state I will try to do something about it rather than just complain.  I'm not saying all I did was complain in the past, but many times I often gave up with trying to figure out something to do. Anyways...  My kitten was a girl, then a boy, and now it's a girl again.  It seems to me that vets sometimes don't know what they are doing. So now it's a girl with a boy name, but that's alright, I don't mind.  I don't understand some people.  I can understand people my age not really being interested in politics and not be keeping up with everything that goes on...that's pretty much an average teenager. In my class yesterday we were talking about the terrorist attacks (seeing that it was sept. 11) and world issues like that and someone said that he hated seeing bombings and things like that going on in other countries on the news because they don't affect him, they aren't going on in our country, so why should he care, they need to take it off the news! I then asked him if he only cared about our country and if he thought that the rest of the world didn't matter, he replied with a snotty "yeah pretty much".  What a dumb ass thing to say.  It just made me mad that he has this idea that the rest of the world doesn't affect us...  Overall my day was better than yesterday, no crying :) I have these weird spazztic emotional periods... but I'm still pissed off about the play, I don't know why I just can't get over it.  I know it's a really bad thing to think but I want Brittany to mess up...and I don't mean to think like that, I don't even  like  thinking like that, I just can't help it.  She can be extremely ditzy at times and some days you just can't get her to do anything because she won't calm down...and on those days we won't get ANYTHING accomplished because she has practically the biggest role...I reeeally need to get over this.  ok...this had no organization whatsoever...  when I get my computer back I'll make this page much more attractive :)
