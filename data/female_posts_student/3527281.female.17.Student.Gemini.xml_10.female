I've been so busy lately, I haven't really had time to get back on here and inform my two whole readers (woo) of my life's events from the past 5 days or so. Well here goes!  Friday: Well for some reason, I am having a brain lapse and I can't really remember what I did all day up until the evening. Oh well. Well my mom and I were going to go clean the office we clean every weekend, but on the way we saw my brother walking on the road because he was walking the dog up the the park and so we told him we'd drive by the park to make sure my dad and brother were there because he was going to see them. And they weren't. So we picked Drew and Dakota up and we drove over to the elementary school because we figured they'd be there practicing on that field. And they weren't. SO we drove over to the high school. And.....we found them on the softball diamond. I decided I wanted to try hitting. I bet it was a sight to see: I had flip-flops on, with a skirt (below my knees, don't worry), and a tank top...Trying to hit a baseball. It's a lot different from softball. And I haven't swung a bat in about a year so that didn't help. So my dad decided he wanted to hit so I had to pitch to him. I didn't do too bad at that! =) Then I went home because I was supposed to be meeting up with people to go to the movies. It was a very confusing situation (I'm not going into details because I'm still confused about it!) but we ended up meeting at Brad's and then going into Mansfield to the new movie theatre and we met LeeAnne there. We were going to see "Dodgeball" but it was sold out. Soooo....we ended up seeing "The Chronicles of Riddick." It was an interesting movie. We got there about 10 minutes before the actual movie started so since there were 8 of us, we were stuck in the 5th row. If you see that movie, do NOT sit that close. I had a splitting head ache afterwards. But it was still fun. So I got home around 12:30 and went to bed.  Saturday: I had to wake up early because my grandma and grandpa Switzer were coming down to spend the day with us. So they got here around 10:30. My dad, brothers, and grandpa went to an air show and my mom, grandma, and I went to the Prairie Peddler Festival. It was pretty fun. I ended up buying this purse made out of Capri Sun things!! It's really cool! After spending a few hours there we went to a flower place and then back home. I slept on the way back because I was so tired from the night before. Then we all went to Pizza Hut for dinner. My grandparents then went home and we had to stop at the store to get some paint to touch up a couple spots on my car. So I got home and then mom and I went back in to Mansfield to clean the office we clean every week. When I got home I called LeeAnne to figure out what we were doing that evening and we deicided she should just come over. So she did. My parents, her, and I all started to watch "Jeepers Creepers" on TV, but we decided we wanted to watch one of our scary movies on DVD instead, so we ended up watching "Darkness Falls." We made fun of a lot of stuff. It was fun. Did you ever notice that in scary movies the people are SO INCREDIBLY STUPID?! I mean like in "Jeepers Creepers." Why would you go back to a house where you saw some evil dude tossing dead bodies into a rusty pipe?! WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO INVESTIGATE?! Honestly. Dumb people. So after that we were playing The Sims because we found some cheat codes and we made a huge house for us and everything. And then we realized that it was one in the morning, so she left.   Sunday: Was Father's Day. So when I woke up in the morning I decided I wanted to write my dad a poem to put in the card we got him. So after my creative juices were flowing I came up with this: "Today is Father's Day, And there are a few things we need to say. Thanks for being such an awesome Dad, And sticking with us through good and bad. When it comes to sports you know it all, Like when an umpire makes a bad call. Your silly jokes always make us laugh, Now let's go to the zoo and look at the giraffe! (Sorry, it was the only word that rhymed with "laugh.") Most importantly we want to thank you For being the Dad that you are and all that you do. WE LOVE YOU!" So we gave Dad his father's day gifts and then we went in to Brunswick to my grandma and grandpa Switzer's to give my grandpa his gifts. Then my brothers and I went to our friend's house there whom we've been friends with for years. So I got to see my friend Brittany. We played Trivial Pursuit out on her driveway, it was fun. Then we came home and I took my car out and drove it around for a while. And I am doing so much better, if I may say so myself. I felt good driving it that day. So then I came back home and packed up my stuff for going up to the lake and went to bed.   Monday: We left the house around 11:00-ish I think to go up to Port Clinton near Lake Erie. On the way there I made a really cool button bracelet. But I dropped the bag of buttons IN the car, so they were every where. We stopped at Taco Bell (I love that place) and then went on and finally got there. When we got there we found out that pretty much everyone was off somewhere doing something. So we went by the golf course there and honked every time my cousin Chris was about ready to swing his golf club. We finally go their attention, and Chris and David (my two older cousins) came down to see us. After talking with them for 10 minutes we went in to the resort place to change into our swimsuits and we went out by the pool. I didn't feel like swimming so I laid out on a chair by the pool until my Aunt Bridget and Grandma came and we talked for a while. Then I realized how burnt I had gotten so I got out of the sun for a while and then we went to my grandparent's place to change. After that we went over to where my cousins and aunt and uncle are staying to eat dinner. All 14 of us ate over there and then we just hung out for a while. Then my cousins Lizzy, Lauren, and Teresa were going to go swimming over at the pool and asked if I wanted to go with them, so I went and changed and met them up there. I actually had fun. Sometimes I feel kind've left out because they're so tight knit, but I had fun with them!! We were making fun of the lifeguard because she looked so grumpy with this permanent evil look on her face and then we were laughing at this 8 year old kid with..well nevermind. We had fun and we went in the hot tub for a little bit and then went back to their place and about 6 of us played a never ending came of uno until we went to my grandparent's place to go to bed. I slept horrible that night and had to wake up the next morning @ 7:00 to go fishing.  Tuesday: So I kind've wake up around 6:45, but I am half asleep and the TV is on right next to me on the news talking about how people were lining up at four in the morning to buy Bill Clinton's book and I was having a dream about that and Joe House had waited that long to get one and then he was saying "Yes, I have been a huge supporter of Clinton ever since he announced his running for the presidency in such and such year." And I was ticked at him. But then I woke up and realized it was on the TV. It was strange. So we eventually got moving and my grandpa, brothers, mom, cousins David, Chris, Chris's fiance Val, and me all went to Big Boy's to eat breakfast. Then all of us minus Chris and Val went to go get some bait for fishing. Well I have a tendency to get motion sickness sometimes like out on a boat I did once and I used to all the time in the car, so my mom thought I should take something so I didn't get sick out on the boat. So I took this stuff called Drammamine. It said to take one to two tablets, but my mom said "Just take two." So I did. Well I was tired as it was from getting up early, but this stuff made me so drowsy!! We were getting fishing licenses from the store and the guy is saying, "And you need to sign here please" to me and I'm just staring straight ahead, off into space. And he's like "Umm..you need to sign here pleace." And I'm like "Huh..oh me. ok.." And then I felt like I had a speech impediment and my words were slurring together. It was so awful. But I did NOT get sick out on the boat. So that was good. I had fun though. It was really wavy so it was hard walking around the boat sometimes. I caught 3 sheephead...and a rock. I am not even kidding. I caught a big chunk of rock. It had zebra mussels on it. It was quite odd. I was going to keep it, but I didn't want to kill the mussels. My cousin David and I were talking a lot out there though. We have a lot of common interests so I feel closest to him. He's 3 years minus 2 days older than me. So after fishing for a few hours we went back in and got some ice cream from a place near by. We were standing there eating our ice cream when we hear this really loud music, bass cranked up and everything. So David and I turn around expecting to see this really pimped out car and everything...but no. It's a rusty old van. It was really funny actually. And David talked about how he wants to get a car and get some ice cream truck music on a tape and crank it up really loud and have the little kids chase him and laugh as he drives away. lol. Crazy kid. So then we went back to the resort place and my brothers and grandpa went putt-putting and my mom and I went by the pool to meet up with my aunt and grandma. And we talked for a while but I was really tired still so I got a chair and laid down on it and fell asleep for about an hour. Then I got out of the sun because I was burning. Then we went back to my grandparent's place to pack up. We stopped by and said bye to all my cousins and family and went out to eat at Perkin's with my grandparents. Then we started to head for home. But we had to stop in Parma to stop at my mom's friend's dad's funeral (hopefully that makes sense). It was nice to see my mom's friend, but not under the circumstances. After that, we came home.  And here I am now... Today I slept in then ate breakfast and went swimming for a few hours. I am really tan now, which is nice, but some of it is burnt and it's painful.   Ohhhh...and I'm getting a cell phone soon!! We should be getting them tomorrow (My mom and I) so I cannot wait!! Tomorrow I work from 9-2 and that's it. I'm hoping to go driving today sometime... *sigh* I guess that is all for now! Later!
