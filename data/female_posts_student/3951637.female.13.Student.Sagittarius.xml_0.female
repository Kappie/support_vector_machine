Sometimes when you wake up and maybe you couldnt sleep the night before do you ever wonder what time or how you feel asleep? Its wierd. The other night ..now this will sound wierd. It was sorta late but I was wide awake so I grabbed a book,I read the whole book and put it away and thats the last thing I remember..bout a few hours later my dad gets up and I relize my neck hurts so I wake up I am on the floor by the couch with the head like twisted around the leg like maybe how I had fallen from the couch. But then I relize that I had been wearing boxers and I was now in pj pants! I looked at the clock it was  4 am in the morning I was so confused! So I looked at my dad and told him he said he thought I was sleeping on the floor because it had been a hot night and it would be cool on the floor..he is so blind heeh! Anyways so I was like nO! Anyways I was wide awake after that and couldnt sleep I stayed up the whole night just watchin tv or play computer games, but the next day was fathers day so we went out to brunch at like 10 am so I was all ready right away. So we got done with brunch about 12 and so I got home and crashed for like 2 hours then got dressed again because my dad was making a huge dinner and all my siblings were coming over even though he said that he refused to make it because it was his day to relax but that never happens and we all know that!!! Anyways they came over ate and ran basically,except my brother and hes the best hes married and they are the coolest!!! So my dad had a good fathers day after all just being able to see all of his kids together.....see how well i go from sleeping to fathers day in one blog thang! This is cool! Signin off!
