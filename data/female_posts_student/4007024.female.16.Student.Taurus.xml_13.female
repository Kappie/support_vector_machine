( the rain had stopped somewhat by then.. thank goodness). but it ended up being a great night bonding with the girls. we all had a goodtime. and mom actually let me stay the night at mils without parents. i mean she had to have been drunk or something. good times.  today i was pretty freaking lazy and i had to bring judson somewhere.. blah blah. and then i went to zacharys to hang out with some friends and watched people play pool and ping-pong. and bonding with some people i'm not really that close with so that was good. mrs. julie baked us cookies!!! YuM. :-P zac's parents are the best.  then i had to go get judsons bitch ass from next level.. ugh. and then bring scott home. i mean seriously.. am i a damn taxi? yeah it freaking seems like it.  louisiana definately won miss teen america! woohoo. atleast something good comes out of LA. i mean shit i want out of this place.  going to houston to shop next weekend. and visit with laura and fam. but i'm out b/c i've said all i really want to say. later.
