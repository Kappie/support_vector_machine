At least I slept in tho.. ppl didn't wake me up which is really good cause if they had I would have been incredibly pissed off.  Ughhh... my brother just came home all pissed off at his friend because his friend wanted to play Risk and Anders didn't want to. God thats fucked... now they'll be like pissed at each other for like a week and I'm gonna have to sit through Anders talking about his "problems" because my mom isn't here to listen to them... dammit!  I'm thinking that it woulf be fun to paint a room right now... maybe our front entry, cause my mom has wanted to do that for like a year and she already bought the paint... I could do that for her so when she gets home it's all done... except I don't think my dad would let me do that until I clean my room because he would prolly want me to do that more than paint, and painting would just give him more of a mess to clean up. So maybe... I should clean my room today and then it would be done and I wouldn't have my dad yelling at me to and then he'd like leave me alone... maybe I'll go do that now. Cept not RIGHT now cause I like need to wake up a little more first... no okay I just don't feel like it at this very moment... I'll go in a little bit just not right now.   I wanna play The Sims... but I have to get off the comp soon cause my bro is gonna kick me off so by the time it loads and I start playing I'm gonna have to get off the comp anyways... man I can't wait till the Sims 2 comes out... in september... why couldnt they have released it in the summer cause then yeah everyone could have played it a lot more. Meh... at least this way I wont be completely hooked on just doing that for the entire summer. So maybe it is a good thing that it isn't being released in the summer. But I'm prolly going to spend just as much time on the comp doing nothing as I would have playing it... oh well maybe I'll figure something to do on the comp thats helpful... meh I'd actually have to look to find something new... right now all I do is type shit in here and surf the Student Center forums and talk to Dylan and the occasional other person on MSN.  I want someone to play ouija with... it gets kinda boring after awhile but I mean you can still spend like an entire afternoon playing it without realizing you've been playing that long.  Chads coming home tonight... maybe we'll be able to do something tomorrow... that would make the day so much less boring. But for today... it seems that I will be cleaning my room and then tonight we're going to our neighbours house for supper... which hopefully will be good, and then maybe tonight to see my mom again. It's really hard because we went to see her last night and she like has a tube down her throat draining her stomach and stuff and I don't think I've ever seen her like that down. She needs to get out of the hospital.. that's like what will make her better. Being in her own house with her animals and family around and just being away from the smells of the hospital and that room she's been in for the past like 3 weeks.
