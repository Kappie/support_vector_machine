I have discussed this in several other sections of the paper, and think that in this, my second to last section it is important to revisit.  The online journal blurs lines in several ways: The blog creates a relationship between the author and the audience- both of which only know of each other in a virtual world, but both assume that they exist in the real world as well and the online journal creates a space that has the social aspects of the real world, but with few of the real world impacts if you do something wrong.    The relationship between author and audience is one of trust.  Part of the thrill of reading about someone else’s exploits is that they happened.  There is no fun in it if you find that it is all fiction.  I readers expect what I write to be real or to have clearly defined markers of what is and isn’t real.  When I am writing a piece of fiction, they should be able to tell.  For example, on  urlLink March 29th  I undertook to write a bit of fiction for my blog.  I can only assume that my readers knew this, considering how obvious it is.   I would not tell them a story that was obviously false however.  If I wanted to write about something, and not tell them what it was, well, that’s fine.  They get to hear me describing the emotions, or the after effects, or the state the event put me in.  I just don’t write about the event, as in the case of  urlLink April 3rd   At other times, when I have a more concrete story to tell, well I tell the story (see April 5th right above the linked space above for just such an instance.) According to McNeill this is a common occurrence in blogs, and if an active audience finds out that they have been mislead, they retaliate.  Its never really occurred to me to not be truthful in the blog.  This honest relationship succeeds in smudging line of reality however.  By telling real stories in an unreal space, recounting physical events on a physic plain, we are blurring lines.  By believing a form of a person that we only encounter out in internet space, and believing that they exist outside of the medium of the blog, we are blurring lines.  The space that we create is a superman phone booth.  As we move onto the online reality, the virtual reality, this phone booth is there.  In the phone booth we can either take off a persona or put one on.  Using my blog I have the fluidity to create a slightly expanded personality or a more vulnerable one.  I am able to try on different parts of myself, show different parts off, and become new in some way.  I believe that a blog, and much of the online world, gives you the option to do both at once.    When I am writing my blog I am not putting on untruths- I am attempting to express myself more.  I am taking off a protective viel- I am saying things that I am sometimes unwilling to say in real life to a person.  However, I am also expanded that part of me, trying it out to see how it will be received if I were to make it part of my everyday life.  When I write, “ urlLink I think that I will also clean this house, deep corners and organizing. I will wipe out all the sediment of winter resentment, angry cobwebs whipping in the air. I think that I will focus on the surface well wiped. As I clean I will cry, I will maybe wash out the dust that's been left under the bed of my heart. I will wash and mop and sigh all of this crusty memory. Those memories that leave me tense or sad or wondering in a painful way, I will lay them out and see which are worth fretting over, and in the end they will all be carefully wrapped and labeled and stored, easy to access and easy to put away ,”  I am talking about an emotional inner self that I would not normally share with those other then my close friends.    Here, in my blog, I am trying to express it to a wider audience.  In trying out emotions, ideas, words on a larger audience. I am attempting to become a new self.  When I enter the virtual world through these words, I have the option to write parts of myself out that do not appear in everyday life for a variety of reasons.   You are receiving a real piece of me, and you are also receiving a new piece of me.  You are receiving parts of me that are dusted off and reshaped and baked and cleaned and polished and ready not quite ready to meet the world… but those parts are getting there.  This is a place where people are able to construct communities, audiences, companions, that exist in the world but are hard to find.  Blogs are creating a new world in which we are able to question ourselves, our stories, and our world.
