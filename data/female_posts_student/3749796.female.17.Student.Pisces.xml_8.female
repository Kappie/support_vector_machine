My beloved HDB flat in some part of Tampines, my favourite place in the world... and soon, i will be leaving to another... I just loved this 5- room flat...  It went through with me the many big things which happened in my life...And it's really sad to know that it will be an empty space very soon and a new family will be moving it...renovating it differently from the way it used to look like... I told my sis that I will return one day, buy the flat over, and renovate it the way it's like now... But it's rather stupid for me... to be writing such a long entry just because i'm moving soon... SAD!
