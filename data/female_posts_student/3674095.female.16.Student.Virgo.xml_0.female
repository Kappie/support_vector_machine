Non-attachment is the secret, and non-attachment is a product of valuing true life above all else.  What a difference it would make if human beings loved their own lives, but instead they love their unconscious illusions, like children who hide forbidden and dangerous toys in the cellar.  The spiritual adult knows how to walk casually away from all that is not worth his attention.   --The Daily Guru
