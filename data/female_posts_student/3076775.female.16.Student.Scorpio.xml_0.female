Please refrain from dying of shock at the mere idea of me having clean living quarters. Besides that, everything's been quiet. Ah! It's cold outside! It was warmer during Fall Break! Darn the weather! Ah well, it could be worse... OOh! I'm having people over Saturday for DDR!!!! I can't wait!!!! And I get to see a certain someone else who I miss very much (ain't sayin who though, but you know who you are). And besides cleaning, I'm going to start exercising again today. Hehe, about time too, I'm gettin flabby again! Well, that's all I've got for right now. (I can't write as much about my day as Chelsea can..lol) Well, ttyl.
