Though I did wander more than I usually do today, I actually knew where I was going for half the time. All of those mall trips really pay off. I was supposed to have this BBQ thingy with my Uncle/Aunt today, but it rained, so it was cancelled, and Alicia and I decided to go to the mall. Then it turned out that my Uncle was at the mall at the same time that I was, and he came over to our house anyways, but I still got to shop, so I was happy. I got a black skirt with white polka dots from Delia*s, a pair ofdark blue, satinChucks for only $20, shoe laces to go with them from Hot Topic, and a blue flower pin from Express, for only $5. I'm so proud of my buys, and that fact that I didn't majorly splurge, which I have a tendency to do when I've had mall deprivation, and when I have a lot of money with me, which I did today. I mean, I actually had money left over in the end. I think that Alicia and me have had our shopping skills decrease since we've been away from the mall for so long. It's quite sad really. I mean, we actually had left over time in the end, and we were only there for 4 hours. We've been crammed for time before when we went for 6 hours. What a travesty. But since we were planning to go to the mall this Friday, and obviously aren't anymore, we're planning on going to South Street Friday so Alicia can get some Floaties! Yay!      Anyways, aftermy long sought after mall trip, I came home to a Chinese family gathering. Fun fun fun. Basically, that means lots of Chinese food, lots of talking in Chinese (which I am unable to do), having to spend time with prying relatives, watching my little bratty cousin, and of course, having your parents show off through their children. It's the Chinese way. At least my family isn't as bad as Alicia's family, heh heh. But it did mean that I had to play piano for them, and considering I haven't played piano in over a year, I wasn't too happy about that. But I didn't play toooo badly, just utterly and completely. I didn't even bother playing the whole song, I just played the first part of each and expected them to think it was over. Yay! And then they left... and junk...      Oh yes, and during multiple times in the day, I called Dylan! Yay! We talked, it was fun. And then his mom yelled at him to get off the phone, so we're not talking anymore. *tear*. That's about it for my day. w00t.      ...la Gu
