I suppose i really am going to die all alone and old, and yeah i know im only 15 but come on... Take robert for instance... dated for five months and then just dumped him because 'he was too depressing' for me. God im an idiot. And then he begged me to work it out and we got back together like twice, and each time i was such a bitch to him.... god i have a problem. As i re-examine everything i realized i really fucked things up.. yelling at him, cursing at him, not talking to him for days... dude.. i suck. Maybe i jump into relationships too fast.. yeah... that could be it. Maybe i date guys too old for me (last boyfriend 19).... i suppose i really need to re-evaluate the way ive been going about these things... hmmmmmm i suck.
