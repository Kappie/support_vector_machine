Don't wanna stir anything. So whatever. All I gotta say is:  think what you want ...   Talking to Moca on the phone. Haha! Woke her up from sleeping on the couch. She fell asleep watching TV! :D Tofu to the rescue! ...or not! Hehe ^^~ So yeah. Whatever. So bored.   I wanted to go outside today after school but whatever. My sister's going outside and I have guitar lesson later so yeah. Nathan, Caleb, Joseph, and Timothy. Ew~ Haha! Bleecchhh~ Zoe and Ingrid would love to be in my class, maybe? Haha! Ingrid is probably going like "Whaaat?!" right now but yeah. Bleh. Whatever.  Haven't spoken to Ingrid in a while. The two of us need to talk. Mehe! ^^ Mystery Murder Night. Might talk then or not. Dunno. Whatever. Blah. So yeah. I'll wear my COWBOY HAT to church on Friday! ...or not! I don't know... if I feel like it. Well, gonna practise on guitar for now. Blog later... maybe. Might not be in the mood. Whatever. Going off for now. I'll read Wilfred's blog and then practise. Hehe~ Bye bye! Peace! XOXO *mwahzZ*
