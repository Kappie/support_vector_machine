And maybe getting rid of stuff will give me a chance to change around my room a bit. Sunday Bradley came over and it was a lot of fun. I hadn't seen him for about 10 days since he was gone and it was just great seeing his face again and just being held. We saw A Cinderella Story and I thought it was really cute. I liked it a lot. Then, Monday I did more stuff for the garage sale and cleaned out my little closet. Yesterday, Brad and I got to see a real life Open Heart surgery. It was really REALLY cool. Like most people would get sick and what-not, but it was really awesome. They had to break open the lady's chest to get to her heart and then cut open the pericardium (the protective tissue around the heart)and then they stopped the heart by this machine called the "Heart-lung machine". They got a vein from her leg and put it in her heart from the one that was blocked. Then they started put the heart again and it was just amazing. We were there for about 4 hours and it still wasn't over with. Then we volunteered at Lutheran and just did the cheer cart and stuff. Mom and I took him home and then came back to my house. I cleaned out some stuff in my room for the garage sale andI was up until about midnight trying to finish. In conclusion, I still have so much more to do and I just wanna cry and go take a nap. So I better get back to it. Everyone have a good day.
