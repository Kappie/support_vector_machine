Tomorrow morning I have to have a colonoscopy to figure out what the heck is causing me so much pain.  So, to sum up, I'm haven't eaten, haven't slept, and am quite stressed out.  I am also mentally drained, because I am physically tired from excessive analyzing and reasoning; I think I'm to the point that I just need to turn all this over to the Lord, because no amount of mental debate is going to provide me with a stronger faith than I already have.  This has been exceedingly difficult to accept, as I always want to intellectually rationalize everything.  I need to just let it go and let the Holy Spirit do His work.  I feel like I'm suddenly with Jesus in the desert being tempted with no food or rest; the deceiver keeps throwing darts at me again, and because I'm so weak at the moment, the only thing I can do is shove the Good Book in his face and hold onto Christ for dear life.  I cannot WAIT for the day that we are renewed and no longer have to fight spiritual warfare.  I'm going to go eat God's Word, because at this juncture that's the only source of nourishment I've got.
