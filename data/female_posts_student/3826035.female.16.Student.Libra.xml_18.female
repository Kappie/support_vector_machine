So, because I'm bored, I'm doing what I always do when I'm bored. I shop for Dollfies. I hope to get a MSD next year, once I've been working for a while. ^ ^ So expensive though... @ @. I got bored in C.A.L.M. today, and I drew me:      (tinted and reversed because otherwise you couldn't see shit... o O. Stupid 2H pencil...)
