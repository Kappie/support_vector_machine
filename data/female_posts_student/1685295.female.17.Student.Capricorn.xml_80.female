Now I've really started to wonder;  is craptacular a word? Can it even function in the viod of slang terms too stupid to ever come out of a person's mouth?  ::Look through many different grammer books:: Guess what!  Craptacular can be a word!  Because of latin syntax, you can join  crap  and  tacular . It's very sad for me to see myself making such an ass of myself on the internet. But hey, What the hell it's not like my name's on the bottom of this post or anything like that... Shit...I fucked! My name is not Conrad,  MY NAME IS KUNTAKINTE!
