Yes, most old people roll up their pants (trousers?  where are you from, England?)  I'm assuming this is for one of your plays, but I still feel kinda weird about this... Anyway, I'll be right back.  I'm going to go check out your website now that they've  finally  got it launched.  And Josh, I really do want a cd of your songs, I wasn't just kidding yesterday.
