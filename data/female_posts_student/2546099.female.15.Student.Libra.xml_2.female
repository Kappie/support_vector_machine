Well yesterday was christmas, i thought it was going 2 be a fantastic day, but it was the same as it is every year. Dad telling annoying and reali bad jokes, andrew being a bit of a smart arse, mum feeling ill and grumpy after cooking and me trying 2 b happy with the day even though again it disatisfied me. Sumtimes i think it would b better not clelbrating christmas, i mean its lost all its meaning neway. Its just a way in which companies make money, children get spoilt and ppl eat till they cant eat nemore while there r starving children out there. It makes me sick when i think of it that way. I remember when i used 2 believe in santa, it was so much fun then. I wish i was a kid again, then i wouldnt have 2 think as much, worry as much and get hurt as much. And of course if i was still a lil girl i wouldnt have 2 worry about getting my heart broken.  Sumtimes, no a lot of the time i wish i had neva moved here. I wish we had of stayed in perth, i used not like it as much as melbourne but its betta then here. I guess u could say since moving here my happiness has detereated (excuse my spelling lol) and it still continues. I dont think i delve in2 that 2nite tho, i think ill go 2 bed, im tired and i have work 2moro...need sleep...lol. Well not that much that im falling asleep at da computer. Well until anotha entry, hope i havent bored whoeva reads this 2 much. AMybe ill add sum of my words of wisdom in my next entry.
