Kayla said she will help me pick out my first day of skool outfit and i really didn't know it mattered what you wore on the first day of skool...just goes to show how much i know, right? well i miss everyone like crazy. Last night i told Mike i wasn't gonna talk to anyone at skool or in houston cuz it's makin me miss home, then he pressedat button on the fone i my ear and it hurt...i so i'm gonna keep talking to my friends in houston cuz yea...i love them and it would make me sadder if i didn't talk to them.      Tommy just made popcorn ima go eat some:) and play video games with them.            I LOVE MIKE           LATA MOTHER TRUCKERS!!!
