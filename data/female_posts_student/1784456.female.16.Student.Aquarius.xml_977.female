I just found out that I'm almost at the end of FFX and I err... haven't really been bothered levelling up and stuff cause I thought I wasn't that far into it ...oops. Ah heck. And now I've gotta beat Seymour and I kinda keep dying... Pitiful really. I don't even have regen! Whoops! So now I'm running around like an idiot for ages trying to get every one's HP up to about 4,000 when they're all on 2,500! AARGH! Why didn't some one tell me?! WHOOPS! And I err... kind of missed out all the extra Aeons and err all the sidequests. Oh, I'm good!  urlLink http://www.ffextreme.com/  Go there amd be ashamed that you finished the game without noticing all this stuff! I am! Oooh dinner... *drools* Sure is a hard life when you're a pig *sigh* LAURA'S GOT A BIG BUM! Just thought I should mention it...
