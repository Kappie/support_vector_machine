Although the little experiment thing we did I found like really confusing, so I had to ask Brent after class about it cause I had no idea what was going on.  After like 5 explanations from him I finally understood it, and afterall it wasn't as hard as it seemed.  That is why I didn't ask the teacher in the first place.  Sometimes I feel that I am just annoying, always asking questions, though maybe I am just super paranoid.  English was good.  We finished watched Good Morning Vietnam and now we are watched Billy Elliot for film study.  Though I am kind of worried cause on the ucourses site my average shows up as 0% with a comment mark entered.  Everyone knows I don't have 0 and when I asked my base teacher what I got she told me that I had an 84%, and well prouxl told me that something about the English is messed up because on another girls it said she had 15%.  Yeah, there is definitely something wrong.  Active living was amazing today.  We did social/ballroom dance today.  Yesterday we did break dance and I got to go in the break dancing circle!  It was soooo much fun!  Anyways today I swear it was like guys fighting over me.  I would start dancing with one, and Swain said that if a guy tapped the other on the shoulder, they had to kindly exchange partners.  Guys kept trying to dance with me, and this one creep kept trying to come back, but whatever.  Maybe he liked me or something, I suppose there is really nothing wrong with having a crush on a someone.  Also Swain pulled me over and was like "I want to show you something" and I was like "oh goodness what are you going to do?"  Then we had to like hook arms and "sway" into a certain position ready for the dance.  I did it once and then he was like "ok now if you could just flow a bit more and loosen up"  OMG, it was like so odd, but I like dancing with him.  And ok I can officially say that I danced with the gym teacher.  So I guess I am entitled to think a teacher is hot right...cause like damn Swain is an amazing dancer and he is hot.  Shhh....!  No telling, that is my little secret.  After school we did a read through of the play during rehearsal and then I went home, ate some Chile and did my Bio homework.  How exciting!  LOL.
