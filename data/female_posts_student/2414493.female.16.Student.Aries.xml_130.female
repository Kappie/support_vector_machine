Come on, its a "college class, its a college class, its a college class!" hahahaah make me laugh"  Strong human self-righteousness is interesting. Faulkner wrote a Marble Faun too.  Interestingly, I see some of that in myself. Freshman year English I was very much that way. What a moron I was.  Just making sure we're still all on track.
