Now since I am Jessica's friend and I am on her "home turf", I am forced to be using correct grammer or Jessica might shoot me. Since you know it's been a couple of intense months of her trying to get me to switch over to blogspot. With all the blackmail in cut up newspaper letters, strange phone messages with the Darth Vader voice, and I must say the horse's head in the bed was a tad too much and very unorignal. So Jessica, I have given into your peer pressure with the constant "Come on Kate! All the cool kids are doing it!" and have finally given in.  So ..I am here. Um. I didn't do much today. Like all other days. I woke up and had a bagel. That's actually new for me, I normally don't have bagels for breakfast. Now I was trying to come up with the real reason for the hole in the middle of the bagel while eating it and decided it's for fashion purposes only. And that the bagel was jealous of the donut, cause let's face it, the donut gets a lot more attention, so it was just following the crowd. Except the donut in the long run was better off with the hole, cause it's made that whole business on "donut holes", just incase you know, people really need that part of the donut. Now who wants a bagel hole? But then again, this is America, and us Americans need the damn donut hole cause it's unhealthy and we're all fat and need the extra calories. If we only had bagel holes, what kind of society would that be? A crazy society let me tell you. I mean, can you imagine someone walking into a party and saying "I bought bagel holes!". "Oh thanks Joe. That was awfully kind of you. I might have to kill you now." I can completely picture that situation. And now some of you may be thinking, now Kate, what kind of person brings donut holes to a party anyways?...Rhode Islanders do. You know why? Because Rhode Islanders are OBSESSED with donuts. There is a donut place every five miles. Dunkin Donuts is the king here. It dominates all the others. But the others still survive. I've never had so many variations of donuts in my life until I moved here. I feel bad for the diabetics.  But at the rate of the Dunkin Donut business most of Rhode Island will be a diabetic in the near future.
