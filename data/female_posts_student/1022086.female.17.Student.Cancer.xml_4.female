Hence, I shouldn't attempt to sing notes so far beyond my range.   If Kim's reading this, she's likely disapproving. I know, I know. I did it again. I hurt my throat trying to sing a low bass note.   I was singing along to Blur, and I can sing along with Damon just fine, but... well, his voice is rather low, and I hit a note that was waaaaaaay beyond my range, and that really hurt. I really need to cut it out, or I will ruin my throat badly.   *sigh* Okay, I'm done now.
