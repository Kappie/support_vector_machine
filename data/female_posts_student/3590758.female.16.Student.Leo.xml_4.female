OF COURSE IM SERIOUS...some people i know, im surprised exsist in real life... Do geeks know they're geeks? do they wake up in the morning, look at theirself in the mirror and think "wow, im such a loser?"..probably not..does that mean...I.. TOO, might be a complete freak and totally unaware of it?!Do stupid people think their smart?Do ugly people look in the mirror and see Paris Hilton?!...Is it possible that Im not as cute and witty as i think i am!!!??! Is that why no one loves me!!!!AM I A HIDEOUS MORONIC FREAK!?..sry about all the punctuation marks... they appear to be foreplay for me... but anyway...all this paranoia might be some kind of computer virus...tapped into my wildest fears and mutated accordingly >.>...Im so pathetic...look at what happens to me when im bored... on a more random thought, ever since nick came back ive been all.. "IM GOING TO DATE HIM GOING TO BECOME A CRAZY DATING-WITH-NICK-GIRL!IM GOING TO DATE HIM!!BUT I LIVE IN BAYPORT! THE OH-SO-HIP, OH -SO-OVERPRICED town i live in!!!, the time has come! i will date that witty boy,we will become rediculously a rich couple and he will shower me with expensive jewelry, send roses to my office in new york and whisper how wonderful i am in my ear while massaging my I-SIT-ALL-DAY-IN-FRONT-OF-A-STUPID-COMPUTER back.....I WILL WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE LIKE THE PERMA-SMILE WOMAN IN COFFEE COMERCIALS!!lol j/k, i made all that up, but i do really lyke nick lol, and i will say no more about how much i actually do want to go out with him and how much i want to sex him up....>.>.......*cough* okay enough said...im leaving. *love n' lollipops* XD
