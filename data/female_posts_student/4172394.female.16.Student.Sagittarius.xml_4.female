Who will ever forget the guy who sang "Lemon Tree". My gosh, I think Singapore Idol is the only place which you can see grown man, dancing like a i-don't-know-what. Where is he going to hide his face after his "spectacular" performance? Ok, atleast he was hilarious and entertaining.      Now, the guy who stripped, and claims he is a "famous eyebrow plucker" is just pure disguesting! Shameless! I don't find him funny, not even a tiny bit. He is just pure disgust. (shudders*)       Ah, and that guy that sang George Michael's Careless Whisper. He literally sang that song that way. My bro shown me a picture of him that someone posted on the net. Guess what was the background? A shop with the sign "Hearing Aids Specialist". Lol, that guy surely needs that!       Lol, I can't wait to watch tomorrow episode. Listening to people howling away, and the judges' critical remarks! But damn, it clashes with CSI Miama season 2. I just figure something out. Oh! There is school tomorrow! Damn! (sobs*)       Latest Soccer News    Guess what? It turns out that Danny Murphy is not going to Spurs after all, since it cannot guarantee him a first place spot. Oh, it seems he is heading for Charlton... And another thing that is getting on my nerve is, when is Owen going to sign that damn contract? From the end of last season to now, he kept saying he is going to sign soon. But when is soon? I hope he is not planning to pull of a "McManamam" stunt. Coz if he does that, every Liverpool is going to hate him! Latest news: it seems that Real Sociedad's Alonso is heading to Anfield. Yeah! Whee! Liverpool seems to be in great shape to take on the new season! I can't wait! It just 3 more days! And....there is the Olympics!!! This is just going to be wonderful!! Cheers!
