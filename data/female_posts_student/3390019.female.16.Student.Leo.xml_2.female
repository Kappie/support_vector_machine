"pimping" is also one of our fav weekend activities that we have become very good at..almost too good at! WE WERE MOONED!!! but we do meet our share of hotties and other mb's that we like to fight with. we also enjoy writing messages on ppl's cars...only nice things of course! lol another aspect of our friendship is the color PINK!!! OH MAN WE LIVE FOR THAT COLOR! basically our dorm room that we plan to have will be focused on that color and that color only! umm sometimes we get a little "horn happy" when we are driving and just go crazy, but usually its pretty funny...cept when so freako lady tries to kill u....literally! to sum it up we are inseperable and pretty much the coolest and funniest ppl u will ever meet! :)
