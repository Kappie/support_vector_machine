Then morehead said that my hour was her weakest class and we had people barely passing and mom suggested that maybe since I was in her weakest class she was being overly critical with me since I was in her bad class((but I have a B)). And my mom said she was like "I can't believe it, but you're exactly right" and she told my mom she would lighten up and accept my monologue with only minor changes.   And then she came back into the room and went into a spew about how she never meant to be mean or rude or a bad teacher but that she only wanted to help us make our work better and bla bla bla she kept yammering I kept saying 'ok, ok' when out of nowhere she starts crying! So she reiterated what she had said, grabbed a tissue, and that was that. But really!!! I finally had one on her, I finally had beat her at her own game, and she turns on the waterworks! Jesus... I guess she's just good at kind of thing, when all else fails, make them feel sorry for you, it's sure to make them give in.  So even though I technically won, the victory wasn't as sweet as it would have been if she hadn't patronized the hell out of me and then started sobbing!  Today I said something silly to jean today and then walked away smiling and this girl I don't know said "she thinks she's cute, doesn't she?" and then started mocking me. For some reason, I can't quit thinking about it. I guess because I hate when people don't like me. I hate it more than anything and in most cases I will go to great lengths to make sure everyone loves me. And what right does she have to be saying things about me? She doesn't even know my name. To me it's amazing that there are people out there who are so conceded that they can insult someone in hearing range without ever having spoken a word to them. I'm not really sure if she meant for me to hear her, but it's not like she whispered or anything, and I was just behind a different set of shelves in the locker room. I wonder if jean shook her head yes when that girl said that.   I've always wondered what people say about me when I'm not around. Hopefully that chick is just a bitch((and not even a cute, skinny bitch like you'd think, a fat frizzy one)) and most people really think I'm "nice". Because to me, I am nice... I never say bad things about people((outside of my blog and my internet friends)) because I know eventually those bad things will get to their ears and will come back to bite me in the ass. And even when I do, it's always because they had in some way hurt me, not because I think they think they're cute.  That stupid girl has got me all upset. Maybe she was having a rough day and just needed to pop off. The only person I can think of who doesn't like me is this girl named %^^%. I don't know why, I don't know what I did, but she always looks at me funny and when she does speak to me, it's always critical and sour. Then the other day I asked to use the phone she and a friend ran up behind and said "so do we!" so the teacher gave us the keys to her office and $%^%$ ran ahead of me and shut the door to the office and her friend stayed on the phone for 7 minutes or so and she saw me getting impatient and turned and smiled her evil "hahaha I was a rude pig and it's getting on her nerves" smile. After 10 minutes I left and they emerged seconds after me. I hate people like that... If you have a problem, you should tell me. Don't torture, ignore, sneer at or talk bad about me to other people. What is it with degenerates like that? I just can't find the sense in it.   I am more ready for this week to be over than any other week I can think of. morehead assigned the monologue, research paper, and powerpoint project all within days of each other and it's wearing me down to the nub. Like I've said before, I won't be able to put this highschool education to good use if I'm in the nuthouse, which is where I'm headed if things don't cool down and get back to the normal pattern.... Or possibly even get back to a better pattern?   Mom wants to send us to mompat's((baaad grandmother)) because she says "when we're here, she can't have fun". Great, just... Great. You know I had a real record going for avoiding her, I haven't seen the woman since last summer. How I managed to get out of Christmas, I don't know myself. But it works for me.
