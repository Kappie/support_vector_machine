I'd tell you but the words get tangled up, you’re right in front of me but you still feel too far to touch. I see you falling and I’d die to pick you up but sometimes dieing just isn’t enough. the rush is soothing and I’m starting to drown, the worlds getting grayer and I’m getting down. It never ends like this on the big screen, they always make up in the last scene. but you’re happy so I’ll sleep sweet dreams tonight. It’s all I ever wanted.  all work © smokeycustard
