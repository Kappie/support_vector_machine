I might go to dance today, im not sure....uh...i had a weird dream last night but i dont really want to go into that right now...lemme tell you this first..i was dead and i came back alive or something..ya, alil weird. but anyway, nothings going on here, just super bored, but its 11:30 so whatever. Nothing ever happens anyway. I think im gonna go play my guitar, i need to learn a new song i finished the YC one but i just need to work on the 'F' chord...ugh..i hate that one. So yep, today i will be looking up chords to different songs, or tabs...i cant read tab but what the heck.
