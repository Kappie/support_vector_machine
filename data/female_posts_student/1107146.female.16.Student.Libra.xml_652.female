But, say we get that Poe essay back and I get a big goose-egg...  See, that's a problem. If I do get a zippo I'm probably going to go off on her, and they's just ain't no gray area in that respect. Actually, I'll probably puss out and sit there and whine about it and get red faced and have Julian sitting there going, "Well it doesn't sound like you, blah blah blah, let me talk out of my ass cuz I think I know what you write like." That little fucking fuck. That pissed me off more than anything. Thanks for the coverage, Linds. I was so pissed off I forgot to come up with that reasonable and obvious defense that would have made me feel a little better despite Julian's chiding.   Damn it. Two deep breaths, c'mon you assclown hypnosis tape, do your magic.
