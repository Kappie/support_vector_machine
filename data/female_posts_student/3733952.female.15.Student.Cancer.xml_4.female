All we did was learn all the scales on the stupid marimba. And the people in the pit are just nerds. I mean NERDS. They don't know how to read music or anything. There was this one girl who plays the clarinet like me. But she left the pit after lunch because of Mit. There's this big whole in the formation where Mit would be if he was still doing band. So she left, and now I'm stuck as the only girl in the pit. I hate it! So there we were, 10 hours to do something. 10. I was so bored out of my mind. And I missed Jack so much. He's out there marching, and I'm stuck inside playing scales. I've always wanted to be in the marching band. And actually MARCH. I have to go through this for 2 straight weeks. And then the rest of the year during practice. And then the rest of high school. I'm gonna be sad my whole life because of this. Don't tell me to quit band because this is what I've always wanted to do. I just need a hug.
