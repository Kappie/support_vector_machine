Actually, it all started with a lack of sleep. I went to bed (or, rather, to couch) at 11.30 pm because I thought I'd get some sleep before the darned beast (SAT). Yeah, RIGHT! I miss my room terribly. The paint job just needs to get done and be over with... There is NO privacy in this darned house outside of my room. I was on the brink of slumber, that calm feeling of utter drugless ecstasy one reaches, when my dad came flip-flopping into the kitchen although I'd priorly explained the issue to him and asked him not to do so. "Whoops, I didn't realize..." MRAH!! Sometimes I get so incredibly frustrated with him. I understand that he can't help the matter most of the time, but it's still annoying, and he never leaves me alone when I'm at home (i.e., if I'm locked in my room, he will knock until I am forced to come out because I can no longer withstand the thunderous "bang, bang, bang" that is easily innerving).   Then, my mom came in to go to the kitchen while speaking obnoxiously loudly. She, too, had forgotten. She moved downstairs and spoke just as loudly to my grandmother, likely thinking she wouldn't be heard. Well, WRONG! Then, my grandmother came to the kitchen and commenced cleaning dishes. On her journey up the stairs, she carried on this annoying thing she regularly does; it's a bit of a song-whisper-whistle, but, trust me, it is HIGHLY annoying. So, by this point pissed and by this point the hour being 1:20 am, I asked her to just clean the dishes in the morning. This lead to one of her rants about how she doesn't have rights to do anything and that I have no respect for her, which just made things worse. I fell asleep about 2:00 am or so and literally jumped when the alarm clock went off at 6:00 am.  I had a good breakfast consisting of eggs, bacon, cheese, fruit, and coffee, and I prepared it myself, without *gasp* burning anything. This was more than likely the highlight of my day.   Needless to say, the SAT was pure crap. The experimental section that they tossed in my test was a math one, as there was an extra math. Of the three 30-minute sessions, there was one that I was pretty positive I gained most points possible on, but I bet you that that was the experimental section. Just watch it happen. The whole test was pretty yucky, as I found a few possible tricks within some math questions and couldn't decide on a few which trick not to fall for--not to mention the fact that I didn't even GET to a total of about 6 or 7 math questions out of the whole test.   The verbal kicked my butt. This was mainly the readings' fault. Only one of them was enjoyable and coherent. The rest were a large mass of crap slapped together. One passage regarding DaVinci contradicted itself, every other sentence. The author would claim DaVinci a genius in one sentence and an idiot in the next, and I'm not exaggerating. It was confusing, and, lo and behold, 10 questions out of the 30 in the section covered this passage only. Once again, I didn't even get to 5 or 6 or 7 or maybe even 8 of the verbal questions. Yeah. I don't think it's worth canceling the score over because my last chance to take the SAT will be in October, which is the next test date. Therefore, I might as well see how this one went. There's really not much to lose but thirty dollars (if I canceled, that is). Grah.  Home. Daddy annoys me. House is a mess and I can't really do anything much about it until I can return the contents of my room TO my room. Grandma annoys me. Ale annoys me. I check my inbox and discover that Kathryn, a student whose email was given to me by Mrs. Smith, her AP Chemistry teacher from two years ago (and mine this year, if you didn't know) has replied. Mrs. Smith had noted several congruities between our intentions for college and thought it'd be appropriate that I communicate with Kathryn and hear (or, well, read) what she had to say/advise. So, I emailed her. She responded that, first of all, I was mistaken regarding the possibility of a music minor at State. I could have sworn I read there was a music minor, but she revealed to me that she had attempted to do the same but had been told that all possibilities with that included but a music major.   She did, however, tell me a bit about Music at Tech. They do presently offer a minor, which is new, and they like to entwine scientific views and musical, which is, quoting Kathryn, the "Techy" way to approach it. She did say that it was a pretty good program regardless of what many said and that Tech is working on obtaining a major in music program. She advised that I not do the dual enrollment, as music at State is tougher than it seems in the sense that very much time, even in a minor, has to be invested in music (an original thought of mine confirmed). She doesn't think anyone'd be able to handle such a task in concurrence with GA Tech's Nuclear Engineering major, and I understand what she means as I had kind of been fooling myself into believing that will can get anyone as far as he/she wants to go.   So, I'm yet again puzzled over what to do. My mother is of no help, as always, and simply thinks I should just join a choir and leave it at that. She just doesn't get it.   I figured I could cheer myself up with some coffee and Noir; I had burnt a few episodes on CD and, for some reason, this stupid computer has ceased to want to play videos from file. Winamp video works online, but I can't get it to go back to the default settings that allow it to play video files. I am almost positive that this was accidental action of my mother, as she doesn't know how to handle computers, makes messes, and later washes her hands clean of the issue by claiming I did it and must fix it. *Sigh*  Anyway, I watched Noir on the Ghettomachine, where it worked perfectly, which tells me that there is, indeed, something wrong with video on this computer. Grah. I don't feel like dealing with that right now.   I think I will go waste away and complete a few other useless actions somewhere else in this messy, horrendously messy, home.
