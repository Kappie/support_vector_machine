I sat at a table with two other girls and one hunky guy. :) I sat across from the hunky guy, but of course. lol.  We were taught how to eat Continental Style. Fork in left hand, upside-down and using the knife to push rice onto the upside-down tines of the fork. It was interesting to say the least.  The first course was a nice salad. The second course was a hearty vegetable soup, Main course was Chicken Cordon Bleu, and finally a lovely light mousse for dessert. Since there were many extra desserts, my tablemates and I opted for a second round. :)  What a lovely event that was! And it was only put on for senior humanities students. I'm glad that I decided to go single. Most everyone at the dinner was single as well.  Hence, my seating arrangement. My back was to the rest of the room and so everytime the speaker spoke I had to twist gracefully around.  And naturally the hunky guy had to look past me while she spoke as well. :) Sneaky and  I did some light flirting since that's what one must do when the guy at the table is a hunky italian and the other girls are way way less cuter than you. :)
