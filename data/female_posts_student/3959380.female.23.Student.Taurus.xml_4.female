As a whole the team played ten times better this week, plus we had two new experienced players - Chuck and Stuart - who added another dimension to our team.  After the game we went to Suse's place for her Christmas in July dinner and ate some plum pudding.  I think that I have eaten too much chocolate and am in a perpetual sugar low because today and yesterday all I wanted to do was fall asleep after lunch.  Will probably play more frisbee tonight with the first begginers session and then Jamie, some of Jamie's friends and I are going to the Palace to see Franz Ferdinand.  I didn't buy a Muse ticket because I'm too broke.
