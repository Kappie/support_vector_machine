Sometimes you wake and see A morning bright and clear A holiday, you think From dark past yesterday Someone else you were to be Someone else held your fear Yesterday, you needed a drink Yesterday, you werenâ€™t so afraid All the troubles far and gone The lashes prove your ignorance He punished you for your ignorance And lack of imitation of that girl The perfect one The one you despise You see through her charm of lies They cant see as you do But he wants you like her Why cant you be loved like her?
