I was up so late finishing one paper and starting another one.  And there was the time that I  had  to spend on the phone with Ani.  Then another call back to him at three in the morning...  "I am fucking brilliant.  The word is 'compliance'."  Yup, I called him at three a.m. to tell him that I remembered  the word.   Then I was awake at nine.  Ugh.  We're supposed to go out with Ky and Ames and many others for a night of wild drinking (and open-mike night!) at the  urlLink James Joyce .  It should be good.  I'm thinking about asking Ani if he wants to take a trip out the 'burbs to come get me, but I'm not counting on it.  For such a daring urbanite driver, he seems scared shitless of the 'burbs.  That's actually because he's a yuppie.  He thinks O-Town is a hick town.  I keep trying to explain, we've got a large and largely affluent population.  Not a straw-hat among us.  Try telling him that, though.  It's getting so hard to distinguish my  feelings  for him from my lust for him.  Again today, Ani was talking about the end.  Actually, while he was in the shower I saw a note scribbled near his phone, from his last conversation with his pundit.  Get a job, stop eating meat that comes on four legs, and don't commit until 2006-7.  Uh, excuse me?  He's not supposed to commit yet, although, "psychics" are always really more psychologists.  That was probably just some pseudo-parental advice.  But I know he takes stuff from his pundit really seriously.  Hmm...I wonder what that means for us.  I should probably ask him if he's ever talked to his pundit about me, about us.  In the meantime, I'm going to mull over a quote that made Ani laugh pretty hard:  "In the beginning, the universe was created. This made a lot of people very angry, and has been widely regarded as a bad idea."           -- Douglas Noel Adams
