Actually, it warn't so bad, and I was talking like a dayum redneck for the longest time! And then I came back home to my Yank family. Sigh. It sucks not being able to say "ah-raht" and "wont" (there's no "a", seriously) and "ain't" (as a commonplace). And they had some mean potato salad.  Anyway...my meds are screwing me up. When I'm awake and walking around, I tend to get depressed, which factors out to tired, and when I lay down, I start to get ultra-ultra manic: mostly cuz I have lots of time to think, so therefore, I can't sleep. It's a vicious, man-eating cycle, but you live and learn and then get Luvs.  I really feel like making a really EMO post back on my blog, and I think I will. No use defiling " The  (notice that) Blog" with filthy rantings.
