Then it was off to the workshop for the Spring Play, "Anything Goes". Its cool because its jazz music, but we had to learn a very difficult dance to audition with. It was really hard, like no one knew what to do. I'm totally going to butcher it in myt audition and make up my own dance. Anywho, then I had voice lessons. I recorded the National Anthem on a tape which I am planning on sending to various local baseball teams like the Cubs, Sox, Flyers, etc. Fun. I think if I have to sing the national anthem one more time today I will fall over. We did it like 20 times, it was crazy. Then after that, I went home, got my shoes and pantyhose and then went to my band concert which I ended up being slightly late for, I had to dress in the bathroom in a minute flat. I think I set the record for putting on pantyhose. I put them on in like 20 seconds, resulting in a massive bunch. Yeah, pantyhose = not cool. I got to the band room in time, though, and we played a good concert. Steve Pyter was there, but I didn't get a chance to talk to him. Also, Mr. Snoeck is now in the BOA Director's Hall of Fame, so yay for him. That's awesome. So tomorrow, I have East Ensemble after school and then I am planning on going to Contest Play Construction, which was moved from today to tomorrow. I'll probably definitely go to that because apparently we get double thespian points or something. Very cool. Oh and I do not understand my algebra assignment AT ALL. This stuff is crazy. Meh, I'll ask someone tomorrow. Guess what?! I got into Honors Chemistry next year!!! YAY FOR ME!!! I still don't know if I'm taking it because I've heard its a rather difficult course, but I'm still thinking about it. We'll see. Tootles!
