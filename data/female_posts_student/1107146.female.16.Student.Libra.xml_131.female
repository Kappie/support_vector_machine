That will be a hellacious life, and I can already tell you that some will take it the wrong way, but if you think that is the answer to this short life cycle, then by all means take it.  What do you want to do with your life? If your grandfather's death is telling you this, then there actually must be something there that you're thinking about? A major change? A few smaller ones? I have no idea. The fact is, and for all of what you may draw from this scenario, that you need to live for yourself, and whatever you feel you need to get out of this, do, because, thankfully, it doesn't happen all the time.  But when it does, there's always a lesson to be learned.
