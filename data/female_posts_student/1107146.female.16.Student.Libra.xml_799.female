Seriously, it was like, dead quiet in the room, and we were sitting there after he said, "Yah, it's like, one month today," and we kind of sat there yelling, "Hmm...I think he's on to us, Josh," "Yeah, you might have a point there, but it's great that he  remembered !" "Yeah, he suprised us all by not being a stupid dick for a change!" "Really!" Until Kelly shut us up. I hope he did something fabulous for ya.  So today marks three days without Abby...if this letter doesn't do the trick I think I'll have to bail Donnie out and see what we can do about the situation. And it probably won't because it's AWFUL! I sucked up the best I could, I just hope that's enough. And it probably won't be, I'll have to enclose a severed finger, three toes and a tongue for them to actually consider my lowly words...well, worst-case scenario. I hope they understand I'm not  actually  doing this because I give a shit about them a'tall. Grr. I want to be pissed really bad, but moreover I want Abby back.  I'm going to finish transcribing that letter and Christianizing  Painpainted  for the talent show. Come see us! Feb. 19 at 7pm in the Campbell Center! Well we haven't tried out yet, but if this song doesn't do it, then nothing really will.  We're having some problems, tho...mostly, Nick doesn't like Charlie, and Charlie doesn't like Nick...and sadly, I have to side with Charlie on this one. Nick is really trying to grab too much fuckin' harness on this one, i.e.: including Matt Leper...that's three guitars, um...a bit of overkill there. And Charlie could just as well "bring the Death" like we need it. So we're all rather pissed, sort of. Me, mostly cuz I have to change my damn song. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Christianity, I actually quite enjoy the idea, but changing lyrics...NOOOOOOOOO. No no no no. Bad.  Peace, homies.
