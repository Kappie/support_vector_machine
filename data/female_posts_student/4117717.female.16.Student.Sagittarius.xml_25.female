They all, always have the following... -Girls with "booty" -Way too much "bling" -Cars that jump -Little children. If you don't belive me on the last one, just watch one, there is always little children. Which confuse the hell out of me, cause like...What? Anyways, so in the morning I am forced to watch Dawson's Creek. Which is painful in itself because it is the sappiest show I have ever watched. They have wayyyyyyyyy too many problems. I think I would kill myself if I had that many problems. And just taking turns sleeping with everyone I know would be confusing for me. God, don't these kids realize that people are starving all over the world and here they are moaping about how Joey broke up with Pacey???? I'm sorry, maybe I should just turn off the tv. And all this kissing in this show just makes me depressed. I swear, if their not kissing they are either crying or expressing their feelings which either leads to kissing or crieing. If life was like that I think I would be crieing most of the time. Cause since no one wants to kiss poor lil Kate :( hahaha....    ANYWAYS...I just finished eating my bagel. I see that my family has gotten into my bagel stash and now there are only 2 left for the entire week. But that's ok. And I am not going to go off on my bagel tangent. DAMNIT now Save by the Bell is on. But thankfully at noon, Unsolved Mysteries is on so I just watch that. I just love those Unsolved Mysteries. The music though is just a wee bit creepy. Ah, damn, it's about aliens, I might have to turn the channel.   So today will be another exciting day in my life. That will consit of me being in my pajamas for most of the day and taking turns from the tv to the computer. So I'm looking forward to seeing Sean on Friday cause it will give me something to do AND I'll be seeing Sean. Even though my parents might kick us out of my house a little bit early, since my parents want to go to the beach or something...Stupid me not having a car. Um, or lisence.   Why are all the alien sightings in deserted areas? Like, why not a big city? This bugs me. If i was an alien I'd go to a big place. Not Roswell. And who wants to go to Arizonia anyways? Whatever.
