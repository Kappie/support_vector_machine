I've decided to try a little bit of a  urlLink gourmet meal , which I'm kind of stoked about. I can do most of the cooking tonight, and I'll just make some scones tomorrow morning. Along with coffee, OJ and mimosas I think I might be okay. I just counted, and there will be 12 people to feed. Might be exciting. But that grocery store trip was a little scary. I bought too much expensive food, and I still need chocolate and orange marmalade. Cost plus, here I come.
