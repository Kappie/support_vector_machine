So Right now, I'm at my cousin, Lenni's, graduation reception.  It's not exactly my kind of party.  It's either all people over 40, or boys my age, who only know how communicte in video game language.  I sat for a while watching them play thier X-box games, and I was thinking that had I put some bars around them, and gotten some peanuts, I could as well have been at the zoo.  They even have thier own system of communication like animals.  Oh well, I got my fair share of friends time before I left.  I don't think I've ever been as social as I was at the end of June.  I don't think I have much else to say.  I think I might go read my book.  Living the wild life now!  Miss/Love you all.  Talk more later.
