Something big, something wonderful, something that I'm afraid none of us can replace. Somewhere in the drama, and the fun - the wild excitement - somewhere in all that we lost something. We've lost ourselves. We lost our spirits, our hearts, our minds...we all let go.  What happened to us? We used to be so alive; so vibrant and so carefree. None of us are alive anymore. Not like before. Not like then. Everyone was so different. Now we're all different from one another, but all same unfortunately.  We're nothing. I'm nothing.  -Is that all you've got? -...I've got nothing.  I hate us all. Because we never saw it coming.  "and we never planned on this disaster"  God dammit it's true.  I can't be this anymore. I can't be anything because I can't be who I once was.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year.  Then I can go. I can start over. God I want to start over. God I want to start over.  I'm sick of who I am. In a year...in a year I start a new life.  The life I left.  i hate myself.  i hate us all.  we've all lost ourselves.  don't reminisce crazies. it hurts.
