But first, today's journal entry:  Had to stop for a double shot espresso first thing this morning.  I was nearly snoozing the whole drive there.  Going to be a long year.    The espresso ended up giving me a tummyache (not to mention I have a nervous tummy anyway), but I guess it was either be in pain or fall asleep in class.  I'm sure you know which of those two options seems more rational...  :)  Prayer request>That I don't sleep through my alarm (or turn it off in my sleep, which I've been known to do)!     First lecture this morning (4 hours worth) - communication, roles, Maslow, basic human needs, all that good stuff.  Dumb me went and bought a mini-tape recorder last night, but then walked off and left it at home today.  Back to the organization being key, again.  Get organized beforehand, there's a useful tip.    Our lecturer around lunch hour must have been competing for the Guiness World Records fastest speaker award.  We were all relieved to see she gave us handouts with a variety of terms on them.  Nevermind that none of them were used in her lecture, and just forget about trying to write down anything off her Powerpoint slides.  I hope she publishes them on the web later because the whole class was frustrated with that one.  I'll admit that I don't have a lot of sympathy for my classmates so far.  Am I bitter?  Maybe.   Jealous?  Maybe.  I'm not ruling out any possibilites.  Most of the conversations I heard this morning went as follows, "did you do the assigned reading?"  The answers were mostly, "well my boyfriend called..." or "I went to Hunt club and didn't get in..." (local bar), etc etc etc.    Social cliques are already forming.  This is the South after all, and Southern culture still reigns.  Brand names everywhere.  I didn't know that big hair was still big.    So far on day two I'm still keeping to myself.  I guess I'm a loner.  I really did want to join my classmates when they were all laughing in the lounge during break, but I feel awkward.  I don't have much in common with these people yet.  Our conversations end at, "so where are you from?" and other such superficial statements.  Very frustrating for me.  I'm very shy, very self-conscious.    Distance and family obligations are going to prove a barrier for me in that area as well.  While other students can meet at the bar or in the library for a late night study group, I'm driving home, changing diapers, washing clothes, up with sick kids...  This afternoon we had a huge professionalism lecture.  We also went over things like writing goal/missin statements, facility and school philosophies, objectives, goals, etc.    In addition to that, we were divided up into our Cohort groups.  There are 4 per group, and this is who we'll work with for the rest of the semester on group projects.  We also practice skills and do labs with this group, as well as peer check-offs.  I think the only faculty check-offs we'll do will be vitals and enema/ostomy.  I've gone through at least 100 sheets of college rule paper already.  My handwriting is getting progressively worse.  Callouses are forming on my index finger.  My advice after 2 days:  buy stock in paper, black waterproof pens (not gel), highlighters....  It storms every afternoon here around 1:30.  Lightning, thunder, the works.  You'd think we were in the tropics.  Maybe it's an omen.  Regardless, a nice rainstorm always makes me want a nap...  A few questions.    What's the deal with the two terms patient and client?  Is one preferred as a general rule?  Our instructors seem to use both interchangeably.  Is there a secret to keeping sandwiches in a cooler from getting both mysteriously soggy and stale at the same time?  I had a nice soggy/stale ham and cheese sandwich for lunch, with some baby carrots, water, and a peppermint.  Now if only I could keep my diet so sensible in the evenings...  Anyone know a good program (PC based) for making and/or printing calendars?  I've got way too many things to keep track of, and each of our classes has individual calendars.  I'd like to streamline them all into one.  First quiz is tomorrow, first paper due Monday.  Need to get studying.  Got to go get Scantrons at the bookstore first thing in the morning before class.  We also have our first lab tomorrow: Universal Precautions.    Good night all, "see" you again this weekend.
