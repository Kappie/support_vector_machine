We have some people otherwise kow as "guests" staying at our house with their various kids. Some guy my dad went to college with..quite dull, along with the fact i must be a chilling person with them for the whole weekend. I went to the beach yesterday and saw a starfish. That'a about all i have to report...hey along with fireworks...those lil guys are very cool to shoot off and such..if you forgot. My favorites are sparklers of course ..all sparkley. Although i don't really know why any of these fire-ness' have to do with inderpedence day, besides the fact theat they look like bombs? how joyful eh? hey well the ranting has begun and now it has stopped.   hey i bet you thought i was going to end there BUT I DIDN'T! see ya lates
