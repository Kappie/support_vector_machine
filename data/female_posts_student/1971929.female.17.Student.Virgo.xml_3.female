The intention was that I go have dinner at his house upon the request of his mother. For some reason unbeknownst to me, the little jackass didn't call. Not only that, but when I called, no one answered the phone. Obvioulsy, something is awry here, and it's not making me too happy. In fact, I'm pretty pissed right now. Yesterday, he said he would call me, but he didn't. And when I called him, he wasn't home. Of course, he got home eventually, but somehow found it unnecessary to call me. Bastard. I hardly ate anything at the crawfish boil I went to this afternoon, and I left there early so I'd have enough time to get home with enough spare time to primp myself more than usual. I even went out and bought something special to wear to dinner tonight, but nooooooo, Lucas doesn't even call me. I'm so mad at him. Wouldn't you know my luck? The day after I start this blog announcing that I love the moron, he dumps me. I can see it happening. Guess I'll just report back tomorrow with the news. I hope the rest of the world had a better day than I did.
