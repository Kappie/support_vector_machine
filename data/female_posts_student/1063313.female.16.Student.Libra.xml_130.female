it sucks to be 3 states over.. i feel so left out of everything. nothing interesting happens when i'm there, it all happens when i'm gone! what's up with that?! christmas is day after tomorrow! that would make today christmas eve eve. lol and my PB balls are slowly going away, and the cat is under the christmas tree (when she gets under there the whole tree shakes) and my mom said she doesnt know why she's under the tree cause there's no presents under there for her. anyways, my cd player's batteries are going dead. and after they die, then i too will be bored. okay byeee
