(mostly you, megan.)   "Once you can accept the universe as matter expanding into nothing that is something, wearing stripes with plaid comes easy."  "People who never get carried away should be."  "The shortest distance between two points is under construction."  "Common sense and a sense of humor are the same thing, moving at different speeds. A sense of humor is just common sense, dancing."  "Wait, I just remembered something! You're boring and my legs work."  "Time is what keeps everything from happening at once"  "Never take life seriously. Nobody gets out alive anyway."  "Procrastinate later."  "Never put off till tomorrow what you can avoid altogether"  "The mind is like a parachute; it works much better when it's open."   "One should respect public opinion in so far as is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny."       â€“Russell  and here's a few that i even got myself! imagine... (all from awesome songs, by the way)  "and when i say 'let's keep in touch, i hope you know that i really mean 'i wish that you'd just grow up'." "What difference does this difference in age make? i know how it ends...so kill me quick." [ how i feel about natey-boy] "if you ever said you missed me then don't say you never lied." "this night is hell. i'm sick and sunk and i blame myself, cause i was making things hard and you were just trying to help."  all those songs came from the CD "your favorite weapon" by the awesome band "brand new".  now i'm morbidly bored and no one is home...i would call frankie, but i'm not letting myself contact him...he is going to come get me.   nate was lifeguarding today and he walked in while i was leaving. he nodded at me and asked if i'd done anything (eye brow raise) exciting yet this summer. K:"plenty, but none like you're thinking." N:"we could change that." grin. " call me if you're bored and i'll find something for you to do." K:"i'll remember that." smile. "see ya" N:"tchus." and then i let him check me out as i walked out to the parking lot and then turned my head and smiled at him. i love that kid so much. i'm thinking we'll go to prom together this year. excellent! what do you think, meike? just think, if we get married, we'll be katie  nate! sigh...okay, i promise i won't say or type any of those thoughts out loud anymore. i'll keep them to myself. but when he said "if you're bored" i doubt he meant TONIGHT.  i would call you, meike, but you're apparently in colorado or someplace that isn't oklahoma (lucky). it is going to be so freaking awesome sophomore year! you and i can reign over deutsch club and we will finally be like all the other clubs: 1. homecoming float 2. actual event turn-outs 3. FIELD TRIPS during school 4. after school 5. best trip to germany EVER 6. 2 whole pages in the freaking yearbook instead of one. i promise to try and get a picture of just the officers in there!  note to self: talk frau hill into GIVING us the positions of prez  VP because we are the only 2 (of 4...hehehe) who show up to EVERYTHING. even if frau doesn't. and besides, she adores us! but i'm thinking about putting a hit on that emily girl because she won the award and i didn't. of cours tanya did. and you. i hate you, meike von detton! jk, you're my second in command. (like hemler to hitler.)(lol, sorry! couldn't help sticking that reference in there!) (ps- kinda random, but my grandfather (the one whose belly button popped off) killed hemler when he was a sniper during WWII and it was raining so hemmy went to put the top down on his convertible and gramps shot the bastard. just so you know.)
