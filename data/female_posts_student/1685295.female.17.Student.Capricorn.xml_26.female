The cable guy came like two hours ago and set it up and he had to replace the cable wiring, not only in my own house, but also in my building's roof. the connection in my house was fried it was like breakfast gone wrong. Anyway I used for the first time like ten minutes ago and it wasn't a slice of Heaven, but the entire cake. Ummm...anyway its Starcraft time, so peace out.
