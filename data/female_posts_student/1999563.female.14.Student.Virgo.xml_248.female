First you have to be a superchick freak, if not- need no apply ;)  Its on Feburary 11 (Wednesday) at the Roseland Theatre in Portland, it starts at 7 PM, and you can get tickets here: http://www.itickets.com/events/66447.html  and a bunch more information is on that page.  Since, like I said, I am a Superchic[k] freak so I will probably be there at around 3 or 4. :)  I am bringing cookies!  So please tell me if your going or if you need a ride or something. :)   This will be my seventh superchick conert so lets MAKE it GOOOOD!
