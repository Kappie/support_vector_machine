Math class... rather okay for once, we're learning Logrithms and I actually understand it so far.. so hooray for that... exponential laws are probably the only thing I retained from grade 10.  Spanish..... darn Sperling is at a rock concert in California!!! Why couldn't he take the class with him? No no.. instead he stuck us with a mean sub and made us do an exam..... which I doubt I did so hot on... but you never know...  Then I went home for lunch (Wednesdays and Fridays sport the all lovely 2 classes - spare - lunch - spare - 1 class rhythm) and I called Joyce from GMC and asked about where my portfolio is (I e-mailed it in and my Cr.Wr teacher heard that GMC's e-mail program bombed last week..) soooooo the good news: She has my portfolio, and after explaining my situation She said She'll push it up towards the top for grading, estimating I should have an answer in a week. Bad news: This means I have to actually make a decision about MHC..... (unless they decide they hate my writing.. I will seriously die if that happens)  Making a decision on MHC just keeps getting harder and harder and harder..... but I should be going down May 7th-ish to tour the campus and check out the student residence. I get to shadow a student and all that jazz... hooray?? I was leaning to MHC before but now I don't know again...  So that was my lunchour... came back for English class which was okay, not great, not bad either.  Then I wrote my Trig 2 exam I've been waiting to do for the last month.  And I BOMBED!  Seriously... I'm expecting 12%....... definitely lower than 50.. I didn't even answer the last 2 pages....... my mind just went blank...... nada... couldn't think of anything.........oh well... I'll.... make up for it on the Logrithm test or something.
