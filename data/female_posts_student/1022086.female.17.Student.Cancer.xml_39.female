Frozen Goat, maybe? I do believe that the name is something along those lines) and you will know what I'm talking about. Additionally, the smoothies have this empowering stuff that really gives an energy burst. I had even more trouble than usual sitting still at rehearsal yesterday. The main point I'm trying to convey here is that THOSE THINGS ARE SO GOOD!!!  SAT this morning... *shakes head*  Definitely retesting. Need I say more? I didn't think so, either.    Uhm. Yeah. Too much rehearsal everywhere lately *shoots self*.       I greatly thank all ye folks who are always there for me and prevent my chasing of school buses, my perdition in high school parking lots (which can be quite distressing), and my drowning in mere glasses of water. I love you!    Honorary quote: "Si! Si! Feo gato!! Gato feo! Si!!" --Philip, referring to the newly created aluminum foil turtle.
