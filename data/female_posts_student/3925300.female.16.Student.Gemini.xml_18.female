I stayed on the comp late last nigth but i was the only one who culdnt be brought down it was like i was on some kinda high. Jonah is on vacation Phillip I hope everything ok muahs   v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v The say the world is round, and yet I often think its square So many little hruts we get From corners here and there. There's one thing true in life I've found While journeying east and west, The only folk we really would Are those we love the best   The Choicest garb , the sweetest grace, Are oft to strangers shown; The careless word, the frowning face, Are given to our own. We flatter those we scarcly know, We please the fleeting guest, And deal full many a thoughtful blow To those we love the best  Ella Wheeler Wilcox
