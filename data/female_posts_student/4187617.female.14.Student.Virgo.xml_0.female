Anyway I have this friend who's kind of in a ruff spot right now..... This friend is getting in a lot of trouble and I think its kind of my fault ,but friend assures my its not so I guess ill believe that!!!! But the other day at my school I was getting "harassed" about shit I don't know much about then the next day I go back and was called a liar for telling a lie that I didn't even know was a lie!!!! GAY!!!!!! Any way....The friend that got in trouble happens to be my crush!!!!! Now I don't know what is going to happen and things really suck !!!!! IM hoping things get better but with my luck they wont!!!!!
