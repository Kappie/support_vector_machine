Yesterday I pretty much just chilled, and I talked to an old friend which..probably wasn't such a great idea. If bill found out he'd kill me..but it all happened by mistake to begin with. Oh well...anyhow so I talked to him. We used to like eachother and now his feelings are back. I kind of feel bad..I dont like him anymore, but he's a cool friend. He listened to me talk, and cry...and I felt weird because I've never personally met him. We met through other friends and he lives about an hour or so away.   Anyway...Tomorrow my mom and I are going to watch a little girl named Autumn which is such a beautiful name. *FROM AUTUMN TO ASHES* hehe...sorry, that was random..great band anyway...but Autumn is two. Tuesday Bill and my mom and I are going to watch Zachary hehe.. Which is awesome. I love Zachary so much. Bill put him to sleep tonight and was singing to him when he was crying and he got all better, and it made me want a baby more because he'd be a great father.   I've been thinking about *you* a lot lately...A lot of the times when Im with Bill. I feel bad saying that..I doubt that you even read these anymore..I wouldn't blame you if you didnt. I've been such a shit head and stuff. I haven't talked to Bill about letting us talk, I guess I've been avoiding it because I know how it is all going to turn out. Oh well..anyhow..*sigh*..  I just wrote a whole thing..but didnt want to post it. :-/, Im going to go now....bye bye
