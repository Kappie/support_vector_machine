Yay. I can watch T.V, do my homework or ne thing really! So it means I wont be on Msn much on a Monday any more cause I wont have time! Also I will find out on Wednesday whether I will have a job, hopefully I will cause I need some money! I am also enjoying Karate at the moment as its really good, although it does leaves you with aching legs for a couple of days after cause they make you do stretching for like 10 mins and it really hurts! But now I can touch my toes and before I went I couldn't touch them, so at least I have learnt something. I will also be starting my first Kata, this is the moves I need to pass for yellow belt, which I will be taking in something like 3 months! Yay Trampolining is also going well, I am starting to learn how to do a backwards somersault as I can now do a front somersault and a front piked somersault! My sister was home again this weekend from Uni, although she didn't spend much of it actually at home, she was out with her mates for most of the time! I think she spent apporx 3 hours actually at home not including sleeping! LOL unfortunately she has to leave at like 3 on a Sunday cause it takes like 5 or 6 hours to get back, this time she was getting driven back so she didn't have to get a number of trains and buses! I am looking forward to the sponsored walk, i don't know why as I'm gonna be knackered afterwards as I'm actually walking the thing instead of helping out! Oh yea does anyone want to sponsor me? You don't have to cause i already got a few but you can if you want to. HEHE
