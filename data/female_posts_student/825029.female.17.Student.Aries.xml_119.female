Aside from being sick last weekend and the beginning of this week, school has just been extra sucky.  I’m so dependent on my weekends!  And of course this weekend has to be region band… and of course I have to HATE the music.  It’s absolutely terrible—super easy, and I just don’t like any of it.  I haven’t heard anything positive about the honor band’s music either, though… so looks like none of us got lucky.  At least there’s a 3-day weekend, and then a 3-day week, and then another 3-day weekend!  That’s really cool.  I’m going to be on a church retreat next weekend with Becca, though.  Should be fun… it’s for confirmation which I’m really looking forward to.  I’m not sure why; maybe it’s because this is the first time that I can actually say that I’m a Catholic, not because my parents want me to be, but because I want to be.  That means a lot to me- kind of a self-affirmation that I’m doing this for me and not for anybody else.  Anyhoo, Race Coppell 2003 is coming up!  Good luck to all you racers out there.  And sorry people, I’m already someone else’s shotgun (I know, I know… maybe next time!)  Countdown to my birthday (for all you early shoppers out there): 73 days.  Yep, you’ve still got a long while… I just want it to come faster and so maybe putting a countdown will help.  (Yeah right.)  Cool song alert! System of a Down’s version of Black Sabbath’s “Snowblind” - you should check it out!  Another cool song alert (omg how exciting)!  Foo Fighters - “Lonely as You” … actually, the entire “One by One” album deserves it’s own cool alert.  Hey, you should email me sometime.  Yes, you!  lissame5732@hotmail.com.  Add it to your address book right now.  I mean,  right now .  Stop dillydallying.  Holy crap, dillydallying is a word!  I’m typing this in MS Word and there’s no squiggly red line underneath it!  Woahhhhh… dillydallying dillydallying dillydallying dillydallying.  That’s too cool!  So yeah, back to what I was saying.  You should email me.  I don’t care if you have nothing to say and just tell me what color your socks are.  That’s good enough.  I’m very low maintenance.  So really… go on and email me.  Now. *threatening look*  Wellllll, I’m afraid that’s all for today’s update.  Maybe I’ll have one within the next week or so; maybe even tomorrow!  Nah… I don’t think you’ll be that lucky.    Oh yeah, I’m taking a poll- Should I fill out the survey that’s also displayed on Becca’s, Collin’s, and Habibi’s blogs?  (Well, Habibi’s “non-blog”.)  Just tell me yes or no.  Hey, that’s something for you to email me about!  That’s right – just email me a simple yes or no and we’ll both be happy!  OK, I’ve reached the second page in my Word document, so that’s enough bloggage for one entry.  Bye bye!
