Instead I laid on the couch under a really soft blanket and watched a marathon of Road Rules people battling it out with Real World people.  They did such crazy things as leap of of a 20 foot platform to catch a rope suspended from a holicopter and climb it (all done over water so they would have a chance of surviving the inevitable fall) and then fight over the fact that someone gave up and didn't try.  My day was officially wasted and all I feel like doing is lying down and sleeping away all memory of it.  Something about being home in the middle of a week day makes me sluggish, I hate it.
