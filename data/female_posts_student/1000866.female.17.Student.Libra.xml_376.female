We wanted to hang out with him but we couldn't get a hold of him and we both forgot his cell phone number. I NEVER will again. But anyywayyy, we finally managed to track him down, and we met up with him and Steve and Matthew after they came back from the concert. We went to McDonalds and then to Ranchview. It was just a lot of fun. I got a chance to talk to Bryan which was really nice, and I'd never hung out with Steve before so it was cool!   Marching earlier today was ok. I mean, I don't know. I guess it was kind of cool being on the radio, but right now I'm being really optimistic about everything so....catch me when I'm in a bad mood and I'll say it sucked like no other.   But, right now I'm really incredibly tired and I have to do my homework and finish clearing out my room so my brother can paint it tomorrow. Woo woo. I'm in such a fantastic mood right now. I looove it! :)
