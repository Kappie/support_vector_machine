"longer! more! bigger! better!" the editors would say. if you're asking, it seemed a bit yellow to me. why sensationalize a bryan city counsel meeting? it's what it is: a boring bunch of greying white guys who like to feel important. and oh yeah, the perky city secretary. :)  just kidding.  the city secretary wasn't all that perky. nice, but not perky.
