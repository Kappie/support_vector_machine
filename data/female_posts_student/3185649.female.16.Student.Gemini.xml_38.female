This is the first sentence of the book  Come Away My Beloved  by Frances J. Roberts. When I read it, I almost started crying. Everyone's always told me that God knows exactly what I'm going through in every situation because he lived on the Earth andwent through the wholehuman experiencefirsthand. But in my ignorance, I always sort of doubted somewhere in my mind that he knew what it was like to feel unrequited love, to know what it's like to be rejected by the object of your affection for whatever reason. Looking at it now it seems so  stupid.  Of  course  he knows what that's like. I do it to him  all the time.  We  all  do. He loves every single one of us so intimately and so dearly, but half the time we're off doing our own thing in our own little world. He loved us so much that he  died  for us, and any pain I ever went through because of a guy not liking me back is absolutely insignificant compared to the pain that Jesus goes through every single timewe turn away from him, indifferent.    He  knows.
