Yesterday was the busiest day. Today was the sane as I had three functions back to back. Tonight is formal night again and I get to wear my new dress! Exciting! I bought it at Macy's yesterday when i went out to port. (San Diego).    Things are going well as usual. We had a bunch of crew disembark yesterday. One girl from the Spa got fired because she was coming to work drunk everyday. (Like 9AM in the morning on one day).  Pretty sad stuff.  Another guy got kicked off because he tested positive for drugs. Not sure what kind though. I just pretend there aren't any better - the less I know the better. My friend Fotis invited me and Lisa to visit him in Greece over vacation. He has a big summer house there and he said he invites all his friends for two week to vacation there. Sounds like fun. He's such a nice guy. I don't know if I will go but it was very nice of him to offer.   Lisa is well again so finally I feel like I have my half back. She's so cool. We just laugh so much and since her desk is right near my office we talk to each other all day. It's funny, when we eat in the officer's mess, we are usually the two loudest people just rolling on the floor cracking up.  She's fun. Glad she didn't give me her norwalk yuckness.   I am over my sea sickness which is good. Tomorrow is CABO and finally a day to relax.  Lisa and I and a few other girls are taking over to the beach tomorrow to get some sun and play. It's the only time when we feel like we have a day off and most of the time we are still working in the evening once we come back onboard.    Must run. Get ready for formal night. Much love to my homies, mommies  my girl.
