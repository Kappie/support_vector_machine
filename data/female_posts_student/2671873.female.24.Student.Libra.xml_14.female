I went to Dublin for a basket ball tournament...more like a drinking marathon...and we got slaughtered by Trinity, however we had fun and some how in the last 2 minutes managed to play on the court with 6 players and didn't get called.  I like basket ball a lot more here....its less serious than in the states.  Our men's team won the plate (of the losers bracket) but that is great since Magee never wins ANYTHING!!! Now I am back for 5 days and will work 3 of them, have to write a paper, train for my marathon, and get ready to leave for Belgium on Saturday at 4am.    I will be in Belgium for a week hob nobbing with the likes of EU politicians and visiting NATO, not to mention visiting a concentration camp and other historical areas.  Speaking of hob nobbing...I was able to meet the Prime Minister of Ireland (and the current EU president), Bertie Ahern and Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume last week when Mr. Ahern came and talked to the college about Peace within the EU.  So life has been full to say the least.  Now on to my real tangent.  I went out last night (it was the international students night in the union) and then after the union closed went home and got ready for bed....now by the time I finally get into my bed its 2am and suddenly the phone rings.  Its this boy who I haven't seen or talked to in weeks...I kissed him once but that was months ago.  So I get this call from this boy and he asks what I am up to and if I want to meet up later....WHAT....I AM IN BED.....NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET UP!!!!  So I just go back to sleep after telling him I am home in my bed.  Then this morning I wake up to 3 text messages, and a missed call!  Sheesh talk about a hard core booty call....what is with this people.  Boys...don't you understand?!?!?  You can't call a girl randomly after not talking for weeks and expect that she will jump at the chance to hook up with you!  It just doesn't work that way! And if it does for some girls they should be shot....Late night random booty calls are ok....but not when they are out of the blue.  Sheesh....  Ok. Tangent over.  Discuss.
