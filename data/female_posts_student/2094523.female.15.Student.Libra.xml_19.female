The question should be ever  not  have ona those days coz i have that practically everyday. its just the stupid ass shit people do and say, the arrogance of everyone and the self absorbness. what do they want from me when they tell me shit? sympathy? coz I have none of that to give away. yah i know a "good" friend is suppose to be there for their friends at all times but sometimes when no ones ever there for u..why should u be there for them?
