Idk, she was cool though, and gave us someone to talk to though.  Then we got picked up (stupid rules about minors flyin alone... I hate having somone watch over me all the time.  I'm 17, I don't need a babysitter to get on and off an airplane)  We went to Planet Hollywood for lunch... came back to the timeshare, sat around, then went to Super Wal-mart for groceries and whatnot.  I got elastic cord so I could finish my anklet.  It's really cute :)  Today Kait and I are just lounging around while dad's at work.  Eating, watching TV... meh.  Anyway, I'll update my blog as much as possible while I'm here, two or three more times this week.   I love you all!!  I miss you Bethy and Pookie and Ken!  And Bethy, you HAVE to call me after the party and tell me how everything goes!  You should call me during the party too, if possible.  I won't be able to talk long,but...  Anyway, gotta log off, later!!!
