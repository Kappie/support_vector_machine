Beauty queen of only eighteen   She had some trouble with herself   He was always there to help her   She always belonged to someone else   I drove for miles and miles   And wound up at your door   I've had you so many times but somehow   I want more   I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved   She will be loved   Tap on my window knock on my door   I want to make you feel beautiful   I know I tend to get insecure   It doesn't matter anymore   It's not always rainbows and butterflies   It's compromise that moves us along   My heart is full and my door's always open   You can come anytime you want   I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved   She will be loved   I know where you hide   Alone in your car   Know all of the things that make you who you are   I know that goodbye means nothing at all   Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls   ...        yeaa..wow. Maroon 5- "She will be loved" great song.    anyway, babe, I Love You. I am reall sorry about yesterday, after we had gotten off the phone I thought that we weren't going to be able to talk so I went to my godmom's house to say bye to her and then came back at 10:30..I'm so sorry, shit, I shouldve stayed home..damn, from what it sounded like on tha phone, I thought we werent gonna be able to talk fo a long time.    I dont know if it's ok to call today, but Imma call anyway cuz my cousins are coming over for dinner..and you said you were gonna drop your mom off at the airport at around 7 (??)..yeaa.    today, my dad went over my SAT with me, and I got some math problems wrong..that was the worst morning I have ever had. I dont think I have heard anyone say Stupid that many times. Its like..ok I'm sorry if I don't remember a formula or one thing...thats kind of why I'm practicing so that I can memorize more of what I need to so that I can do well on the SAT.    whatever.        tomorrow I'm going to the gurduwara from 6:30-9:30pm. my parents might be going to a banquet so me and my massi will go with Harneet.
