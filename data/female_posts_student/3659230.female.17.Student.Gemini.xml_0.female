You like having things your way, and if you don't get what want you are not happy because of this, you can be manipulative at times and or annoying. I have lots of fun insulting you, and making fun of little mistakes or things that happen to you.  JP. But you can be really clumsy and unorganized.  Oh yeah.  You sometimes don't act like yourself.  Ok enough of the negative cause the list can go on forever (joking)-not really.  You speak what is on your mind, you are not afraid to against the norm.  You can be a very determined person at times.  You are a very open person and you like meeting new people. You always look at the bright side, you are very optimistic.
