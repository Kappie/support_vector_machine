So yea, that Art dudeon channel 5 is freakin tall. I was likewow.And the Scott dude was cool. He was talkin to us bouthow he slept through his alarm that morning and that he gets up at 2 AM.I was like I admire you're...earliness. And he talked to us bout how he was in drama n chorus or maybe it was just drama inhs.He's a cool kid. Anywho, leaving,there were theselittle girls in the van on our way back from STL who WOULDN'T SHUT UP. I swear...they must be morning ppl cuz they were wired. If their mom wasn't the one driving I was gonna yell "Shut the F up or else I'm gonna tape your mouths shut w/ duct tape that I don't have! GRRR!" Knowing them, they'd keep goin n I would have to go to some extremity...*sigh* I'm goin back to bed...
