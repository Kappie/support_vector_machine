Then the deadline got pushed forward a day, so we had more time.  Then we discovered that there wasn't any of our recorded sound that couild be heard.  Then we came up with the idea of subtitling and using mood music.  SO basically, it's got awesome music (Gary Jules' cover of "Mad World," REM's "Endgame", and a really cool techno remix of the "I Dream of Jeannie" theme) and then these cool subtitles, which make sup for the stumbling actors. IT really looks good. I'm excited beyond your mom's pocketbook, or something to that effect.  I think it'll change the way one or two ppl think about neuroses. I also think it'll make a high school Theory of Knowledge class fall out of their chairs with its comic genius.  Woot for history!
