The service was very nice, only 25 minutes and it went very well.  I hung out on and off with MK and the Bell children and Chad and his mom and sis.  Jamie, bless her heart, MEANT to come at 6:30... but didn't wake up till 7:45.. when i called her.  So she came to the service late and sat w/ Chad and his family and I.  Cindy, Nikki, and Chad have turned into my adoptive church family... because my parents are never at church when i am!!! oh well, it's fun, and i prolly wouldn't sit with them anyway... but it's the principle of the thing!!!!   Some people need to loosen up... like... all the church elders and deacons who glare at us for clapping during contemporary worship songs... HELLO!!! IT'S EASTER, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REJOICING!!!  Jenny gets 5 million points for starting the clapping during the flowering of the cross!!  It was quite fun.  For brunch, we went to  C J Callaways Easter brunch.. it was SOOOOOOO yummy oooo and they had shrimp and crab claws.. i was in heaven.  After doing some homework, i went to Carrie's to watch The Majestic... movie watching at Carrie's has greatly deteriorated into a critical bashing of every aspect of every movie ever watched.  Then the regular round of death ball, which i believe i lost... but hey by then i was super tired anyway.  so i went home.  Today is deemed homework day.  This was a really boring post... but then i'm in a really dull mood.
