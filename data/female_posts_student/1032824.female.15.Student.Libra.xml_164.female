My parents think I look good in the photograph though, fierce-looking and all. Hohoho. There are more photos from Yati's blog and I think Val and Xiongster still has somemore in their Digital cameras. I'll wait for them to send me some of the photos before uploading them. Speech Day is in less than a week's time and I'm totally exhilarated! Everyone went hysterical when they put on their No.1 Us during the previous training because it feels different when you have it on. It boosts the morale of the contingent and the best thing about it is that, it is an  honour , to be able to put it on.  Anyways, I haven't began studying for my Chinese mid-yrs which is in about 3 weeks time! Gosh am I dead or what. Mdm Liu Jian expects me to get an A1 when I targetted for an A2. I feel that it would already be rather difficult to score an A2 because my chinese composition writing is not strong enough. On the other hand, nothing is impossible. Results only come after hard hard work. Endure guys! :) *Cheers!
