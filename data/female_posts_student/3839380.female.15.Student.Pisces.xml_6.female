Today I went to A for breakfast --> Sunridge mall, shopping --> Marlborough mall, shopping --> Filipino store, food --> Church, didn't fall asleep this time --> Dropped of my grandma, shes slow --> Beddington mall, doctors --> and now i am home. updating this. lol, when i should really really start playing some video games. yep. Blah. I have little time to play some video games because I have to sleep early tonight because I am going to the stampede tomorrow! Lol, and every year, as always, I'm going to watch the Dog Show again. I ALWAYS watch the dog show. It sucks because I'm allergic to dogs, but the dogs are all the way down there, but still. In the past 2 days, I've got 3 games. So i better get 'gaming' HA! Blah blah blah blah blah! Fin.
