I could really use you to just hold me and tell me I'm not alone in this world, that I'm making the right decisions, that you know I don't mean to hurt people like my mom who thinks that I'm moving to another state to get away from her. I have to be strong and I think I can be. Sometimes you have to do things for yourself, right? I know that I have been all of my life, but this time it counts. And I think some parents just have a hard time letting go, especially when they think that you shouldn't have to let go. But you do, in my mind, and so there I go.  Yet, you aren't here to hold me. Am I completely insane? People will call this mush and wishful thinking and weakness, but on the contrary, I think it is breathtakingly noble and brave to even want the union of souls. I think it is godliness. Optimism. And faith in humanity.  So, my defense down . . .  If you were here, I wouldn't feel as alone as I am making myself be. I don't know how to act. If I could only follow how God would treat people, but I'm no good at that. But I'll try. Anyway, I love you and want you and know you before I know you. Screw all the world that points out the obvious, because I know you exist and I want to say these things now. Belonging to someone is maybe one of the few chances of happiness we have in the world because it so intimately involves love.  I'm a scared little girl or some kind of woman or a human being. So I am worth something. He said that I was, and I believe Him.   To anyone reading this . . . that means that you are worth something too.
