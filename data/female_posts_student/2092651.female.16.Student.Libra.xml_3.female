It was such a sneaky little thing to do to watch that video when I was 8 years old. But even then, the black and white, the perfect chords and melody, and the gorgeous presentation of the model's body. I'm not a lesbian myself or bisexual in anyway, I just know a nice female body when I see one. They did not do it in an untasteful manner, but very classy. I like. I'm putting this song on repeat...
