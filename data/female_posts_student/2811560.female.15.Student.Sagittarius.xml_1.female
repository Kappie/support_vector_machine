Then Jasmine came over around 3 to watch the Cavaliers DVD John let me borrow. That was fun. Their 2000 show is so good, its ridiculous. Seriously, we watched like 5 times because it was so awesome. Then we called Emily to see if she wanted to do anything, but she wasn't home, so whatever. Jasmine and I then decided to aimlessly walk the streets of Bloomingdale and somehow ended up at the McDonald's by the mall. So we ate and went home. Yeah and then I watched like 5 episodes of Law and Order. And so here I am. Bored and tired. Ugh, yucky. Tomorrow I'm being forced to go to lunch with my grandparents. They're going to Italy on Tuesday. They always go to really random places at really random times. Whatever. I'll have to do something tomorrow or else I think I will go insane.
