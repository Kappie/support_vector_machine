So finals were blah. i was just like "let me outta here" all week. none of them were spectacularly hard. maybe cause i didnt have euro. hardest tests ive ever taken were in euro. crazy euro.      wednesday after school heather and michele and i had lunch at Fridays with our cute, nice waiter dude who we talked about the whole time afterwards and then we went to Oberweis (or however you spell it) for ice cream and then my mommy picked us up and i almost broke her keys and she got mad but its all okay now.      8th grade graduation was cute but kind of a waste of time cause i needed to be studying for chem. I was annoyed by the talkative people in front and behind me. And andrew got in big trouble for causing a scene. which was amusing i guess. And i got to see Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Julis and Mrs. Hayna. that was kind of fun. Aw, woodlawn... i had some great times there.      On thursday i had chem and spanish and chem wasnt murder, but wasnt easy, and spanish, of course, was a joke. I had excruciating cramps though...which made me really angry and made it hard to take the finals...so hard i had to go to the nurse during spanish and lie down for 20 minutes then come back and finish the final. the lying down helped a lot, actually. i was so pissed at my body for giving me inconvenient pain on my last final of the year though. bah.       Lets see...then i came home and called emily to ask her what was up with this saxophone business... and then i went to the mall... and i got some candy and a cool harry potter shirt to wear to the movie last night (albeit from Hot Topic...ewww...but harry potter. so appropriate i just had to live with the fact that it was from hot topic). and..."The Bell Jar" which i intend to read at some point...and...i thought at least one other thing but i forget. Then i came home and slept and then i went to marthas.      Martha's party was fun...got some nice time talking to people (especially emily...though i still like it better when its just me and her) and some good laughs and a fun harry potter wand which i can now not find. :'(. And we saw harry potter at midnight and it was AWESOME! i loved it. i thought it was amazing. better than the first 2. i like the new director. it had some cool moments. And now i totally wish i went to hogwarts and had a robe and all... and i really want to be a harry potter character for halloween. im thinking of going for a slytherin house member witch person. cause i dont want to be hermoine or however you spell her name. and i dont want to be a gryfindor house person cause gryfindor is the house everybody loves cause its harrys house... and i dont want to be ravenclaw or hufflepuff cause nobody cares about those loser houses...therefore, even though it is a tad evil, i think i shall be a slytherin girl. Like with a Harry Potter (R) Slytherin House Robe costume... if they sell those... i wonder if i fit in child sizes? hmmm...i could try. And i totally want a green and silver tie. And theres this cool place online that sells harry potter patches... and i want a slythin house crest thing to put on whatever shirt im gonna wear under my cloak... and i want a harry potter student hat. and...and...and... aw, thats gonna be so much money. oh well. remind me, guys, that i wanna be a slytherin for halloween. (sorry if ive been spelling syltherin wrong this whole time but i dont feel like looking it up and slytherine looks funny and thats the only other spelling i can conjure, so deal with it)      And emily woudlnt stay up late to talk with me, but its okay, i guess, theres pleanty of time for that later this summer.   And...today i came home and slept and looked at harry potter merchandise on the internet and watched Batman and galled liz to find out whats up with this party on tuesday. and... hmm...i dunno.   i gotta figure out if emily'll sleep over next weekend and when her engineering thing is and all this other stuff for planning my fantastic mr. fox summer. and the field museum and brookfiled zoo and churches and 6 flags and more sleepovers and the park and fireflies and... and..  i also intend to buy the harry potter soundtrack. to either the first or secnd film. not hte 3rd though, it was good, but hte music was somewhat unimpressive. so it should say a lot htat i liked the second one even if the music wasnt amazing to me, as amazing music is something i find key in a good movie.   and now im gonna go see if they have slytherin key chains...  muh ha ha ha ha ha ha.  i go for my driving test on monday. watch out.  i am happy. :-)  ITS SUMMER!
