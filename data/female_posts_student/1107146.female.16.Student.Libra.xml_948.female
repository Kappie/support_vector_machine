Who knows what's happening.  Anyway, please say a prayer for my parents' good friend, Christy Stickney.  She has leukemia and just got a bronchial infection (which, most of you [except Z] probably don't know, totally lowers your immune system because leukemia attacks your blood cells and bone marrow.)  They were going to do a bone marrow transplant, but now she's so weak they can't do it.  She's probably not going to be with us much longer.  And that's about it for me.  All I do now is sleep.  On the bright side though, I have lost about eight pounds in a little less than a week.  Can't complain too much about that, now can I?  The best part though, is that I have a bet going on with my mother to see who can lose ten pounds the fastest.  I win!!!  Bad thing though, is that she'll probably say the bet is off cause I cheated by getting sick.  So, yall have a good weekend.  See you sometime in February I hope.  Probably can't go to my HUGE forensics tournament in Gatlinburg, which REALLY PISSES ME OFF, but I'm getting over it.  Slowly.  Rosie, have a good time at Mystery dinner tomorrow night.  And Elizabeth, I hear you're sick so GET BETTER OR CALL ME!!!  There's no excuse for lying in that bed bored when your best friend is at home in the same condition!!!  I'll call you tomorrow afternoon, though.  Hope to hear from yall soon, and yall BETTER HAVE A DI MEETING BEFORE I COME BACK!!!!  And Will, I'm expecting you [and Sarah] to organize and lead that, because you're the only ones who have done this before.  Anyway, I really am leaving now.  I'll let you know what the doctors say if you want to know.  Bye.
