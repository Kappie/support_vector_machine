I think this is one of the first times I've slept on the bus ride both there and back. I have no life or something. We got a II at districts. Oh well, we could've done worse. Now I just want to go to bed.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! WHEN WILL THIS COME!?!?!?!?!? Please God, please, please, please, come soon. I need it more than ever. Please.
