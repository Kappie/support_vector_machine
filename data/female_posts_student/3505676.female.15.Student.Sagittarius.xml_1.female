Either way, summer so far has been really fun [[I listened to big boy's advice--Might as well have fun now 'Cause your happiness is done and your goose is cooked]] My summer thus far for my own benefit: Thursday- Cheered up through the delicious mega veggie pizza at mellow mushroom with Jana and her Mom, followed by movies and fun @ Jana's! Friday- Lazy day at first *w/ uh...some nice television shows* and then rescued by BRAD! who btw, had the convertible and Jana was extremely happy about that! Went with Brittney to her pool [giraffe and leech attack!] Out to subway, then to the movies with all my new "senior" buddies! Hurray for being a sophmore *lol* Quickie to see Maggie, then back to jana's..then home! Saturday- Jill's graduation, familly time, then out to dinner!  I love food..gawd i love food! Sunday- Brad and Lee to the rescue again! Headed over to jen's where brad proceeded to attack her kitchen, then went to see Raising helen with jen, maggie, her sisters, kenzie, and brad, while lee picked up jana, ricky, and laney.  The movie was pretty good...probably due to the gobstoppers i was consuming. Then we went and played a round of laser tag because it was thundering, then to the pool! It was a blast! My summer would be sorely lacking w/o them! Kenzie left, then we grabbed some munchies *thanks for the ring brad* and watched Grease at Jen's + I was home @ 11--perfect.  and that's my summer! haha felt the need to write about it cuz it's bound to go downhill from here!
