Right now, I'm stitting on his couch listening to the music outside.  Their having a block party, and it's LOULD!!!!  Earlier this afternoon, they had a barbacue.  The music has been going on for about 5 hours so far. and Mike (my brother) said that these things usally starte dying down around 1am.  There were some pretty cute guys outside his apartment earlier.  I'm thinking about maybe going out and dancing later.  Who knows...  Anyways, we saw the funniest thing earlier.  There was a group of motercycleists all riding together, and we noticed that they each had a seperate helmet strapped on to their back seat.  My brother made a crack about how they were probally for the ladies that they were trying to pick up, although none of them hade seemed to accomplished that yet...  Oh well.  It was still early...    All today, my parents have been complete crabs.  They were bitching at me all day about everything.  They are completely anal too!  I mean, I realize that they haven't slept in a while, but it's not like it's my fault, so why take it out on me?!?!?!  Gesh.  Parents...  What can u do?  Lol.  I suppose that I'm gonna go outside now.  Their playing some good R right now, and I actually reconize some of the songs.  Their's a DJ and everything.  The mixer alone has to be a couple thousand...  Why dont' they spend their money on something more productive?  Well, if having fun means that much, who am I to argue?  Besides, I'm benifiting from it all, so who's complaning?   Later,  Ani
