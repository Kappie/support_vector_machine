I just told you what I felt, and I don't know what it was like between you and James, and I don't know what it's like between you and Anthony. For all I know it could be the same thing. You act on the outside the same, you don't always let me in to know what you truely are thinking or feeling. With James, as you stated, you always said I miss James, and maybe you were just trying to convince yourself that, but I didn't know that, and it fooled me the first time, so how was I to know that it just wasn't fooling me this time too. I was just concerned about you, that's all. I just want you too know that. I don't want you to get hurt again. I am sooo sorry, like more than you can imagine for saying what I did, I only want you to be aware of everything unlike you were before. So my  DEEPEST  apologies! I am  truely  sorry. If there's anything I can do to make up for it, well just let me know! Love you always! Joso
