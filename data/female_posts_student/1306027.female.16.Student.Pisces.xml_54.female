"Mister Pencil, can you please tell us how this all started?", says the newscaster who resembles a clipboard. "Well it all started around 11:30 a.m., When an irate student became enraged at a test and found an abandoned match laying nearby. Apparently, she struck the match on the back of a local calculator and set the book community on fire." The newscaster resembling a clipboard just shakes his head. Mr. Pencil too, shakes his head. "casualty reports are coming in all over the place Dan", reports Mr. Pencil, "The book community took a huge hit this time. So far, the book community has lost the History Book, the English book, and sadly, the Physics book. I don't know how they are going to recover loses like that". Suddenly, the broadcast is interrupted by the horrifying shrills of dozens of quizzes that were running for their lives. The newscaster, the one who resembled a clipboard, again shakes his head.    Ok so it wasn't quite that dramatic.  But I was on the edge of losing my sanity. Again. There was one question about an airplane. After doing the problem I was thinking in terms of matches and lighter fluid as I usually do after any trying question. I'm quite hilarious whenever I have a brain cramp. I start mumbling things that don't mean sense and then I go back and try to make sense of them. Like typos- only better!   Well... I should probably go.  I'm tired from coding becca's surprise blog skin and I got to take my little brother to basketball practice. I might blog before bed.     Chow ma!
