Today. As is the ape shit part. But for me, the degree of "ape shit" that I explored this morning is noteworthy. I called to apologize to boy for being annoyed with him about a phone conversation. I was only a little annoyed, but he needs reassurance, given his delicate state.   Anyway, after we talked a bit on the phone last night, he got all: "I'm tired. I can't talk. My ear hurts...You know how I hate talking on the phone..." Or whatever he said. I usually tune him out and go into annoyed mode because I live 5 minutes from him, he claims that he wants to talk to and see me, but where is his ass? At home, calling me from his home phone. So, out of annoyance, I was like, "Isn't any of this important to you? Well, I am annoyed by this. You do this way too often..." Blah blah blah. It was from a script. I'm sure I've said it before.   This thing about phones, the fact that he hates talking on them - adds a little color to the fact that we were in a long-distance relationship off and on for the past couple of years. The first couple of years were cozy ones where we were inseparable - makes me cringe to think about how co-dependent we were. But, just the facts.   So, he's all - "we can talk this weekend when you get your stuff. And tell atlblingbling that she needs to get the bed because I need to go buy a new one this weekend. I lost her number." I say, "I'll do that. But. Um. Well, funny thing, that... I actually don't know when I'm going to leave EXACTLY..."   "Well, you'd better let me know soon. Because, you know, I have things to do." Like princess? Or me, maybe, in your mind?   "Oh, well, I'm still waiting for this other person. But I won't leave you hanging. I'll give you advance notice."   "That's not good enough. You need to call me and let me know. I need to buy a bed because my mother is coming next weekend." Wow. I should stay til next weekend. Then I get to run into therapist mom, let her tell me how great I look. I would smirk as I read her mind: How could my son have gotten this premium POA? And what happened that made this relationship end? Oh, yes, that's right. He fears rejection and commitment and doesn't know what to do when someone as good as this comes along.   Delusions of grandeur, everybody. Delusions of grandeur. A girl's gotta have 'em. He broke up with me because I am moving, he hates talking on the phone and he is a sad motherfucker. He spends $1,000 on an antique map ("it's an investment, baby..."), and has the nerve to be like - "I'm not made of money. You need to pay me such and such..." That's how sad he is.   Anyway, I emerge from the daydream to hear him saying, "Look, this is my time. You have to make a decision. I'm not going to be waiting around for you to make some decision. I need to have this stuff done this weekend, so I can get organized for the visit."   Ding ding ding. Does anyone else see an opportunity for me to chime in with past hurts?   "Ok. Let's get something straight. How well do you know me? Since when have I ever said that I would do something as important as this and flaked?"   "Never, I guess."   "Right. So where do you get off telling me to hurry and make a decision because you can't wait? How many years did we date? How many of those years did I put up with you, not making a decision and making me wait for some important revelation?"   "Well, that's only been recently..."  "Recently? Oh, don't get me started on that miserable Christmas and New Year's in Sierra Leone, where you said you'd call, but you didn't. I waited for your ass. And certainly don't get me started on those antique engagement rings... But those things are in the past. I don't care anymore. I just hope I'm making my point. I'll give you enough notice about picking up my stuff, so please don't project your flakiness on to me."   Silence.   "Ok. I have to get ready for work now."   "Ok, bye."   No, there wasn't a juicier ending, with phones slamming, or tears or any of that other drama that he's *obviously* trying to avoid by having a relationship with a co-worker and having emotional entanglements with his ex. But that's how it ended. Ok. Ok. Bye.
