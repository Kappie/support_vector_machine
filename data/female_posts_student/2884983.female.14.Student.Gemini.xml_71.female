WHOA that was a BIG sneeze!! awww...I wish Carrie didnt go to Mexico. it is so odd without her here. only I dont miss the teasing. even though jasmin still does it...*sigh* oh wellish....he he he there was this guy from Lake Trail there that I used to know when we were little and he was not very pretty but now...lets just say I wish our families still kept in touch....lol. well I am gone...although I REALLY am wanting to change my style on this thinger..I am starting to get really bored with it...  Boo!.!
