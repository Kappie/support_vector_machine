"Looks like it could fall in any minute though," inspects Ryan. "Hey look! Free Pringles!" exclaims Jesse, who runs off immediately and isn't to be seen for much of the night. Ryan grabs some beers and he, Adam and Mickey sit down on a couch.  "Woah, that girl is totally checking me out!" exclaims Mickey. "Dude, that's a man with a ponytail." They sit, just downing the beer, watching more people pile in. Then they realise that all their beer has gone and there is no more free beer left.  "Damn," says Adam.  The three pick themselves up and head towards the centre of the crowd. A guy with a moustache elbows Mickey in the stomach ("ouff") and a girl in a red top smiles at Adam. "There you go, i saw that girl smile at you, now get over that Jane already," says Ryan gruffly. "It isn't like she  dumped  me," replies Adam rather annoyedly. "Just get her off your mind OK?" "Jeez, you were the one that brought it up..." mumbles Adam. Adam follows Mickey and Ryan wander aimlessly through the crowds. Suddenly he feels a hand on his wrist. "Hey," says the girl with the red top. "Er.. hi," says Adam awkwardly. She grins at him... rather provocatively in fact. "Go buy her some Pringles," says Mickey into his ear. Adam looks at him.  "Sorry, I meant get her a drink, not Pringles." Adam looks hopingly at Ryan, but he and Mickey have already gone and anyway, Ryan probably would have shoved him into the girl.  "So...?" says Red Top. "Ermm..." Red Top looks at Adam hopingly. "Err... do you want a drink?" Red Top's eyes brighten. "Sure." Adam wanders over to where he thinks the drinks are, but then realises that it's just a big poster advertising Budweiser. He nearly even walks into it. Sheepishly and hoping that nobody has seen him, he wanders off to another corner to find a drink.
