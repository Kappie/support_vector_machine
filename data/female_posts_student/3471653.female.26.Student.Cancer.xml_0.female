Out of curiosity I slipped into the sanctuary and thumbed through their hymnal.  It was a weird collection: --Martin Luther's "A Mighty Fortress (verses 1 and 4, unedited)  --African American spirituals (likewise mostly unedited) --"For the Beauty of the Earth" and many other traditional hymns, heavily edited to remove Jesus, the Passion, patriarchal language referring to God or to humans, and any kind of specifically Christian language --a smattering of Confucian, Buddhist, and English Romantic poems set to music --a large selection of hymns in praise of nature, human aspiration, peace, justice, and/or a God and/or Goddess.   (Ironically, I did not see any hymns from the world's largest branch of Unitarianism--Islam!)  I'm very much in favor of peace and justice (and inclusive language, for that matter), but in my world those things cannot be realities without the reign of Christ--Jesus Christ, the incarnate God.    If you can tell anything about a religion from its hymnbooks, then it seems as though Unitarian Universalism is primarily a kind of denatured Christianity--people can sing the familiar tune and feel as though they're connected to historical Christianity, but without being offended by the particularity of the historical Christian message.  To me it seems very close to civil religion as described in  urlLink "Biblical Religion and Civil Religion in America" by Robert N. Bellah  (thanks to  urlLink Tim  for the link to this great article). Thomas Jefferson said he thought Unitarianism was the best religion for a democracy, and I wonder if this is what he meant.
