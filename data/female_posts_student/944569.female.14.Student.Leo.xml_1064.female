I went on the Spiderman Ride, Dr. Doom's fear fall (i was screaming.  so scary...), Dudley Do-right's Ripsaw Falls (Derek:  nikki, if you sit in the back, i sweeeear you won't get wet...(little liar)..), The flying unicorn (yuck), Poseidon's Fury (the fake greek artwork on the walls were actually impressive.  I loved the design of the building and the pictures on the walls.  it shows that they actually researched about the sea god.  The story was terrible though funny at some moments..). Tomorrow, I'm going to Universal Studios instead of exploring Islands of Adventure and City walk like today.  I'm going to get henna tattoos and have my hair braided and wrapped.  Joy... I saw some of my brother's friends at Islands of Adventure.  The place is so big that it's almost impossible to find ppl.
