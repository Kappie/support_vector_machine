Eversince gradeschool, galit saken lahat ng tao. That's why I had to de-pollute my personality buong HS life ko. Ngayon, eveil spirits had been awakened kaya asar na asar ako.      Pati nanay ko inaway ko kaninang umaga. Lalang.      The thing is, my dad gave me a lecture. (In short, hindi nya ako ba-back-up-an sa problemang ito) He told me of the difference between men's and women's worlds. Sa loob loob ko lang, I'll make these two, so called, worlds one if need be. I'm surprised that I was suddenly blasted back from the 50's. Parang hindi ko matake yung fact na I have to bow down to males... Try me!      wala lang.....
