And just when you got to know people.  I mean Miguel would kneel and give me his sword to put away like a knight and tease me, I talked to Marki and sat next to her, I told Thomas he looked like a freak in makeup and he laughed at me, I smeared pink make-up on Brady's forhead and also told him to grow up, I told Robert that he looked cute in his mideavil outfit (okay people, he knew I was teasing,it wasn't like I fluttered my eyes and said, "Oooo, Robert... sexy outfit..." no) .... What a life...  The play today wasn't as good as yesterday.  I guess everyone knew it was the last night and was depressed.  And I was kinda day dreaming while playing the violin *ahem*.  I actually took a bow today, :oD.  The last two nights I kinda edged out and edged back in... I hate taking bows.  Stupidest thing ever.  But I got a lot of applause - or maybe that was for Alex who came in right after me.... Keep on dreaming girl.  haha.    Right before the performance, I was with Becca and Eric and Robert backstage.  And Robert found all the costumes from other plays.  So he wore this nifty fur Russian cap.  And then Eric saw this straw hat with this weird band around it, so he's all like, "oo, I can be Tom Sawyer!"  And Becca's all like, "That band looks really stupid though."  And Eric's all like, "Then I'll tear it off."  And when he put it on he really DID look exactly like Tom Sawyer.  He's all like, "now I just need a fence to whitewash."  It was so funny!!!!  But Robert lost my red berray (how in the world do you spell that???), so I'm mad now.  hahaha.     The after play party was a blast.  I forgot a change of close, so i had to wear my bodice all through it - but that was okay.  I look slick in it anyway, got alot of looks - hahahahahaha.  I'm just joking peeps, take a deep breath.  Sheesh.  We had this jazz music on - really old jazz music - and Brady, and Emmanual, and Robert, Alex, and Marki and peeps were all dancing.  It was great.  They played Carmen My Love and Brady sang along to it.    There was this sparkling cider there and Marki, and Cat, and Robert and me were all trying to get at it, but we didn't have any cups.  So we told Brady to go find some, and he asked us if we were under-age.  haha.  So we finally found some but we didn't have a bottle opener, so Robert tried to be mocho (or however you spell that) and tried to pop off the mettle cap with his bare hands.  I laughed at him.  And then Jeff is all like, "Aw, Robert, let ME do it." And Robert's all like, "Fine then." But Jeff just almost cut open his hand.  So Robert and me laughed at him.  Fun stuff.  Mr.  Bradley had a bottle opener, so he shook up the bottle and we all went outside and popped off the top and tried to catch the foam. Then Jeff's dad, and Jeff, and some of the other guys soaked Mr.  Bradly in another bottle of the stuff - at least, I think it was apple cider.    And then Brady went outside to fire arrows at nothing - which he stunk at, he got it to go what, 8 feet???  haha - So I went to show him that I could to it better.... And.... stuck the arrow up on the school roof.  It was fun anyway.  hey, I did do better then Brady. hehehe.  And then Dad for some reason dared Eric into doing 10 pull ups on the door frame (I'm suprised Sue didn't hang him.  hahah).  He could only do 7, which is pretty good, so of course Miguel had to show off too, but he could only do 3.  Then Mr.  Bradley had to show off two, but he made it to 4 and slipped off and landed on the floor.  He said he slipped, but I think he let go 'cause his pants were falling off.  hehehehe.  It was really funny.    Then (yeah, we did do more stuff.  haha) when we were cleaning up, Eric and Brady were all singing while they were sweeping.  They were all like, "everyone needs a friend... lalalalala" (okay, it wasn't EXACTLY like that)  And after the fith time, Eric's all like, "Let's find a new song..."  It was funny.  I was gunna ask them to sing That Thing You Do, but I didn't.  *sigh*  And alot of other stuff happened to... Like Miguel giving me his broaken batman sword (I seriously think that sometimes he'd stand on his head if I asked him to. haha) all keeling over.... and my rapping papper broach (I tapped the rapping papper to the neclace Sue gave me to my bodice).... And Becca's crown (made of the stretchy gold string that went around the rapping papper.... Doing the limbo with Jeff and Becca and Eric and alot of little kids.... and lots lots more.  So yeah... I had a good day.  One of the best days of my life I think.  A warm and fuzzy day as Amy would put it.  A day where you relize that all that fun you've had is gonna be over, so you gotta make up for it.  A day where you love everyone and everyone loves you.... okay okay, I'm getting sentimental now.  Didn't think that was possible huh??? hahaha.  So.... I think I'd better sign off before this post gets any longer.  ;0)
