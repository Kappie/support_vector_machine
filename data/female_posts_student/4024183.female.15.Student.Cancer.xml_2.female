We got to the bank, went inside so they do whatever it is that they need to do, and went back outside. Well, we got in the truck, and the truck wouldn't start. We figured this was okay, because it wasn't the first time that it wouldn't start. Usually, you just wait a little bit, then try again, and it'll start right up. Well, we waited about 10 minutes, and tried again, and it still wouldn't start. We figured it just needed more time, so we went to this thrift store across the street from the bank. No biggie. We were in there about an hour, looking for stuff for Homecoming Week, and whatnot. I got this huge hoop slip. You know, the ones that they used to wear to make their dress stand out from their legs and look like a bell. After I paid for that, went went back to the truck, and tried to start it again. It still wouldn't start. We waited, and waited, and tried again. Still nothing. We then had the smart idea to go inside the bank, use the phone to call my grandma to come get us and take us home. Well, I went inside, and called, and she never answered the phone. I tried again, and still no answer. I went back outside, relayed the news to my mother, and we sat for a bit more, and tried to start it again. It still wouldn't start. Well, we then decided that it wasn't that much of a walk to the church, so we would go there, and have Kandace, the secretary, a.k.a: Rob's girl, run us home. What we didn't realize, was the fact that the church was actually like a mile and a half from the bank. So we locked up the truck, and started walking. Once we got to the church, we had to wait, and wait, and wait, because Kandace was on the phone with some woman asking about Lanie. She finally ran us home, and now we're trapped at home with no way to go, because we can't get back up to the bank to fix the truck. We know what the problem is. Its the starter. Occasionally, it hits a bad spot, and won't start, but eventually, it fixes itself. Well, it didn't fix itself earlier, so we have no vehicle.
