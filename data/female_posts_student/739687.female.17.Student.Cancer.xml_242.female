I have this feeling that I'm anticipating a change of pace that might never come. I don't want to be let down, but I don't want to become faithless that things can change, and turn around.  I used to despise change. I was the type of child who loathed the idea of altering my daily routine of life. I became accustomed to a certain order of things, and I would attack anything or anyone that tried to change that. From the time I woke up, to the time I went to bed, I liked everything to be a certain way as I knew it. If some small detail altered, I freaked out. But, obviously, things eventually started to change.That routine started to ruin me, and I grew more and more sick of it. In fact, I was downright disgusted with it. To this day, routine life is something I can handle no more than I can slitting my own wrists. Because it's something that would slowly drag me down. Slowly and painfully. I've become more spontaneous; I like change, and I enjoy just being unpredictable.  Because if life isn't unpredictable, then what hope is there for the future?   Well, I'm outta here to study for crazy stupid finals. Be crazy, crazies.
