I sometimes wish she would just go away, but she comes back to hound me when I try to drive her away...I think I'm going crazy... or maybe, I'm already insane...  I hate it when she pretends to be me, lying so outrageously... but I envy her, she dares. She has the guts to talk back, fight back,defiant and rebellious in things she fiercely believes in, unlike me... I fear... everyone, everything...   She tolerates me, but I am jealous... I can't help it.. I want to believe that she is me, but, we have completely separated ourselves. We are too different, drifted too far apart to know each other again.  I am such a horrible person. So useless... no wonder I'm always outshined by her...  Everytime I see her, she is always surrounded by a certain bright aura. Why is she better than me? We look alike, we even talk alike, but our personalities are different.  She wants to help me, I know. She talks to me in the night, when we are supposed to be sleeping. She tells me how to make friends, how to fit in, but I always stick out, like a  sore thumb.   To people, I'm the more cheerful one, the happier one, but that's only a mask. Inside, everytime I try to be what she is, I can feel a knife twisting in the depths of my heart. I hate lying, deceiving people, but I've become so good at it, I can't feel myself own self anyway. Have I become a shadow of her? A poor imitation?   Will I ever find my true self? Or be forever like her...
