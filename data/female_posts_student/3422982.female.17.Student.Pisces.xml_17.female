Dad wasn't mad... ok so I told a little white lie, but I think he saw right past it because he asked me if I thought he was going to be mad. Then he told me the door was always open for me, I could come and go as I please. It's comforting to know that. We're still going to Kansas and staying until Sunday, but he wants to leave in the morning. I'm hoping I can change his mind. My braces broke again today. The two back bracket things are uncemented. It hurts like no other. Dad's gonna take me to his dentist tomorrow, I need to get these things fixed quick. I literally can't eat because when I bite down I jam them up into my gums. Well that's all the news I've got for now. later dayz
