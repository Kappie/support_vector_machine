As the articles (which i have included in a previous blog) discussed much criticism was targeted at the iconography behind the tattoo - it features a cross with wings. Whilst the design is actually quite beautiful, I personally think that having the tattoo on the back of his neck is rather unattractive. Perhaps if he had put it elsewhere, but where the man apparently already has 6 tattoos that I can think of.  I remember reading an article something ages ago that said that Becks has all these tattoos so that when you look at him you see what is important to him - namely his family. Whilst this is true and a beautiful gesture this is definitely a sign of a bigger trend regarding getting tattoos that mean something to you rather than simply just being anything. I wonder what he will get tattooed where next
