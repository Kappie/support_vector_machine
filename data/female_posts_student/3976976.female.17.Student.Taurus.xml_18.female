I think its the fact that you are able to relate to what they are going through, a shitty day, falling in love, or just a regular day, we find it comforting that there is someone out there who is like us, someone who you feel understands you. The good thing about this too is that people dont know your ethnicity, sexual orientation, nothing, just what you want them too... you can have someone totally opposite of you understand you and that well, really blows me away!    you dont know me, who i am,  who writes here everyday,  im here to spill you all my soul,  my life thats never ending.  I speak my heart and dont hold back,  I let you know the truth,  I'll offend you here someday,  but i dont really care,  you can bitch to me today,  and tell me that im wrong,  but these are my thoughts,  these are me,  and im not wanting you to like it,  just keep on reading if you wish,  you're shit just keep to you,  this page is mine you fucking whore,  emotions freely fly,  this is me,  cant you see,  so quit asking who am I!
