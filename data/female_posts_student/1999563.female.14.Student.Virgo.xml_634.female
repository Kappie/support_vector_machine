There was this enthralling video that popped up.   "Jesus show me the way cuz the devils tryin to break me down"  I raised an eye brow skeptically. How can a black rapper pose with a half naked women and proclaim he is a Christian?  I kept listening. I could here the awkward spaces where the cuss words were taken out.  How can this man be a Christian if he uses a cuss word in every paragraph  "I wanna talk to God but I'm so afraid cuz we haven't talked in so long"  Then I realized how he is just like me. We have both done horrible things in our life. We both need the same God.   I don't know a thing about Kanye West, but he rapped about Jesus. Though it has some bad moments, it has a good message.  I realize how much I judge. I think I am this perfect Christian who is better than everyone.  But I am not.  I am a Christian because I realize how much I fail and how much I need God.  I am a Christian because I realize how weak I am, I need God to stand.  I am a Christian because I am lonely, I need God to talk to.  I am not a Christian because I am already perfect and I just want to be with people like me.  I am a Christian because I don't belong in this world.    urlLink Here  are the lyrics. You can analyze them anyway you want. But really, it doesn't matter.    He is just like each and everyone of us.  He has a message and this is how he chose to say it.  I only wish he would represent more of a Christian person. But I guess I shouldn't be asking for that.   This song is a powerful tool to reach a world filled with people who are looking for something, and that something is Jesus.  We shold pray for Kanye, since he is our brother.
