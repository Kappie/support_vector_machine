While I am excited to be performing at the CPA again, I am also disappointed that I'm only in three numbers this year:  Wonder Woman, The Jeffersons, and Bonanza.  Rehersal is from 9am-3pm.  The show starts at 6:30pm.  I am glad that my Grandma Judy and Uncle Steve are coming to see me (along with the usual crew).  It will also be a sad show because it is my good friend Annie's last show.  She's going to college in Indianna (Notre Dame).  She has been in a total of 44 dances--not including this year.  An amazing dancer and wonderful person, I will truly miss her.  Well, I must go complete the finishing touches on my costume (elastic, velcro, etc).  Actually it's more like I have to cheer on my mom as she rushes to finish these last minute tweeks.  Then later today I have to go to the retarded vacation bible camp mass.  I'm only going because I need my 25th hour of community service.  Then I'm done for next year!
