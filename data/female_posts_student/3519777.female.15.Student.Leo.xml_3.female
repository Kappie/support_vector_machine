For dinner I ate salad... while the rest of my family ate yummy stuff.. my mom is putting me on a diet. So I only had like half of it cuz it was a disguating salade and than I went in my room and watched tv. I saw the whole season of  Road Rules South Pacific . Than I was hungry cuz I hadnt ate much of my salade so I wanted some cereal. My mom friggin put it up high so I couldnt eat any of it so i resorted to crackers with peanut butter and my dad still bitched at me. This morning I got up at 8... cuz my dad likes to wake me up.. idfk why though... it pisses me off. So than I did like 3 loads of laundry and than ate Oatmeal.. which i hate but my dad made me eat cuz of my new dumb diet. Than i took a shower and fell asleep while watching my brothers play video games. So when I got up i could only eat my fuckin salade but i said screw that and had peanut buttered toast... I was friggin having low blood sugar. So thats where I am as of now, but i'll be sure to update you tommorow about tonight and tommorow.. if that makes sense.. lol.
