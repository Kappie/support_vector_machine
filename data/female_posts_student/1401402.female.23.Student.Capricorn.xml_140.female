So hard that I could feel a sharp pain running up my throat and guess what I threw up. Entering the building with several metal detectives that I had to walk through made me realized that I am during the right thing. Filing for child support was what I should have done a long long time ago. Entering into the court room and there he was that bastard who once hurt me so bad. Seeing his face once more only made me hated his guts even more. And now he wants to do a dna test? Punk ass nigga wanted to do a genetic test to see if Alyssia is his biological daughter.   At that moment my heart drop to my stomach, I just couldn't believed what I have just heard. Honestly, I did mess around behind his back but only because he wouldn't let me go and we would always argue over stupid stuff and end up getting into a fight. I must admit that I was very stupid at that time. At the age of eighteen I thought I had no choice. But I was so wrong, I thought to myself that I am the winner and he's the loser. And that there would be no man alive would ever hurt me physically and emotionally ever again.  I cant wait to hear the result.. I'm gonna laugh so hard, so hard that it will make him so humiliating.   June 28, 2004, finally the result are in this is good news for me, he's the biological father. Just made my day. I end up laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Fucking bastard.
