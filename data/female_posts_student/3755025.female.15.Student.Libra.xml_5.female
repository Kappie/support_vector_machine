(and i didnt even get to see the ending!!) and then her mom gave me a ride home....scary scary-lol    and then i sat around the house randomly watching tv and making more brownies.. oh yea .. i actually cleaned up my downstairs living room (obviously for "sucking-up" purposes)  mood: crazy music: DADA- blue girl
