But good God are they good- too good to call them "pureed fruit" and get away with it.    Anyway, so speeches tomorrow.  I'm oddly not as nervous as I should be.  I'm going first, which sucks, but at least they'll have nothing to compare me to, and at least they won't have been bored out of their minds by everyone else going before me.  *sigh*  I hope it goes well.  Vote for me!  Ms. Medlin doesn't want me to run, though.  Oh well.  She can get over it, I'm sure.
