We went out to Abe's afterward, so we could sober up before dropping Evanoff at home. I met a shitload of people while there... hope that Ashley and I's conversation struck some sort of friendship, though I'm way too hopeful about some things. Michelle (Colon) and I headed back to her house and chilled for awhile. Mike and Josh came over to talk and hang out. I dozed off, but Michelle, Josh, and Mike woke me up. Apparently Ryan was coming over or something (I really don't remember, I was half drunk and half asleep) and she wanted me to stay the night at Josh's place. So in my half drunken, half asleep stupor I pulled out my keys and drove to Josh's place. Passed out when I got there, and didn't wake up in time for the ACTs this morning. Oh well. Next year I guess.  Today was spent cleaning my bathroom, going to Liz's open house, shopping, and dying my hair. Nick and Henk came down for the afternoon to work on the car, Nick wanted to get sushi but Henk's being an asshole. Asshole. Anyway. I think I might go out for dinner or something. Maybe my parents will take me out.... mmm.... sushi. Yotsuba, here I come. Blond hair, here I come. Ugh, 10 more minutes of this shit settling into my scalp. Yuck. I need a hair cut.  In other news (since I have 10 minutes), hot guys infested William's place last night. Most of them taken, and plus I'm not as pretty as the other girls that were there so it was obvious that I wasn't going to meet up with anyone. But Michelle (Evanoff) and I talked about her father, Kenny, and sex... a lot. The entire night actually. It was sort of annoying, but I was drunk off my ass so it didn't matter. Plus she was drunk off her ass so it's not like she would have noticed. Oh, and I was being very courteous about the whole thing. I really didn't mind that much. We made amends near the end of the night. I apologized for being a bitch back in the day. I guess that time changes things, so do official apologies sometimes. I just wish that official apologies would heal all wounds.   As far as Josh, I don't know what to think. I don't know whether I'm in love, or in denial. I care about him so much, but it seems that nothing in the world can change his mind... or solve his problem. My disposition is just that though, I am his problem so therefore, I can solve it, but only by extreme measure that neither of us would want. He showed his concern yesterday by sitting me down and talking with me. Sometimes it just feels so good to be asked questions and answer them so honestly. Sometimes I want to leave, just disappear from his radar; and other times, I want to be there with him for hours on end. I don't know which one is worse. Leaving all together, hurting myself by my departure. Or, over-staying my welcome, make him sick of the sight of me. Any advice?
