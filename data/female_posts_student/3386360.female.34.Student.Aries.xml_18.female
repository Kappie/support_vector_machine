I've already gotten my first degree and even though it is only 5 dollars to get membership I dont have it right now nor the energy to work on my second degree. I never understood the need for "titles" anyway. I've been a practicing witch for 20 years (15 if you minus the time I was with Tyson and unable to practice) Still most of the things I needed to "learn" for 1st degree I knew already. The only things I didnt know pretained to the school itself. (ie. founder type information) As soon as I move and get settled I will start to go back to the witchschool with the intent to do my second degree. Right now I'm working through the last of the "free" classes. Granted ok I didnt go there for about 3 months but oh well. I enjoy the classes. I'm very glad A.C. told me about the school so long ago. Wow it seems like forever ago he said something about it to me.   Travis is still being a dick when it comes to Alexis. I swear you cant say a harsh word against her even if it is to complain about her calling and not letting you go because he gets all pissy but he can say nasty things about her all the time. I am so sick of the on again off again it's ok here and there bullshit that is going on. Oh well IF Marina does what she said she was going to then tomorrow he will get his restraining order. I'm real sick of the lies that Travis tells me all the time about going down to see her. I dont give a shit that he is throwing his life away hell if he doesnt get his head out of his ass *I* will be calling CPS myself before to long. I am so sick of all of it.    Well nothing from A.C. yet. I hope he knows I am thinking of him. I dream of him nightly and during the day I swear I can almost hear him next to me. I know soon he will come.
