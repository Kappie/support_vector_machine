Normally I'm quite perky and a typical teenager, but it's just recently stuff has been getting me down. Like all the bad shit happens at the same time. Well, all things pass. So this'll just be my venting place for whenever it gets too tough. There are some really great things in my life, and I need to remember that. There's my boyfriend, the twat, who is soooo sweet sometimes, and a complete dick in others. I love him, but he don't half annoy me at times. And I have lots of great friends! Most of them incredibly inconsiderate and insensitive (they tend to forget that I am, in fact, a young woman) but they're good people. And I'm fit, and slim, and although I'm not very pretty, I'm mostly happy with how I look. I'm intelligent and funny, and my teachers might not appreciate me, but I'm good in school.   So life isn't as bad as it seems, really.
