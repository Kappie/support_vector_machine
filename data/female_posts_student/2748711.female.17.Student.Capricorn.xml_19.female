You think that I can’t see right through your eyes Scared to death to face reality No one seems to hear your hidden cries You’re left to face yourself alone.  god i am so sick to death of all the shit just running though my mind. i wish i could spend one day, where i can be with just me. and have nice thoughts. i am not afraid to die. god i need to get away from her! she is the most anoying thing god created... i think i will have  to move out. i am sick of her shit... cant think straight when she is around. i dont know. i'll have a yarn to the olds tonight...
