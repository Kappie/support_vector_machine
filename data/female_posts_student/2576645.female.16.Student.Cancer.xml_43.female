Bob Dylan, you keep posing this question to me, so I must answer.  'How does it feel?'  How does it feel to be so close to the end of school, the end of homework, the end of demented english teachers, the end of waking up early, the end of deadlines, assignments, and tests?  Well, to be perfectly blunt:  IT FEELS PRETTY GODDAMN WONDEFUL!  In the summer, I don't have to see people I don't want to. I can just make up excuses...or ignore them all together.  I can go to the beach.  OoOoOoOoOo THE BEACH!  I do not care if I have to go all by myself. I am getting my non-exsistant ass to the beach at every possible opportunity.  I can read frivolous books, because I can deem them 'Good Summer Books'. The type of books I am refering to are, of course, the ones that have no educational or nutritional value, but are delicious non the less. The 'Krispy-Kremes' of the paperback world, if you will.  Maybe I'll even get a job.  Three ideal working conditions: 1. The new Independent/Foreign Film Theatre (slash) cafe. 2. The library. 3. Barnes  Noble.  Ah, minimum wage... I can smell your alluring scent slipping through my open window now.  Also, (and this is just an option here people) campaign for Nader.  Get Bush the fucking hell out.   (Awww wasn't that sweet?)  Song of the Day: 'Like a Rolling Stone'- Bob Dylan
