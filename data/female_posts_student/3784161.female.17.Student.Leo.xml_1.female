This is stuff that I didn't write, but I think is absolutely beautiful.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Haiku Innuendo  Solace from such small words...   So rare a flower Delicate to touch and taste To own it blasphemy   ~Derek~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I'm 'back' persay. Return? What the hell would that be?  I say it doesn't exist - any real 'return'. 'You' cannot return because 'you' are no longer 'you' when 'you' leave a part of 'you' behind.   ~ again Derek, written upon his return to TN, perhaps some of the most painful words I've ever read ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I find myself yet again a chrysalis of pain and hate. I don't think I'll ever escape it. Or want to. It's comfortable to me now. So easy to hate, to destroy; eventually we all succumb to it, I have only lept time and begun my ascention early. Or rather, reclimbed my old pedistol, rejoined my old self. Foolish of me. I cannot help but wonder what is in store for this aggression I hold so dear. To what end do I clutch it so dearly? At the same time, I clutch eagerly to the better qualities I possess. I'm not all pain and hate, as no one can claim, and what many have; I am but human, and therefore have my own demons to subdue.    ~yup still him~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  La Belle Dame Sans Merci I saw their starved lips in the gloam With horrid warning gaped wide, And I awoke and found me here On the cold hill's side.   And this is why I sojourn here, Alone and palely loitering, Though the sedge is withered from the lake, And no birds sing.    ~an excerpt from a beautiful poem we studied in class~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "Nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands" - EE Cummings.   ~~~~~~~~~~  A Touch. Like Cold Rain. Perhaps we should kill the pupa? Let life suck us dry? Maybe we should cut it down, maybe force our dreams to die. Perhaps we should make it suffer? Torture; make it squeel. Let us then stop the chrysalis! Let's finally crack the wheel, break the cycle, and end the game; Destroy the circle, and finally cover these fruitless shames.   ~Derek~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   The essence of your presence presents Me with a sunset, an eye set, something God-sent, To which I give thanks for, And why I speak frank more, And more is what you hand to me In each grasp of palms, Every contact of calm, And you come to me when it need not be, Though I love and need you like a sea inside me, A storm of care that dares to be bare and fair, All that which I find rare is borne from the scent of your hair, So that I forevermore am never sore In the softest place of my body, my heart, Because to me you embody the part That was left missing, even before we met, It was you I was missing, And now you are here and only your voice I hear, Even when you do not speak, you are the most clear, Because your language is love, not at all foreign, It is as universal as purity and sin, Yet you are the counter to all that is wrong in my soul, You are the counter I lean on, my ultimate goal. I love you.   ~Amin Issa~    Written for a girl he's apparantly been dreaming of for 3 years. That part is irrelevant. What is relevant is that in my entire day of anger at politicians and teachers and my best friends, in discovering with each new step that something else is wrong with the world, I come home and he says can I show you this poem I wrote? I have much to learn and think about.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Never Let you down  We are all here for a reason on a particular path You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math Kats think i'm delerious but i'm so damn serious That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world I'm tryna make it better for these little boys and girls I'm not just another individual My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual But i get my hymns from him So it's not me it's he that's lyrical I'm not a miracle I'm a heaven sent instrument  My rhythmatic regement navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental That's why i'm instrumental  Vibrations is what i'm into Yeah i'm makin my loot everyday But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kuinte I'm tryna give us free like ---------------  I can't stop that's why i'm hot  Determination dedication motivation I'm talking to you of my many inspirations What I said I can't let you or self down If i'm on the highest cliff On the highest riff And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life And my grip I would neva eva let you down And when these words am found Let it be known that gods penmanship has been signed with a language called love That's why my breath is felt by the death And while my words are heard it confined to the ears of the blind I to dream in color and in rhyme So I guess i'm one of a kind in a full house Cause whenever I open my heart my soul or my mouth a touch of god reigns out  ~Kayne West~
