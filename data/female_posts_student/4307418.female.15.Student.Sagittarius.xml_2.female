We (nexa, clau, serene minus veliana) did the happy dance 2004 in front of a captive audience numbered one. THat one was Mr Low the one with the legend* and the revealed secret**. We wasted his time, to watch the entire second half, or rather, second 3/7th. And he wasn't really irritated i guess, at least he didn't seem so... By that, i believe he proved his mettle. I think he just earned himself the rank of funky*** MR LOW! YOU ARE OFFICIALLY FUNKY!  * Legend: Like -> Devotion -> don't like If in doubt, ask clau ** Secret: erhmmmm mmmarrriieee eeeerrrhmmmd *** Hierachy of (good)ranks from lowest to highest: Rock Funky Funkaay Other funkies:Mrs Low, Mr Lee
