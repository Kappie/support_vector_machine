OOh we had a good time at  urlLink lunch  yesterday hey. The great thing is that I can write about it on here and NO ONE will ever know about our secret lunch date. (Well no one but Rick,  urlLink the weazel )~Laughs~ Its Saturday morning 9.30 and I am sitting here listening to the gardening show on the radio, listening for some tips. The  urlLink old girl  is still in her room, I know she is awake as I heard her mulling around in there earlier, doing whatever it is thatold people do in their rooms.~Chucklez~ The urlLink biggest one  is in his room also. He is playing on his pc inbetween doing his washing.He is all excited aboutthe party tonight I think, looking forward to dressing up as a  urlLink pimp . Lets hope he finds himself a  urlLink HOE !~Laughz~ I don't know what to do today  urlLink Loua . I might play around with this for awhile, call you and tell you to get on and have a look. I cannot be bothered doing anything else. I feel a bit guilty already coz I am sure the oldest one will want to do something. I am sure she will be feeling a little better and be ready to get out and about. I have no  urlLink money  and cannot be bothered driving anywhere to do 'I don't know what' with her!~Sighz~ Oh well. Maybe I could rent her a  urlLink movie  to watch.(It will probably only put her to sleep). I don't know, makes me all uncomfortable just thinking about what to do to be honest.~Laughz~      I wish I could shoot! I wish I had a  urlLink gun ! Yes, that bloody  urlLink cat  from next door keeps trying to get  urlLink Henna . Three times yesterday it tried. Then this morning when I let her and Licken out the bastard was down the back skulking around. One shot is all it would take Loua. Ready....Aim....Fire.  urlLink One dead cat ! I am getting to the stage where I don't want to let them out of their cage. GGGGGrrrrrr. I will just have to get a  urlLink trap  and catch the horrid thing.      Anyway Loua that's enough to test this all out I think. I will publish and see how we go from there. Maybe we could get together today and add a few more things. I will need your help though I think.      Something to look @ urlLink http://www.mbayaq.org/efc/efc_smm/smm_cam.asp?bhcp=1            See ya, love ya.        ~ urlLink Back flips out the door ~
