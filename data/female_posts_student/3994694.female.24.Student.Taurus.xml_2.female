I'm writing about the community of Panya's conceptualisation of well-being, 'the good life',  xingfu,  development etc. Most of them said health was necessary to have a good life. I said why? They said because if you are healthy you can earn a living.  So -- if I want to track the change in wellbeing for the community, should I be tracking the change in  health  or in ability to earn a  livelihood ?  Because the strange thing is that now the government gives them a yearly payout from the national park gate takings, so even if they are unhealthy they still have a better livelihood than 90% of the county. Why would they value that so much if it's mostly unnecessary now? Either they value health intrinsically and just made up the livelihood thing because they thought I wanted something else; or they don't trust that the government provision will last; or they think the government provision is not enough.  It's too complicated for me to explain. I guess I should track health too, even if its just because that's what they told me and I should trust and believe their opinion, at least for values-based analysis. Hmmm. I wonder if there is anyone who has researched Tibetan views on health before. That may give me a better understanding.
