First the new Sinfield Superman cartoon is out you can watch it  urlLink HERE!  Second, I am officially from Oklahoma now. My parents just bought a new house and they are moving in July. Yay I have a home again! Michelle we will get to cali sometime I promise!  Oh I lost the pageant. I guess i'm just not white trash enough, but there is always next year!
