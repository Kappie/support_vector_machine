I guess you do in a way, but you also gain a lot, you may stay inside for a bit but you meet new friends on the net and probably have a lot more than you would if you walked out on to the street and said "Hey! Be my friend!" That actually works on the net, and on the net no one (some sickos do) cares about what you look like and how rich you are. Comments any one?
