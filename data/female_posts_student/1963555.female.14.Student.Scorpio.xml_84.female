I went on a field trip today to UConn Bishop Center for "Succesful Journeys" yeah okay! But it really got me thinking about college and how fun its gonna be! Shit! but for me to get there I gotta kinda work at my grades now so I can get into a college. So whats up? thats cool. I'm in the mood to make a list:  Songs that I like lately:  *Trapt-Echo: Its such a great slow song (I hate slow songs too!)   *311-Love Song: again like the 1st one slow and romantic, I love them both. But they really make me want a boyfriend..... ah fuck  *Yellowcard-Ocean Avenue: bringing up the beat, it's a good fast song  *Simple Plan-Don't Wanna Think About You: I love them how could they not be here? As the band said.... it's a good driving song  *Courtney Love-Mono: awesome cd, great song I love her words  *Phantom Planet-California: I know it's a little old but I love it  *Offspring-Defy You: Off the Orange County S/T, I love this one too!         I'm gonna go watch some tv, The O.C. is on tonight, I'm afraid I'm turning into a soap opera whore! ahhhhhhh bye!
