But I don't know why I said it again...) But then I get to school and All that jazz, and Dan is being... Well Dan, the guys are just are like all "drone" like first thing in the morning and then you see me. Now as you probably can tell, I'm one of those people who are like extremely off the wall weird sort of hyper chick - here I am all really tired, but I have so much energy and its like "wow... She's got a lot of energy for this time in the morning." and it blows my mind how I'm So awake-like in the morning.  Anyway that's beside the point. This morning I woke up really late - like 8:30 late. Ha Ha and yea I don't know if Matichuk saw me at all today - cause I kind of skipped the last ten minutes of class because I was sleeping and I got to school late... But then honestly (I hate skipping / missing class) if you were late and there were ten minutes left in class, would you go in say hi and face the wrath of Matichuk? - He's really scary when it comes to people being late, because people are always late to his class... But I mean no one is like 50 minutes late to his classes - haha I love bio too... hmm which reminds me - I should check if I have soil for a plant lab... erm yea..
