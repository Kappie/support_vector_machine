Actually all of it. i think that being a webdesigner has gotten to my head. Anyways i am free in two days. So this freaky deaky mexican girl asked my brother to go with him. Well not go with him, like she wrote a note to stephanie her mexican friend and in it she said that she wanted to go with bryant...like date him. Freaky huh? It scares me to think that she wants to go with bryant. Which brought me to think...if my dad thought it was cute and funny that she wanted to go with bryant...what would he think about me? So i told him and then he stayed quiet and he said "What?" and then i started laughing and said just joking! Isnt that so unfair? my parents said that they would kill the guy who would want to date me! Lol, i find that kinda funny. SO i talked to paige today, shes a real doll! Lol, no pun intended! She is really sweet and not all that pretty but she has a face that you have to look twice at. like literally. She is just...so interesting. I love it. So anyways, the doll (lol) started to talk to me about highschool and stuff and how great it was and how i should take this class and that class and this and that. I loved it! No one except for her barbie guards can talk to her. I loved it! She was awfully nice until Zack started to bug her! Isnt Zack so cute! Anyways...it turns out that she is mexican and that she speaks spanish fluently. Yeah..thats right. She understands everything that we say! Uh-Oh! Anyways...people think that im half chinese. Im sorry but these people are just screwed up! I cant believe them...me chinese? They have the weirdest impression of asian people. They probably thought i was asian cause i was on top of everything...like knowing all the answers...thats how asians are. Always the best...its the truth, i know tons of people who want to break that style. But no...not me im not asian. Im full bred italian and spanish. You know you love me though!
