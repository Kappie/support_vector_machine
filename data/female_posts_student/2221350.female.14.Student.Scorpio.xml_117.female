The sticky rice was perfectly sticky and I must have been channeling  urlLink Morimoto  when I caringly caressed the seaweed into a lovely roll. Spicy tunas and shrimps with cream cheese for Devon. Good stuff. I wish you could have been there, tr0y.  got an email from Jonathan. He's going to work at a camp for autistic children and won't be back until Wednesday. Making autistic kids happy? What a darling!  my grandmother in Texas is back in the hospital. Ugh. What with cake decorating classes, guitar lessons, the possibility of getting a kitten, and all of her medical problems, I may not get to Texas at all this summer, which is what my dad deserves for being an asshole. It's father's day and I need to call him.  June 20 is an important day in my family. It's the day my mom married Rick, father's day, the day my grandpa jerry died, and I'm almost positive it's somebody's birthday, but I'm a horrible person and cannot remember anything.  I think my   urlLink entophobia  is getting worse. I hardly go outside, my heart started racing when I saw a guy getting attacked by bees on TV last night, and mom is threatening to take me to an IMAX movie showing of "BUGS". She's calling it shock therapy, I think it's just sick and twisted. I don't see how she can talk when she had/has a weird thing about crowds. Whenever she mentions dragging me to that movie I think "and afterwards we'll go to Woodstock and sit in the front row, alright?"  aside from that, life is boring and my butt is sore from all this jogging. It's a good way to pass the time I suppose. The other way I've been wasting my days is by making stupid necklaces. I just steal a few feet of mammaw's yarn and it takes me like 45 minutes to finish one. I've done 5 so far and I'm running out of different colored yarn.
