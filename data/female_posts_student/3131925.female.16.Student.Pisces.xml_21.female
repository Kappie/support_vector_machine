I got hit too, fucking paintball went through a hole in the screen and got my back so i whiped it off on Clint. When I got there this guy Lance kept hitting on me and asked Clint how he knew me and he said g/f so I came in and said EX g/f as Allen went ooooooooooooooh! lol It was cool watching, there was a team of like 13 year olds named G SPOT lol. So me and this guy Lance kept talking, he goes to St. Bonie's and has like a 1,500 gun...why do boys do that? He was sweet and all but not my type, but he had the characteristics that Clint was definately missing. Allen and I are like brother and sister so when we yell or call eachother names we're just joking but sometimes it gets out of hand and Clint never like stand up for me even if its with his other friends and this guy Lance jumped in and was all sweet about it and told Allen to just chill..as Clint stands there looking at thedirt likethere's fucking  gold hidden in it lol WHAT THE HELL! But yeah Jessie showed up to watch Allen, glad she came cause I felt kinda awkward being there. Right after Jessie left I did too and as I pulled out the dude Lance liek trew himself up on my window so I rolled it down and he was like, heeeey you missed my last game I kicked ass and we won..so I was like oh sorry maybe next time. He mentioned me going paintballing with him and Allen next weekend so I said ok and when he asked for my number I gave it to him..CAN ANYONE GUESS WHERE CLINT WAS LOOKING AT THE TIME???? If you guess the ground..YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT! Once I left Allen told me the guy was acting like I gave him my number cause I dug him but I don't lol. Then Clint called and mentioned going out to talk n such so we ended up going bowling. Course we didn't talk cause we have issues like that..the people that work there put us right next to them so as they got strikes we got gutter balls n all lol. I won both games by the way. Then as we were about to leave Clint kept messin with the buttons and said the screen woulding work, and then he told me to look up at the tv thing and it said somethin like "please, I want another chance," and he went into this speech about us being together forever annnnnd of course I broke lol and kissed him and said I'd go back with him. It was a fun day but I got totally sunburned all around my neck and chest..and it's a gay sunburn not in places where it'd make me tan and look good for a tank top noo lol, oh and my neck has the tanline of my Tiffany necklace...looks totally gay lol. OH and I got to see Savannah a few times, she's adorable as always, she bought one of those kermit crabs at the mall with a pink painted shell lol, she leaves at like 4 in the morning or somethin...Mom and dad decided to be bitches to me today, everything I did or didn't do for my dad was wrong..and everytime I even mentioned what my dad did to upset me she'd go into the whole "well why don't you live with me..that ass took you away from me blah blah blah" everything to pretty much depress me, so THANK YOU
