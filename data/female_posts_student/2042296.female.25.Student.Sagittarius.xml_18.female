Delicious! Today we're going to have canard with noodles and as dessert some banana-chocolate-coconut cheesecake. I used fresh coconut for the cake! It was a show when we were trying to open it :D Well, we did it! With a spike, a little saw and a hammer ;) But it makes a difference and is worth trouble.  Life has been mostly really good. Especially after we finally got rid of one nuisance (that female I told you about before)...for good. It was about time! In summer she's been sending emails like "I wish you were here holding me..." and photos of herself (asking if she looks good enough to be taken home, lol :D). What a no-nice-word-for-that-kind-of-person! But now we've talked it over with Rico and it's ok. And now it's like a new beginning for us and I'm in love again. Or I mean, once again fallen in love ;) My love for Rico never ended, but you know what I mean. I'm pretty sure I wanna spend the rest of my life with Rico ;)   We've had a perfect weekend together... A little bit of shopping, a lot of sleeping, playing with the cats, a lot of good food and enough (not too much) good wine. And own time, too. It's a bit exhausting to be with the same person all the time really tightly. I've been reading and Rico met Dani today; they went to play billiard together.   The cats are adorable! Except when they come before 8 o'clock in the morning beside your bed, meowing and staring at you. You just have to get up ;) But I can't be mad at them, since they are so adorable. Right after they've waked me up and got their food, they come purring and smooching to me. It's a bit like having children ;) But only a little bit, since children don't sleep that much :D They have taken me as their most important slave, since I'm more at home.  Ok, I gotta go. Take care!
