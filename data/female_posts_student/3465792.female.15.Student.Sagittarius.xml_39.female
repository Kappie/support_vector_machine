Exanimus Deus   I look to the sky       And see nothing kind       I look to the Light       And find myself blind              No house of God was ever made by Man       If there was a God, we killed him, and       Now he's dead and gone       Pass the collection dish, share the sin       Pray your hardest, you might just win       Or maybe you are wrong              Go forth, Christian Soldier       Murder your kin in the name of your Savior       Your Loving God, your Master       Murderers share a special place in Heaven              God is Dead       That's not His voice in your head
