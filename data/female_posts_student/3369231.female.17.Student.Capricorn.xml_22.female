We didn't end up leaving end up leaving until later that day and Ashley and I both had to be back early cause she has SAT's and I had to be at work at 7:30 in the morning.  I didn't have any way of calling or getting ahold of you to tell you that we were only going to Bloomingon because of time.... so I am sorry.  I am sorry for making you wait at your house when you thought that we were coming.  Forgive me?
