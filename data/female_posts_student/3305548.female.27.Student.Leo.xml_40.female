This means that at the moment I am making labels for her apple cider that starts production this year. Good times to be had by all. Label making is a little frustrating. Space is extraordinarily limited, there is a lot of info to put on it, and my mother’s logo is 4 colors and she doesn’t want to pay for 4 color printing. Fun fun.  I recall a conversation a few years ago where I mentioned limiting the number of colors in one’s logo due to cost of printing and general expense as the logo will be on EVERYTHING. *sigh* I will work around it.  I shall be working weekends at my mom's orchard this fall doing a bit of the retail biz to sell apples. I signed up. I volunteered. Its extra money, and since we are saving for our big move I shouldnt say no to extra money.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: the third in the Harry Potter Sequence. Starring the usual bunch with the additions of Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, and a lot more minority wizarding students.   The Good: It was darker…more grown up in some ways…just just generally looked more real and less overly bright surreal.  I liked getting to see the kids in their “weekend” ordinary clothes. Nice touch. The whomping willow moments were hilarious for the most part, and nice little transitional pieces. In fact all of the nature oriented transistions were amazing. Hermione socking Malfoy in the schnoz was good enough to see twice. The time concept of certain events in the movie was done very well…I had forgotten about the whole time deal actually and it was cool to see it unexpectedly. Its been a while since I have read the third book.  The comedy is still present and well timed. My hubby enjoyed the Hypogryph quite a lot, and the closing credits were pretty cool – if not seeming as if they may have spent way too long on them. The lighting was good and the Dementors were sure as hell scary. The new Dumbledore is much more mischievious such as he is written in the books – a great improvement over the way too mellow and no fun Dumbledore. Dumbledore also seemed more involved or connected with the story this time…even though he was not necessarily in it more. I think his playfulness ties him more to Harry and the story line. Thank god they changed Malfoy’s hairstyle. It managed to look slightly less fake in this movie.  The Bad: The transitions between ordinary interior scenes, and between some overall moments in the story line were terrible. There was at times no relationship created between the two scenes being linked, so there was just a complete lack of transition. The fading in and out of black felt way over televisionish, and hindered the momentum of the movie.   Malfoy seems to have undergone a supreme character change/direction change. I don’t recall him being a character that I would expect to snivel or scamper away…he would keep his cool but still look scared in his eyes. He lost his cool a few times in this movie. Ginny was barely mentioned…and if you didn’t read the books you didn’t know who she was. In fact my mom and her hubby were quite lost at some points in the movie – without reading the books they were puzzled. I don’t think that the movie makers should assume the audience has ALL read the books.  And while I appreciate Cuaron increasing the number of minority students that were shown attending Hogwarts it seems like he still missed some minorities. The Indian and Black people are well accounted for, with no Asians or Hispanics to be seen. Plus the minority kids seemed to be in the front of every scene - which while I enjoy the fact that he’s making an effort to more fairly represent everyone, it just seemed too intentional. When the audience notices such things it’s not usually a good thing. But to reiterate my point before anyone thinks I am racist or anything - I am glad the cast is becoming more balanced – it will help ease the International wizards into the storyline next time and includes more positive images/role models and characters for all children.  The Ugly: Professor Lupin’s moustache. ICK.  The Werewolf he turned into. ICK. Who was in charge of his character design? Can we fire them?   THE ENDING. Oh my god is it sudden, pointless, and with no resolution or sense that springtime has come or the school year is over AT ALL. So sloppy…and seems like there was a lot more to the movie, but they just cut it for time without considering whether the place they cut it at was an ending or not. They should be ashamed of it really.  The Bonus: A new director has been chosen for the next Harry Potter Movie. Mike Newell. I hear he’s a Brit. I hope he does a better job in the story telling department than Cuaron, and hires a new editing department while he's at it. I do hope he keeps the overall darker mood and look of Cuaron though - it works better for the world that the uber bright fake look. I hope they include more of the book in the movie than in this past movie. They could organize a Kill Bill set up and film 5 hours of footage and break it into two 2.5 hour movies shown 6 months apart. And then still start work on the book 5 movie as well.  The next book is monstrously long…something will have to be done. Take a page from Tarantino people!  Overall: I didn’t think that this movie was too scary for little kids – although maybe it would be too scary for my cousin... Although the Dementors are quite scary in their own right, the Ring Wraiths from Lord of the Rings were just as bad if not worse. I think any kid who could handle the spiders from the last movie can deal with the Dementors.  Harry’s temper is starting to show, as well as his pride and interest in his parents and the people they were. They did a good job of working these issues into the movie fairly seamlessly.  But although I am glad I saw the movie and wouldn’t have missed it no matter how bad it was I think it will be the ill-fated middle child of the Harry Potter series. I also thing that the editing and transitions along with the sudden ending will cause it to lose some of its overall take at the box office, and that by and far the audiences will not consider it one of their favorite in the series, when all is said and done.  That’s all the news for now… --Mack
