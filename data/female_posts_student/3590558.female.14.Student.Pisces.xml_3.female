Don't tell anyone, but usually when my owners (Danielle Bennov and Siona Zellis) are not there, me and my friends and family play pocker and bid for Cow bills ( i think humans call that money or something like that) BUT ANYWAY!!! lets just keep that our little secret. Today while i was at the barn doing the usual pickin' at the fields,(inside joke) Danielle and Siona came to the barn and announced that every cow will have a chance to win their very own jornal on their website! and that the website would also be named after the winning cow! Plus the winning cow would also get their very own talking Rabbi O action figure with 100 talking frazes, and just for the fun of it, they threw in a FREE Rabbi O as your very own personal milking man dude guy!!!!! And guess what?! I,Betsy The Cow Bennov/Zellis, won the space on the website and the milk man dude person guy dude! But Siona and Danielle even said that since i'm their very most favorite cow ever, that i was most likey to win anyway! Now I feel so special and loved!!!! awwwwwwww!!!                            Got to moo, but i'll talk to you later!         LATA ALL YOU COWS AND COW MILKERS OUT THERE (that means YOU Rabbi O)!                                                  Love,  -Betty ummmm.....oops i'm so mooed out from typing that i forgot my name is Betsy!                                  MOO!!!
