Care enough about you to know when you're upset, not to mess with you or tease you or be mean to you but just to be there and care about you.   I talked to Chris on the phone for a while and I feel a lot less stressed out now. He's really being there for me. He doesn't even know why I'm upset and he's being there for me because he knows I need him. I just think that's so cool and I love him to death for it. YaY Chris! :)
