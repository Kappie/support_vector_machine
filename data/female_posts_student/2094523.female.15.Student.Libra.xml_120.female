I hate hypocrites.. i may be one sometimes but i sure hope im not often. i hate people telling one thign when the mean another. and i hate how people always try to fit in all the time so they change themselves. it pisses me off so damn much.   Anyways dont u realize how hopelessly in love we all are?   Somethings i'll never understand.
