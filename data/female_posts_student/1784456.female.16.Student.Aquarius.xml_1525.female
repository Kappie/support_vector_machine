Luckily he hasn't broken his leg... arm... or head! *i get worried about stuff like that* It sounds like he's having such an amazing time! I wanna do something like that next year! Infact!!! I think I'll drag my friends with me ... hehe. He's drinking mate de coca which is cocaine leaves! Apparantly it helps with the aclimitisation *don't worry, I checked it, it's right.* But in Peru it's winter at the moment, *muhahaaa it's boiling here!* and the sun sets at 6! Aww, so it's actually quite cold, and seeing as he's near Lake Titicaca, which is the highest lake in the world, it'll be freezing! I have to go sooory... I'll blog later if I remember *slight chance then*
