A few on the shops on Main Street. I have tons of shots of downtown...I'll have to put them up one day.    Taken in the car. It's okay I guess, considering I was in a moving vehicle.    Another macro. Ew, you can see an ant in the flower, hehe.  I originally had a photo of myself up here but took it down because I thought it was ugly. Come to think of it, I think all photos of myself are bad.
