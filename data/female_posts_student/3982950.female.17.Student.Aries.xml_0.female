Time for the Christian bubble to pop, the Christian subculture to be abandoned, the Christian cliches to fall by the wayside. Time for a generation of artists to take the media by storm. Musicians, poets, writers, this is our calling. Not to create a soundtrack for the Christian life, but to connect with a fallen, hurting world. Let's write, sing, talk about pain --without treating it asan end in itself. Let's express love poetically,romantically, with full hearts or broken hearts without dragging the it through the filth of sin and impurity. Let's realize that we are not  of  this world but we  are in  it. I'msorry, but how many nonChristians want to listen to MWS or SCC? Now, I respect these men and their ministries, but honestly, I don't see them having a huge impact outside the Christian circle. I wish Christians could be Christians  and  artists without having to be "Christian artists." Let it start with Jenna. Let it start with Jeff. Let it start with Caroline. Let it start with Michael.  And    let it start with me.
