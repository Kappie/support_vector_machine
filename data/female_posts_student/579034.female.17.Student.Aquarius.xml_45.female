I was so mad though cause I think it was number 37, I had the answer, just one more calculation and I would have had it... and Mrs. Erardi goes "Put your pencils down." I almost cried. So yea... the test was bad. I mighta scraped a 900 but I doubt it. Greg said I could kick him in the balls if I didn't get a 1000 so I think he better go buy a cup cause I'll be breakin out the big boots. Yea... then I came home and slept and then at ten to 4 I dragged my ass to CCD. I had half a mind to call in and be like yea I'm not comming but I went anyways. I just finished grading their tests they took today. Highest grade was an 88 and lowest was a... 24 I think. Don't remember and don't feel like going into the folder and looking. Okay, that's it. Gonna talk to Mickey for a little while. Peace x0x
