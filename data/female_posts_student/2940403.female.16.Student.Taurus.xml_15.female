Pretty funny though... until she started eating my plant again.  What a snob.  Today was overall pretty relaxing for a Sunday, did some homework, got in another fight with my sister.  Nothing unusual.  Ellie is a bitch... but most of you know that.  She worked all day yesterday, came home around 10, then went out partying for awhile I guess, she still wasn't home when I went to bed at 1.  Then she slept in until 4, then I woke her up.  I left her a message on her mirror to clean her side of the sink and walk the dogs.  Of course she doesn't walk the dogs... so we got in a fight about that, with her ending up slamming my door shut, yet again breaking the brand new doors that my dad installed on his few hours off every week.  *sigh*  Fighting for a lost cause...
