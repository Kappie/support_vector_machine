Y'know, like, until you find someone else that's more interesting?  I mean, these two pissed me off.  I debated not talking about it but it needed to be said.  Sure, they're a lot alike.  Both from New York, both from the ghetto, both ambitious, both Puerto Rican, etc., etc... But really, people!!  The ink wasn't even dry on the divorce papers, from the woman he married TWICE I might add, before saying, "Yes, Jenny, anything you say, Jenny..."    She's an ass for always needing to be in a relationship and never sticking it out.  He's an ass for philandering and giving Dayonara false hope in the rekindling of their love by remarrying her after she forgave him once!  What are his daughters going to think later on in life?   'Fuck the fact that you wrote me a song and cry onstage when you sing it, Papi...you're a pig!'   Anyway, there is speculation around my office that she's knocked up and that it was a shotgun wedding.  I guess we'll soon see...  By the way, notice how I haven't talked about Reagan?  Well basically, I feel bad that he and his family had to suffer so much near the end, and I think Reaganomics was good  in theory  just like communism is good  in theory , it just doesn't end up that way...That said, I can't really say much else about him.  Rest in peace, Gipper, I guess...
