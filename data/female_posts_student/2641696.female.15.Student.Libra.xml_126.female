I hope we can go on the pirate invasion weekend next year, too, because maybe Johnny Depp will be there *big grin*   Well, A described everything rather perfectly. But I know how to describe chronological, and therefore I will tell it all in a chronological manner *another big grin*   First, I got there. We were listening to an awesome CD my sister had made; lots of big rap booms and that kinda thing. People were looking at us strangely. Anyway, we sat there for a while, and I wondered if maybe B and A had gone into the Faire already. Then A appeared, with her wacky Tibetan Tourist bag, and I went "WEEEEE!", hopped out of the car, and did the macarena.   We waited for a while, with a bit of an awkward moment with A's dad, and then B arrived, blonde hair all over the place, and I did the macarena again. In case you couldn't tell, I was kidding about the macarena part. Do you know, I think B is one of the most hyper people I know. I mean, she has good reason to be hyper, what with her lover-boy and all, but I just thought I'd mention that.   Well, after that, we went shopping. Visited all the jewelry shops first, and I got a black velvet choker with a silver cross, and a silver ear cuff with little black jewel-y things. That's actually all I got. Didn't get a ring this year; they don't sell the sweet little undecorated things like they did when I bought my first one. Looks like I won't be replacing my baby Nimrodel :( But that's okay. I'll just name my ear cuff Bernie and we'll be fine and dandy.   We went to all the pointy places, too, and that was cool. I'm really mad they don't let unaccompanied people under 18 to touch the swords and all that, but we did anyway, so that's okay :D hehe. They have some super cool things there! We tried to convince B to buy the letter-opener (we had been joking about that over MSN only a few nights before), but she didn't, the poop. Instead, we only gaped at the swords and the knives, and laughed nervously when the salesman made the jokes about "how dangerous his job was, with the pretties looking at the pretties." lol. He was funny, but I hate it when men try to be flirty with minors, even if it's only in play. It's not funny, and I'm not flattered. Leave me alone!   The jousting was NOT staged! It says so right in the brochure!! It was  really  funny when they started bonking each other on the head with those wooden swords, though. They must end up being really bruised. And the horses were pretty, too. Very big, and smelly. I'm glad we didn't sit too close to the front, lol. The dust made my nose twitch.   We also went to see the Men in Tights, and  I LOVE THEM . Man, they are just awesomely fantabulous! I remember we stalked them last time, hehe, but not this time, because I was too embarassed to talk to them  LAST  year, and I didn't want to go through that torture again. I still like their Romeo and Juliet show best, but Macbeth was pretty good. They say they're family-oriented, but man, do they make some raunchy jokes :P I think they say it's family-oriented because no little kid would get them. Only old people like ME do :D mwahaha. Yes, I'm old. Deal with it!!!!   What else did we do... yes, the lithomancy thing was cool. I also thought it was rather boring. How do you get a head-aching gypsy to leave you alone? No, I don't want to go to Hamilton for the Psychic Convention. No, I'm not coming back next weekend. No, I'm not interested in buying an unlucky black cat. No, I don't want the fingernails you trimmed yesterday. Go away!!! It's just a load of fooey, anyway!!! That's right! You're false! You're a liar! You're a sham! You don't have the frikking third eye, now  silence , mortal! *smites her*   Oh, and yes, those sky-chairs are comfortable. *purrs* I could just sit in those for ages. It's too bad we're not allowed to swing, though. I really think a chair war would be fun :D Except no shoes allowed, of course. I think somebody should invent the Ultimate Book Reading Chair. It'd be somewhat like the sky-chair, except with some sort of book-holder, and maybe even that table me and B were talking about, for laptops and junk. And yes, bopping a drink-holder is fun.   Oh yeah, and the House of Musical Traditions was tons of fun. I still think A should go back with her dad to buy the flute thingamajig. BTW -- tell your dad that my mom is very sorry she didn't speak with him (she just didn't know who exactly he was, in that big group of people you call your family :P). I grooved on the drums, grooved on the harp, considered buying a music book, decided not to because that would be geeky, and then we continued on our Renaissance journey, whoopee. (no cushion).   And finally, the guy playing the dulcimer was  UBER-COOL . That's right, I said uber. You will just have to accept that. I almost wish I bought a CD, but that, too, would have been geeky, so I didn't. He had nice hair. Wonder if it was a wig? Although, it  is  a rule that all guys who attend the Ren Faire have  long hair...   So, all in all, it was a success, despite the fact that there were not as many gothic teenagers that there usually were (probably because we went on the seniors' free day) (which would explain all the gothic seniors, hehe). I am dead tired now, of course, but that doesn't matter. I'm just not used to being with people, lol :P Sociability wears me out, ya know?   That's about it, though. Gotta get back to work. Cyaz.
