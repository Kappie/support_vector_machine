It's nothing spectacular lol but I won 1st place so I decided to share it with all of ya'll. I think it's nice that I won and its flattering..but I only entered because my moms always saying that if I wanna go into journalism I've gotta start entering contests and stuff. So yeah. Really, I don't write poetry for others to read. It's a personal thing that I've recently gotten really into. But hey, it's all good. I'll learn to share. :D Feel free to critique and/or comment, I always love that.   Craving Reassurance    Stubborn is my heart, stapled with unknowns. Holding hope in a childlike death grip  while searching for something more invigorating in belief that it will ease the fear  from my discouraged soul. Lead me to the stream  that I see so often in my dreams so that I may drink from it the reassurance that life is a fruit bowl, with not only sour lemons  but also sweet peaches. That,  when you take your first bite â€“burst with surprising flavor so wonderful that you pay no mind to the vexatious  trail of bitter sweetness  it leaves behind.
