I need to sleeeeeeeeeeep.   I'm going to bed at 12 tonight if it's the last thing I do, lol. -------------------- I watched John Kerry and his new B.O.B. John Edwards this morning.   I've never seen two people faking to like each other so vehemently in my life, lol.   Okay no, that's not true. I think they respect each other a lot...but they were just laying it on WAY too thick for me to believe it.   And John Kerry tries to be funny, but he's not.  John Edwards personally has more charisma than John Kerry and certainly  more than President Bush. If Kerry comes close, it will be because of his choice of running mate. A good choice, I think.   And his accent is r0x0rs. ;)  //loves accents --------------------- Anyhow, so yeah;  My boss suckered me into working four days this week. She really needs to stop doing that, lol. I wanted friday off, but oh well.  In other news:  I am going to nap now.   Many
