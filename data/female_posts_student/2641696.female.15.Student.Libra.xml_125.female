I mean, if I committed suicide  right now , or murdered  every single person  in my family, nobody would know why. But I could. It's not as if I am so perfect that there isn't some situation, some set of circumstance that wouldn't cause me to do so. My morals aren't so strong; my principles aren't so courageous. My walls could break down one day, and I could go crazy. Only, here it is: it wouldn't be going crazy. It would just be releasing what is already inside of me. And nobody, not even  one person  among you, would understand just what made me do it. It would be entirely different from what I am to all of you, and yet it is still what I am -- I committed the act, after all. You just don't understand why.   Isn't this terrifying? Your best friend, your husband, your child: they are all completely unknown to you. They could be a terrorist, and you wouldn't know. You only know what they choose to show you. I don't care how long you've lived with them, even if you raised them: you just  can't be in their head . The beast is part of us all, and none of us ever know when it'll be released. I could go crazy, but it's not really crazy, it's just a mystery to everyone else. In some ways, the darkness behind our eyes gives us so many gifts -- creativity, genius, imagination, the space for individual thought. But it separates us all. We will never,  ever  truly understand each other. We'll never know why other people do things. We will always be hurt by misunderstandings, we will always have a sense that we are worth something, we will always feel more important and that our problems are the end-all be-all. We can't learn from the mistakes of others, and this is why we are bound to repeat history; we just can't know  why  people do the things they do, and so we can't  change  it. We are limited to the darkness behind our eyes, and that's all there is for us. No matter how smart you are, you only have that darkness to explore, and nowhere else.   And you might say that I would never, ever commit suicide, never, ever become a serial killer. But how do you know that? It is scary, sometimes, how close I am to the uncivilized side of the soul. I can honestly contemplate doing these things; I'm not disgusted by it, I'm not terrified by it. I can see myself doing just that. But what would it help? This, I think, is what civilization really is; the voice of reason that asks how would this solve anything? ...but isn't that, in itself, scary? Because, when it  does  solve something, I might just go out and  do  it -- and would that be civilized or not? I'd like to understand what goes on behind everybody's eyes, and then maybe I'd figure a way out of this. But then I wouldn't be I at all. I'd be Everything.
