His hands move up and down my back, making it arch toward him. I raise my head at this touch, looking him in the eye. I run my tounge between my lips slowly and smile moving my head back to his shoulder.  My nose brushes against his neck and I lick below his jaw. One hand reaches up and turns my head to face him and he kisses me for a long time, our lips pressing up together and snaking tounges, pushing hard to feel the other's mouth. My grip around his waist tightens and my legs weaken. One hand still at my neck, the other supporting my weight at the small of my back.   He lifts me up and he moves his hand up my shirt, undoing my bra and laying me on his bed. I kiss his neck urgently and move his hands up his sides, but he stops me, kissing me softly.   He moves his hand up my shirt, using his thumb to brush my nipples, making them hard.   (Sitting up, he undoes my shirt, slowly lifting it past my arms and throws it somewhere behind him; doing the same thing for my bra. he looks at me, slowly running his hands on my sides. I squirm and arch my back upward and squeeze my eyes closed. He tells me to open them and as soon as I do, he kisses me deeply. His hand moves around to my front, brushing my breast and softly pulling on it. Breaking the kiss he moves down my body biting my nipple softly, pulling at it with his teeth. I moan loudly and squirm as he nibbles on my breast.)  Shit. And now I have to go. I'll be gone until Thursday, and I'll finish this then. (hehe) I am going to show it to Erich, however. And he can add something if he wants. I'll give him the password as well.   Sage  PS: See you Thursday Erich. I love you.
