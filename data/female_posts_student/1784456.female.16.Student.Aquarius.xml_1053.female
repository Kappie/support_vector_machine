I don't mind when people try to break my bubble because no one can apart from me. When I become sad it breaks, and no other time. What really gets me angry is if some one tries to break some one elses bubble, because some people's aren't made with as strong bubble mix as mine and some are made with stronger. So if you lend some one your bubble mix when they need it maybe they'll lend you their's when you need it. Mmm... I'm just full of bubbly logic!
