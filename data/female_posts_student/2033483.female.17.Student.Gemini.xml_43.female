After that....I don't really remember that so moving on to church.  We went.  Then when we got home Brian, Tami, Andy and Alex came over and we ate pizza and exchanged Christmas presents. Next, Renae came over and I drove to Lizzie's house.  She had a Christmas get together there. Jessica, Renae and I entertained ourselves.  Good Times that was.  I have Kodak proof.  After Jess left, we felt very alone.  Around 10:15ish Renae and I decided to hit the gas stations in the area and basically discovered a new loop so if ya'll want, a new loop has been started and Renae and I were the founders of it!  I still think we need our own reality show!  It would be awesome!  If people could only be with us when we are together they would be afraid for their lives.    Last night I went to the boys b-ball game with Emily.  That was fun.  The game was close the entire game but we ended up losing in overtime.  That sucked but the crowd was really into it so it made it that much better.  I still don't understand why Tony Upkie got to play?  If you're caught w/ drinking and driving and drugs, get kicked off the football team because of which, why do you get to play on the basketball team? I saw Joe there, too.  Oh, Oh but the best part was...Malibu Ken was there!  He's a CHEERLEADER!  He's got long hair now and he's a cheerleader!  Maybe I need to explain him to everyone that does not know him.  During summer gym going into our first year in high school Tyson, Lizzie, Jessica, Erica and I didn't and couldn't of possibly known everyone's name in the classes so we made up names for some kids.   This one kid was Malibu Ken b/c well he looked like Malibu Ken.  FYI: There was a Malibu Barbie too! haha.  But everyone kept saying he was gay.  One time I had to be his partner in some basketball drills and he through the ball to me and asked if that was too hard.  Sweet guy but yea I thought it was nice to see him again but weird to see him as a cheerleader.    I'll talk to you later blog.  If I survive Person Christmas, anyway.  Cross your fingers!
