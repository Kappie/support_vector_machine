Here's the word from Charles Hirschhorn, the G4 CEO who will now head up the merged company:    Net's target audience of 12- to 34-year-old males, he said, is its best selling point to cable operators, who regard these viewers as the most receptive to buying digital services such as video-on-demand, high-speed access to the Internet and interactive videogames .   I have a bad feeling about this. I don't get G4 presently, but anyone who gets TechTV should be noticing the gradual changover to G4. G4 today has features on  urlLink booth babes  and a show about a  urlLink redneck supermodel.  Sounds enlightening.
