Though now that I am sitting here, all alone, I wish more than anything else that I'd gone with them, even though they were going to Chinatown.  I would try to go and join them, but I have no way to contact them and absolutely no way of finding them.  Perhaps I will just go back to their hotel and try to catch them before they leave.  But then I'll only leave feeling all depressed again, like I do now, and I don't think I could go through that again.    It's very tough to live so far away from my family, which makes it tough to think about staying in New York.  But, sometimes, it is just as tough to think about leaving New York.  Of course, I'm not going anywhere yet, so it's all academic at this point.    I have things to do the rest of the weekend, to make up for all the time that I spent with my family.  So probably no more blogging after this, unless something strikes my fancy.  And perhaps I will update at some point to provide a breakdown of all the fun I've had.  But today is not the day for that.  Right now, I am just too sad and depressed.
