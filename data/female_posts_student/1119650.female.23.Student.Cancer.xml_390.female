Today is our very first "monthaversary", which is very smooshy and exciting.  Yay!  Anyhow, we went down to the city on Friday night to see  urlLink Trace Element  play at Arlene's Grocery.  They really rocked, the new singer, Danny, was amazing and the vibe the guys give off on stage now is just so awesome and can get you totally amped!  After the show we went to Danny's apartment for some beers and to hang out.  Really stand up guy.  The boyf fell asleep while we were there, so we headed out around 1 a.m.    Bright and early Saturday morning who shows up to rouse us from our slumber?   urlLink Caaaaaaaable Guyyyyyyy , but it was sweet 'cause now I have IO, the spiffy digital cable so I can watch  urlLink Noggin  and  urlLink Tech TV  with the cool kids like Sheeps and  urlLink Anna .  Dennis and I took turns beating the SNOT out of each other in Super Monkey Ball 2 (recently renamed "Super Perp Ball 2", but thats a story for another time).  He headed home, I napped for a while and then headed out to the  urlLink Red Door Spa  for a really great, really relaxing massage.  Came home, headed up to Rockland where Dennis and I met up with the always lovely,  urlLink Christie  at the J² (aka the Palisades Center) where we were denied foodage at the Cheesecake Factory again, beacuse of another 2 hour wait.  We ended up eating at Romano's Macaroni Grill which was equally as yum and gave us some time to paruse the selection of exciting novels at  urlLink Barnes  Noble .  I swear to God, that store is crack to me.  I love, love, love it!  Before dinner we all scribbled on the table with some crayons, watched people leave their baby to eat a full portion of macaroni  cheese by himself and had the same crappy waiter we had last time.  It was all good in the hood though, good company can make anything better.  Sunday was a day filled with manicures, pedicures and naps.  I love naps, they're what weekends were made for.  Anyhow we went to Eclisse, this really delicious northern Italian restaurant, for my Grandmother's birthday.  My family all got along and there was no fighting.  It was nice and unusual at the same time.  Dennis came back up to CT sunday night and we went to  urlLink Cosi  in Rye for some S'mores and Arctic Vanilla Lattes.  Also very yum and really nice to see him on a Sunday night since I usually only get to see him on Friday  Saturday.  We went back to Chez Gwen for a lil while and started watching "Black Hawk Down", no matter how many times I watch that movie I still get really hyped up and pissed off about it and I still get really sad even though I know how its going to end.  New discovery though, Legolas (aka Orlando Bloom) with out hair and a cute southern drawl is just as hot as he is with a bow and elvish ears.  Anyhow, that raps it up for my weekend.  Oh I almost forgot  urlLink FUCK YOU  to my brother for getting 4 speeding vios in EZ Pass lanes in one week which resulted in the revocation of my ezpass account.  Go fuck yourself and stop spending your money on pot and condums to bang your dirty "Jenny from the block" wannabe girlfriend and start paying for your own shit from now on or I'm gonna tell mom, douchebag.
