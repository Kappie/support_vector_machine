Things have just been a bit mad trying to settle in.  Sunday  7:30 to go to church where we were greeted by MANY different handshakes and hugs. Viv and Susie went down to get Katy P (cue the music) from the airoport. The rest of us had to dance up to the front to give collection. Mystery 20E note was put in not naming names (someone with a birthday between july and December and is really tall…). Sermon was very “energetic” and in Kosa but what we could understand though our interpreters was really good! At the end we got to sing and dance with the choir and were their outfits, special mention to dave, phil, katy, Susie and Rachel for solo dances! Made us a good lunch of chicken curry and mystery pudding from woolworths! Back to lodge and Katy P produced (as if from nowhere) some letters from home and presents for us all – most random being pink marigolds for Phil?!?  Was beautiful weather so played outside and Dave managed to burst a small childs ball- TK’s L boooo Dave. Had good food and random humour from a book in the logde – if you eat something and noone else sees it, it has no calories!  Monday 6:30 start Katy woken with bacon buddy sandwich. Early for school so got to watch sunrise! Ummm… sandwich making timetabling followed once school started. Learnt Many new clapping games at break which was great fun. Classes and timestables proved a problem! Birthday celebration for Katy included singing, dancing, prayers, pressies and cake for everyone! More games and then classes with |PE and art for the little ones.  Some people helped clean the church hall walls for painting later.  The kids love hair braiding but usually ends up in knots and also had problems getting them to leave so that we could!   We arrived back at lodge to get ready to go out again for katy’s birthday dinner. Gemma was first in the shower when we got back and katy didn’t manage to get a shower due to water being freezing but dave and viv played Xstream Frisbee.  Rachel and Tegan managed to climb out the van window followed by suzanna and amber on arrival back at lodge!  Left lodge by 5 to take roundabout drive through traffic jams to restaurant via beach to watch sunset behind table mountain and to play with the waves, involving people getting wet!  Crossed the road to have a beaut meal that was sooo cheap and katy flirted with the waiter so got extra chips and a birthday song and dance from staff!  On the way back to lodge viv drove on a mystery tour up to signal hill where we looked out over Cape Town on all sides and returned via roads that ended nowhere and in mid-air! Also had a really short team time and then headed to bed after many games on ‘tedious links’ on the way home, the best being Gene Hackman to Keanu Reeves.   Viv’s time trial from entrance of complex to lodge was an impressive time of 1:03!  Tuesday   6:30 start (again) meant excessive sandwich making resulting in dave having no lunch L but he still managed to lead us all in a nice warm up session of aerobics! Classes in the morning meant that gemma got to count with teddy bears and dave did more maths, proving his hidden talent of being a teacher!  Painting commenced.  We taught the kids how to play Hokey Kokey at lunch and had battles to get them out to stop paint being ruined.  Dave, suzanna, tegan and phil lead drama and music about Zacchaeus which worked really well and kids enjoyed themselves.  Went to ‘pick and pay’ hypermarket after school to shop and bought loads of food, katy was bought a ‘mega flirt’ magnum ice-cream.  Went to Celias for tea, coffee nd biscuits, and reviewed how everything had gone.  Back to lodge for a 2 hour wait before a well worth it chicken and broccoli bake J YUM!!!!!  Team time with chocolate cake and cuppa tea.   Time trial- 1:03    Prayer for: organizing classes over the weeks, surviving with out home comforts, the kids in the school and the teachers who have so much to do! Team sanity!  Well there you go folks hope your having as much fun as we are.  Hope you are all well and surviving with out us, everyone is missing……………………………everyone! xxx
