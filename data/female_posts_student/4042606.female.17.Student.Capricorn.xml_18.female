You can do so by clicking the freaking awsome button below.  If you do not understand what a WMD Donation Account is, well, I will explain it to you. A WMD Donation Account is a little thing they started up that lets people donate "weapons" to a group the user names. If that group gets enough weapons they could appear on a top 10 list of most dangerous users. So do me a favor and donate to my worthy cause.   urlLink
