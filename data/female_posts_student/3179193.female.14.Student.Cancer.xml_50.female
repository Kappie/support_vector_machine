Tour the school, have several people speak to us, and then barbeque. Damn, I haven't done my Science yet. That sucks. *sighzZ* I don't feel like doing my Science. Today was really messed so yeah. But everything turned out okay as it always does.   I love Nima. He's so... perfect. Beyond perfect. I love him so much. Everything that happens makes us even stronger, in my opinion. Well, he just got off the phone to go to bed. I should go do my chores and turn in too.   AL has her SA problems and SA POs so easily. I really think AL should end this. Before they get hurt. She deserves SO much better than him. But she loves him. I know. :( *sighzZ* Gonna pray for her. I'm so grateful that God has blessed me with Nima. The best gift God has ever given me. Nima doesn't PO everytime I talk to him about stuff and be honest with him. Nima I love you. POS. Bye.
