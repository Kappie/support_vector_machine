But came the second half, the italians were tired and under a lot of pressure. Just 5 minutes before the 90 minutes time is up, the swedes even the score. It was 1-1 by Ibrahimovic. The score stayed unchange until the time is up and quoting the commentator 'Italy's hope is hang by a thread'.  Honestly, I do feel disappointed (naturally). After having a glimpse of glory, I was denied by the mishap in front of the net. I'm not blaming anyone. It has been a rough european campaign for Italy. First, their opening match against the Danish resulted in a goalless draw. Then misfortune came with the form of Totti's 3 matches ban (which personally, it's not such a great loss). Now, the whole campaign hangs by a thread after another draw. But also frankly, I don't think that Italy would make it to the finals. They still have a chance by beating Bulgary next week. But only if the swedes also defeat the danish. If the danish wins, the italians have to pack their bags and go home sooner than they expected. The whole thing does remind me of what happen to France at the World Cup 2002. Could it happen again, this time round to Italy? We'll just have to wait and see.  I do feel disappointed more than I wanted to, till the point of accepting the simplest consolation like having Trulli finally finishes (at what cost) at the USA Grand Prix, after having (another) misfortune at the Canada GP last week. Golly, even seeing him is a consolation (naturally).  Well, off to bed now.
