I'm on dial-up right now, which REALLY sucks.. but oh well.  Over the past FOREVER, so much has happened.   School has ended.. which really sucks, because of next year.  I can't believe that I'm actually leaving.. I guess that the fact that I'm gonna have Roxie there with me helps a lot.. but, to know that I'm gonna be leaving so much behind... man,.. it's hard... AND depressing =( Tomorrow the actual last day of school... and yeh, I know that I'm going to be crying, a LOT... there's so many people I'm gonna miss... man... this is tough...  Guess who called me today?  Bhaggy!  Man, I haven't talked to her in SOOO long... but yeh, the year that I'm leaving... she goes back!! MAN... it's alright tho, I guess...  Right now, I'm supposed to be typing up my resume.. HA,.. I need to drop it off tomorrow... or, atleast sometime soon because next week... AND, if I actually do get the job, like, for real... then I'm gonna have no time for ANYTHING this summer!! But, the money is good =) lol..  Some time soon, I need to get together with everyone, and just spend time with them... because yes, I need to!!  Playland and PNE, definitely have to go! MAN, when would I go!? AGH... lol... I need to plan this... but yeh, I need to hang out with Roxie.. Laurie.. Karen *hope all is well*... Rukhie Marci.. Matt.. my boy, of course...( and luanne.. but she's leaving tomorrow *cries*.. have fun! ).. and yeh, when I get to TORONTO, I need to get a hold of PRERNA! =) I miss her........ But yeh, anyways..  HMMMMM... there's not much else I want to say right now... so, yehh... my life bores me =P
