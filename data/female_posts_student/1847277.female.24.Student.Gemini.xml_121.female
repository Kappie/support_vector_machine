I figured I would have posted a so long and thanks for all the fish type email before leaving for the field.   So, I survived field season #1 mostly unscathed, and now I'm in Ann Arbor for a week before heading off for trips #2 and #3.  Montenegro is a beautiful country, and while there are certainly some nice things about it, as a whole it certainly wasn't somewhere that I could fit in.  I don't drink or smoke enough for that.  And, while I'm not one of those crazy women's lib people, I certainly couldn't deal with their machismo crap, either.  But I did meet some very nice people, which allowed me to make it through without going insane.  I must say, though, that it was honestly the longest month of my life.  It was so nice to get home to Matt.  Now we're working on wedding planning, which may be equally able to drive me insane, but will no doubt have a happy ending.  Okay, I'll post again before I head off to Israel, but that's it for now!
