All in a further ploy to avoid cleaning my room or doing school work. If I read now I'll be ahead, but somehow that just doesn't feel right. I got a 3.82 GPA without working very hard at all last quarter. This doesn't encourage me to work my butt off for a few more points. But maybe I'll try. Who knows.
