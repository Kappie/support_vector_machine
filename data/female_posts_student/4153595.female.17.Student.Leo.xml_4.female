Well I had a migraine due to the 900 calories a day and a gallon of water thing, you know.  So I just had a good morning.  Afternoon i walked down the street and made some 13-14 year old boys drool. FUN!!!  Later on I got a phone call from Shana talked to her, I guess her and Jamar are back together, but as she so eloquently put it, "IT STILL FEELS A LIL FUNKY."  My sweety called and I called him back and he was saying how he missed me and he loved me and all that mushy stuff.  I also told him the same, but I told him how late at night I get the urges, and he's not there to satisfy them.  He's pissed now cuz he's got football training so when I come home, he still won't see me for a week or so.  Poooooorr BAAAAAABYYYYY
