Kinda miss smsing with him... =D Wait, I miss smsing with him alot... Waaaahh, maybe he's having an outdoors camp so he nv returned my sms to him...Or maybe he's too tired to sms back or maybe he's ... ignoring me? Having smsing him for an entire week during the nights made me miss chatting with him... Even though haveta do it secretly...or else my parents will ask, "Who are you smsing?". And if I reply saying that I was smsing an online friend, they will say "Do not chat with online strangers..."blah blah blah...Hmm, but he's quite a nice guy!! ^.^ Anyway, maybe shall just try to sms him again when he's back during the weekends... *hold paper to my face* CONCENTRATE ON IPW...  Ast  - Missing the days gone, missing the talks we have. Oh babe, can we ever go back again? -
