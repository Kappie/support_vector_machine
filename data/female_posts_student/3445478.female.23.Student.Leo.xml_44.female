We also played a game...I put my face close to his and he would use his fist/hand to bring my face closer to his over and over again and he would smile. I also witnessed his 1st tear.-but it wasn't a sad tear, just an eye leak type of a tear. Nick also had tummy*time today and he did good for a little while and I just gave him pretend spanks when he cried and he would stop crying. He did tummy*time for a least 10 minutes. Nick absolutely hates tummy*time. I also worked on keeping his head to the left. He even took a short nap with his head to the left! I can't believe how much Nick is changing  every  day. I almost expect him to sit up and say, "Hi Mom. Let's go for a walk!" When he was taking a nap this evening, I looked down at him and his entire face is changing. I can easily visualize what he'll look like as a little boy. He is so beautiful. The hair on his head is starting to move downward more so he no longer has a mullet. ;) He is precious. Right now he is learning about shapes from his "Baby Einstein" video. Today has flown by! Shawn might be home earlier than expected tomorrow!!!!!!!!! I hope so!!!!!! I can't wait to see him!!!!!!!!!!!!! ***Nick's Latest NickNames*** "Nickerdoddle" "My Minastroodle"  "Nickernack" of course..."Soybean"
