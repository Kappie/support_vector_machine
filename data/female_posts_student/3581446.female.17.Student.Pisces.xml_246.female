Birdman:  Well, actually I had gone to the salon :P  Theo:  But the monsoons, they make your route perilous, yes?  Birdman:  Indeedy  Birdman:  I was being impaled by raindrops   Birdman:  I was dodging for life and limb  Birdman:  And then I realised I was carrying an umbrella   Birdman:  And then I opened the umbrella, and it gave me a 1 minute bonus rush to the salon  Birdman:  I had to collect all the algae I could on the way  Birdman:  The more I collected, the more points I would get.   Birdman:  If I got over 50, I will get another 1 minute umbrella shield rush , to go home.  Theo:  You're wild man  Birdman:  thank you :P
