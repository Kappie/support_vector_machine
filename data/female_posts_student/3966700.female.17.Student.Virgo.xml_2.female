Or maybe I will, Hard to say. Ne-ways Lately I been thinking about Erin ... alot I really miss her. I wish she was never take from us, I know its been a year but I wish I would change what happened to her but I can. Its done and over with, I have to live with that forever. I never understand how someone can kill someone and they can get off with it like it never happened. This is not the first time he has DUI, it just dont make sense. I lady can "get" hit by a cop, The cop dies and its all her fault, Then she has to spend time in jail. I dont undertand the American Justice System at all. In my eyes its all bs. And a waste of taxes dollars. Just like other things around the world. Its all bs but nothing we can do about it, No person cant change the world, So we are just going to have to deal with idiots and retardes running the systems. Maybe one day it will all be taking care of and People will beable to have justice. Pretty soon the death of Erin will be forgotten by people, But not the people who truely care. I know I will never forget about her and what has happened to her. I guess thats all ... :) R.I.P Erin loves ya!:D 1986-2003
