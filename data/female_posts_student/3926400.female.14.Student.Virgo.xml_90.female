Been getting a couple of requests for membership to the blog.  The thing is:  ( being brutally honest here )    "You might not write the kinda stuff we're looking for."   Jill and I haven't even begun to decide who we're letting in - I know one thing, "we sure as hell can't let everyone in." :(  Sorry.    If you don't like how slow we're progressing with this "project".   urlLink Start your own .  Don't ask me for help, tho. >0
