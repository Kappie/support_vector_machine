Ok so Gunter needs to become unpig-ish and Josh needs to get of the durgs. People that don't really know me need to stop bad-mouthing me and talking about putting drugs in my food. Zabeth needs her voice back and I need my sanity.   Josh get better...NOW. So what's up with the drugs?  You know how my mom has said that I'm not going to prom...I think things have just changed. She ot me a dress last week...she got me another one yesterday...hmm... I think she's trying to turn me into a girl...
