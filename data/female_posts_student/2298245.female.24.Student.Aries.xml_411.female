Here's Martha Stewart, on going to prison:   "I could do it,'' she said, according to excerpts released by ABC late Friday. ``I'm a really good camper. I can sleep on the ground. There are many, many good people who have gone to prison. Look at Nelson Mandela.''    Ugh. Puh-leeze. She deserves every bit of her sentence just for saying something like that. To even compare her situation to that of Mandela is insulting to...well, everyone. Get a grip, lady.  In other news, I am busily studying for finals. But good things will follow that, I know, so stay tuned. Or, more accurately, come back in about a week.
