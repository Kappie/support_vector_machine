Sarah has a lake house in Canada in Bobcaygeon. Did I spell that right, Sarah? I hope I did. We're leaving Tuesday, July 27 and come back Tuesday, August 3. I am SO excited!   The main reason why we get to go together is that I finished all of my summer reading! WOW! That's the first time I've ever finished all of my summer reading! You guys should really be proud of me. I even finished The Grapes Of Wrath in Europe =). I read about 30 pages a day or more every single day! What good work ethic I have when I have a reward after... I really liked The Grapes Of Wrath as well as Catch-22. They aren't too boring and both of them have incredible endings. I didn't do too well on my Crucible test, 85, but such is life.  Did you read Sarah's AP scores?! Oh My God, she did soo well! Nothing below a 4! That's incredible! I am in awe at all she does for me and for herself and for us. She's wonderwoman... haha. Congratulations Sarah. I am so honored to be your girlfriend =D!  Next year we will be doing Electra for our fall production and Sunday In The Park With George for our spring production. I am really excited about both of them! If you have even the SLIGHTEST desire to audition for either of them, do it! Its really a good experience to overcome stage fright and all of that good stuff. If you have any questions about either of the shows or should you audition and stuff like that, you can ask me. I'm not too scary.  Oh, I am also the Thespian Society president! Yay to me! haha. We will have a meeting at the beginning of the school year to talk about why we aren't doing Sweeney Todd and what Sunday In The Park With George is about. I think everyone will love it! I'll post more details about that later.   Sarah is going to be leaving soon... =(. That's going to be really hard. I don't even want to think about it yet. It isn't the end of the world though! I'll see her every three months, have email, write letters, talk on the phone. We can do it! I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her.  WE  rock! (Sarah and I)  *kisses* to Sarah!
