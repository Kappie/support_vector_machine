Before I went home, I went to Westmall with one of my friend to eat lunch and borrow books from the library. Well.. It might sound like I'm a very good girl but I was actually walking around there to kill time!!    Talk about today.. It was really unlucky!! I was called   TWICE   by that "Gorilla" and I even promised her that I would be joining the "TalentTime" next year!! Then at Math lesson, Mrs Gan asked me to do a question that I didn't know how to do!! I had no choice but to borrow one of my friends book and write it on the white-board!! Then I took bus number 852 home. Yup!! You've guessed it right!! Another  BAD  event!! The bus driver drove so fast that I had to hold on to the railing infront of me even when I was seated!!      I'm certainly out of LUCK today!!
