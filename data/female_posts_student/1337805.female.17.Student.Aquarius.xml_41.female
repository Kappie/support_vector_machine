I've passed my classes, and done JACK ALL so far. Wee!! Actaully, that's a lie. I've been busy planning conferences. I'm planning two so far, one in November, and one in February (one day before my birthday!:P) and I'm wanting a third, for the summer of 2004. That is, if Sanford ever replies to his email which I DID send him! It's pretty fun, and having been to a few cons now I know what makes a con sucessful, which helps. It also makes me respect people who plan them lots. There is a LOT of work...I mean, it can take days just to think up a THEME....Ours, for our feb con, is love...And the con is over Valentine's day. It works out sooo nicely..I cant wait. Speaking of cons, I found out that Fall con was teh same weekend that our LDC is. Oh goody. I alert my planning crew, also my YAC, and it gets moved to November. Yay! So far, there is a Con in October, November, February, spring con in april or may, AGM in May, and Alaska Con, and ConCon, and GA, if we fell bold enough to go. That's a lot of cons. I dont know if we'll be able to attend them all, and I'm getting very concerned because my youth group is all keyed up to go to the American Cons, and not our AGM....which means no money for our airfare or anything for AGM..which means..no trip to calgary (I'm still working my mom on that) and no erin, alex, san or gavin...and I misssss themm!!! *pouts* I must start my super human powers and fix that.  Third: My life right now consists of sleeping, eating, playing Roller Coaster Tycoon, email and swimming. The other day at the lake I found an abandoned air mattress, and took it home with me. I blew it up, and discovered no holes at all. I rejoiced. Today, I took it out on the water and swan around. It's so gross, the weeds come right up to the surface of the water, and it never used to, but it's so intrancing. Certain weeds look like evergreens under water. Abadoned christmas trees. Fish swim in and out, fish I only thought swam close to shore. I was wrong. The water is a very dark and mysterious place....And now that I've looked so closely at it, I suddenly don't want to go past my head in water again.....  Fourth: LAURA! WE NEED TO PLAN DISNEY DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WEE!!!!!!!!!1  That is all, love to you all, til next time.
