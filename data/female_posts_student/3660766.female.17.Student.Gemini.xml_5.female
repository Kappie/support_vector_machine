I had the weirdest dream ever! whats sad is that i have strange dreams everynight but this one is weird. lemme tell yall about it... first i was at this college campus with like hundreds of other kids and come to find out , we are doing While u were out, for this old house that was on campus, well i was in chase dakotas group and andrew dan jumbo, was sitting right next to me! LOL lemme tell u ladies, he is as hot in my dreams as he is on tv! lmao So ne ways, our group consisted of Andrea Dan Jumbo, Chase Dakota, me , and my neighbor Jess, and thats all. Well we were gonna put this decorative painting on this old desk and it was my job to draw two weiners on the side, and when i say weiners i mean Pigs, Chase kept calling them weiners to make andrew think she was talking sexual, why? i have no clue, lol so i decided i would go to the queen of england who was in the other room so she could help me draw my "weiner" and when i get there, Jess already was there and the queen was like Oh ur drawing is the best, and i was like thats not fair! Then when i get done with my picture me and jess go back to the room, and we notice that NO ONE is in this building n e more and theres blood everywhere, so were like freaking out, so we run back to the queen and shes like, its ok girls, i have protective lions that look after me... LOL so she calls upon the lions but forgets to tell them that jess and i are her friends, so we are hiding from these lions. well we get outside and we notice that EVERYTHING is 1970's as if we went back in time, but then i hear this woman complaining about where her car went and this man was like, what year is it and she was like its an 85 and he goes, its over there with the rest of the traitor cars, so i knew that we didnt go back in time. Well n e ways i meet up with this family that i dont even know lol and they are talking about their grandpas funeral, and i was like tagging along with them, so we are in this room, and i see this old man sitting on this chair, and it was the grandpa, and he was still alive! but they were gonna see if he was old enough to kill him, and i was like wtf and they decided he was old enough so they were picking out a good method for him to die, and they were shooting arrows at this target and no one was able to hit it, except for this 3 yr old boy, and he got every arrow to hit the target bc , and this is what a man said " the got smaller hands and better aim so they can hit anything" then after this family killed grandpa they were singing this alabama song, and it was my turn to sing it and i was like, i dont know it, im from indiana, and the lil 3 yr old boy was like NO NO NO u cant be here ! and i just sat there, while they went on singing the song... and that was my dream! lol i woke up and was like wtf! lol i dont think i can ever watch while u were out, or see a grandpa again, without gettting the willies.lol : )
