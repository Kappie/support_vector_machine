Attendance A+  Behavior A  Communication A  Dancing A  Drawing A  Listening A  Music A  Sharing B  Singing A  Anita, (Alyssia's teacher) told me that this little one got potential. Alyssia is much stronger and much active then any other kids that is there. Alyssia is always the leader of any kind of games. Alyssia is always the first one that comes up with an ideal game to play with the other kids. Alyssia tells other kids what to do. Alyssia always want to do things on her own. She even folds her blanket after she wakes up. She likes to help and she cleans up after herself. She loves story times. She would act, sing and dance along to story time. She is a goof ball but a real cutie.    Everyone at school loves Alyssia so much. I think that it will break their heart if I was to cast Alyssia away from them. Everyone there is just so nice to my daughter and very kind enough to buy her things. Alyssia is just so spoil by everyone there.   As a single parent, I would like to recommend Mary's Day Care to a low-income family. Its cheap, clean, friendly, a good start for preschool, piano lesson, and the best part of all, your child will learn how to speak Chinese and English.     So far so good. Alyssia is a very bright little girl. I am so lucky to have a daughter that is very elegant and smart. As for sharing, don't even count on it. This little girl is very feisty. What can I say she's got charisma.   Anita is very proud of me for coming this far. She has asked me what have I done to have such a great daughter like Alyssia? It is a secret but I rather center on this administration ability to give people the entire truth, the full picture of reality.   I have a routine of what I like to do. I would read to Alyssia before she goes to bed. Talk to her and listen to what she has to say. My whole intention is to teach her what I know. This is very hard for me as a single mom but I never regret having her as my daughter at all. However, what I regret most is having her at the wrong time.   In the past few weeks some questions have begun to arise about just how am I going to make it through alone. Am I going to make it? Will I have success in reaching for my goals? Am I doing the right thing? Am I a great mom to Alyssia yet? All of these crazy questions running through my mind, fear and afraid that I may not give her enough. However, you know what I will keep my head up strong and always to face my fears. It has been so many years without anyone's help I think I'm doing a great job. What am I to know I cannot judge myself? Can anyone judge me? What are my grades? Did I past the test?
