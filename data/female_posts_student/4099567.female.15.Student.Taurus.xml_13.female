Of course, we have just returned from Hartford, when my mother makes us drive BACK to Bloomfield, so that we can bring our couch to my father's apartment. Well, now we have no furniture whatsoever in our living room. Here's an overview of the room right now: Old stereo and turntable Collection of records and tapes (VERY diminished since my dad took most of them) 2001-model of a Gateway flat-screen computer Computer chair that we got at a tag sale for two dollars Television (old, small, buttons don't work) DVD player VCR (Both cheap and on sale when we bought them) Movie TV (newer, our old one didn't have a DVD port-thing) blue sparkly drumset (second hand, mine of course!) Book case of books I had when i was 5 foam map of the US a game shelf aand that's it Notice that there are no chairs, meaning that we are adopting the Japenese tradition of sitting on the floor. Comfy. Oh well, not like we needed something to sit on, anyways. The floor's good enough for the cat, so it's good enough for me too Love ya, April
