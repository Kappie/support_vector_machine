( he begins to cry) you look like my son who died yesterday in a car wreck." and matt being the nice guy he is was like im so sorry i wish i could make it up to you its just that you kinda freaked us out.  so me and matt walk around alittle bit to make sure he doesnt keep following us. we get to the register and hes right in front of us and we try not to notice him but he starts talking to matt how right before his son drove off he got in a fight with his son and he never got a chance to say bye. can you say bye dad its my fault and ill say bye son no im sorry about it. and matt still feeling bad said sure. so matt says bye dad its my fault and the guy says bye son im sorry about it. we check out and the cashier says that will be $334.43!!! we were like no your wrong and she said no im right his dad said youse would pay.. and im like quick call the cops.  and i run out there and start yelling at the guy why you do that that not right and hes like man i gotta feed my family and hes throwing in like snickers and milky ways and junk food and i try to grab him to stop him but hes bigger than me so he throws me on the ground and starts kicking me in the legs and the ribs matt came cuz he saw this out the front window of walmart he comes knocks the guy off me and has him on the ground and i start pulling his leg..... jsut like im pulling yours          (stole this from my buddy eric lol)
