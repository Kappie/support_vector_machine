It was the most amazing night I've had in a long time. Ha! It no wonder I love him so much. He makes me feel all great and special inside and I love that. He's so shy, but to me, he's everything in a word... Perfect.  Haha.. I guess I should tell you who I'm talking about - I'm talking about: Nick! My Silly Goose - Two birds of a feather. He and I had the most awesome time together, and I wish that time would just stop and we'd forever be there in the same moment. Wow, people think I may have fallen head over heels, but I truly think that Nick is my other puzzle piece.  Anyway - about my night. Well we met at four at the bridge in west ed, the one over by TNT in West Edmonton Mall Chinatown. Haha man was I nervous, haha oh well he was there and that was all that mattered. Well, we went to get bubble tea and He's such a gentleman. He paid for Everything today - Everything. He paid for Bubble tea, paid for supper, paid for the movie tickets - A gentleman. It was great, although I kept questioning if he was sure he got it all. -being Donna you know. Anyway, we walked around hand in hand and yea he was walking behind me and I was holding his hands - and us being both klutzes well... haha we were CAREFUL! We went "browsing" haha anyway we ummmmmmmmmmmm...... Right we walked through Galaxyland and stuff and yea ^__^  And then, and then, and then: we went for supper! Supper man Supper! haha we went to the old spaghetti factory. The old spaghetti factory was so awesome! Haha even though we didn't eat much - because we were slightly full - we had so much fun together. haha we talked and well I talked because he's so shy, but yea hehe we laughed so much. We also left a $3.00 tip - not the best but its not bad saying that its 10 percent of out meal.   and then we went to the movie. Oh my - Van Helsing was soooo awesome. haha scary but awesome. Haha I'm so glad he was with me. I was soo scared. I must have jumped like eight million times before the movie actually got going. haha I held on to his hands all movie long and everytime a scary part came up, I would bury my head into his jacket and squeeze his hands. Haha, He's got strong hands they are so great. Because I'd squeeze then and he'd just hold tighter - I felt so loved. haha and then yea it was so beautiful.(no we weren't snogging, I actually know what the movie is about) - but yea - No kiss if you are wondering though. haha so many opportunities for one too. ^__^ - oh well... Still I had a Wonderful time with him. *sigh*
