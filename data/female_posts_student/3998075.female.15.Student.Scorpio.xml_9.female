I feel like it's my fault that my uncle has to work more than he should and that him and his wife and kids are missing out on alot of things because i me. I try to help all that i can.....but it never seems like enough to me. They have changed my life for the better and i don't know how  i could ever repay them for all the kindness that they have....they are such great people and i am so thankful that they are here for me. If i had to live another day in Abingdon with Sis and Don i don't know what i would have done. They just made me feel so ashamed to be who i am....i had to be a whole nother person when i was around them...i didn't have a choice i had nowhere to go.....i know that they couldn't see it but it was killing me.....i think that's the reason that  i don't know who i am anymore...i feel like i can't just be myself without hurting anyone and everyone around me. Sis made me feel so low and now it feels like i can't even fine myself anymore.....it wasn't even a day after my mom died that i had to pick up and leave and live a whole nother life....i had to make new friends....i had to change schools to most people that wouldn't seem so bad....but i was leaving my best friend and all my family and even the most incredible guy i have ever known behind....and that destoryed me. I didn't have time to grieve....i think it took me a couple of months to realize that my mom was never coming back to me.. and that hurt...ALOT. MOre that most people can imagine. PEople keep telling me that it's been six months that i need to get over her and move on and be happpy....it's not long enuf to get over some one u loved so much...and no that she's never gonna be there....that's the hardest thing of all. and when i came back to roanoke i just felt like i was forgotten. It seems like noone want's to be around me anymore....i guess that's what i deserve tho.....untill later.....
