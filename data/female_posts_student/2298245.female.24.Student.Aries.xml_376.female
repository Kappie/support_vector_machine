       
      Well, after a prolonged week of agony (perhaps one day I will post about my almost sick compulsion to blow every little thing WAY out of proportion - but alas, today is not that day), I have decided to continue with the reports of family fun, even though the memories are two weeks old and they are rapidly fading from my brain.    Today, the events leading up to the single most surprising event of the whole week, and a little on the event itself, namely, the fact that I recommended something to other people and  they actually ended up liking it .  I should probably offer some sort of explanation for the previous statement.  Whenever I recommend something, or pick something to see or do, usually my family ends up hating it.  I cannot tell you how many times we'd have family rental nights, when we all still lived at home, and each of us would get to pick a movie.  Everyone always hated whatever I ended up picking.  Then again, I sometimes ended up hating what I picked as well.  I remember one particularly unfortunate incident involving an Oliver Stone film which shall remain nameless...but I digress.  Anyway, everyone had settled on  Assassins , perhaps despite my recommendation, though no one held out much hope that it would be available at the TKTS booth.  I was slightly more optimistic.  Anyway, I arose bright and early (quite a feat considering I had wandered the streets of Times Square with said family the night before in search of food and only arrived home after a prolonged train ride home - prolonged because I had to wait at least 30 minutes for the darn thing to show up), and went to meet my family (more accurately, my grandmother, sister, sister's fiance, and one of my mother's students who was also on the trip) at their hotel for the incredibly short walk (a whole block almost) to the TKTS booth.  We were the first ones in line practically, which was cool.  Highlights while waiting in line:  meeting the guy in line behind us, named Brian, who was also hoping for  Assassins  tickets, seeing my sister's fiance and my mom's random student almost get hit by a cab as they ran jaywalkingly across Broadway just as the light changed, and getting to really talk to my sister and grandmother for the first time since they'd arrived.  Well, eventually, we did get the tickets we wanted, and being the first ones in line guaranteed us really good seats.  And they were really good, as we found out when we got to the theater...but I am perhaps getting ahead of myself, for why should I make this story shorter, when I could make it longer and more boring.  After we got tickets, we took a stroll through the Diamond District in search of an optometrist so that my sister's fiance could get hold of some new contacts.  We struck out there, and then wandered over to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  It was beautiful, as always.  Then we wandered some more, in search this time of ice cream, and we ended up at Bryant Park, and the public library there.    This may not seem like it took up a lot of time, but then, suddenly, it was time to go to the theater.  But not before getting distracted once or twice by clothing stores, which always create in irresistible impulse in my sister to go in.  Seriously, they have almost a hypnotic effect on her.  Eventually, though, we were able to drag her away from the light and into the darkness of the theater.  We settled in and found out that our seats were, indeed, fabulous, and that we were right next to our friend from line named Brian.  We all got drinks (I had a Jack  Coke, thank you very much - perhaps one day we'll get a post on why I like mixed drinks, but again, today is not that day - I wouldn't want to confuse anyone), and chatted a little before the show began.  As I began to explain the premise of the show, and how there wasn't a plot to speak of, I could sense everyone's eyes glaze over a bit, and I began to have that sinking feeling that I get every time I recommend something.  But I thought, oh well, at least I am going to enjoy myself.  The show was, once again, spectacular.  It was so much better than I'd remembered it.  I would recommend to anyone thinking of seeing it to get seats as close to the front of the stage as possible.  It is an intimate show, and even though Studio 54 (which, by the way is on 54th Street, hence the name - this was one of the discoveries that seemed to make the rounds in our group one by one, with someone no one hearing as each declared that they'd finally figured it out) is a small theater, it still benefits one, I would think, to be as close as possible.    As I've already indicated, everyone in the group loved the show.  And it wasn't that fake praise that I hear sometimes because people are worried about bruising my ego or hurting my feelings.  No, they really meant it.  I felt very proud, like I'd accomplished something of great import, even though I'd done nothing of the kind.   Next time, a slightly more depressing post, as we go backstage at  Movin' Out  and sit too close at the ballet and our heroine comes to a realization...well, of sorts, anyway.
