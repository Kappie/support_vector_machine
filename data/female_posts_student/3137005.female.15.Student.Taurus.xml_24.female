Blogs are not places where we talk about people because we are too afraid to tell them things to their face because we do not have the bottle. Some people need to sort themselves out before they start having a go at me. I cannot say this to said persons face as I am not in Lancashire, but if I was I would. I at least say the things that go into my diary to people's faces as well. I hope from this you will learn what it feels like. I will not be in school on Monday. Sort yourself out in time for Tuesday. That's all I have to say about that.I too like Sammy care. See you all on Tuesday, you too Jess. Dani  ps. A memo for future reference... NEVER annoy me when I am already mildly irritated. The results are as you can see...Unpleasant.  pps. If you didn't want to fall out with people over this. You should have told us BEFORE you blasted it all over your blog.
