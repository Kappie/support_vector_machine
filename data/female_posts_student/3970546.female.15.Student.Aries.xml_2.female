I am so pissed off!!! i mean come on, the unit has like 3 years left before he retires and posada is just coming into his own as one of the top catchers in the league. As far as our pitching goes, well yea we do need more help. Mike should be coming off the DL any day now, i have no clue what Brown is doing. Jose Contreras, well ever since his family has come back from cuba, hes been automatic, i guess we really do need more help. But couldnt we give someone away besides posada? Don't get me wrong, i love Giambi, but he hasnt been performing lately, i think we could live without him. Maybe bubba crosby could play first instead of outfield, he has been a promising prospect (needless to say how cute he is lol) Anyway i just hope these rumors are false.
