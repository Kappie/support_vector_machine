So, I gave him 4 oz's of that and it didn't turn out well. When we got home, he was very clingy and cried/fussed until he finally went to sleep. This last week, Nick has not been sleeping well at night. He has been getting up 3 or more times during the night and more crabby than usual once he gets up. Nick has been doing very well at tummy time! He also will turn towards you while you are talking and really look at you. He also has fits of laughter. Today I had him propped in bed and he started laughing so hard, and so did I!My favorite sound in the whole wide world is Nick's laughter. I love him more and more everyday! Nick also  loves  to stand. And he is doing great at sitting. I am so proud of him. Shawn's coming home today!!! I can hardly wait. Only 2 more hours!!! It has been a  long  4 days without him .
