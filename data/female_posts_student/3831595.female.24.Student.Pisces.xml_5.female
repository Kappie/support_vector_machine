As much as it hurts me to say , I have reached the maximum credit hours allowed by the university and, again,  SADLY  I was unable to register for band. So I have composed a list of things that I will miss for your perusal:  1.  There ya go. And now I will make a rather short list of things that got me through last year: 1. Laughing with Brandon. 2. Text messaging Loni across the band. 3. Trying not to breathe (if you need an explanation,  urlLink email me ). 4. Three words: Symphonic Winds Bingo. 5. Watching Brandon and Johnnie take turns leaving rehearsal. 6. Staring at the clock, trying to determine if it was actually working. 7. Counting how many times I blink in a 2-hour period. 8. Watching Brandon try to pick fights ("Have  you  seen the movie Dr. Karrick?). 9. Being able to actually feel the love for music sucked out of me as we were constantly berated and told exactly why we were never going to amount to anything. 10. Constantly reminding myself that it is almost over.  Can't wait to go back to school...
