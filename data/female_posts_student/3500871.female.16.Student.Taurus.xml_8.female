Well, maybe not easier, but they're really giving me someone to vent to.  Especially Ran and Cordell. Because Ran went through the same thing because Cordell was torn between her and this girl, Ema. He chose Ran! Woot! Ok, anyways... Cordell is Kyle's best friend and so I suppose he's trying to talk to Kyle for me. He's great because he tells me everything. And Ran calls me every day to see how I'm doing and stuff.  They're seriously amazing.  And that's not even with Courtney's support. She constantly tells me that any guy who makes me cry is not worth the tears. She's honestly so great. I don't know what I'd do without those three.  Tabatha really cheers me up too. Just yesterday she said, "I'm soo sorry I didn't raise my son better." (Tab calls Kyle her son because of the fact that she's always telling him to do stuff a mother would do so he started calling her mom)   Yesterday I was talking to Cordell and I was like, "Seriously, tell me. Does Kyle even like me?" and Cordell went, "YEA!?"  I guess it must be a really hard thing for Kyle too, though. Like, he has to deal with the fact that two girls are completely in love with him. One of them being his best friend (me), and the other one being my "best friend". It is quite the situation. So he's not completely to blame. I just kind of wish they'd never met. Then I wouldn't have ever felt ditched or alone and now heartbroken. I guess that's selfish, but I don't care. He's my friend.  But anyways, I was supposed to be talking about how great my friends are... So here I go.  They are amazing and I love them so much. What would I do without my 24/7 Support Line? (ie:Cordell and Ran who have both told me they're here for me no matter what or when)  I think I'm finished for now.
