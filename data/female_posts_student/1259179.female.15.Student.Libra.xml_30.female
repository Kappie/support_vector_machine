She got her results back from her encologist.   IT IS NEGATIVE....  We celebrated by having my Mom teach us how to do our own nails.  My sides still hurt of the laughing fits we had.  My little angel Melanie came with us.  She had a couple of ashtma attacks last night so I kept her home just for precautions. She si doing great now.  I wanted to thank    urlLink   ~ Sue ~    for offering her help for this blog.  Thanks Honey,  Anytime...  you know how blond I am....    So on this friday night, I will relax and enjoy so.............Be Good
