Aiyoh...these few days my mind has been playing tricks on me. Yesterday i had a nightmare tt something terrible happened to bro and he was wheeled into hospital and suddenly i springed out of bed. I also had a nightmare on Sat night, but fortunately i forgot wat it was.  The comp. being in my room isnt a good idea. Sigh...i'm like quite addicted to it. I must NOT go online in the afternoon!! It's for studying! Sigh...i feel like a drug addict.  These few days have been quite sad, since it's raining and all, ppl crying about the musical and about how it's all gone....today we presented our project to mr. tucker and i found it a bit awkward. Thank goodness it's over liao. No more presentations until biotech fair i think, which is in sept. Sigh...not very far away too.  Today's mon and in 5 days time i'll be meeting up wif J.n. I know it's just purely to practise accompanying him for mep, but after all, he's the first boy i'm going out wif. Doesnt mean anything though. But i'll probably rmb it cos it's the first time mah. LoL.  Ly and i dun know wat to dress up as on teacher's day. Hmmm. Fairytale characters...what should i be?
