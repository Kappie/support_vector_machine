Here's a tip when painting someone's room...make sure that the windows are open and DON'T SHUT THE DOOR! lol, me and Em did that, and omg, we were so freaking messed up. We didn't realize anything until we all just started randomly laughing. I was like Kiera, when you paint you need to open windows...plus it didn't help that we just began sniffing the paint cans, lol, then we went and jumped on the trampoline haha, that's so safe, especially when you are like particially high...look at my flip!!! BAM!! You're supposed to stay on the trampoline, lol. Then a few more sniffs later, me and Kiera went to starbucks and hung out. All in all, the day was pretty eventful. I found out something that Kiera did last weekend. I know she did it for me, but I'm still embarrassed about it. Though it really shows how much she cares about me, so Kiera, I LOVE YOU!! Though I really wished David would of told me that Kiera imed him. I didn't find out until yesterday when I was at her house and we opened her log manager and I found the convo and read it. You know I'm really glad when it takes my best friend yelling at my boyfriend to actually get him to IM me. It made me realize that when he imed me last saturday, when I was so upset, that Kiera made him do it, he didn't do it himself...and I saw something he said to Kiera that I seriously thought we were passed. It was about the whole caring part in our relationship, and yea he's told me this before, but I thought we talked it out and everything was ok...But I'm not going to dwell on what happened last week, what's the point? It doesn't change anything...things were said and done and nothing can be taken back, so whatever.   I tried to kill the pain, but only brought more I lay dying and I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming Am I too lost to be saved?
