I am sure that Seside needs a rest from us after all that we did. Sadly we never did get to that documentary that we wanted to do, o well. On the other hand we did do a pretty good job conjuring up fun. My new fav place in Seaside is the adult pool(hehehehehe), though I must admit that I went to the adult pool not only to enjoy the pool, there were a few other reasons (hehehe). O well, we also did very well finding guys, though I have now officaly been branded a boy-crazy girl, even though I am not one. We had a marvelous time with all of them, except one named Joey , and his sister Rachael (whose last names will not be given away for there personal protection, trust me, if you knew what they did you would turn red). I am afraid though that I owe an apology to a certain boy named Stephen, I am so sorry, please forgive me. And also to all the people who I meant to say goodbye to but never got a chance, well a hearty GOODBYE to all. Anyway got to run, going to see a movie.                                   Ciao,                                Natalia                                 (you know you love me)
