We ordered so much sushi and sat there talking and gorging for about 2 hours. Then we headed off to see an afternoon movie - against my choice, we saw Mean Girls.  Not a bad flick but much too teenie bopper for me.  Very gay-boy friendly though and nonetheless we had some laughs. It was so weird to just be hanging out and doing nothing. It's starting to sink in that I have no job right now. I think I am going to go crazy!  Fortunately, or unfortunately, not sure yet, my mother has lined up some work for me at her office.  I will be able to help with some research, filing and other dubhub jobs around her office for about 3-4 days a week starting next Monday. It will be a good opprtunity for me to spend some time with her, learn more about her profession, make some extra cash and more importantly keep me out of trouble.  (I seem so prone to that these days...go figure.)  I don't know about you but I am sick to death of all the rain we have been having.  It isn't suppose to stop raining here until Saturday and I haven't even begun to check the Austin forecast.  I am driving into Austin tomorrow though - going to finally see my AJ after almost 7 months!!!!  I can't wait to see him.  We are planning to go to an afternoon yoga class tomorrow afternoon and do some calorie burning. (luckily!)  Well, no news really here other than that above.  I am enjoying my time at home and resting mostly.  It's tough for me though - I have been waking up every morning at 6:30a.m. - just because my body clock is so off. I am so used to only having 5 1/2 hours sleep a night so when I hit 6, my body just wakes up.  Sucks really bad because I am always really tired in the afternoons.  Oh woe is me. Hahaha.  Lots of love, Shelly
