My soccer team is winning right now-just the way it should be- and so i am really happy right now. I am also talking to this american gal, i dont wanna say names. And i am really happy....soccer team scored again. Now it is 3-0 and i am really happy about that.  Today was a really crappy day outside as it was raining all day long and i was just lying on my bed watching TV and eating. I think i will get fat again as there is nothing to do.
