She's a good kid, but it's such a hassle running around the house, checking up on what she's doing; making sure she isn't sticking her fingers in the outlet,or touching something sharp or whatnot...   *** Watching the 11 o'clock news right now.  Supposedly they're promising thunderstorms tomorrow... If only it be so.  I miss the lighting and thunder and pouring rain...  Reminds me of childhood back in MA.    John Kerry is stopping by tomorrow at the Pioneer Square.  So I'm guessing it'll be really busy downtown tomorrow.  I was thinking of stopping by after school and see what's going on... but apparently they're not allowing backpacks through the gates...  so, I don't know... Tomorrow we'll see....
