A bit random i no but me and samantha mite be going t ostay in a youth hostel at some stage during the summer. Word has it that most people got invited round to jenny's this evening, those who werent on hols or werent already busy. well, i fell into neither of the previous catagories yet i wasnt invited. Thats gratitude for you, i spent ages trying to get hold of people so we could go out, half of them couldnt come so i wasted loads of credit and then they dont even invite me when they all go round someones house. I mean, i could understand if it was just really close people going round, but for god sake, shes invited emma *no offence to emma meant*, but her and emma hardly ever speak. It just seems really strange, i've even started coming up with conspiracy theories aswell, cos samantha and anna havent replied to the texts that i sent them. o well, no one loves, except for the guys last nite trying to save form the little twirps! lol xxx
