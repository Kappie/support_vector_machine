CALM was even fun, me and Andrew talked alot [yeah so me and Andrew went on like one date and that went bad but yeah we are still good friends]  I even for the most part understood my math except for a few questions in the homework which my calc. was being a pain and would not calculte my decimals numbers to fractions.  I even found out Travis kind of likes me and then later and and Chester had one of our "friend" talks although Lenny seems to claim that I was like "trying to pick him up" LOL [that makes me laugh so hard] I have always sorta had this thing for chester but I think we make better friends ya know.  We are just those kind of people.  And well hmmm not sure how the Chem is going now, sometimes it is good, sometimes bad, sometimes just ok.  It's like being on a big roller coaster with all the chem students [I can actually picture that] and like I have people asking ME [yeah me...haha...this is when you laugh] and they were asking Me how to do things.  Ok...ya so I am not the only one who does not understand so I don't feel so bad.  I wish I would have not gone onto the U-courses sight tonight though to check my chem mark.  Down 1% from before [and yeah it may not be a big deal to anyone else but that 1% does happen to be a big deal to me] it was my worst mark and still is.  I HAD  67 but now I have a 66, but I just don't get it - like I am trying and all, going to tutorials, and putting in all my freaking effort, I just don't get WHY WHY WHY chem is not going well.  I feel like I work hard enough and study enough that I really do deserve an 80, of course in a perfect world I probably would get an 80.  Now I really have to think hard though.  I want my dream of being a science teacher more than anything [since I HATE chem now I would probably major in Bio] but well I don't think I could drop chem, besides I am way too far now and all that work for nothing...I don't think so.  I have to pass.  Just keep reassuring myself that I can DO ANYTHING, but it's hard.  I have to ace that unit test on Wednesday, at least get over 70 so my ave. should go up a bit, and over 70 is not an unrealistic goal.  I studied lots on the weekend and will do alot more tommorow night, tonight I just practiced the problems and stuff and worked out the math stuff from this unit.  Yeah well I am pretty happy besides chem, that is the only thing that is really dragging my down right now and upsetting a little part of me.  I will keep working at it though.  I suppose that is all I can do right now.
