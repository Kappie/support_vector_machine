OMG! i duno what to feel. i have mixed emotions of hooking up (being wild) and holding (being caring). like i want those 2. i want ot be wild and free, yet theres a side that wants to settle a little. i duno. but wiht who. like paul ...chris...i duno i duno. theyr both great great guys.   i feel like my past has finally caught up with me. like i use to be soo ahead of the game. like i was able to go make out iwth sumone..then a couple hours later i was with sumone completly different. it was crazy bad. but now its like..im not happy with that anymore. i sorta want more, but i dont want to cry over another guy right now and so soon.   sumthing like that
