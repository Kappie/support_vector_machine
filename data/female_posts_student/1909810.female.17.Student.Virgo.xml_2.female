I finished a painting I had been working on for quite some time, it's not that it took me a long time to do the actual painting, but I painted most of it and then it took me forever to finally paint the rest, I'm satisfied with it :)    and my cat is sitting on top of my monitor right now, she's so cute but one of her paws is like...extremely swollen right now, I think she got stung or bit or something while playing outside, but it doesn't seem to bother her. Wow..I don't know why I like my cat so much, she's odd, and sometimes has the qualities of a dog. You know when you scratch a dog in the right spot their leg gets thumping? I started scratching under her chin and she started doing that..it made me laugh. and now her front half is hanging over the monitor and she's falling asleep.... ah...she's great.
