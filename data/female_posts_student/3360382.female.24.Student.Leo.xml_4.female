The woman's surgery was done at Manatee Memorial Hospital where she was an employee also  at the time of the surgery.  The news report goes on to explain how the news station in Tampa instructed twenty-nine hospitals in Tampa Bay to disclose any information on nosocomial rates in their hospitals.  It also gave information on how there is silence closure when it comes to giving out nosocomial information.  According to the news report the CDC says, "an estimate of 5 percent infection rate nationally in 2001 translates into 2 million patients contracting infections, with 88,000 dying as a result"(multimedia.tbo.com).  As a result of the surgery and infection the woman is suffering from severe body configurations such as:  a disfigured torso and hole in her chest.  The woman is suing her former employer(Manatee Memorial Hospital)and she exclaimed that,"contaminated water fed into the hospital which was the original source of the bacteria"(multimedia.tbo.com).  Ironically, I am currently assigned to a debate topic: (affirmative) Do Healthcare Administrators have an ethical duty to report mistakes?  I stand strong for this argument saying that it is ethical for them report mistakes and in this case if this nosocomial was reported and resolved before these types of cases would not be in courthouse case files today.  Apparently, they are keeping silence due to reputation but infection cases should be handled up front and taking care of immediately and not disclosed.    Laws Shroud Secret Killer In Hospitals.
