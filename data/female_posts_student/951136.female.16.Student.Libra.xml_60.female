ARGH! i found about 5 perfect gifts for ppl i had already boughten stuff for! i was sooo mad! i'm starting a list for birthdays and next year! heheh!! but i still dont have gifts for some of the ppl  i haven't boughten anything for. tough luck.  i was making a cold play cd, and i was up stairs doing somehting nad my mother comes in and closes the program IN THE MIDDLE OF IT BURNING!....computer-illiterate ppl make me sick! sick. so now i have 6 songs and 3 seconds of everythings not lost. godnabit. i saw something to day that almost made me cry. I was leaving the parking lot and i saw this couple walking into the store. the guy was cute. he was tallish and skinny, a little muscle. he looked nice. and his girlfriend... she was short, and fat. like her lower stomache went out farther than her boobs...i didn't see her face really. but they were walking, and he put his arm around her sholders. and pulled her towards him. and he was looking at her while walking. adn then leaned into kiss her completely devoid of where they were walking. it was so cute. she must be so special. it made me almost cry there in the car w. my dad. just a few things you see in life change you... adios --- i hate spanish.
