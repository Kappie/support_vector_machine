I mean at dinner tonight, my father and I just sat there staring at the wall. He's probably thinking of more ways to repeat himself. So damn boring. So damn slow. So freaking boring. I can't stand him. At least with Mom, I'm in a freaking good mood.   I can't stand to be around my father. So damn boring. I can't stand him.
