I've been thinking all along that I need to be Mike's friend in order to help him.  B pointed out to my last night (and the night before) that not communicating to him would be best for him and for me.  It would force him to consider why all his "friends" are avoiding him and eliminate a source of stress for me at the same time.  I'm glad that B pointed this out, because I had never considered this point of view before, but I see now why this is true.  So I've basically decided not to communicate with Mike anymore at all.  So, problem solved, right?  I was totally ready to leave this topic behind, but B didn't seem as ready to move on. He seemed really troubled that I would be willing to "hurt" myself if it meant helping someone or making someone happy. It's true that this part of my personality resulted in an unhealthy relationship with Jerry (among other factors), and this is something that I need to work on.  Given that, I was really hoping that B would be willing to work with me on this and keep me from making similar unhealthy decisions in the future. Afterall, that's what friends do, right?  Instead, he thought that maybe it's not healthy for both of us to be in this relationship while I'm working on my "self-preservation" skills (as opposed to expending myself for others).  It seemed like he was applying this weakness of mine to ALL areas of my life--as if this weakness is an indication of who I am as a whole person.  I tried to tell him that this weakness is a SMALL SMALL part of who I am and all I need is help and encouragement from him and my other friends to overcome this.    What troubles me is that he was so QUICK to doubt the future of our relationship when he found out that I have this fault.  Is our relationship so fragile?!?!  I asked him if he would be willing to help and encourage me or if this was something that he can't handle about me (which would mean an inevitable breakup).  What he said completely shocked me.  He said, "I DON'T KNOW".  Why doesn't he know whether he wants to work with me on this?  Why is he so surprised that I have faults!?!  I was really hoping that when these faults surfaced, he would want to be my source of strength.  Why isn't he sure if he wants to play this role?  If my boyfriend isn't sure if he wants to encourage me, who else on earth do I have?? There are big tears in my eyes right now because it breaks my heart that he would have so little faith in our relationship and most of all, that he doesn't want to help me with my weaknesses.  I have so many of them, and what will happen when he discovers those too?    He said that sometimes he thinks that we are so different. It's true that we are different, but I think that ADDS to our relationship, not detracts from it.  I feel like I can constantly learn from him because of our differences, and I'm very interested in what he has to say.  He called me "stubborn", which is true, but I don't think I was being stubborn with him at that time.  I was just trying to make sure that he understood my point of view.  He doesn't have to agree with it.  If I were truely stubborn, then I wouldn't have even listened to him when he pointed out that not talking to Mike would be best for both of us.  Instead, I DID listen and I even ended up agreeing with him.  Maybe he thought that I was only agreeing with him because I wanted to make him happy, not because that's what I truely believed.  But that's not true!  I really believe for myself that talking to Mike isn't healthy and that's why I've made that decision.  It's true that I am influenced by people, but I also am capable of making my own decisions.  How could I be a good vet if I weren't capable of making independant decisions!?!    Despite all of this, I still want to be his girl. Even when I was expressing my opinions, B still listened well (at least in the beginning when he wasn't that sleepy).  He never raised his voice at me, although I could tell there was frustration in his voice.  He ultimately wants what's best for me. I know that he was frustrated because he doesn't want to see me hurt anymore.  But I do hope that he will develop more tenacity when it comes to our relationship and not be so quick to doubt its "rightness" when our differences surface (which they inevitably will). Does this mean that he's trying to find any excuse to break up with me?  I didn't think so because he's so good about telling me how happy he is with me and how amazing it is that we're together.  I didn't think he was that unhappy with me...but then why would he even suggest that we break up?  The very thought makes me want to cry, but most of all, I want to talk to him.  I hope he calls me soon....
