I am only talking to one person on MSN, and it's a real person (as opposed to someone I don't really know), so it's not nearly as interesting. For one thing, I cannot have deeply educational conversations about the differences between the public school systems of the US and those of the Netherlands.   Thank you, Ilke!  Anyway, I thought I would come on here and write a nice rant about why my love like sucks. Here is a list:  1. I DON'T HAVE ONE.  There, wasn't that a lovely list?  So, in an attempt to analyze myself (or, more specifically, why I lack a romantic entanglement of any kind), I made another list. This is a list of the reasons I feel are responsible for my non-love life:  1. Lack of physical beauty.  ~Analysis: While I am no Liv Tyler, I don't really think I'm dog-ugly, either. Of course, most boys my age are much more interested in facial characteristics than personality, so that could be a contributing factor.  2. Shyness.  ~Entirely my fault, and entirely true. See previous post, in which I practically beg everyone who reads it not to tell 'Eddie' that I like him. NOBODY KNOWS WHO EDDIE IS! I am paranoid! This cannot be healthy! I have this huge fear of rejection (which I have been blaming on Sarah Whisler and Erin Lomasney for five years, which is also unhealthy, I'm sure) that keeps me from flirting or doing anything that might let guys know I am interested in them. Gaah. Except, apparently, for young men who work at Subway. Perhaps there is a strange forcefield around Subway restaurants that inhibits my shy aura?  3. Off-putting intellect.  ~AKA: I am a know-it-all, sarcastic bitch.  OK, this one is self-explainatory, and I really can't refute it in any way.  Damnit, I'm not supposed to cuss anymore.   All right, that's about all I can think of right now. If anyone is reading this, I would appreciate any input that is not a carefully calculated compliment designed to make me feel better about myself. :D
