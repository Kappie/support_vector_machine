Hehee... cant blame me,pple will be LAZY at certain times.Lets talk,i was suppose to go out with sheila,farezah and batu to watch SPIDER-man two.Yah, in the end it was cancel becos someone got to eat maggie mee to save up $$ to buy tickets.But i dun blame her lah cos she had spent her daily allowance on her recess.Haha.. i hope she will read my entry.On the last saturday, I went to cut hair,oh man, that hair stylist was like pronounce my name wrongly.But he did a good job as he cut my hair until very NICE.I am falling in love with my hair.Wow wow wow,then on the actual day i wore skirt it was like so uncomfortable cos i am used to sit very roughly ya.Then went CHIJMES, it was like wasting time there somemore so HOT!! But i did a good deed as i donated $0.70. Haha... Later went to Orchard for dinner,end up no time as i need to go home early ya.Change subject now.I miss my daddy!! Hehee.. Without him around at home, i cant come home late when i go out,not enough $$ to spend and i miss his nagging.Haha.. i know i am weird ya.  I felt that i am treating her very cold as i try to avoid her as much as i can.I know how she treats me, it just that Xinxin told me before no breaking up friendship. Ya,pple did ask me why she treat me like that and somemore i can tolerate.I dun feel like searching for the answer in my heart cos i will be sad when i find it.Dun talk abt her lah.'Clique' hmmm... i dun noe whether i should give up hope anot cos it is like everyone seems like wanting to split.I really agree on what Zenn say'Friends better dun talk abt love relationship between each other cos it will only strain the friendship' Ya.I hope the both of them to be friends back although they are not together cos i dun think it is worth to lose a friend if he/she is a good friend.Ya,batu told me she think it is worth to lose a friend if that person is bad. But i wonder what if one day, you need that person's help how are you gonna to ask for the help? Yup. I think thats all.I will always sit beside my bed everynight to pray that nothing will let us decide on the worst decision as to split cos i dun think it is worth just becos of some stupid reasons ya.Sheila, i hope this is my lastes ENTRY not a month ago. ok...
