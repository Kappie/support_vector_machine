First, there was the guy who was next to me on the train who was sleeping.  As he drifted off into the world of slumber, he slid to the side so that he was leaning on me.  Normally, I do not like such invasions of my space, but he smelled of sweet tobacco, and he was tired, so I didn't mind so much.  It's not like he did it on purpose.  Eventually, he woke up and sat back up straight, and it didn't happen again; when I got the chance, I slid down a little bit so that I wasn't right up next to him, so that he would have space to sleep and I would have space to read for Torts.  This is one of those "New York Moments" that some people find endearing, others find revolting, and I am growing increasingly ambivalent about the longer I live in New York City.    Then, after I departed the F train and made my way down the surly streets to my apartment, I saw the Christmas decorations were up at Bloomingdales.  I'd never seen them before.  They have strings of white lights dangling, forming a sheet across the top of the building; they also have large wreaths filled with red lights.  As I saw this, it suddenly hit me that Thanksgiving is almost here, and that with that, Christmas cannot be far behind.  I suddenly got very scared, since this really drove home the point that finals season is upon me, and I'm woefully unprepared for any of them.  It also made me feel a little...well, I guess nostalgic is the best description, since I usually call it depression, but that doesn't quite capture the feeling, for it is happy at the same time it is sad...for Christmas season, since it is my favorite time of year.  It also made me realize how much I miss my family, who are all back home in Mississippi.   Then, as I turned my attention from the decorations to the people walking down the sidewalk in opposition to me, I noticed that there were an inordinate number of couples walking down the street.  Now, this depressed me, but I will not linger on it; I will only say that it didn't depress me as much as it should have.  I've been alone for a while now, so I guess I've just gotten used to it, and while there are times I long for something more, I realize it isn't going to happen to me any time soon, so I've just accepted it and moved on.  As wise religious folk say:  "It's in God's hands."  So, how's that for not lingering on it?
