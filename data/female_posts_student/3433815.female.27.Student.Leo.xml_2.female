Mom is back in the hospital (eww, HATE hospitals!) so she has a "procedure" to go through this afternoon, and was thinking it would be really cool if everyone / anyone would just think in some positive way (or wish, or pray - if you do that.)I just don't want the outcome to be bad. And to those out there, you know who you are, it was nice of you to pretend to care for the moment. I know you have your attitude prob and think that everyone is below you, just because people are fat, or don't take care of themselves. well how does that involve you? it doesn't. If its a smell issue then don't breathe, if its a sight issue, then don't look. OUR parents, are OUR parents. A person can say anything they want of feel anyway about their  OWN  parents, its their right, but if anyone else has an issue; too fat, smelly, etc. then thats your probelm and I nor anyone else wants to hear it. Its just rude. If you can look in the mirror a find no problem or flaw then, maybe then, you can have your opinion, otherwise keep it to yourself.  have another one.
