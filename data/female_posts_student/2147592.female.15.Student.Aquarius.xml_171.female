Oh well...it had lasted a whole month *wipes tear* well yeah, I read a bit...then we went downstairs and munched! We went Pig's later and just hung out really, edited out sites so thats pretty cool. Me and Pig were in hystericas due to a song that had been sent...I think it's really starting to get lame finding the word "poo" funny at 15 years old...  Well yeah, I'm being distracted by seeing Angy on webcam, so I must make like a quiche...and bake :| Toodlepipxxxxxxxxxx OH YEAH! MWAHAHAHAHAHA, PIG FINDS THE WORD "POO" FUNNY AT 16 MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! HA! It's broadcasted on the internet...
