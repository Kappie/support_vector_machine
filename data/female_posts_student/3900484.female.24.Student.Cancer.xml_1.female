I don't think I've ever sounded as girly as I do on this thing.  I should talk about volunteering more.  And the snakes and junk.  Machoness.  Right now I stink.  Is that macho? I just got done with my evening run, which I think could have been a little longer...but, oh well.  So now I smell.  In fact, I should maybe take a shower.  STOP FANTASIZING ABOUT ME!!  Im a sweaty stinky girl and I don't want you thinking about me in that way. I apologize.  I just always wanted to say that.  So I can live with just typing it.  2 things kept running through my head as I was running tonight.  I'll share one with you.  I think I have magical powers.  See, our ice machine at work has been leaking, and today it stopped, while I was opening the shop.  So I figure, it must have been my magic.  Working without me knowing.  Oh Oh and then, the email that I received from the prof.  I got that right as I was thinking about sending another email.  So again.  Magic.  OH and my zoo person emailing me back...I am so good that I do this stuff with out even knowing it.  Now I just have to decide whether to use my powers for good or evil.  I call a vote.  With my one reader...
