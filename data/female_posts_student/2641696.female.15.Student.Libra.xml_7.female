Fortunately, I was basically soapless by that point, but the sudden darkness and the blast of cold water from the shower didn't make it seem like heaven, either. I slipped in the tub and now my knee has an awful bruise on it, fell on the floor, thankfully landing on my towel. Now, have you any idea how difficult it is to find a doorknob with no light? I must have spent five minutes simply feeling up the door. I get the door open, realize the towel had fallen while I was fumbling, curse, and swiftly pull the towel back up around my chest again.   I don't  think  anyone saw.   It'd be hard to tell in the darkness anyways. I could just say I dropped my ring; the towel was there the whole time.   Needless to say, I'm rather traumatized at the moment, and because of the black-out, I'm not going to school. Yay. So you'll be getting a few more blogs today, since I'm bored out of my wits and undoubtedly will have more to complain about :)
