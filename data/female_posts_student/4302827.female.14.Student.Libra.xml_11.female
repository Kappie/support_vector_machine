My power went out because my mom did something weird with a power saw and screwed up a bunch of fuses. Yes, a power saw. I am not too sure what she was up to and I'm kind of scared to find out. The power came back on about an hour ago so I guess it's all good. At least I have my computer back.  I decided to clean the house because I need money to buy my mother a birthday present. As I was cleaning  the kitchen I came across a half digested, decomposing sock on the counter. Yes, on the counter. What could be more repulsive? Think of the bacteria! It turned out to be my mothers sock. If I put socks that looked like that, well make that any socks at all, on the counter my mother would have got out that fuse blowing power saw and chopped me into bits with it.  I just read Shannons post about all the damn party/sex/drugs/alcohol people and I agree. It is rather moronic the way these people slowly kill them selves with herpes and other such sexually transmitted diseases through sex and drug use. But it's their choice. As long as I don't do it, or at least do it safely, I could care less about all the stupid bimbos out there. I'm not saying I'm all anti-drugs and drinking and such. I'm just saying the least they could do is be smart about it. Must you get pissed, do something stupid and pass out on the street much like the guy under cassandra's car? No. Thats just stupidity. I guess stupidity is a large part of most peoples lives these days.  Now that I'm done ranting and bitching I should probably go eat, I didn't get a chance to eat supper due to the fact that my mother was screwing around with the damn power saw.
