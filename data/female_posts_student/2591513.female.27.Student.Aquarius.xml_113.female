I wouldn't trade any of those memories for anything...good and even bad.  These people were such a huge factor in me and who I am today, I will not go and pretend they weren't.  A lot of what I know about being a friend was taught to me by them and a lot of the things I learned about what a friend should not be was learned through my relationship with them.  For whatever shortcomings, I am sorry.  No excuse but the fact of plain ignorance.  Health scares certainly put things in perspective, but maybe it was too late anyhow, maybe it has been too late for so many years now and I just didn't want to admit it.  But I will not regret holding on to something so precious to me, I am sorry only that it was taken for granted.  In life you win some and lose some, I was glad to ahve won the time I had with them and sad that I have lost a future with them.  Who knows with time, maybe it will heal wounds.  I hope so because they are important to my first born.  Sorry for all this.  I guess I blog this because one, I can't really let them know my intentions because they don't return calls or e-mails....and I wanted to make myself clear that I am changing my ways and that I admit how superficial and controlling I have been in the past and I regret the hurt it has caused.  Maybe it is also in hopes that one day they come across my blog and realize how much I miss them.  Either way, it is an easy to get thigns off my chest.  Onto other things...  Abigail (my cousin via Uncle Tunying) is spending 1-2 weeks with us.  It is nice to have her come over.  I remmeber wanting to be around my relatives growing up, so I am glad she has this opportunity to be around family.  Sometimes it is funny, sometimes stressful and many times hard, but well worth it.  Ed will be home in less than a day.  I can't wait.  I miss him when he is gone.  He hasn't been gone like this since Kuwait.  A HUGE part of me is going to be sad when he leaves and scared, but I have faith in his abilities and that God has a plan.  I believe that Ed will do great things in life and show everyone who ever doubted him that he is capable of being a good person and do big things.  I can see it.  I better go to bed.  I have to take my dad to his physical...well I don't HAVE to, but I want to so I can make it down to IKEA to buy the shelves Ed has wanted for awhile.  Have a good week everyone!
