So she hit me and I ran into the laundry room and cried and scratched for a really long time and now I have to aweful scratches on my arms and it looks like I'm suicidal or I'm looking for attention, and that isn't it at all!  It just felt good at the time!  Then Ana told them that I wasn't lying and they let me go to Lori's house!  When I got there Frank, Lani, Bob, Karina, and Lori were all sitting on the couch in the dark, watching Texas Chainsaw Masacre!  I only saw the end of it, but what I saw I thought was really funny!  I don't know why everyone was so scared of it!  Then we played in the basement for a long time and Bob left for a bit because he made Lani cry and she told him to go!  Then he came back!  Me, Karina, and Lori made paper clip necklaces and they are OMG, so cool!  Just watch, everyone WILL copy off of us and come to school wearing them on Wednesday!  Then we went to Diary Queen and I got yummy peanut buster parfait and it reminded me of Ryan because after the show on Wednesday we all went to Dairy Queen and thats what I got and yeah!  Then we parked by the river for a bit, and it got boring so Karina took us back to Lori's house!   Me and Bob had a bit of fun!  But I don't know, I don't think I like him anymore!  I thought I really did, but I didn't feel the WAM BAM JAM that I used to feel!  Oh well, that's ok!   Then Bob left and Steve came home!  YAY!  Ummm ... Steve hung out in the basement with me and Lori and watched Elephant!  It was a weird movie about a school shooting, I liked it a lot!  Then we slept and Steve slept with us for awhile, and it was fun mucho!  Ummm ... Hank came over in the morning and it was happy because Hank is awesome and hott, and OW OW!  Then my mom picked me up around 12 30 and we went to Target and she bought me a lot of fun things!  Yay!    Hanging out with Amanda and Cousins AND/OR Lori and Frank tonight!
