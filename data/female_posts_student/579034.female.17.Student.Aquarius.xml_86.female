We will never forget the good times we have all shared together. We will be taking with us the happy memories of cutting open Lauren's mouth, making indents on the inside of her mouth, making food get lodged inbetween our brackets and having Lauren look incredibly stupid tryin to pick it out. Along with that goes the countless times Lauren has almost choked and died on the wax she tried to put on us to hurt her less. Ah... good times, good times.      We hope our legacy will live on forever (and ever amen) as Lauren grows into her new and improved teeth. Maybe now Lauren won't have to cut things (like chicken fingers, pizza, and mozzerella sticks) in fear that tiny little parts of the food she is eating will get stuck in us. And who knows! Maybe, JUST MAYBE when we are gone, Lauren will become more attractive and not look like a 12 year old (us and the freckles combined make a mean team in making Lauren not look almost 17).      So farewell, and good riddence.                                 - Lauren's Upper Braces
