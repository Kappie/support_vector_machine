It makes me enjoy a bit of calm and peacefulness once in a while. You'd think I'd be running on all the caffeine I downed this morning...but I'm just really mellow and content. It's nice. I think I'm gonna have lunch in a bit, and then find something to do, because I don't really feel like sitting at home by myself today. This is the kind of day that I like to spend with people. Well, time for food.  *~~ :-) ~~*
