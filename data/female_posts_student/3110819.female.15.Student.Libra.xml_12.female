I went home and took Motrin, which helped. I had taekwondo monday night, and i ripped some of my nail off. Bloody mess. Literally. Hurt like hell, I might add.  Tuesday, school. We had these army guys come and teach us 'self defense'. It was a joke. Like, we did everything once, not like I need much more self-defense training, but nobody w/o training is gonna remember. I blew off my clarinet lesson, which backfired, as my mom and my teacher found out. My mom gave me this big lecture on responsibility. Screw responsibility. One Tree Hill was pretty good. I don't really feel like talking about it though.  Oh, and, screw the government. They suck. Get us into wars, kill people with the death penalty, abortion. Keep secrets, and kill more people to keep those secrets. What brings this on, you ask? Well, I already thought they always talked BS, but after watching some movies in history about the death of JFK, they officially suck. Royally. Anyway, I firmly believe we need Bush outta office. Not that I like Edwards or Kerry.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My ideal candidate:  -agianst death penalty  -pro-life  -get us outta iraq  -get us in no more wars  -agianst gay marraige (nothing personal, just don't think ya'll should be married. i'm good w/ civil unions) -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Crap. Just found out I've got surgery on the 12th of May. If it interferes w/ the ONLY history trip this yr. (which will be a blast btw) I am going to be royally pissed off. Plus I've got 2 doctors appts next friday for pre-surgery. waaaahhhhh!!!  School was crap today. Luckily I've got Angel tonight to help me throught the next hour of studying.
