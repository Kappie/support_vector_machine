I'm just too restless now and I have a bad feeling that I'm falling sick - shivering and hot all over, sounds like fever, doesn't it?   This pig woke up past 11am this morning and was pleasantly surprised to find everyone else gone. Apparently, they couldn't wait for me to wake up to make plans for the day. Can't blame them though =)  Anyway, lunch was awesome. Mom and I went to Woods, and ordered so much that by the time we're done, well, let 's just say we were really stuffed. Not many people go there even though I absolutely love the food there. Only those who are vegetarians, weigh-watchers and health-conscious ones do. OH, and lots of medical people like doctors and such eat there too. Well, I am there cuz I like food bland (or untasty).. no sugar, salt, seasoning...blabla..Most people think Im crazy but that's my preference. Food  au naturale  is the best. That doesn't mean I do not like chocolates or ice-cream, ha-ha.  The whole afternoon was spent in 1U, yes, that's my second home lol. I swear, the whole of KL were there and the place was just packed wall to wall!! I couldn't even do my shopping in peace and pretty soon I developed a nasty headache from the lack of oxygen. Pretty sad outcome too - I didn't get anything! There was this beautiful black dress in Rest which made me look like a mermaid and it was 50% off and I was tempted to get it but then I thought, when will I wear it? Prom? That's lightyears away and besides, I wanna wear something purply to Prom, not black.   We decided on Kogetsu on lunch tomorrow so dinner tonight was really light. We had mamak at Munis and of all luck, we were 'served' by a really dumb waiter who messed up our order. My dinner came in the form of some cheese or butter naan when I had clearly stated plain naan, so we had to send it back and I was so hungry at that time already and practically downed my gallon of Mango Special. Well, don't blame me for getting all bloated later. haha.   I just realized something. Cole hasn't called yet today and I didn't hear from him. Unless, of course, you count the sms asking me to watch mtv cuz Jake Gylenhaal was on but, really. This is starting to become..a routine. I mean, when I tell him about it, like I wanna hear from him everyday, then it'll be alright for a while. But then after a few weeks, he does it again. I dunno if he's trying to tell me that I need to remind him every few weeks. Frankly, this is  bullshit . You don't need reminding for this kind of things, do you? *shakes head* I just can't believe it. The last time this happened a few weeks ago, he told me that if I do not call him by the end of the day, then he will call me. Did he tonight? No. And to add salt to the wound, today's our 3-month anniversary. How could he do this to me on our anniversary?? I don't get it. Think I'll go bawl out my eyes now. Yeah right. Guys are not worth our tears and I won't be taken for granted anymore.
