So today I had to make some and I was going crazy. Instead of getting the kind of rye flour we normally have, my mother got some kind of natural...stone ground..whatever..rye flour. And every single freakin' time I tried to use the cookie-cutter to get a dogbone out of the mess...it would crumble apart.   So. I spent an hour..an  hour ..trying to make dogbones. Eventually, my mom went downstairs so I just got the dough together and threw it out in the trashcan. ^^;  I was so ticked off, though. When I was yelling at the dogbones and my mom finally came to see what the matter was, she automatically asked if I measured everything right and..oy. That just made me so angry. Of course I measured everything right. I'm not like my sister, who just guesses at all the measurements and does everything wrong when it comes to cooking. I try to be as precise as possible. I'm a perfectionist, after all.  Enough of that.  For some good news..my other sister is coming into town! Yay! Aaron's coming by on Friday, hopefully, and we can just talk and play games and do stupid stuff like sing along to that yellow submarine song by the Beatles. heh. Or maybe I could get him to let me on his AIM name so I can confuse his friends. Ah..good times...good times....  For some bad news...I'm going to try and pry myself away from RuneScape. Ok, that's not really bad news. But it's going to be hard for me. I finally got the picture after  somebody  sent me this  urlLink guilt-inducing slashdot article.   I think it's kind of funny, how this relationship is..I'm the gamer..and Jacob just isn't really a gamer. But...I've been thinking about it..it's a good thing that I'm not dating a gamer. I mean, I already have a hard enough time getting myself away from games. If I had a boyfriend who was a gamer..well..he'd just encourage the gaming and wouldn't help the addiction-to-games situation at all, I guess.   Oh well. I just know that I need to get away from RuneScape through my own strength of will. Jacob refuses to yell at me when I play RuneScape, unfortunately. I knew if I got him to "yell" at me, it would distract me from the game and I would be able to realize that I should talk to him instead of waste my life to a stupid, pointless game...  I'm also getting quite tired of being asking if I am actually a female on RuneScape. "omg asl?//"...the phrase is getting a little aggravating by now. Of course, there was the time that one person kept asking me to be their girlfriend and when I said no, because I already have a boyfriend.."o its ok, tho, u can have 2 bfs. i wont tell any1. it can b a secret" That made me laugh a lot.  Ah, and if you didn't know, I have a boyfriend. His name is Jacob. He's an oxymoron. ^_^  Oooh. Lunch. Ok. Food > blog. Yeah. Math. I hate math. But..that equation is appropriate...
