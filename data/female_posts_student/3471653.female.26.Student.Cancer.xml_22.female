I've heard him grumbled about by lots of Anglicans on my side of the hue and cry, but I think that's a little hasty.    He says, "Something that one theologian said, 50 years ago, that the Christian is always a bad political ally, because you don't know quite when you're going to run into some point of reference, some standard which doesn't just come from the general cultural consensus."  Would our own presiding bishop Griswold say that kind of thing?      Notice also that +Cantuar loves Bach and Dostoevsky, always a good sign--  Just so you know, almost every Anglican link that's posted comes from Todd Granger.  See below for details.
