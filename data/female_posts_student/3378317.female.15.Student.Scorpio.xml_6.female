WAS chillen wit Tom until he had to switch seats. stupid teacher thinks that when hes reading to me whats on the board that we're jus wasting time. dumb bitch.  dad still hasnt looked at me once.  today is Day 4 of wishing i was dead.  last night i went over to Rekha auntie's (my god-mom) house and told her everything that happened on friday and she talked to me.  its so sad, she knows me better than my mom.  talked to mandeep on the phone yesterday,  i tried not to cry on the phone but i couldnt help it.  i am so glad he has been with me all the way.    yes im still going to try to go to UCLA Bruin Bhangra but i doubt it very much. still trying.  talked to balraj this morning and told him bout Ramandeep, so on friday Rekha auntie, mehek, manny, raman, his mom, and mammiji might go hang out at the mall. and balraj and raman will be able to meet for the first time.    raman has finished 11th grade, he says "whats the point of going to skool for one more year...im jus going to work at uncle's subway in seattle anyway.." i really want him to finish at reseda and go to college with me, he'll be much better off. i never thought we would meet after those 3 summers and here he is..right across the street from me. haa..coo.  parents have me on check 24/7 and i dont know what to do. i dont want to eat dinner with them because all i hear is the sound of my spoon hitting my plate.   yesterday was by far the worst piano recital i have ever had.    friday- i thought nothing could go wrong and everything went wrong that day. i couldnt see the 1 person that makes me feel alive, who makes me feel like im a gem..like im the best. who makes me feel sane, makes me feel good about myself mandeep im so sorry.  i feel like i cant breathe at home, feel suffocated.  today a few friends asked..."how was it on friday?!!" i just shook my head. i didnt know what to say, i felt like crying but i was able to hold it in.  summer school with mandeep would have been awesome, i cant even imagine what my parents reaction would be if i ask again.   'Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small'  What happened to the Angel of the Battlefield?? she's gone.  peace.
