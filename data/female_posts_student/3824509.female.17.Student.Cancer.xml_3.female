SO I have decided from now on I will NOT get emotional and just let life take me where it wants to. But anyway life is more complicated then needed. Good news is I think I finally found someone I can trust and that makes life all the better.Nice to know you have somthing real to depend on. Hmmm but on to not being so serious. I went fishing and caught 2 fish! :) I also finally finished lifeguard......But yeah just got yelled at so I'm done here. Sometimes I wonder why I am even here
