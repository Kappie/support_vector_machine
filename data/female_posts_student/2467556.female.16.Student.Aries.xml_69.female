This is where the famous Coors Light "Here's to Love Songs" commercial came out, one of my fave commercials besides the Wingman commercial.  Oh yeah, and 2 really good football teams play to figure out who's champion.  Since i don't know all that much about football, i'm just going to cheer for the Patriots because a) they're Britt's fave team and b) if i don't Britt will kill me.  So yeah, go Patriots!  After i eat some of my parents' party food, i'm going to Brittany's house to "watch" the game.  Its bound to be one hell of a party.   OMG STARS WIN LAST NIGHT OVER PHEONIX!!!!!  5-4 BABY!!!  And my Niko got an assist AND he hit someone really hard!!!!  And Brendan Morrow (he's sooo adorable!) got a hat trick!!!!!  It was sooo awesome!!!!  Oh yeah and my fave (and the hottest) player on Pheonix, Shane Doan, scored a goal also.  It was great.  We didn't have to go into overtime or anything.  But it always seemed like everytime Dallas got an insurance goal on Pheonix, Pheonix scored and put it back to a one goal lead.  Crazy!  My Niko looked sooooo adorable when after he helped Brendan get a goal and they were all hitting each other's heads/male bonding.  He looked so happy!  and you know whats even better? San Jose lost in overtime, which makes us only 3 pts away from taking them over!!!  But LA beat Edmonton in overtime, which sucks but thats ok!  hmmmm....i went to church today, it was cool.  I had to apologize to my friend Jake Ross because on Tuesday or something i accidently called him Kyle....randomly! he said it was no big deal or anything, but i felt really bad.  But its ok, he forgave me, lol!  lalalalala i think i'm going to enjoy my NEW NHL CENTER ICE PACKAGE!!!!   The package that allows me to watch EVERY FREAKING GAME IN THE NHL.  Its awesome.  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
