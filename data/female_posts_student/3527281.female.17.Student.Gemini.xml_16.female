Here it is:  Friday: My frist official day of summer. We went to Medina to go see the third Harry Potter movie. Then I went to Leanne's graduation party with Holly. It was fun. Then I came home.  Saturday: I had to wake up early in order to leave the house by 10:30. So I dropped Dad off at church for brass practice, while Mom and I went to the Carpenter Shop near AU to look for graduation presents. Then we swung back by the church to get Dad, then went home. When I got there, LeeAnne, Wanda, and Holly were already there waiting for me so we could leave to go party hopping all together. First we went to Christa's, which was back at my church. Then we went to the place were the Haunted Woods are in Ashland because we thought Nic Schwan's was there that day. So we get there and there's this whole luau theme going on and we're all like, "Hmmm...we didn't know Nic liked Hawaii." So we walk into the building there and we're like "Hmmm....why is Helana and her family here?? Where's Nic's family?? Why are there pictures of Helana everywh--....Oh no..." Yep, turns out Nic's is NEXT weekend. It wasn't Saturday. So we ended up at Helana's graduation party-- an hour and a half early. Whoops. So we looked at pictures for a little bit and got out of there!! It was quite funny. So then we went to Cory's, Tiffany Kidd's, and then LeeAnne's. We were at LeeAnne's the longest probably. It was a lot of fun. She had this huge pig though for the dinner, and its head was still on because it's good luck. Interesting, eh? We sang karaoke over there so that was a lot of fun. So after a lot of that, we went to Joe House's, and then to the Poynters' and Buzz's. We played volleyball at Buzz's until it got dark and left shortly after that. I just wanted to get home because one of my friends (not going to name who) has been driving me nuts lately so I kind've wanted to get away from her.  Sunday: Was an interesting day in several aspects. First I had to get up early enough so I could actually be ready in time to get to church about 45 minutes early and also so I looked good enough for graduation. Well I was ready in time but when I put my button up white shirt on, there was a spot where the material was wearing thin, so I was not happy, to say the least, and I had no time to find another shirt. So I was really frustrated, and usually when I get frustrated I get really mad and yell at someone, but instead, I was crying. Over a hole. Yes, I know, crazy. But I was stressed from my "friend" the night before and then this and graduation and everything. So I was crying for a while and we got to church and I was still somewhat upset because I felt really dumb with this hole in my shirt. There was this music group at our church that day though, "Tim Zimmerman's King Brass," so when I was walking in to sit down one of the guys in the group was grabbing his trombone from the pew and walking away and he kind've looked at me like "ehh..? what's wrong?" (and he was kind've cute too, I might add). So when the service finally started I was calmed down. The Trinity Brass (which is the brass group at my church, which my dad is in) got to play with this group and they were awesome! The music was wonderful. I was just so amazed at how good they were. It was awesome. So I felt great after church because the sermon was good and all the music was great. So after church we walk back in because Dad wants to buy a CD from this group and the cute guy from the beginning is the one standing by the stand with the CDs on it. So I told him they did an amazing job and it was just wonderful. And he was saying thanks and stuff. And he was really cute. And he even smiled at me and everything. And he was saying how great it was to be here and stuff...so yeah, after church I was in an extremely good mood. Then my family and my grandparents went to eat at Jake's after church. And after I ate quickly, I drove off to the HS for graduation. Graduation went well and I'm surprised I didn't cry. Really surprised. I thought for a moment that I might while we sang "Remember," but I told myself to not thing about the meaning of what I was singing, just sing the words. So thankfully I didn't cry. It was a nice ceremony though. I am going to miss the seniors so much, especially LeeAnne. So after that I went home and Holly and LeeAnne came over around 4:30 and we went to go to more graduation parties. We went to: Cody's, Carinna's, Neil's, Sherisa's, and then Brad's. We were supposed to go to Joel's and Mandy's, but we ended up staying at Brad's for like 3 hours. We played volleyball there too until we couldn't see the ball too well. Then I finally came home.  Monday: I woke up around 10:00 and started packing and getting ready to go to my grandparents' house in Brunswick. We left around 11:00 to meet them at Wendy's by the Outlet Mall because that is "the halfway point." So after eating, I left with my grandparents. We dropped my grandpa off at their house and then my grandma and I went shopping at the Strongsville Mall for my birthday. I found some cute stuff and then we went to Target to look at CDs and stuff. And then we met my grandpa at TGIFridays because I got to pick where we ate dinner, and I picked there obviously. For each of us kids, my grandma takes us shopping before our birthday to find clothes and stuff and when we find something, she buys it. And then she decides what to actually give us and take back because you know grandmas can't find the stuff we like half the time, so this way, we know we'll get what we do like. So after that my grandma and I went to Borders because I just had to go to a book store and I bought two books there. I'm so excited to be reading my first book of the summer. I'll write a review of it when I'm done. And I bought a book with craft ideas and such. So after that, we finally went back to their house. My grandpa was watching TV, so my grandma and I played this word game with cubes and then this older game called Careers. It was quite a game let me tell ya. It was funny. Then we all had ice cream and talked and such, and then we went to bed.  Tuesday: I slept in until almost 11:00 and we had waffles with bacon in the morning for breakfast (it was good). Then I took a shower and everything and I called my friend who lives up there to see if she wanted to get together while my grandma took my grandpa to his eye appointment. She wasn't home, but was going to call me back. But then I started feeling kind've sick, bad cramps, so we decided to go home early. So I got home and did nothing pretty much because I felt awful.  Today: WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO BLOODY MUGGY?! Ugh...it's awful. It was so hot and gross today. I slept in pretty late again today. So eventually after getting up and eating breakfast, my mom, brothers, and I went into the basement to sort out some stuff for a garage sale we're having this Friday (come if you wanna buy something good!!). Then I took a cold shower because it's too hot. Even after the shower, I still felt gross. So I hung out in the basement because it's about 10 degrees cooler down there. I had lunch and watched TV and did my hair down there. Then my mom and I went shopping in Wooster for my birthday. I found some cute clothes and stuff. We went out to eat at El Canelos. It was good. Then we went to Wal-Mart to look at stuff. I bought some fabric and ribbon and stuff for a purse I'm going to make using that book I bought from Borders for directions. Then we came home and here I am.  Tomorrow I have to drive everyone around because Dad'll be at work and I need the car. I have to drop my mom off at work @ 9:00, then my brothers and I have to go to the HS @ 10:00 for a marching band run-through of music, then I have to take my brother to golf @ 1:00, and pick my mom up @ 2:00. This is all because I don't have a car. If I did, it would be much easier. I try to tell my parents this, but they just don't see it. Oh well. I got my report card today...I got all A's for the last six weeks and got A's on all my exams except....Advanced Math. I have no idea how!! I mean, I thought math was my best subject...oh well. But I still have my 4.0! Wooooo...  Well that is all for now, I'm out. *3 days until my birthday*  BTW, sorry if there are any spelling or grammatical errors in here, I don't feel like proof reading this whole thing.
