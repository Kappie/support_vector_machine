Why don't I have any tech-loving friends?  I'm staying with my mother this weekend in rural West Virginia. The DSL is speedy but try to find a Sunday New York Times. I phoned the closest/only Wal-mart, about 25 minutes away, to inquire as to whether they carried the Times.  I knew it was a risky gamble.  The lady on the phone said she'd flip through the local Sunday paper, the Charleston Gazette, to see if she could find the "New York Times section" inside. I politely thanked her and told her not to waste her time. Sadly, I'm not kidding.  I'm addicted to the Sunday New York Times in print. And books in print. I get almost all my news and info electronically, but I wonder if I will ever make the switch to ebooks.
