It became popular for some really odd reason. Everyone wants me to get one. I'm always sooo bad at keeping up with these things. I've hadfour now and every time, I've postedtwo times at the most? I never was good at keeping regular (on paper) diaries either. I'm going to try though. Not just because I'm being encouraged to, but because I think it would be anice thing to keep. I don't guarentee anything. I'm certainly not a writer, sodon't expect wonderfully written stories about my life.You won't get that.Ohyeah. My name is Kaitlyn... andI'm a junior in high school. I have a few friends. I'll tell you more about them later. And more about me. I have stuff to do!
