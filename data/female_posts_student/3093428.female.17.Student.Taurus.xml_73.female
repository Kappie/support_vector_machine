While eating diner at my granny's, my dad calls and says "You want to go train exploring?". Whoa, a question I haven't been asked for so long. Why? Well, maybe due to the absence of Fred, me spending more time with my friends, or because of my Step mom. As I recall, the last time I went train exploring it was with my step mom. It really sucked. You can Never NEVER bring someone who isn't as into trains as you. The time before was almost a year ago, without Charlene. Once again, she was not in the city. It was time to take advantage of the situation.  "Sure! Lets do it!" I said and we went into Richmond to explore tracks I always wanted to explore. It was my favorite childhood trains other line that we went on, and all these times I've never really seen these tracks from the rails point of view. We started on No 2 road, out by the bridge over to Steveston, and I had Susan (my camera)with me ready to take interesting shots of the old line. It was really really weird. I never knew any of these things were hear. But what broke my heart was how businesses have treated the railroad. We found 12 customers the railroad serviced, or used to. Out of those 12, only one received railroad cars. ONE! 1!!! It was so surprising to see that. It's so interesting how people really dislike the business of the railroad. Broke my heart.  On a closing note, as we made are way back to the car, and came close to the end of the line, I saw a 'W' sign. This sign obviously stands for Whistle. But there was no need to whistle, there was no road it was crossing. Ahhhh, but many years ago, the railway did cross the road, and went into Steveston. MANY years ago. And now all that stands in remembrance of the history of the old line to Steveston is a whistle sign. How sad. We Don't Want You Anymore trains, and once your gone, no one will remember you. That's probably true, and sad for a railroader like me...
