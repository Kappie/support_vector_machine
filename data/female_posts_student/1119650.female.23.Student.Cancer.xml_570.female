It started Friday night with a yummy dinner at  urlLink Boxcar Cantina  and then we all headed over to the Apartment where we watched Wargames (OMG!  Bill, there is a Pterodactyl in ths movie!!!).  Matthew Broderick got really hot between WarGames and Ferris Bueller.  Thank God for some things, I suppose.  I wasn't really in the mood to drink and a shot of Black Haus didn't really help the cause.  I called it kind of an early night and hit the hay.  Saturday was nice to sleep in without waking up feeling sick.  Ru and I went to lunch at Applebees and then to Chez Target.  I managed to get out of the store a) only spending $25 and b) not purchasing anything for myself.  It was a miracle if I do say so.  If you ever wanna buy funny birthday cards Target is defintiley the place to do that.  I finally picked up my board from Princeton and its nice and sharp and waxy and tuned so that was exciting.  I have been running ideas thru my head as to how I want to have the top of the deck painted b/c I'm too cheap to buy a new ride so I'm gonna just continue to use this one.  I ran home for dinner and some hella yummy cake for my grampy's birthday (he's so smooshy and spry for someone who's 77).  Later that night we got everyone together and watched the NHL AllStar Game Skills Competition which was very entertaining.  (Is it just me or is  urlLink Martin St.Louis  freakin' beautiful?!?!)  Bex got slaughtered in Madden (106 to 14 at the half?!?!), went out to  urlLink Turtle  for some drinking (well, a lot  of drinking) and some drama.  I came face to face with PeterPan.  She didn't stab my eyeballs out, but we've agreed that we don't like each other, have said it to one another and we are going to be civil in public because we have many mutual friends.  I can't wait for April when she'll finally have moved away.  Anyhow, there was more drama because Ashley showed up and that was a little ridiculous, but I finally got to drink with the lovely and always insane Twan, gave some lapdances to Bex, yelled at Tim to stop talking to my mom and though I may have gotten the beer tears a lil, I didn't yak, so woo for me for holding my booze!  To bed at 5 a.m., not a bad nite.    Sunday morning: not pretty.  Not dehydrated, but REALLY bad headache.  Me, Ru, Bex and Tim went to the Greenwich Diner where we saw the evil greaseface from high school with her other nasty friend.  They ended up asking Bex 'who  are  you (as we'd seen them out last weekend) and she goes "you ex boyfriend's new girlfreind" (though she's not).  It was mad funny, she's a champ, that girl.  After that we went to KayBee Toys and contemplated buying a McFlurry machine and a witch's hat.  We used our better judgement and passed on both though.  We watched the actual all star game on sunday afternoon which was exciting.  I ate some dinner and then Bex and I headed out to the boy's game.  They were winning 4 to 3 with 20 seconds left in the game (thanks to 2 goals by Tim and some awesome saves by Ru) and then the other team tied it up.  Bex and I were unsure as to what would come next.  Would they leave it as a draw because it wasn't playoffs yet?  No, that wouldn't be nervewracking enough for me and Becki.  Instead it was  a frickin' shootout .  This is  VERY  stressful to watch when your there cheering people on!  Ru made 4 good saves and they finally got one in on him, but then it was Tim's turn to answer with his shot and he scored too (for a hat-trick I might add!).  Ru made another great save and the next guy up on the Rink Rats (the boy's team) made it in.  They won 6-5.  Wooo!  Bex and I went on a mission for cheeseballs and orange cupcakes which brought us all across P.C. with no luck.  We finally settled on a snackmix and some twinkees and BK for us.  Back to the Apt. for the end of the ProBowl and some more Madden and before I knew it it was 1 a.m. and I headed home.  All in all, pretty awesome weekend, just wish I had more time to sleep.
