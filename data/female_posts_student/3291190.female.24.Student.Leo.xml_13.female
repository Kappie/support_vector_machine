Evan invited me to eat dinner with his parrents tomorrow night, which made me feel a little excited and scared.  At one point, after discovering that I have no $$$ he offered to give me money for gas. Its a horrible thing but secretly deep down inside I do enjoy it when someone cares enough to go out of their way to take care of me.  We then proceeded to have an awesome night with many unplanned occurances and a couple firsts for me. It seems as though the moments alone with Evan are really starting to get to me. Its the simplest thing like explaining my day to him, or just sitting beside him  reading while he watches TV. Something strange fills those moments that creates an attachement or a bond. Those quiet moments spent side by side, day after day, lead me to the same place,  the same feeling of comfort.Its strange  scary but I really do care for this boy. So when I fall, its going to be flat on my face, feeling sick, depressed, the whole 9yards...but for now I am soaring up in the air. See you when I come back down
