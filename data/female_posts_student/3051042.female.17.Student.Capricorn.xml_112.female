Okay, okay... I'm writing now. Sum up of the weekend...  Friday: Seniors last day. Explained in past entries. Pissed at Nick for something, I don't remember.   Saturday: Pinball Pete's. Michelle. DDR. Pool. Driving Game. Starbucks. Left. Job hunting. Michelle = home.  Sunday: Electronic Music Fest. Michelle. Sleep. Feel up Seth, who I think is Josh.  Monday: Wake up. Realize Josh is actually Seth, or Seth is actually Josh, or something. (?) Hang out with April and Nick at the park. Take them to the wave field. More Pinball Pete's. Talked with Mike. Delivered car to April at Mike's. Install key pad on car door. Eventually get drunk as fuck after learning that Josh is still fucking Reanda. I'm feeling used. Polish off the Tequila Rose. Have a couple beers. Have school in the morning. Josh shows up (not with Reanda, as originally planned). I'm happier. We talk. Shit hits the fan. I go to bed. He talks with me on AIM. I finally get to bed. I'm not sober... at all.  Tuesday: Wake up late for school. Drive Mike to class. Get Starbucks. Get to school. 3rd hour sucks balls. Leave with Michelle for Starbucks (yet again). See Mike's dad. Talk = guys. Get back to school. English sucks. Post up VOTE FOR DAVID posters around school for senior cabinet. I hope he wins. After school. Go shopping with Michelle. Have a bottle of wine and a movie afterward. Get stoned. Go home late. Oh well.  Today: Late to school once again. Get Starbucks. See Mike's dad, again. Make it to 3rd hour. Meet up with Michelle in the lower lot. We get a shitload of work done in Kellman's class. Get Gareth and head back to Starbucks. I'm broke. They get iced coffee for me. Write more to the movie script. Get back to class. 5th hour sucks. I hate movies. Instead I sketch. Forensics fucking sucks too... thanks to the bastards that don't do their work. Tiki's monologue was awesome. Michelle's (Evanoff) was good too. Get out of school. Go to work. Work blows. Drive Sue's daughter to pick up Sue's Daughter's Daughter from school. I get back to work and clock out after running credit cards. Head to Michelle's (Colon) house after work. Watch dumb Anne of the Thousand Days movie. David, Michelle, and I have a nice little conversation about sex and drugs. I have to leave to make the curfew that my mom put in place. Drive home. Mom's not home. I'm pissed.   And now I'm here.  Tomorrow, Michelle and I are leaving for 3rd hour. I should probably go to all my classes but I don't know anymore. I'll probably give into her, but I really need to stay on track with my homework and shit. Tomorrow isn't going to be that great, but I do need to figure out what all of my grades are looking like for the end of the year. I  NEED  to make honor roll or I'm so completely screwed. I've got dinner with the family too. Then Michelle and I go and work out.  G'night all... or whoever still read this.
