Turns out we came a little too early so me and creampuff went to sev to goget a big ass slurpee in which i finished alot of it. Yay! it was quite fun since we were quite hyper.. not that it shud come as a surprise. Well 2 more classes to go. My shirt plunges quite low.. ppl think im not wearing a bra when i am. ch.. im nto THAT much of a slut. But then again. .who knows?
