I love my other roommate just as much, but she's too busy spreading SARS and getting jocked. not only is Ms. C-town beautiful, she can also whip up a six course meal AND fix toilets. watching her work my potty today was amazing. after three weeks of having severe drainage issues, due to mineral deposits, i am now one happy camper. when i tell ppl that i went abroad on my own, they are impressed by my independence and survival skills. honestly, i have none. i'm just a lucky dame who always had someone there to help me out when i needed it. anyway, i am truly honored to be living with a real-life Wonder Woman.   i think my earlier blog needs some serious clarification. please note that i said i'd be abstaining from super good-looking ppl. regular good-looking is no problem, i have my children to think about after all. therefore, it was definitely not a cattle call for ugly ppl. sorry.
