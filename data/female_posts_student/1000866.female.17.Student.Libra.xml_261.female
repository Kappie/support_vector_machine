I spent it with Chris and Matthew, and yeah I'm going to have to stay up all night to get everything done, but it was worth it to have such a good day with them. We just hung out and stuff. I'm going to miss both of them, but it's only a week, so...yeah. I'm really excited though. I can't wait to get there tomorrow afternoon. Woo Hoo. I really do need to go majorly do some laundry, and pack. yikes. I've only got like....twelve hours til I leave.
