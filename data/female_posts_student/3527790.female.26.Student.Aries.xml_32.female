See I like to play so hard on my weekends that I actually use my week as rest for the upcoming weekend! hehe  I think the highlight of my weekend was the Rick Hansen Roll for Hope event. OKAY so it wasn't I race, but I raced it and for the first time in my life I crossed the finish line first. So that was very exciting!!  following that 10km bike ride I then did a training bike ride of 30km My Triathlon is coming up soon and I need to whip my bottom into shape if I am going to beat my previous time! Weight training today and maybe a short run...see how my knee holds up.  I think my favorite bit was my volunteer work. I'm helping with a therapeutic riding group and I have so much fun. The little guy that I am working with is really starting to respond well to me! I love that. He is getting better and better on the back of the horse. We even had him posting in rhythm ...Okay so it was only for 10sec at a time, but... He is getting much more confident on the back of a horse!!! Hopefully soon we'll get him to post with reins in his hands!!! Anyways I need to get to work! ahhh too much to do!
