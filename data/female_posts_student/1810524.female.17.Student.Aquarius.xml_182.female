You Fucking Bitch!!! Dont Just Run Away From Any Argument Which You Start, for your information you friends come say hi to me!! and the only one of your friends i even talk to katie, and thats like once every full moon, Just to lert you know the whole world doesnt revolve around you so does that mean anyone you know i cant talk to.....  Bye Vicky           hurtfull?! i thoguht so! i ran coz it hurt to stay...i argue coz it hurts to tlk and think about him atm. so i can just be left to cry over him once again. lol im normally ok at not reactin to emails n stuff...but that hurt soo soo much! i dont even understand why! but...yea if his aim with it was to hurt me he rly rly succeeded...   ive  kinda been bottlin things again. its not good. it builds up and i get stuck in vicky world! like goin off n just thinkin....but not really thinkin anything particular...everythings just kinda blurrey! i actually rly needed pete to hug me when im down but he's not here:( i hav got barnaby tho! *the huge amazinly great teddy i got him for his bday!* so i can hug him.  i thought i was gettin better- being happy..thinkin happy thoughts, but it seems that no matter what i do or how i feel my hatrid for me just gets bigger and bigger and stronger! in a sence its taken over! i would write about it..but for once im actually ashamed! although i dont think i should be ashamed because i cant stop myself cozwhen i do it, its like ive been tken over and it doesnt feel like me! i just have the scars.... i dont rly wanna tlk about it coz it....upsetting! and im feelin rly emotional again! the thoughts in my head hav got so bad i even thought of telin my parents and getting them to fix me....but i just cant bring myself to do it! if im ashamed then how will they feel?! they'll never understand! they read my suicie diary and were disgusted and ashamed. they didnt understand at all n apparently they were ry worried coz they thought i was suicidal *dahh* but what did they do?! mum tried to tlk to me once...but i clammed up...so she gave up! there is no way they'd ever ever understand me! they'd just think im pathetic! which i think...but i cant stop myself! i dont wanna do it! but when i go into these hatrid moods i cant not do it! i wouldnt have written all the stuff in my project if id never felt it..if i didnt feel it! people have read it n asked about it- like paula my photography teacher...but how can i tlk to her?! coz its not like i feel it all the time coz i can block it out when im in public!  tlkin to tom's helped...i wanna tlk more to him about it but i feel wierd! how do u bring up a delicate subject like that?! its just wierd. so therefore im just alone! i cant tlk so i bottle up...it builds up higher n higher. im all alone so i cant stop myself...im not strong enough on my own coz its gettin worse....and now we hav tears again! hmmm gonna go! not dealin well     Vx
