It's sweet how I know none of the people I'm going to see, so I'm not to stoked about this trip. I won't be home till Sunday, which means you don't have to listen to my annoying posts for another day or so. I talked to Jason on the phone last night, I love that boy so much. We're going to have a good time at Grange together, and hopefully go shoe shopping too! =) Hehe, thats right, shoe shopping, he's willing to unleash the wild shoe crave inside me, and thats what makes me love him, he's my super cute big bro. *wink wink. Hm, I wonder if Tara is going out downtown tonight, ugh, she probably will and she'll go see my super hottie babe-o-licious man. Not so kickass =( but I guess I'll live. I've decided that Mo Rocca is the cutest thing that ever happened to VH1 and I'll never get sick of "I love the "which ever decade they're raving about"". Last night on '91 they talked about Kurt Cobain, oh man, truly a legend. So an ode to Kurt is definitely necessary. Oh, and by the way, before I go, check out  urlLink www.smartpunk.com  it's sweet, got plenty of shit for peeps like me. Anyways, I'll leave ya'll alone. Holla atcha gurl.
