I'm the same as everyone else. I feel so special, so unique. I dunno, maybe there are actually some intersting blogs out there, but I've quickly discovered that  there are more people doing the mood: whatever mood is  thing then i would care to name. Ah well, nothing to do about it. I just feel like bitching about something. Yeah so, I'm going to have to add some pictures or something, and use the mood thing, and then I'll be like basically everyone else. Another attention craving teenager, with an outlet that no one really cares about. Cool, huh? Heh... doing the depressed teenager act is easy. I don't know, I'm thinking of just going back to writing in my journal, my penmanship needs some work. Also, people need to learn how to write poetry in at least some sort of form. And why does so many people's favourite color seem to be black? Yes, it goes with everything, but it's kind of depressing. Why the hell am I writing on this blog again? I did it already today. It's probably because I have not much else to do. Have church in the morning, hopefully it won't be hot, last time I almost got sick. I hate heat, and cold. Cold more then heat. Oh, and LOOK AT ME! I'M BEING ORGIONAL! that word is not spelled correctly. I don't feel like finding the right spelling though. Anyway, night.
