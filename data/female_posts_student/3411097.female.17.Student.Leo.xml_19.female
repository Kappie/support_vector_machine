SO MUCH careless.. shld have gotten a B but a C would be great liao.. Cant believe that i can actually score a C.. Remembering last year mid yr a F.. promo i got a 0 and CA another 0.. now i can actually jump to C was a really big jump le ba.. erm.. just now mr teo asked me infront of the whole class how i made the jump.. well.. i dunno how to ans.. but jus said it was cos of statistics i did quite okay.. but actually well.. i think it shld be said.. luck + work ba.. erm.. if ask if i have studied hard.. my ans is NO.. but if asked.. have i studied YES.. so that's what studied and didnt studied difference.. Now den i understand a concept... If i studied.. i can pass jus like anyone.. But actually after i pass my math.. i start to believe.. if i study i can do well.. there's nothing called impossible le...as for geo i havent get back.. but feel like its xiong duo ji shao le.. haiZzz.. but.. i shld be contented that at the very least...i tried to do my maths well.. geo if i really do badly.. i shld said.. its all because i really slack.. spend a day to study and expect to do well.. chinese A worst.. i studied yet i interpret Qn wrongly... But now am wondering.. Am i really find excuses for getting bad result?? Hahaha.. actually now den i understand something.. if u keep on finding excuses for bad result ultimately.. U wont do anything and then.. things jus keep on with excuses.. So i guess i shld learn something...BAD=YOUR OUR THINKINGS...  You noe what? i do maths jus because i wan to do it and i stop all those thinkings of bad result.. I guess after i do math i really fall for it.. Like Geography(which i like since sec 3) i learnt to love it.. Chinese was always my greatest love though my greatest fear... HAHAHA.. Things really change le ba.. Hopefully when i get back my result on mon.. i passed all... with flying colors thought chances are slim.. BUT everything started from chances isnt it? why give up a chance though its slim? Talking abt other things.. Suddenly feel very fortunate.. There's so much pple around me who cared abt me.. There's Huiping.. really wanna thx her a lot.. She really did alot to help me.. remembering that day when i thought i flunk my maths.. she give me her greatest encouragement.. Though she didnt said much actually.. BUT her existance does make so much diff.. She give me the courage to get on.. And oso.. Ceyi.. He's been there every now and then.. Though sometimes maybe disappointed.. But he really help..Buy food at nite for me, encouragement,... there's too much.. Guess.. life getting better.. hahhaa
