There was a stretch of time in the 90's that I didn't have my exam for six years. Yeah, that's right. Six. So, when I finally did go for a check-up, I found out that I had an ovarian cyst and that I had to have one of my ovaries removed. This was a major surgery that I probably could have avoided if I had caught it earlier. Anyway, ever since then I have had my exam every year. Listen, girls AND boys, it's very important! Get your annual exam!  Anyway,  I was totally dreading the pelvic exam. I can deal with the blood tests and the endless questions, but the pelvic exam is a nightmare for me. Shudder. I was laying on the exam table, feet in the stir-ups, and saying a little prayer that it was over when I felt this excruciating pain and the Doctor calmly asked, "Did that hurt?" Fuck. Did it ever! He had snuck in a rectal exam and stool sample. The worst part is that he referred me to a GI Specialist for a 'problem'. I'm assuming it's hemorrohoids but it could always be colon cancer and that is exactly where my brain goes to. Lucky me, I have two weeks to worry about my 'problem'.  But to the good news. I have refills for all of my prescriptions. I have asthma so I NEED them. And he was kind enough to give me a prescription for Phentermine.  I'm on my way to the phentermine.com forums to check out some success stories.....
