Even if I do, it won't change things. Tonight was great. It was a lasting memory that I will never forget. Morganna, Erika, and I had such great fun at Shoguns. The chinese guy was so funny. He could never remember Morganna's name. He kept talking to us and making jokes, but we didn't have a clue to what he was saying, so we all did what we do best, we laughed. Then he laughed at us because he didn't understand what was so funny. We didn't want the night to end, so Seth and Shane met us and we all went to my house and watched movies. First it was 'Pieces of April'. It was very artzy, but overall it was pretty good. Then onto the second movie, we couldn't agree. Seth, Shane, and Er watched Xandu or something like that. Me, goo, and my mom watched You Got Served. Whoever brought the twizzlers forgot them. I am eating them right now. They are my comfort food at this moment... Moments...they pass you by so quickly! What a difference a year and a half can make! Last August I didn't know it'd be like this. I didn't know that I would have to let go. I didn't even know I would have anything to let go of. How could I know that I could go from a freshman who had just came out of depression with absolutely no self-esteem, to an almost jr. who is finally happy with who she is? That's the thing I guess, you never know. You just have to take the chance and trust. Sometimes you get hurt, but sometimes you get lucky and you meet some awesome people like Morganna, Erika, and Keriann. I love you all and wish you best of luck in college. As someone once told me, "it's not the end m'dear, it's only the beginning ." *mmwah!*
