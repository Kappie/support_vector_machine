We dug one ourself which was very funny because we kept on going round in circles trying to decide which one to get.  Dad was also very generous and last night he bought me a ruler because I think James Green took mine.  :(  I am really quite bored as noone is online, so to give me something to do lets go back in the archives to a year ago.............Ok mayby not as it does not work, if anyone can get it 2 work please give me a bell.  I have just heard the rainbow song: Izzy we have 2 get a copy 4 u know what, and if you dont HELPPPPPPPP!!!!!  I have also just been told off for banging the door.  :( Toodles xx
