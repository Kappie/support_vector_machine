I was sitting at my window, watching the lightening, which by the way I took pictures of, which I hope turn out.  As I was watching the lightning I see part of our tree, that broke during a previous storm, come tumbling off.  Right on to my car!  I watched it and thought, "well that's not cool."  so this morning we assesed the damage, and I have three dents, a broken back window wiper, and a hole in my bumper.  But it could have been worse, Wonder Woman already scratched the front left side, with a trailer, so we're just going to get it all fixed at once.  And the best part is they're doing it while I'm gone this summer, so I don't have to be carless.      In other news HOSD has to be on tape tomorrow, and you know what?  We were still taping today.  Aaah!  I was at school until almost 5 editing today, and I have a feeling I may be tomorrow too.  The blood drive was today as well.  I, being a youth, was not able to donate, but I have a feeling even if I was old enough, my iron would have been too low to donate anyway.  Judging by my complexion though, you'd never know it.  *wink wink*  Paco, Mahinda, and Agemmemnon, all donated.  I was jealous.     So on friday, I'm going with Abner, Paco, and Agememnon to Great Spoons to see Troy, and we're going to their favorite mexican restaurant, and I'm scared, because I don't go well with spicy food.  Especialling since I've had indigestion for like a month porbably due to stress, because it started about when my hair started falling out.  Going off on a tangent, I read and article on MSN a few days ago, that said extended periods of high stress can take 10-15 years off of your life.  I found that quite frightening.  Back to the topic at hand, Wonder Woman said she went to the Mexican restaurant and ordered a quesadilla with just cheese, and they put so much chili powder on it she couldn't eat it.  Oh well, I'll get by.  But i'm heading away.  Probably not to bed.  Have a wonderful evening.
