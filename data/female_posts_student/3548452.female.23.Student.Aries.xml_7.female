It holds a lot of truths, a lot of secrets, a lot of things I just plain feel ashamed of- so you might want to read it all. This kinda has to go back a long ways, 'cause the reason I am the way I am is because of things that happened long ago. Like me getting literally run over by a car when I was 8 or 9... My legs were touching my back because of the way I got ran over and I probably should be in a wheelchair right now, but I'm not. I know it's all in my mind, but I'm deathly afraid of cars and that's why. I dont drive nor will I ever. Walking most places around here is good excercise and it never hurt anybody. If you think I'm stupid or crazy for not wanting to drive, tell it to those people who died last year in car accidents... oh that's right, they're dead, you cant :| It kind of sucks that my parents really worked a number on me when I was younger. I was taught to believe that they didnt care about me and that they didnt want me around... My mom pretty much told my dad to take me 'cause she didnt want me. My little brother was primarily my responsibility from the time I was 12 until I turned 18. I was molested, but for some reason, I didnt know anything about not letting people touch my "privates" so I didnt know it was wrong and nothing was ever done about it. Maybe that's why I'm going to say what I'm about to say, but it's the truth nevertheless. I like girls. Not all the time, and not every girl. That's kinda tacky. I'm tired of lying or keeping it hidden from everybody. If you didnt already know, I never liked you that way. If you did know, I wont come onto you so dont worry. I dont come onto girls anyway... Its a very particular girl that I like and it's very rare that I want to date one. Karri Cessna was my girlfriend, not my roommate and we only slept in seperate rooms because I wasnt quite comfortable with liking girls... I guess my religious background is why but I like em and I cant stop myself. If that causes problems for you, too bad. I cant change who I am I can only suppress it and I'm sick of trying to please you people. If I'm going to go to hell then so be it. That's between me and God. I'm sick of pretending that I'm so happy all the time. The truth is? I'm almost never happy and more than that? I'm suffering from depression but I will never go on medication. No need. I used to be suicidal when I was 12-13... then I met Shimron and all of that changed. He was initially my best friend... went through everything with me. Up until I met him I just kept everything to myself and so did he. Both middle children with lots of responsibility and anger we were just that couple. We only actually dated for a few months but we were off and on all thru highschool. The first time we broke up he made me promise not to do "anything stupid" and I will always keep that promise to him, no matter what's going on. So there's not ever a chance that I will kill myself. I may talk about it but it'll never happen. I have to live with my depression because it reminds me how far I've come. I did try to kill myself once when I was 12- right in my mother's face and she laughed at me. It kinda looses it's sting after that. The last time we broke up, in lieu of just saying "its not going to work out" he had his roomie pretend that he didnt know who I was (even though he paged me and that's why I was calling) and ask me if I was all these different girls. Then he gave me the old heave-ho. I was in love with that boy... and I havent been in love since. Anybody who thinks they can make me fall in love with them would be wrong. My heart hurts so much it's like a physical pain because of him. I will never let myself stop loving him because I never want to forget how much it hurts to get dumped that way. I havent been dumped quite the same way since. Nobody has really mattered that much since. I may love you, but I'll never be in love with you. I'm to paranoid to let myself go that much and by the time I decide to consider it, you let me know you're not worth it. I compare every guy to him because for all intents and purposes of a relationship, he's wonderful, attentive, loving, caring, and he still cares about me. He still loves me too- which is why he thinks he doesnt know what love is, but that's okay. He can think what he wants to... I know the truth. I'm not a good girl either. I'm not going to lie anymore and tell you that I'm so perfect and I dont do anything wrong. I've stole, borrowed and havent returned, and I definitely am not going to pretend that I've never done drugs... that I havent overindulged more than once and that I still do mess with them on occaision- tho the occaision is becoming very far and inbetween, so let's not dwell on that. I wonder why it is that guys think that an insult would be considered a compliment in the eyes of a fat girl? I dont think they're compliments. Just because I'm not the cutest girl in the world, and I'm fat, doesnt mean that I'm just going to be your slave and let you run all over me. Maybe some stupid girls you know do that, but I'm quite intelligent, I'm told everyday how much I mean to some and they happen to be cuter than any guy that's tried to give me those stupid lines and put me down. I dont like liars either, like the guy who told me he was going to school at Wayne State yet never seems to have any books at his house and still hasnt returned to school. Yeah... that was really cute. Why lie about something that is so easy to confirm it borders on stupid? That'd be like me wearing a blue shirt and telling you it was red. Doesnt make sense does it? I always have books at my house... I dont know about any OTHER college students, but if you study at home or at school- you still tend to keep your books with you. I heard an old Hootie and the Blowfish song last night and it almost made me cry. Shimron sang that song to me once. I guess that's why I'm a sucker for guys that sing to me, but they take it way too far. I already know what it feels like to get my heart broken and it's not an experience I wish to repeat. Just how much does it hurt? It has taken me this long to make myself just numb to the hurt I've already endured. Everytime someone hurts my feelings, I feel like I'm a glutton for punishment 'cause I never can cut them loose. People take that for granted I'm sure because let me tell you, I'm sick of these people just thinking that it's okay to hurt me over and over and thinking that just 'cause they give me a little sob story I'll forgive and things will be the same. Not anymore they wont. I hurt so much that I cannot breathe, I hurt so much that I cannot be sane, normal, or happy, until I find someone. Everytime I see new babies I wanna cry because I will never have one, but it's okay. I'll adopt some and get to give some kids a life like I never had. Sometimes it hurts me to watch my best friend with her family and her kids because my family was never like that and while I really love them all, sometimes the pain is just too much to take. Maybe I'm just not allowed to be happy, I dont know, but you guys dont help. So if you're out there thinking that your sweet nothings are going to get you laid, save it for another day 'cause right now, I'm not in the mood. I think I've had enough dick to last me a lifetime and I really dont think that I'm too far behind some of you guys... I wont give you an exact number, but it's more than I can count on fingers and toes and no I dont feel like a ho. And yes, that's including women- (and yes, I've slept with more than one) and I cant help it if I have a more-than-natural sexual appetite. Espeicially for a woman I hear. I'm always careful, I have no diseases and never have- so I consider myself lucky. For all of you who this is shocking right now, I hope you're happy that your perfect friend is far from perfect. I"m giving up this pretense of being "the good girl" from now on. I get my religion in a bottle now and that's the way it's gonna be. I have no problem with bein the alcoholic that I am and fuck what you're talking about. I cant do drugs 'cause they arent legal, but I can drink myself into a stupor an it's a-okay. Oh yeah- and F.Y.I. I dont go behind skanks so if I see you talkin to one, I will assume you're fuckin her and I will not fuck you. Laters folks :D Love ya all. This is me
