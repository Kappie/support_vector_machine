Yeah but I'm a bit slow with names anyway, it takes me about three days and a whole load of sticky notes to actually process who someone is. Why do we need to remember names anyway, thingy will do won't it?! Umm... yes... I do have things to do I guess. Oh fine, I'll crawl away untill I can actually think of something!
