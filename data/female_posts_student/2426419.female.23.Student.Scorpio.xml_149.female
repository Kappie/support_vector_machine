Okay, let me tell you that I was THIS CLOSE to being seriously ticked off when Rachel said "I can't do this right now. I'm so sorry," and got on the plane. I mean, you could see the steam beginning to rise inside my brain. But then . . . bliss. With all this true love floating around (What Dreams May Come, the final episode of Friends), I am so happy too. *dances and twirls with Jaci* Where's my Ross and whatever-Robin-Williams'-character-was? Nah, who needs real relationships? Because . . . . . ROSS AND RACHEL ARE TOGETHER FOREVER!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY. I haven't completely lost faith in American sit-coms. Dawson's Creek made me doubt, but Friends restored my faith. We like and want the obvious. So give it here. Thank you. *sings, "Ross and Rachel, Ross and Rachel . . . ."*
