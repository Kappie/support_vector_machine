I picked up Steph at around 6, but not before the semi-awkward photo-session with her parents.  I'm pretty used to it, though, and I've even come to like it.  We met up with Anand and Jen and then we were off to Horton Plaza in our "limo" (Lincoln Navigators are totally in, by the way).  On the way there, we watched Monster's Inc., which was perfect, and Anand and Jen used their super brains to get the sound working.  Anand picked a great restaurant for us, the Nappa Valley Grille, and it was really very perfect.  It was cool to walk around Horton Plaza in our formal clothing while everyone admired Steph and Jen.  The food was great and we made our way to the prom.  It was so great to see everyone all dressed-up.  We have quite an attractive school, I must say.  I loved the dancing, too.  After a few hours of that, we headed back to Carmel Valley, and I dropped Steph off at home and went to a surprisingly wonderful beach bonfire.  I got to roast marshmallows.  I haven't done that in a really long time.  Nico, Max, Paul, Florence, Laura, Emily... there were more, but I didn't know everyone's name.  They were all incredibly nice, and it really made me feel good.  I just roasted marshmallows and felt like a little kid again, back when we used to go camping with my cousins all the time.  When Simon and Garfunkel's "America" came on, I was in heaven.  So now I'm home, checking out some of the photos, and writing all this down in the hopes that if I'm down in the coming days (I'm not planning on it, but it could happen), I can look back on this and appreciate it.  Heather and Insha: We are going to kick Prom 2005's ass, and have an amazing time together.  I love you both so much.  G'night.
