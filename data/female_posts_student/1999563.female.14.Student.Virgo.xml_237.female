I don't know why. It was just one of those days when I felt ugly. I can't hide behind my mask anymore.  I seemed to have been hiding behind it for too long. Everyone thinks I am this happy person with a perfect life.  Its time to face the facts.   I'm not.   First of all-  I am not happy.  I know I really should be, I have been gifted with many wonderful things.  But i'm not.   Even my voice teacher noticed my mask being missed.  He was like "Are you doing okay? Are you having a bad day?"  Every day is a bad day in this living hell.  I wish I had someone I could really talk to.  Someone at school who would know my true feelings.  Someone I wouldn't be afraid to tell everything.  I wish there was someone at church.  Someone who really liked me.   When I go to church I just feel like everyones fake. They try to plaster a smile on and pretend they are happy to see me and ask me how I am. "Good!" I quickly reply with my fake grin.  But I am not good.  Today was a crying day.  I feel like I don't fit in, anywhere.  I am to ugly.  To boring.  Not smart enough.  I don't have the right clothes.  Even my hair always looks dumb.   But if I could, if I only would focus on God more all those things would just fade away because they really- and truly,  DON'T MATTER!
