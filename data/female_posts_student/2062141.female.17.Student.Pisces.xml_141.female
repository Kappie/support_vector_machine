Well in all fairness, the end of March. Which means... SHIT three more months. I can't take it. Well, by June no one's doing any schoolwork so I guess I can whittle that down to like a little more than 2 months of academic hell. Weekends are beginning to seem euphoriatic. Every Friday, I just drop everything and forget that I would ever enter the Hazen doors again. But that's what I want to do. Sweet release. I just don't do any homework. Like I ever do. I have some to do now. I really should do it. Cause then I won't be doing it at night and I can actually talk on the phone or watch tv or sleep. Oh.. yeah I'm gonna fail Chemistry again. I just failed the test today. Butt. I hate Chemistry I hate it I hate it. I don't need to know it. It's the sorriest excuse for a subject ever... >;@. I'll deal with that later. ( Today was the weirdest day. It around noon it was like 65 (felt almost 70) and all happy and warm, (why do i know this? we were all outside because some gangsta pulled the fire alarm), then, after school I walk outside to the parking lot and it's pouring rain! Not cool! It was ...WARM.. before. Oh well... now I'm all cozy in my pjs listening to New York State of Mind and contemplating watching a movie. Or possibly... doing homework. Oh yeah, Nick was back at school today too. Yay he's betta. It's a brand new day. I have a wedgie.  "Tonight, Not Again"  The night. She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.  This time like every other time I believe that I never find Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again.  And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lalalalovely.  Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points As I'm all by myself tonight not again not again√â  And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lalalalovely.  Well if you should nervously break down When its time for the shakedown would you take it It's when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle that you've made it And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice.  Lovely. Lalalalovely.  Say it again. Lovely. So lovely. to do it again Again. Loving again. It's coming again.... Lalalalovely.  -Jason Mraz  Rainy days and content put me in the mood for this song
