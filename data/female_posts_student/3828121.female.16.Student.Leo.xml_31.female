Too much too take I can’t bend anymore, I know I’m sure to break. But do you care? Does it bother you? You wouldn’t dare tell me no, or could you? And I know that you’re not thinking of me, but that’s ok, I think about you always and you have me smitten, and I’ll fall hard, I hit the ground, I’ll break my heart, but it’s all for you, so it’s alright. Another night of endless worry, I’m so sorry I haven’t been so happy lately. You make me happy, but you haven’t been around. The sound of my crying is all that fills the air this time of night. And the clicking of the keyboard as I write. I write for you. Will you even glance at this? Will it even make a difference? Will it help my situation? There’s a tiny complication with the way I feel for you. You’re tainted it all, and I’m still trying to believe you when you say that you’re sorry.  Polluted heart and littered wrists; defines me to a tee. Between the sobbing and the typing, I’ve made a mournful melody. But it’s beautiful. Kind of like you, only twice as sad if that’s possible. And I want you to be in love with me. I bleed for you, will you bleed for me? I take this too far every time, but I don’t know what else to do. And I’m so confused, you leave me totally powerless, and to be quite honest I don’t like it much. I feel like such a dummy, a fool. I should of left you be, kept you far away from me, but you’re so alluring. And now I’m consuming all this sadness. It’s become so habitual. I want you to be dreaming of me. ‘Cause I know that I’ll be dreaming of you, I always do. I’ve misconstrued this whole entire thing. I’m struggling and fighting back my tears. Ignoring the words I know I true. I’ve gained nothing when it comes to you….       boo-yah biotch.....ok, sorry, i just read that the way it's supposed t be read, and it rolled off my tongue so perfectly, i had to say that. ok, anywaz... i guess ima go now. ooo...i making a new art project. it should be awesome when i'm done. the epitome of teenage love. bwahahaha....i am an artist. bow down to me....yea right! ha! but anyways my loves, ima go. *muah* (since i have no one else to say it too *sad little pony*)
