Also some very derivative moments, particularly the golf course chase.  Don't know how well the parody plays for all you whippersnappers [g] too young to remember the 70s.  Star Wars II :  Didn't suck like SW1, not as good as the original.  Still, quite watchable.  Nice to see Yoda kick some ass, believable or not.  Lilo and Stitch :  VERY well done.  Nice character development, lots of real humor (as opposed to the Disney kind).  I knew right from the beginning, when Lilo punched out her classmate, that this would not be your typical Disney cartoon.  Aliens were excellent, too.  Scooby Doo :  Good job emulating the animated characters, especially Shaggy.  Treatment of Scrappy Doo was a riot.  Velma was very likeable.  Highlight: a fart contest scene worthy of  "Blazing Saddles".  Shaggy pot references were subtle, but definite.
