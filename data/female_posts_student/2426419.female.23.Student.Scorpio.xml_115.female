I'm so excited, and I know it will move me so much that I'll want to forsake grad school, start up voice lessions again, and move to New York. Watching a live musical always does things like that to me. It's musicalerific. (glances at Jaci, the linguistic diva, for approval of her new word). Okay, I will work on it.  anyway, i guess that's all i have to say. no great rants of minimalistic pseudo-wisdom. i should do something constructive like take a shower and think about what i'm going to wear for tonight.  Jaci, have fun playing with your itty bitty cousin tonight!
