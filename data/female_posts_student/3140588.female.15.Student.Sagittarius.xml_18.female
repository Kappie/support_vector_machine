God, i just wish all of this could go back to normal. that everyone could decide what they want to happen, and everyone could get their way. but that's impossible, because everyone wants completely different things. and i pray to God that no one leaves. i was seriously thinking about flying myself down to south carolina just to get away from all of this mess, but my mom told me that running away doesn't solve anything, because your problems will still be here when you get back. no matter how long you stay away. so i pray to God that everyone stays here. because we all need eachother more than ever right now. even if some people have really hard feelings for others right now, we need to stick together through this. no matter what tries to stand in our way. i really beg and wish of everyone that we can put the past behind us. because i've finally learned that i can't love and live in the past anymore. because it's not doing me any good at all. i love the one who used to come into my room almost every day with a huge smile on his face, always looking to make me smile and laugh. i love the one who called himself cookie monster and spazzed out about every little thing. i love the one who used to help me clean the dishes and ended up spraying me with the sink hose. i love the one who made fun of me for the hip thing. i love the one who was always by my side. i love the one who held me when i was crying, and the one who whiped my tears away. i love the one who i could stay with in complete silence and feel whole. i love the one who made me feel like an angel. that's the one i love. i don't love the pain and the hurtful words that come from him now. i'm always wondering where all the love from all of those poems and all of the love in his eyes went. because everything just seems cold now. and i wish someone would turn on the god damned heater. sure, i miss the past. but that doesn't mean i need it back. it doesn't mean i'm going to spend the rest of my life chasing after it. because i'm not. we all need to move on with our lives. together. as friends. and i hope it all works out. for the majority of people reading this, you will have no idea what i'm talking about. well you know what, don't ask me, because you're not supposed to know.
