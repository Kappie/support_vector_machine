So, Harry Potter from work went to the Beerfest on Saturday, only to join countless others for expensive half pints and endless portapotty lines. (He's not from O-town.) When Potter was second in line (after a good thirty minute wait) for the next available green box of a toilet, a mad (picture big fat obnoxious) guy comes lightning speed running out of nowhere (definitely not the line), dives into the next available potty, and locks it. 4 big angry (full-blattered) men from the line proceed to the potty with Big Obnoxious inside and begin to voice there anger with the situation by simply tipping over the potty with B.O. inside. No reaction. They return to the line. With fear, Potter proceeds to the next toilet (right beside B.O.), does his business with one foot perma- ready to bolt out the door, should things take a turn for the worst. When Potter exits, B.O. has still not budged from the now horizontal, and surely shaken-like-a-polaroid-pictured potty. Is B.O. dead? In shock? Crying for his mother? Or just crying (as Potter suggested he would be doing is such a sitch)? No one can say for sure...the lack of a non-intoxicated account of the business leaves things quite unfinished. Rumors spurned later on say police with an ambulance close at hand had to pry his embarrassed fat bastard body from the box and ship to the hospital due to non-physical damages.
