       
      Someone in the apartment across the way is listening to Stairway to Heaven. I've probably heard it three times already in the past two days, and something enchants me about it: here I am, I don't know a single Led Zeppelin song except for that one and it plays over and over again. I'm tempted to listen to it too on my computer.  Oh, the CTY memories...
