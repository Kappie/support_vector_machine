And I will try to pursuade my parents to go to the IT Show 2004 at Suntec to buy at least a digital camera. I am eyeing the Panasonic DMC-FX1 or an Olympus. But price- wise, Olympus is only $399+ while the panasonic is $649 (=~=). But Panasonic features more like the famous Macro function and many white balance settings. Olympus has more megapixels and 'Super Macro'... But first, my quiz....     i n f o r m a t i o n  1. name: Akiko, the one who always hates everything in the world. 2. single or taken: Single. Hm, I don't like the word 'taken', sounds so low. Like those that are 'untaken' are the unlucky ones. I tell you, no. We are not! I am happy as a single even if it means I will be a single forever. 3. sex: Female. I have a very pure mind and concept. Don't lead me into the wrong path. 4. siblings: 1  5. hair color: Lightish brown. Ya, I did mentioned before I like a coffee downpour girl.  6. eye color: Brown. Dull color. 7. shoe size: A petite 5, or is it a 6?   8. height: 160cm. And will never grow up again.  r e l a t i o n s h i p s  1. who are your best friends?: My sec school friends. What about my pri. school? I was too miserable to remember. 2. do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?: No. That's kinda sad, right?   f a s h i o n s t u f f  1. where is your favorite place to shop: The nearer to my home, the better. Ya, I hate to travel far. Or places I am firmiliar with. Ya, I hate to lost my way.    2. any tattoos or piercings: Tattoos, nah. Piercings? My ear lobes. That's it.  s p e c i f i c s  1. do you do drugs?: No. I am not sick. Stop cursing me. 2. what kind of shampoo do you use?: Dove. I am going to swtich to the Pantene's 'Lose Hair Control' or something like that. Coz my hair keeps falling. Ooops, there goes another strand of hair again.  3. what are you most scared of?: Nowadays, I will say I am scared of getting a sucky job that pays low and you must see other people's 'faces' every time... Man, I hate that! 5. who is the last person that called you?: One of my friends, she was anxious about her project or something like that. 6. where do you want to get married?: Somwhere that is simple, quick, good food, good music, good air conditioner. And no, it is not a church. Sounds like a restaurant... That will do.   7. how many buddies are online right now?: 6 right now. It's the low peak of the hour... 8. what would you change about yourself?: My physical looks foremost. Then, maybe my character or attitude. My father always says I have an attitude problem, ya, I have, especially to him.  f a v o r i t e s  1. colors: orange and white. But I hope my future room will be painted deep pink oround the four walls and then a thick line of orange across the room. Ceiling will be white. Coz it helps to 'expand' the room.  2. food: Noodles, noodles and Japanese food. 3. boys names: Oooo. I love this question. Lucas, first. Coz I love Lucas SD, regardless if it is 1st or 3rd edition. Second, Harry. I like this name for a long time. Because SM Lee's christian name is Harry. And of course, Harry Potter. Both characters are brave! Shiro is also a nice name. 4. girls names: Sylvie, also taken form a limited edition female SD. And boy, she is a beauty. And also Freya and Alda (something like that, I translated from the chinese words) from Chobits. 5. subjects in school: Arts. No specific favourite subjects. 6. animals: Dogs and hamsters and rabbits. I like those, their movement are so cute! 7. sports: swimming. I am lazy, so I did nothing much but just walking around...
