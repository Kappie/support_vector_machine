Yesterday I had to work for eight hours which wasn't too fun but, what can you do? I came home and I planned on going to sleep but then I started talking to some people. I talked to brett for over two hours. Crazy.   Today I'm working from 2 to 7 and that's really all I'm doing. I need to go to the police station, too to get statistics for my weighted essay writing final paper. Gah. No good. I'm really, really excited for summer. Sleeping in, being with my friends, Caseville!! Well, hopefully Caseville. I also am hoping to go downtown a lot. Maybe hang out at my brother's appartment while he's gone. I love downtown Chicago. It's like, the coolest place ever. I'm also thinking of maybe going to Six Flags once or twice. I want to get a season pass but I think you need four people to get one or something.   This summer should be fun. I think I'm going to be doing a lot of college searching though. I've definitely got it narrowed to a few schools downtown chicago. Probably UIC, DePaul, Loyola, or Northwestern. We shall see, we shall see. I'm already getting excited for college. Mostly, I guess, I'm excited to get away from my high school. I don't know. I guess people are ok but...there are a lot of really annoying people in my school. I've also decided to volunteer at MarianJoy this summer too. That should help me a lot with getting some hands-on experience for OT.   Alright, this is getting too long and I'm sick of typing. I woke up pretty early this morning and didn't go to bed until like, 1:00, thanks to someone. Hah.
