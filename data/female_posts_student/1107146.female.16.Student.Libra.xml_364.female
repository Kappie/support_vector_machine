When making such boisterous claims about taking the car, I should have thought that she works the last two days of the week in the office. Umm....argh. And now I see that you've called about a zillion times...where was I? But anyway, seeing as how it's pretty much three seconds before you have to go, this really sucks, and I'm really sorry that I had to bail at the last minute.
