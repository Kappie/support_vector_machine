I’ve brought the discussion around to how the older people feel insecure about their future as their children are becoming Han Chinese, and they are not sure whether they will come home and care for their parents how they would like to be – they may have to move away into apartments and cities.  This is caused by a Chinese education, which is funded by tourism dollars that the Tibetan families have earned over the years.  So I didn’t have to make it up.
