Did beach lifeguard training yesterday, swam a time of 7.09 min, and managed to do all other tasks required. The guys were nice to me. B has gotten well cute, and L2, mmm seems nice.   Today at work i was being wound up. Usually the supervisors jokily twist my words into something sexual, but it's not at all intimidating. But today it was really bad. The sexual references were much more direct. Starting with "do you want me to spank your arse?" leading to "come sit on my lap and give me a hug" and "have you ever considered working at hooters". This doesnt bother me that much, but isnt there a law about this, that boses can't actually make sexual references etc? And when 2/3 guys all direct sexual comments at me, then it gets a bit hard, Only having one boss taking the mick is ok, but i felt really uncomftarble with 3 of them doing it. I'm not leading them on or anything. All of them are engaged etc, and i'm not at all interested in D, Li, or the other bloke, but i dont think that ive led them on or anything.   This is a v.dificult situation, and it's getting worse. Any one have any ideas on how to solve this??
