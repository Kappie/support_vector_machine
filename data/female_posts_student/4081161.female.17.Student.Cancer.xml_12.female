If a certain person is around me, they start to get offended because they don't understand I'm saying it outloud for my benefit, not to insult them.       I'm sleepy = I don't make any sense.       If today is Monday, then yesterday was Sunday. Yesterday was the farewell party to our beloved Way family. But the highlight was riding a horse. (w00t w00t)      My mom and I arrived an hour early to help with the preparation. This party was a barbeque at the Coons Ranch which is a nice little ranch situated at the heart of In-The-Middle-Of-Nowhere-But-With-Lots-Of-Cows. My mom bought balloons which took forever to purchase. My mother has bad bouts of indecisiveness. But yeah, anyhow, I played the piano and read "The Complete Works of Shakespeare" while the other guests arrived. Even when the other guest arrived, I was still reading "As You Like It" pretending I was a large, human-sized pillow on the couch. Alas, I was found and I actually went outside to "socialise" with the other people. It was .... okay. There were a lot of other people from church milling around, drinking beer and whatever whatnot. I don't know. I wanted to drink beer but it's not a good influence on two of the pastor's children. But I really wanted it. I really wanted to drink beer. :(       After a while, Christine Coons came over and told me to tell her if I was ready to ride her horse, Isabelle. I was all "NARF!" Last time I rode a horse, I had a hurtin' on my butt, but for some odd reason I wished to repeat the experience. (I'm weird, I'll admit that.) I wolfed down my desert as much as possible and helped Christine lug the saddle to the horse on the otherside of the ranch.       Her horse is a Philly, and I have no idea what that means but that's what it is. She has a long Spanish name but Christine just calls her Isabelle. It's a nice name for a horse. If it were up to me, I would've named it something obsure... like "She-nana" or whatever. We brushed her and put oil on her hair to make it all shiny. That took about two hours. We were taking her out and I was about to get on her (what do you call that anyways? boarding a horse? loading myself upon it? be-saddlement?) when Mr. Coons came along and told us to put her back because they were going to take a group photo. We did as told and went back to the group.       A speech was taken place, so were a lot of pictures, and I pretended I was the model for 7-Up in the picture. I sat next to Tressie, the pastor's four-year-old daughter, and held my can of 7-Up while holding a thumbs-up. And of course, my trademarked cheesy smile. I am Uberdork 9.0 Optimized to the Max.       Harold Junior Way accompanied Christine and me back to the horse. But before I went on, I just stared at Isabelle, completely unknowing of what to do.       "What do I do," I said to Christine.    "Well, you put your foot on the (whatever it's called) and you swing your foot over to the other side," she said.    "Are you sure," I said, more of an accusation than a question.    "I think you lack confidence," she said. I just stared at her. I mustered up the confidence within me, which might've been gas who knows, and stuck my foot on that accelerator peddle thingee and ---      WHOOSH! Isabelle started without me.   "HOLY SH**!!"" I screamed. Harold Jr. stopped Isabelle before she could pummel into the gate, me included. By the time she was calmed, one foot was on the foot thingee and the other one was hanging freely. I was hanging on to the horn for dear life and I had almost wet myself.       "I saved your life!" Junior said. I just started laughing hysterically. I righted myself enough to actually get on the stupid saddle and then I hunched over, trying to ignore the previous urge of wanting to wet my pants. I had cussed in a  church picnic . If I was Catholic, I was sure I was going to hell.       That incident was almost forgotten as I needlessly held on the reigns even when I had the inability to actually stir the horse. I started singing cowboy songs, but I didn't know a lot of cowboy songs so I just made up my own. I sang something about riding into the sunset or wanting to drink beer or something. I really can't remember. Oh! I forgot to say yee-haw.       My butt started to hurt a lot so I got off. More like fell off, but off. I went back to the house and got myself some soda. Neda and Yuri were petting the kitties which roam so freely on the ranch. I didn't quite  pet  as I did  antagnoize  but I scored some helium balloons and peer-pressed Neda and Yuri to suck some. YES I AM A BAD INFLUENCE. My good-bye gift to them was a long-lasting addiction to helium. It's priceless, I tell you.       We all sucked a balloon and Tembra Way came over to try. Bob Jones chagrined us for doing it, saying it will kill our braincells. I don't have much braincells to kill, what's a little bit more for the pot? We were like the "bad kids" in the corner, doing all the naughty stuff. It was funny. Sounding like a chipmunk is fun. Next time I suck helium, I'm singing "La Chucaracha." Weee, good times.       People started going home and I helped Christine put back the horse and feed it and other stuff. While we were doing that, we ranted how much guys are bad and icky. I also made the realization that the ranch life is not for me. I'm more into dressing up chihuahuas and hamsters for my own entertainment much to their nonverbal disgruntlement.     Then we went home and I took a shower, trading the stench of horse and kitties with a fresh ginger scent of an exfoliating gel.     I got to go to bed now. See how late this post has been time-stamped. I have to go to my stupid doctor who embarassed me in front my mother just so she can legally tell me I have acid reflux. I don't like her. I will fall asleep and wrap myself with the blanket of RESENTMENT.     = cristie    P.S. Letterman's audience are annoying. They clap too much.
