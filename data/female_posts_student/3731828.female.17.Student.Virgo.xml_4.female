It's my summer vacation now (it's actually the last week of it, then I have one course in this summer high school thing and after that the "real" school starts...) and everything worth writing involves drinking. :P  We were in a bar again and it was a fun night, even tho I'm already home at 1.30 AM. But I'm actually still drunk when writing this! Oh, who cares... :P  A friend of mine turned 18 couple of days ago, and in Finland that means you can buy alcohol and get into most bars. My birhtday is unfortunately in September. Most of my friends are already 18 years of age and they have nothing to worry about if the porter askes to see your IDs... I just have to explain I forgot my IDs at home or something. Well, good thing that they don't ask to see those in every bar. :)
