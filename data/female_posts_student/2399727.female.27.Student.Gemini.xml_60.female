Some days, like today, there are no outstanding incidents to recount, and that seems very depressing perhaps to the reader more than to the writer.    I did chat for some time to my friend on the west coast who became interrupted by a virus attack on her computer (wave out to E. who is probably the only person who reads these mundane pages -- if I'm wrong, please correct me and send me an email!).  It is so nice that technology enables us to keep in touch with such ease and cost efficiency.  Reading about Viktor Frankl.  Need to pick up his book when I return to school after Reading Break.  Did somebody say Reading Break?  Yay...  More to come...
