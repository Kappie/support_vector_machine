My mom wants me to go hang out with my sister and the two boys, but I can't stand how mean she is to them and it just frustrates me. My parents are going to see my grammy, and I hate seeing her..so I dont want to. My mom doesnt really want to tell her that I just stayed home and didnt come because I didnt want to..but I dont really care. I mean, that is the truth isnt it? It angers me that my mom lies to people to make them feel better..but that's how most society is. My mom got a new car today, I didnt like it..but after being in it I decided that I do. It's nice. It has a lot of space, and a lot of cool things inside. I always told myself that Im not materialistic..but I guess I am. I'm one of those people who..when shit is clean has to be clean ALL the way, all the time nothing ever out of place. My mom had a tiny scratch on it and I flipped out. I mean...atleast it takes you from place to place..I'm so picky..and I'm never happy with anything.       Besides that, I had an excellent day with William today. We went to Wegmans with his mom and stuff for no real reason at all. After about an hour or so, we went to Burger King and then we went to rent movies. The movie we rented was okay, but it was korny at the same time. We also rented State of Emergency which I can't play because my sister took my PS2 controller and I cant play it with a regular playstation controller. We also rented NBA Street Volume 2 which is kind of fun. My sister or her fiance are bringing over my other controller so that I can also play State of Emergency tomorrow while being home. I'll probably finish off my last cigarettes, and then that's it. No more smoking after that..I'm done. Or atleast until I am old enough to buy them. *sigh*...I have cramps really really bad. It's gotten to the point where I dont want to take medicine anymore. Bill never wanted to, and now I dont either. I never actually really thought about it until my mom asked why I dont anymore. hmm...I dont know, but anyway..I'm going to go call bill now I guess..      I'll probably write more later.
