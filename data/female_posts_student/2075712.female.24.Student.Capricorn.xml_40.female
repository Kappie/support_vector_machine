Anyways, life is good now meaning = a life that sounds boring.  No drama = boring.  Well, today's post will not be that boring..  Last night I was talking to a friend, V whom I was introduced to by...hmmm, we'll call this female bitch.  We used to all be friends but we lost touch with Bitch when she met this abusive guy who would hit her.  I'm so glad that V told me about Bitch cuz I don't need those type of females around me.  I guess she was very curious to know whether or not me and my boyfriend were fucking.  Umm, reminder to her..we're not in high school...half the college is fucking...that is a stupid thing to be curious about.  If she was so fuckin' curious as to how me and my boyfriend are...she should have asked.  Instead she hung out with a bunch of immature guys who would talk about whether or not we fucked.  So these guys would ask her "Do you think they fuck ?" and she would tell these guys that she doesn't know because we aren't even affectionate towards eachother and other comments leaning towards the fact that we are not like a normal couple (I guess what she does with her boyfriend is "normal" - make out, get touchy feely to the point that they look like they're about to fuck, get beat up  all of this is done in front of whoever is around). Umm, sorry bitch, but I've already finished high school and doing what OTHER people think is cool.  I'm not fucking dying of horniness....like her  that fucker who she was talking to....I get  some  of whatever I want whenever I want.  It pissed me off...because I've had to deal with too many stupid females like her.   I've had my share of sneaky jealous females and I don't need any more in my life.  I guess it kind of hit a soft spot for me cuz my best friend let's her boyfriend say stupid shit like..."You better give her love otherwise she's gonna find somebody who will".  Ummmm, excuse me but I love my boyfriend and he loves me.  We don't have to practically fuck in front of everyone so that  they  think that we love eachother. Nobody has any idea what I want or don't want except for my boyfriend.  I'm assuming it's jealousy that consumes people, so they have to find something that they think is wrong.  We don't feel it necessary to show everybody what we do behind closed doors.  He also does not hit me, does not call me names, does not ask me "if I want to suck somebody's dick" for talking to another guy (Bitch who talks shit about how we don't show eachother affection is in a relationship with a guy that does all of these things to her), and we have been going strong for almost 5 years (on November 22nd).  I don't know anybody at my age that has managed to keep a job, go to school,  maintain an relationship with their friends, family, and boyfriend. Amongst all things, I'm happy.   I've had too many jealous bitches try to act like they have the right to say anything....when in all reality, they just wish they had something like what i've got.  Situations like the one with Bitch remind me of this song by Mya called "How you gonna tell me ?" Here's one little quote from the song:   "At least if you're gonna try to give advice about my life,  have your own shit right Cuz you ain't even livin' what you preach to me So please how are you gonna tell me ?"   I had to express my feelings about that...it bothered me so much cuz I was really nice to this girl and she was busy telling everyone we know how she doesn't know why we are together since we don't even seem to like eachother.  Looking at the positive side...At least now I know that when I have a gut instinct about somebody I should listen to it.  I used to always tell my boyfriend...there's something about her that makes me not trust her.  I just couldn't figure out what it was.  I am very naive and can be taken advantage of easily.  It has happened to me many times.  That's why I've got to learn to stay away from people like her.   "Jealousy is a mother fucker, you weak jealous mother fucker !" ~Biggie  Anyways...now that i have that out of my system I feel much better. Life goes on.  I will continue with my great little life...=P
