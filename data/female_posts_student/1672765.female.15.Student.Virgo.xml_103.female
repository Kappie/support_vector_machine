I don't know why I do this, but I noticed nobody else does. Just for example, one of the reasons I was angry was something that happened between me and my sister. She's still mad as hell. I've forgotten about it. Why stay mad? I don't get it. Just don't get it.  When people have the choice of letting things go and being happy and staying angry and being upset, everyone choices the latter.  WHY?   Someone explain it to me, please.
