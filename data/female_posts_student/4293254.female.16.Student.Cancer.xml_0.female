I'm down, that my boyfriend is leaving for Elon this weekend. His parent's won't let him have the fucking car even though he's paid at least a good $1000 on it. And it's not like they need it either considering they have two cars already. I'm overwhelmed by my honors classes and I doubt the homework will be letting up anytime soon. I know I'm screwed for this year. I'm going to end up at the bottom of my class I see it already. I'm a failure. I wish they'd stop posting grades because I compare myself to others(even though the names aren't listed). I see it already. Branded across my forehead: FAILURE AT LIFE! I can't believe what I've become. I love my hate myself and hate myself all in one futile breath. Is this all I think to myself, before I pull my face out from the pillow in the morning. Sometimes I wish I could lie there all day. Somedays I think I'm dead walking around in some girls body, then again maybe I am... Maybe this is just the clueless ramblings of my depression. Why am I this way? Am I getting suicidal I think to myself? I constantly think of placing the knife into my veins over and over again until I'm drenched in blood. Is this a beautiful thought? I don't know. This quickly moves out of my head. I'm better now, I don't want to return to the places I've been I can do better than THAT. I'm soooo fucked up right now, then again, when will I not be fucked up? -Nikki
