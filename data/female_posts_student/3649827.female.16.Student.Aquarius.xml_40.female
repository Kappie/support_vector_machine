BECAUSE i don't seem to have classes with ne1 at all. i have one class with vince and thats it.   and it makes me oh so sad. well it does. next year is going to suck if i don't have ne1 in my classes to sustain me.    you should be in my space, you should be in my life     you should be in my space, you should be in my life     YOU COULD BE IN  MY   SPACE.        and then mrs. perry knew what i made on my ap scores and stuff. she said she was proud of me. that was nice. she's the kind of person you just feel like you don't want to disappoint.   i need ppl from my bubble to be in my classes =\   who else goes to this school anyways? we're the oly ones afterall....   haha maybe not.   and oh yeah, so i thought i was gonna get my driver's license today, but that didn't work out either. and it all sucks.   i need a paul banks in my life. *is a dork and apologizes*   well i'm  supposed  to be doing some kind of productive work. but i don't feel like it.   so i'mma be stalkerish and look interpol stuff up.
