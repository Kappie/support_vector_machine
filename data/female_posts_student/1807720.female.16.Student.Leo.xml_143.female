This morning Mrs. J was like "Hey Vanessa, your in my bio class" and I was like "WHHHATTTTT?!?!?!?????!!!!"  At first I was shocked, then just happy.  I am soooo happy I got my favourite teacher in the entire world for Bio.  Of course it kind of blows that 90% of my class is in grade 10.  It's also ironic because I sit in the same corner and desk in Bio now, as I did in Science 10.  Notice how I always end up siting in corners?!??  -It's like everytime I take some sort of science, guess who ends up sitting in an isolated corner - ME!  But yeah today was good.  Drama was awesome!!  Active Living was cool cause our class is small and I know a couple people, and today Justin Pono - the guy that used to hate me and always call me ugly was like "Hey, How's it goin'?"  So yeah people were nice, my schedule worked out soooo incredibly nice.  I am still mad at you-know-who but whatever.  And well I umm lost my wallet.  That's right, my wallet.  It had my new bus pas, my learners, debt card, YMCA membership, student ID, and well some money too.  Now I can't do anything fun cause I have no money!! GRRRR.  O well, hopefully it will turn up, but I feel happy for some reason even though losing my wallet was stupid and sucks, I still feel REALLY HAPPY! :)
