[as most of you are awear, i happen to be a big fan of 6 Feet Under (the show of course) and as y'all know, it's about these brothers inheritting a mourge and all the shits and giggles they endure along the way.  this show has got me thinking, and i've been thinking, what the hell is the big deal about what coffin you have?  can someone explain to me what need for comfort a CORPSE has?  and what is the point of the little lacey pillows that prop them up like their a puppet or something?  i mean, shitty that they died and all, but is it going to make anyone feel better if their in a nice box vs a crappy clap-board box?  who suffers if i get burried in a plywood crate?  my corpse that's going to get eaten by bugs one way or another.  oh, and please explain embalming to me.  i don't see what the point is.  are they not going into the ground or being burnt?  aren't we organic, thus we decompose and actually help the earth... what the hell has embalming fluid ever done for the earth?  you can't actually tell me that putting that crap and overly varnished wood into the ground is good for anything.  woot for mummification... that atleast has some kind of history to it.  caskets are simply another way to flaunt wealth.  "well i could afford a dark mahogany 10 footer for my husband.  it's trimmed with blue lace and it has a foot rest for him!"  "my husbands in a cardboard box because he thought that spending $9,000 on a box that no one will ever see again was a complete and total waste of money."  coutose to mr. cardboard.  he's got his priorities in order.  next months morgage, THEN casket with foot rest and cup holder.    [i was getting a little riled up there.  but give me credit, leslee and shannon never talk about coffins and dead people.  lmao, it's late, and this is what happens!  --relax said the nightman, we are programmed to recieve, you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.--
