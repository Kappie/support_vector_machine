I think that's when I think the best though, which in a way is good because lately everyone's been pissin me off. Everyone says their own family is screwed up but I seriously don't think they can compare to mine. Well I'm not going to get into that at the moment.   So much stuff is happening right now. Our band concert was last night, and it was my last one. It's actually really depressing. Now I'm starting to worry about whether switching to drama was the right thing. Next year is stressing me out and it hasn't even started yet. I don't think that's a good sign. Man school's so difficult. To make things even worse everyone in school is changing. EVERYONE. I know everyone says things change, but it's just so weird. People are hanging out with different people and everyone's personalitys have totally changed. Does anyone else realize this or is it just me? I think I've changed a bunch this year as well. I think I've gotten a lot more independent. I'm starting to really appreciate solitude. Everyone's telling me I've changed too. A lot of people told me I look a lot different than I did last year. I think I look the same but I don't know.   I'm going to be an aunt soon. How weird is that? Aunt Sharon. I think it sounds good. I still can't believe my sister is having a baby girl, OR the fact that she is no longer Robin Levine but now Robin Cooper. It's so weird. Everythings happening all at once. Robin AND Forrest have actually moved into our house. That's right MY HOUSE. I always thought married couples were supposed to go get starter homes, but NO my parents had to let them live with us. (more evidence of them going psycho) Well I guess that just goes back to the fact that my family can't ever do anything normal. I did get a TV though, which is a key element of my plan to live in my room.   I'm going to see Phantom of the Opera tomorrow. I'm so excited. I heard it's really good. We have good seats too. Well actually I'm not exactly sure where they are but they BETTER be good for what we paid for them.   Proms coming up and everyone's going. It's not fair. I want to go. All these sophomores are going and sophomores aren't supposed to go. I don't like it, we're suposed to have to wait until we're juniors. All tradition is lost. O well I'm going to wait. (but that's just because I don't really have many upperclassman guy friends)   Well It's almost 10 and I REALLY have to get to work on my poetry project. I have a strong feeling I'm going to be up till 3am Sunday night anyways..........
