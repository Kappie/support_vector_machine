I was thinking how  urlLink Libby  is a good friend. And how her comment was very correct. We go through all this shit to be better people. To be able to deal with future problems...I have a theory the problems will get worse, maybe less frequent, but harder to deal with.  I assume this means that I  (small interuption - --cut this because I changed my opinion--)   am going to face some tough shit in my life.    Yes, I cussed. But  urlLink Libby  did first!
