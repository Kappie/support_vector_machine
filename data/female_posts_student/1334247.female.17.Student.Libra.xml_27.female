Kayla wants to go out to eat with me and then have me spend the night, but I'm not feeling it-if it were someone else.... It's also 4th of July weekend. There's probably a few parties that are going on. Exciting. I guess the Ft. Madison fireworks are supposed to be the best ever, so that's exciting. Sunday I go to Dad's for 4 weeks. I really need to pack.
