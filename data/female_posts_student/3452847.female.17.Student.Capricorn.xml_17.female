And we had to chat about stuff, i couldn't tell him i didn't think i could go out with him because i still had feelings for Jason. Thats not fair, thats not his problem, its mine, and i should deal with them as i see right. Jason has Laura round now and i'm sure hes making a play for her... I don't think she likes him like that but she does have reputation... Thats just wrong of me..  ~Lisa~
