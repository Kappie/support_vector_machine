And somehow i started talking about my dads family and how they havent spoken or seen me in over 10 years. i started crying and telling her all about how my dad saved all my pictures, and poems and everything in his house and displays it. and i told her how there was this gap i needed to fill. and how all i wanted was for his family to take a moment and think about me. Saturday, im going over to my cousin Kay's house where my Aunt Gale will be. Interesting, the names sound so fimilar, but i cant put a face with the name. I think its my Aunt Gale, it might be Aunt Holt..i think it's gale though. She called my dad earlier and told him she would be in town, both aunts live about a little over an hour away from my dads house, and kay is in town. So..maybe they were thinking of me, and thats why she called. I dont know, but she didnt ask to speak to me. My dad said "yeah, shes sitting right here" when he said that i instantly was like.."omg what do i say to them?? just say.."hello, how are you doing? its so nice to hear from you! cant wait to see you.." and all these possiabilites. But does she ask to speak to me? no. I'm sitting there on the couch watching tv and her voice is less than 5 feet away...and she doesnt ask to speak to me? Part of me wishes they regretted now speaking to me in over 10 years. I want them to be embarrassed. I dont want to rebulid a realtionship, even though part of me does. Im confused. But i do all of this for my dad. It means a lot to him. I still dont tell him that i know he really bought the gifts his "sisters" sent me. It almost makes me want to cry again. Thinking of how much he wants me to be accepcted, and how his bitch sisters wont accpect the fact that, yes, i am their realtive by blood. hopefully everything will go smoothly..i hope so. i hope i have to eat all the words i just said. I hope i enjoy them and who knows, we might actually do something fun.   *much love*
