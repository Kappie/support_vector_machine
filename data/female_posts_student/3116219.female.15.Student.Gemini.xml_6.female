Melissa and me went shopping and I got more clothes. Later that night I played Poker, Egyptain Ratscrew and Go fish with Matt and Mike. They are so funny when they bitch at eachother. I should film it sometime. They are always at eachothers throats....I'd like to know how they have stayed friends with eachother for so long cause they fight all the time. Well on Sunday I helped open the pool. I had to clean the pool benches with Soft Scrub and a scrub brush...oh yes so much fun. Suprisingly the pool is clear with sand at the bottom which means it should be ready (hopefully) by Wednesday. Yeah the party should be fun. I also got a voicemail from Tyler today! I haven't talked to him in like a month and he wanted to know how I was doing and how Michigan was. Well etleast someone cares about me! Ha that voicemail made my day. No guys I'm not crushing on Tyler, we are just good friends who have a boatload of stuff in common.
