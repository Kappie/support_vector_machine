John has been divorced three times and has two kids ages 10 and 8 that he has full custody of. The man is 47 years old and the most boring person I know. John was complaining that he has no where to meet women and refuses to go to bars and night clubs because he says he can't stand the smoke and how he smells after. He is a nonsmoker. Ok he is telling me about these women he wants to ask out. One works at a gas station he goes to and another one is at this coffee spot. I always tell him to ask the women out and take them to a movie or something. He says that isn't good because you can't talk. I said that it is good to be in public and after the movie you could go for coffee and talk than. He says he wants to invite the woman to his house for supper. Ok I tell him that no woman in their right mind is going to go over to his house because they don't know him from Adam. I started to get a little sick of his pissing and moaning and told him that most women wouldthat to be really boring. The man is boring!!!    I have this friend named Tonya and John keeps asking me to set him and her up. Mind you she is 27 and he is 47 with gray hair and big glasses. He told me that he thinks she is fine and he wants to get a piece of ass. All he wants to do is screw her. I have to laugh because why the hell would I set him up with my friend knowing he just wants sex. He thinks he can get her into bed and likes to inform me that he can give woman 3 to 5 orgasmsand goes into the details. Like I really want to hear how he goes down on someone. I'm like mister you must be doing something wrong to have been married three times and the longest lasted only 5 years.    John also thinks that he is the worlds greatest father. His house is a mess and he went crazy charging up computers and stuff on his credit card. He said he was going to claim bankruptcy three years ago. Any way he thinks he is the father of the year and I tell ya I just don't see it. John tells his kids to much about his personal problems with his last ex-wife. He is in a custody battle because he wants to move out of the state and he will talk about his ex and the crap going on in front of them and makes her look like a monster. I feel he lives through his kids and treats them more like mini adults and that's just wrong. I firmly believe that if he is having problems with her the kids don't need to know. I have called over to his house like about 9 o'clock and he will just be feeding his kids supper. The man gets off work at five o'clock. Am I like a moron here but my kids are already in bed by that time. He has called me during the week and it would be around 9:30 or 10 and he will be yelling for his kids to hurry up and get into the shower.   Maybe I am just a bitch but I think the guy is a fruit cake and he thinks he is all that and a bag of chips. I DON'T THINK SO!!!!
