I will put my more deep thoughts here and maybe I will share those thoughts with the other blogs butthat is up to me.   I have been reading this book called"No Compromise: the Life Story of Keith Green" This book has made me think a lot. I think that itis perfect timing that I am reading it now. I am in Thailand. Ihave been here beforeand I felt like God told me I can come. I won't say thatHe called mehere because I asked Him if I could come and He said yes. Or soI thought. I mean there has to be a reason Iam here because Igot time off of work and I had the money and got a scholarship from school to go. All the doors swung open in about a weeks time. It was crazy! So I felt like there was a reason for me being here.   I got here and there was nothing for me to do. The Thai people do everything.That  is the way that it is supposed to be. I feel like I am doing nothing.That I am wasting my time here. That I could be at home pouring into my high school kids. I feel useless here. Then I pray because I know that there is a reason and I just don't know it.   Here are my thoughts on why I am here. One, to be alisteningear. I get here and the day that I arrive Fai gets here. She was here when I was here last time and she moved to Mae Sot (in northernThailand) to go to school and teach some classes. One nightshe was here we stayed up till way after one. She talked the whole time. She told me about the people who are in her classes. Some of them give her heart ache. She is discouraged by them. She was also telling me about the ministry that she is doing there. The people there want to play "the world's song" as she says instead ofGod's song. They think that Christian music will turn away the people. She also told me of the way that God has been providing for them in the ministry. God is so good. She told me that she was glad that she came at the same time that I did and that shedidn't miss me. This was the first time she came home since leaving. Then I talked to Jen who was here when I was last time and she moved back six months after we left. So she has been here fora year and a half. She told me about all the problems she is having with everyone.Problems with Kelly (the missionary here).She has a job at a public school and she lives on her own. They do not agree with what she is doing, I don't understand why,she feels like they thinkless of her. She calls him for encouragement and all he does is tear her down. Through this whole process she has lost her Hanai sister to the other guy who came at the same time as her. She said that shefeels like she has no one to talk to.  Second, to get some rest. Liz and I went to the floating market and there was nothing to do there. We were in our hotel room talking for a good five hours or so. Not to mention all the rest I am getting here in Bangkok. Third reason I might be here is tobe an encouragement to the Thai staff here. P Dton told me that he was so glad that I came to visit them. When he heard me say that he said that he almost cried. Then later he told me that they love it when I laugh. That it makes them smile or happy, or something. Those are the possibilities except for the last one, God is doing something that I cannotsee.   So I am here feeling useless. I think that it has drawn mecloser toGod. Well at least made me more hungery for Him. Ihave been praying to be more hungry for Him. So this coupledwith the Keith Green book is making some changes in my spirit.I have not come to the part in the story where he gets saved yet but his hunger for God is amazing to me. The book is written by his wifeMelody. Shesays in the book that one thing about Keith was that he was always questioning her. Especially about who she is. I thought that was amazing. I want that. This bookis showing me more of what I want in a husband. Someone who, when he is committed it committed. She said that when God created him thatHe threw away the mold. I want someone who is one of a kind.Healways was striving to find meaning in his life to find God. I want someone who will challenge me. To question me and expect the best that I canbe. Someone who loves me. Someone who is always striving to get the most out of every moment.Someone who causes me to draw closer toGod.   Yesterday in my devos I read 2 Peter. Verses 5-8 really touched me.   "For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." I have been thinking about this a lot. I have always been proud of my faith. Not in a pridefull way just confident. So the verse says to add to my faith goodness. Well I think that I am a pretty good person. Not perfect can always be better. Then I am supposed to add to my goodness knowledge. Well I am going to Bible college. I will get more knowledge there and in doing my devos which I am trying to do better in. To my knowledge self control. Sometimes I do good in this other times I lose it and regret later so definitely something to work on. To self control perserverance. I think that I persevere pretty well but I think that I need more work there.Some times I just giveup like in the boy department. Anyways to perseverance godliness. I am definitely not Godly. I really need to work on this. I need more patience (I guess this applies to self control and perseverance together) more love, more kindness, more forgiveness everything. To Godliness brotherly kindness. I am not very kind to somepeople and I feel bad sometimes. Even if I am nice to some people I don't think that not thinking nice about someone is is brotherly kindness. Then the last one islove. If you look at 1 Corinthians 13 boy do I not have love.I need to remember these things and grow and be more like this. Because,"if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." I don't want to be unproductive and ineffective.
