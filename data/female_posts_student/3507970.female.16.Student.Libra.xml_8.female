Danny:  i've left messages after the tone...  rest of mcfly:  (with american accent) really??  Danny:  (in true grease style) yeah man loads  oh ho!! its brilliant!! they sound so sexy. nazrene reckons she can imagain the mcfly boys at Rydell High. apparently danny would be in the T-birds and so would harry. tom and dougie would be the geeks though, wearing those thick black rimmed glasses. hehe, i can so imagine that, although i aolso reckon that hary could also pull of being a geek as well :-D  *sigh* if only we could be their pink ladies  oh the album, despite its brilliance, does the make mcfly and jamesey bourne look quite pathetic. most of them are all about girls either being too good for them, girls cheating on them , or girls dumping them. most of them were written by tom, james and danny though, so i guess theyre the loosers and harry and dougie are the studs :-D  oh i LOVE the album cover. tis great and wonderfully random. i have no IDEA wot theyre doing, but as queen naz said, wouldnt you SOOO love to know wot they were thinking when they were posing for them. and for those of you who were wondering, harry looks GREAT :-P  anyway, am off to go meet naz later, so must go do something useful before i leave  cya xxx
