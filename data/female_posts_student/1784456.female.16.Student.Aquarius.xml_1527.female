(So I'm left with all the bad stuff... greeeeat) Nah, I'm a happy vibe planet! *should have put plant, but didn't. You know, the erm - industry plant, not a green thing.* Yup, my confused happy vibes (just don't get them angry) Ooh no, that's scary! Uhh... weel how is everyone? Good, good. *imaginary conversation* He stood on your foot?! What??? Air fresheners are .... just CHEAP PERFUME!!!!!
