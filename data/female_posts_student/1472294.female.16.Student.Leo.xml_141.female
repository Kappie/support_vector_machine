And yesterday there was a celebration for Youth Day! DAMN! Anyway, caught up with HP Bk 5 and managed to finish it at about 6pm during this evening reading from Friday to today. In the morning, I went back to school for  Rehersal  (have to stress that...) For Enrolment Service. JEEZZZ.... Okay, back to the book, then the Enrolment Shit. Harry Potter in this book is, eerrmm, like a little harsh and arragont and hot- tempered. Well, who can blame him if he is kept in the dark and he still did not know about his past. I am very disappointed. The ending was so abrupt, at least revealed what he got for his OWLs, like our 'O' Levels.... Well, his godfather died and I felt no feelings. J. K. Rowling cried after 'killing' him. But Harry Potter should be of course sad and grieving but he should also be relieved that his godfather saved him in order to help Harry Potter to live and in turn, Harry Potter gained more friends and knew his past and his future too, where he have to fight with Dark Lord as only one of them could survive.... HP Bk 6 should be quite thrilling. I have also come to realise that Harry Potter is no romantic guy. He REALLLY did not know what is a girl feeling or thinking. I never like Cho Chang to be with Harry Potter. So, imagined the relief when I read that they broke off. I mean, no hard feelings, Cho Chang deserved a better guy to love and care for her. And Harry Potter needs a girl who really understands his feelings and thoughts. OK, back to ES (short form for enrolment shit) I never put bad words unless I really, really hate that event or particular person. So, think how I hate this 'stuff'. Hah! No parade and the whole morning and afternoon BB and GB were rehersing again and again.... I was so hungry and we still had to recieve the badges. I only recieved 1 badge and not promoted to staff sergent. DAMN! X2 And we still had to stand between the BB boys. Jeezzz... It has been 2- 3 years since we done this " Highly and Dangerous Performance" So that part we spent a lot of time and effort on it.... The singing part was so boring. I never even open my golden mouth. If they ever ask me to sing, which they never, I will tell them I had SORE THROAT! Well, the event is next week and I really dont feel like going. But for the sick of my CCA points, I will grit my teeth filled with braces and do it....
