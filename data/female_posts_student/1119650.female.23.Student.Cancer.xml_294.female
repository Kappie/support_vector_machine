I learned that having never run a day in your life and having just quit smoking a lil while ago, that it is absolutely, unequivocally unrealistic to expect to RUN 1 mile in the morning.  However I do have a lovely neighborhood to take a brisk walk in, so I did that.  Hopefully I will build up to running.  Any runners have any suggestions on how to "build up to it"?
