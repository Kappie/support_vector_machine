Instead they just get the rotten apples that are on the ground, that aren't as good, but easy.  So the apples at the top think that there is something wrong with them, when in reality, they are amazing.  That is why we just have to be a little patient and the right boy, the one who takes a chance to find the good, right apple, will come someday...  This is true about all of you ;) and i found it in my saved e-mails bunch and couldn't resist on reminding you all.
