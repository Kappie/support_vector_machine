Suddenly this golf ball drops out of nowhere and goes right in front of my bike, then THROUGH the wheels and in front again. It was the scariest thing, knowing that I almost was KILLED or at least seriously injured by this thing. I took the golf ball, that freaking psycho ain't getting it back so he can take me out again! And I'm never biking that trail again, for my safety.  I made some bracelets out of my starburst wrappers. That was fun. They are so bright and colorful.   Going to play pool with people tonight, fun fun.  Can't wait til Sat, only two more days...And Laura's home! A week early! Yay!!!! *sniffles* I really missed her too:P
