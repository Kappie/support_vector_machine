And now, when he finally had the power to help her diectly, she spurns him.  Damien's anger boiled out of him and into the surrounding landscape. Lightning flashed and earth rumbled. "How is she meant to kill a vampire who is alive, not even undead, without the power of the dead behind her? Doesn't she realize what she's up against? Marion is a vampire who endures sunlight, who feeds on death, is fuelled by Death and is protected from death by Death. Can't she abandon her pride long enough to realize that she needs the help of one of the dead, to accept her weaknesses long enough to stay alive?" Damien's anger suddenly turned to grief and a river of salty water surrounded him. "Tittanya, I'm sorry." His voice was a bare wisper. "I shouldn't have let them do it, but I died because of it and now you won't let me repay the debt. Can't you trust me enough to let me bring you here, so you can learn how to rid the world of Marion? I'm sorry." Damien stayed on his island surrounded by the river of his grief, remembering what he did to warrent such a strong rejection from Tittanya.
