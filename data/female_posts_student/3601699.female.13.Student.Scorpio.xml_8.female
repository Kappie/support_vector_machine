Now, technically I should be in French class right now, but my teacher said that we didn't have to go today because Wednesday was apparently our last official day in that class.  Now, following French, I have PE.  However, last night I accidentally fell down the stairs (hey, it was late, ok?) and have injured my left elbow.  We were gonna play tennis today, which would probably kill me in this state, especially since I play tennis with my left hand.  I could probably get away with not going to PE at all, but it's the last day of school and I wanna see people.  I'll probably just get mom to write me a note saying that I can't actually do anything, and just sit there the whole block.
