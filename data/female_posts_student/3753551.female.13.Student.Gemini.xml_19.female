I think im going to go buy a cd today. armor for sleep, dream to make belive.   but anyway, i want to start my random thoughts-on-black-and-pink. *they make me feel better*   we saw spiderman 2 yesterday. it was great. better than the first one.  i think im going to see shrek 2 again or spiderman 2 again tomoro. all my friends have turned into boring bitchy little shits. why, lord? why? but thats okay. they're still my friends, but i think we've all drifted apart over the term and now we're all independent, lonely souls.   *note to self: its hip to be square.*          ARMOR FOR SLEEP ^^ *yay*
