He states that America needs to limit its trade with other countries that would more opportunity to the locals.   But isn’t this the time for globalization?  Shouldn’t all countries inter-connect to make the world one big village? It might cause some kind of elevation in job opportunities, but then would it be more productive? People expect to be paid more to lead a “comfortable life”. But with higher salaries the companies itself would face financial problems.  I think the government should have a better budget planning.  The government should be more people concerned than concerned about their own benefits.
