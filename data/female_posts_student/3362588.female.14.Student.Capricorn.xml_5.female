That would be odd... Definatly very odd. Oh, haha, I was reading some other guy's blog.  It was funny.  He put hair removal stuff on his chest - needless to say he was... sore.  He said every time his clothing rubbed him, hot needles shot throw his skin.  muahahaha.  How wickedly funny.   I almost lost Pukey today.  He flew up in a tree and we couldn't find him.  I was all like, "Ah man!  Clarisa's gonna kill me!!"  But we finally found him and got the dumb bird down.  Then Edgar crawled under a shelf in the garage and while I was getting him out Pukey flew onto the roof.  aHHHHH!!!  Talking about the birds, I'd better go check on them....
