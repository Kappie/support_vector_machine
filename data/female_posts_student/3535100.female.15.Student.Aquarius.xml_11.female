So Tuesday didnt start off all that great had a couple issues...BUT THENTuesdaynight was the shit once again!! :::BIG SMILE:::..Lets see Me Lisa n Chels were drivin around and Tim called and said he was bored so we went and picked him up and went to the Duke..Matt called Tim and was bored so we were gonna go to his house for a lil bit. I rode with Tim so he wouldn't have to drive alone or w/e...and Lisa 'n' Chels left before us even though they didnt know where Matt lives and me n Tim were sitting in his driveway bout to pull away when Lisa comes back and says my mom said I need to go home cause she saw Lisa and Chels without me...EeK! So we go to my houe and I explain everything to my mom so Im not in trouble ne more..then we leave to go to Matts and we took the back way. We get to Longrifle and Tim juss starts getting away from her and Lisa n Chels end up fuckin lost as hell! So Tims fone is dead Lisa n Chels went back to Westerville to find Eric and Travis and come to find out theyre on Campus. So we meet up with Lisa and Chelsea FINALLY! and we all go back to Matts crib for a lil bit.

HAHA! So we get to the Duke and Tim gets gas then we sit there and wait for Lisa and Chelsea forever and then they get gas, and I get out of the car the happiest gurl alive...we went to campus to try and find travis and eric but by the time we got there we had to turn around and go home cuz my mom was being gay and made me be home by 11...GRR! but I was still like int eh best mood ever!
