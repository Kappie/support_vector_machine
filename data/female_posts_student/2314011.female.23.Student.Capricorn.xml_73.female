Here I'd spent all last semester waiting for the right time, perfect place, best opening line, trying to calm my fears of rejection and step out of my comfort zone for once...Once!!  And today, I finally took that chance.  There have been signs all along.  She tried to hide her affection beneath a surly, tough exterior, but I saw beyond that.  We joked about the old hometown, laughed at how much we secretly wanted each other.  But underneath, I knew we were laughing about something real.    We planned to meet for beers, and those only lead to bad places; I was counting on it.  I figured such an invitation would be obvious in its entreaty.  After all, we "joked" that our movie and dinner the day after our last final was a date.  Clearly she was sending me signals that she was ready and waiting for me to initiate the next step.  Any remaining shards of doubt vanished when we had our lunch together this afternoon.  It was glorious.  We bonded; we shared things few others knew.  I looked at her; she looked at me.  She finished my olives, for god's sake!  If that's not a come-on, I don't know what is!  So when she called half an hour after our arrangements were made, I was excited.  I thought perhaps she couldn't wait to see me and wanted to move our plans up a bit; or maybe she had to tell me something too difficult to discuss in person.  I tried to sound nonchalant, telling her I was just "reading the newspaper" when I was actually admiring her picture in the law school's directory, as I have a tendency to do quite often, when all my life seems to shrink and the darkness curls up around me.    "Listen, uhh.." she said.  It sounded serious.  My heart was pounding; this was it!!  "...I have bow out of tonight."  Crushing.  Tumbling down a rocky mountain-side onto a torn, jagged terrain not entirely unlike the broken floor of Mordor.    "Oh?" I recovered quickly.    "Yea, I forgot about this thing I'm doing with Mark tonight."  Oh yes, this "Mark" person.  She refers to him on occasion, calling him her "live-in."  It's not entirely certain he even exists.  But I remained calm.    "Okay."  Did that sound too pained?  "We'll definitely do it another time, though," she offered.  Was that hope I heard in her voice?    "Alrighty."  Like when you finally find the courage to admit the truth?!  Such was my date that wasn't.  I'll go on, somehow.  Probably get some coffee next door to the bar that was to be the site of our meeting.  But I won't go in, oh no.  Maybe come home and console myself with Queer As Folk's Season Two on DVD.    But I don't plan on letting myself get this hurt again, not for a very long time.
