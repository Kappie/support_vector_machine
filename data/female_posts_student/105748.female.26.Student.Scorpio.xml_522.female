I hope the guestbook will match the color of my blog just like here in our Golden sushi site.  Will I also be able to respond to people's post just like your guest book?  In regards to the webcam, will it take too long for people to get into my blog if I have it installed? Let me know if you need anything? Thanks for all your help!
