Graduation - Vitamin C  In a way, I almost don't want Grade 11 to end. As much as I complain and talk about school being boring and such, I'm really scared for next year. I'm even scared for this summer. This'll be the last summer where I know that in September, I'll still be here. With my friends and everything that's been familiar to me for the last seven years. Come summer 2005, I'll be packing. Possibly moving to another province. I'm excited for this new chapter in life, but it scares the DAYLIGHTS out of me. New school, new people, new surroundings, new home (possibly). I'll be 18. I'll be legal. I gotta do my own LAUNDRY. (Not that I don't right now, but it's nice to have Mom help out a lot.)  There's so many people that I love and that I could never leave behind and yet, I will have to do just that when I go off to school next year. I can't explain this sense of mixed dread and anticipation that lies within my heart. It's frightening. Sometimes, I'll sit in my room, listen to music (specifically songs like The Verve's  Bittersweet Symphony  or David Usher's cover of  Fast Car ), and I cry. Not because I'm sad, but because I'm so excited and so scared at the same time. I know God has a plan for me and that things will work out in the end, but not knowing what that plan is makes me feel so blind. I understand that whatever lies in my future may take a lot of strength to complete, but... oh, my heart is so heavy with thoughts.  I'm excited for the all-nighter. It's things like these that create memories for me. Years from now, I'll still remember Matt's love of locomotives. Anne's uncanny ability to make people happy. Andrew's constant battles of logic. Ben's unwavering love of music and Jesus. Sam's strength and determination. Dyllan. (Just Dyllan because everything about him is fantastic.) Lauren and our hilariously aimless car rides to Tim Horton's and back. I love everyone one of you and I thank you for the impression you have left on my heart.
