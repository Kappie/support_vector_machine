I woke up to a hot shower this morning, which I haven't done in a long time.  It was nice.  I actually felt awake.  And I got up early to do it, so there was plenty of time left to have a good breakfast.  I let my hair do its own thing.  It smiled and thanked me for not burning it.  The morning passed fairly uneventfully.  It sounds strange, but I feel like I'm on my own, in the best sense.  Every class is different.  I feel more individual.  It is great, because I never tire of the gang.  And I look forward to seeing them at lunch.  We were discussing this at dinner.  It is funny how I've stayed so close to the people with whom I have no classes.  All you need is good conversation and lots of bonding time, even if it's outside school.  By sixth period today, I was in love with everyone and everything.  Then in Mrs. Krizmanich's class, we had a quiz on Jane Eyre.  I freaking loved that book, and I actually read it on time and knew it all.  I think I got every question right.  I was actually enjoying answering the questions; I probably elaborated more than I needed to.  I was in such a good mood that Mr. Kifner was not annoying me at all.  I realized that he is liberal, and I agree with his opinions in some ways.  Maybe it was my mood talking, but I thought to myself, I'm really going to try harder in this class.  There's no reason at all to slack off at this point.  So I dug in.  I even told him to have a good weekend as I left.  I don't think I've ever done that, or even considered doing it.  So C and C was inspiring.  After reading pretty much all of Jane Eyre in three days, I feel absolutely no inclination to halfass my way through the rest of this year.  None. The bus was annoying.  I cannot stand some of those people.  I stick out like a sore thumb; everyone seems to have adopted the same clothing, conversation and personality.  I must not have gotten the memo.  But the walk was nice, as it was GORGEOUS outside today.  When I got home, I actually got all my rides to Enloe and the Mellow Mushroom and back home arranged.  I am still surprised at how it worked out.  Acting Night was fun.  You all did a fabulous job!  We had a good time at the Mellow Mushroom; it's nice to stay out late.  Unfortunately we couldn't go down to Helios afterwards.  But it was ok.  I was still in love with everyone.  When I got home, my mother noticed a change in me.  "You just look different.  Like you're more comfortable and composed, or something.  You're not the same as you were yesterday."  I'm not sure what that means.  I sat in my room and just stared at the clock on my wall and thought.  I thought about school and music and film and my family and friends.  I thought about how life was a year ago, and I realized what complete and utter hell that was.  If I had not moved away from it all, I really might've gone insane.  I needed to document this.  I know this all probably sounds really cheesy, and that I may just be in that dumb whatdoesitallmean phase, the perfect clich√© of an American teenager.  But I can't help it. It is Saturday now.  I've been writing this on and off for probably close to an hour.  Wow, this is a really personal post.  Now the whole world knows, and I am so totally ok with that.  I hope this quiet euphoria lasts a little longer.  But I fear that it will exhaust with time and some sleep; tomorrow will not be the same. Maybe it's just that I had the first really good day of my life.  Who knows.  God, what wonders a hot shower first thing in the morning can do.
