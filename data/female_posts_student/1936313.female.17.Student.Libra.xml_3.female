We shall start with the flight....  THE FLIGHT WAS FREAKING HORRIBLE!!! Done. 4 hr lay over in Calgary.. BORING... then they made us wait while they got some poor guy on a stretcher onto the airplane... heh.. only amusing part of the wait.. all the stewardesses kept lecturing "Hey! Just be glad its not you on that poor stretcher!" 8.5 hr flight to London Heathrow. I shall put in here that I HATE HEATHROW AIRPORT. There is no such thing as air conditioning in England... and the Queues (sp) wound allll through the customs room... it was hot and stuffy and there were enough Japanese tourists to make anyone sick... (I don't actually mean that to sound racist... if it does I'm sorry...)  England is rainy and windy. Don't mind the rain.. but the wind kept us at Heathrow for an aditional 2 hrs because the gusts made it unsafe to take off in a small bmi plane. None the less we made it over safe.. Hooray!... Next... the wedding...  THE WEDDING WAS FANTASTIC! At the Lancashire Cricket Club.. beautiful grounds.. hotel rooms.. lovely food.. Not to mention My Cousin Paul and Helen absolutely glowed despite the rain. Photographs were a pain in the butt... I wasn't in the wedding party but they made me take these silly photos out in the wind because we were the family from Canada and had travelled the furthest... oh well.. i was freezing but the alcohol made up for that (-didn't just say that-)  Day after the wedding... and everyones recupperating....yes... me included.. no lecturing.. Blame my father... and my Uncles... they kept putting it in front of me... Sooo now we're hanging about waiting to wish Paul and Helen off on their honeymoon... back to Canada (irony....i know) I met my new baby cousin William (8 months old) was the only baby who... didn't cry through the ceremony but laughed.. he is the happiest baby i have ever seen... quiet.. doesn't cry much... and has the most infectous laugh ever.. he smiles and laughs at everything.. certainly knows how to play up to a crowd... pictures to come very soon!  Hoping to get to see Romeo and Juliet or The Merchant of Venice at one of the Theatres when we go to London next weekend. Unfortunately the Globe Theatre is closed until May (I am ticked off... very angry.. grrrr to Shakespeare) so we have to find them somewhere else... they play at Stratford as well.... Dads Birthday is next weekend so we're all getting together for that......  A little spotchy this entry... I've loads more details on the wedding to fill through... just settle that it was lovely.. and I'm suffering a lil bit of jetlag and -coughshangovercoughs- shhhhhh again.. I'm sorry.. shutting up now and wandering off to do some homework.. wish Paul and Helen off and then go to bed.... keep in touch all!
