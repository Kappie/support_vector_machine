Cold Creek Manor  thats what i couldnt remember. its a good  mystery  movie! i liked it but some people might be like   "...oh it was so fake..."   in the middle of the movie you will know who is the bad guy and so then after that the movie kind of drags along but other than that its pretty good. i dont know if i'd want to buy it but definately i'd like to see it again. and oh, we get  SHREK 2  on friday!!!!!
