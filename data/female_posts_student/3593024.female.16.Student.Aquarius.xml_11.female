Anyways when I got online I was so excited to hear that Amber and Sarah were on talking terms again now I hope that things get better instead of worse b/c I miss hanging out with the both of them and this whole thing was just a big mess.  I think they are going to spend the night tonight and I am pretty sure Lauren might spend the night also, that is pretty cool b/c Lauren is awesome, and it will just be cool to be hanging out with my friends seeing as how Saturday I leave to go out of town and I dotn get back till Monday and then Tuesday we go back to school so my summer kind of ends Friday Night. :(  Man have I had a blast this summer I dont know what it would have been like if I didnt have the friends I have.  i spent most of the summer with Sarah that is no surprise and I was so EXCITED to start hanging out with Brandy again b/c she has always been one of my best friends and I cant believe I ever stopped talking to her.  This summer has been pretty interesting actually.  At the beginning of the summer I was getting ready for my sisters wedding which was a blast, but mine is going to be better.  Sarah, Pt, and Keith were there and they met my uncle Jody and his family they loved him and he loved them.  About a week after that I broke up with Ketih b/c he cheated, but what can you do?  Forgive and Forget?!  Then I just hung out with Sarah and Jared and Steven a couple of times.  That was cool went to some of the guys summer league games.  When we went to one of them there was a fight that was cool.  Then July came and I went to Padre with Sarah and her mom that was a blast it was so pretty down there and I want to go back without a parent and just like a group of friends.  I hung out with Crystal Mikey and Jack and Abel a littl bit this summer that was a blast.   I went camping wtih them twice.  The second time was better b/c we went to turner falls and Sarah went with us and I had a blast it was pretty but too many Mexicans.lol   I also had a fourth of july party which was ok except some girls need to learn how to not bother ppl.  Went to the Movies a couple of times.  Found out Steven really needs to get some from someone b/c he is so HORNY....lol and he is also scared of Scary movies and that is hilarous.  It is winding down to the last couple of days for me and the carnival is here and that is pretty cool.  I went to the carnival Monday with Sarah and then tuesday with Amber and Lauren met us up there.  Today I think Sarah might go and Amber and Lauren and I are going to go ride the rides I am pretty excited I love these rides.  They are going to spend the night at my house tonigth and we might camp out but I dunno.  I cant wait to go out of town b/c this will be like our last family vacation for a good long time, I mean like are whole family is going to go see our other family this will be kind of sad I miss my brother and sister.  Well I got to go ttyl    Love always'   Jess
