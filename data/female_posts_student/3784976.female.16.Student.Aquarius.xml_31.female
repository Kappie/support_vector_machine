So we had steak, mmmmm steak, and corn on the cob!  I was such a ditz durring supper, and I forgot to mention that my two nephews were there too.   Rylan, who is 1 1/2, ate 1 1/2 ears of corn.  He is a chunk.  OMG!  And then afterwards we took them back to my grandmas house so we could play crouquet.  Ben won everytime, I came in last and third.  He is evil, but ya..it was still fun.  That was my night, so far.  Maybe if I feel like it I will write in here some more later tonight...maybe not. So just in case I don't I will tell you goodnight now, and have a grrrreat day tomorrow!  k-
