Just not my thing.   Everything's not my thing. LOL. I'm such an idiot. Why can't I just go with the flow of everything? Anyways, back to the Father's Day topic, my dad- typical him, he gets paiseh when you offer to buy anything for him.   1. I don't know what books he likes. The books I know he likes cost like RM400 and can't be found in Msia.  2. He wants a set of weights, but when we take him out to choose em, he'll divert and we'll end up buying him a drink :| 3. I could write him a poem on how much he means to me and those soppy stuff but my mom wouldn't agree - tak cukup 'class'... tau?   Ah well, I bought him this porcelein frog which looks like the stray frog he found in our garden and got attached to it, even named it Froggie but it ran away somewhere. So porcelein to replace it.   Oh, and my mom asked me to put in a reincheck sorta voucher thingy for a set of weights. We'll see whether ia jadi atau tak.   Goodnight, gotta finish up me KH project. Yeah and my first piece Allegro by CPE Bach is getting worser every time i practice. I'm doomed. DOOMED.   -Mary-RuthLowErn-Lyn (3 hyphens in a row hehe)
