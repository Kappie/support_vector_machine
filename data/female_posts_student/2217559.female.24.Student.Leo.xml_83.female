The cleanest air I have ever breathed, the coolest clothing stores, and the best coffee north of California. I did nothing tourist-y today - just wlaked around wearing my white collared shirt with red sweater layered over and my black jacket, jeans  tennis shoes. It was about 59 degrees, overcast and rainy.  I ate sushi at a proper restaurant (minus my shoes) located above some cute shops facing the downtown district.  Drank hot tea and laughed with Helen over stupid things.  Afterwards we went to the coolest bookstore and hung out for a couple of hours, sitting on the floor, listening to music and drabbing around the travel section.  I did my usual walk-over to the reference center and contemplated what language I want to teach myself when I get home.  First picking up the french guides, then on to greek guides before racking my brain over mandrin chinese  - I do this every time I go into every bookstore now - always in the same order - some type of OCDism I am suffering from. Hahaha. Anyway, we picked up coffee at Tim Horton's and sat outside on the porch, smokin, watching the rain and people surfing.  It was the greatest day ever and I did nothing out of the ordinary.   I bought this incredible bootleg cd of Sarah McLachlan - wow, just looked outside the window and noticed that we were sailing out of the port..... Bye, Vancouver! Anyway, this cd rocks - it's with the freedom sessions and all of the versions are previously unreleased. She sings Ol'55 and I have never wanted to "ride with Lady Lcuk" so badly before.  Yowsers, it reminds me of why I love music so much.   I can't get over how beautiful Vancouver is.  I mean, the mountain back drop is incredible - white capped with snow and all the wee houses are perched so elegantly at the bottom. We will be back here on the 19th and I plan to truly spend some time in the gardens which I have heard are amazing to see. Tomorrow we are cruising the inside passage which is supposed to be pretty neat - huge trees on both sides of the ship. I guess I will have ot take some photos.  I took some today but mainly it was of the metropolitain district.   Okay, now, Hummel Hummel.  In Hamburg, Germany the locals shout this at everyone but apparently it's the only place in Germany where they say these things.  One Hamburg says to the other, "Hummel Hummel" and the other says, "Mosh Mosh."  I still haven't gotten the right translation but it's something like, "Screw you." and th other says, "Screw you too."  But apparently, old women to young kids say this as a greeting.  Hahaha, is that psychotic or what?  So, I said to Nils last night - "Hummel Hummel" ad he just looked at me like I had lost my mind.  Then responded with the response. It was hilarious.  He's from an island off the coast of Hamburg so he knew exactly what I was saying. Hahaha.    Alright,  I have blabbed enough.  More later.  Oh and 22 days left. Smooches. Shell.
