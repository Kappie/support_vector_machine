Same city, same country, two months after another 2 planes crashed there, something that has never ever happened before, and the people on the news are wondering whether it's a coincidence or not! I don't think so! This time a plane crashed in a town (cant remember the name) on loads of houses and families and people. Is this the Taliban's way of saying "If you kill our people then we'll kill yours" ? Cos they can't talk, they treat their people like dirt. But it is kind of annoying that the deaths in America get all the sympathy and publicity on the news, when really, it's not all that different from what America is doing to Afghanistan, killing innocent people. But some people think that just because they are ruled by the taliban then it's ok to kill them, but it's not. They must be really confused now. The Taliban are horrible to them and they want to be ruled by the west (some of them) but then the west come along and bomb them and kill them. Am I the only person who thinks the whole thing is crazy? How many more people have to die berfore someone admits that they are wrong?
