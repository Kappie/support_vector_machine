And everything is OK with elder smith, because we are allowed to see him as long as he doesn't come over to my house, and as long as he doesn't go out of his zone. mary told me that her friends check my blog! i am so happy! i didn't think that you guys liked me! and mary told me that mark liked me! mark, you're awesome. I find myself very loud. and obnoxious. so anyway... Mom and the little kids have left for france. we'll be leaving on the seventeenth. the house is really quiet. everyone here is just doing there own thing. i don't have anything else to do. so i went to my room. anyway, i'd better clean it, before bugs start to live here. wooops...
