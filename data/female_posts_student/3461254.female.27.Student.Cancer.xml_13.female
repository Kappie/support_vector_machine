My apartment has about 1000 cheap paperbacks and some decent hardcovers, but I still keep returning to an old love: "Good Omens."  It's this great novel written by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett all about a supremely awesome Demon named Crowley, an angel, the Antichrist, and the days leading to the end of the world.    The first time I read it was in 9th grade and I was in the process of getting a really horrible spiral perm at the time, so I missed out on some of the nuances in the story.  Getting the skin burned off one's neck is always a distraction.  I stumbled upon in again at a used book store in East Lansing, whilst visiting my sister at State.  Since that time, I've read it about 7 times, and counting.  Even my sister has read it, and she's usually too busy to do anything but work.  She purchased a newer edition because she claims the smell of mass-market paperbacks turns her stomach.
