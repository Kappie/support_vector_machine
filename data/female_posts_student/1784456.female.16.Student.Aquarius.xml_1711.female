Its 10:14am and i am still in pyjamas cos i cant be bothered to get dressed. according to my mum i am looking for ball shoes and a bag and jewellery. as my dress is lilac i am having silver accessories as i decided it would be too hard to try and find lilac ones!!!!!! *whoever heard of lilac jewellery that wasn't plastic* I had work yesterday adn sepnt most of my time doing my media coursework. it was sooo quiet, just becos there were 3 of us there rather than 2. and the stupid wind kept blowing open the door *which has a beeper* so that kept annoying us cos we thort it was someone coming in to be served. bye bye xx
