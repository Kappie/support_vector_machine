Term 2 works are really getting difficult and i can feel alot of pressure on my brain. So far, i think i failed one or two subjects, English and Math.  I just dun get what my nut math teacher is teaching. He screws my brain up like a blender. My english, hmmm... just by looking at the tittle of the compo, i can really get headache or feel like getting out of the classroom. Becos it is really so difficult until my brain/mind went all blank. Haix.. forget it anyway it is OVER! Hehee... My clique really got some small problem ya... and i am like so blur of not knowing how to help them to get back together. I got to sign off cos i need to SLEEP! HEhee... ohh.. forget to tell you one secret" I... forget what i want to say liao! " .
