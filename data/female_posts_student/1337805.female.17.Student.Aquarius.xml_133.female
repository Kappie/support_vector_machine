The rooms were really well done, and everyone acted out well. I organized the event, so I'm so glad it went off well. Huzzah!  In case you were wondering, the theme was a haunted-type family murder..and you were led from bedroom to bedroom. First the children's room, where there was faint mewing to make the sound of a cat (but it was some furbies i had) and then you were led to the forgotten child's room, Samara (from the Ring). We even had the tv on playing static.  Then they were led into the parents room, where the mom(or dad depending) ran out and killed everyone, and the kids ran out, and there was a dead person at the bottom of teh stairs just before they left. It was a person from the tour group that had gone missing...   Ahh! I'm so happy it went well. Tomorow night, we're cleaning up the space. My only regret is that I never got to play necrophiliac with the dead father...:P Just to be different, and to have fun, seeing as my love life has hit a dangerously not nice stop... Oh well. There's always next year.
