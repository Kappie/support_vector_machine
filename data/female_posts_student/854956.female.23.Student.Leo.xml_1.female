My parents went to Kerrville to do some work at my Grandma's (cause she's moving back in tomorrow) and when they left in the morning, it woke me up.  I tried to go back to sleep, but couldn't.  So I ended up being awake at 10am.  I had breakfast, and attempted watching tv.  There was nothing on.  So I did some laundry.  Then THAT got boring, so I cleaned up the bathroom.  Then I decided to eat some lunch.  After I ate lunch, I took a shower, and after that (since Ricky was in town) I called over there to see what was going on.  He said he was going to get his hair cut, and after telling him about my day, we decided I should get out.  So, he came and picked me up and we went over to the place he gets his hair cut.  Apparently he missed his appointment (but not REALLY... he made the appointment that was written on the calendar).  So, he got something to eat, and then we went over to his house to bug Mike.  His Dad had just gotten home, and told us that he brought home leeches.  So, we went to play with them.  We tried getting them to suck Mike's blood, but they wouldn't.  His Mom got home from her day out, and was grossed out by the leeches.  Anyway, they were all going to go eat with Ricky's cousins and aunt, so I told him when they were done playing with the leeches I should go.  But in the meantime, Patty called over to Kimby's to talk to Trinity, and told her I was coming to dinner.  So I ended up going with them.  We went over to see Trinity, Kimby, and the rest of the bunch.  We went out to eat at Joe's Crab Shack.  Which I thought was sorta ironic right now.  While we were there, Mike kept pushing the idea of me dating Joey Melancon... AGAIN.  He just won't give up.  We left there and went back to Trinity's and were there for about 30 minutes.  I dunno really how long it was, I just know it was long enough for Ricky's Dad to watch the sports stuff.  hehe  Anyhow, we headed back to Ricky's, and attempted the feeding again with the leeches.  Mike used Patty's needle (the one she uses to check blood sugar) to prick himself, and got a leech to attach!  Then that one fell off, and he got another one to suck on that same spot!  YAY!  We got this stuff on tape, and got pictures.  And he was telling his friends online that he had a leech on his finger.  It was exciting!  Then when it was like, midnight, I told Ricky I should probably get home, so I could make an effort to get to church the next morning.  So, when we got here, they came in, because I wanted them to see a thing on the blast! website.... very cool website if you were in marching band, and like to see cool visuals and stuff.  The URL is http://www.blasttheshow.com/blast.html.  Go there if you want.  Then they left, after Mike had made his mess, and such.  It was good times.  Definitely took my mind off the craziness of my life (recently) for a night, which was good.     LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink ">Comment
