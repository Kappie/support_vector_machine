Mark 6:17-29 For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled ; yet he liked to listen to him.  Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.  The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you." And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."  She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?"  "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.  At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."  The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.   A nice happy story, eh? [ I am going to anylize this is parts... what I say I will start with one of these cute "-" things. Got it? Good.]  For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."  -See, as the story goes... Herod had this nice wife and everything was happy. Until he saw Hereodias. [She was also his neice!!] Since he was king and all he was like "Why can't shebe my wife?" so he took her away from her husband, divorced his wife, and married Herodias.  John saw all this crap and, obviously, was like "This is not right!" So he vocalized his opinion, losing the favor of Herodias.-   So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled ; yet he liked to listen to him.   -But Herod still liked him!! [another thing, grudges are dumb! Just forgive and forget.]-  Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.   -When they say "dance" this isn't like the twist or something. This was a vulgar sensual dance. Obiously, the men were "pleased"-  The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you." And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."  She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?"  "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.  At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."   -So, the always loving mother, Herodias uses her daughters sensuality to get exactly what she wants. Nice mom.-  The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.  -The king was distressed!! See, he liked John the Baptist. But, because of his guests he crumbled in and agreed. This is an example of peer presure. Usually, you see peer pressure in less harmful ways but it can be this bad.-  So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.   So there goes the greatest disiple man of all time.. [Matthew 11:11 I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.] all that because of peer pressure.  let me tell you, as Christians we CANNOT be people pleasers.  People aren't going to like us, thats just the truth. Deal with it!  A want of social approval will just lead you to disgrace.  Who would you rather be? John the Baptist, who wasn't liked by many and who got his head cut off BUT lived totally for God and changed a ton of peoples lifes.... or Herod who always tried to please people and ended up lived a miserable life and hurting a lot of people.  It's your choice.  Jesus wasn't liked my many...I wont be liked by many either.
