Wed. we should make a new tradition, but not tallcakes every week(that'd be good though)I know that we have grown closer in light of all that's happened lately. And it is great to have someone to talk to about things on my mind, and things that just *happen*  It's great to have someone that i can call up on a whim, and just hang out with, who loves to be as spontaneous as me, and even if you don't, Thanks for acting like it! And with all the Paul ordeals, i'm glad I can be there for you to talk to about it all. I'm also glad that you'll listen to me when i have things to say as well.  Thanks for being here for me Cassi, and I hope that you'll stick around for a while  I love you -tori
