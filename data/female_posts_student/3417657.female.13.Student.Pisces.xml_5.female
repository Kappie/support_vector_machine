Very mad. well lets see.... bleep(guy) and blank (girl) are whatever u wanna call them now because they aren't in a relationship. And i'm not mad, i'm hurt but in a sense happy. don't ask me.lol i think it's better. because i realized that bleep wasn't the right person 4 me, it's beep(guy). but i like beep but i still like bleep and i wanna loose those feelings 4 bleep (they're almost gone) and i hate 2 say it but they will be there 4 a while.... Confusing? that's what i thought. But u see bleep has these feelings 4 blank that only they can understand. Cuz no1 can understand those feelings right mici?! lol. well that's that. OOOH!! Friday the 4th was the last day of school!! *tears* but somethin happend and i was really happy. i can't say anything cuz i'm not sure who is gonna read this. But it was sad. i was crying. a lot of ppl were. i'm gonna miss some of the 8th graders. *tears* then that same day me, maritza, jesseca, and jenhi went 2 see the hott Harry,Ron and Malfoy in the Prisoner of Azkaban. lol it was good. not the best but hey it's still Harry Potter. The Demetors sucked Harry!!! haha jesseca. OK srry this is sooo long... then the next day.. we went 2 Ash's party!!! That was fun. We were dancing and stuff. people were getting freaky. i'm so suprised ash's parents didn't say n e thing.it was all good. i wanted 2 dance w/beep but he didn't go. And bleep was danced w/blank so yea. So i danced w/Doug. even though he made me mad. lol. But it was fun. then the next day...eh j/k. haha well i'm gonna go. Garrett's on but he's really not talkin. And doug has offically been on for 11 hrs!!! lol and he still hasn't emailed us mici!! hah i wonder what he's doin...he probably left it on.... ok well i promise 2 post more often so they don't have 2 be long like this.
