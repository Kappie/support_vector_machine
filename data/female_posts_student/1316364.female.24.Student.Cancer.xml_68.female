I wonder if there was a way to know what destiny has in store for me would I even want to know. I am reminded of a scene in the movie Big Fish where the main character is telling a story about when he was a little boy. How he walked up to an old lady that was believed to have been a witch. She possessed the power to show you how you were going to die just by looking into her patched eye. The little boy looked into her eye and sure enough saw how he was going to die. I don’t think I would want to know how I was going to die because I would probably waste the rest of my life trying to stop the inevitable, so to speak.   One of my favorite Motto’s (Jesse told me this once and they are words to live by) is “For every reality there are infinite possibilities”. These are words to live by. That goes along the lines of Choose your actions wisely because just one bad thing can throw the entire flow of things off balance. Ever since I have been on Lexapro I have found that the little bad things don’t happen as much any more, as long as I stay on them. I never thought I would actually see the day that I would have to be placed on medication for anxiety. I never realized what types of things I did as a direct effect from my anxiety. I would snap at people, be always worried that something bad was going to happen to Jesse or me, stressed after being around my sisters kids for 5 minutes…. Although I don’t think that last one had anything to do with my anxiety (no offense kids). On top of that my Anxiety also affected my health as well.  I am not too sure where I am going with all of this but I guess I just needed to type it out because it was on my mind. Sometimes that happens to me.  Do you want to know the ironic thing about it all? My New Doctor felt I needed to be on medication once I told him what was going on in my life (re: Jesse’s Deployment, School, Work, Health, etc.) and the deciding factor was The deployment.   I always knew the ARMY was going to drive me mad one day.
