This is the sharpie fan image of the keyboardist. This photo was taken during a quiet moment at the meet and greet. Its obvious no one told him not to sniff his markers. But for the record he really has the marker clipped to his lip or something. He doesnt REALLY sniff markers...or if he does I would have no idea of it, and this picture could in no way provide proof. I just thought this image was fun, and showed a more personal side to the guys...goofy sharpie geeks. Just like many of my friends, and most of the members of various bands I have known. Enjoy this spontaneous moment of boyish fun for what it is and do not by any means abuse this picture or its intent. It's nice to see the "normal" side of people (we all do odd things with pens that include mounting them behind our ears, to chewing the cap to shreds, to clicking them insescently, to clipping them to about anything...) And just remember any ED fans out there...that pen is what he uses to sign your autographs....so if you would rather make something out of my fun piccy than get autographs than that would be your error to make. Oh and I should make the disclaimer that while I enjoy the stage show these guys put on immensly I am not categorically a "fan." I like the roots and concept of country music more than I like most of the results. These guys are well trained and talented musicians, who could succeed in any genre they would choose. I have a hard time calling them strictly country. Since I am not a "fan" these photos are not meant as promotion...more as a study of me and my camera and whatever photographic skills that may or may not be unleashed. With that disclaimer firmly in place: If you are a fan site DO NOT use my photos. This is me, giving you non-permission to copy and paste any photo on this website for any public use whatsoever. Do not post them on your website, or another. Do not email them to your friends. This is my work, my time, my camera, and my right.  Don't make me call my lawyer, I mean he's a good guy and all but he always wants to go have lunch meetings at greasy spoons. And then he takes his gas to court. Ug. So be respectful of the guys and of my art. Or prepare to "Eat at Joe's" with an ex-senator. urlLink
