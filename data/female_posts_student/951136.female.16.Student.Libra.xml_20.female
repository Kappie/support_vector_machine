Angel  by  Dave Matthews Band    I call you up  You pick up  You call my bluff  On the cards of love  You hold to close  Your hands to your chest  I can’t read your eyes  But I confess  It’s lonely far from you  Even when you’re right by me  It’s only why I wait for you  Take my hand yeah   Why do I beg like a child  For your candy  Why do I come after you  Like I do  I love you  Whatever you are I swear  You’ll be my angel  You   I play my cards  Best I can  But I lose my luck  When you’re not here  My darling heart  Won’t you please give in  I may be strong  But I want you back again  When you’re not here  It’s hard to pretend  It’s all alright  Again  When you’re not here love  It’s hard to pretend  It’s all alright ….still   Why do I beg like a child  For your candy  Why do I run after you  Like I do  I love you  Whatever you are I swear  You’ll be my angel  You   Watch the deck  Count your cards  Makes no sense  That I’m always losing  When you’re gone   Why do I beg like a child  For your candy  Why do I run after you  Like I do  I love you  Whatever you are I swear  You’ll be my angel  You  When you’re gone
