I go through the next 30 minutes watching these "normal" folks go through there everyday lives. Well, there almost normal. The only thing that isnt normal, other then the characters hanging from roofs, saving the day or doing whatever else they do, is that there problems are all solved within the allotted. Wouldnt life be great if we could just have our problems solved by the end of the day? But as I began to think about it, I realize life was not meant to be easy. Our problems and the way we handle those difficult situations mold us into the wonderful people that God has allowed us to become. Everyone always wants to find an easy way out. A route where they wont hurt anyones feelings or wont make anyone uncomfortable, or maybe even themselves uncomfortable. Life is meant to be challenging at times. Thats what makes it exciting and an experience of a "lifetime"!  Wow, i feel better.    Keep it real peeps, Keep it really real!  ~*~Anna
