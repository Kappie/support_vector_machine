That's what you can get me as an early birthday present,k??????  Good Oh Yeah!!  I watched half of Hangman's Curse today.  It's kinda... corny.  It's SOOO different from the book!  Elisha is a snob and Eliija is just..... weird.  And Bloom?  Bloom WAS supposed to be nerdy - yet goodlooking, but in the movie, he's just dumb.  Snyder's pretty close to the book, so is Sparks.  And why am I using last names you wonder?  Because I've now decided that I'm British. Oh darn, I have to go to bed.  man.................................
