Most of these new bands that claim to be punk are "harddashcore" mainstream pop singers that are in it for the money, and don't even care about their fans. Also, they got their career handed to them on a silver platter by a little thing called MTV. These bands include: Sum 41, Simple Plan, Billy Talent, Good Charlotte, Avril Lavigne, Yellowcard, and many, many more. The only show I confide in for real punk music (The Punk Show) disappointed me last night as well. Co-hosts for last night were BILLY TALENT!!! WHY GEORGE, WHY???! Some of the music played by other bands on the show was alright, but the fact that he co-hosted them on the PUNK SHOW! The one dude's hair looks like fucking MC Hammer's for fuck sakes! Fucking posers! NYAGH! Hatred! On another note, I believe the only good punk band playing in the Warped Tour this year is Crowned King. And they're Ska-ish punk, but amazing live. If you want to listen to some REAL punk bands, and not some little posers, listen to: Misfits, Rancid, The Distillers, Ramones, Casualties, The Vandals, and Crowned King. These are just a few off the top of my head, mind you, but still REAL PUNK. That is all  So about a week ago my computer crashed, and has been in the shop until today. So now, I have to re-download all of my 200+ songs, which is a painful challenge because KaZaA Lite HATES me. Lots. Almost as much as I hate it. I hate a lot of things. I hate a lot of people too...hmm. Yes. Hate is good, and full of hatred, sanity, and chewy delicious elements like that. And CRAM JAM! Don't ask...  But yeah. Now that I'm semi-calm and don't want to take an axe to the computer (for now), I'm going to go and try to get my songlist back. Later.   -Joebie
