(although it won't reflect in my use of capital letters and proper punctuation. i'm an  e.e. cummings  kind of chick..)   i went four years plus an extra semester. i studied abroad. i went the whole nine yards. plus a few extra.   and it's funny.. it's funny because i'm in so much debt that the amount of money i owe has become unreal.. it's surpassed the point where i understand how much money that  actually is .. i've been in the position where i'm surrounded by big piles of cash.. tens of thousands of dollars.. and it just becomes what it is.. piles of pieces of smelly paper.. it loses all value for those hours i'm counting it..   which is good, i guess.. because if i started thinking about how much money it was.. then i would think about what i could do with all of that money.. (i.e. settling my student loan debts?) and then i could get into lots of trouble.. and spend time in prison..   but. back to my original point. i'm not alone. i'm another twenty-something who's just graduated and i'm not going into a career right away.. in fact, i don't even have a job.. and this is  Normal .. most of the kids that i should've graduated with last june have been out of school for a year and still don't have jobs.. or have everyday jobs like baristas in coffee shops or shit like that..   (which. let me interject - i don't find anything wrong with. i think too many people find fault in people doing jobs like that..)   and. most of these kids are now considering going to graduate school mostly because they think it's their only real choice.. they can't find anything else to do, so they might as well get back into the world of academia.. (definitely a whole 'nother world.. they're strange people..) and some feel that they don't belong in any other place but in that world.. they can't function without it or something close to that.. i'm not sure..   but. i don't have much room to talk. because this fall i'm starting a secondary education first time licensure master's program. which is slightly different than going to graduate school.. what with the definite end, the goal to work for, the excuse:   "i'm going to get my teacher's certification.. it just was merely coincidental that it's a master's program.."   because. for some reason, i don't want to go to Graduate School. i've always said it was something i didn't want to do.. and it's not like i'm going for four years and writing a super dissertation on some topic and getting my PH.D out of it.. so.. it's cheating, sort of..   but. that's where you'll find me now.
