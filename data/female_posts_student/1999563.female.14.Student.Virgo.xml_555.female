I tired to read this book about the "amazing universe" but I got bored out of my socks so I just looked at the sky instead! :)  Lala.  I had a super good lunch today!  I had that squishy mozerella wih basil on top of goooey french bread! YUM!!!   Lala. Its hard to beat my last post..so I will just stop talking. :)
