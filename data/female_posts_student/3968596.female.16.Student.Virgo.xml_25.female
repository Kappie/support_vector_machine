But then I went throught this whole "self-hating->angry->depressing->perky, oh well it happened " phase afterwards. I kind of feel sorry for the poor soul that was with me (my mom). I lost the attitude when we went over to Office Depot to return s/t. A cute sales guy helps us out...hard to stay mad after that. I swear my mom has the ability to read minds. Because I was thinking of Baskins Robins and as we got out to the parking lot she said "don't worry, I treat you to some ice cream." Weird. So, I drowned out any depressing thoughts w/ a nice wafflecone of cherry jubilee that the lady literally doused w/ whipped cream and almonds (::it was too much but mmm...it was yum::).  Anywayz, I started looking at the plus side to this "failed" test with an optimistic light. My consolation was that this test was  way  better than the practice test I took with John the driver instructor. That practice test went......badly, to put it in simpler terms. I mean this time, on the  real  test, I didn't make  any  dangerous manuevers or go in the opposite lane. I think that's a LOT of improvement. I still made a critical error today though. I made a nice right turn...but didn't stop at the RED light before doing it. Oops. And he intervened by telling me "stop." I was decelarating and going to stop! sheesh.   I mean it's not like I hit anything or maimed a pedestrian.    But I'm over it. Better luck next time I guess. I'm re-taking my permit exam this Fri. b/c it expires on Thurs. The receptionist showed disapprovement at my situation but oh well. She should happy that the roads are still considered safe and she doesn't have to fear for her life. Well, yet anywayz...
