With a mix of her "old-school" and "new age" songs, she kept the audience on their feet.  I was blown away by her talent in playing the accoustic and electric guitars to her old songs, such as Material Girl, and was awestruck by her rendition of John Lennon's "Imagine."  I don't think you truly come to appreciate an artist till you've been to one of their live concerts. I saw a side of her that enabled her to connect with her audience, her fans here in Toronto.   It was a great concert all together, the energy, the excitement, the anticipation of what the next song was gonna be and how she'd perform it.
