Well...Despite it being a brand new day, everything's the same. Same fights. Same people. Same house. Same...everything.        Ha, here I sit, in my overlystuffy room, trying to sound deep...I'm not. My real personality is more of that of a complete psycho wanna-be. I don't try to be the way I am. I don't try to be crazy, outgoing to anything. Its just the wayI am. But yet, somehow, It feels fake. It feels like I'm living an imitation life. Something created by media, friends, family, etc. I hate feeling as if, I'm doing something wrong.        Confusion. I hate it. So confused about a lot of things lately. Its been difficult for me, in my own little world lately. Confused about so many things, some of which I don't feel up to talking about at the moment.        Parents. I love them, and they should know that. I don't show my feelings, because I'm never around them, but they should know. Sometimes I think they forget that. Recently, my relationship with my "father" has gone down the drain, so to speak. I have no clue as to what I did, but, like always, its my fault. My 'dad' says its because I'm an irresponsible 15 year old, who does nothing but sit in her room and talk on the computer. Now, this is true...But I hardly consider myself irresponsible. But, that's just me.        Life. I seem to be living two lives. One real, one not so real. The real life is great. I have friends in school, we do stuff outside of school, and they like me for who I am. My not-so-real-one, is on the internet. Message Boards, chat rooms, wherever. But the internet life,I seem to be liking better...Take this one board I go to...Everyone there is like family. I don't feel that in real life. Sure I have close friends, but none to actually conceder my 'family'        Personally. My personal view on myself, is,I should have done some things differently. I should have looked after my body, so I wouldn't risk getting diabetes, like I am currently. I should have lead my own life those 5 years I let people walk all over me. I should have never hurt myself, and made my mother cry. I should have met my real father. I should...I should have done a hell of a lot more then I am now...I should have had ambitions.        ~Phoenix
