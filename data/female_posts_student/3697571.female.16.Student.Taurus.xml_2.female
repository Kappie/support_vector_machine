I never feel good about my self or confident but how can i feel confident when my family is always putting me down..or guys are putting me down. I just dont even know what to do anymore. I find myself almost crying every night..sometimes i have to cry myself to sleep.. i am so lonely in my life.. ive also been slippin in my faith a lot.. ive been cussing and just not acting like a christian.. and it really makes me feel bad! Then me and my mom and my sister , DeAnna have been fighting  a lot. I just sometimes get so mad at them, i want to hit them so i have to go in my room and scream into a pillow or somthin... then no one ever calls me.. mym om is always like wheres all ur friends and im like idk u tell me! Sometimes I just want to get out of Louisiana, i hate this place so much! My mom is talking about moving to Florida but we cant really afford it.. we cant really afford anything now days. Ive been thinking a lot about my friends i never see.. like the people from New Iberia, and New Orleans.. and my family a lot.. I never get to see them and it makes me really upset.. Im ready to justl ive myl ife but it hasnt even started. Ive never had a boyfriend and it makes me really depressed just to think about it. Sometimes I feel like the virgin Mary.. ive never even kissed a guy! I feel like a walking disease or somthing.... its like what do i smell bad is that why ive never had a boyfriend.. or maybe im just picky.. i no im very picky..but if some people went through what i went through.. they wouldnt trust guys either... idk! and im tired of everytime i tell someone how im feeling they tell me all these comments like "o danni ur not ugly ur pretty" blah blah blah and im like thanks but i dont want any complements right now im just tellin you how i feel...and how do i know ur tellin me the truth its not like they would say "im ugly" to my face. but yea thats whats been on my mind lately!
