I am so amazed at how wonderful these children are due in a large part to her wonderful spirit and teaching.  I seriously doubt that these kids could have a more perfect teacher.  Mrs. Noonan is a godsend as well.  I am so blessed to have found that school.  I am going to miss it...if any gets rich please remember me...lol  I want to buy a house in Oceanside so that I can raise my kids there and keep them in that school.  I am seriously sad about Bailey not going to the first grade there.  I really am going to miss everyone there, it is going to be such a change.  A very dramatic change for us...for us St. Mary's was like family.  It is hard to leave family and it is equally hard to find a school that feels like family.  God bless the wonderful people there.  I hope they all continue to prosper and do wonderful things for these children.  The ceremony was so cute.  I cannot tell you all how wonderful the ceremony was and how well practiced the children were.  I was however upset by the comments made by their music teacher.  I hope that after seeing the graduation and after watching the children's faces light up that she feels differently about kindergarten graduations.  If she doesn't, I feel very sorry for her.  Afterwards we went to Denny's, Bailey's choice of course...then it was swimming and sleeping for me...  Greg and Joy came over, but I was knocked out because I had a case of food poisoning and well I had to be upstairs in the room the whole time.  Then we woke up, played games, they went swimming and then we bowled.  I want a rematch when these darn nails are off.  I seriously hurt myself.  UGH  Oh well, it was fun.  I am thinking of taking the kids to the Dr. Seuss thing in San Diego, but am unsure of the date.  Wanted everyone to go, but it doesn't look like it will happen.  Anyway, hope you guys have a nice weekend.
