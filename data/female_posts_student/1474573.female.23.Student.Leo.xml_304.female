Now, it was all over the place that Rupert was America's favorite Survivor EVER.  So why even bother with having a vote?!  I mean, they may as well have handed it to him last week!  EVERYONE knew it'd be him, and rightfully so.  He basically did back-to-back Survivors and made it to the Jury both times...and he's really sweet under the Pirate's facade...  YAY!!  This  ALMOST  makes up for the LaToya loss.
