Here I am, feeling down about my sister and being unproductive and lazy and I just happen to mention in passing that I went to church this morning, and how it is Palm Sunday and all, and I just inspired my roommate to go to an evening service.  She even thanked me for doing so.  And that feels really good, praise be to God.
