No, I'm not going to show it to you guys coz the pic looks so ugly...  Thought I couldn't get online until I sat down and read the instructions carefully. I almost thought I couldn't get online until, like, two days later. That would most certainly have killed me.  The dorm is cool. Thinking about living in it and actually living in it are two totally different things. You guys should come over for lunch or something one day, and I'll show you around... I think all you need to do is sign in as visitors. But the dorm is a long way from the entrance. =.= Like, 20 minutes walk. =P Which is about the same amount of time that my mom needs to get to HKUST from my home by car. --"  By the way, someone fill me up with what happened after I left at Christy's.
