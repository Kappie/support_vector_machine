THANK THE LORD.  He kinda sucked ass bigtime.    Siiigh...so Bill won on the Apprenticeship with Trump.  I was a bit upset that Trump didn't choose Kwame because I felt that unlike Bill, he didnt wear his stress on his sleeve, and, like a good manager, he let his workers do their job without micromanaging.  In the end, I feel that Kwame and Bill should have switched teams.  One wanted micromanaging, the other didn't.  Each team did not cater to the leader's strengths.    Now, in all honesty, I think that a MAJOR deciding factor on Trump's part was the fact that Kwame didn't fire Omarosa.  Problem is, he was under the impression that he COULDN'T!  She blatantly lied to him, he knew it, but felt he had to work with it because he couldn't get rid of her!!  Now, that's just unfair!!    And was it just me, or did it seem at the end when confronted about her lying, Omarosa blatantly admitted to fucking Kwame's shit up because, AND I QUOTE "Mr. Trump, you hired me, then fired me, then hired me again, for no money, only to fire me?"  She had that frustrated look of, "Well, I  KNOW  you didnt expect me to just  accept  that, did you??"  She got straight up petty.  That woman has issues!  And on dateline they showed her hubby, who looks relatively normal, so what gives?!  Now THAT is a BITCH.  I've come to the conclusion that anyone that was a beauty queen has some serious issues.  I mean, you know the young ones are fucked up in the head as adults because their crazy-ass moms (or dads) made them up to look like cupie dolls and prance around a stage like I dont know what!  But the older ones?  What makes a person get into that?  I know many do it to pay for college (like Omarosa) but they've still got to be somewhat shallow and full of themselves, right?  It's got to fuck up their whole life (by crushing their egos) when they dont win enough... therefore they must have to take it out on the rest of the world.  Think about it.  Hence my quote of the day: "Hell hath no fury like a former beauty queen scorned."
