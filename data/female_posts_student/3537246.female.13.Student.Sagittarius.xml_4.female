AAAAAAAH! I'll probably just tell him that I have the notes but I can't find them, He'll probably say okay because he knows im a good kid -smiles big-  I LOVE Avril's song "He wasn't" I'm listening to it now haha "Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone. He wasn't what I wanted, what I've got, no. He wouldn't even open up the door. He never made me feel like I was special. He isn't really what I'm looking for."   Woot total sweetness!!! :P Anyway yep so that's all for this post. Later dudes.
