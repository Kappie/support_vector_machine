If I am a wreck now, what will I be a week from now, a month, tomorrow.  What will I be when I have to say kaddish or yartzeit, what will I be then.  But in reality I think I have become a wreck.  I have spent the last few days looking for a fight, a fight within me just dying to be let out.  Bits of it escape from time to time, always aimed at the wrong person the wrong issue.  Eventually I will explode and I will no longer be a wreck, I will be nothing.
