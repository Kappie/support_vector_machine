It was cool we went out for lunch then she rode her bike to the park and we met her there. Due to the fact she can't walk far distances because of a mortercycle accident 4-5 years ago. The only thing that turned me off of bikes yet she still rides. Oh well... Then came home and called naomi as she had called this morning to see if i wanted to go blading in Stanley park . Went out bladed from the first curve parking lot right after the navel base i think it is. We stopped at the pool and took the kids for a swim(Naomi has a little 5 month girl). I noticed mckayla  a little hot i was really worried later relized she has a bit of a fever:(.A hot lifegaurd complimented on my daughter. It was so nice outside we figure we bladed for 1.5 hours- 2hours. i did all the work as naomi had a running stroller and i had 50 pounds plus in a stroller not immpressed with the weight .Ironically enough 3 min before our destination one of the wheels fell off. I felt very budget. holding the stroller on the front two wheels as it was the back one that fell off killed my back my arms had a workout too. But to no avail i was trying to keep busy because i am extremly horny... now i am just tired and horny.Oh well i guess. Poor andrew i have been tormenting  him:D.So tmw i am going to try and get up for a 6 am run ....hopefully i will make it as i had coffee:( at like 4 or so. i hope i am not up all night. Thankfully enough i rollerbladed in my playboy bikini top to get colour. I hope mckayla is ok and damn do i need relife i have been like this since 1130 yesterday.
