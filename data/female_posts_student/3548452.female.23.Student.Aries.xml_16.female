I somehow dont have his blog on my recent list anymore so I looked it up by the only thing I could remember- tramski. And sure enough, there was the wedding blog. I almost couldnt believe my eyes... so I checked it out. The wedding looks like it's going to be awesome. And then I saw the link for Shimron's blog, so I checked it out for real this time. I hate to be critical of him, so dont think that's what I'm tryin to do. I just noticed a lot of things have changed in him, and I didnt want to comment on it until my best friend saw it too. I'm not alone on this. It's like he's turned into that old man that I hate. Dont get me wrong, there is definitely something about a guy that is settled into his ways, but he seems to be going through the same problems I'm going through- drinking a lot, being confused, dissatisfied with life... But he's working on fixing it and so am I. The only thing I will say is loving someone and being in love with someone definitely are not the same thing. *shrugs* I am just happy that he is doing well and that life is going great so far. Although, unless there's some things I dont know about... there is a big fat lie now that stands in the way of our friendship that I'm not really too happy about, but what can I say? I love him so I'll let it go eventually- probably by the time he gets back from his honeymoon. Last year I told him I wanted to meet the person he was spending the rest of his life with before the wedding- and by summertime he was telling me that they broke up and he was moving to Colorado... okay. Maybe he felt he needed a break from me, but I really think it was for me do discover I needed a break from him. He is my best friend, and I love him dearly, still in love with him (although I'm working on that), but he drains me. I know that I do things I shouldnt, but never when it comes to him. I could tell you some stories that would have you wondering what the fuck he's doing getting married right now, but that stuff is in the past, and maybe he's changed. But at this point and time, I dont know so I cant say. Love is strange. Like the quote says, "dont marry the person you can live with, marry the person you cant live without." Well, I cant live without him, but he's marrying somebody else. I can be happy with the fact that someone loves him the way I do and that he will be taken care of for the rest of his life. I've noticed that he and I, no matter how much we try to not be around each other, no matter what breaks we take from each other- we end up right back on speaking terms, talking on a regular basis. Maybe one day he can be one of the well-wishers at my wedding. :) who knows? All I know is, he is definitely different. Now I guess I can really move on, seeing all the preparations and things they went through to get ready for the wedding. It still really bothers me that he's not comfortable with me asking how his relationship is going, since I tell him all about what I'm doing and who I'm seeing and if he asked to meet my boyfriends Id let him. *shrugs* Maybe he'll grow out of his insecurities, or maybe she doesnt know about me. Who knows? My situation? I havent heard from David yet, but in the meanwhile, I got asked to do some double/blind date in a couple weeks with Tim and Monya and some guy from Toronto. Great. Tonight: Rev. Righttime and the first cousins of funk at the Clubhouse here in Flint! Join us!
