There was *sniffle* boring because no one was online *sheds a tear* so I decided to look at some MMRPG reviews. Searching in vain for a good, free MMRPG I remembered about a game my friend David Woo (a.k.a. Wavid_Doo to you Thereians) called “PristonTale”. I had wanted to start the game long before, but I was unable to, as I was using my dad’s computer and even after that my computer had no Internet hooked up for a while. Anywho, I started playing this game not too long ago and I’m very impressed, although, as explained in the title of this post, the game is very much like Diablo 2, mixed with Lineage 2, anime style. However, the game is amusing and is 100% free! Another good thing about it is there is no  urlLink PKing  by people of your “race”, the group of people you are allied with. There are two different races: Tempskron and Morion. Each race has four different character classes. Tempskron’s character classes are the Mechanician, the Fighter, the Pikeman, and the Archer while Morion’s character classes are the Knight, the Atalana, the Priestess, and the Magician. You can find complete information on these two races and their classes in the beginner guide on the  urlLink PristonTale website .  The controls for the game are quite simple, child’s play…it’s the camera controls that are a bit tricky, even if you use the auto camera lock, which controls your camera automatically so you don’t have to. You’ll find that when you get the camera controls down pat you’ll enjoy the game much more, and you will have an easier time in battle.   Like all games, the difficulty of the monsters grows as you wander further away from your home city. At first, you are attacked by cute little monsters, and then eventually mean, ugly goblins, and so forth, but even the cute monsters can kill you if you’re not paying attention to them. You can find a list of monsters on the main  urlLink PristonTale website  under Guide > Game Info.  All in all, I believe this to be a good game! The screenshots  urlLink [1]   urlLink [2]   urlLink [3]  I have do not do this game justice…as they suck…so if you want to see the game in all it’s glory for yourself, you’ll have to get in game, because even the screenshots on the main website are not sufficient.
