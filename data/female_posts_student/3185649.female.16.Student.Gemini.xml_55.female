It was great. I understood almost everything that happened, as long as they didn't speed up and go super fast.  But there was this girl on my team. We'll call her Jessie. (I like the name Jessie). Anyway, Jessie is a really nice girl, she's very pretty, and she wears all the right clothes and she says all the right things, quite unlike me. There's this boy in Costa Rica named Minor. Minor is practically in love with Jessie. At least, when ever we're down there, or his church sends a group up here, all they do is talk and flirt and hang out together.  Which you are obviously thinking, would be very hard to do if she didn't speak spanish or he didn't speak English. Yeah, that would be it. Jessie speaks Spanish to. I think I'm just as good as her, I just don't really like speaking in Spanish because I don't want to mess up. Totally natural, I mean they don't like speaking English for the same reason.  But Jessie likes to speak Spanish. Or at least, she does it every chance she gets. I used to think she was just showing off. I don't know about that anymore. Maybe she's just like me and she thinks it sounds so much prettier than English. Anyway, everyone always treats her like the expert on Spanish, which bothers me cause I'm just as good but I'm like last choice as a translator.  On the trip I had a really hard time with that. See I went down before my team and everything was going great but it was hard when Jessie came down cause I felt like all the people who had been talking to me were suddenly flocking to her in preference of her company to mine. So I got really jealous. I had a hard time not bad mouthing her and trashing her behind her badk. I did it once and my friend (we'll call him Will) got all mad at me cause he likes Jessie. And we were on a prayer walk and we're supposed to be praying, so guess what he does? He starts praying that God would heal my bitterness towards Jessie. MY BITTERNESS? He had no idea what he was talking about, and he was so doing it just to annoy me.  That's not my point though. See I've been okay for awhile with Jessie speaking good spanish. I think it's because I have a Costa Rican who likes me and he payed attetnion to me and talked to me and said I speak Spanish very well. I think that's all I needed, just a little self esteem booster and now I have more confidence. My point was that Will was writing an email to Minor and he was all 'oh yea it's in English (cause he speaks french) except I signed it "en l'amor de Jesuchristo"' and I was all 'l'amor'?? because if you speak spanish you know that is not a word. And he goes "yea it means in the love of Christ"  Wow. Thank you Captain I'm a Mean Person (but he's being nice now so I can't say anything too bad, because he usually isn't like that). But it kinda hurt and then it totally made me think of Jessie and I was like, 'he wouldn't have said that to her' So then I was in a bad mood for a while.  But I'm doing better now that I've shared that with you all. So if you wouldn't mind praying about that for me though. Cause I'm worried about when the Ticos come up here, I don't want to get all mad and jealous again. You know? Cause that's not who I want to be.
