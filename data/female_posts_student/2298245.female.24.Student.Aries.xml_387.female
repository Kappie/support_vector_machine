But I've absolutely believed it is true for a while, and rewatching  Stir of Echoes  today has only reaffirmed those beliefs and entrenched them more deeply than ever before.  If you haven't seen either movie, you'd be well advised to stop reading now, and go to the video store...  The first time I saw each movie, I had a rather different opinion.  The first time I saw  The Sixth Sense  - I'd been grudgingly dragged to see it by a friend of mine (speaking of which, Christopher Steele, if you ever happen to read this, drop me a line why don't you?) - I thought it was really good.  And I still think it is a fairly well made film.  I just also think that it isn't a movie that stands up very well after two or so viewings.  I'll admit the first time I saw it I didn't figure out the ending.  So the second time I watched it, it was kind of fun to see how the director structured the film so there was just enough information for you to figure it out, yet not enough to make it obvious, or even all that easy to detect for a more savvy filmgoer like myself.   My mother, by the way, figured it out about halfway through.  She sure is one smart lady.  But by the third time I had watched  The Sixth Sense , it annoyed me quite a bit.  Once you know what happens, and you know how its structured, the movie loses all of its fun, all of its appeal.  It's what I like to call a gimmick-film.   Memento  was another one - though it is a slightly better film than  The Sixth Sense  (and I'm not just saying this because I love Guy Pearce).  These films seem to solely exist for the purpose of being clever, and once you've witnessed the cleverness and been taken in by it, subsequent viewings serve only to annoy, and not to provoke thought or even to entertain.    Great art should sustain well, even get better, upon subsequent viewings.  Now, I am not calling  Stir of Echoes  great art.  It is certainly far from a perfect film.  There are things that don't make any sense, and there is not enough development of some of the plot lines.  Still, every time I watch this movie I find myself liking it more.  The first time I watched it, I thought it was OK, but no  Sixth Sense .  But the story and the film, for all its faults, does not fall apart upon subsequent viewings like  The Sixth Sense  does.  So it is for this main reason that I boldly pronounce that it is a better film.  Just so you all know that it isn't just my appreciation for the underappreciated Kevin Bacon that is driving this pronouncement.  There are other things that set it apart, and this is mainly a question of approach to the subject matter.  In  The Sixth Sense , the child must come to terms with the fact that he "sees dead people" and must graduate from the fear that they instill in him to understanding what they want and being able to help them.  In the end, he is nothing but a happy, fairly well-adjusted child who is contentedly coping with his burden.   Stir of Echoes , instead, presents us with a father and son, both of whom see the same ghost.  The father's involvement in the world of spirits is temporary, imposed upon him by a hypnotic episode.  The son's involvement is permanent.  So, after the scene when the father alleviates himself of the burden, by solving the mystery and setting the ghost free, the audience is lulled into believing that this film has a happy ending.  But the film ends on a rather somber, and to me, ultimately more realistic note, as the son sits in the back of his parents' car, listening to the voices of the dead coming at him from all around, unintelligible because of their sheer volume.  And he tries to shut them out, covering his ears with his hands.  This scene alone makes it a better movie.  It's almost  The Sixth Sense  in reverse.  In the beginning, the kid seems perfectly content to be visited by ghosts.  But at the end, it proves to be too much for him, as he hears the overwhelming cacophony of voices calling out for help.    But really, I just like watching  Stir of Echoes  so much more.  And I honestly can't say why...not really.  My attempts to explain it here are vain and not really satisfying, rather like ramming my head into the wall over and over again, something I've been getting really good at lately.  Here's my argument anyway - for what it's worth.
