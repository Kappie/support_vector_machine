I invited him to the TASHA show to watch me, and he did. That show was the official closing of the barn, so I was really depressed and sort of removed myself from him and all other people. He took it as I didn't like him anymore Then a week and a half later when I was coing back around he started acting all, "Let's just be friends." I was devastated. We had arguemnets fro about another week and I cried alot, only to find out that he liked Jordan instead. I was pissed off, didn't talk to him for a few days; then he called me, we went to the mall and saw the movie Paycheck, I felt better. By then he had been going out with Jordan for about 2 days. We went back to school. Jordan dumped him after having gone out for about 6 days. I liked him still, but wasn't going to take him back after what he did. Started to like him again, be more open again, stopped liking him again, came to his house on Friday before Senior High Gather (go here for pictures), and he tried to make out wiht me. I was going to ask him to Sadie as a friend, but he was too horny. Spent the weekend with Ellen, Brian, Michelle, Shannon at church retreat. Fell for Brian. *insert Senior High dance story here*   Yeah that is basically it... I have 3 major stories to tell still, though!
