It is sooo sadd!! =( I just got home from the hospital, and the latest news is ... he has 3 cracked vertebrae, broke ribs, hole in his colon, partially collasped lung (but they put a tube in there to drain the blood). When he got to the hospital, his temperature was 90 degrees, cause he lost soo much blood, but they have gotten it up to about 94-95 degrees now,which is good!, He is on a ventalator to help him breathe so his body won't have to use any energey, except to begin healing!.. He is in Stable, but critial condition. He is having another surgery tomorrow at 12:30! We are all gonna go up there again tomorrow! Keep him and his family in your thoughts and prayers! *^*We Love You So Much Nick!*^* Hang in there!!
