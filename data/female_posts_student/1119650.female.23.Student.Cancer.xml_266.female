Either through running and weights at my  urlLink gym  or my pilates work out I have seriously pulled a muscle in my groin....AND IT REALLY FUCKING HURTS!  I can't wear pants, I can't really walk, I can't sit indian style and stairs are MISERABLE to navigate.   Owies!  (Will someone come massage it for me?)  Furthermore, I finally got around to watching the first episode of the new season of  urlLink Sex and the City  last night.  It was heart wrenching, at least to me, becuase well...Aidian, who in my mind is the perfect man and also represents the one that got away within my own life, is MARRIED and has a BABY.  I thought I was going to puke when I saw it, literally.  It was such a shot to the gut.  Its amazing how a show like that can make you want to slit your wrists because it can so painfully and acurately dredge up all those emotions about failed relationships that you hide from everyone else.  Definitley an A+, very good, girlie show.  2 more days to my birthday!  Yay yay yay!  (I know, I know you're ALL sick of hearing about it, but fear not the insanity will be over shortly!)
