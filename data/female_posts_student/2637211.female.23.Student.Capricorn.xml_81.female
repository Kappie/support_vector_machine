I'm so excited, and we're going for 3 days with park-hopper passes, which means we get to see California Adventure too. Although you may not know it, I'm a complete Disney-freak. I seriously want to go to Disneyworld for my honeymoon. Really. I even know that I want to stay at the Polynesian Resort, and I want to go for the first week of December--this is giving me ideas about what date to set for the wedding whenever Jerm gets a job and I can make plans to settle down and get my MRS.  Shane, Ursula and Hayden (Jerm's best friend and family) will be going too, which I'm not sure about, but we'll see. They can be a little bit picky, which gets on my purposely easy-going nerves. Hmm. They can be a whole lot of fun though, and hopefully Hayden won't be to shy so we can jump into being silly. He's a fun kid when he's comfortable with you.
