It was funny, I got home and my whole house was dark, so I ran up the stairs and my hallway was dark, and so was my room, and I started freaking out. Haha. I ran out to the hall and flicked tbe switch on really fast. Haha, creeeepy. Anyway, I think i'm off to do something productive....or not. Probably not. Eh. Oh well.
