One minute she's ranting about Duncan from Blue (yes did i mention she also has bad taste in men!!) and the next, she's certain that she and some footballer Christiano or sumthing are meant 4 each other.           My friend whom i have been talking to is fickle withr real life guys. Cesca and I have observed the way she flirts like hell with one guy, then loses him as soon as she is sure of his liking her - the thrill seems 2 be in the chase. With my open mind as ever,(again, ha!) I must add, well, each to their own. However, when the "hobby" affects and hurts others, I object.      Anyway enough of my ranting on that topic - I'll rant on another instead!!      Having just returned from the doctor's I am not in such an amazing mood as now at cesca's next week I will have2 take 5 tabletsa day, all @ different times :-( not fun.          ah well better go I'm getting a headache and my fickle "friend" has gone.          Farewell til once again I grow bored...
