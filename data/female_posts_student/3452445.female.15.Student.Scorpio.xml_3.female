Most of us could do a damn decent strip-tease.  We would show off like that for our lover, and her lover is her audience.    the 55 hour marriage- BACK OFF OMG!! how many people go to Vegas and get married for LESS time??  thats what vegas is all about, i would go just to see how many marriages and divorces i could get in one weekend!  i think it must have been a slow celebrity gossip week for them to make such a big deal out of it seriously.  ~ and at least she married someone she KNOWS!    guess what? she has feelings too.  my opinion on her really changed when she said in an interveiw "there is no cool bone in my body" shes self-conscious just like the rest of us.  sure she REALLY has no reason to be but shes human!!!   the national enquirer can kiss my ass first of all, second of all, im guessing the shit they say gets to her.  i heard a few rumors she wanted to have a baby and kill herself in her "everytime?" video, just to give the public what they "want."  i say stay strong brittney!!  question- how does lil kim get away with dressing WAY worse than brittney and yet no one calls her a whore? come on pasties!!! she gets made fun of for being so trashy, but no one says what a skank she really is- does race have something to do with this? dont get me wrong, im not prejudice, im just noticing a fact, but i do think pasties are a wee bit too far, save those for...not the public!
