Happy 15th dude! But yeah I got this major make or break your grade project in biology on the ecosystem. We have been learning this stuff since when...4th grade? Its getting old very fast. Yeah but I have it almost done. Today (Saturday) I had softball practice. We practiced slidding and I screwed up my knee real bad. I can't bend really far and I can't kneel. I hope it gets better soon. But yeah Mel came over today. She went to church with us and when we were saying the creed she put her hand on her heart. I was like dude this isn't the pledge. Good Lord she is a blonde but you gotta love her. I'm super bored. Nothing much to do around this house. All I want to come is June 9th. I'm not even looking forward to my birthday. Wow I'm a loser. Well I have nothing else to say so nighto kiddos.
