To a math teacher it’s doing a simple mathematical calculation wrong. To a thief it’s entering the wrong house and getting caught. To me: it’s basically my life.    I don’t think a day goes by without something embarrassing happening. Sometimes, I’ll admit I get embarrassed at things that are beyond my control: things that aren’t even my fault. Like when actors act out an embarrassing scene on t.v. When someone says something not realizing that who they’re talking about is right behind them. Sometimes I get embarrassed to tell the waitress that she actually picked up my fork when she picked up the plate, and so I don’t have a fork anymore.   Getting embarrassed when you find out that your big sister actually did something that seems more like a scene from a movie, only she did it live, is pretty normal -when she tells you how she picked up the microphone at this place, not realizing it was actually on, and was singing in front of everyone “Right here waiting for you.” It’s okay to get embarrassed for her and envious. It’s okay to be proud that the people said she had a good voice.   Getting embarrassed that you embarrassed your teacher is okay too. Like when my teacher was saying how he never learned things fast, but once he learned them, he never let them go. And to prove this, he started to name Jupiter’s moons, only he added Titan, and so you raised your hand up in front of the class, and corrected him, telling him Titan is actually Saturn’s moon. Of course, he agreed with you right away and corrected himself, but it’s okay to be embarrassed that you put him in that position and that your class was staring at you as if you had just grown another nose. Well, why not? You just proved to them, for the umpteenth time, what a geek you were. (Notice: Please notice the verb: were. Were is the past tense. It means it happened in the past; I was a geek in the past.  Right? Right?! This is so embarrassing: why isn’t anyone agreeing with me?!)  Getting embarrassed is annoying. People say, why are you embarrassed? There’s nothing to be embarrassed about, but of course there’s always something to be embarrassed about…especially in my life…  But you know, the good thing is, I’m over being embarrassed about my last name. It’s not that I was really embarrassed. It’s just that, everyone always had to make a big deal about. “Banawan,” that’s quite an unusual last name.. “Banawan? That’s your last name? Where are you originally from?” Like who the heck cares where I’m from. What are you going to go talk to my great ancestors about my last name? PleaZZZZe—get a life!     	 Actually once, I told my friend that we were actually Chinese. I then pronounced my name, in such a way, that she believed me I said, “ Bana –wAn”. It was really funny. It turned out anyways, that I had relatives living in the Philippines…to all you Banawans out there, that I don’t know, I love you guys :D   Anyways, I couldn’t really be embarrassed. There was a t.v. show practically dedicated to our last name. It was called “Camp Banawana.” I swear, there was a t.v. show called that. The only problem is no one seems to have heard of it, or seen an episode of it. That’s my homework assignment for you guys. Go look it up….believe me, it exists! And I used to like it too…well why not? It practically had my last name.    You know back to the topic of embarrassment: when you realize that all this time you’ve been singing on the bus, thinking that the girl behind you doesn’t really talk, and she won’t mind, then seeing her SINGING on the graduation, is a time for embarrassment. But, anyways that girl left the school, so phew, things are okay. No one’s going to find out the truth about our voices.  Speaking of which, my math teacher makes fun of my voice. It’s because I have a low voice (not very girly) and because I have an American accent. He seems to find it very funny, but at the same time irritating. Anyways, I’m always making fun of him/and he makes fun of me, so that’s okay. Only I have this dream: I want to work for a news station. Read the news everyday, in that fake voice they have. (I tried it with my friend once and she said I did have the right voice.) Be all smiley everyday, reading the news. Then one day, for just one second, I’ll say, “And my voice is now famous…take that mr. former math teacher.” And then I’ll just continue on reading the news as if I hadn’t said anything weird.   You know, I once saw this woman on the news station go like “I forgot all my lines. Sorry,”! It was actually quite humorous: and now that I think about it, quite embarrassing.  I wonder if she ever had a teacher that made fun of her voice….  I have dreams of going back to all those bullies that used to bully, young, quite me…Is that normal? Hehe, having dreams where you go and take revenge against a kid that teased you/ bullied you when you were in kindergarten? Well, who cares if it’s normal…., let me let you in on a little secret: I’m not aiming for normalcy, you see :O Yup, my life is gonna be different. Not that it hasn’t been already, but well…  Anyways, I see my twinster has been discussing bad habits. Let me tell you what  a really really annoying habit is. When someone goes on and on about nothing. Keeps on talking and talking and you just want them to shut up. You feel like saying, “ Hey, I don’t need to catch a train. I actually need to stand in front of a train so I can die…It would be less painful than listening to you go on and on.” Or you just want to tell the person that you have discovered they have exactly 34 freckles on their face, seventeen eyelashes on one side, a thicker eye-brow on the other, and that they are in desperate need of plastic surgery. You realized that because well, why they were so nicely discussing what their mother told them when they were 6 years old, you happened to have time to glance at their face. (Of course, you don’t actually tell them this, or that fact that you were staring at their face, dreaming of ways to kill them and that you figured out 4 so far.) Nope, you just sit down, and listen to them talk and talk. I hate those people.   Anyways, I figure I talked a bit. Not enough for you? What you say you want more of my wisdom? Sorry you’ll have to wait until next time!  Byebyez!
