Sorry if i disagree but boy bands, Britney Spears, the Macarena and the Spice Girls may have rocked for their 15 minutes of fame but they're done. Sorry, but Britney Spears is still not cool. A certain junior we lovingly refer to as Anna Nicole, Britney Spears is a loser. Another person who has had their 15 minutes and is done....Avril LaVigne. Bye bye Avril. Get your nasty faux skater girl butt right back to Canada. For the love of god you can't even spell boy! Lesson 1: Boy not boi Not that difficult Avril. Go back to Canada and maybe we'll let you come back when you've written some decent lyrics.
