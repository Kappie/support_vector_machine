Erik was with me at the time, cuz his family was out of town and he had helped out w/ the races, which by the way raised over 700 dollars from my guild for children's hospital.... anyway.... so the park was really crowded, and i couldn't find Brett anywhere when i got there, so I was a little frustrated, meanwhile, the whole time Erik was making fun of me because I like Brett. So anywho, i tried calling him, and he never picked up, so I ended up just watching the fireworks with Erik and his friends.   When I got back to my car, I had a message on my phone- Brett. He had called to tell me where he'd be, and sounded all disapointed. He said, "So.... I hope i get to see you tonight..." and then I felt so bad, cuz I could tell that he really was looking foreward to hanging out w/ me. I told Erik that, and he just said,"Oh my God Ali! He likes you." and I said, "Yeah, i know, and I like him, but he 'doesn't date'". That's when I think Erik realized that it was more than just a crush or something, and he stopped teasing me.   So, I headed on back to Brett's house, so he'd know that I hadn't just not come, but that I couldn't find him. You should've seen his face when he saw me at the door. We hadn't even talked to eachother in almost 3 weeks, so it was great to see him agian. Erik had said he wanted to stay in the car, so I was talking to Brett, while erik was doin whatever in my car, and then I realized that i'd been in there for more than half an hour. I said I needed to get going, so Brett started to walk me to my car. It was nice, cuz it was the first time we'd been alone (his parents were inside). He started to get a llittle close to me, and then Erik stuck his head out the window, and screamed, "COME ON ALI, LETS GO BLOW UP STUFF!" Well, of course, then Brett stepped back about five feet, and said i should probably get going. I could tell he was thinking, "oh, she's with  Erik"  I didn't know what to say, but i was just thinking it's not like that, i swear! I was soooo mad at Erik. But, i can't really blame him, I did leave him in the car for forty minutes. However, i was very frustrated, now i don't know if i'll even see him for the rest of the summer, but i'll certainly hope i do.   -Ali
