My grand children, far in the future when they have only seen paper texts in museums, when cars are solar and everything is idealic in a futuristic kind of way, will find my journals in a chest in an attic and be amazed by my writing.  It will be like communicating my most intimate thoughts with a friend who hasn’t been born on our all too linear time line.  But, for the most part, the immediate gratification that I get out of it is being able to think about my life.  I need to externalize.  I need to communicate to think.  How would I do that if I had something that I couldn’t talk to people about but couldn’t write?  I’d be in trouble.  I would quickly turn into a bag lady who talks to everyone while gathering strange shinny street things.  So I write and process, and am left with a record of thoughts, needs, desires, petty little parts of my life, a time-line that a faulty memory does not always hang onto. I occasionally go back to my old journals and review them, leaving me with a better sense of what may have gone into my own narrative to create me.    Blogging is very similar in some ways.  There are times that I read back to what I was thinking that moment, that day, that hour.  I can trace this semester.  Blogs create a chronological record of our lives.  In this way, Laurie McNiell points out, blogs mirror back the traditional journal genre.  There is a bite sized piece of our lives, snippets that we recreate for an anonymous reader.  McNiell also draws parallels in some blogs content compared to the normal diary.  We are writing about our experience for the most part. We are recounting little pieces of the narrative, and not much more.  Some people, like I referred to in my history section, utilize blogs for political action.  Others blogs that we have visited in class are given over to things like pets or cars or the like.  But aren’t these really the same thing?  We are writing about what is important to our lives, parts of us that are important to who we are.  We can only assume that the person who is writing daily news pieces that are out of the mainstream news thinks that’s an important part of their life and who they are. Unlike web pages, that may or may not have anything to do with the creator, blogs are designed to be personal reflections of us.    In some people’s opinions blogs and journals are both a narcissistic waste of time.  There you go.  That’s a similarity too.  Outside class one day I am talking to a fellow student who says, “I think that its just talking to yourself, getting up on your own soap box.  Its narcissistic to think that anybody cares.”  Point.  Point.  Maybe it  is  a little self involved like that.  At the same time though, what makes anyone think that they have any authority?  Really.  If we cant make a claim to know about our own lives and choose to write about them, then what can we claim to know about?  Both blogs and journals are expressions of the self, expressions of our knowledge of ourselves and our story.  They are a way of processing and creating.  They both have the stigma though, so we have to say that its something that they have in common.  So these are some of the similarities between the blog and the traditional journal, but this is where the similarities stop.  I am going to go into more detail in another section of this blog about the blog audience, but I wanted to reiterate that it exists.  While I have an audience vaguely in mind for my journal writing, the way I have tried to write is as if I will be dead when its being read by others.  Honestly, I have tried to be as truthful and frank in that journal as one can hope to be.  I want those future readers to have a sense of who I am in all levels.  On blogs its a little different, and while what I am writing about is honest, its just not the whole of it.  Its not every awkward moment, not every painful situation, not every sexy escapade.  I write about these events, but knowing that I will have to likely face my readers the next day, well, that’s going to but a bit of a boundary on the process.    Blogs can be altered without any knowledge of the reader.  I am doing it right now in fact.  You wouldnt know it once you look at my online journal, this essay in many parts.  There will be no sign that this paragraph didnt exist when this post was first published, but I am in fact adding it about three hours later.   When we are writing in a journal on paper there is no way to do this to your reader- there are ways you can tell there are missing pages.  There are little paper bits showing where there were once words.  Not so here.  This is a fluid medium, and as the author, I can change it at will.  A great example of this is the  urlLink gravity and gun  web journal (warning: this link may no longer exist.  Its that fluid).  Follow it and you will find it changing all the time, comments being moved, deleted, works reappearing.  It makes you wonder what is real and perminant in this new reality of the online, and it may take away a bit of the authority of the author.  However, we also get back our authority through that same speed and flexiblity.   Audience is one way that the medium is different.  Another is the way is that this is instantly publishing.  I can write about anything, make it as short and as long as I want, and then there it is.  Obviously this just doesn’t happen with the in-your-room-on-the-floor-next-to-your-bed type of journal.  At least, I hope that it doesn’t happen.  At any rate, we don’t write as if it is happening.  This instant publishing means that you can be reading about an emotion or thought process only moments after the author had it.  For example, in my may 5th post I opened the blog with, “ urlLink So a few beers later…oh, right.  I forgot the beginning of that.  I’m still a few beers in… so I suppose that works .” This was at 7:28 according to my little clock on the post.  If you had called at 8pm that night, after I had posted, its likely that I would still have been inebriated.  This is now, or the next day, or the next week.  This is not forty years between the emotion and the context- this is now.  This is the case with all blogs.  On Blogger there is a section of blogs called “Recently Updated.”  In this section I can find the up to the second blogs.  For example, its currently 4:10pm and on Islas en La Red the first and most recent line is, “ urlLink Trasteando con los enlaces del mensaje anterior, me encontré con la web de Ferrán Fernández, uno de los autores que participa en la exposición "Poesía Visual y libros de artista", que se encuentra abierta en la Sala de Arte Murnó, en el marco de las actividades de La Laguna en Poesía 2004.”    I have no idea what this means, however, this person just wrote it.  Everything here about (I think) encountering a website about Ferran Fernandez, one of the people that participated in the exposition about something, well, this person who made this blog just encountered that. Blogs are like small windows that stretch around the world into other people’s lives, and those windows are open to moments ago, the recent past.    In my blog I write about memories, experiences, and thoughts.  But many of them open with something to the tune of, “Well, I’m sitting here at the window looking out at the world,” or, “I’m here in the computer lab and…” There you go, up to date thought process, and I often don’t look at them or edit much.  You can tell because of the vast amount of errors in my text.  I don’t even second-guess what it is I’m writing most of the time; I’m just giving it to you.    A journal is private (and this has to do with audience still, but is slightly different) and a blog is public.  Well, a blog can be public, though you can make it so no one else can read it, what’s the point then?  So a blog is a public space.  No, not quite.  A blogger is intimate because we (the reader) don’t really know who you are.  Even though you claim to be such and such from blank blank, we have no way to confirm that.  Indeed, you don’t even have to make any identity for yourself other then your words.  In that way, the blog is private.  The blog is like the living room of the internet- often you have your clothes on, sometimes you don’t, often you are being honest, sometimes you're not.  Anyone could come into your living room, but normally they have to know where you live, and how to get there.  A really popular blog must be like having a house party all the time.  A blog is a space that is less private then your own head, but a lot less public then the park.  A blog is in the middle; it is a place that we can rarely find in real life to try out parts of ourselves.  A blog is a safe place WITH other people.  I feel that I am a fairly confident person, and fairly open about who I am.  However, with the blog I can tell people about myself in ways that I can't in a person to person conversation.  I can do a long monologue, really, expressing myself in one semi-fluid rant.  This allows me to tell people about me without being a crazy girl in person.  This lets them think about and read about me without me staring at them.  We are creating a place that is public/ private, and virtual/real.  A blog is a new twist.
