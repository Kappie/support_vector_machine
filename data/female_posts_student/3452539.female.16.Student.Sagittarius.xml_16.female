It was not as easy as the first half as I had expected, but it could have been worse.   Left school, got brunch with my mom, and as we pulled in so did Robbie. After getting gas, caffeine, directions, and a new windshield wiper, we were off. I was ecstatic! We were on the Mass Pike, and I was counting down the miles until Boston. Then, Robbie got a very concerned look upon his face. He could not move the shifter. The clutch probably blew. We were stuck in the middle of the pike, I think a ways out of Palmer.   Got towed back to Enfield, CT. Got taken out to lunch by Robbie's rents. Then, they gave me another surprise, which I have reiterated like four times now lol. It lifted my mood immensely, but it is still low. I have that headache that I used to have when I worried excessively.   Am IM that I also just received helped immensely. Listening to DKM too.   I was so close.   Now some of my friends have had a bad day also and wish to take a walk to unwind...and I am not even in the mood for that. I just feel ill.   Very physically ill. My dad is starting to think that I have blood sugar problems and need to see a doctor. Crap.   Well, I am going to go, and remember, Tycho, don't give up on me ...
