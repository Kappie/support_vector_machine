Here are some main points of rage for me:  1. the author (who refuses to admit who he/she is hmm.) says that bush should be loyal to his friends in making sure that he was listening to them. Um did I miss something. 'Cause last time I check the president's job was to protect the rights of the citizens of the united states. ALL of the citizens. Including gay and lesbian citizens.  2. defending traditional marriage? WHAT?! first of all how does that make sense AT ALL. How is giving gay and lesbian people the right to be married destroying any hetero marriages. Um, gay people being married is NOT going to affect the ligitmacy of a straight marriage. If the author means that gays being allowed to marry is going to taint traditional marriage well there is something SEVERELY wrong with that in itself.  3. Bush's christian beliefs should have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with making a fucking AMENDMENT in the constitution. What happened to religious freedom. Yeah remember that?! This is NOT a theocracy! Bush's own personal morals should have nothing to do with his law making decisions. Laws and amendments are meant to PROTECT the rights of the citizens, not take them away. They are made for the good of the citizens based on what is beneficial for them. NOT how Bush or the Christian thinks it SHOULD be.   There is  a lot  more I want to comment on but if I make it too long no one will read it. Hell you guys probably won't read it now as long as it is. To be honest, I wouldn't.
