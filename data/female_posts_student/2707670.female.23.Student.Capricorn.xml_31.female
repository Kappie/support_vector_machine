The farther into the semester the less I feel like doing. Unfortunately my professors don't really understand how I feel and therefore make more work and more tests. I however have been having a great week for putting off work. I had a test and homework due both on Thursday and they have both been put back to next week which is great for me today but really bad for me next week because you know that I'm not going to start studying until I have to. This just adds to next week's work but rather than trying to get things done early I am enjoying the free time that was added to my week this week and I will have to work doublely hard next week. Oh well you do what you have to when you have to.   Michelle, I am glad you are home but I am with you on not being back spirtitually.
