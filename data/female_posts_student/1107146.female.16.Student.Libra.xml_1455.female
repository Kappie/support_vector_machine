Life sucks even more than it did before.  Not only is my dad being bastardly, *takes deep breath to prepare for spilling guts and also preparing (hopefully) for sympathy* my cousin Gael just found out that she has cancer.  Badly.  I mean, monster.  She's smoked for a while but it started as skin cancer, we think, and spread.  Technically it's called "carcinoma without principle cause."  Which means that it's cancer that the doctors don't know how she contracted.  And she's taking chemo.   And I didn't know until TODAY.  And I'll give you two guesses as to which parent told me.  Yeah.  On the way back from lunch, my dad tells me in this fucking patronizing voice and makes me cry, making my mascara go EVERYWHERE.  And it just sucked, so when I got home, I practically jumped out of his car with barely a goodbye and ran into the house, where I just broke down.  I WON'T BREAK DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM.  NEVER AGAIN.  So, as I'm sure you can tell, today sucked.  Yes, I have been busy, but if I might ask, why hasn't anyone called?  No one ever calls me, I have to do all the calling.  I'd really appreciate a phone call every now and then.  Not too much to ask for the girl whose mental state is even more questionable than it was to begin with, is it?  Sorry if I'm antagonistic or just plain rude, but I've had the worst day I've had in a long time.  And I knew about Linds's mom.  Linds called me from the hospital that day.  I also talked to her mom the other day and she sounded good and she said she felt better, so kudos to Mrs. Reid!  Thanks for being concerned and everything.  Please, someone, e-mail or call me.  I'm actually begging here...and if I may ask, what's the deal with the Greek thing?  I didn't go very far back before I wrote this.  Anyway, see ya.  ~Z
