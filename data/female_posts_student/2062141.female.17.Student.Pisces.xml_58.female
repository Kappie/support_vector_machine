He's so good live!  But anyways... my dad got his new car today. I think it's a Honda Accord. It's real nice, ruby red, with a *gasp* 6 cd changer, satellite radio, and leather seats (no, he's never gonna let me drive it). lol. I'm mad though cause his old falling apart car gets MY space now (?) and I have to park behind mom's garage, meaning that i have to be constantly moving it whenever she goes somewhere in her car. >:(  It'll take forever to sell Dad's old piece of junk. Oh well... but the more important subjects... It SNOWED last night. And this morning. I was up for like 40 minutes before my mom said "oh I'll take you to school today since your car is covered in snow" ....i was like WAAAA.. so weird. It was all slushy and snowy and cloudy.. it was so nice. I love getting all bundled up for the cold. It seemed to start sticking to the pavement (surprising cause it was so wet) but ... much to my dismay, by fourth period it was pretty much gone... :( but it's supposed to do the same thing tonight. It's very depressing...there are all these new Michael Jackson allegations... I don't know what to think anymore. I mean, I'm not as obsessed with him as I was a few years ago, but I mean I still love him to pieces but I really don't know what to think. If his parents didn't mess him up so bad... then things would have turned out much differently. I think I'll just resolve to say that no matter the outcome, that I was always respect his massive talent. Still, it makes me really sad. But then as I was driving to drama rehearsal i was listening to my new CD and it just made me feel so happy... it's so pretty and chill, it was perfect.   ...I drove past a little boy forming snowballs from the tiny snow patches in his yard.    urlLink NATALIE   urlLink IS   urlLink A   urlLink DORK   Bright Eyes Jason Mraz  Bright lights, big city Was quite extraordinary. The drive was pretty. I was in perfect company. The love of a lifetime, Since we were elementary friends; The one with the bright eyes...Â   Why can't I be optimistic? I tried to find the logic logically. I had a dream and I could not shake it. I was standing up there naked. There's fear in the truth at hand, frozen I forgot to understand The live keep living; growing older more into a man... And I let her grow away from me.  Love... love is not pretending. Time... time was meant for mending Memories into all is satisfactory, Healthy smiles fill the page the day we spent in miles. And I let her drive away from me. The one with the bright eyes  Laughed her way inside this music box; Stored away in the corner of my heart. And I let her get away from me. But I'll never take that day away from me.
