Yup...today is more like one of those 'I-think-I'll-just-lay-around-procrastinating-and-watch-tv-till-dinner' days.   Alrighty....voting time. Raise your hand if you're worried about exams!   Yes....I see your hand way back there. I share your apprehensions friend, I do. Especially in the area of choir. I just stopped listening to Mr. Lawton. And when I decided I would be a good student and pay attention, I discovered his voice sounded like the teacher's on Charlie Brown. WA-wa-wa-WAAA-wa  *sigh* I am so lazy.   No, I don't think you even comprehend how incredibly  sluggish Katherine DeVoursney is. An example: last night, I got all snuggly in my bed, ready to go to sleep, and then I realized my room light was still on. Being the resourceful chick I am, I grabbed my stuffed kitty, and attempted to somehow launch the sucker (note: I said STUFFED) at the light switch. Did I really think that by some miracle my GENIUS plan would actually work?  Hell ya I did. Did it really? Hmmm...lets see here...since I sat in my well-lighted bed, in my well-lighted room for like 20 more minutes....I'd say... NOPE. Get the gist? I knew you would.  You are so smart that way.
