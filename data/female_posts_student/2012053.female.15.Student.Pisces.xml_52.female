"As of now, I've received no offers besides just singing at weddings and other local events," he said.  Stevens, 16, looked slightly embarrassed as Williamsville East High School principal Neal Miller declared Friday "John Stevens Day" in front of 1,000 students at an assembly.  "Sing us a song, Johnny!" a few students shouted.   He smiled but didn't oblige.  Since being voted off the Fox television talent show about two weeks ago, the lanky teenager has crooned with Regis Philbin, bantered with David Letterman and come face-to-face with look-alike Conan O'Brien.
