I partly look forward to it, and I partly don't want to go.  Oh, well... what can ya do?  Anyhow, I'll have training sessions this week and next, and then the week of the 18th is when school starts for the kiddies... so that's when I'll be starting work.  Lucky me... I get to drive ALL THE WAY out 1604 to Bandera Rd. JUST for work for a whole week... what fun.  :-\  Oh well... at least I'm getting paid a fairly good amount of money (at least in comparison to my last childcare job).  Okay, well... off I go.  I have to go talk to Will and sign a couple papers before training today... and I need to grab some lunch as well.  Other than that... I'm still confused about lots of stuff... but, hopefully it'll pass.... I'll post something later....
