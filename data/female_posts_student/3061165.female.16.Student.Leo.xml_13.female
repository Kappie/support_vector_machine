The 2 topics were about discussing students going to Polytechnic instead of JC... and students complaining that they have too much remedials given during the holidays. Well, it was a pretty sick day for me yesterday because I ran 2.4km during PE(passed!) n made me feel unwell after tat. I tink it's because I did not eat anything in de morning and during recess I only had de watermelon sago. But before the oral i had prawn noodles(though with no much appetite) n a panadol after tat. I went to bed early yesterday because I was really exhausted so... ZzZzzz..............  This morning I continued on the fourth book(still). I only read it when im bored so im going at a snail's pace in reading the book. Well anyway, finally finished the whole book! Harry Potter stories are really nice! However, why is it that there MUST be a twist at de ending bout someone good is actually a villian? The fourth book was the best amoung the others to me(besides the 5th which i heaven touch on yet). Especially the TriWizard Tournament. It was really fantastic, about the 3 tests(though the second one sucked) and the 3 schools etc... Looking forward to see how the 4th movie will be like! Haha, so many things to show... I bet even 3 hours isn't enough! Well then.. Going to have lunch now.. So maybe later den continue updating..  maybe ... ^^
