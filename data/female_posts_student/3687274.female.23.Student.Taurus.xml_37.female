I called JD Byrider to see if the machanic (Kevin) had spoken to anyone in the office about a payment plan and he laughed and said no. I laughed a little too, it was 8'30am. I'm desparate. Still not desparate enough to whore, but desparate enough to joke about whoring. I really like using whore as a verb. And funner as an adjective. It's funny stuffin'. Anyway...He hadn't spoken to anyone because they weren't in the office yet. So, I told him that I've been calling places and pricing (trying to) used engines and the last place I talked to told me thathe'd need the 8th digit of the vin and the date of something or another. My reason for calling Kevin. He said well, I've been doing the same. I said okay. Then silence. Then he said something else. Then silence. You see, I was waiting for him to say ok, here are the vin and date. He said nothing. So I said hey, can I have the vin and date? He said hang on a sec. Then he gave me the vin and said he didn't have the date. I said well the guy said he needs the date and it's some where on the door and he said...it's funny... he said, 'I don't have it.' I said okay bye.Of all the times I'vebeen in my car I've never noticed that date, why would he? Maybe it wasn't there.... So, I called the guy at the place about the engine and gave him the info and he said well we really need that date and I said Kevin told me he didn't have it. And the other guy said 'all he had to do was open the damn door.' So, I told him I'd go there myself and call him back. The other guy was a nice guy, he still gave me a price range 500-600. That doesn't help. I was a little angry that Kevin didn't give me the date. I didn't think he was shady, until now. This is why I hate people. But what to do?   I need a cigarette. I need a new job. I need a new life. I need a new car.   Tam's mom was talking to me this morning about how stupid I was for always jumping in to things. Not her exact words, but the basic jist. I'm sure I needed to hear that, just not today. Then I mentioned that I'd just sell my bed and tv. And Tam's mom said you won't get much for it. Again, was probably the truth, just didn't need to hear it today.   So, I'm done. I don't care anymore. I'm going to pay my bills. I'll get the fucking careventually. If I have to quit school for the semester then I will. Not like I've never dropped out of school before. :D But, I'm so tired of this shit. So tired.   And Nikol I work today thru next wednesday. I have a four day thur thru sunday and the girls and I were going to hang outnext weekend, I think, for Robin's birthday. Not sure what we're doing yet, butif you're up for it and could find a babysitter,it'd be great if you could hang too. You have to meet all the girls and hang out with us all eventually. Can I persuade you with alcohol??? C'mon, you know you want to. C'mon. Well, I'll call you tonightafter 8 to see.
