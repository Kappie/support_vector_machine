Furthermore, don't think I'm not gonna call you out for being a scumbag and a pussy.  Why don't you try and get custody of your fucking pigfaced child before you try and lure another potential wife into the mix who will probably just leave you because of your "temper" like the first one.   If you have to beat a girl to feel better about yourself, espeically a girl you supposedly love, you're not a man, not even being able to bench 295 lbs. can make you more manly.    If you put your hands on me again or even so much as look at me the wrong way, I will blow up your spot, and you  WILL  go to jail.  I already sent one guy there, so believe me I'm not scared of you, especially since the only emotion I'm tied to you by is hate.  You make me sick.  Go steal some more money from my friend and put it up your nose you disgusting piece of shit!  On the  happier  side of this weekend.  I have the best mommy and friends in the universe.  Thank you to  urlLink Tazz    urlLink Anna  for helping me realize I'm doing the right thing here.  You guys are  too  good to me (c:  My mom and I went all over the place this weekend: awesome Super Stop  Shop, Stew Leonards, Walmart, manicures  pedicures and a lunchy all to ourselves.
