Sports Update: Coppell beats Marcus 5-2!!!!!  rock on, but for awhile there it was a close game.  Marcus was doing well, they were really playing hard and utilizing good defense.....it was tied for about a period....then we scored 3 goals and it was over.  It was fun!  My feet turned purple from the cold...i wore sandals, but i honestly don't feel the cold anymore.  Deines (from Marcus) didn't do anything funny tonight such as banging on the glass of the penalty box.  Dallas plays Edmonton tomorrow night at freaking 9pm!!  Watch that game, its bound to be full of awesome stuff.  We're one point from overtaking San Jose, pray that Detroit beats them tonight!   Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
