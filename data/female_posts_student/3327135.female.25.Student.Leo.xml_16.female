The show (especially, Flora) is so nice that I have to watch all immediately so I went to rent all of the DVD. Tonight, after watching Spider-Man 2, I will go home quickly to watch ATOL. :P  Hehe.. I went to Popular bookstore to buy something just now and it so happened that I saw some inspirational bookmarks there. Hehehe.. So I bought two; one for myself and the other for my roommate.
