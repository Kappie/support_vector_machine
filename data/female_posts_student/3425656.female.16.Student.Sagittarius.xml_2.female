I am not the type that lays out or swims.....i'm just not a girly girl like that, but my boyfriend picks on my white legs, and i realize....they are pretty white. so...i need to tan up some. ahh im burning. oh well. tonight was my last softball game of the city season, and in 2 weeks i have softball camp for Highschool ball that starts in the fall. Varsity here i come! yall better watch out for me! my boyfriend is playing summer ball also, so me and him are both going to be really busy this summer, but we will make time for each other! well im leaving now cuz my fingers are cramping. ttyl byebye
