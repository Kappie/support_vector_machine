While going over my little Dear John email fiasco with her last night, I asked her again, "But you didnt even ask me WHY I was 'breaking up' with you.  Why not ask why, since it came outta nowhere? Didn't you care about and respect the friendship enough to wonder why?"  And she said,  so simply , "Well, don't you think that if  you  cared and respected what we had, you wouldn't be ending it?  I had no place to ask 'why' since you obviously gave it enough thought for the both of us."  That fuckin' girl gets me every time, man!  Busts out with something that makes so much sense, while I sit here analyzing shit for days!    On another note, I was used as an example in my Spanish class.  A POSITIVE example, thankyouverymoosh!  I got a B (an 80) on the last test and I'm doing well on class participation (i.e. yelling out the CORRECT answers to her questions).  Profesora was getting peeved with the native speakers in the class that are not doing well AT ALL and she pointed out that I have brought my grade up from like, a D to a B and I'm not even a native speaker.  Of course she thought I was white, because of the last name and my fucked up accent... but that's not the point.  I'm NOT a native speaker and I'm kicking ASS, yo!!  Go meeeee!!
