Phy Ed  - we'll probably weightlift so see there is no point to going to school tomorrow. moving on...i did learn something today though...i learned how to use some of the weightlifting equip. today. i cant lift very much but at least i can do it. i can lift anywhere between 50 and 80 for my arms. 80 is pushing it though and my legs i think anywhere between 30 and 60. lets talk about lunch...guys are  asses  especially the ones who sit w/ sarah and i. we do not have to take any of that crap! today really got to me and for the first time it was also directed toward me and i listened and it really hurt me. normally they just make fun of sarah and say really cruel things and laugh in her face and i always told her to not let it get to her but today it got to me. i really dont understand why they needed to rag on us i mean we didnt do anything to deserve what they said to us.  band...i needed to go to a mental institution  only for today during that period. too much  flute  this and that! ahhh! i wish school would just be done w/!
