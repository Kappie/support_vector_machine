So after skimming the newspaper headlines, I go out and sit in the minivan to wait for the bus and finish the last little bit of my homework.  6:23 AM- I climb onto the big, bumpy, rickety schoolbus, where I am trapped for the next 35 minutes. I despise the bus.   6:58 AM- I arrive at school, stand outside till the bell rings at 7, and head down to my locker. Since most people are coming out of the gym, where you are really supposed to go before 1st bell, I have to fight my way through the traffic to get back there for PE.  7:30 AM- My PE teacher is out, so we get one of the baseball coaches for a sub. Usally subs are okay, but this guy gets on my nerves. Most of the girls think he's really hot, but I think he's annoying, and that he flirts with highschool girls way too much. Luckily, he's distracted most of the period, so some of the girls who were closest to the television fast-forwarded through some of the Tae-Bo video. I would have fast-forwarded a lot more, but I was in the back. Oh well. Atleast we didn't have to do Richard Simmons today.  After we finished the video and our ab work, I tried to play badminton. It was pretty hilarious. I couldn't even serve the birdie. I have to be the most un-coordinated person I know.  8:53 AM- I head on to 2nd block. Today I made all the effort I could not to answer all the questions that I was able to, becuase I always feel like such a World History nerd in there. I'm terrified of getting on people's nerves.   10:30 AM- I got to see my boyfriend before algebra class, which was nice since I hate algebra, so anything to make going to algebra class a little less miserable is awesome.   It's gotten to the point where I can barely try to focused in that class. The year is almost over, and all I can think of is how honors algebra has wrecked my GPA. I am going to be so relieved to have that behind me, so I can work to get my grades back up. I'm going to really need to make straight A's next year.  12:40 PM- We were doing some sort of heat energy formula, but it was all I could do to stay awake. I have got to start getting more sleep. I think I figured the formula out right at the end of class.  2:15 PM- I climb on the bus and promptly go to sleep. Almost to sleep, that is. I was just awake enough to hear the bus driver tell someone to wake me up when we were getting closer to my stop. I'm glad I was awake, because that would have been embarassing.  3:55 PM- I get off the bus. Since I didn't have any money at lunch, I find something to eat, go to work on my algebra, and end up falling asleep.   5:45 PM- My sister wakes me up for dinner. Then everyone else heads to church, but I stay home to finish my homework. Again, I really have to start getting more sleep.  7:45- I get on the computer to update my blog. And that's what I've been doing ever since. I think my boyfriend is going to call me in a little while. Hopefully we can do something this weekend so I won't be totally bored. Anyways, that was my day.
