I'm never going to remember i did this....   And I don't even see the use for a blog.  i mean, seriously, telling people all over the place about how i fell, etc?  Or what I think?  Who the fuck cares about how i think?  Or anything about me, is that important?  Stupid blog  ....  Didn't i say i was done a while back?   FUCKER!
