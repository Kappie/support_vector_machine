I stayed up till 12:30 last night doing God knows what. And I wake up late this morning. I tell Mom that I'm not gonna go to school since for the people that went to prom, they don't have to go since the teachers all understand and the teachers all told us (even the ppl that didn't go to prom) to not come to class. Anyways, I didn't do any work or study. All day instead I read Harry Potter. Harry Potter. I just started reading it for the hell of it. 700-something pages. I ended up reading all that. At first I was just gonna read a couple of pages. Then I was like, "Who died again?" And so I had to find out it was Sirius who died and I was like, "Why didn't I remember that? I mean it was Olga who spoiled it for me last year." Damn what a day wasted. Now I gotta go to Apex.   I'm so busy next week! Physics (last) test, Chemistry (big) quiz, and Chemistry (big) project/presentation. So much to do. And I have to get started on studying! I mean four exams in two days.   Day One : Chem at 8 (2.5 hours) and Accounting at 1:30 (2.5 hours)  Day Two : Geo at 8:30 (2 hours) and Physics at 1:30 (2.5 hours).  Shit I am sooo screwed.
