My real name is Laura, I'm 15 years old and I live in Cd.Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. I like a lot of things, but right know I'm in some kind of anime frenzy!! It's crazy, I keep downloadig anime as much as I can, and I love it. Series I'm into right now: Naruto Aishiteru ze Baby Samurai 7 Sailor Moon Live Action Neon Genesis Evangelion  Cha ne!
