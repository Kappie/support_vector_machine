While I am gone, I expect everyday, someone to post what we did as a group, then I won't feel so left out.  [boo-hoo]  and i suspose i will periodically be able to check this at some cybercafe or some shit.  if you guys miss me so much you can't stand it anymore you can always call my cell or you could just text message me, then I don't have to deal with roaming charges.  I will miss you all.  If you aren't jason, then you don't need to read any further because you might just up and barf all over your keyboard and computer moniter and I won't be there to bitch at: my little jas-ey poo, i will miss your chia pet like hair and chissled body; your condesending ass-iness and your elitest attitude, but most of all, I will miss your mother. xoxo your carlie-poo
