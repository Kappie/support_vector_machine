But despite all this In a very special way I love you as my best friend ever! You’ve conquest a special place in my heart Non-disposable Into my grave I’ll take you deep inside my heart Maybe till my next life Till the day as two strangers we meet again Fate Destiny Call it whatever… But can we avoid it? Can we run from it? I thought I could Now I’m not so sure. But I’m forever thankful for the moment we met I can say… In peace with myself, I shout to the world: -“I’m happy” Though I can cry when life gets tough I’m happy Hope you can feel the same If not now Someday Somehow  I just hope to be there to see you smile again I’ll never forget you!
