I talked to nathan for like an hour and a half last night on the phone. it made me quite happy.  but i'm still so amzed with myself. i read back on these entries, then look at how giddy and girl-ish i was last night. amazing. he somehow makes everything all better. how does he do it?! he's got that freaking charm about him.  i hate it, but love it all at once. i wish i had charm. or grace, or tact, or any of the things girls are supposed to have.  alls i got is the physical things girls are supposed to have. not that you all didn't know that. they're hard to miss.  but *sigh* i really wanna see him. i haven't seen in him in almost three weeks. wow. three weeks. i'm such a baby. lol  but yes. i got on matchmaker.com today. yes, yes, i am pathetic and i do go there. quite often... i'm a curious little pony. there are some interesting guys on there. and some are quite cute. but they all live a thousand miles away (literally) but i bet they'd be fun to atleast talk to. heh....i doubt anyone looks at my profile. i have no picture up, so everyone overlooks little ol' me. but that's ok....i'll upload a picture when i'm just totally deperate. not that the people on there do that....but yes....anywaz...  meh....i have to clean my room. i've been saying that since i got home. i haven't even unpacked yet. i've been living out of my suitcase.  i talked to mel today tho. it sux, she's leaving for dallas tomorrow. i wanted her to go to vino's with me on friday, Temper Effect is playing.  i want to see them. they look so good. *drool* and they rock. i love musicians. Musicians are the shiz.....*drool*  but anywaz, ima go. i have to make myself look decent. and i'm wearing this Systematic shirt that's too small, and litle hoochie shorts. heh...it would help if i straightened my hair and all that too...
