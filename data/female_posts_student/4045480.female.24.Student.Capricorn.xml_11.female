I got to go to the Cubs game today, they lost, but one of my best friend's brothers signed with the Chicago Cubs! And I was there to help their family celebrate, it was wonderful. Our seats were nine rows directly, and I mean directly, behind home plate. Dude I even got to see Bob Hale's '61 Yankees Ring. Talk about cool. As if that coolness wasn't enough the car was parked in the Player's lot, talk about G-rides, wow! I'm really happy for Dubber and his family, it's been a long time coming, but has finally happened.  As if that weren't enough excitement, we all had dinner and then I went out with the girls and Paulie:) It was great to have five guys dancing around us and two of them kinda vying for me. Danced on the bar with the girls, had some low carb booze, had guys all over us, and just had a blast. Definitely a great day. Oh and two possible set ups, not from the club this evening, but friends of friends, so that rocks. If anything, free dinners. Alright well I'm exhausted and I have step aerobics at 8:30AM. Goodnight!
