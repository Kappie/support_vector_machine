    
       so i'm at the crc gym this morning doing my normal routine like talking w/ customers, sitting around, and washing towels.  on one of my trips from the chat room cafe to the gym, i stopped to read the headlines in the paper.  while skimming the paper, i was asked, "what should todays pizza be?"  my first thought was bbq, but decided against it b/c bbq was already another main course special.  my second thought was fajitas.  i even mentioned spinach, but there was none in stock.  thus, my chicken fajita pizza was it.
