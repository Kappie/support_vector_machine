"thank you!"-me, after my mum bought me lunch. "no no, thank  you ."-mum. "for what? the pleasure of my company?"-me. "uh...no."-mum.  then after all that jazz in cambridge, i went on msn and watched tv for like the whole afternoon...then i had dinner avec ma famille. it was sweet, because they're cool.   oh my god.  i hate my brother. k, here's the story. my dad has a friend in australia (in canberra, to be exact), and he works at the business school. my brother, who's going back to high school for one semester in september, got an offer from my dad's friend to go work at the business school in canberra for the second semester next year.  IN AUSTRALIA. FOR A SEMESTER.  fuck. what a lucky guy.  "do they have, you know, electricity down there?"-my brother.  "so uh... how much money would i be earning?"-my brother. "i think about $16-20 an hour."-my dad. "are you joking? screw my job. i'm going down there to work for a semester with him."-my mum. (i hope she was kidding.)  so anyways.  i had the best dream last night. alexisonfire played at someone's house for their birthday, and there were like 5 people in the audience. so after they played, they hung out with us and we got to talk to them. it was pretty sweet...but, me being the loser i am, forgot my cd at home for them to sign. frik.  so tomorrow=canada day=riverside park with lots of people.  ah my dad booked mine and my mum's flights for england. we're leaving on july 26th, and coming back on august 5th. can't wait.  well i'm outtie yo. paice.  december was a long year.  kayte.
