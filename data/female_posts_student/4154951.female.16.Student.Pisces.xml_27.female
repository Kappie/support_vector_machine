I was like, a 5 minute drive away from that supermarket last night... Went to visit my newest cousin.. She's a few months old and she's such a cutie. Very talkative, like her cousin. >oP  Anyhoo, yeah.. I'm just thinking  (Me? Thinking? WOW!)..  Thinking about how bad it would be if Mark was reading this. It'd kinda decrease my chances with him, wouldn't it? Nyah well. Who says I have a chance in the first place?      My little sis is watching the Yellow Submarine DVD, right behind me. All Together Now is playing...        " Black ,  white ,  green ,  red , can I take my friend to bed?"       If I was of legal age in the 60's, I'd heck love Paul McCartney to be my best bud... >oP  Speaking of buds, three of mine are gonna see a Pete Murray gig tonight.. In my opinion, Bail Me Out would be a great song without vocals.. LOL, my friend Kaz just said she wouldn't pay more than $15 to see him in concert.. Nyeh, neither would I. Grr, I am a wee bit annoyed by Miranda Murphy's video clip for "That Girl"! I feel like slapping whoever came up with that idea to dress her up in famous vidclip outfits... That was my idea for my own first vidclip!! I aspire to be a famous singer, see. >o[  Ah well, maybe I'll just dress up as other famous people for my CD's lyric booklet. >oP  I'm also planning to be 'Paul' in the first kick-ass all-girl Beatles tribute band.. If there already is a kick-ass all-girl Beatles tribute band, email me! =o0      My sister just asked me to press 'Skip' on the DVD remote control- she doesn't like 'Only A Northern Song'.. It's like, WHY NOT?! The animation is full of psychadelic goodness, creep. Aww Jeremy Hillary Boob Ph.D is so cute! His annoying habits remind me of me... >oD  "Adhoc, adloc, quid pro quo..so little time, so much to know! Haha!"   He's a real Nowhere Man...       I just love the backing vocals on Nowhere Man...all those "ah...la la la" bits... LOL, I need a life.
