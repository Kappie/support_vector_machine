I'm so cool I have things that say Gucci, But too bad I can't get just one single smoochy, I like to wear my stolen thongs way up in my crack, I also like stealing books about things like smack. I think I'm in love cause every night I fuck this guy, Too bad everyone else in the world just wants me to die. I'm such a slut I love giving lap dances to chicks, And my mouth is poisoned cause I'm always sucking dicks, I said that I was ugly and that's the reality, But I'm a skitzo and I got another personality."
