Not much going on except that I have found a new favorite bar. Its not quite HOHO's and doesn't have a pool table, but any place where you only have to buy one drink and the rest are bought for you and you get to dance on the bar is one cool place. Its called the Filling Station and the best bar tender in the world works there. Her name is Kay and she even invited us to her wedding on our second night there. Gotta love that. Well hope everyone is doing alright!
