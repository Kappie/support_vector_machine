Walk                                           on, walk on                          With hope in your heart                          And you'll never walk alone.  I really need to get out of Jefferson. The longer I stay here the longer I ache.   I am happy for Heather, I really am. She is going to be able to take her life to an entirely new level, hopefully a level better than the  last. It is just hard to swallow the fact that I am not going to be able to see her very often anymore. She'll want to move onto bigger and better things, away from this part of her life she'll probably just refer to as a rut. And I don't blame her. I would probably do the same thing. Actually, I know I will do the same thing. But just a year later than she.
