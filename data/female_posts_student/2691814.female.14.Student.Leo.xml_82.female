I see Elizabeth rehearsing her lines for drama VPA and i get so sad cuz i can't go to DP. THIS SUCKS! gosh i really can't stand my life right now. Too much goin on. I found out that Cheston is doin weed and the person who provided it was Carl. That made me pissed and josh is tryin to deny that it happend. Poor josh...why does he have to put up with cheston.     Today..we were reading Night..the holocaust book...and its just too depressing. I can't stand that book. If only Dempsey would soften her heart and let us take a break from that book. It causes too much controversy and saddness. But OTOH...it is good for us to know about what happend back then.     OH YA and i saw a ghost today in the girls bathroom during 6th. That freaked me out. It looked exactly like Samantha had said cuz she saw it too. I was like...scared out of my mind but i didn't run for some reason. So im gonna ask bill what alla this is about. It was too weird..im telling the truth!    So anyway...I'm gonna go now and see if bills out so i can ask him.  Byes
