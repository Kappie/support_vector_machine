We met at arnd 2 plus and made our way.. Went to visit Linda at her Pizza Hut Centrepoint. For awhile onli.. Cos she had to get back to work after her break. When we reached the pizza hut, nana and me realised we were getting hungry even though i just ate b4 i went out! God.. Im piling on fast kilos.. Damn my metabolism rate! So we decided to walk to Far East's Sakura. One of our fave restaurants. There, i ate the usual tomyam claypot and nana ordered Thai Kway Teow.. Nice late lunch we had considering that we had our 'lunch' at 4pm. Hahaha.. After that,we went to take pics at the usual foto thingys.. During our 2nd pose.. Nana asked me to put on a serious pose. She had already put on hers and I was like laughing like mad cos i just couldnt put on a fake serious look!! I ended up laughing and she too! Cos my laughing is just too contagious. Had a crazy time with her inside the machine! God.. Then we made our way to Takashimaya. And.. we bought MUD PIES!! nono.. its chocolate pies.. Heavenly chocolate pies..! Taste damn gr8. We saw some performances outside Taka. This grp with lotsa diff drums.. And the ironic ting is that they were just promoting tea leaves frm Sri Lanka. Whats up with that? LoL. Nah~ Didnt see anyone familiar. Thats good.. LoL. It took my mind of him actually. But heck care,whatever. On the way home, which was realli early cos i had a planned dinner with my family, saw Ahmad who was making his way to school for a campfire. They wanted to gatecrash it.. As usual. Guess what? My family had dinner at Pattaya's Garden. Our usual family dinner place for Thai food. Damn.. I ate at Sakura for lunch and in just 4 hrs, im eating the same food. Not that Im complaining. Hehehe. I have to admit, Im born with a silver spoon in my mouth. =) Argh.. Couldnt eat much.. My stomach too bloated. Im gonna do my art folio later. Shld have started yesterday,but hurhur.. I got carried away.. I didnt do it at all. Fought with 'Awadh yesterday. Cos he bcame mad that i didnt sms him for43 days already. Haix.. U know,global sms now getting more expensive. How can i answer him that way? That would be downright rude. 'Awadh is Nana's cousin. Used to be frm my primary school but he moved to Malaysia when we were in primary 2 or 3. Yeah.. We sort of contact each other by e-mail or chatting every other weekend. He's a nice guy.. I cant deny that. When i told nana that he counted the number of days i didnt smsed him her reaction was like, " Itu sedara aku ker? " haha.. Nana, that is ur cuzin. Half smarty pants and half romantic.(Shh...) Hurhur.. His nickname for me is mangkuk and I call him pinggan. So thats settled and we're even on nicks. =) Well, 'awadh, if u read this, ( I dont think u wld aniway) im so sorry k.. I have my reasons. Blame it on him then. Ended what i had cos my pathetic feelings had to be for him instead. Hey..! Somebody, teach me how to add pics la!! Jepah.. faster!! I need pics on my blog here. And music too..!! Cepat la huzaifah..!! Aku nak pics  music on my blog. Cepat!! Hehehehe.. Jepah my fren la.. The next Brad Pitt with the versatility to act as Neo frm The Matrix or just any typical flirty Casanova. Hahahaz.. Oritee.. I have to end it here. Wanna do my Art folio. Topic's on Death btw.. And im drawing myself potrayed as a soul in her afterlife clutching on to a poem of death dedicated to the one she loves. And hoping that with the help of the poem and an only candle,she might find her way to her next destination in midst of the dark.. Yeah.. Lame.. But I wanna do my best cos every mark gonna affect my end-yrs! Wanna get that 1st position la this time. Its not that nice to always being 2nd. So anyway.. I'll end it here for this Saturday. At least Im happy today. No solemn faces and sad feelings for the day. Except the morning part. Hehez.. Orite2 I'll stop here.Now.   Nitez.. =)   ~Put my soul on hold...Let it drop like my heart..Cos thats how u want it to be~
