My tutor said that my presentation was so strong and convincing that he thought i had come from a marketing background. NICE. anyway, just spent the last 3 hours working on my portfolio and it wasnt even a real portfolio, its just one done on powerpoint so that i can send it to prospective employers. I am quite happy with it, but i just need to change a few things. Oh and no it didnt take me 3 hours to set up the PP thing- I am fine with that, it was doing things on Adobe photoshop that took me so long. anyway, now back to my last project. I really cant wait for school to be through. to think that my evenings will actually be free- my own time -- sounds like paradise!!   oh- another good thing- it looks like ill be going to japan this summer!! yeah! im running out of my cosmetics anyway, and i only trust the japanese kind for my skin. so fun fun. lots of catching up with ppl and relatives. one of my friends is getting married!!!!
