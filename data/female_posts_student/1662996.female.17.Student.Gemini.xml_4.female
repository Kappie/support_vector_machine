People being thrown across the room, tables being flipped, and beer bottles smashed over heads. Oh how I wish I was there to see it!   - Tornadoes ripped through. The sky hypnotized me. It was sweet.   - jaimos movin in fo sho! She might bring Ozzy (her cat) with her. My cat may just eat hers, we shall see how this will turn out! But either way it will be fun.   this is my last post of the day so night night all. I'm off to do some homework
