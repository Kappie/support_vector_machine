Great song:    "I don't want to be the one who's old before their time And loose the wonder that I felt as a child  I can't run this race believing I might lose  There's still so much to see, so much left to do  *~Yes I'll fall before I fly But no one can say I never tried~*  Oh we just get one Ride around the sun In this dream of time It goes so fast That one day we look back And we ask...Was that my life   I close my eyes and think how lucky I have been To hold the ones I love and share my dreams with them All those sunny days and all those starry skies Good morning kisses and sweet goodnights   *~I can't tell them enough Just how much that they are loved~*  Oh we just get one Ride around the sun In this dream of time  It goes so fast  That one day we look back And we ask...Was that my life..."   Great song. Beautiful. :-)  Well, that's about all kids. Luv ya, crazies.
