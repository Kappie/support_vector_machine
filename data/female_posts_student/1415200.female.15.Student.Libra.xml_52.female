I made the amazing new discovery that I absolulty am over the past, and I could care less! It's great. I feel so happy.  I havent felt that way in a long time. (yes, that means i feel ska.) Today, when I woke up, I thought about nothing at all. I had no worries, I had no complains (except it was too early and I was still tired) no stress about anything. I found by the way a new band that is awesome. Well, they may not be new, but they are awesome. 'The Postal Service' I love it! Its like emo-trance-bright-eyes goodness!  I need some more pink lemonade. That stuff makes it possible! I'll take 'O' for the win.  Oh, we suceeded in finding my ska thing. Yeah. As odd as it may sound, it's emo music, but in the same sense it's something else. Yeah I guess you could say that. Hum. ^ there a good band too! Goodness, Sarah's rapidly increasing A.D.D case is slowly wearing off onto me. I can tell.  I cant wait. I want to make a movie, 'The true life, of ding dong ditch.' And go around and play the prank on lots of people, and have me catch it all on film. That would be ah-mazing. I was kinda depressed today. I didnt get any carnations. At all. Everyone else did, but not me. I wish I could of gotten a silly flower. Even though it will die just like everything else. But oh well! enough of the sad stuff! Im gonna skidattle. Who ever is reading this needs to sign the tagboard. Yeah. Thats right. lol.
