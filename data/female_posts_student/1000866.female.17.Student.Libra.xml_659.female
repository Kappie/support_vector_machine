It kinda seems like they don't even want to be anymore. Well, if they don't want to be, I guess that's their choice. This is almost three times this week. If I hadn't called yesterday, they weren't going to invite me either. I knew this summer would suck. Oh whatever, I don't care. I just wish they'd have told me earlier so I don't bother.
