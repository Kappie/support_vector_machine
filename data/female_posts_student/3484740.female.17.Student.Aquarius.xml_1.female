Apparently he needs something right now, and I'm not totally sure what that is, but I hope he figures it out. I really did enjoy talking with him, and yes, I did make him feel bad about talking to me more than once. But I know that more than once he would do things to try and get me to feel bad, or to think about things, like make me jealous and things like that. I try not to do that very often, but sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do.   Anywho - - I guess thats all for now. Not a lot to talk about. And I really don't need anymore comments on here, unless of course they are needed. Then yes, but as far as any others, just ignore this. This is for me, and the few people I've told about it. But I suppose it really doesn't matter, I can change anything I want whenever I want. So whatever. I'll write more later! Bye.
