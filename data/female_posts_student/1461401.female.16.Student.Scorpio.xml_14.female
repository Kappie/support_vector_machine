Maybe it was my fault, maybe it was hers. Either way it didn't improve my over all mood for the day. I went to the office today to ask for a change of schedule form, only to realize all I need to do to give them a note. From my parents. Shit. I can't stay in band, I just can't. Not one of my friends could convice me to stay in anymore, not a single one. It's just not worth it. I need to find a way out... I don't know, I'll have to work on it. I'm finally working on one of my english projects, it's about time... ugh. Me
