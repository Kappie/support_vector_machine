Michelle and I did some shopping on Friday night. I love having friends who can drive, lol. We got to go to Woodfield, it was fun. Slept most of Saturday. We went out to dinner Saturday night to Japan 77. I love Japanese food. And today...there was a Law and Order marathon on TNT for most of the afternoon, so that kept me occupied. Other than that, pretty uneventful. Tomorrow, I have One Acts until 6:30. Not cool. Besides, I know I'll just sit there for most of the time. Whatever. At least I'll get my homework done.
