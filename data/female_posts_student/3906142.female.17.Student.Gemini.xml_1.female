Sometimes I would just cry on my bed, thinking of what I had gone through... I am really very tired... Why do I have to go through so many obstacles and in the end, I still lose them??  Why do I have to face all these alone?? For 2 years, my life was never going any better. 2 years back, it was my ex boyfriend who made my life miserable and upside down. Just when I thought everything would be better after we break, things became even worst than I expected. 1 year back, the guy I love a lot left me. I left my ex boyfriend 2 years ago was because of this particular guy whom I thought I love, and yet this guy leeft me 1 year ago. Perhaps this is retribution...   Why did I love someone who never love me? Why did I choose to hold onto him and never wanted to give up? Why was I so foolish and silly? I loved him a lot... I knew I couldn't do without him... When he left me, I was very scared he would forget me. I used to hate him for being heartless and cruel, but I never did hate him. The fact is I no longer blame him for anything now, because my feeling is already numb.
