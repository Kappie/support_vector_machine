This summer I am SUPPOSED to go to Cali with Cass, but after i tried to let her know that i cared about her, and i really still wanted her to graduate in MY CLASS. or, we could still go to Cali, instead of her going to summer school. I believe she called me a Fucking Bitch, and she wants me to apologize to her. So i guess i'll be apologizing for caring. BUt anyways. If i don't apologize, i'm not going to California.   I've also got my church's mission trip to Chicago that i'm going on. It'll be fun...ish. I mean i'm not really the BEST of friends with anyone going...'cept ashli, and well. My views on homeless people are a little bit different than anyone else's and well that makes me a really hostile person. so yeh. I'm also the oldest kid going...so that's kind of weird. But whatever.   So i'm really not here all summer. like i'm also going to a music camp, and soccer camp. and soccer state. so yeah i figured out today that i'm gone for all but 18 days of this summer...and not but one of those times is longer than 4 days...so I'm sad.  Mainly because of Matthew. He graduates this year, and well. I won't have the ability to see him everyday next year once school starts back up. So I'm really sad about that, and that's partly because these past few weeks of school he hasn't kissed me but once, and when he dd he said oops, because he thinks i might have mono. So therefore we haven't really seen each other out of school at all...this weekend or last. But i guess that just makes ME THE LOSER.   so yeah. i'm anxious and eager about summer. Just like i'm anxious and eager about next school year...but that comes in a later post, because this one is already a BUTTLOAD LONG!  -tori
