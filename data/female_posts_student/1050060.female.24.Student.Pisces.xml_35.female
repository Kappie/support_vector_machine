So i sent them a letter to explan things but of course i forgot to put my SIN number on it. So now i have to fax some the letter again to them. So that made my day even more crazy.   My death and dying course is pretty cool. I know i will enjoy it and it is an easy course. Anyways i have to get some homework done. Have a goodnight!
