His teeth grinned and his eyes winked a cornflower blue They shuffled their feet uncomfortably and looked around Convicts, murderers and and rapists stood huddled in a group Scarred, tattoed, dirty bodies stood awkwardly in formation My brothers! He called out in his starched, tailored suit Do not fear, for I have  saved  you! His coal black shoes shone silently like two patient puppies Sitting by their master's sides The men relaxed a little, one tittered softly, another lightly chucked his neighbor's shoulder and they looked at their surroundings in awe Welcome! His voice softened and his brillant twinkling eyes danced Embrace your new home His tanned long fingers parted and raised towards the heavens The men by this time were laughing and smiling, one had taken off his cap and flung it gallantly into the air My father! Sang one of the men to all the others I see my faith in God has paid off! He crowed to a particularly violent serial killer next to him The man in front of them grew agitated at this outburst The shiny new shoes clicked and tapped on the ground You realize you're dead then, all of you He said, eyeing them cautiously This is most unfortunate... His hands wrung and twisted the beautifully crafted browned fingers The men slowed their dancing and came to a halt, once again in the awkward configuration that they had begun in A brave soul, a young rapist, stepped towards their savior eyes full of trust and hope We've come to serve God he said in a small voice I can speak for my brothers when I say we know we've made mistakes but... Silence! Savior's voice grew sharp and tense, cutting through his gold polished air and dulling the shine of his eyes As I said before, I've rescued you! He grew excited, hands twisted more, sweat appearing on his brow You will not have to have faith in God any longer my sons! For I am your new savior! The assasins, slayers, killers and pain inducers of the world began to tremble in fear Their spokeman, a young man who had silenced the woman who had said no, now walked towards Savior once again  Where are we father? He asked submissively, eyes downcast and cap in hands Savior's eyes flashed, now as jet as the tailored suit Well don't you know boys? His voice was no longer welcoming, but sarcastic and cruel Oasis, Oasis! He said, maniac laughter bouncing off the walls The young man tried once again Please, father- are we in limbo? Is our fate decided yet? His eyes seemed hopefull as though he thought he had a chance Father looked down upon the men and began to chuckle softly Your fate, little soldiers is already done His hands, long and tan pointed downwards From here, we only go down and down, deeper and deeper The men began to tremble, fear began to pump into their hearts His million dollar suit seemed to gleam importance Normally I don't come up here for just anyone, but for a group of men as important as yourselves... His smile grew large, his eyes grew a dull film over the brillance How silly of me, I have yet to fully introduce myself He stood tall and made a most gallant bow to his subjects I am The Devil, and this, gentlemen is Hell....enjoy your stay.
