Today, I found myself thinking about the way I've lived my life thus far...    Would you want to go back in time, say, be 15 again, and start all over?  Is there any particular moment that you would like to relive, doing things differently this time around?  Sometimes I do regret things done or not done, but I realized that I wouldn't want to do anything over again.  If I did, I wouldn't be the same person.  The things I've done, the choices I've made, they're what makes me, me.  And I'm happy with that.
