In fact, I recall most of the recent stuff I have learnt.  There is a lot of homework though.  I have e quiz tomorrow and a unit test either Wenedsay or Thursday.  It is so fast!  I mean it's a good thing though, cause I just have to do this and NO MORE SOCIAL FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That feels so good, but our teacher makes the info pretty simple to understand and it is fairly intersting.  I also feel really smart cause like this morning no one was talking so I was answering all the questions.  I didn't have time to workout today though, and probably won't for a while.  That is just a scarific I must make.  I will have time after Summer School is done and on the weekends, except Megz and I are going to Stampede and got Rodeo tickets for Stampede.  The weekend after that I have Grandstand tickets and ChuckWagons cause I love watching the races and the show.  Anyways, I got to go read over the next chapter in the Social text cause I got a quiz on the stuff tomorrow! ;)
