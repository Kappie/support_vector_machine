The server I was using wouldn't allow me to delete multiple posts, which was becoming a common occurrence thanks to a few "ghetto" computers.  Tee hee.  Anyway, the sad part is that I lost all previous comments that you all have left.  Well, maybe it was a sign that I needed to do a little bit of spiritual...errr...bloggeral cleansing.  So, today was as I thought.  I was a little bit sleepy thanks to a late night, which was thanks to a certain AP Lit and Comp paper, which wasn't done early thanks to my procrastinatory tendencies.  Ahem.  Thankfully, I am now at liberty to rest at my leisure, after a 3-hour shift and a long day at school.  Tonight, Mom said she would save me some supper that I could have after work.  She decided to be creative, and, to my delight, tried with great success to recreate Ravioli di Portobello from Olive Garden.  'Twas simply divine.  I love my mommy.  *smile*  I don't know what I'll do at college when 6 out of 7 days a week the answer to "What's for dinner?" is "Ramen noodles.  Again."  Eesh.  There's only so many times in a month I can stand those.  My quota is easily reached, if you will.  Now, I will leave you, as my precalculus assignment beckons to me.  Yes, this time I will actually listen to it.  Well, m'dear, just as a note, I am very thankful that you're in my life.  I really am.  Honestly.  You keep me sane, and I thank you.  *smile*  Until the sun rises again, my friend.  I'm out.
