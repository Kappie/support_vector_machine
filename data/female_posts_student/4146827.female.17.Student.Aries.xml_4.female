Just feel very confused... And feel myself very stupid and naive for trusting others whereas trusting myself who I really feel that it is right...  Should I trust him back again? He has hurt me even more deeply than my ex... Yet, I am not sure... Don't bother anymore... Just know once bitten twice shy... Believe in yourself as you know what you really one... Must remember!!! Important rule...  Anyway, enjoy myself today... Went to arcarde and play till siao... Waste lots of $$$ today... Ha...ha... Well, at least not so sorrowful as yesterday... Look to the brighter side of things... Plus, beings single is great... Been through before lots of times... Ha...ha... Don't worry ok... No More Pestering... As per promise... Ha...ha... Be friends... The best for both of us...
