But the third question is a toughie. It's why I'm out blogging instead of answering. It's an open-ended question. Sounds easy but no; I'm suffering from writer's block.  This is the part on the UC application where I put down anything that I think the universities should know about me. My friend Robert advises me to put a sad, sob story---if I have one. It's pathetic but true. Colleges really lap up heartbreak. It's too bad I've been mostly spoiled throughout my life. Damn. I can totally write a fictionally sob story but then (knwing my luck) I'll probably get caught. Then no other college will even think of perusing my application. Cheaters only cheat themselves. So I'm told.  I still think Mrs. Cutler (the AP English 12 teacher) is an evil slave driver. (I thought the same for Ms. Burrows--my 7th grade teacher, but I dubbed her a minion from hell.) I know this is AP, but  come on ! I have a life too. Well it's like this. In addition to finishing the UC essay (which I guess I appreciate, lord knows I would have procrastinated in November), I have to do an annotated bibliography for 25 essays out of the Fields of Writing (someone should burn those those fields) and another annotated bibliography for 20 "My Turn" essays out of Newsweek. Hmmm....I don't know about anybody else but that a LOT of analyzing! Oh the slave driver also wants the UC essay due Monday, Aug. 2nd, I have less than a week left. Oh joy.  Earlier, I sent an IM to my "friend" Jessica. I used quotations because as of late I don't considered her a true friend b/c sometimes she is, sometimes she isn't. We're in a lot of classes and clubs together so I see her a lot. She's friendly when she needs me but when it's the other way around it's all ---> "oh, sorry, I'm busy...I have music...I have this...I have a test...I have mono..." Well okay I made the last one up but she's really is like that! It's only academics (and the flute---out of all the instruments to choose...the flute...) with that girl. Another thing is that I would be talking to someone in class and she butts right into the conversation. All of the sudden I'm out of the conversation because she has steered it to something I either really don't care about or have no clue about. Or we're in a club meeting and she hardly acknowledges that I'm there. Well, that's  some friend . Honestly, that why I hardly study with her. Also, it's not as if she needs me there anyway; she can handle it herself---she is uber brainy.  Anywayz, I need to get back to the essay if I want to meet deadline. Bientot!
