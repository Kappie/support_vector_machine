So yeah, spent most of the day getting ready for that.  We’re off to Des Moines tomorrow, Mom, Erik, Nile, and I.  It should be fairly entertaining.  Plus I want to get some more ‘dressy’ summer clothes, I need to quit being a slob and only wearing T-shirts and jeans.  But I LIKE them….ah well.  Gahhhh!  Cripe.  Frustration to the extreme.  I need something, I don’t know what, but something.  Perhaps its just finding a way to be content with here and now.    I need to copy some of Seth’s music.
