So I worked with Nicole today at the Gift Shop, and we were talking about visiting our friend who's in the hospital and bringing her a card. So I go and ask the lady at the front desk what rom shes in.  And it was confidential!  Totally Gay...if people want to bring her flowers and cards, they can't unless they talk to the parents.  Thats stupid! I'm not gonna call them up and talk to them...I barely  know them!  So we're gonna talk to the b/f and see if he knows what room she's in.  Prolly, plus she'll be there for a while so I suppose we're not in a rush.  Ahh...now I'm off to watch some hot boys play baseball; should be fun! haha, North vs. Arrowhead...enough said!  Oh yeah speaking of the north baseball team...Tony Memmel was in the Freeman today!  He was interviewed because he plays baseball with only one arm!  The article kicked ass, and I thought it was awesome seeing one of my good friends finally get recognition for something so unique...he totally deserved it!  The man's beenin everything, and I dont think he's ever gotten any props for it!  Oh well, hope he plays well today! As Joe would say:  Have a good one Everyone!
