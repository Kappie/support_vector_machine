Then Nicole came to my house, and Nicole, Ben, Andrew, and I all watched the fireworks, and lit some of our own.  Then at like 11 Jared came out and I made pizza and popcorn chicken for everyone.  The only problem was, I spilled the chicken all over the floor.  Opie still ate it though.  Gross!  Then at 12:30 we all went to Heather's house to meet Heather, Sebastian, and Amy because we were going to go and t.p. Scott's house.  So we go to Scott's house and start t.p.ing, but Nicole, Heather, and I all hear this noise, and then everyone starts running for the cars.  All the sudden I see two people dressed in black, with masks on, running at us with paintball guns.  We jump in the car and go back to Heather's house.  And then we realize that we left, like, 48 rolls of toilet paper at Scott's.  So everyone but Ben and Opie went to Meijer in Nicole's car with Sebastian driving.  When we got back we couldn't find Opie and Ben, so we went to Scott's thinking they might be there.  But their weren't.  So Sebastian and Jared go to check it out up by Scott's house and they never came back, so finally us girls went to see if we saw them, but we thought we saw someone in the tree so we ran back to the car.  Finally we got a hold of Ben and Opie and they came out and found Jared and Sebastian. Then they left to go and get their paintball guns.  We still couldn't find Jared and Sebastian ourselves though.  Finally we get the courage to go up and see for ourselves and then we start t.p.ing some more.  Finally we go back to my house, but ohh, it is still not over.  Ben, Opie and I all wait at my house while Heather, Jared, and Sebastian all go to Wal*Mart and buy more toilet paper.  Then at 4 we go to Scott's again and get him good!! But when we got done we realized Ben has a very flat tire, so 6 of us had to fit into Heather's car which only fits 4!! And Jared was driving.  Then as we went to pull out, a cop goes buy, and he slows down.  We are panicked.  Then He follows us to the stop sign and flashes his lights at us.  I am freaking out, and Sebastian keeps making jokes to lighten up the mood, but it didn't work!!  Finally he tells us that the plates on Heather's car don't match those on her regisration, so he goes to his car for awhile, and then comes back and tells us that he should impound her car right then, but he wasn't going to.  He told us we would have to go and get Ben's truck today , which we all ready have done.  So yeah, now Ben and I have a curfew, and we aren't allowed to go t.p.ing anymore.  Well I am soooo tired. Talk more later.   Buh Bye!
