(i always do that nowadays), and i made a list of things to pack for england... i'm so gay. then i kindof hung out with my mum, went on msn again... omgsh i watched air bud spikes back.  worst movie ever.  there is not  one  decent actor in that movie. god.  anyway. after doing all that jazz, i had dinner, then i went to the movies with jess. we saw stepford wives... it's a sweet movie! it was kindof scary at times though. aha during the movie, i dropped my phone...and the battery fell out, and i couldn't find it. so i waited till the movie was done and some lights came on, and me and jess tried to look for it...but we couldn't find it. so we had to get one of the guys that works thurr to get a flashlight...but instead, he turned on all of the lights in the theatre...but we still couldn't find it. then he left again to get a flashlight this time, and we found it before he got back. ahahahah. t'was funny.  anyway. i FINALLY got those bracelets that some people like to call  sex bracelets  at the dollar store...but they only had black. assholes. so i bought 2 packets.*grins*  ack i saw morgan again yesterday... at the movies. it was sweet.  so after the movie, we walked around in the deserted mall and went outside and waited for jess's dad to pick us up. then i went home, and went on msn again. woor.  anyway. no plans for today.  sifting through weathered photo albums, looking for gloriously aged polaroids of places you have never been.  kayte.  p.s. 22 days. p.p.s. mike (chaulk), you suck more.
