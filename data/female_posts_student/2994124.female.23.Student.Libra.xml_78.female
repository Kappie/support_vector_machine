Hasn't been a great day, but hey I made it through.  And for the first time, instead of bottling things up I summoned up the courage against the fear of rejection and phoned Lizzy and popped round there after church this evening.  We ended up having a good chat, and I've just got home now.    What else did I do today? Um... bought an electric toothbrush for 99p - not sure how good it will be at that price but hey! Also made some cards this afternoon. They weren't too bad for my first attempts.  Well I won't ramble on any longer. Sorry for the dull blog, hopefully something exciting will happen tomorrow which will give me something to write about!  Night mexx
