You can't really tell, but near the top left corner of this pic is the beach, and it is one of the most gorgeous beaches I've ever seen. Lots of white sand and very secluded. We stopped at the beach on the way back to the car at the end of the hike and I met a very friendly little brown bunny! He ran away before I couls nap a pic though. urlLink
