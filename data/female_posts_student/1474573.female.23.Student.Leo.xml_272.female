The filing has gotten to the point of overwhelmingness.  (Yes, I just made that word up, AND?)  I have no idea where to begin!  So far I've organized it into piles.   Pile #1: Its in a folder and I know where it belongs, I just have to walk my lazy ass over there to do it. Pile #2: Its loose but I know where it belongs, see above as to why I havent done so. Pile #3: Shit that is labeled by the bossman, but I still dont really know where it belongs. Pile #4: What  is  this shit and where does it belong?!  Yeah... so basically I realized that all my problems stem from my laziness.  I think I took the fact that my dad called me "Princess" and "Muneca" a little too far.  I  must  have had servants in a previous life...there is no other explanation to the laziness now.  That's my conclusion and I'm sticking to it.  Hmmph.
