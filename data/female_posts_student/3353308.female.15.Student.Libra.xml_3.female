I have a shoe fetish, anyway) and all of the sudden I saw a picture that looked like a guy who had graduated from our swim team a few years ago. Then I looked at the name and it was him - that's not a little wierd or anything. Anyway, this is like my friday b/c I have an art field trip tommorow - thank goodness b/c math today def flew right over my head and i can wait till mon to take the quiz - anyway have to go do stuff
