OH and my friend brandi is going to become a famous singer one day and she sang for my family for the first time while we were at shliterbahn..she tryed out for american idol and you know what they told her!?!?! they told her they couldnt accept her because she was too good of a singer and they didnt want to bring any good people on the show that simon could bring the self estem level down and ruin there dreams and they were looking for people that werent verygood. i was sooo pissed. i refuse to watch the stupid show anymore. anywho..my firend from louisiana came and visited me..it was fun..only shes involved with a guy that dosnt give a rats panties about her and it sucks cause i cant do anything about it cause then she'll just think im jealous when im not..i just know this guy on a more personal level than she does...WHAT DO I DO!?!?...HELP..my friend brandi introduced me to this REALLY great guy named Chance..he was so chivalrus..sweet..cute..honest and most importantly..he made me laugh so hard it hurt...the reason i say he WAS all of these things.. is because a week ago tonight he died...this is really hard for me to write but ive been so stressed out about it lately and i need to get it out..on july 17th he went skating with 3 other friends of his and at like 8 or 9 they decided to go swimming and chance really didnt want to because he didnthave the strength from skating all day..but he went anyway..he got tothe middle of the lake..and decided he just couldnt do it..so he turned back..wellit was dark and plus the lake was really merky and he just didnthave any energy so he drowned...he screamed for help but by the time Troy got to him...it was too late..his friends called the piolice and search and rescue...they got to the lake at about 5am that next morning..it took 5! passings of the lake to find his body..its so devestating to lose a friend..and i hope none of you ever have to endure that..its nothing anyone deserves...not even jacob..witch i might get into later..GRR..anyway..Chance if u can hear me..you were a wonderful person, a wonderful friend. no matter how mad, pissed, or sad i was.. you had some way to make me smile and laugh again. im never going to forget you. im just so glad i had the chance to know you before you passed..even though it was such a short time. i know your in a better place where you can never be hurt again. i love you......*lets long breath out*...anyways..im just gonna go.. ill tell you about jacobs prick ass later... bye
