The reasion i started this thing was to get out and talk about things that bothered me, and stuff. But lately as you no, i havnt been bothered by too many things. Things are really good, and i havnt been givin you a play by play with #3 casue i duno, all yall need to no is that things are good. And things are good. In every way. Well execpt for my bother. ehhh. He has always done little things that buged me but this time (hes still in town) its just really been getting to me. Ok honestly, most of you wont believe me but my dad favors my brother. I swear to God. Its always aww poor gabe, oh you broke our lamp from paris, oh you got perment marker all over our couch, oh your really an ass hole to everyone, oh you leave us to baby sit your puppy, its no big deal. I swear to God if i ever, EVER did ENYTHING NEAR like breaking something like that or ruining the couch, woah. Id be yelled at for days, have to clean it up/pay for it and i would be in sooooooooooo much troble it would be unbelieveable. But no, gabe doesnt even get a slap on the wrist. It makes me so mad. Gabe went to jail for a bunch of pot in his car and what did he get, a "dont ever do that again speech" and a new car? becasue his old one looked like a stoner car??? wtf? If my dad knew that i had even smoked one cigrette ever, id be grounded till i was 18. I dont get it, for gabe-jail=new car, for me-jail=i dont even what to think about it but it sure as hell isnt anything close to a new car. And he is so rude and mean to my dad, like he brutally makes fun of him and my dad lets it slide. But i say one little thing and oh wow, its over. And another thing, since my dad has all this extra stress when gabes here, and no where to put it since he wont give it to gabe like he should, i get it. Ill sit on the couch and hell yell at me for it. It sucks. And im not making all this up, i thought i might have been exagerating it untill my mom and i were talking about it and she said the same thing. How dad takes all the gabe stuff out on me. But then my mom says "well its becasue he holds you at a higher standard than gabe, hes knows you can do more and that your smarter. And he thinks that if he slacks off with you like he did with gabe then you wont live to your full potentional like he could of, like he knows you can." But whatever, its still not fair. Ok now that the teeny tinyest part of the whole gabe thing is out i feel a little better. Well for now, until he comes back from ruidoso, does something else wrong and my dad looks the other way. I love my brother to death and i no hed do anythign for me but grrrr all this gets to me soooooo bad.
