She's your typical middle-class teenager, pretty, friendly, smart. We were talking about jail and prison, and I mentioned how my brother spent some time there for getting into bad fights. [He'd only served a year].    While we were on this subject, Laurie had mentioned that her brotherwas in jail, and still is. I asked what he was in for, she said murder. I asked how old her brother was, she said 23. As soon as she said it, I knew who he was. Living in a small town, there's not a lot of murders. The age alone told me who it was. 7 years ago, when her brother was 16, he and his best friend were completely out of their mind on drugs when they were taking a cab somewhere. They strangled the cab driver, cut his throat and beat himwith a hammer til he died. They got $40.    Later on, he went to his girlfriend's house, dropped off his school bag with the murder weapon and bloody clothes in it. He'd told his girlfriend [who would later on date my brother for a couple of months] what he'd done, and that he was going to play some pool with friends. He left the schoolbag in her room under her bed. She called the cops after he left, but didn't tell them about the schoolbag because she didn't know that there was anything in it and she didn't really think of it. A couple days later, she remembered the school bag, opened it up, found the evidence and went the cops. She was charged and put on probation for not telling them about it sooner, which is fucking ridiculous.    Anyway, Laurie was in Grade 5 when her brother did this. She told me that it ruined her family andthat her mom went into deep depression. Laurie was diagnosed with manic depression the following year and began self-mutilating and tried to commit suicide for years after that. Her family was spit upon because of what he'd done. She told me thatshe had trouble making friends ever since then. No one wanted to let their kids hang around with "the murderer's sister." The teachers were mean to her, adults were mean to her, parents and kids alike were mean to her. She told me that her bestfriend's mother wouldn't let her go over to her house after that because she thought Laurie might murder her daughter. She said for the better part of 4 or 5 years she just wanted to die. She's on medication for depression now...7 years later.    She told me that her brother was always a good kid, and very intelligent. She said he'd got bored and got into drugs and it washis downfall. She said that she's scared to have kids when she's older because she doesn't want them to have the same type of problem because she said that kind of thing runs in her family. I felt so bad when she was telling me this stuff...when something like this happens in a family, nothing is ever the same. Her brother has a 25 - life prison sentence, he is elligable for Parole next year, but she doesn't think he'll get it. He was supposed to be able to come home for her High School graduation next year but they're not going to let him now.    Manic-depression and suicide is a big thing on my mom's side of the family. I, myself, have been on medications for severe depression, insomnia and social anxiety. For the past few years, I've always cursed that side of the family for it...but it's nothing you can help. I suppose things will happen that are meant to happen.
