I've been reading tho, ever since harry potter has come out and lotr has been made into movies, about ppl who seem to think that   Hp + LotR  ----------- = Something satanical  religion   i mean seriously, ppl get a life! First of all, there is absolutely nothing satanical about these books! geez! harry potter is especially persecuted (because well jrr tolkien was a strong catholic -so forget lotr-)  but saying that:   1) it goes against the principles of god and religion  -come on!, these ppl only say this because god is not at all mentioned in the harry potter books, nor is religion mentioned, butthis is a fantasy book not a bible and those ppl will realize that if it does not talk about god it doesnt talk about god being non-existent or evil or whatever, either; it doesnt give people ideas. And they say that because it talks about magic it goes against all principles of religion, well o dearie me pardon me, wasnt jesus' miracles like magic for those who saw them? besides every kid thinks about what the world would be like if something magical happened once in a while, so should we ban kids from society then? or punish them? of course not!   2) it promotes satan worshipping -  and at this point i laughed so much because this did not make any sense. I have seen hide nor hair of anything relating to satan worshipping in the harry potter books (maybe reading the book backwards tells u to worship satan !*gasp*). seriously, there is evil in this book because theyre has to be (where would a book go without a bit of evil) and in case these ppl havent noticed so far the GOOD side always wins. so ha! now even if there is voldemort -which is pretty much the closest thing to satan in the books- u will notice that way more ppl are against him then with him.. and the ppl against him are good do i need to spell it out for u? G-O-O-D, they are brave, smart ppl who do anything to protect the ppl they love (now would anyone tell me, does satan help the ppl he loves? nooooooo he doesnt love anybody and im pretty much sure that he wouldnt bother being brave and GOOD either, not too mention the fact that satan most likely doesnt exist because he has never manifested himself.) Come off it! Kids get more bad ideas about the world and life and satan IN SCHOOL THAN BY READING HARRY POTTER!!!!! well then lets ban schools shall we?   3) it promotes  -what was it the guy said-  the occult  -something like that-   riggggghtt. so basically what hes saying is, it promotes people doing witchcraft. uh huh. now, does anyone see little kids truly believing that they are a witch or wizard and actually, seriously, as tho their life depended on it, saying latin spells and levitating things? no. besides even if they tried to, how many times would it work eh? like none; it definitely would not work. and i think that the rest of us who arent little kids and who happen to be much smarter and knowledgable than they are,know that witchcraft ''like what harry potter does'' is entirely fictual and not at all dangerous in real life.   And so i ask where the hell do u see these books having a negative impact on someone? have u seen it on the news? -like a teenage boy killing somebody and saying; well he tried to curse me OR i killed him because he said harry potter sucked- erm, no, ok? no.  if kids are actually reading and taking the time to let their imagination take a spin isnt that a good thing? i think that parents who consider these books harmful to their children are parents who try to swallow their children up into their own world and not let them be independent. if anything, harry potter promotes the ideathat good is better than ''evil'' and that those who join the ''evil'' side will get nothing good of it ( look at wormtail). Thereare more evil and satanic things on the eleven oclock news (what with murders and gang drug dealings) than in the harry potter books. so get a life and read it and then tell me if u believe that neville is promoting satan worshipping or if perhaps hermione or professor mcgonagall are.   and might i add that nobody (not even normal little kids -those who have reached sufficient intelligence and not those whobelieve absolutely everything including that there are monsters under the bed-)believe that harry potter is real anyways so there is nothing they can do to imitate him or get in contact with him or whatever.
