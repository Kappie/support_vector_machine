It's too bright!!!!!!  Ahhhh!!!! I'll just retreat into my lair and stay there for the rest of the day.  All i do is nap now.  I love to sleep.  I love to dream.  Mium, mium i think i might take a nap right now....I want to play tennis but i have no more racket.  I gave my cousin back hers in order to buy a new one for my b-day but they ran out of my size... :'(
