We all know how these shows work, you get there early stake your claim for space, roam around, get some sun, and relax. However, since we were there so early, we set up right up front. I hadn’t anticipated how much of a disaster that would be. As the acts got bigger more and more people invaded our space. This is something that I expected, however I could have never anticipated how rude people were. They just pushed their way through, not ever looking back at whom they might have shoved behind them. In fact, there was a guy who set his blanket up next to ours, and by close to the end of the show, he was no where to be found and people had taken over his blanket. As if these people had no respect for someone else’s space. At one time I did see him, crowded by people, who were almost pushing him out of the way, how dare he be there on his own blanket? Moments like those make me scream inside in defense of other people. What does it take for people to feel empathy? What does it take for people to have some respect and consideration for other people? What has happened to people? When did we get so selfish?  Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!
