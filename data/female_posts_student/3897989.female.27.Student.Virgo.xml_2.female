With a new outfit, a new outlook, and a happy, giving heart.   Open to your true essence.  Love,  BLG  P.S. Class went really well last night. We practiced some openers and myofacial warming to prepare for deep tissue. I got to be the body. Our teacher is so talented. I wish he would embrace it more willingly. It's funny how he worked with everyone else last night except me. His observations were satisfying I hope. I shouldn't doubt myself. I know he was pleased.
