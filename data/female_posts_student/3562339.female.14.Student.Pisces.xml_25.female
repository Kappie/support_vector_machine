Today I took my Science Final, which was just Mr. Plumly's desperate attempt to have more than 5 people pass his class.  I mean, it's an EXTRA CREDIT, OPEN NOTE Final, how desperate is that?  Well it was really easy anyways, and i didn't even need my notes, so whatever.  Basically, if you get your average or higher on the final, you get 10 extra credit points, which really doesn't do much for the people who actually need it, so yet again, another stupid idea from Mr. Plumly!  And since I have like a 96 average (almost as good as Alicia, grrr), it doesn't really matter anyway.    Oh yeah, and just as Alicia has, I've been trying to find all the secret facts on  urlLink J.K. Rowling's Official Website .  So far I've found three, just as alicia has, and I can't think of anymore places to look.  IT'S REALLY ANNOYING!!! Grrrr.  So yeah, that's basically what I'm wasting my time on at the moment.  ONLY 6 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu
