Stop complaing. :P  Anyway, my brother, his girlfriend, her room-mate, and her room-mate's son came down for a visit, which involved frogging (though not frog-gigging per se), canoeing, swimming, stargazing, and me teaching everyone (except my brother, who knew already) how to play Go. Had lots of fun and funny conversation.   Ironically, the one thing we never got around to was fishing, which was primarily what they had all come down for, heheh.   My bro's leaving sometime tomorrow :( Eh bien. I wonder if he won't be back in time for my birthday, which is on 17 July.   I have to grok math to ace my GED's and SAT's, so I'm studying it. REALLY need to bone up on my geometry, though my basic arithmetic and algebra are decent (more decent than I had thought). Hopefully I'll be shipshape within a week or so.   -Theo
