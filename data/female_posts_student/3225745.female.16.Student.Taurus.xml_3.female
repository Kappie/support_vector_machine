I dont think the fact that school is out has actually hit me.  i am going to go see mean girls with a few girls from oakridge. maybe then it will set in.  im a junior now and i can not believe it.  only two more years till i am off to college.  i can not wait.  I am just letting this pass by me.  Well im gonna go take a shower.  See you later.  Bye.
