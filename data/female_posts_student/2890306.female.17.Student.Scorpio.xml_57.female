I am afraid that AudioBlogging will be to typed posts what email was to snail mail, which is of course making it obsolete.  I have decided to fight this impending overthrow in power (aka: coup) by actually  typing  today's update!  Yay for America; we can protest here.  Hmmm, you know, that would make a great slogan for our country.  And a great title for this post, as you can clearly see.  So, today.  It's always about today, isn't it.  Yes, well, I woke up on my own promptly at 9 A.M.  I didn't need an alarm, Mom, or anything else to assist me.  I tell you what, this whole body internal clock is an amazing thing.  Too bad I haven't put it into use until now, eh?  Well, maybe not.  As I said, it's always about today.  After getting up and eating an eclectic breakfast (chips and salsa, a nectarine, and one slice of pumpernickle rye toast), I went to work at 11:45.  It was great, perfectly complimenting the rest of my 24-hour chunk of life (aka: day).  There, I found out that I got a 50 cent raise on my pay!  *sings in a tenor-type voice*  HALLELUJAH JESUS!    That means that every two hours, I'll have an extra buck than I would have had before!  I'll take it.  Most definitely, since I have 37 hours this pay period, and I'll be rolling with the homies.  Or rolling in the money.  Whichever you prefer.  I like the first one because it was on Degalau's tee shirt.  Speaking of Stephanie, Mom and I saw Chasetifer at Barnes and Noble today.  When we went inside, he went straight to the architecture books, and I laughed to myself.  I can't wait to see what all of my senior friends become in their later years.  A seemingly random thought I know, but they're all so incredibly gifted that they can't help but do great things.  In fact, they already are.  To go  back to the future  (Wow, my segues are great today.  First, Jello to Chase.  Now, Chase to Back to the Future.  I am on a roll with the homies.  Anyway.)  Let me start over.  To go back to the future, yesterday was Jello's celebration which she knew nothing about (aka: surprise party).  It was  muy divertido  as it was the first one I had ever participated in.  Also, it was fun to find out some new facts about my lovely friend, such as she loves Marilyn Monroe and Jelly Bellies!  Little morsels like that are the spice of life and also make for great gift ideas.    Later in the party, we went to Terrace Park and walked in the gorgeous Japanese gardens.  Did you know that someone vandalized those recently?  I was shocked to hear that.  Now, as Mom says, the city is going to build a fence around it so people cannot access the park at night.  I hope it's not an ugly fence.  Anyway, we had fun at the gardens, especially when playing in the step waterfall.  AJ got the brunt of our splashing, but didn't seem to mind.  It was a hot night, and the refreshment was well received.  That pretty much sums it up except for one short blurb (aka: thing).  I had lunch with my daddy today and I love him.  Remember Father's Day on June 20.  Now, that's what I call a post.  'Cya.
