The feeling of nothing is Thinking about why you exist, Daydreaming about if nobody ever existed what would happen, and Trying to deal with life knowing you will die.  When I think of nothingness, I think about the fact that We are alive for a certain number of years, We struggle with society to stay alive, and Then when we are on top of the world we die. We have everything we could possibly need, but What happens to that when we leave? Do we disappear into a pit of despair and nothingness, or Do we reincarnate into something we would hate to become. Do we go onto the "other side", or Do we stay in between the real and the fake.  Having to experience life is in itself the true feeling of nothingness.
