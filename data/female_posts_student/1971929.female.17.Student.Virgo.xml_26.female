Anyway, I'm going to be leaving tomorrow at 7:00 AM and arriving sometime next Saturday around 5:00 PM. Some people tell me I'll have a good time, and I really hope they're right. After all, it will be a whole week's worth of whatever it's going to end up being, and thus I pray for it to be enjoyable. Supposedly someone is going to be posting daily on the  urlLink Mission Trip Website . There's also a place for you to  urlLink contact me  while I'm on the mission, like send me a good luck e-mail or profess your undying love for me. Either way, I'd love to hear from you. I'll have my mother's cell phone and I just might call some of you during my absence. According to my sources I'll have about an hour every night to do so. Well, wish me luck. I shall miss the lot of you. Well, maybe not Trevor because he was mean to me today. I sure hope I didn't forget anything.
