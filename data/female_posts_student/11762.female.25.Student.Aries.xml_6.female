I hold on to my fortunes, those little paper notes that following in the wake of a simple cracking of a cookie.  I have it taped to my computer monitor, this one fortune that reminds me to savor life and live for the moment.  You will discover the truth in time . I meditate on these words every single day, searching for a better understanding of what they mean in relation to my life. At first, I thought the note was a message from Godde about my ex-boyfriend, putting me at ease about our troubled relationship, letting me know that we would overcome our differences and move forward together. How naive was I, to think that I knew the meaning of truth, the meaning of time?  There are moments in my life, where I feel like I am in a rush to learn everything at once. I worry that I will run out of time and that I will never discover the truth about myself, this world, and Godde. I obsess over the fear that I will never find a safe, comfortable, loving relationship with a man. There are so many items that occupy my mind, that drive me to distraction. It is only my faith, my love for Godde, that allows me to take a deep breath and force these thoughts out of my mind. I remind myself that there is a plan, a purpose.  Despite the presence of my fears, I feel more grounded now than I have at any other point in my life. I have a wonderful job and my career goals for the future have come full circle in the wake of my return to school. I am surrounded by the most incredible support network of family and friends. I go to an incredible church, a place where I am encouraged to think about my faith instead of blindly accepting doctrine. I have a cat who adores me. Truly, I am a blessed woman.
