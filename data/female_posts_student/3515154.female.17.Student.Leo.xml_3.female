I didn't get to talk to David today...*sniff*Sniff* He leaves for Arkansas tomorow!! That means I have to wait a week before I get to talk to him again! Everyone is going away on Vacation and its crazy...No one here to talk to! Finally tomorow I am going to the Doctor and he better say that I'm better or else!! I'm serious!so... MY DAY Well someone called at 3am and woke me up 3 times...which I got mad cuz I was sleepin. DARN YOU! and then Of course I got woken up at 7:30 when Debbie brought Maggie over. I went back to sleep and got woken up again when Dee called me at 9 ish and then the DANG street sweeper came at like 11:00 and woke me up again! So I'm kinda cranky cuz I didnt get much sleep! ARG! So then I talked to DeeAnn and we talked for a little bit...Nothing eventful really...the Cat has been coming around me more lately..I think shes jealous of Maggie...cuz When the baby is over here She doesnt get any attention from Heidi so...Man I'm in love and I dont have the person that I love around me...of course you know the object of my affection is David Alan Hunter...and I will never ever ever lose my love for him...holy poop I love him alot. Well this evening it stormed and ever since the wreck I've been afraid of thunder so I was off to myself in my room while it was storming...Man I really have a boring life...I want to go see Harry Potter on Friday, but I have NO one to go with...which sucks. Hopefully David and I are still going to go see the day after tomorow cuz i really want to see it!!Anyways it finally quit storming, and I finally got to get back on here. But thats about all I'm gonna write about today because it royally sucked!! Sleepy time...
