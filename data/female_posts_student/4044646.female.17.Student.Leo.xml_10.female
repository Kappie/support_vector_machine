But since i've mentioned band I might as well talk about it..... it's going well we've learned half the opener already and know some visuals which will be cool if everyone does them right.. musics okay can be better the brass is still behind with knowing their music where as woodwinds are doing well for the skill level of the music. and yeah I dunno what else to talk about already cause my eyes are slowly starting to drop eventhough I not mentally tired....hum yeah there's supposed to be a meteor shower tonight from 2-6am... I really want to go out and see it but im afraid once I do fall asleep, that it will be extremely difficult to get up and then not be able to see anything.... so I dunno about that just yet.... You know what guys are jerks.. yeah and 99.9% of the time they know they are too and dont give a shit about it either.... I think it's because they don't want other males noticing that softer side they have and always have to show that macho alpha male crap... pffftt yeah right thats what makes them so cool.. NOT.. lol welp yeah this has been some major random crap this evening and now I think im going to go to bed now....  peace out!
