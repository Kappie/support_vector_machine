I went to Ottawa today to see Jordan's new appartment and to check out some stuff @ BestBuy, namely  urlLink 4th Generation iPod  and computer stuff. I totally found a flat screen monitor for $299, which is super sweet cause that's not expensive at all for a flat screen, so guess who's all over that - yeah that's me! But bad news is is that they don't know when the 4th generation iPods are going to be in Canada. {dramatically looks out the window} haha. Yeah so I'll have to wait a bit for that one - so much for those long music-filled country road walks I was planning but didn't mention to you guys BECAUSE YOU'D SO LAUGH AT ME and try and discourage me from *GASP* exercise. You're mean (cough, Cassandra).  So this week TheMoney is getting transferred (woo that sounds like some crazy black market deal, no? And I don't know anything about your passport being missing, Leslie. Cough.) into my account this week so that means that the second it's in there, is the second I'M ALL OVER THAT COMPUTER I'M GETTING. All over it. Oh yeah and I bought a pot and a pan for $7 each.  Nice . And a bookbag for like $14. Beggars can't be choosers. Sortof.
