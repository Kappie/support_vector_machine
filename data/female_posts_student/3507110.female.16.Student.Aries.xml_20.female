Nothing to worry about, no eggshells to fall upon and cut my skin, nothing to bleed over, nothing to wake up for. No hope, no sanity, I think that sounds just fine. I wake up only to want to go back to sleep because every little thing I do, everything little thing I say, is somehow wrong, either to me or them. I can't make anybody happy because I can't even be happy myself. My optimism is forced, bright cheery attitudes fake because that's not really me. There is this dark side of Sam that few ever truly see, though faint glimpses will show to those privileged few. I can't help those around me in pain because I myself am hurting, dazed and confused from feeling guilty over nothing. My best friend's mother is dying and before I return to school, I'll be attending her funeral. If it hurts me this much and makes me so damn sick, I can't even imagine how she feels, hurt, alone, pathetically weak and powerless, but above all, the anger. Resonating anger that permeates beneath the skin and cannot evaporate through the small pores. It builds and builds and soon the smoke pours out of the eyes and the fire races into the brain and all the eyes can see is flame and blackness. Watching her suffer makes me feel guilty for feeling so down, for feeling like Sam, depressed, dark, and sullen. If I feel ashamed for feeling like myself, how can I continue? Every day is a shade of the next and every night I can't help but dream of this dark shadow of a man who sees me for who I am and wants to celebrate me and be with me and just love me. I'm 16 and already a hopeless romantic who searching for a being that only exists within the painted imaginations of a storyboard. This is who I am, the Sam who wants to bleed, the Sam who likes black and red, the sad and tortured Sam who just wants to be Sam and noone else. And everytime I tell myself that It's Time and Sam is going to come out to play, something happens and my love for others pushes me farther inside myself. Farther in where I comfort myself and tell myself things will be alright. People have said that to me but it's been a long time since I've heard a reply similar to that that's fueld with honesty. If you want to fucking lie to me, then go ahead because I'm fucking lieing to you. I don't want to be here anymore than you do and I don't want to carry the world of others on my already sore and tired shoulders. If people would just leave me alone for awhile it would be a miracle. But no, it wouldn't matter anyway, what the fuck am I rattling on for? I know what will happen. The moment someone needs me I'm there, the moment someone is crying, I'm there, The moment someone is angry and needs to talk, I'm there. But when I need someone I turn to myself, When I am crying, I turn to myself, when I am angry and need to vent there's noone there but myself. It's nobody but me and that god damn fucking slice of silver steel and maybe that's the way things were meant to be. I hurt because I am being hurt, an eye for a fucking eye. I hate it here. But nobody really likes it here.
