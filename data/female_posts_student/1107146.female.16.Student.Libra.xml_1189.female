Well... try to have a good one and if not.....I'll try to make it on the 17th wish YOU and better one.........What do you want...I have to go get Erika and Amanda something...so you might as well telll me since I'm not really good at guy presents...unless you really want a dress for you birthday.....that reminds me I HAVE to get that picture developed.....O:-)  Hey...anyone going to see Becky this weekend? How is she? Ready for a beheading? I'm not mad I promise.....Ok so I am. I'm just so sick of being the worst friend to her. The friend that steals all her other friends, the friend that is "jealous" of her boyfriend, the friend that sneaks behind her back......Ok that isn't me. I'm just so sick of that running through her head. What heck....maybe becuase we have common friends she thinks I'm stealing them....maybe though there is a reason......just maybe. Bet the second one. WTF. How in the world can i be jealous of some one I don't know. You all know that used to hold one guy above the rest (no groans please) and I doubt I would just settle to have a boyfriend like Becky so I don't know where that curve ball came from. Then about sneaking behind her back....of course I did. At that time I trusted Philip more. He's the kind of person that wouldn't give a crap about if so and so liked him unless he liked them back. He wouldn't treat them any differently.....and I also knew that he's shy of the girls he really likes so...if he had really liked Becky then by me telling him...he would have made his move. Unfortunately he didn't like her and they still remained friends....oh wait I stole him from her....nevermind that I knew him first. Bleh....and eventually I did tell her....thanks Linds. Then the Pechenko thing....ok whatever Becky, you already tired me out with the like love or I hate Phil routine so whatever you want to do. Then you pop Michael on me.....um ok good luck i hope you two fare well. Twoo weeks later, Rosie!! I hate him. He's to clingy...he worships me too much......um....ok then tell him to not worship me...but I don't know what to do.....Well then, just tell micheal what you want.....i don't know how....@.@ do you mind if I do then since i don't want to hear about this anymore...ok, finally i don't care if you talk to my boyfriend....um ok... BLAH I WANT TO TEAR HER APART. Now she blames me for tearing her and micheal apart.......bleh....when she got back together with him i told her to make sure that she wanted michael not just a boyfriend...and she said ok. So well hoped they had good luck. then a week later she says she hates his guts.......@.@ again....well tough it out...do what you want to...... And now it's my fault she broke up with the boyfriend she hates....but wait she didn't tell me her TRUE feelings about him....so she's been lying to me............so it's between bad and worse.......And the problem isn't that....it's that she doesn't know how the hell to treat her true friends.....sorry becca but almost every senior hates you. Erika thinks you're annoying. pedchenko (junior) thinks that you are a annoying and needs to grow up. Matt thinks you're melodramatic. CrazyChicken thinks that you're annoying.......um....yeah.....he really does but you aren't stupid so he puts up with you...i got that out of matt......really becca... think about it...all the whining you do and all the dramatics really don't get you anywhere with them....really...try acting like you can talk without whining.....yes i do whine but I do know when to stop and it's never about the SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER....it adds variety....you on the other hand......it's calculus this caluculus that....do I need to remind you that you CHOSE to take that class........really you did... i'm not joking. Plus all that work you out into it....guess what, NO ONE DOES THAT MUCH AND THEY STILL GET AS MUCH OR BETTER THAN YOU........really... calculus should be a major part but not til 12am every night...you're going to kill yourself. Really....oh and learn to use your brain as you use your mouth...you NEVER tell your friends that as soon as you've lost the weight you're going to switch over to the popular group. DON'T BLAME YOUR DESIRE TO BE ACCEPTED ON OUR FAULTY TREATMENT OF YOU.....we treat you as one of us....really we do....and ravenwood....go join them ....really please do....you can go take my spot so that way you can have friends that accept you.....but let me tell you.....that opening door thing, and the rapt attention will fade....sorry that we can't worship you like they do.........once you said that I was your best girlfriend.....after philip and pedchenko...sorry to bust your bubble but you've been getting on phil's nerves for the past 2 months and pedchenko....did he ever really like you...(hint: he doesn't say you're annoying because he's flirting with you, I promise) and ...well with me you're on the bottom of the list since Xi is starting to realize what that we're both wrong...I'm not saying that I've done everything right but I have been trying to tell the truth and be a friend.......how ofter have you mislead me......remember when you said that you wanted to build a sister relationship with me since your real sister was such a dud.....sorry not happening......we can't... we're TOO different. I have a balance that I'm happy with . I have my education and I have my friends....true some are the nicest but guess what...they actually care and if they have a problem they let you know. I've been dropping hints that maybe you might want adjust somethings that you do......honestly with no bias in this statement.....very few people can really like for long periods of time. You're loyal and have many great qualities but some of the awful ones are well......i just can't stand them.........really.......
