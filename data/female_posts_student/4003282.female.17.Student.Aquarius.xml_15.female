But I don't think it's  right.       Band was alright. David was all looking down my shirt. It was  funny . I couldn't stop laughing. I don't think anyone could. We're going to have a party at my house. Before school starts. It's gonna be the end of the  summer  bash. Yepperz.      I'm gonna go call  Josh . I  miss  him s0o0o much.         L  a  t e  r   D  a  y  z
