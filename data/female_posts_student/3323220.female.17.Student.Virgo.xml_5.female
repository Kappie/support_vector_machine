I was quite distracted when the cake arrived. I even glanced at it 2 or 3 times. I didnt notice the mistake. It was ard 2plus when I went to check on the design of the cake dat I found out..MY MISTAKE!!! The cake doesnt haf the drawings on top. OH MY GOD! The customer emphasized dat the drawings must be there. And he is coming to pick it up in another 30 mins. Quickly, I told my supervisor. We managed (luckily!!!) at the last minute to get a new one done for the customer. At first when it seem impossible, as the time wasnt enough to make a new one, we called the customer to explain. We even offer to compensate them wif the cake dat they wanted on another day...and take tis cake 1st. The customer was very angry. (Actually is a couple la..the cake was for their daughter's 4th birthday) I apologised to the customer many times..but he insisted on having the cake been done. No matter wat. His wife said dat their daughter has been asking abt the cake since morning. Y was there such error? To say frankly, it's both the fault of mine  the kitchen chef. I didnt write where they could see "Artwork..". Artwork means the drawings on the cake. The chef oso didnt look PROPERLY. Sighs! I was so scared..need to ask me buy the 3kg cake. $100plus leh..somemore it's Blackforest..I can eat until I sick ar. Luckily wif the help of my supervisor, colleague  the kitchen staff, I managed to settle it. Still feeling guilty, I went to POPULARI went home to bath (after work). Bought a card and decorate it..planning to give the customer. As a way of apologising..to show it in a sincere way. I even made card for my supervisor, colleague  the kitchen staff. Haha! Ok..wif the bad comes the good thing. Actually not reali gd la..but it's gd compared to the cake incident. A person frm Ngee Ann Poly called me when I reached home (to bath). She ask me whether I benefited from the financial assistance provided by Ngee Ann Poly. (She talking abt the rental of notebooks) I jzu say "Ya" Den she says CHANNEL NEWSASIA is doing an interview on this. She says only selected students can be interviewed by them. She ask me if I'm interested. Of coz I was tempted..but den..I camera-shy la. HAHA! Not reali la...juz dat..the tot of my frds  relatives and all saw me on TV..I'm like..."Oh no!" Hee..I'm not photogenic enough too. Lol...lack confidence in front of mirror.
