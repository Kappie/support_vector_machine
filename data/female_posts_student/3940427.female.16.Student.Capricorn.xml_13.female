Anyway, it was Cody, Julia, Jorie, Spencer, and of course, myself. It was just hysterical. We spent the majority of the time playing word games. We had to go to the store to get hotdogs and the second Cody walked in, she asked: "What did we come here for?" XD ...Oh, and Spencer ripped Jorie's shirt. OO;; Don'task.  Most Hilarious Quote of the Night: "We're speaking in sentences!" -Cody  It was awesome. We have GOT to do that again before the end of summer vacation.  Okee, on to other matters...  CORGI PUPPIES!! They're due this week! I'm so excited!! I can't take it!! WHEEEE!! *bouncebouncebounce* They're going to arrive any day now!! ^-^ I hope there's a red and white female, I'd prefer a R female... But, I'm not going to be too choosy. As long as I get a corgi, I'll be happy. ^^  Okay, shuttingupnow.
