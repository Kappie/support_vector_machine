I guess though, I really should say that I dont know what to do with my parents. I found out that Cierra is dating a black guy..and I guess she's changing. I dont want her to change. I love her so much. Although, I haven't talked to her in a really long time..so I dont know. Everything is fine in my life until I start thinking about her again. Shit.  Anyhow, Im supposed to go to Bills but I wont talk to my dad because he's a fucking dick head bastard and my mom wont drive anywhere because she's lazy and never wants to drive me anywhere anymore. AHHH! I want to be out of this house. Fuck..I have to go.
