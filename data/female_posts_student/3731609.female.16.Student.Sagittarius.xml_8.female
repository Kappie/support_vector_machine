I was really surprised, she writes beautifully, poetically. I never knew those things about her. As I read I could picture her exactly, even as a young girl she appeared 30 because that was how I knew her. I tried fitting in what I knew of her sisters into the story, but then got lost in the words. I enjoyed it.   I was reading someone's journal and a question posed was, what is the best feeling? The girl answered something about family, which I respect, and trust me, I love my family, but after reading the question I immediately thought of an actual feeling. I absolutely love it when an airplane is landing. The wheels touch down and everyone's head jerks slightly at the impact. Then you lean forward your hips straining against the seat belt as you hurtle what seems like thousands of miles per hour, the wings upturned in an attempt to slow the plane down. That is my favorite feeling.   On another, non-similar note, I went to Ohio today and yesterday to visit my brother. We went to a baseball game (Indians/Tigers) and visited the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I was just telling my friend that I don't really enjoy baseball, and I'm not the biggest fan of halls of fame, but I had a fantastic time. I could be sitting in a field with my brother and my dad and have a good time.   Oh...now to try to get to bed.
