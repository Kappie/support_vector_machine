(?) for 25p! Wow huh?! Yeah cool! And... guess what? I'm spider man! I got my face painted and now I look... well stupid as normal but I'm spider man people! S-P-I-D-E-R M-A-N! (I'm sure they know how to pronounce it) Well I don't know how to spell so HA! (That doesn't work!) Owchie, I need to itch but I can't! One good thing about having a red face is that is covers for you if you go read! I'm ready to take on the world now! And oooh I won bowling! :P We also went on scary shooting games! God, the Juarassic Park one is soooo scary! Izzy left me all alone on it! :'( We also went on the stupid rowing one that we were rubbish on! We got nowhere! Owchie... has any one written on a book about how to scratch you face if it's covered in face paint that you don't want to smudge? Thought not... worth a try though! (Not really...) So how is every one? Well... I've seen Izzy every day for like ages... AAARGH! Get me out of here! So hey, every one tell me when you're coming back from holiday or going ok? Did any one else get this weird video thing from Berti...? Just thought I'd ask bubi!
