I am sleepy My hair is frizzy And a little bit curly And I would like to go to sleep But it's a tad too early see? Please put your arms around me And maybe I will have sweet dreams I swear I need that more now Then I ever have before   Hah so yeah that sucks. What can I say? I start to make up lyrics in my head to songs when I am this sleepy.....It's true though...especially about the hair!...Jeez, I am having a bad hair day today.  I've been in such a Dashboard Confessional Emo mood latley. I've been listening to "Hands Down" NON-STOP. It's such a nice song though. I'd like that to happen to me :)...But as my previous post replys that I really shouldn't be wishful anymore cause it just ends up hurting in the end. And that is such a typical teenage girl thing to say. Aww it's so romantic I want that to happen to me. No, Ok, I just want the good feelings to happen to me, not the shitty romantic stuff, cause that stuff makes me laugh. I mean...can you imagine the conversations after the big romantic move? God, they must be awkward. "So uh...that was a nice loud song you sang to me with the flowers asking to marry me all lined up and all."..."Um..yeah thanks. It took me awhile to find a good florist."...."Oh really, what florist did you get? I hope you got the cheap one, the other one is a rip off."..."Why, yes actually I did get the cheap one, got quite a bargian on it!"..."Oh that's nice. We always want to save our money."  Yes that conversation is just filled with passion and love for each other. Or like a week later the bill comes for like the airplane in the sky saying "I love you"..."DAMNIT! I can't afford this!"...."But honey, our love will pay for it. Our love can salvage anything.." .."CRAM IT! where the hell am I supposed to get 500 bucks??"....  So yes...GOOD FEELINGS FOR ME. No extra other stuff. But I am not really going to be picky. cause...Has either happened to me?.....Yeah but I am not complaning cause single life is quite the life for me at the moment. ........................Whether you belive that is sarcasim or not you can decide :)  Whatever, I guess I would have to LIKE someone for all of this now wouldn't I?....And no comments from that part of the mind, thank you very much.  Bleh, whatever I am only 16. I'm not expecting to find my true love or any love at all at this age. Cause....I am 16. And all boys want is sex at this age. And I am definitly not going to comment on that. But then again, since no one has..........then no one would want to.........me. HAH. I love my blanks.  Ok I swear to god, I just need to end this now. Just digging myself a grave at this point.  ..........................................................................  So it turns out most people's advisories are different. This pisses me off. Advisory last year at one point was the only GOOD PART OF MY DAY. And I still have yet to have any classes with anyone I know. ...Or stand. Yup, this year sucks already. And I am going to get sucky lunches cause every singal year I do. I have yet to have a good lunch. And if I don't have Mrs. MacGuire again for advisory I'll flip, cause I liked having gym teachers for advisory! I got off easier in gym class!!!!!! ....Damnit.damnit.damnit.
