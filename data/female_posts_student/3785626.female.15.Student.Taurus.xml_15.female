I woke up at 6 because I had to watch my mom, while my dad and Chris went to Holmes to help register for his college schedule and what not. I'm stuck at home making sure mom doesn't wander off or get too upset or whatever. Anyways I mowed the grass too, which wasn't that hard. It was at like 8:30 in the morning. So anywho, I took a shower and then called Aunt Betty because Mom was getting a little too upset. So she came over, we went by her house got some stuff, went by the store and got some stuff. The bagboy tried to hit on me. I walked into the store and he goes "Hey" or whatever so I do the whole "Whaddup nod" thing because I have no clue who the heck he is...I don't talk to strangers. Anyways walking around the store I see Beauty (Tregory's lil niece) and his sister. Beauty is so cute and loves Tregory. Anyways I was walking out of the store and the dude goes,"Hey um...I was wondering..." And see I thought he knew my brother or something...then all of a sudden..."Would you mind if I get your number?" I said, "Uhhh...YEEEAH!?" And I thought I think Tregory would mind too....Anyways we got home made lunch and dinner, then Tregory came over about 11. Then Aunt Betty left around 11:45, and I told Tregory to leave but come back. Lol, so he did. Yay. Now I'm really tired. Oh well. This day was fun because I got out of the house. So laters. Hoola instead of Holla.
