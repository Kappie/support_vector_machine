It all happened after Ryan received a phone call  I callously grabbed the phone off him. But mini-me was not enough, measured against this big friendly giant, as some would say. So Coleen being the loyal friend she is, jumped in for my sake. So bear with I  metally picture what is happening. It was all jam-packed action from then on! As I scooted across my lounge room with the phone hurrah! And locked myself in the bathroom. Yet this big friendly giant sadistically shoved the bathroom door against I which impelled Coleen to save I again! She bravely pinned the big friendly giant to the floor whilst I throughly checked the phone for any interesting materials. To my amazement, the falls, scratches  bruises were not all quite worth it. Nothing, nothing at all existed in the phone.  Placing that aside, with the background ensembling the quiet sounds of Can't Hardly Wait, we plunged into a deep  meaningful conversation. At least we tried to. Ever have a talk with Ryan? He get's totally sidetracked sometimes that a 10 minute conversation becomes a two hour one. Interestingly enough, we three managed to 'come clean' with each other, delving into secrets untold  what not. We even managed to reminisce about..hahahaha..my apologies but I will make this section into a *forbidden forest.* Oh joy! They attempted to teach I how to rollerblade but no success there. hehehe oh my two bestest friends in the world! hahaha isn't it ironic how that came about? oops *forbidden forest* hehehehe  -- lackin mentality --
