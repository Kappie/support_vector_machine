Instead of being all pissy at guys and talking about them and making them look bad, I should be that woman who highlights their good points. I could talk about a lotta good points for my guy friends, and about guys I hate right now (and believe me, I hate a lotta them right now) so I guess I will apologize first. I'm sorry, Don, paul- whoever you are... I'll just call u Don Pablo today :D for bein that bitch to rat you out. I'm sorry Harrold, for ruining something, but I'm not sorry for busting you out because she is a good friend of mine you sleaze. I'm sorry Jay, for being a bitch all the time... I know I am one and you cant convince me otherwise. Okay... I have this friend... he's pretty nice and he looks good- my roomies wont stop talking about him, but what do you do when things are strictly platonic and you have no interest in making them different? I have had crushes on my friends lots of times, but I eventually get over it. Most of the time I dont even tell them because I would rather have them as a friend than ruin a friendship. I've done it too many times already. I had to find out the hard way that one of my guy friends is nothing but a perv and he wants nothing but a piece of ass- and that's why he was being so nice to me. How did I know? He freaked out the minute I told him I seriously liked him and has been acting crazy since. I guess... I'm just like, scared of the rejection that follows an announcement like that. Right now I cant even begin to want to be in a relationship because I still love somebody and he doesnt and will never feel the same. I should get over it, right? That takes a long time. I'm not really ready to give it up yet, y'know? It's like, I spend my whole life trying to be this wonderful person. I apologize to Shimron, because I bit his head off for telling me I was dependent. I am very independent, but I depend on that male companionship to keep my life sane. I'd rather have it in the form of a friend than nothing at all... I guess it's a bit of growing up on my part that I've learned to accept things for the way they truly are. I dont approach guys anymore because I dont think i'm the hottest pancake on the stove and I definitely have good self-esteem, but I'm very realistic. I've been shot down before and we all know how that feels. Not very good at all. I'm cute... but not cute enough to be concieted, therefore I let guys approach me and by the looks of the guys that do, I must not be very cute to them. And the shit they say is downright insulting sometimes, but I try really hard to have patience and just smile and say hi to em. I got a test in like, half an hour. I'm out.
