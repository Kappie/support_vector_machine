Almost everything she says here is exactly how I feel, but I didn't know how to say it. Even if I did, I know I couldn't have done it as eloquently as she. It's startling how much of this I feel. The only part that doesn't really apply to me is the actress part, and not remembering you. I  will  remember you. I can guarantee you that. And I do need you to remember me.    The sad thing is, I really have no idea who I am, what I want to be. I write these long posts about what I want, what I desire in life but really, I am so caught in limbo that it’s not even funny. I’m a walking contradiction: the girl who remembers what her teacher was wearing the last day before spring break in second grade, but forgets to empty her trash can; the brutally honest dreamer; the actress who cries genuinely. I can’t even decide what I want for dinner tomorrow, much less decide what I want to spend the rest of my life doing. I want to do something that makes people adore me. I want to do something that makes lots of money. So, I want to be an actress. It just so happens, that I’m good at it. I invest all of myself into who I portray on stage. I get so involved that each time I finish a role, each time I finish a monologue, a little part of me leaves.   I am a wonderer—if that’s a word. I wonder about anything and everything. I sit in my bed, surrounded by pillows and empty cups of tea, and wonder while the world passes me by. I wonder if I’ll even remember that I kept this journal, wonder if I’ll even remember where I’m living right now. Remember how it smells and how it looks and what television shows I watched on empty summer mornings. I wonder if anything will ever be important. I make changes without changing anything. I think without thought. I’m constantly at odds with the world. I envy people who can make concise decisions because I cannot. Long after, I have made my choice; I sit in my bed, surrounded by empty cups of tea and wonder if it made a difference. I am fragile and delicate—or at least that’s what I’d like to believe. Once, someone told me that I was and I thought long and hard after. Once again, I am a thinker who doesn’t think. Nothing ever results from my thoughts.   And I want love. I ache for love. I want someone who loves me dearly and 2.5 kids and a house in Greenwich and the whole shebang. I want a big happy family and an airy kitchen and beautiful, intelligent children who cling to their mother’s leg. I want beauty. I want a face so pretty that it makes people sigh and wrists so fragile that people stare.  I am a walking contradiction, and even though in ten, twenty years, I will not remember you; I need you to remember me.
