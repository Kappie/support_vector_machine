I am not complaining, but I hate to see my  beloved  brother hogging the computer even if he is not in the house! How does he do it? Easy. He is currently obsessed with an online game where he is always in a stupid place with so many people carrying 'steaming pots' on their heads! And then he inserts a cheat code and there, his points increased without him being present, and so does my anger! Okay, enough of ranting on and on... I just surfed Volks's website and they have released two SDs where only the highest bidder on their annual Dolpha Show will receive them. Hiaz...
