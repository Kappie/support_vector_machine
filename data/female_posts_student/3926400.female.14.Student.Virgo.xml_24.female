Tonite after work some guy followed my to my sisters house and was hollering out the window at me. then he turned around and did it again! I was sooo scared. if my brother wouldnt have came outside I would have called the cops! When I left to go home I had my cell phone in hand so I could call on the drop of a dime!! Well Ill see yall prolly tuesday.. lol maybe! Have a great weekend yall! -Me
