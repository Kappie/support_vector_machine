Something random that can create illusions that soon become taunting in what you see. I thought I saw him but got some distorted image of what I thought was true. : : :Thought it was better but see something worse.: : : I saw something worse and I hated it dearly. Made me want to stab something with my pen, something chubby but not a human and not alive. . . I thought the distance had decreased, yet maybe that was just a dream. Well, let time pass and maybe it will finally decrease forever, or as long as it can.
