So, that fucking bitch Loreen moved out of here. And in moved all D's Newfie buddies. Cool... Maybe? Would have been the 3rd of this month I suppose, that D and I had plans. Well, he decided to fuck off on me with all his buddies that live downstairs. Yep, we had the plans. We were gonna drink and all that crap, and he ended up ditching me. I hate that when I get ditched. So, whatever, yea I was pissed of course. So, we made plans for LAST Saturday, (being the 10) It was cool. We went out for dinner, and had planned on getting some drinks and just havin one of those nights. Sex... You know, all that fun shit. But, something happened. Circumstances changed a little bit. His brother (because of the CAS) isn't allowed near his kids... But, J wanted to spend some time with Mar. So, I offered to take the kids so that they could spend some time alone without the kids around. But, there was a condition. Since D and I had made plans, I wanted them to pick the kids up at around 10 or so. They agreed to that, and kept the agreement. Well, 10:30, but no biggie. D and I still had plenty of time together. But, no. D wanted to get right on the beer right away, with the kids here and everything. So, he said to me at 10 "I'm gonna go downstairs for a bit, I'll be up in an hour." Whatever. He always says that. He was treating me like shit in front of the kids when he was here. So, I said to him "Well, remember our plans. You don't be back here at 11, you ditch me again for a secondweek in a row, then fuck off, and consider yourself single". So, he said "OK, I will be back I promise" and that was that. He never came back. Not till almost 5am. I told him if he didn't come back then not to bother. So, he didn't. Until 5. What in the hell is that supposed to say to me? "Piss on ya?" I would think so. So, I told him, "Fine, I'll let you in, but I'm single now". When he came back, hebrought back this weird guy with him. The week before (he lives in this building too) I met him, and he was 'jokingly' trying to kiss me. I'd never met him before. Truthfully I was rather creeped out by it. But anyway, when D came back last saturday at 5, this guy came with him. I was crying and everything. I was so angry, because I did in fact, after HIS nieces and nephew left, (yea HIS family, and he fucks off on ME) I spent the rest of the night by myself. So, I was upset, understandably so. So, I let the 2 of them in, so as not to make a big scene in the hallway, and D gave me one of those really nasty looks. I said to him "What, chu gonna go beat me up again?" (when D gets too loaded, he takes his temper out on me. Last year he lost it on me because I was laughing at him for falling on his ass... he almost killed me Literally) He just shook his head at me, and went to the bathroom. Then this guy he brought with him (the weird one) started talking to me at the table. He then said "I want to see you... Tomorrow night out front of the building 6:30". Um, yea ok there buddy, I thought. I was not attracted to this guy at all. I couldn't believe it. He is supposed to be one of D's best friends, doesn't know me from adam, and he wants to talk to me. Whatever, he's drunk, I thought. He'll forget about it, and I will too... I just took into consideration that the guy was loaded.  Next day, he comes over. Sober! Whispers to me "Silver Store at 8, don't wanna take a chance being meeting you out front of the building" Fuck! I thought. He remembered. So, not wanting to be mean, I showed up. Met up with my father too. And Deb. So, I told him I had to go for a beer with dad, and I would be back at the Silver at 830. And I was. So was he. We went down to the lake, and he took my hand and all he wanted was to just get to know me. And why I said what I said about D beating me up. So, we talked blah blah blah. Then we sat on a bench at the lakefront, and he started literally begging me to kiss him. I thought "Uh, no!" This guy was sooooooo not my type. I told him we could only be friends, no more no less. So, he told me to kiss him anyways and see if I felt anything lol. Unbelievable. So, whatever. I did, and I pulled away. I didn't feel anything. So, lol, he said "Try again". Still didn't feel nothing, so I suggested we go home. I promised myself forever that I wouldn't get involved in a situation like this, especially some guy that lives in my building. This is why I never did with M next door. Went home, called it a night, whatever... But then I kept thinking about him... and thinking and thinking, in fact, I couldn't stop! It was crazy. I wanted to see him again. When he hugged me, I felt warm, loved and safe, it was weird. See, when I parted with him that night, he asked me to meet him again the next night. I had no intentions. But I couldn't stop thinking about him for some really weird reason. I dunno. So, I kept on meeting up with him through the week. Just to talk and stuff. His kiss was soft and warm. We learned a bit here and there about eachother. He'sa total romantic. He's an amazing person. True. Real. Everything. So far anyway. He started working last week, so he asked if he could get my cell number in case he works late, he wants to call me and say goodnight. He told me he can't stop thinking about me. He said a lot to me. I'll continue tomorrow, I'm getting tired.
