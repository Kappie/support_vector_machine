UGH  I think a week of rest is in order...so thank goodness it is Spring break.  So anyway, I have been a little annoyed with Ed.  Only because he is such an intelligent person, but he has little or no faith in himself.  Therefore just settling on the idea that he isn't a great student.  Mind you, this guys has a 3.6 average.  He is so brilliant, I wish there were something I could do to make him realize that.  Maybe I am just going on and on because I know his potential and that he isn't making the most of the gifts he is blessed with.  I wish school came easy to me.  It used to.  I remember in high school, things just seemed to fall into place, but in college I have to bust my butt.  I currently have a C in Math, but am confident that I can finish that class with a B.  My English class I should be able to pull a B...and Oceanography I MAY be able to pull a C.  That class is a lot harder than you think, it has the chemistry, physics, geology, biology all tied into it.  So it is like taking all those classes at once.   Here I thought it would be easier.  I think I understood the Chemistry at UCSC more than I understand this stuff here.  Maybe I don't read enough.  I love school.  I think with all the stresses in my life, I just can't concentrate.  I wish more than anything someone would pay for my college and then I wouldn't have to worry about the financial aspect.  I know, wishful dreaming.  It is just so hard when you have to worry about the financial aspect.  I realized I am not so much a dreamer, but a realist.  I know my limits and it is sad because maybe I could achieve greater things if I didn't have the burden of financial woes.   Anyhow, I have a job interview to take pictures of people at Legoland.  Is it the job I had hoped for?  HELL NO!  But it is a job, I did get a call back and will have an interview, so at this point I cannot be choosy.  Life must go on and I must make ends meet here before we lose our home.  Well Emmy needs changing really bad...so maybe later today or next time...    Sidenote:    Thank you Heidi for the card.  It is special friends like you who remind people that life isn't that bad.  No matter what I may lose in life, I am confident that I will not lose my friendship with you.  Oh and by the way, Nalani still hasn't made the perfect picture to send to Cousin Sydney, although she thinks her Kuya's pictures look rather nice to send.  LOL  We miss you all.
