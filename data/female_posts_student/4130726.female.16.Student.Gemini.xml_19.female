I have aqua teen hunger force stuck in my head. No one has heard of it up here. I painted Tupac on the wall, like I did Kurt Cobain. I guess they look pretty good. I'll try to get a picture sometime. (LIE) Nothing new today. I called the tard school yesterday, but I don't know if I'm in. I don't know what to write about. Yesterday I wrote a lot. Nothing exciting happened. My watch was exciting this morning. On a long ride, I entertained myself by synchronizing my watch with the clock. I wrote a worksheet today. That's pretty fun. I printed it out. It was five pages long. I have a good band for you punk rockers, its called Billy Talent. Its also some comic book name. But its a good band. Go search for it on the internet. There might be a website with more information. Before I publish posts, I use spell check. Its pretty useful. I heard that muffins have a lot of calories. Like eggs, its in that category of foods that switch between healthy and unhealthy. I don't think potatoes are healthy, that's crap. I read an ad yesterday that tried to tell me that potatoes were healthy. I don't care, they have a but load of carbs. Doesn't meat have a high amount of cholesterol? Wouldn't the Atkins diet be high in cholesterol? I remember reading a nutrition label for ground hamburger, it had 30 something of cholesterol. I don't eat hamburger anyway. Cows eat their own kind. Their food is made from ground cow. I'm such a rebel, not eating cows and all. I haven't heard anything bad about chicken yet, so I eat chicken. I played this game at   urlLink  www.the-n.com    it was fun. Play it, its called avatar high. I like to make love triangles. I'm a sick person, but its fun controlling the fate of others. I know that you like it, Everyone does. You get scored on what you do, that's the suck part. You need a certain amount of points to do this and that. Hey, find some crazy web sites and tell me about them, I'm always up for that. Give me a URL so I can post it for others to see. I keep having this thought that there is a spider with a big butt that will explode if I squeeze it. I had a dream about it too. Some kid and I were squeezing spiders and making their butts explode. It is disgusting, I cant eat sometimes because of that thought. I mean, just think about it. Imagine a tiny spider with a big butt. Now squeeze its body/head and watch its butt explode. Its disgusting! I hate thinking about it! Just image many small and black and crawly things flying from the exploded spider butt! I think that the spiders are in my food sometimes. It sucks. My mind does crap like that to me because I have a huge imagination. Don't swim in water you cant see in. Watch aqua teen hunger force on adult swim on cartoon network late at night! That's when its on, usually 10 p.m. or later. On certain days too, Try Monday.
