But today was a really pretty bad day after that. i dont wanna bore with details. so ya. im so bored right now, im staying with my grandparents because all the rest of my family is out of town. so ya, its really boring, but im gonna go to bed cuz i have to babysit tomorrow for like, 8 hours! ahhh.  love espresso
