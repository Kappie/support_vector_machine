I mean, I think it needs to be said that there are so many people out there, opening their hearts, despite the possibility of breaking hearts, cheating or a failed relationship.  I think we should give it up to those people.  The kind of person who loves unconditionally, and leaps head first without checking to see if someone will catch them on their decent.  I am one of those people, and anyone who knows me for about 5 minutes knows that I've fallen to the point of no return.  It's all good.  He loves be back...but I know that sometimes I scare him with how much love I have.  I don't care, though, 'cause that's the kinda gal I am.  :-)  Here are some others:   urlLink Taylor Mali  spoke of one in his journal the other day... "...the highlight of the entire weekend for me (and most everyone else at Breadloaf) was listening to one girl's love poem. I double-dared her to read it directly to the boy at the conference who she was crushing on, and she did. In the dining hall. At dinner. Through a megaphone. Breathless and aflutter. Surrounded by 300 kids and faculty. By the end of the poem, everyone was standing up on their chairs as she walked to the dumbfounded boy, his dinner tray in his hands. Who was this girl walking to him with a megaphone reciting a love poem in front of this crowd? He must have thought it was a practical joke. But every step she took closer to him was another step out onto the thinnest part of the branch. And the branch will not break. When she was done, to the deafening cheers of encouragement, they embraced and ran out of the room. I didn't see them again"   George Michael sings in his latest release:  "Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise / The day you walked in and changed my life / I think it’s amazing / The way that love can set you free / So now I walk in the midday sun / I never thought that my saviour would come / I think it’s amazing / I think you’re amazing..."   Cyrano de Bergerac recited this to Roxane:  "All, all, all, whatever that came to me, e'en as they came, I'd fling them in a wild cluster, not a careful bouquet.  I love thee!  I am mad!  I love, I stifle!  Thy name is in my heart as in a sheep-bell, and as I ever tremble, thinking of thee, ever the bell shakes, ever thy name ringeth!"   That's what I'm talkin' about, people!!  Go on with your bad selves!
