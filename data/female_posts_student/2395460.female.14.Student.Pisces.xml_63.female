Sure it weighs just over an ounce, but it's just a 2 megapixel camera, and you can't add to the meager 128mb of built-in storage. That's less than a half hour of mpeg-4 video. It will, however, have the  urlLink Kopin CyberDisplay , about the size of a grain of rice, which when coupled with magnifying optics, can create a virtual display as clear and as accurate as a true optical image. Because the display is so very very teeny, it uses much less battery power than a full-sized LCD, very important when you're talking about a take-everywhere device.   I will not give in and buy the Philips Keycorder. I'm 50% sure of that.  Read more in the  urlLink Kopin Press Release .
