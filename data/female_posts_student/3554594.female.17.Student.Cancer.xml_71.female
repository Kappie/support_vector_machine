	 
      The Presence of Love in me  And in Life's noisiest hour, There whispers still the ceaseless Love of Thee, The heart's Self-solace and soliloquy.       You mould my Hopes, you fashion me within;      And to the leading Love-throb in the Heart      Thro' all my Being, thro' my pulse's beat;      You lie in all my many Thoughts, like Light,      Like the fair light of Dawn, or summer Eve      On rippling Stream, or cloud-reflecting Lake.  And looking to the Heaven, that bends above you, How Soft! I bless the Lord that made me love you.
