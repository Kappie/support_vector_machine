I don't take no crap from anybody else but you I wear the pants around here, when I'm finished with your laundry.... Cuz I'm a guy you don't wanna fight When I say "Jump" you say "Yeah, right" I'm the man of this house until you get home(he's the man! he's the man!) What I say goes around here, right out the window.... And I don't wanna hear a lot of whining, so I'll shut up The sooner you learn who's boss around here, the sooner you can give me my orders, dear Cuz I'm head honcho around here, but I follow my head(he's the man! he's the man!) And I can have sex anytime that you want.... Cuz I'm a man who has needs but they're not that important And don't expect any flowers from me cuz if I'm not mistaken you prefer jewelry I'm the king of my castle when you're not around(he's the man! he's the man!) And I'll drink and watch sports whenever I wanna get in trouble.... And I'll come home when I'm good and ready to sleep on the couch Cuz a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do And I'm gonna do what you tell me to  Because I'm top dog around here but I've been neutered(he's the man! he's the man!) You da man!
