There are people everywhere yet everything is completely silent, and this 14 point font might as well be screaming my words to the other patrons. The screen of this computer displays my innermost thoughts to all the people and goings on around me; meanwhile I can't see anything but the wall, leaving me totally absorbed in the fast click-clack of the keyboard that is noticeable (and probably annoying) to all. With this kind of anxiety I think I would make a terrible prisoner.   Anyway, it is good to write again. Writing is many things to me: it's my "me" time, my escape, my one (semi) talent, and it's my way of cleaning out the millions of wandering thoughts that muddle my overactive mind on a daily basis. I hope to return permanently the South Pacific soon.   Unfortunately my time is already up and it's back to my cell where I stare at the wall all day and try to dream of clever ways of escaping. I'm counting down the days until my release. Until then...tell my two readers that I'll be coming home soon (hopefully next week).
