His little bad butt is nothing like this anymore, but it's nice to think of the good old days when he was normal :D  Life  Theres something good to you Theats your Life Even though someday You will die  You Might go down To hell and cook Or go to heaven Obeying God is all it took  Life is the best to me Np matter which way the water flows Your life might be bad But thats how life goes  Living for al long time Is a very special gift Some people may die early But thats how life is  You Might Hate your Life You Might wish that you would die But a death wish is a bad thing To plant upon ones life  If you dont love your life You will never know who yu are In life you will Never get really far    By Maurice Johsnon
