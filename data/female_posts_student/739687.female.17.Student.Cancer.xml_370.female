God...but, this time, I have no one to be angry at but myself. I did this to myself, because I freaking suck and now I get to deal with the consequences. GOD, WHY?!?  I hate it...I'm in this infallible good mood, and I walk in the door, and bam. It's like...couldn't the news wait for when things sucked?  65. That's all I have to say. 65. SIXTY FREAKIN' FIVE!!  Screw it screw it. That's life, and it's my fault.  Well, now that I'm on this whole ranting thing...I'll just let it out.  You know what I hate? When people feel the need to announce to the world that THEY DON'T LIKE YOU. Guess what? No one gives a shit. I don't care who doesn't like me, unless they have a valid reason. But the truth...no one ever has a truly valid reason for hating anyone. Because the only people that give them reason to hate, they cling to. People are so weak. You hate the people you hardly know, that you never will know. Then what is this desire to announce it? My god, if I don't like someone, I don't go telling everyone. Stupid, childish little games people play. Oh well, only little people play little games, so that says alot for anyone who this so consequently refers to. No one in particular...everyone. Because every fool does it. I think it's pretty obvious when someone doesn't like me, but I prefer the demeanor of acting completely oblivious to it. "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer."  Some people have no strategy in life. No account of their actions, not a whim as to how what they do will affect who they will become- where their successes (or lack thereof) will unveil. For most of you, I wish nothing but failure. Note that most people I wish such failure upon are probably too ignorant to read this anyway, so I suppose chances are, if you're reading this, then no harm done, all the more power to you. But to those of you who show no regard for your actions...please. Get a head on your fucking shoulders, grow up just a little bit quicker, and lose your ego/attitude/demeanor or whatever it is that makes you such a fucking dumbass.  Ughh, now I'm stressed. This is overwhelming. God, I want to throw up.  Well on to more ranting, since, well...Oh, I suppose I'll get over it. Pick up my pride and all the pieces that have shattered, and I'll get it over with. But for now, I just need to be really really pissed off.  You know what else I hate?  People who only come and go with your emotions. Not all...just the ones who are only there when you are at your lowest. I don't understand why people see those people as such blessings. Why do we feel so damn grateful for people who are there to support us when we fall down? That come to our side (though never in any other occasion) and guide us through our dark moments. They offer an ear, their advice, their support, when we are in trouble/trauma/drama...  God, I hate those people. No one sees it...they just feed off of your weaknesses. Something inside them enjoys lifting you up, like they're some sort of hero. Everyone just wants to be important, and heroic. Please. Go save a fucking whale. They're like crutches. People who make it seem as though you NEED their words, their support and commitment to you, to make it through. But as soon as you're alright (sooner than later, people have such shifty moods...and drama is a facade that drifts in and out on a whim of attention), they disappear. Leave you to your lives as normal...they basically don't give a shit unless you're miserable. Stand on your own two feet, believe me, you'll need them if you ever want to walk alone.  Then again, how few people can actually perform such a feat. To walk on one's own is..unimaginable. Because everyone has a crutch. Most people enjoy the comfort and support of a crowd, of their drama-heroes.  Stand on your own. Don't praise the people who wipe your tears, but never share in your laughter. They're dark, mental, twisted fools who will never make much of themselves, but rather, feed off of the sadness of other.  I suppose, all in all, my only complaint, really, besides (65) is that people are weak, foolish, blind, oblivious....oh and really blatantly stupid.  It's all people. People people people. Ughh. Okay, it's not all people...it's just the ones who get in my way. And not all who I cross paths with...just the ones who can't think on their own or grow up or something.  Yarghh. whyyyyy???  Okay okay okay...I'm sorry, I'm not so cheerful, not like I was this morning or this afternoon or this evening or right before I walked in the door.  Alright I work tomorrow. And I've got lots of shit to worry about.  GOD SOMETIMES THINGS JUST SUCK REALLY REALLY BAD.  Well, crazies...be smart...and shut up in the theater okay?
