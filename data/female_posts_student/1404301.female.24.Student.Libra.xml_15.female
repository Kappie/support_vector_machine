Sydney is approximately 2000 km North-East from Adelaide, the different modes of transport available are:  - the bus: foget it, last time Dylan spent 35h trying to fall asleep because there wasn't enough room for his tall legs!  - the plane: S.O.S.! we are both scared of flying!  - the train: haaa...here we go...12h on a train (yeah...it's not like the TGV! 50 km/h!!), sleeping on a seat with a blanket to keep warm...but the view is extraordinary! We get to cross the wild scenery between South Australia and New South Wales.  You can go to the web site of the  urlLink Australia's Great Train Journeys  to get some more information. There are only 2 trains per week, one thing is sure, we won't miss it!!
