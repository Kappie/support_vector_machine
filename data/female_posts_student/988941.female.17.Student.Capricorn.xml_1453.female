I did however buy Joss Stone's new album.  very cool.  I got The New Breed as well, proper bo. Searching for drumming lessons, found one in warlingham and one in croydon, prices are VERY high, so I'm basically being as tight as a fat mans pocket and going for the cheapest one! I stink so im gonna go shower! chat soon ya?
