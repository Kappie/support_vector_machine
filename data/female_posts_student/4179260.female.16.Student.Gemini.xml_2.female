(haha... i am sooo  tempted  to say more abt her but nope, its okay...i still DO have my moral values like = loyalty.. but obviously she does not hav it). suddenly everyone wants to know the blog's add, what i said abt you know who and how she reacted to it. yes, by now i am very sure she has been here.. welll well well, someone even saw her opening my page in class.. ;) publicity does wonders (*hint*)  am i mad at her cause she's calling me a bitch behind my back because of the previous entry? nope, in fact im   thrilled  ...at least she knows the truth, i know i for one would not want to live my life knowing my "friends" were terrible. i am trying to fix something here am i not? :)  here's a list of what she said about me behind my back. resources remain anonymous... :)   1. that i do not deserve to be a H.O.D in the prefectorial board      2. that i want to do everything in the drama (helloo, am i or am i not the director? i give   instructions, you follow. dumbass)
