It's nothing fancy, but a simple attack, earn money, buy weaponry game where you play characters similar to Lord of the Rings. I know it sounds boring, but what are you doing with your time, eh?? If you sign up, it helps me out even, and you all get to be part of my army! woot!  Ahh, the simple joys in life. I suppose this is what I get; me not studying for finals means me finding alternate interests online. Entertaining, right. I am super worried for my Trig final becuase my grade is *right* on the edge, and I would need a high A to raise it... and, well, that's not happening. Fuck. Oh well.  For tomorrow: Yes, let's lunch it!! I'll be fine with any form of edibility tommorrow even, so you don't even have to fret about that... Just fricken' choose and I will abide by it! haha. Yeah I sound like a little bitch!!  OH and Billy... Si, estoy los pantalones rosas de Brian.
