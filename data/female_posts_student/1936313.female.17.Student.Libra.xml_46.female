Social exam Pt.A tomorrow, wish me luck I've forgotten what Reagonomics and Thatcherism is! (No not really... they drilled that through our skulls rather painfully) Hooray for more essays! -sarcasm as usual-  I found out today that Steven got married over the weekend instead of going to grad. -THAT- is crazy.... whats crazier is He didn't freaking tell me.... (My fault.. I think I shoulda clued in when I saw him in Ben Moss with his girlfriend, maybe?)... so there.. I'm not even graduated and 2 of my friends are (getting) married. Backwardsness.  I have that new Cherie song "I'm Ready" stuck in my head, I suppose its a good enough summer song! Addicting at least, I'll eventually get sick of it!     I'm moving out there, So baby beware, because now its just a matter of time Before my fast cross, and the sky falls, The very monent that i tell you, you're mine.  I'm Ready, Come and find me, I'm not gonna hide, I got the sun on my side, It's heavy, 'cause I'm finally Open for the woman, I'm Ready, Ready. I'm Ready for Love.     aand Katie just called so I'm going t'help her with her 10 page assignement for Cr.Wr... which reminds me that I should be working on mine. Blah. Work.
