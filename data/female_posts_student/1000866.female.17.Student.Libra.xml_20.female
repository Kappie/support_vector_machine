I went to the park today, because I really needed to think about some stuff and be alone, and, it's the best place I know of to do that. Plus, it wasn't THAT cold. So, yeah, I went to the park with my music, and swung on the swing while listening to music. Kinda makes me feel carefree. Ah, I love it! Anyway, so, I'm sitting there, not bothering anyone, just minding my own friggin' business.and suddenly...WHAM!!! This big wet gob hits me in the back. I was like...what the..? So, I frantically look around, and I see a bunch of kids standing behind me making snowballs. So, I'm like...fine, they must have hit me on accident. What weieners! So, I shook it off and went back to listening to music when suddenly...WHAM! Right in the back of the head. Arg. So, I turn my music off, turn around and say, "What do you guys think you're doing?" They answer, "throwing snowballs at you." I say, "Why," and they say, "Because you're on our gangs territory." OK...so, this is getting a little annoying (they're still throwing snowballs at me during this) and I say, "What are you guys..like, 5?" And they're like, "No! We're 9!" So, I just turn my music back on and go back to listening, and they keep throwing snowballs at me, and when I tell them to stop, they say, "what, are you gonna call your mommy? Haha!" So, I put up with it for a bit longer, and then ask the, "gang leader" what his name is. Mark Gianopolis, or something like that, and I tell him I'm going to call his mother. This, for some reason did not scare him. Heck, if some older kid told me that when I was 9, I would have piddled my trousers and ran away!  Whew, new paragraph, the other one was getting too long. Anyway, so....this kid actually CHALLENGES me about the mom thing. I would call his mom too if I thought that this Mark kid didn't get his terrible attitude and manner from her. Arg, I dislike most Naperville people's attitudes. Pooey. Well, anyway, finally, I just got so sick of their little, "gang" that I decided to scare them off. I told them that technically, this was assault and battery, and that I could call the cops, and have them deal with the situation. I told them it was a felony, and guess what?? They BELIEVED me! I was like...yes, small impressionable minds. So...they trudge off all confused, and I go back to my music, and thinking and whatnot, and they come back a few minutes later, and go, "We have something to tell you." So, I say, "What?" And they go, "We're sorry, we thought you were just another high school kid who was going to be mean to us, and take over our territory." I go, "Well, you do know this is public property?" And the little kid says, "No, my dad built the park! It's our territory!" And then he apologized again and left. Oh, and this is great...after a little while more, they yell to me, "you know, you can come on our territory now." Psh.  As funny as it is, and as much as it made me laugh, it also made me incredibly sad. To think...little Naperville kids, doing this to people. They're like a mini-gang. No, they aren't going to seriously injure someone with a snowball, but still, jeez, what is this fricking world coming to?? I'm sick of it. Even in Naperville now, which I thought, even though it's a snob town, at least it's safe. Wow, that really does make me sad.  Well, until then, my day was pretty ordinary. Except for the bananas on the lockers. Haha, it was SO great, SO funny. It made my day, and like...no one noticed at first glance, and then they realized...whoa...wait....bananas??  We did opur presentation in American Government, which was fun. I think we did a good job actually!  was happy with it. Ummm....poor Scott, his Grandpa died. I really feel so bad for him. I know how that feels, and, it's a terrible feeling. I didn't want to bring up winter, even though I really needed to find out what was going on. I just felt so rotton for him. Poor Scott. :( Scott...here's a smiley for you! :) You're the coolest kid!  Diane was there this morning, but, she wasn't there by 3rd hour chem, so, I think she may have left. I really hope she's feeling better. I feel like I may have jinxed her. The day before she got sick, we were talking about how she never really gets sick with a fever and stuff, and how she hasn't missed a day of high school yet, and...the next day. Wow...irony. It's amazing.  Speech was kind of sad today. Ms. V was telling us about herself, and her personal life, and Will accidentally said something that he shouldn't have, and Ms. V seemed to get upset. Eek...it was a REALLY uncomfortable moment, REALLY uncomfortable.   We got the newspapers today, and they had a retraction about the use of the term, "band dorks,  but no retraction about Julia telling the incident. I think that's perfectly logical. If she really saw it, then she does have a right to tell it. I certainly don't think it was appropriate, or necessary, and...supposedly she did just do it to get back at band kids, although I can't prove that. I still think the article was good, and that, honestly, if she really did see what she says she saw, then we have no right to stop her from saying it.   Oh crap! I was supposed to call Kathryn back...more later...yikes....
