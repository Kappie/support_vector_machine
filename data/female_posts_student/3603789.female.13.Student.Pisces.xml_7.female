But then they hear about the waaaay smaller amount of Americans and then they're all "How horrible!" Pissedpissedpissed.  Ah... did you really post that at 3 in the morning, or has Garrett not figured out how to put us in Eastern yet?  Check  urlLink this  out. It's Susumu Hirasawa, a Japanese musician. This is his site against the Iraqi war. You can download a couple of really beautiful/sad songs. (Also check out his main site, there is more mp3 goodness to be found there.) Of course, it is in Japanese, but they have translations. Very pretty.  Maybe I should change my username to perpetually_pissed.
