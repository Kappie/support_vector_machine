I hate doing that and I do it all the time I focus on all the bad things that sux and you know you only look at the bad because its like you feel like you have done nothing in the simple years that you have lived so you feel that all this time you have accomplished nothing so you look at what you think will be your present and you see yourself ending up like your parents and you freak out! you just straight out freak so you start doing the things that you would like to be doing but youre so scared of doing because if you do them people look at you and think your crazy-though secretly they wish they could have the guts you do and if ever they do them too-but they dont because everybody is scared of everybody! Have you ever noticed how a group of people revolve around one person if you look at that person you see how everybody worships her/him, how everything is supposed to be their way so if you dont do what they say they see you as a threat to them so they turn and give yu the cold shoulder kind of sux because later on their not going to have anybody and you will be the only one who will be there but you'll look back and you return the favor as once they did to you! it really sux i guess well that is it see ya laters                              PinkKitty Chaos
