Its been a while since we have been able to talk about life and its mysteries. We ran up hill for 3.5 miles turned around and ran back. Even though the first half was  all up  hill, it wasn't nearly as bad as I had first imagined. Then we ran around my complex its about 1 mile around. It took us 1:23 to finish the run. Faster than I did the 8 on Saturday with my group. I wonder if it was because I was talking and enjoying the run or if it was because half of it was downhill. I like to think it was both!  I saw a license plate frame and I don't' really understands what it meant. I was wondering if you would know. The top part of the frame read "runners only" the bottom of the frame read "miserable". I took a double glance to make sure I read it right and I did. I don't' get it. Anyway I am going to do an easy 3 tonight to keep my legs from tightening up.  Have a great run
