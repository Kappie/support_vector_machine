Maybe someone else understands these things and can clue me in?   *Pop up adds for software to eliminate Pop ups. Isn’t this blackmail??? Basically they are telling you that you have to buy their product to get rid of a problem they are causing or else you will continue to be harassed. This would be like some guy walking up to you and hitting you repeatedly until you agreed to buy his service as a bodyguard to protect you from people hitting you…  *The auto-glass people calling me to ask if I have a cracked or dinged windshield that I want repaired. If I wanted their services, I would call them. Do they believe that there are people who desperately want their services, but for some reason can’t get a-hold of them? As if someone is sitting at home and gets their call and exclaims, “Oh thank goodness you called!!! I have been trying to reach you for days now, but could not get through!” (Probably because the phone line was busy due to the fact that they were calling everyone in the city just to make sure nobody wanted to talk to them.) Other businesses do not do this…I never get a call from McDonald’s asking if I am hungry and wanted to buy a hamburger from them.  *Maxi pads designed for thong underwear…no explanation required…  *People who say “no offense” right before blurting something completely rude, as though “no offense” is a qualifier that prohibits you from becoming upset at their comment…i.e. “No offense, but you look like you have gained a lot of weight…”  *7 day return policies…Are these establishments worried that their products will not hold up past 7 days?  *How doctor’s offices will refuse to see you and often charge you a fee if you are more than 15 minutes late for an appointment or do not show up or cancel without giving 24 hours notice, but will leave you sitting in the waiting room for 3 hours when you arrived early, and not offer you any discount on your bill for the inconvenience of the wait!
