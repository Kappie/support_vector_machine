Well no one's talking on msn cause they all like to eat giraffes instead and no I have no been eating monkeys. Sorry, need to get all the weirdness out of my system! Ahh... moral dilema day today but oh well it'll pass and it's not our problem alright guys! It's to do with Emily's birthday party. *sigh* Why does every one have to complicate things? Hmm... guess that'll go unanswered since we all do it! Ok here comes Lynne! Aaargh! I better go talk to her, wow pointless blog of the year!
