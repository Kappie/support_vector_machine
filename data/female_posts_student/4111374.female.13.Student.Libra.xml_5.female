That doesnt matter because my legs hurt so much because this morning my bus didnt stop for me so i had to walk 3km to get to the train station and then this afternoon i was waiting for my mummy to pik me up and she NEVER CAME so i called her and she said she had to take Cathe to the doctor and so I HAD TO WALK ALL THE WAY HOME, YES, YES THAT IS RIGHT I HAD TO WALK LIKE 6KM IN ONE DAY (MAYBE MORE IF YOU COUNT WALKING DOWN TO SCHOOL AND ALL THE WALKING I DO IN BETWEEN CLASSES I AM SO ENRAGED RIGHT NOW.            actually no, I so cant be bothered to be enraged right now, so I'll just be quietly fuming in the corner.               on second thoughts, I cant even be bothered to do that.   Screw this being angry thing, Im going to get some ice-cream.
