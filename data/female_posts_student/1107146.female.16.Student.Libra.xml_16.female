Rosie  Z, I don't fit the mold- I'm in all those "classes" that Rosie hates, even the prep  popular ones to an extent because they're all my middle school friends.  Not that I'm perceived to be in these groups by onlookers, but I'm there, just the same, whether I want to be or not.  Yall are my real group though.  Anyway, I MISS YALL!!!  And where's Lily lately?  I haven't gotten in my weekly bitch moment this week, and Lord only knows I need one (I'm just kidding.  I'm not really a mean person  Josh will even back me up on that one.)  I'll see you guys later.  Apparently I'll end up in the hospital if I don't go to bed RIGHT NOW.  God, mono sucks.
