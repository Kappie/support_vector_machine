I hate Hartley. *sigh* I actually like YC just because they dont judge you for wrong reasons. Theres no popularity contest there. *sigh* I wish I could just blow everything off my mind but I can't. Well for one thing theres like nobody to talk to about it. Hmmm..theres another problem. *sigh* so many people are getting on my nerves. Everyone is all cranky cuz they want school to yet out...dont blame ya I wanna get out too but you don't have to bitch at everyone..gosh I was just asking for a freakin piece of paper today and someone like fliped out. Have a Goddamned Cow! *sigh* Another thing I realized...I don't have any friends or like anything anymore. Theres a whole 2 people here I can talk to...Tracy and Ashley. Im like not close with anyone else and/or everyone else hates me. W/E. Im just so sick n tired of it. I really don't care anymore. If only I could move away. Hartley has had enough of me. To much maybe. But since theres no chance of me moving..I guess I'll I have to live thru the next 3 years. *sigh* I dunno if I can make it. I dont even have a social life anymore...I don't get invited to anything...Well I guess thats cuz I don't have any friends. *sigh* I can't even find a frickin locker partner for next year. *sigh* Im just a horrible person. I wish I was better....in many ways...I just need a life. or a best friend...Kait always tells me we're best friends and I know we are but still...not having one in your town...your school...its different. I guess I've just never been the same since Tori left. She was the greatest friend. She moved on..she found another best friend...but me...no. *sigh* Feels like nobody in the world cares. Dont you ever feel that way? Right now Im in just a low that it feels like not one person gives a damn. I know its not true...I know theres a few people that do...but not all...thats for sure. *sigh* I don't even know why I feel this way...Im like in tears for no reason. I just wish people at school would leave me alone...maybe I can just go through my day at school being a loner...wait I already do...Well if not...it sure feels that way. *sigh* I dunno. Everything would be all better if I moved...not far...just somewhere that I wouldnt have these gay problems...people that didn't know my past...a fresh start...thats what I need...but not on all...theres only one good decsion I've made in my life...only one. And I thank God for it everyday. Im glad I was smart last summer...I just dont't know what to do with my life now....  -Tara
