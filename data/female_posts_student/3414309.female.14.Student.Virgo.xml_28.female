Sunday: we all gathered at the church and got in our lil vans w / our groups and drove and drove and drove to the church (new hope) in humboldt park. i have NO IDEA wut time we got there ... but all we did was worshipped and like bed-stuff. fun fun  Monday: On Monday my group (Beijing) went to Cabriny Green. We just like cleaned some major nasty bathrooms (we're talkin like poo water up the wazoo here ppl)and then we used these big scrapers to scrape all the tile off of the floor and this girl in my group named jessica like totally got her finger all cut up and had to get 6 stitches. muah haha. then frida gave us this tour of like the projects where they live and man ... wow ppl ... just wow!!   Tuesday: Okay well  on tuesday we went to HOME which was like this old folks home for old people who like can't afford homes. ya know? but ugh we washed ALL the floorboards and walls, baseboards, doors, doorframes, etc etc etc. i mean common who really cares if their DOOR is dusty. but hey working for the Lord here ppl! hehe but neways me and michelle had to wash the deck and we kinda got in trouble for sprayin dan and juice w / the hose ... shh!! We got done early so we all went to the zoo and then to Ben and Jerry's for icecream (chubby hubby all the way baby)  Wednesday: YAY! today we actually got to be with kids!! whooo hoo! we went to Leif Ericson elementary school and got to be w / the kids there! omg cayon my lil boyfriend was so cute and i was totally in love w / him!! aww and they all thought (cuz we told them) that me and dan were gettin married and dan was 20 and i was 15 and they were all like "omg ur way to young" and it was so cute! one lil girl gave me her address so i could mail her an invitation! so yeah wednesday was def the funnest but it was really sad too. cuz like we were working w / like 3rd graders and they're teacher was like yelling and screaming at them and totally cutting them down ... 3rd graders fail 3rd grade at this school. how sad is that?
