Arrrrg, that be right: lest ye forget today is  urlLink National Talk Like a Pirate Day  (its also Friday, Payday and rock out with your boyfriend day for me so I'm REALLY stoked).  In honor of this great day I bring you a great pirate joke:  A pirate walks into a bar with a ships wheel coming out of his pants.  The bartender, scurvy bildrat that he is says "Uh, Sir, you know you have a wheel coming out of your pants?"  The pirate simply replies "Argh yes, its driving me nuts"  Now laugh or walk the fuckin' plank.
