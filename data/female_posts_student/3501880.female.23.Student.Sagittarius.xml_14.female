Oh fuck! Oh fuck! I have an interview today, and an interview tomorrow (which I am hoping I get the job today, so I don't have to dodge bullets driving to Gary, IN for tomorrow's interview, but knowing my luck...   I am really excited at the possibility that I might get a job that 1) will give me some legal experience 2) give me a paycheck 3) won't require me to say, "Would you like skim or whole milk in your venti, double-shot latte?"  Bad News: I just tried on my only suit, and realized how fat I have gotten...I knew the suit had been a bit snug before, but I merely had to suck in the gut ever so slightly to zip up the pants. This time, I really could have used an extra pair of hands to get the zipper up. Let's just say that I am really glad that I don't have a cock, cause I even caught a little skin while trying to zip up the pants.   What does this mean? Diet time! I am officially cutting out McDonald's, ice cream, and other deliciously evil things out of my daily food intake. I will run consistently again. In fact, I have been running a lot more lately, but I think I pulled a muscle in my leg last week.   Since I am now Quaker (I promised that I would become Quaker if my financial aid check was ready today, and it was...so there you go, I'm a Quaker!), I promise to God to lose 20lbs if I get this job I'm interviewing today...And that the attorney has a fetish for chubby girls who have to squeeze to fit into their only interview suit.
