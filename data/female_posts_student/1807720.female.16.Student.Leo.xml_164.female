We went from 4:00 - 6:30 today and on Wednesday we start the 4:00 - 7:00 rehearsals and other days we have some late night rehearsals from 7:00 - 900.  Not to mention that I have to miss three days next week to attend the High School Drama Festival at the U of C.  I am never sick and like I don't know how to catch up on missed work because I never really miss school.  I am going to have to find out the Bio work we have to do.  I don't want to miss Bio and at this point and I can't afford to.  I did bad on the last test - which yes I am still like killing myself over cause I didn't want to do that bad.  I can't even review the damn thing cause not everyone has written it and our Bio teacher is organizing the grad stuff or whatever it is.  Grrrrrrrrrr.  So frustrating.  Just goes back to my statement that no one ever has any time for anything.  I am still very sick of everyone condemning me for not understanding something or just plainly not knowing the answer.  Like leonard today I was like "yeah we have a lab in Bio today" and like that is ALL I said, nothing more and you know what he says to me.  He says "omg this is the easiest shit ever, that isn't anything freakin' hard Vanessa."  Like there we go again, I didn't even say it was hard, but then again making me feel stupid seems like the most popular game to play.  Even Brent asked me a question in Bio and I don't know what everyone seems to expect me to have ever damn answer.  When I told him "I don't know" all he says is "I thought you were suppose to be smart."   Hmmm so here is the message I seem to be getting: No one ever has anytime, people feel good about themselves when I do bad on things, and I happen to be dumb.  Ok so we both know that isn't true but sometimes after hearing the repeptitive negativity towards me I begin to think it is.  But it is not.  I can't let that get to my head.  I need positive self-talk.  If I learned any lesson from Chem last term it's to believe in yourself.  To think: VANESSA YOU CAN DO IT.  And yes I can do it, I can do anything, I am capable of anything.  That is what I must say to myself.  Deep down I know it to be true.  I am the girl with so many dreams.  Dreams of going to University and majoring in a science like Bio and becoming the most inspiring wonderful teacher.  I have the ability to pass Bio and do good in Bio.  For some unexplainable reason like so many things seem so difficult that cry over all the time, but I have got to where I am right now somehow.  I am here right now, on Honors w. Distinction.  I must have done something right.  I suppose that something might be hard work, effort, work ethic, whatever you want to call it.  I shouldn't listen to what others say *unless it's positive, lol* because I am so much better than that.  I am better to call others dumb or stupid or tell them that everything should be easy for everyone.  If anyone knows how difficult things can get at times that would be me.
