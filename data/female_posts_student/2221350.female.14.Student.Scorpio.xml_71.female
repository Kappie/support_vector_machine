IS NOT EXACTLY A QUESTION.  it's more of a moot point. i knew i would blog sometime this week, i just haven't been able to find a nice quiet second or two. but luckily i have.   i've been extremely busy doing seemingly unimportant things. i've been mercilessly tioling away at making a scarf which i don't know what i will do with when i get finished but i know it will be something important like mailing it to some pop star under the pretense that i am a sick 8-year-old who can't do anything except crochet because of all the chemo. ((that was a little freaky))  i've been thinking a whole bunch lately also. i've thought about how maybe i'm a little too narcissistic. i've noticed that i spend a good bit of time looking at myself and thinking that i am the most beautiful creature ever and then thinking, "but according to today's standards, i'm NOT". so this is what i ponder. i do believe i am extremely beautiful, but i don't think abyone else does. seriously, though, it's turning into an issue for me. even while this page was loading((super slowly because i'm on a school computer)) i saw my reflection in the monitor and thought "i have such a nice shaped head, and my hair is sooo shiny and blonde and i'm like one of the lucky few in the population who have naturally blonde hair and it's soooo beautiful and i'm such a freak". but anyways, maybe that's just me. i suppose as long as i'm not admiring myself all day to the point where it's consuming my life AND i don't APPEAR to be self-absorbed and narcisisstic in front of others, i can continue believing all this crap.  mom left for Los Angeles on sunday. i got up at 3:30AM to help her put her crap in the car and tell her bye. she's having a fabulous time, she's visiting the set of angelina jolee's((sp?)) new movie AND going to meet her AND going to take a picture, she's been spa-crazy, eating amazing food, and soaking up the alive, wondeful, we-actually-enjoy-our-existence feelng of the place. i'm still insanely jealous, but i suppose there's nothing i can do about it. since she's not here, it's very quiet around the house. the only noise is mammaw and devon arguing, which they do constantly. as soon as devon leaves a room, mammaw starts mumbling, and as soon as mammaw leaves a room, devon starts explicitly conveying her opinions. it's really quite annoying.   speaking of such, mammaw is checking me out today and we're gonna go see the johnny depp movie FINALLY. i think i will be dissapointed, but you never know.   i have tons more to talk about, but the bell's gonna ring soon.  1. brussel sprouts make me puke((like, projectile, seriously)) 2. i've only had the flu once in my life.  3. my favorite guy is scott clifton. 4. i watch General Hospital EVERY DAY. 5. i love sushi and using chopsticks. ((w00t w00t tr0y)) 6. i think L33T is a crappy computer fad that will be over tomorow. 7. i love marshmellow peeps, a lot. a lot a lot. i like them microwaved.   hey nikki, did your CD ever come in the mail?
