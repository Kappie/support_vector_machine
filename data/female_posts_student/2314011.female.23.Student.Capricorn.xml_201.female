Feeling pretty good about this last exam; it's Torts, I like the subject, have a pretty good grip on the material and the exam is only two hours.  The longest question is only half an hour; the rest is a mix of 20 and 10 minute questions.  Yay.   The day after tomorrow at this time will find me on the road, headed to The Boy for a weekend of coffee, hugs, DVDs, and maybe some hard core partying.  Good times.  Finally feels like summer's here...REALLY here, and it feels great.  Need to do some standing poses tonight.  As well as tidy up the apartment.  Have shavings from my front door on the kitchen floor to attend to, but it's worth it because of the big shiny new deadbolt installed yesterday.  I feel so secure.    The new cut is growing on me (bad pun intended).  It looks a bit different every day, which is both a good thing and kinda disappointing when I can't get it back to how it looked that one day when it was almost hot.
