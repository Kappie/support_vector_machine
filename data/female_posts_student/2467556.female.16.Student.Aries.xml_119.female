My mom has been freaking out for the past couple days, saying that i'm blowing off stuff blah blah blah....even though i have ALL A'S!!!  jeez, she drives me up the frickin wall sometimes!  She's all like "OMG you have an 89 in BCIS!!!  *gasp!* you got an 81 on a grammar test and now you've gone from a middle A to a low A!!!!"  a) she knows i suck at grammar, she's always known that and for some reason she all of the sudden feels that i should be acing that test, b) BCIS is a blow off class and therefore, i should give no effort, c) i have all freaking A's and i think she needs to get off my case!!!  She's acting like i've got all B's or i'm failing or something!!!  Alright, yeah, i have been blowing off studying for tests and crap like that for several weeks now......but i'm still getting A's and making good grades, so i say screw it.  i mean, who honestly studies for BCIS!?!  She also wants me to announce when i have a stupid test.....hmmm....no.  seriously, i can't wait until this year is over.  She also wants me to take summer classes.....yeah how about not.  I want to relax this summer, apart from my super easy babysitting job.  and i can drive, so i can do whatever the hell i want.  anyways, in other news.....Nathan's birthday was yesterday....i think thats what he told me.....i dunno, my unconscious selective chronic amnesia has kicked in and i can't remember.  But his party is tomorrow and i'm going, yay.  Nathaniel said he's going to force me to get in a boat because he knows i'm scared of boats and paranoid of them sinking.  He also knows that i don't like lakes.  Yet he's pressuring me into it by calling me a pansy....which i hate.  I can bet $5 that he'll get every other guy at the party in on it too and they'll all be forcing me into boats.  oh joy.  it'll be fun though.  So Tampa Bay lost in freaking OT to Philly.  They were a minute 30 from literally taking it all home.....but noooooooo, they have to let a goal go in from Primeau!!  And then in the last MINUTE 30 of OT, philly scores another goal!!!!  grrr, tampa shoulda had it!!!  You let me down Vinny!!!!  lol, he still looked hott. Game 7 in Tampa Bay on Saturday.......please god let tampa win!! i don't want to see Vinny and Martin cry!!  alright...time to watch Degrassi and Radio Free Roscoe (my fave Canadian Soap Operas!!)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
