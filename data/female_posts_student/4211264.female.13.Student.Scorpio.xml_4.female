I should be getting school supplies today, or tomorrow, which isn't a good thing. Because that means school is coming soon, and what kind of freak wants that? OK, I must be a freak, because it isn't that bad, until they sign a "major" assignment. What happens if we don't do it? It's just middle school, do we  need  to get good grades, will it matter to our college people. I don't really think so, isn't it just high school that matters? I guess I'm pretty stupid if I got those wrong. Right now I'm eating lucky charms, a resonably good cereal. Oh yeah, Hannah is watching TV too! I knew she would be. I think Hannah could be named the first or second most annoying sister in the world, and no one would complain, but her. She is a complainer, zats for sure. I gotta go now, do some illagal things.  -Sierra
