There was one high point to my day at work... the guy that came in stoned and asked to trade a sub for either pot, cigarettes, or cash. We accepted both the cash and the cigarettes.  Tonight. Ah... tonight. I got home to shower off the Jimmy Johns smell. Maybe they should make their own line of perfume or something. Jimque, the new fragrance from Jimmy Johns. Dork.  Michelle and I hung out for a few. I took her out of her house, she was stressed out because her car got fucked up by a drunk driver last night, plus Nikki and her father were being complete assholes. We drove around then ended up at my place. We sat and talked for a few then I drove her back to her house to pick up her work attire, met her at William's. No one was there so she sort of, not really, forced me to call Ned, then she went to work.  I sat in my car staring at my phone for a few minutes. Contemplating. Weighing consequences. Deliberating. Then I pressed the send button. I went over to his house and chilled for a few. Could he tell that I was nervous? Could he be more courteous? Could I blush anymore? We watched Jackie Brown. And yes, I made out with him. Woo. That's for all those assholes out there that I know read this for "dirt" on me. Well, a kiss is as dirty as it's getting for tonight's entry. Congratulations to you. The contemplation of if I "was going to take advantage" of him sorta raced through my mind a little too much, but I'm alright. Self control is a good thing... yes it is. Anyway. We took a break from the movie, smoked a cigarette (we did this twice). Then I dropped him off and was very lady-like as I walked him to the door. Goodnight kiss. Then the realization that rain was completely drenching me. But I was alright. I was fine. We made plans for tomorrow night. I guess I'm hanging out at his place for a few after work tomorrow. We'll see how that goes. I am so completely tired. I'm falling asleep at my computer and that's sad.  Yawn. Speaking of sleep. I keep having this recurring dream where I'm on band tour and get really sick. Maybe it's all in my head.
