Well I've got one tip for you, Take the leap of faith!  Slight obsession with the leap of faith! All every one needs is some encouragment... and with me, a lot of fluke! I think I got a lot of fluke while I was doing the SATs! Oh noooo! I'm missing Neighbours! I'm gonna go watch it then I'll go play on Virtua Fighter 4. And you really care don't you! Uhuh!
