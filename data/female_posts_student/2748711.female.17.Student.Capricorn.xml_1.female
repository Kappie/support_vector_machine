So much has happened in the last week and it has al become a blur really, I can’t keep up with it all, and even more so in the last few days. My god, I don’t know anymore. I just wish. Well I don’t know what is wish, I should post my story on here… if I still have it on this comp. nope I don’t, it was not a very good one anyway, it was just about my past life of being a raging alcoholic. I handed it in for my English class and the teacher had to ask me if that is what it is really like. I was like; um… no. and I also wrote another story about my trip around the world.  I don’t do much writing really, can’t be bothered or else I am sleeping, like all the time. I can’t wait till June 10th! Harry Potter comes out!!!!! WOO HOO. And I think the week after that our movie is going to be shown! The one we made for the 15/15 film festival, that is going to be so funny.  I am making a website at the moment for our Volleyball association. It is going to be good, because not only are we going to have everything you need to know about the game but we are going to have lots of other inside jokes if you like. Like we are going to have a lonely hearts section where Bridget gets to be the president, seeing as she is the loneliest, and just that sort of thing.     This damn class is so BORING! God damn I hate it. It makes you want to go to sleep. And the teacher is a right bitch, she really is the child of the devil.  Home is behind.  The world ahead.  And there are many paths to tread.  Through shadow,  To the edge of night  Until the stars are all alight   Mist and shadow  Cloud and shade  All shall fade  All shall...fade.   i love that song as much as i love the guy who sang it. GO BILLY
