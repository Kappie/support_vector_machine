Then it started to rain. Hard. Oh well. Around 7:20 I decided to walk over to mark's since he said loreli and him were going to be hanging out and I should stop by if I could. So, taking my umbrella, I walked the five or six blocks it takes to get to his house. No one was home. Oh well. So I walked back, cleaned up, and went back to Kevin, where the boys were minus alex. We went and got some movies with Carmen and Doug, and went back to watch charlie's angels 2. (I still say we should have gotten hellsing, but oh well) Around the end alex came back and matthew and andrew had left. Then we watched sleepy hollow which was really good. Johnny Depp. Enough said. Then we just hung out with the strobe light on till 3, when I went home. Alex is very comfortable. Even if he is a dork. And Kevin has very good aim. Especially if he's trying to get you in the forehead with a hard candy. (teeheehee) And then there's johnny depp.   Enough said.
