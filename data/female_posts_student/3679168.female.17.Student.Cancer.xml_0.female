They all ways make me feel bad about my self. Not that I have that great of self esteem already but the remind me of all the bad things I do and it makes me feel bad. They always bring up the fact that i "get around" that I lie. do drugs, drink, and steal, and they always remind me im going to hell. So i'm like well geez. It really makes me think. I am really a whore? Yes and no then i just go with yes cause thats what they said. I just fool my self when i say no anyway. I only lie when it's neccasary, i only drink on average 1 or 2 times a week and i only do hard drugs 1 time every like 3 weeks and smoke weed liek amybe 1 time a week. and i only steal when i think its a rip off so am i really that bad. whatever though i guess thats just who i am and they are my friends and obviously they accept me actuall now that i think of it they are the damn bawstrad who make me do all the dirty work oh what the fuck i'll fucking admit it im a bitch!  i just realized i kinda just mumbled all that together problly doesnt make sense but i dont care i feel batter sorta
