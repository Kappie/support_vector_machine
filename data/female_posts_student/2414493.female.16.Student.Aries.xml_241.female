I just sat on the edge of my bed for a while last night thinking with the Postal Service stuck in my head. "You don't go play golf with your dad on Father's Day but you go out with friends!" I mildly feel like I've betrayed someone.  I need to shower. In less than three hours I'm going to Nigel's to go to Third Street. Grandma came into my room last night and chastised me for returning late with the worst sour face in the world, and I'm supposed to sweet talk her for the use of her car today, since Mom drove my car again. At least I have something to drive. I don't want lunch. I know she'll make noise over that. I think I'll just shower and read.  Still tired.
