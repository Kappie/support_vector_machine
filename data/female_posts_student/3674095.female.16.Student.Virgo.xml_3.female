YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT INTERESTED IN THIS ARTICLE SO, JUST DON'T MIND THIS.. my life..what about it? i dunno..i guess i just have to write something in here, something for mr. good bastard to read. -->what about my life? ive been living on this surface for 16 friggin' years. yey, soon to be 17.. i often hate my life 'cause it's such a bore..i know..opportunities..yeah right!opportunities don't always come the way i would want it, of course it wouldn't..duh?! -->now, i really dont know what to type next. --> --> --> --> -->okay, i'd be talking about my life, as in. from my parents to the people i despise. hmm..lets start with my family then.. -->okay, my dad. his dad is half chinese, hence, the family name 'uy'. my great grand dad is a chinese, i think, who married a filipina, who died because of opium, they say. though when i was just a kid, my dad would tell me that he was eaten by a shark.. ..my great grandma died because of loneliness daw. anyway, back to my dad. he's 40 years older than i am. he's nice but he's got a heart of stone wneh it comes to things like what we feel.;( he's a lawyer. but we're not rich, argh!'cause he's a government prosecutor..if you're with the government, you're not supposed to get rich.what else..he's been on his butt with the government for more or less..uhmm, since 1974..do the math.woah..thirty!yuck! now my mom. she's with the government as well. tourism thingy..employee of NAIA~ travel tax stuffs..not really close to her. we talk, but no heart~to~heart talks for us!no way..then my brothers.got three older brothers. the eldest's life is a mess. he's 33, ata. he took criminology in college.then, became a sheriff, the one who claims unpaid cars..hehe;) then, back to school and took law. but, stopped. he's currently working in the city hall of muntinlupa as a hell-do-i-know-?- officer, a job he got because my dad is friendly. he's got two ,or more kids, two from a lady(?) i despise. he's a horny bastard as well, like someone i know. though there's nothing wrong about being norny, what he, my bro, did when he was horny was not so good. it would depend on how u react with your being horny. but he's now married to a lawyer, whom i dearly love, she's a martyr to have lasted with my brother this long, 3 years ata..now my second brother.he's gettin' maried next week. the girl is from davao, an okay girl. they're gonna marry on a saturday. i don't know how to adjust with my sked though. i have classes on saturdays!i don't want to be absent. i might go to davao alone.creepy..he's a typical black sheep. they say, at this point, im showing signs of being a black sheep already, signs they got from him when he was 22, im 6 years younger, so? he wanted to be take up vet med in college. my dad refused. he took up p.t. and flunked the board. still got no license. so, he's working in the agriculture department, in mutinlupa as well where my dad is currently assigned. i told you!my dad is friendly. now, the third one. he's a certified bum at 25.still not done with college. worse than a black sheep i daresay. he's terrible actually.but he's my best brother i guess, 'cause he listens to me. not that the other two won't, its just that..he's all i had/have in our home when i started getting mature enough to talk about things, SOME things.. now. me. -->me. im a self confessed bitch. though i dont like to be called a bitch, there's someone who insists on calling me a bitch.so, whatev. i'm an animal lover.that's why i take care of KiaKaha.;) i love my dogs.so much. i initially planned on taking up vet med. but instead, im a commerce student in ust for some reason i can't tell. ako'y isang tomasino..go~uste!i used to be a brat and i miss being one, but im proud that im no longer a brat. thanks to my oldest brother for dumping 2 kids in our home~ the new found brats.. im lazy. i'm okay with being idle. i'm tough at times. must be a trait from my dad. don't expose to people how i feel. but i talk a lot. senseless at times. i cry a lot. i'm such a cry baby.it is my defense mechanism against myself. you get me? if i don't want to think about it anymore, i'd just cry, pretend things are not the way they are. reality sucks. but if you'd see me, you'd probably think im trouble-free. 'cause as much as possible, i dont want to talk about it. the tendency is that i try to contain myself and solve it on my own, try not to bother anyone..im often predictable, doing a routine called di's life. but there are times that i'm confused with myself.i surprise myself with things..but these things are stupid.really stupid. things even my friends don't know about. im also selfish. im some sort of person you'd rather not mess up with 'cause, although i may appear nice, you know what they say about seemingly being nice..â–“
