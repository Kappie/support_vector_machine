And we went to the saturday market..which was kinda gross. then we went to pioneer place. I got a belt for my sister. But nothing for me...   Then I had my LAST GUITAR LESSON! How exciting! Now i officaly have NO LIFE! I am so excited this is the first time EVER that I don't do anything except for school. As weird as it  may sound its TRUE! All my life I have ALWAYS been busy..but now I AM NOT!   Now for a story.  So at Hello Dolly there was this guy who was sitting in front of me and he kept looking at me..so I was like "He is coool.." because he was. He had a kinda blonde-ish hair and he was wearing a teenage mutant ninga turtle sweatshirt. Haha.  After the show I just kinda forgot about him but then on the way to target on friday I was him..driving a car...in his teenage mutant ninja turlte jacket. Hahaha. He had a ton of bumper stickers. One said "We Love Jesus" and the other one said "Air1" then he had a sticker for my brothers karate place. Hahha. My brother knows him and everything. And my mom was like isn't that the picks friend? so she knows him tooo! It was soo weird....
