And she got me this awesome cake. She also let me higlight my hair yesterday! Woo-hoo! I got golden blonde highlights and they look awesome... Although- she did kinda get em lumped all together on the left side. It's ok, it still looks awesome!    The perks of being 16  My parents are pretty strict, so for me 16 means alot of stuff. Like, I'm allowed to "officially" date, I am allowed to highlight my hair (as long as it isn't pink or blue or green or purple...) I am allowed to wear makeup (I actually snuck that in around 15..) amoung some other things.  Plus- I can drive. Well, when I get my license I can drive.    I wonder what else my mom has planned  I know she just barely scratched the surface today. She said that she didn't want me to feel like Molly Ringwald in  Sixteen Candles . I guess that's a good reason to make my birthday awesome...    As for my friends..  I have no idea who is doing what. So far I haven't gotten any cards or gifts :-(. It's most likely that I won't. People other than my family tend to forget my birthday pretty easily. My grandparents sent a card... it was very nice. I wonder how old they think I am this year. (Last year I was still 13...)   Well...  I gotta go get ready to see  Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights ! I have been wanting to see it ever since I saw the teaser trailer. I can't wait!!! Hopefully it will be as good as the first one. But then again, sequels and prequels have the tendancy to suck. O well! Still can't wait!    I leave you with this important announcement: I'm still single....(lol)
