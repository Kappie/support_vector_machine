I found a really deep puddle, and I jumped in it for a few minutes, and Wonder Woman even came out to join me.  It was so much fun.  I'm definitly going to have to do it more often.  I'm pretty sure tha last time I played in the rain I had a little pink polka dotted umbrella.  I miss those days.  I think I need a new umbrella.  I'm going to have to buy one some day.  I don't think I have one.   A while ago, I was in Marshall Fields with Wonder Woman, and we were looking at rain boots.  I kinda wish I would ahve gotten a pair, but I wish more that I had gotten on of the cool umbrellas with a frog or a duck on it.  Fun rain gear is esential for sanity. But enough about that.  I just looked at our calendar, and apparently, we're supposed to go to my grandma's lake cabin tomorrow.  I think it would have been nice to be informed of that.  But whatever.  I'll have to pack a bad.   I can't think of anything else worthy of blogging, so I'll blog later.  Oh and Abner, I showed my cousins your LotR spoof tonight, and they loved it.  I'll see you/type to/talk to you all later.
