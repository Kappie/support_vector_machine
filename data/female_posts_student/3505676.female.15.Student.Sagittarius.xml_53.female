It wasnt exactly sunny, but i still had a REALLY good time!  Haha esp showering in the rain with the guy trying to cut off our water supply.  Plus we know how Laney likes it...HUGE [[waves]] Went to the planet smoothie/laundromat and got our pretty t shirts! VEGGIE HOT DOGS! The sunny car ride home..sheesh!  Back to raleigh/back to reality *lol*.  Home for dinner and then out to nice price books to look around and see if there was nething i wanted with my low cash flow *kinda*  Got an old-ish liz phair cd that i really like.  Also had a really good talk w/ jana tonight.  Won't go into the deets but im gonna miss her like crazy!   TODAY WAS DEF. AN ADVENTURE!
