I have the window open right now so I can smell the fresh air and warm breeze... plus the house is beginning to smell weird--not bad but not entirely pleasant either--after being shut up all winter...   I love spring...  ...I feel so happy today...  And I think it is completely because of the weather because today's events seemed like they'd be enough to put me in a less than terrific mood on any other day.  ..Oh, and I also must declare my affection for boys. (Except Corbin; I really wish that he would just give up...) Really, the simple, goofy things that they do by nature are so great... But maybe that's because I'm already in a semi-euphoric mood...   I'm reading  Lirael , sequel to  Sabriel , and, oh!, it is sooo gooooood! :) I love books...  (Alright, now I'm kinda mad. When I was getting the link for Lirael, I was glancing over the comments, and some ass gave away the story...Bah...)  I'm also totally loving this mood I'm in. Not only am I so amazing happy, I'm also in a lovely mood that makes me want to take me camera, pack a simple dinner, and go hiking in the woods--either on the Appalachian Trail or the C Canal...  I need to go take some pictures.. I still haven't had a chance to get some good use out of my camera since I got it on Christmas... :\ It's sitting right here beside the computer begging for me to take it somewhere... Poor thing..   Oh, and I kind of dressed up today. Today was the first day that I didn't wear a t-shirt to school in, I think, several years. I wore a simple white shirt with spaghetti straps with a button-up shirt that was white with thin, light pink stripes and left it unbuttoned. And I wore some brand new jeans..the kind that look really faded. ...Oh god! I loved it. ..And I had my hair up and was wearing my glasses... hehe, Not to be conceited, but I looked damn good! :D  ...And I guess I still do since the only difference now is that I am wearing pajama pants with adorable black kitties on them... :)  Yay!  ...There's some bad news, but I'll post that later as not to spoil the joy of this post...
