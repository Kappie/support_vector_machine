Recently I was bombared by e-mails sent from the crazy ex-girlfriend of the guy I am currently dating. I really wanted to retalliate, but I knew that would only esclatate the matter and make me look bad. Still, I have all these mock responses and no place to send them. Seems like a waste of good sarcasm, no?  Then my friend recieved an e-mail from a former professor (with whom she was having an affair) asking her to write a "letter of recommendation" for a new job he was applying for. This asshole, lied to her, broke her heart, dumped and then acted as nothing happened and now he's asking for a letter of recommendation? She's too nice to write the kind of letter she wants to. But wouldn't it be great if she could post it some where?  And there are other scenarios as well. Has a boss written you up for something at work and you are dying to respond? Has an ex-boyfriend sent you a really ridiculous e-mail and you need to vent? Well, this is the forum for you. Please send both the original e-mail and your ficitious response to  urlLink openresponses@hotmail.com   All real names will be changed to protect the innocent and the guilty. If there are is a particular psuedo name you want to use for any of the persons please indicate that.  Yours Truly,  The Responder
