To care and cherish And get coldness To give smiles And get tears To cry alone And get loneliness To offer your words And get silence To give it all, and get nothing? You give yourself And get an empty life You give your heart And get a stab  I’ll tell you…  It’s a painful way of living With no sense It’s the wrong way to be happy It’s the right way to reach the end  And the end is near Sooner then you imagine There will be no time to say - Goodbye.  ]-[ellMistress * Strait From Hell 4U
