I feel that my blogs reveals me as to be someone who is a meek, love sick person who is always depressed and that is not true at all. When I wrote those, I just wrote what I thought were my feelings. I really think that those wern't my feelings at all. I think I was masking my true feelings and yes I still am. But the thing is, I can't talk to other people about my true feelings, because they are down so deep, so numb that I myself isn't sure what to think anymore. I made them numb for a reason, because I dont want to be that person I said earlier. I know that I can be a strong person, as long as certain things are numb. I am believe that I am. I dont know how I truely feel, and I am glad I don't. I have chose not to be a stereotypical girl teen. I don't want to think about boys all the time, I don't to be self centered. I dont want to sweat the small stuff. I just want to be me. I think that is the most important thing. I refuse to become someone else to please others. I am my own person and that is starting to show more and more each day. So really for those of you who think I need to talk all the time, thank you for listening, but I don't think I need to and I also think I have given you the wrong impression. For some of the feelings I have told you about were, well false. I know that now. But I am not sure what the true ones are yet and don't want to know. And by the way, the last post was one of them. One of those posts that I didn't know my ture feelings and said them in the wrong way. Gee I hate hormones. They are so stupid. So I am here to tell you that I am a strong person and I will always try to be. So good bye for now, who ever reads this. I know it doesn't make much sense, but nothing of me does anymore.
