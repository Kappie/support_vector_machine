She sighed and dropped down onto the floor with her back against the wall.  The dungeon wasn't the worst part of her capture; it was the fact that she had been caught by the invariably stupidest law enforcer in the land, it was an awful scar on her pride.  She gave another sigh, drew her knees up to her chest, wrapped her arms around them, and stared blankly across the room.  ***  Sheriff Thomas Hood sat straining over arrest papers.  He muttered about the difficult words and how he should be wandering about the village catching other pieces of  filth.  Old Tom, as the village called him, had had his moment of grandeur and boasting when he had caught the blasted elf, but it was soon to wear off with the hard leaf that lie before him.  He scratched at his balding scalp and rapped on the wooden table with an old featherless quill.  He scratched his head again twice before he placed his quill into the ink well and began to sloppily draw out the arrest record.  ***  Andolin had moved from her drawn up position and was throwing loose stones at the ugly, cracked masonary wall.  If only she had a quill and paper, her bored mind would have something to do.  What was worse, claustrophobia was beginning to settle in, and the shadows seemed to be crawling closer and closer to the young elf.  *Letalas, you'd better get her soon.*  She stood and walked to the small, barred window that didn't give much light into the dungeon.  She stood just outside the dim square on the floor.  This offered her the best view without temporarily blinding her.  ***
