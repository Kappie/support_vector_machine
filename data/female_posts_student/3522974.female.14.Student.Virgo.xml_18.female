I prayed for a girl at school who's mum died last night. So many people were crying, i don't even know the girl but it was all so emotional. She was apparently diagnosed with it 2 weeks ago and died yesterday. She has two daughters at roseville and so everyone in their years had tears in there eyes. (*sniff*sniff*) What's even worse is that their father wants nothing to do with them. So many people are dying from cancer lately it is soo sad. Pip's grandpa has bowel cancer, my mum's good friend has just died of cancer, my dad's mum died of cancer and her sister two weeks ago. Also my dad's friend and now this poor girl at school. So everyone who is reading this right now, this is a reminder to  live life to the max . Luv Casey-mai Ps.  urlLink Beth  i am trying to do this link thing....it is not working!
