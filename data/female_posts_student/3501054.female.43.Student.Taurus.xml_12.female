True that air conditioning is hard on me now. the Lettuce at lunch made me sick at my tummy not used to a meal that does not include heavy meat proteins and frijoles negros (refried black beans) Other things memorable from the trip.... The guys at the center took to telling me that I was stronger than good whiskey.... I take that as a compliment.... I had a beautiful little male admirer of about 25 yrs of age.... CUTIE!!! I fell in love with the Honduran people. They are warm, loving and friendly.  I loved what I saw of Guatemala, as well... There is definitely a for-fun trip in my future....Love that part of the world. Met some of the most interesting European and American back-pack vacationers. The ones that came in on tour busses are annoying....VERY Annoying  I want to explore my options as a geologist. Geology is my minor...I was never able to say which one I preferred.... Geology or Archaeology. Love them both.  I took 9 and a half rolls of film, but most of you will not care for all the pictures of bones and teeth that I took... So I will spare you and just pick out the Temple and town shots  Good to be home.  Every woman should travel to a foreign country alone at least once. There is nothing more empowering than landing on foreign soil, navagating to a different state....finding a specific town...finding your lost companions without an address.....and all with very little linguistic experience or aptitude.  I will bathe in hot water every chance I get. I will hold my grandkids close I will kiss my children, no matter how old or how much they protest. It will take a long time to quit testing the lights and water to make sure they are still on each day. Goodnight. Evie
