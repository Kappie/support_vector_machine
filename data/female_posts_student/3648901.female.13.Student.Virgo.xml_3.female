Ashley touched the bottom of the deep end(girl I swear to god thats like 10 feet) and we had an overall good ass time :P At school Ms Miller made us play Scatergories and dont get me wrong I love the game but it sux when you play it as a class so yes.....boring... My cat Zooti tends to chew my hair because he loves water and/or chlorine so aha I had a fucking fun after school. I also got my Social Security Number so in 3 weeks I will be able to legally get a job! So yes there is not much else, oh and I have the song Truly Madly Deeply by Savage garden stuck in my head so ya...life sux lol.  This is just out to all mah girls at Sherbrooke and Heath! I LOVE YOU GUYS DONT EVER CHANGE! KEEP THE FLAWS TOO!:P
