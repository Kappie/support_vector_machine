She then asked him if she were to leave would he   cry, and once again he replied with a no...   She had heard enough.   As she walked away, tears streaming down her   face the boy grabbed her arm, and said....  You're not pretty...you're beautiful...  I don't want to be with you forever...i need to   be with you forever...
