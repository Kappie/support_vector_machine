Ah well, what can ya do. Things have been going pretty good lately, and I'm glad. Has anyone else noticed that the directors r really moving fast this year? I mean, for one, none of the freshmen were ready for their tryout when they did it, and we're learning the show alot faster than last year. The poor freshmen...they're so confused. And then that STUPID guy that is helping out was like "ok, your line looks absolutely horrible.." And he kept distracting us and confusing the hell out of us all, and he only made things worse! And it's the freshmen that are screwing it up, not anyone else. And so he tells us that we're all wrong, and he's looking at the wrong set, and yet doesn't even realize it after I try explaining it to him...whatever. Isn't he like supposed to be older and wiser? Cuz the guy seems like a freaking dumbass to me. Ah well, that's all my pointless ranting for the day.  Haha...don't you like how my ranting is about stupid stuff involving marching band? My...it's so consuming of my time...I spend like my entire autumn without a life. Meh, what can ya do.
