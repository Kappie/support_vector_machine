I am getting annoyed but I think it will get better once everyone is not working at the same time.   My best friend leaves for the Coast Guard in less than two weeks.  I am pretty jealous and wish I were joining something.  I miss the military.  Not all the bullshit I put up with but the camaraderie and stuff like that.  I really don't have that many friends now.  I mean I do...but they are all married and boring.  Okay not boring but would rather spend their time with their husbands than go hiking or taking a road trip.  Oh well, I will get over it soon.  I have 3 weeks left of school for this mini-summer session.  I don't know if I mentioned it.  I really am going to like Eastern.
