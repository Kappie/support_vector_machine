"Todo" sounds too much like "Toto," and "Burrows" sounds like--well, burrows. A digging dog? Start over: Use his nickname or middle name. I don't like my name--it sounds too vain: "Belladonna Proudfoot."    Ching, do you have a wedding date set?    Being a lapsed Catholic, I can appreciate the aforementioned joke. :)
