Everybody is fussing around him, up to the extent that my mother went to my godmother's house to get the digital thermometer and she even went out early in the morning to buy the strip thermomter (a stip of colours which would turn green if  you press it against your forehead). Naturally, it is the least accurate thrmometer AND the cheapest too ($3). Anyway, now my godmothers are sending fruits for my brother, what to do? He is a boy afterall, the one who can carry the surname and the one who can escape from anything and everything with his SWEET mouth! -__- *bleah* Oh, and just now I had my tution and my teacher was late for 15 minutes and my father (sick with cough) was so angry, he shouted at me to call her. In the end she came in a hurry and she forgot to wear her contact lenses. I thing she is having an exam, she was reading her notes and I predict again that she is in the engineering course or something like that. ^_^ Ta da for now ! ! !
