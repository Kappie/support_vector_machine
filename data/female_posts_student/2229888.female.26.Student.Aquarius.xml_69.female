Besides, she was a southern girl, made to be golden and smelling of sun-baked grass. Everybody knows a true southerner has two names with three syllables! Billy Bob... Linda Sue... Toni Lynn... In the south, it's a given. ___________________________________ Toni Lynn moved a lot as a kid. She never attended the same school for an entire year. As a matter of fact, she never attended school much at all. Her parents were intelligent but lazy. Why make a kid do her homework when she could clean the house, make dinner, or rake the yard? That was a waste of good labor. Why enroll a child in school when they could pretend to home school her? No one would know. They never lived anywhere long enough for anyone to figure it out. ___________________________________ Toni Lynn did finish high school, somehow. She read a lot and books aided her in passing any test the community college threw at her. She got her high school diploma at nineteen, hoping against hope there would be a college exam somewhere in her future. ___________________________________ Toni Lynn's dad was a computer analyst. He made a lot of money, and he spent a lot of money on high-priced hookers and God knows what else. There was no money for college, and Toni Lynn couldn't apply for aide because Dad made too much money. ___________________________________ However, for one nice summer, Toni Lynn and her oldest little brother convinced Dad to invest in a community college. "We'll work and pay for the next semester, if you can just get us started!" ___________________________________ It was a great time that couldn't last forever, through a million circumstances that would make this BIO too damn long, Toni Lynn obtained custody of her baby brother and sister. She quit school then got a couple of jobs and an apartment. She had to fight to enroll her baby brother in high school, and fight to keep her parents from taking her brother and sister away, but it was definitely worth the fight. Those were happy days. Just she and her three siblings, living off of instant mashed potatoes, mac N cheese, and new-found sanity. ___________________________________ Flash forward a couple of years and Toni Lynn's brothers are in the military, her parents are separated and paired with un likable characters, and Toni Lynn is married and well on her way to being pregnant. ___________________________________ Toni Lynn's baby is born in October. He lives a few precious hours before giving his final breath and his goodbye heartbeat. ___________________________________ Flash forward a few years later to a 26 year old single mom trying to carve a path out of a life as hard as stone... boy do her knuckles hurt! Hmmm... To coin a phrase, "That's all I've got to say about that."
