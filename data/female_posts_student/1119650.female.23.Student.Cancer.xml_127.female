Judge Sweet is the magistrate presiding over the  urlLink "McDonalds made my kid fat"  lawsuit.  Earlier today Judge Sweet dismissed this lawsuit commenting "Where should the line be drawn between an individual's own responsibility to take care of herself and society's responsibility to ensure others shield her? The complaint fails to allege the McDonald's products consumed by the plaintiffs were dangerous in any way other than that which was open and obvious to a reasonable consumer."  I have been saying this for quite some time now.  When are people going to stop blaming all their problems, ignorance and otherwise boneheaded behavior on others?  Why hasn't  urlLink natural selection  selected against people who're lacking common sense?  How are juries full of people awarding millions of dollars to these bumpkin retards?  I'll be the first one to say that I don't think its fair for these global corporations to be rolling in money without giving something back, but really is allowing every idiot from a trailer to sue because they're too stupid to be responsible for themselves setting a good example?  I think not.    I'm just glad that someone else out there how saw utterly ridiculous this lawsuit was.  No healthy girl can eat a McMuffin for breakfast and a Big Mac for dinner everyday and maintain her figure unless she has some serious issues with bulemia or a wicked affinity for the "horse".  Argh, I hate people like this.  Blech.  Die!
