We got to my house, he couldnt stay for long so we walked him half way back and that was possibly the end. emmm as soon as we got back, we ate, and richard, one of my ma's friends was all spilling, and saying everyoen had a bet the me and my pal were gonna get wasted, so we drank a shot and that was the end for me and her drinking up,  i drank mines for nick, cause i missed him so much, i still do.  So that was for nick,    emm after that we watched a movie and watched as richard threw up outside my house because he was more drunk then he expected everyone else to. lol it was funny, then we fell asleep.        That was the end of that.   overall i had a great 4th of july.                  laterz
