An excerpt from that link, italics mine:  'Although takins have no skin glands, their entire body secretes an oily, strong smelling substance  that is said to have a burning taste.  It is believed that this smelly, thick substance serves as a moisture barrier on the animal's coat, protecting it from moisture caused by fog and rain that frequents its grazing grounds.'  I am sure it can be boring out there in rural China, but QUIT LICKING THE TAKIN. Although I do like the idea of teenage farmhands hazing each other with takin skin-glop.   #1: Here, lick this oxen-like creature. All the cool peasants are doing it. #2: Ahhh! It burns!"   urlLink -mimi smartypants
