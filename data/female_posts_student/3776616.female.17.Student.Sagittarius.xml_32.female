I woke up at 10 this morning, did all the dishes (the huge pile in the sink and the stack on the counter), folded all the laundry, started a new load, put the newspapers in a bag and took them to the garage, and straightened up the living room.  It's past 12 and Kait isn't even up yet...  But of course, dad will come home and what I did won't be even close to enough for him, then he'll yell at me for something stupid, and I'll probably end up getting even more grounded than I am now, which is just fucking stupid as hell...  GRRRRRRRRRRRRR....  Idk...  Lainie still hasn't called me, even though she's been telling me that she will for a few days now.  And Idk when she works, so idk when I can call her...  Sam's pissed at me again b/c I told him all the stuff I wanted to tell him at the carnival, and he thinks we're all overreacting about the Hayley thing and it's not true at all, and...  wtf???  I'm glad I ended up doing it in IM instead of on the phone or in person, b/c I started sobbing when he replied to every thing I said.  He didn't really answer any of my questions, and the ones he did were the answers that I was expecting...  I just...  It's not fair, and I know that's a stupid line to say, b/c everyone knows that life isn't fair, but still...  I guess as long as I have something to keep myself occupied I'll be fine.  Play practice has been fun so far, although my parents haven't been all that supportive...  On the way home from play prac. last night my mom asked me what my lines were, and I showed her.  "Is that it?" then she laughed.  Then she asked me if I was on stage any other time, and I told her those were my only lines, and she just gave me this look... idk really, it just pissed me off so much.  Like, what does she expect?  I got a part in a play that I didn't even try out for, and all she can do is laugh b/c it's a small part instead of some fucking lead role.  She probably won't even fucking want to come to watch the play...  My dad already can't b/c he's out of town... I don't care really, I'd rather that they weren't there anyway.  I'd prefer that my friends come, and my aunt and stuff.  w/e...
