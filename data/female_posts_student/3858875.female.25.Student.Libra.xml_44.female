It all started when D and C were talking about who in Sault Ste Marie, their hometown, they'd like to laugh at now.   if you were wondering, 4 of 6 of us were in some form of high school musical ensemble.   so Hi Lewis was the star quarterback at e's high school (in denver) and was, as marcia brady would put it, 'the big man on campus.' he was also apparently in freshman french in his senior year. E was stoked when, one day, they served detention together.   Hi went on full football scholarship to Vanderbilt, and she had no idea what happened to him. minor league football anywhere? enter google.   Poor Hi got his first outing with Vanderbilt in his junior year, and that only lasted 6 passes. in fact, his coaching staff had had Hi as their first string quarterback, but were interested in also trying a few freshman. guess they got the good role.   We couldn't find any references to Hi on college football websites or on any crazed vanderbilt football unofficial fan page - the kind that tracks every player who's gone through the system.   i'm sure that, after a single click, this post will become on of the top hits. (and i better be careful i don't become one of his!)   i'm not convinced that E doesn't still hold a small flame for Hi, and so I welcome any updates (real or fictional) on his whereabouts and doings. And also those of any obscure but decent enough to be recruited for college athletes.   the next denverian to look up: Johnny Stang.
