Then when Mute sent me the copy of the conversation, I agreed with Abby. That made Mute even more angry. I think he is just acting like he doesn't want her, because, he is afraid if he asks that she will turn him down. That is just my opinion, I know Mute doesn't want to hear it either. I think he has asked four other people about it, and they all agree with Abby and I. I would like to ask Ian if we could post Abby's conversation on the website, just to see what everyone else thinks. Unfortunately I know the answer, he is going to say no. He isn't talking to either of use since the whole conversation has happen. But, I just think he is embarrassed.
