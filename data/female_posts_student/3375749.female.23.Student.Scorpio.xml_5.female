She's got the whole Macy Grey sound going on.... Anyways, I feel like poop. Like you really wanted to know that. Lol. I just feel drained of all energy. I need to start working out again. I think that's part of my problem. Plus since dance is done for the summer the only workout I ever get is prying poor turtles from Tanks mouth. He's like a turtle feind. Everytime I let him out to go to the bathroom he finds another turtle hole and has to harrass the darn thing. And these are the endangered ones!! Silly dog. Luckily he's never hurt one. Just scared the crap out of it. Well this post is dangerously boring so I'll say adios and post tomorrow. Adios.
