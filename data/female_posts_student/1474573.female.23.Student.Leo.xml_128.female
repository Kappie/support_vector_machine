I woke up this morning feeling like two midgets kicked me in my shins and now I just can't find the midgets.................fucking midgets.' My roomates are struggling to understand me. I seem normal most times except for the writing binges I go on where I come out of my room looking like a bear with a bad perm. So you see  i updated. I'm sure I'll get comments from the peanut gallery disappointed with my descriptions of them in my list of blogs so bring it on you ego maniacs!    Thinking about:  Graduation,Rikers Research, Teaching, How I'm gonna support myself after                graduating   Listening to: Jason Mraz and Norah Jones   Loving:  The view from my window   Guilty Pleasure:  Hanging out with m.c. siegel and listening to Tracy Ullman's greatest hits album   How to Charm me:  Be completely honest with me and then feed me and give me a hug    How to Annoy me:  Be  too ego-maniacal to see through your own bullshit, hang on the thread of others validating who you are and THEN post it on your blog and think it's the greatest fucking thing ever.  peace, poetry and progress
