Teachers are starting to get all up-tight.  "There's still two weeks left!  Don't start slacking off!!" blah blah blah...  I'm trying to see if I can get my hair done this weekend.  Mom still hasn't given me a straight answer though.  I have about $30 to do with what I want to.  I have to see if I can get somebody to take me to the mall.  Mom still hasn't gotten a hold of my orthodontist to bitch them out about my braces yet.  I hope she gets some answers cuz this is ridiculous.  hmm... what else...  Life I guess is just crap right now.  Summer is a huge welcome.  I'm getting used to the fact that I'm going to be a senior next year.  I'm not maturing my-self yet though because I'm not officially an adult yet.  I don't want to waste my childhood.  So, I'ma be crazy, random, immature me until the day I get out of this "hell hole".  People can say all they want about how they want to get out of high school, but in truth, no one really wants to leave.  Sure, no one likes the work and all that crap.  But after a while, you're gonna miss seeing all those familiar faces and saying hi to people twenty times between classes.  You'll miss laughing at the pranks.  And as much as you hate it, you'll miss the drama.  Gossip in the real world is just what you hear on the news.  Only if you're lucky will you get any at work, and it's just not the same.  I'll be the first of my group of friends to admit that yes, I am going to miss high school.  As much of a pain it has been, I'll never forget it (until I'm old and senile).  And I won't believe a damn person that says they'll never miss it.  because they will.  well, here I go to get ready for my last year.  I'ma make it a good one. later dayz
