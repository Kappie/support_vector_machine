Maybe it's psychological -- we know its Monday (or Tuesday--whatever the case may be), and we convince ourselves that that is bad.  I don't know. In all honesty, this week hasn't been nearly as bad as I had anticipated, and that's great. Kent is over with (and I don't feel incredibly guilty because I managed to pull of an award with Alex), my term paper is finished (turned in to the MLA satan, gratefully), I made NHS, and I'm good.   Okay, so today, Marie and John go into Dr. Pattersons room at the end of lunch (to do God knows what), and Heather and I are just sitting there--I'm thinking what it is that they actually do because they evidently feel as if the lunch room is not adequate for their endeavors. So I grab Heather and tell her we're going to find out. We sneak down there (I was wearing my bright red heeled hooker boots-- you hear them coming a mile away), and sneak into the office. Just as we think we did something successfully, Marie spots us. Oh my God, she was so mad. But it was so great. The whole situation is pretty disgusting actually, she's so infatuated and its amusing, but that's that. I don't care. It's her life, and as a good friend, I shouldn't denounce what she thinks is good for her, because I'm just wasting my time.
