Sunnyside Ave., if I recall, which would've made my pornstar name Ginger Sunnyside, if you've heard that one. Something about pets...   Anyway, we were hellish brats with bangs higher than we got on drugs later on. Which is pretty fucking high, believe you me. So we got sent to our bedrooms a lot. You know, to "think about what you've done." This was the least severe punishment of them all, not only because it involved no soap eating, but also because my sister's room and mine directly adjoined. It went like this: hallway, sister's room, my room. She had a Donald Duck sticker on her door that came with the house, but that's neither here nor there. Here's the glorious part: Outside of her bedroom window was a faucet that you hooked a hose into.* If you were kid sized, this was perfect for stepping onto and then jumping to the ground.   What I would have given for this window in my teenage years. But unfortunately, we'd moved by then. Maybe my parents suspected the inherent danger in having windows 5 feet from the ground. Maybe they were just rich at the time. Who knows. Anyway....   If you were kid sized and stupid, like my sister and I generally were, you'd climb out that motherfucking window and go play in the sandbox in our back yard. That sandbox kicked ass. I have no idea where it came from, but it even had a roof, so the sand wouldn't get wet in the rain. That's whywe always went to the sandbox and not, say, down the street to the neighbors' kids' place to poke dead things with sticks, where we would not have gotten caught. And we never wanted to get caught, but we almost always did. Almost always.   My sister and I got utterly sauced the other night. Thisis not uncommon, but she had this glorious drunkensimile, which conversely  is uncommon,that turned out to be totally insightful. I made a few life changes recently, to put it lightly,and am about to make aridiculously bold move that involves passports. Definitelty bolder than I've ever been before. My sister says, glass of white in hand: You're in the sandbox. I'm so proud of you.   Hell yeah, I am.Bring on the rain.      *Definitely a proper name for this that I don't know at all despite the landscaping job I had in college. Sorry. Asshole.
