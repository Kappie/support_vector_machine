Good job deb.so yeah... we got a little turned around when we got there but we found the fea estate alright. we ate a little lunch and then headed to the beach where things were just lovely. the water was b-e-a-u-tiful, and not freezing like in the hamptons. i lost my bathingsuit once or twice but hey, it was all for the cause. i also wipped out on the boogie board a few times but dave was there to save me so yay!... i also almost killed feas uncle with a kadima paddle, that was fun... around 5:00 we headed to the bay where we were gonna go on the jet skies. that was fun. i went on with eric which was cool cause we hit a boat wave and like went 4 feet in the air, and then i went on with fea which was cool, and then i drove w/ Rob which was an experiance. we tipped over and that was wet.... that night was funny... we got all ready to go and went to this place called "The Chicken or the Egg" where they have famous spicy chicken wings... we all tried the ones that the boys ordered and omg, the hottest one was Ludacris and you know the food is going to be spicy when they tell you when you order that you wont be getting your money back if you dont eat what you order, and melka that anmial wolfed down 2 of them... lets just say my mouth was burning for a good 20 minutes.. and not even dull burning, full out, ouch my mouth is on fire burning... later that night around 11:30, 12ish we went on the beach and hung out.. that was really realxing... just sitting on the beach at night, listening to the waves break... heaven... so then the next day it rained for most of it but breakfast was cool, we all sat around the table and talked for a long while till we decided to go look around the town and stuff... that was cool... its such a nice place, long beach island. it stopped raining eventually and we headed to the beach again where we went in the water, which was beautiful with awesome surf... then that night we went to a sort of italian place and then mini golfing. i won a free soda at the end but i wanted free ice cream so ugg to that. we went back to the house and watched Dirty Work and i feel asleep for the beginning of The Water Boy when deb, attempting to take a picture of me sleeping fell over and hit something that woke me up lol... that night i dreamed a pleasent dream and then when i woke up realized it was just that... a dream.... and today, we hit the beach for a while, rompped around, tanned, and then it was time to go.. we went and did some shopping, got chocolate and fudge and got our plams read by Sally the Physic... she said that i would live long, have three kids, get into a good school, that i had a past life, and that i'm going to have a lot of fun in about 2 weeks... yay!... and that was that... the car ride home was okay, read a little bit of the Hemmingway book we needed to read for school so go me being all studious... lata... florida very soon!
