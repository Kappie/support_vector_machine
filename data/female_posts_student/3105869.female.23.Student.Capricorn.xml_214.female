For example, when I am in the US I grocery shop waaaaay too much during finals or deadlines or other fun times.  Here the laundry room is suddenly overwrought with people using machines to wash a pair of socks.  Last night however was the worst, one of my friends got bad news about her friend having a heart attack, everyone was still engaged in heart to hearts with me and all I wanted was some red wine.  I was just following orders?!  The professors keep telling me to goof off and take it easy so....it all started by me just doing what they said.  Then we were watching CNN and all arguing about Darfor, however you spell it, and whose fault it was, blah blah blah and suddenly the new bottle of wine was finished.  Anyway, these things can unwittingly escalate from where you meant to have a glass and after hours of sitting on the penthouse hallway's floor with an ever changing group realize that its nice you were sitting just outside your room, you are not in any condition to walk.    So instead of walk I decided to IM half the world and probably sound really stupid and tell people about my blog address when that was the last thing I should have told esp 1 of them.  Genius.  Genius. Genius.
