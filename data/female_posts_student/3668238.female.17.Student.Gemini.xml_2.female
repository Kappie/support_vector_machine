'A few months later, on his next visit, he took Isabelle for a walk in the garden and told her that he was being posted abroad and that he was not in a position to continue their friendship. he skated round the question of marriage with pleas of poverty and unworthiness. isabelle didn't care whether he married her or not, but when he said he would not see her again she felt the simple agony of bereavement, like a child whose only source of love has gone. for three years her loss coloured every moment of her day. when at last it became bearable it was still like a wound on which the skin would not thicken, so the least thing could reopen it. the reckless innocence of her unguided childhood was finished, but eventually a sweetness and balance in her nature returned.' this section stands out to me. the book has yet to mention war actually lol but a very steamy (and by the woman's description - very satisfying) scene! 'she was choking with passion for him, but he frightened her. she wanted to comfort him but also to be taken by him, to be used by him.' hmm i like this book lol newas gota go watch the match! sarah xxx
