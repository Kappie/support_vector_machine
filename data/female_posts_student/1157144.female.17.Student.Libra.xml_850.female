I understand your point of view, but I think there are A LOT of misunderstandings between us.  The concert seat thing may have been what set you off, but after reading that, it is clear that there were issues prior. So about the seats.  I wasn't trying to be malicious, but yes, it pissed me off that you said we could have our seats back when they started playing. And they did, and you ignored us when we tapped you on the shoulder to ask you to move back.  Maggie and I are each about a foot shorter than you; we couldn't see from where we were standing, but you probably didn't know that. And, actually, I was okay with you talking to Kasso and such during the break, i understood you drove us and I was grateful to you, but at that moment I wanted to be selfish, yes.  And I *do* apologize for that. The seating arrangement wasn't exactly the best thing for anybody; some people don't care, some people did.  But the point is, I wasn't doing it to be a bitch to you on purpose.  As far as speaking to you condicendingly, yes, I do that because I feel that is how you treat me, so in retaliation, I too do the same.  of course, reading what you wrote, you do it because you think I do it first.  So of course that is a misunderstanding.  That's the way it has always been. I have, for the past lot of time, felt like you ignored me, treated me like a child, and generally a jerk.  So what did I do? Treated you with an edge.  I admit my personality is not on the nice side to, well, anyone.  My acting bitchy has never been a good thing, sure, but that's the way I am in the same way you tend to be obstinant and rude.  I'm not trying to be like "i'm right and you are wrong" but looking at the big picture, I think we both have the same problems.  We're both rude by nature, we both assume the other is purposely being an asshole just to us, and we both retaliate back.  Oh, and we both fail to realize that we come off that way from the start and then wonder why all of a sudden the other is making snide comments.  I mean, for a recent example, I totally didn't mean it in a rude way when I asked if you had directions.  I simply wanted to know if it had been found how to get ther and if we should get directions or not.  It wasn't meant like "YOU should get directions."  Not to mention the fact that I was unaware about the tough day you had had and the tire ordeal and whatnot, just like you were unaware that I couldn't see from the place I was standing.  I don't think I am always a bitch to you, and if you feel that way, then I am sorry.  Last week when we went to find bubble wrap was just fine, was it not?  Of course specific incidents are bitchy, but that is with *everyone*.  It's okay if you think I am a bitch, you are entitled to that, just as I em entitled to what I think of you, right? I just hope you understand that I was never out to get you intentionally or anything like that.    Alright well, this probably didn't ocme out the way I meant for it to either, cause everything else sounds like I am all mad, but it's not that way necessarily.
