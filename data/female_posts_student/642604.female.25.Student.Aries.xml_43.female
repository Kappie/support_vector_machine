The guy who just won the Tony award for best actor is an actor in Hairspray... and he's up on stage thanking John Waters for creating such wonderful characters for men to play.... I HATE JOHN WATERS! I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM! I wonder if this actor has seen a little movie called Pink Flamingos.... if so he would never be saying this... WHATEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [ Sun Jun 08, 09:31:21 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] I hate it when I get sick because I get like ten times more irrational and emotional. It's like last night I wasn't sure I wanted to go out because I was sick and feeling like shit. But I had promised a friend (hereafter known as sad friend) who was upset that I would go out with her so she could get plastered. So when one friend (hereafter known as ex-roommate) calls on Friday who I haven't seen in a while calls me and tells me she wants to go out, I say I can't because I promised sad friend I would go with her. Then my sister wants me to come out clubbing which sounds like fun and I keep thinking I can take sad friend cause she likes that club and she would have a good time and then I could hang with my sister and her friends. Then I talk to my other friend (hereafter known as... fuck it, Eric) on Friday and essentially tell him I am going to this club and I am taking sad friend. So he assumes I am already going and just want him to come along, anyway, he says he will call me Saturday. So finally Saturday rolls around and around seven I decide I do want to go out that night because I am restless despite my nagging cold. So I wait to hear from sad friend. Meanwhile all along I am getting IMs from my sister begging me to come and I keep saying probably but I have to talk to sad friend or Eric first. I am beginning to get nervous around nine because I haven't heard from any of them so after trying Eric once more and after Caitlin calls Eric because she really wants me to come out, I decide to try sad friend. I call sad friend who states that she was going to call me... (WHEN????) and we would go out next weekend. FIRST OF ALL, SHE BEGGED ME TO DO SOMETHING! SECOND I CANCELLED PLANS FOR HER! AND THIRD SHE'S MAKING IT SOUND LIKE SHE'S DOING ME A FAVOR BY RESCHEDULING FOR NEXT WEEK! I just say fine and hang up. So for another hour I wait around and hope someone will call cause in all honesty I don't want to drive to D.C. by myself. I finally retire myself to bed and I am sad for the rest of the night because I was doing someone a favor and got screwed out of a Saturday night because of it. So I wake up this morning feeling even worse than last night, no matter how much I do what I am supposed to this cold is getting worse. And Eric calls, it's like two in the afternoon and I have to be somewhere at five. I decide that it would be better to stay home and after finding out that he went out to the club with another friend of ours without calling me I was a little hurt. So I say I'm not going out with him, hang up and sit for a few minutes. Then I start to realize that fuck it, I do want to go out. So I call him back and he's already turned off his cell phone. I leave him a message. Then I feel even worse cause now I want to get out. I don't hear from him and try him a few more times. Then I call and say I will be done with this thing I have to do tonight around 8 if he wants to meet me for coffee. Then I don't hear from him, and I figured I wouldn't cause he never checks his cell phone. Anyway, so now I am at home feeling bad because I was angry at Eric for no reason and it was just displaced anger from sad friend. I was completely irrational in my sadness and the fact that I spent all day wallowing in my own misery I created. Now that I have had a moment to reflect I think I should be angry at sad friend still, and I am. And I've just called and left Eric yet ANOTHER message on his cell phone to let him know I was sorry for being angry at him even though he had no idea I was angry at him... it was a long rambling message, but I feel better now. And what's worse was if I had just gathered the courage to go out on my own last night I could've met them all there but because I was feeling sorry for myself I screwed myself. On top of it all, once again I made way too much out of nothing. AHHH!!!! There, I feel better.    [ Sun Jun 08, 04:09:32 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] So I was flipping through my magazine and it had a short blurb on the upcoming Young Hollywood Vanity Fair Cover Shoot, which has people like the Olsen Twins, Amanda Bynes, Mandy Moore, etc. Anyway, what I found so humourous about this was that it told that Hillary Duff, who annoys the crap out of me and I've only ever seen her in commercials (imagine what she could do if I saw this show on Disney she's on), brought her boyfriend Aaron Carter (Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter's little brother) to the shoot. And some girl there had recently broken up with him and people were screaming and crying because he was there and then Hillary threw a fit cause he was asked to leave. These three kids involved are aparently only like fifteen years old. OH MY GOD! This just reminded me what rejects we all are at fifteen and on top of that what even bigger rich and famous kids are at fifteen. All I have to say is... I feel for the other girls who had to be there. I bet Mandy Moore was wishing she wasn't a part of young hollywood at the moment.
