Went to Alex's sweet 16 on friday it was a lot of fun. I got my first deep rescue on Wednesday July 14th in Shot Gun Falls! Brittany Hope was 203 so she was there when I got it, she was very very happy for me! I was so excited, I was shaking so much when I got out of the water with the lady. The lady's top fell off so that was a little  awkward    but oh well. I was really excited. Ok well that's all for now. I am GOING to bring my pillow even if I have to carry it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        ~~Mel~~
