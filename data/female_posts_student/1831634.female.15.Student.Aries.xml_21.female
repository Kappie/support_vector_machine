Day 1: Friday Events - we got the project.  we watched the one hour photo thing.  I formed semi-ties with Su and Melanie.  (or so I thought)  Deanna told me she was working with Meng.  Went to lunch and tied myself to Kailing.  got home, called Meng, and somehow gave her impression that she was working with me.  Attached - Su, Melanie, Meng, Kailing Detached - no one Rejected - no one  Day 2 and 3: Weekend Events - got online and chatted like the apocalypse. Attached - Chuan Detached - Su Rejected - forgot  Day 4: Monday Events - mass chaos ensues.  6th, 7th, 8th get assignment.  more chaos. Attached - Didy, it seemed Detached - Didy, it seemed Rejected - Didy, it seemed  Day 5: Tuesday Events - masses of ppl asking, more chaos, deadline draws near... Attached - Jack Detached - Melanie detached herself... or so it seemed. Rejected - hoards of ppl.    Day 6: Wednesday Events - Mel didn't seem to have left after all... and more chaos.  and anger now.  grr. Attached - Didy Detached - Meng and Deanna. Rejected - even more ppl.  In all, rejected: Didy once, Monica, Su, Lisa Wang, Bing, Jeff Shi, Meng, Deanna, Harry Shen, Valerie, Perini, Grace Chang, Melanie.  and probably more.  T_T  *sigh*  on a brighter note...  MRS STANTON IS PREGNANT!!  AND SHE'S TEACHING AT JASPER NEXT YEAR!!  =DDDDD  ++sunny
