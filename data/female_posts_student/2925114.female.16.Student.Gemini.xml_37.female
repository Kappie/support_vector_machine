But Age is going through a break up right now and I need to be home..bad. I miss Chris alot. I don't know when I'll be home.blah. I'm missing Waterfront right now and tomorrow as well. While i stay here in Hamilton...drifting away from civilization. All I can do is make cd's and sleep. Oh and shop, which has definaltey lost it's lustre.   eeewww yeast infection comercial on tv. Why do they feel the need to do that. Oh and the other day I saw a rather riveting commercial as well. ABOUT HERPES. Honestly. I love how the woman is in the ad with her husband, as if she didnt get herpes grom sleeping around. whatever.  Saw Spiderman 2 today. Meh, it was good dont get me wrong but i havent had a huge reaction to a movie since Pirates. And the second one wont come out till im 18. I was gonna borrow someones ID and go clubbing with my step sister tonight but that didnt happen...apparantly the place theyre going to is reallyreally strict about ID's.   Can't wait till Chris's birthday...yah I've done my shopping...king of the world or what??? I need to find out how much hes going to like it tho, so igotta be sneaky muahah. still need to buy a little something else though. I really would say what it is because i want the world to kno but there is a 4% chance that he'll read this..actually he wont i guaruntee it. but just incase....    I hate break ups. Like there is no such possible thing as good break up. I hate it when people say its okay..we're on good terms...it was a "good" break up. WHATEVER we all know your miserable deal with it!! just put it out there so that your not lying to the world, if your sad and lonely tell soemone...dont try to act like your ex wasnt a dick.  Man I'm a bitch soemtimes...lol. Jebus I wanna go home. theres no place like home.... theres no place like home...cahrazy.  LO freaking L!! hahaha Chris called me last night drunk...so funny. Oh my. It was great.. Miss yah Squishy! and Winifred to ;)hhahaah  Geeeeez I so wanna say what i got him...grrrrrr.. But now the chance of him reading this is higher, he cmae online for a sec and i told him i was writing this so he may read it...probably not...WAHAHA  Well I'm gonna go, I hope to write alot more often because I havent done this in while, it was fun, slates clean again...for now. muaha. byebye  oops actually I'm gonna show you the playlist for my aweosme cd that I love that I just made! :D Bye~!!!!!!!!!  1)Taste of Ink - The Used 2)Time - Pink Floyd 3)About a Girl - Nirvana 4)I Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd *song of the day 5)Sic Transit Gloria - Brand New 6)Nevermind - Nirvana 7)Iris - Goo Goo Dolls 8)Broken - Seether and Amy Lee (LOVE LOVE LOVE IT) 9)You Know Your Right - Nirvana 10)Champagne Supernova - Oasis 11)Money - Pink Floyd 12)Polly - Nirvana 13)Knocking on Heavens Door - Led Zepplin and Pink Floyd 14)Mother - Pink Floyd (heard Chris play it so much I had to download it (illegally)) :D                                                                            .:ness:.
