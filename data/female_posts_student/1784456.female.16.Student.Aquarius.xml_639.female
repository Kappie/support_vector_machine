So we were pigging out of strawberries! The place it was at was soooo lush! They hired out the whole downstairs so we could go every where! Then the people brought out real food and I started pigging out on lush sausages! Rick kept eating bread, lots of it! Oooh, it was really nice and I loved Sarah's dress, she made it herself and it had all these fiddily beads every where. That was really nice, and we actually met David! (Sarah's now husband) cause we hadn't met him before. Sarah and David met at a bus stop! And then Sarah placed this add in a 'I saw you' thingy in the paper. Aww, isn't that just perfect? The second wedding we went to was Dan and Karen's and they've know each other for 10 years! Since they were 12!!! Wow! Hehe, my brother gave Dan the middle of the tardis thingy! (The console!) Hehe, I don't think Karen will be too happy. She had a lush dress too, it was massive! Eugh, I've gotta do washing up now... :( :( :(
