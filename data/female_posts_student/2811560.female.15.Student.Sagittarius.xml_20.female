It would be better if we could just eat lunch and then go home. Anyways, East Ensemble sucked yet again. We worked on "Shoshone Love Song" which I volunteered to play the piano for. That was a really bad decison. There's some really funky chords, and my fingers just didn't work today. Ugh. It was really bad. Then, to make matters worse, we choreographed more of "Razamajazz". Again, not fun. I honestly don't know why I'm still in East Ensemble. I hate it.  Yeah, so today in Spanish, A.J. and I were talking about band, and suddenly before I know it, everyones giving me crap about how we didn't actually win state and how we didn't make finals. I was this close to decking every single one of them. Grr. Not to mention we did win state. So tomorrow, I'm supposed to be doing three things after school. 1- One Act rehearsal, 2- Contest Play Set Construction, 3- Spring Play Workshop. I haven't actually decided which I'm going to yet. I figure I can probably get out of One Acts considering the size of my part. I should go to set construction because its the first meeting, but then I'll have to miss the workshop, and if I miss the workshop, that means I'll have to go tomorrow which means I'll miss East Ensemble, which means that Ms. Gibson will murder me. Hmm. There's something to ponder.
