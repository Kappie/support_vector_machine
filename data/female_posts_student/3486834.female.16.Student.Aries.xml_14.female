And so we left around 4:oo or something.. drove for a lonnnngg time and then we got to my aunt's house around 1:00 in the morning. Thank god we got there cause I needed some sleep. It was the first time I slept since Monday... I slept hard, but then I woke up at like 7:00 am. So I only got a few hours of sleep, but it was better than nothing... I haven't seen any of my old friends yet, at least I have called them. hah. I just got off of the phone with Emily.. We probably won't do anything until Monday or something cause Amanda is about to go out of town to California for two weeks... so you know they have to hang out with eachother before she leaves.. Hahah and I am not invited. I understand, cause Amanda hates me. I think today is Friday, but I am not too sure. That means that Yaya's and Lauren's birthday was yesterday. I wish I could've been in town for Yaya's birthday *sighs*. My aunt's MSN isn't working, and none of my family has AIM... *tear* lol. So like if you are reading this you should e-mail me. My mom said that the only chance of me making money is working at my granddad's restaurant. I had planned on her saying that. The only problem is that i would have to stay with him to go to work with him every morning.. ugh.. So I am not sure if I am going to make any money this summer.. I may just try to think of something else later. OMFG before I went out of town I wrote a poem.. haha yeah it was cool. But the poem is so totally lame. I want to learn how to play guitar.. that would be tyte (sorry I don't quite know where that came from). It would give me something to do, cause I am really really REALLY bored. I think Paxton and Trevor are mad at me.. lol.. I think it was Wednesday when I was talking to them on MSN.. and I ask them what they are doing.. They go 'We are taking turns making out with ur mom'.. haha so I said 'omg guys my mom just read what you wrote.. i g2g i am in so much trouble' haha so I got back on a few minutes later and they were all worried that they were gunna get in trouble and I told them I was joking and they called me gay. lol.. so yeah. hehe oops. I miss everyone soo much and I can't wait til I come home, that will be the day. My mom is planning on staying out of town for a month. This is gunna suck BIG ones.....! I have no clue what she plans on doing for that long. Oh yeah and we are gunna move into another house. Ask if you want to know the story. It's really sad... but I dunno, it may be tyte moving into another place, even tho I like our house. hmm.. too bad. I'm gunna go to Blockbusters. *kiss*
