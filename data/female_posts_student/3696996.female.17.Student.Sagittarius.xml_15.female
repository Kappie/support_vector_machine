I'm gonna go play pool tonight with my sis and   maybe beat/pick up some guys, lol. I was gonna go with a bunch of my friends but it didn't work   out. If anyone sees this and wants to join call my cell (978)-853-8065...We'll be at Country Club    USA in Chelmsford. It's not actually a country club, it's a pool hall. I am in the most boring   mood right now it sux...It'll be better once I'm playing pool. Tomorrow I'm going to my   grandparents church to sing for my grandfather's retirement, he played the organ at their church   for a long time. After that I think I'll go to this bible study this woman at my church has on   Sundays. She came up to me last week and asked me to go, it sounds ok.   Monday I'm going to   the Lake Champion Slide Show. After that this week is up in the air, I guess I should start on   my other summer reading list book. There you go the most boring entry ever.
