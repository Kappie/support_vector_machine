That and the fact that I had a really stressful week, so I'm gonna take some much needed R+R. Cold coffee isn't good if you were expecting it to be hot... X-P The drama banquet is this week, that'll be really fun. I just feel like I ought to have some sort of escort or something, you know, like the Oscars. I mean, I'm not up for any awards or anything, but it would still be fun to go with someone. I know who I'm thinking of, but that just makes me want to ask him even less... you know? I don't want to seem like I'm flirting or anything... so I'll pretty much just end up not going with my friends, just sitting with them. Oh well, it's all good. Maybe I can finally go get those sun glasses today... not that they'll do much good in this weather...damn clouds. Oh well. It's all good. Wow, I just said that. Oh well...ummm, yeah. :-P Kristin
