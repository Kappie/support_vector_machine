After work it starting raining and i wanted to go for a run then but i kinda felt sick so i waited and then by the time i went it stopped. It was really humid out tho. i ran 3 miles.. and then went swimming. Steve (guy from England) kinda scared me cause i was under water and when i came up he asked me something. Then they got into a water fight with John. that was pretty funny.   and now.. i have water in my ear (hence the name of the entry or w.e. i'm even doing now) and the plumber just finished looking at my water heater because my shower gets cold and my dad has to turn it on and off. thankfully i've only had to take one cold shower. maybe i just wont shower untill it's fixed haha   Tom Petty- Girl on LSD  ..which reminds me of good times with carissa =) who wants to do something tonight so maybe ill write again if that happens.
