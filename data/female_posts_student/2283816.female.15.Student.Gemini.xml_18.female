It alllll began last night, when I attempted to download the Most Popular Theme from themes.org.... Naturally I was unsuccessful. Then this message pops up... "Windows File Protection: Files that are required for Windows to run properly have been replaced by unrecognized versions. To maintain system stability, Windows must restore the original versions of these files. Insert your Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1 CD now." The theme is all messed up - the start bar is half silver, half the green, half old windows...and in a different font. I restarted the computer fifty million times and when I clicked on a button nothing loaded. When I tried to log on to my dad's account, it rebounded back to the main screen.   Right now, it's working moderately well, but the message is still up and I don't know where to look for the CD because my dad isn't home. *sighs deeply*
