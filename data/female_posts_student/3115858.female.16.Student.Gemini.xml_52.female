(conor was supposed to come over--we were going to call michiko...but that was the next day, and there was no way it was going to happen anymore. i was SOOO FUCKIN PISSED! that would've been the last time i could've talked to michiko before conor left...and the last time i could've seen him before he left. i'm so angry. i don't think i'll be able to talk directly with her for a very, very long time.)  she makes me extremely angry very often. sometimes i really want to beat the shit out of her. but i wouldn't. i'm not like that. i want to be a good sister to her. i want her to learn easily what i had to learn the hard way. sometimes easily doesn't happen...  for instance: at dinnertime, after i was done getting yelled at (again), i informed my mom that my sister's best friend's mom was allowing my sister to use a phone card to call this dude ("crash") in stoughton (which is a bazillion miles away from here) whom she considers her "boyfriend." (not.) i have never believed that it was in her place to allow my sister to do that, when my mom had specifically disallowed that. so i narked on my sister.  i made her "lose a friend." but neither my mom nor i think that she should be around those conniving types.  i got back, in a way...but i don't feel good about it. i think we're even. i think.  okay. so this i probably my last post before i leave tomorrow. chicago tomorrow, south dakota saturday (for a week), then off to glacier national park in montana(for however long we're staying there). hopefully i'll have some sort of compy access during the trip...but i'm not counting on it.  i'll need a lot of the spree to keep me...well...close to sane. this trip is going to suck. it doesn't matter that we're going to the most beautiful place in the whole country...  god i hope there are some hot guys there.
