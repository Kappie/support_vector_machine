Hmm... saw Van Helsing today and it wasn't quite as bad as I thought it was going to be. *shrug* My sister hated the girl in it though and I have to agree she was pretty annoying... especially her clothes. Werewolves are hot so that was good ;) and Hugh Jackman isn't so bad either ;) all in all worth seeing at the dollar movie theatre.  In other news: my first Varsity Volleyball tournament tomorrow... unfortunatley the bus leaves at 7:30 am :( gross and early. I am  not  a morning person.
