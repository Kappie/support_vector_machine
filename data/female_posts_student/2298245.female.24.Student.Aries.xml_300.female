My going out on a limb for Best Actor backfired, but as Sean Penn was very gracious in his acceptance speech, only throwing in one joking reference to the lack of WMDs to be found in Iraq, I am willing to not be too upset about this.  I think he probably deserved it more anyway.    Lord of the Rings  won everything, so the few times I strayed from that strategy didn't pay off too well.  I really didn't think it would win for Screenplay, and on Costumes...what can I say.  I also missed on some of the other categories, most notably Documentary - but in retrospect, I should have chosen  Fog of War  instead.    All in all I found the awards show to be very boring.  There were no surprises, but there were some funny moments along the way, and watching it with friends never hurts.  Perhaps I will have more to say on it later.  Right now I have to get to work.   UPDATE :  I predicted 17 categories correctly, by my count.  Those I missed:  Best Actor (Sean Penn), Best Documentary Feature (Fog of War), Best Documentary Short (Chernobyl Heart), Best Animated Short (Harvie Krumpet), Best Costume Design (Lord of the Rings), Best Cinematography (Master  Commander), Best Adapted Screenplay (Lord of the Rings).
