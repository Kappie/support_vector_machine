It is amazing how any little thing can remind you how much you miss your old boyfriend.  I just wish I had him here with me right now.  After I waited there like 5 hours I went home and when I got home the air conditioner wasnt working it like froze up or something but all I know is I broke a sweat just walking in the house it was hot, the carpet was hot.  I then watched tv and fixed the air and was ok I guess still not cool but getting there.  I watched Summerland, and OMG that show was so sad today and it made my mind wonder again about how happy I would be right now if I was still with Keith.  I know he is gone but I miss him more and more everyday it is not enough just talking with him on the phone every night before we go to bed I want to see him every night.  I just hope that one day I will truly be happy again and not trying to make myself happy just to put on a front with my friends.  This is prolly stupid and ppl are prolly like well you need to get over him but I dont care b/c they are not me.   Love ya'   Jess
