Gaia Online is currently down for repair.  A power outage had caused many servers to be down and we're in the process of bringing everything back up. We hope to be on-line at 6:30 pm PST.   Thank you for your patience.   ARGHHH!!! PATIENCE!!! what the hell is that?!! growl.  you know how last night there was that whole hockey thing?? well I have a "friend"  who finds that extremely funny!! argh. I blocked her. yes yes I did. call me overly sensitive but the guy broke the other guys spine!!!! he isnt paralyzed but he could very well have been. seriously you dont just smash someones head into the ice. that is soooooo idiotic and...argh....ok I am going...I have gotten myself all riled up...
