It was like I went for a week or something. Awesome.     What isn't awesome though, is the fact that summer is coming to a close much faster than expected. I still need to hang out with a few people more before they go away to college and I still want to do so much more. I almost wish I hadn't done the section leader thing for marching band because, it's creating a lot of problems. It's just really stressful. I don't like it as much as I thought I would.     I hate when that happens. When you have such high expectations for something and it just turns out completely different than you thought. I guess I'm not just talking about the section leader thing but just things in general. I think maybe I should make it a general rule to have low expectations. That way, I'm almost always pleased with what I get. Pessimistic? Yes, yes it is. But, that's ok. That glass has to be half empty at some point.
