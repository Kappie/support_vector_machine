They accompany you They're always there To talk to you To be with you To share your joy and your sorrow Your compliments And your tears  I don't know who they are behind the mysterious masks they're never really there they're always gone before I ever found them  Friends support, they cheer you on They did But I don't ever know.  So called Friends But never there When you're really in need for them They disappear in a puff of smoke Like in cartoons Like dreams Like a nightmare But not reality  Friends, my friends. The times when light is never there the times when sun always set the deserted dark street the mysterious nightmare  Tell me, oh tell me.  What are friends...  (This ain't true. This is the past. But now I'm sinking into boredom, thinking of the history. I don't know, this is something I always wonder. But in reality, they are there, so wake up, those who had this thinking. It's just that you don't know. Cherish, appreciate what you have...)
