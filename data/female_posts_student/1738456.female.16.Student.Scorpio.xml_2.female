The stones were large, curved and smooth. Most were dark brown, gray, or tan, but some were a weird shade of teal. I wondered if they weren’t really stones, but eggs. I tried not to step on them in case they were, and they cracked under my weight.  I stopped for a moment to see if I was still heading towards the castle. I didn’t want to loose sight of it. I had no idea if that was even where I wanted to go. While I was staring into the beautiful, lavender horizon, something poked at my leg. I looked down again, afraid of what I might see. To my surprised, a tiny baby bird, with purple fuzz, had poked its head out of what I had correctly assumed were eggs. I immediately leaned down to pat its head. It pecked furiously at my hand, crying out in a voice far too loud for a baby bird to have.  “Shit!” I snatched my hand back, and stood up, “I’ve got to remember not to touch things,” I reminded myself, and watched as more creatures emerged. Some were different color birds, and others looked like tiny moles and rabbits. All were shades of green, blue, pink, and purple that belonged under a black light. I stepped over their heads and continued walking. There were more birds than any other creature, and they pecked at my legs. I hopped from one leg to the other to reduced the pain. The animals with arms reached out and grabbed at my feet. Trying to topple me over I tried desperately to get away.  Something grabbed a hold my shoe, and yanked hard. I fell and landed hard on top of several creatures, whom promptly hurried back into the ground. I pulled myself up in time to watch my shoe, and all the animals disappear under their eggs again. I took off my other shoe and threw into the woods around me.  “Argh!” I screamed. Nothing, it seemed would ever go right for me here.
