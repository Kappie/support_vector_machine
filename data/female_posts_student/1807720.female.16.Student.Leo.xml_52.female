And well I spent HOURS and yes I mean HOURS studying for my social and preparing for the long answer and I spent a bit of time on math today but most of saturday I spend reviewing my math for the test tommorow.  I think I will studying a little bit more for the social tonight too cause I just still don't feel ready but well knowing all the time I spend I mean like yeah I probably am ready but last time I got a 75% on the long answer and like I know I am capable of like 90's and stuff and since the M.C. usually ain't my thing I've gotta do good on this.  And well I have to do good in social cause if I want to make honours and gotta have good marks...lol and well I am a little uncertain about math and chem right now but I am sure that everything will come along just fine - it will all be right with time!
