We decided we'd go over Friday, stay the night, and leave sometime on Saturday... and that's exactly what we did.  When I got to April's she hadn't been home long from band rehearsal with the Bobcat Band (SWTSU).  Anyhow, we decided to go get some stuff from the liquor store.  I mean, we both just turned 21 in July.  So we had to celebrate being of legal drinking age.  Anyway, we um, bought all kinds of stuff to have mixed drinks later that night.  We waited at April's till Ricky got there, and then we all went to eat at Chili's.  We had to wait awhile, but while we waited Ricky and I told April about Sealab 2021, and other shows that are on Adult Swim.  We finally got to our table, and April and I ordered Strawberry Margaritas.  April didn't drink hers because she doesn't like tequila.  Anyhow, I thought it was good.  :-)  We then finished eating, and went back to April's apartment, and after a little bit, April and I decided to make some stuff.  So, we decided to try the Banana stuff first.  YUMMY!  That's all I have to say about those Banana drinks we made.  They were AWESOME. We used banana puree and banana rum, and of course ice.  Ricky even tried some.  Then after we drank the banana stuff, we made strawberry drinks.  It's a TGIFriday's ready made stuff.  It has the vodka and rum in it already, all you do is add ice and blend it.  It was good too... it was called Strawberry Shortcake.  Now, Druck called while all this was going on to vent about various things.  Mostly someone he had a crush on.  Anyway, we had him on my cell phone speaker phone, and we were all laughing at things he was saying.  At one point he was talking about some person, and he yelled "That BITCH!"  and anyway, that became the phrase for the rest of the visit among all of us.  It was a great memory.  There was also a lot of funny stuff that happened.  Like me and April got giggly, and well, she was cold, or something.  One minute me and April were talking, and she had her drink in hand, and she was like, I'm cold.  Then I turned and said something to Ricky, and when I turned back to say something else to April, she had ONE GLOVE on to hold her drink.  HAHA  It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen!  I called her Michael Jackson.  Anyway, she showed us her Halloween costume.  Haha  It's a porn star costume!  It's a little honey bee, and she got it from a lingerie shop online.  Anyway, the bottoms are made so your ass can hang out!  HAHA  We all had a good long laugh about that.  Mostly because April was laughing really hard when she was showing it to us, and she kinda fell on the floor she laughed so hard.  Anyhow, after we had been drinking and joking around and laughing, we got tired. So we went to sleep.   April had some stuff to do the next day with her sorority (a breakfast, and then a meeting with a National chick later) so Ricky and I slept in.  We woke up when April got back from breakfast (and before her meeting) and we watched Cruel Intentions.  Well, Ricky watched it for awhile by himself, cause he hadn't ever seen it, and after April left and went to her meeting, I decided to take a shower.  Anyhow, after the movie was over and I had had my shower, Ricky and I got hungry, so we made scrambled eggs with cheese.  Okay, wait.  I MADE SCRAMBLED EGGS!  hehe  So, we ate, and then when April got back, she wanted a Krispy Kreme doughnut.  Her apartment complex has a convenience store, and they sell Krispy Kreme there.  So, we went down there, but alas it was closed.  Anyhow, we then watched some of the Sealab episodes (cause Ricky brought them on discs and stuff) and then me and April had some double vanilla coke.  We added vanilla rum to vanilla coke.  It was interesting.  I think I would've liked it more if it had been just regular coke we added vanilla to.  Anyway, April was still craving doughnuts... so she eventually settled for Cinnasticks.  It was Ricky's suggestion.  He said they were "F***ing Great!"  And that was that!  Well, after all the fun, when it was about 9, Ricky and I decided we should head home (to Austin and SA).  Ricky had given me some things to take to SA to his family for him.  Anyway, I called his house when I was almost there, and when I got there his Dad answered the door.  He wanted me to come watch The Count of Monte Cristo with him and Michael.  I declined, saying I had to go home because my parents were expecting me (and it was like, after 10pm).  Anyhow, he proceeded to yell, "Well, FINE!" and slam the door in my face, except then he opened it back up and said, "I'm just kidding with ya, Kelsie" in his very southern accent and chuckling through the entire "Just kidding" sentence.  It was funny.  Big 'Ol Billy makes me laugh.  So, I'm glad that we cheered April up.  I think the Yatta thing cheered her up the most, though!  And she can watch it anytime she gets a sad feeling.  "We are the wad of dough...!"
