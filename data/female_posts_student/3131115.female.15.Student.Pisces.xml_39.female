Everyone else I know, besides my dad can sleep in like any normal person. Although, I hear if you sleep in you're lazier and have less energy during the day. :-P there's a good side of it I guess. heh..but still I hate not being able to sleep in. Because then I'm up for hours doing THIS waiting for people to get on. By this I mean COMPLAINING. I'll never be happy.  Anyhow..I went to a wedding with Bill lastnight and had a lot of fun. Well, We didnt hear the wedding, because the people werent loud enough, and everyone was crowding around so we couldnt see the bride and groom. Grr..but oh well. The rest of the time Bill and I hung out with Adam and his girlfriend. His girlfriend was insanely cute and pretty..hehe. Bill thought so too, she's wicked short and young but she was cute as hell. We had fun with the two of them. I got a wicked bad migrain but bill's sweetheart aunt gave me pills. I love some of his family. His immediate family..pfft, I hate them. I love when Bill and I hang out together, It really is a lot of fun. It makes us closer. OH! Great news. I'm being put on birth control in two weeks so Bill and I can be alone again. Yayyy! :-D I'm so happy. I finally got it through to my mom that she needs to put me on it. Although, Im a little scared to get a papsmire or however the hell you spell it. I hate people seeing me naked..ewww.   I'm writing too much. I'm sorry. I have nothing else to do. Grr on myself. I want to go to Bills today but Im sick, so I dont think I'm going to. Besides, my dad already left to take my sister and that was my only ride. *sigh* anyway...Im still looking for a skin. I know, it's taking me a really long time. :-/..It's hard to find one that I like. Actually..I found one, but then I couldnt get the code for it, so that was a waste of my time. I really want to go to the other site and look at ashleys posts. I always want to but I never do. Maybe I'm afraid of something..who knows. I think I might really go this time though. I miss her believe it or not.   Amanda Hodge e-mailed Bill after I told her that I didnt want them talking. But anyhow, she e-mailed him and TOLD him "you best call me". Bill doesnt think that it's that big of a deal, but to me it is. He was trying to make excuses for it. He said "well maybe she e-mailed you asking for permission" I said.. "obviously not if I didnt GET one and EMAIL her back giving her permission because she did it anyway" and then bill said "well she probably thought you were going to be here anyway" and I was like "yeah..do you REALLY believe that? You know..She's doing this behind my back" Bill said "well I havent talked to her, she probably doesnt think that I'm mad at her" I was like "I TOLD HER NOT TO TALK TO YOU BUT SHE STILL IS TRYING TO GET YOU TO!" and then he got mad..I mean, seriously..She's obviously doing it behind my back and it's pissing me right the fuck off. I mean I talk to her sometimes, but like..that doesn't mean that I'm going to trust her. She's like FLIPPING out because we talked for like 2 seconds, she might think that that's permission for her to talk to him or some shit, who knows. Grr..People make me extremely mad.  I kind of miss having Ashley around. Not only did she make me happy, but she made Bill happy too. Well, for the most part. The only thing that really went wrong was the fact that Ashley was never a part of anything. I mean, we were always doing things without her, and that wasnt really our choice. We wanted her to be a PART of us..WITH us. heh..It's so weird. Im like thinking back on everything, and how the two of us "met" is pretty funny. hehe...It makes me giggle. I miss waking up next to her beautiful face. aww..I need to stop. I'm going to make myself cry.  Ashley if you read this..I miss you A LOT   Anyway..I think I'm going to try and find another skin AGAIN. I'll probably end ALL of my posts with this same sentence. :-P...Bye bye Bloggie. I LOVE YOU!
