If I had it to do over again, I would have worn contacts today, because let me tell you, glasses, which have long been my means of overcoming Darwinism, in fact are a hindrance in the rain. And there was rain today. And thunder and lightening. It was a little bit terrifying. I felt the wrath of God, which is normally something I like to avoid. Maybe tomorrow I'll take the bus. It'll save me some wrath.  Melissa invited me over for dinner today. Very tasty, and good company. Melissa always leaves me feeling more centered. It's nice to hang out with someone who I'm not holding back from... or at least mostly. I don't let most people to get very close to me. It takes a lot of long term bonding for me to feel secure enough to let leash some of my more biting criticism. I'm actually a very judgemental and critical person, but I try to work on that. I'm also easily cowed by people who I think are judging me, and I'm often hyper-aware of being seen by people around me. It's a little weird. I just need to get over it. But often it causes me to spend more time on my outfit and outward appearance than you may think. Interesting to think about.
