Even if you do know what you are feeling, it's difficult to bring these feelings out into the open where they can impact the directional changes you are making.   It's as if you are heading in one direction, yet all the circumstances in your life are pulling you astray. You are not being pulled off track. You are exactly where you need to be at this time, even if you think you are working too hard.     I knew it!  I had a good day. I rarely have one of those- time to celebrate!  So that's my weak attempt at a haiku. But I did have an excellent day. I feel kinda giddy (Lisa, did you slip me some Celexa or something?) My boss loves me. My co-workers tolerate me, and I them. And I had some chocolate cake.  Take one more piece of my big ass, Dr. Atkins- it was so damn gooooooooooooooooooood.   Nyah, nyah, a boo boo.
