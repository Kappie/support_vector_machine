"she looks like a llama." "i tell her that she's not funny everyday... and she still thinks i'm kidding?"  liz. i [heart] you. thanks for always trying to make me feel better about... stuff... please forgive me if i got any of those quotes slightly wrong (i probably did...). you're always there for me to talk to in math class, and you always have good advice. thanks times 37568942.  ...i'm outtie now.  when love reached beneath her plaid jumper, pulled out a switch blade and drove it... directly through the heart of st angeles.  kayte.
