I think. But, anyway, I'm gonna be going to the store w/ my mom so I can't really type much. So, I need to take a shower. Isn't that grosse? It's almost 6:00 p.m. and I haven't taken a shower yet...(ok...maybe I shudn't hav sed that). But, I dunno. I called my buddy P-bear (the nick my friend Alescia made 4 him) and he wudn't home. Ya know, I miss skool. At least then, I actually had something to do. Ugh. Now I'm just sittin' next to this freaking 1984 edition comp that's about to break down. I need a life. I NEED some friends. *sigh I NEED 2 take a shower. For god sakes, I'm a GIRL! hehe. Well, I wonder if my P-bear called me back. Most likely, he didn't. He was out playin' basketball w/ his cousins. *sigh...everything is gonna be A-O-K (you have 2 read that in letter form 2 get it)         So...gotta go...     Yes...I'm going to the store with my sis and mom. UGH! Who likes going to the grocery store w/ family? Not me. I'm tired and cicadas are swarming in my tree in front of the house. I'll try to blog lata. Otha than that...I'm out. Peace 2 the Mid-East. That is, if u live in the Mid-East...uhh...yea.
