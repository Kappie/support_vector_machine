It was pretty average.   Wind Ensemble, did nothing. Alstadt just talked about the paintball thing. I don't think I'm going. No siree. Those paintballs hurt I bet! Besides, Then music theory, I didn't have my composition with me, and Alstadt gave me this look. Man is he good at making me feel guilty. He can seriously make anyone feel guilty. OK, maybe I'm just a wimp and he makes me feel guilty, but still. I hate it. It drives me crazy. He shouldn't be allowed to make me feel so terrible. He's not as bad as Mr. Semanic though.   Alstadt also did something else pretty crummy today. I'm really losing faith in him. They finally had the B auditions, and Brett didn't get first chair. Matt did. Now, that's pretty messed up considering Brett used to be in Wind Symphony, and probably should have been this year. Matt really isn't all that good. No offense, but...he really isn't. He's ok, but Brett deserved first chair more. I think Mr. A just gave Matt first chair because his parents are in Band Boosters and whatnot. It's all pretty sad.   But what dissapointed me more than Alstadt was Matt. Matt's pretty good friends with Brett, and yet, after school, Matt kept telling everyone and basically rubbing it in. Right after school he came up to me and said, "Hey, go make fun of Brett." I, of course ask, "Why?" and he says, "Because I beat him for first chair, he's pretty mad, go make fun of him!" What? Go make fun of him? Matt, what are you ON? Why would you do that to a friend? Why, that's really mean. He obviously feels bad. Rubbing it in isn't going to exactly make it all better. You have a strange way of cheering people up.   Brett's such a nice kid. I wish there were more people like Brett in the world. I really think we'd be better off. Oh well. Such is life.  Wow, anyway, Chemistry was boring. I completely bombed that chemistry test yesterday. Whoops. Oh well, I guess it has to happen once this semester. I've actually been doing well in chemistry, actually been doing my homework. I usually can't bother to do homework. I think it's because Mr. K scares me SO much. He yells a lot, and...eeeks. Diane and I really don't like him sometimes. He's a meany pooface.   Hm, Health was ok. Kelly and I made up a story about hepatitis. Hehe. It was about a kid named Johnny who got hepatitis from shooting Heroin. It was fun to write. I love Kelly. She's so...I don't know. She really puts me in a good mood when I see her. YaY for Kelly. Hmmm, we also talked about pregnency in Health, and problems during pregnency. It was actually kind of a downer. Grr.  Speech, we did nothing. Dani and I played with the silly puddy I made in Chemistry (forgot to say we made silly puddy. Mine was blue. YaY!) I did ok on my speech yesterday. She said it was my best yet, but...I got marked down for my time. I went under the time limit. Grrr. Oh well. Hmmm, I talked to Will about Finding Nemo. He's such a cool kid. He really makes me smile. He's so honest too. He'll tell you exactly what he's thinking. I guess that's not good in some situations, but at least he's honest.  Lunch was good. Joanne and John sat with us, and Scott, and Mary Clare. Wow...lots more people I like. I can totally be myself around Joanne. I can joke and be silly with her, but I also really trust her. I'm not sure why, but I do. John. Well, I actually don't know John that well sadly, but Joanne certainly likes him. Wow does she like him. :) Hehe. Scott's just always a cool kid. It was his birthday. Joanne and I sang for him. Whoopi! Mary Clare is ALWAYS so cheerful. She always makes me smile. NO MATTER WHAT! She's also really honest, like Will, and she's funny. Then of course, Kelly and Emilly and Brett were there. I've already said Kelly rocks my world. Emily's so nice, and...she's just always happy too. She cheers me up a lot, and she's really trustworhy. Brett is such a nice guy. He's a gentleman, and you don't see many nice guys anymore. I wish there were more. *Sigh* Oh well. I just love my lunch gang. They are all so awesome. I always leave lunch feeling good, even when we have a big debate, like today. We were debating about abortion and the death penalty. It was fun.   So, then math. Blah. I brought Kristen's math book by accident so I had to ask mr. Madsen if I could go back to my locker. Eeeek, he scares me. He just gives me this look and says, "If you MUST," like always. So, while I'm in there, I run into Chris G., and he says he'll fix my locker for me. Another gentleman! YES! He seems like such a nice kid, but I don't know him too well. So, the rest of math I just sat and did this review packet. I actually knew what I was doing. Shock shock.  Government, we took a test. I don't know how I did on it. I feel I did ok. I know I missed at least 1, and we got the quiz back from yesterday that I thought I bombed. 11/13. Not bad. Not bad. Also...we got our test scores back from like...a week ago that he's been telling us for days he would "bring them tomorrow." Yeah, I got an A on it. YES! I felt so happy. It was awesome, because I got a higher grade than both Kelly and Kathryn, and they're SO smart. It drives me crazy. I guess it felt good to be the best for once.  So, that was my...umm...crazy day? Haha, I'm asking Dave about punctuation now. It's really not my strong suit.   Man, I hate having such poor punctuation skills. It's pooey!! Grrrr.   Maybe I'll write more later. I actually had fun writing for once. YaY! Wow, I love saying YaY!  X o X o The Brown Crayon X o X o
