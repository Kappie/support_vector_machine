In this blog I'm living my ideal future. I adore it. I've even made friends in my future city. I'm kind of smirky about it. It's a brilliant plan, I can even switch over once I (hopefully) get to that point.    Have you ever noticed that while watching British sit-coms around midnight the advertisments for community colleges, birth control, "single hot-lines" and "provide a life for your baby, choose abortion" wait...adoption, increase?  Actual Historical Events:  Last night I watched that new Fox show North Shore, I'm horrible desperate for summer shows, I couldn't help but be annoyed by that woman. The sex interest. I automatically hate. everything. about. her. Today I didn't do laundry. Again. I've managed not to do the laundry for several weeks by now. I'm running out of underwear. But the real stopping point is when I run out of pants.   Future Tense:     Tomorrow, someone's whoms codename shall be Veronica, is coming over and we're going to have our own LGBT film festival. I'm bitterly dissapointed that I loaned out all my Queer as Folk dvds. I could have forced her to watch some. All this means that I'll have to clean my room. I should also go out and look for a job. Maybe. Maybe not...
