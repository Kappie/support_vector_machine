If a strange person called James comes on to the website I know who he is.  So do not panic.  I will explain at school.    Please can you send me the poem about Blob, as it will be intresting to read.  I totaly forgot to tell Letty about our class setting the fire alarm off!  Oh well I'll just have to phone her what a shame.  Right toodle trundle!!
