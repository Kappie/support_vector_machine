Not because others do it and influence me.  Not because I saw it in a move and thought it was fucking groovy or stylish.  I do it because I can, because I want to, because I'm free, because I live in a wonderful country where free speech is one of my rights and duties. I do it simply because it's the way I naturally express myself sometimes.  Don't give me shit about it.
