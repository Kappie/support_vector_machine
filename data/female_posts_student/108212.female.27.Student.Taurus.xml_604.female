We perused BestBuy's circle of Digital Cams compared Sony with this Panasonic DV cam. I played around with the SonyCam smacked it up, flipped it, rubbed it down...then Dot calls me over to the other side of the circle.  Dot was playing with a Panasonic Brand. This particular model had similar functions as the SonyCam but it had something that Sony didnt.  SIZE!  Panasonic's mini size cam made Dot fall in love with it.  So much for all that research for Sony.  (Net makes motion of throwing out research papers on Sony Cam).  With that lets take a closer look at this Dot Cam before she buys it....      size not to scale   more to come...  ~Net
