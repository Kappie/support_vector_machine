I like the seniority, but I don't like knowing that at the end of the school year, I'll hardly see any of these people again, and that after this year is COLLEGE!  oh well... I went shopping with Mark today.  We both wanted to get some shoes, but couldn't find the ones we want.  I got to talk to my friend from Auburn today! It was so cool. I've known this girl since I was in first grade, and I got an e-mail from her today.  She's going to AU this year.  What a crazy thought... I made my senior shirt and decorated my car tonight.  I'm so happy about tomorrow :) It's going to be great...
