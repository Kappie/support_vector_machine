I came home in a wonderful mood, filled with me singing along (off key and on the top of my lungs, of course) to fun, fast paced music. I get the mail and theres this big packet for me.  Turns out one of our teachers reccomended me for the National Student Leadership Conference.  it essentially is a grouping of small workshops that you can attend.  some of them look really cool, but i digress.  it was really cool being reccomended for something.  typically it seems that i never get noticed, i do things and they slip under the radar.  so i'm all happy and i go find my dad to tell him about it.  He cuts me off midstream with a line like "why don't you do something usefulnow and maybe we can talk later?"  granted the house did need cleaning and my mom deserted but it really pissed me off.  why is it that my news is secondary to cleaning the house for my grandparents?  so right now i feel like i hate my parents as well as my grandparents.  if we could have had thanksgiving there i wouldn't have had to spend my week cleaning and my parents would not be quite so bitchy. this rant is done...sorry had to get it out of my system.
