She took me to our little campsite thingy which was kinda cute and cozy.  Becky had brought a tent and all the sleeping bags were inside.  We had a couple of coolers filled with drinks and snacks, which surprisingly not a lot of people ate.  They had the survivors walk first thing and Rebecca's friend Audrey walked that.  Audrey was diagnosed with lymphoma last year and since then has done chemo and the cancer has thankfully gone into remission.  When I found out that someone my age had gotten cancer, it really hit home.  How scary that must have been for her, I was amazed my her courage to just talk about it like it was the most normal thing, which by this time, I suppose it is.    At about 3 am, we had no one walking because all of us were just too tired.  The rules are, you're supposed to have someone walking at all times, but when you think about it, walking around a track isn't that important, it won't save anyone from cancer, the $1800 our team donated, will.  Kelly kinda hung out in a chair because she couldn't sleep but me, Catie, and Kathryn slept in this huge sleeping bag outside the tent.  It was the only time I was warm all night.  I love being a girl.  Ok its 4:49 and I haven't even taken a shower because I've been sleeping all day.  I have to go babysit for my Spanish teacher at 6. I better get going with the shower thing.
