Free panties @ VS, make up counters in belk, and jana trying on huge heels in attempt to be taller than me [good times right THERE!] It was really fun, i hadnt seen laney in a while so that was good too! I got a few things + achieved my goal in getting jana to try stuff on thank [[thank you i love you!]] Then she got picked up and brad and caitlin drove up right as she was leaving.  We chilled in my room for a bit and then lee came over.  How many outfits did me and caitlin go through>? Then we went over to maggies so i could give her back her pants for her portraits today + we kidnapped her! *lol*  Drove over to A3s, played some video games [mortal kombat brings back SO many memories!] then headed over to Chili's for dinner.  Brad hadta leave : ( b4 we ordered but then Jen met up with us. Ate dinner then actually went to go play tennish, yes, i said play tennis.  A3 left and we went over to jen's neighborhood.  Changed clothes, and played for about an hour.  It was fun...def. a good laugh.  Then everyone needed to get home so me and lee dropped off caitlin around 1135 then drove me home.  We talked for awhile [that was more then ive let out in a long time] then i went in to bed! i was  exhausted . Plans for today...VOLLEYBALL..oh gawd.
