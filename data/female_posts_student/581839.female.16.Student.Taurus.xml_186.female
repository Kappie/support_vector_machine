I think she is way depressed because it seems like she is so lost and doesn't know where to go. i don't know how i can help, i mean, i try not to be mean to her, and i feel like i shouldn't judge her, but i feel like when we were friends she finally was the head honcho, so she took over and picked on everyone else because she finally felt powerful. i mean, she was finally important, but she said such mean things and demanded so much of me. i don't know, i feel bad about it.  anyway this afternoon my mom and i went to go see honey, and it turned out to be really good actually. i liked it a lot, especially jessica alba, she was so cute, and i didn't know she was such a good dancer! hm, you learn something new everyday. anyway, i still have a lot in my room to clean. better get to that julia
