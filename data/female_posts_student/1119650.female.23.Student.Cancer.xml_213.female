Strap on your harnesses and helmets and lets get ready to lick the windows together, shall we?  1) When you corner a man like the vile and otherwise skeevy rat that he is, he will fold like a cheap suit.  (Thats right, he confessed to cheating and I told him to fuck off permanently, go me!)  2) Although it seems like a good idea at the time consuming 12 drinks on a work night, dancing on the bar with your best friend (who is playing shot girl) and dancing til 1 am is not a good idea when you have to be up for work at 6:15am. (Ick!)  Similarly, being hungover at work is way underrated.  Its more painful than you could imagine...even if you are playing boss.  3) No matter how much time passes between outings, when you hang out with people who are truly your friends its like picking up right where you left off.  The scars of past battles fade with time and you can all smile together again.  4) To quote my mommy "A Leopard Can Not Change Its Spots", however its possible for a 150 lb girl to lose 200+lbs of dead weight (and look fabulous while doing it!)  5)  Sheepy cards can ALWAYS make you smile even on a very SAD day. (Thank you!)  That wraps it up for this innagural (and lame) first edition of the friday five, tune in next week fearless reader, same diva time, same diva channel.
