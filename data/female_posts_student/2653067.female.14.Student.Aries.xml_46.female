In the car sat Sam, Wade and Mr. Croft.  After a long car ride, we got dropped off on the side of a curb on a street near the London drugs in richmond.  We spent some time looking through the cd's and dvd's at the London drugs store and then we walked to the mall.   The trip to the mall was quite pleasent at first.  We looked through a couple of stores and went to the chinese bakery.  Then the worst happened.  Mr. Glass, who was sitting in a strange position on a near by bench, spotted us!  It was very unexpected and I was horrified.  Sam and I peaked around the wall of the bakery as Kelsey paid for some rolls.  Mr. Glass's eyes were focused on Sam and I.  Finally, after what seemed like forever, Kelsey finished paying and we walked out of Mr. Glass's sight.  After the awful moment, we browsed through a few stores, and walked over to the food court.  A small, chocolate,  Dairy Queen Milkshake was bought (and eaten) by Sam.  The last stop was HMV.  We spent a good forty five minutes there.  In the end, Sam bought a  Guided By Voices  Cd, Kelsey bought Two Dvd's and Cd's that were $101 in total and I bought  The Velvet Underground  Nico  (see the image above).   It turned out to be a great shopping trip.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough money to buy something that I wanted so I'll have to return to the mall soon.  Hopefully I won't encounter Glass ever again.
