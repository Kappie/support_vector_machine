No one showed up for practice, including the choreographers which makes it suck even worse. And then I FINALLY auditioned for One Acts today and it went very well, despite the fact that I had to wait there for like an hour. Mrs. Saeger and Laura decided they were going to schedule a rehearsal for today at 5:30, and not tell me about it until this morning. Grr, I was angry. Especially since I had a hair appointment scheduled for 6. I tried to find Laura after school at her play rehearsal, but she wasn't there, so I just decided not to go. Not my fault. They didn't even give me directions to her house, so whatever. Then I got my hair cut. Nothing drastic, my hair is still as boring as it was before. And the hairdresser was running late so I had to sit there for a half hour. Annoying! Yes, and I was going to take a mental health day tomorrow, but turns out I have an algebra quiz (yes, on exponents), an English test and a Spanish test. So much for that. Meh, I catch up on sleep this weekend, considering I'm doing absolutely NOTHING. I'm going to my Dad's so its not like I could do anything anyway. Whatever. Tomorrow's friday, WOO HOO!!!
