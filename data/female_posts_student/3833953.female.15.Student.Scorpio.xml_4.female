Ive been getting into arguments with my mom more often, and my mom and dad are arguing more often..of course..thats nothing new. in the past week, ive just been generally down about things. I usually try not to think about people dieing, but the past week has just been alot of it. ive heard about famouse people dieing and people i kind of know, and things like that. besides that ive really had a few things on my mind latly. id reather not discuss on them.   if nothting else, am atleast excited about going to the USAF musuem today. im leaving in about an hour. i was orriginaly going to go to the Dayton air show saturday, but my dad suddenly had to work. Today, i was going to aswell, but it didnt seem all the worth while when my brother didn't want to go today, because of his work tomorrow. he had wanted to go saturday so he wouldnt get tired today and then be dragging butt the next morning..after some discussion, it ended up that my dad, mom, and I are going the the USAF museum. im really quite excited as weird as it sounds..   well ill update later and stuff. need to go get ready.   cya yall later..  -"phoenix"
