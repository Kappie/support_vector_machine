I've decided to use this, the second verse of the Beatle's "Across the Universe". They're so amazing. I love them so much. Their music is the closest thing I can get to a religious experience. People who don't know can't understand how important they are to music and how much they mean to me. I grew up with them, knew all the songs by heart, from "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" to "Glass Onion"... since I could talk. It's not obsession, it's love. They're like family, the voices of John Lennon and Paul McCartney are as familiar a sound as the voices of my parents. The rock gods that will forever represent the greatest band of any genre and any generation. Why am I so deep today?  PS. I would debate the hook on this version on the lyrics... it sounds to me like he's saying Ty Karoo Dayvla... not Jai Guru Deva... at all.  Across The Universe (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) Lead Vocal: John Lennon  Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind Possessing and caressing me Jai Guru Deva OM  Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world  Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes They call me on and on across the universe Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe Jai Guru Deva OM  Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world  Sounds of laughter shades of live are ringing through my open ears Inciting and inviting me Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns It calls me on and on Across the universe Jai Guru Deva OM  Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world  Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva (fade out)
