Not his fault really, since apparently the Air Conditioner's Compressor is grounding out, or grinding out. If it's grounding out, that would mean the wires that supply the Compressor with power is contacting something else metal, and instead of the electricity getting to the compressor, it's going the quickest route to ground, which is the roof. If it is Grinding out, well then I would guess the compressor Pump's bearings blew out and the pump is grinding and not doing any good. Why the confusion as to which is which? because it seems that Technology Repair Specialists have the mandatory requirement to have the handwriting of Doctors. This is why I type instead of write most of the time, but for some reason, these guys never seem to have a computer capable of printing out an invoice. so instead I get this poorly written slip of paper that says "Compressor is (grounding?/Grinding?) out, Cond. needs Replaced."  The other problem with this is that they didn't give us an estimated time of completion of replacing this equipment. We called our landlord, who is going to call them to kick them in the rear, and we called the SOS ourselves, and their answer to us was they're not sure it'll we fixed all week! and with 85 Degrees all the rest of the week, it's gonna start baking me and my computers :( which sucks. I probably should have turned off my computer, but I didn't, will have to start doing that the rest of the week. hopefully all the fans in my system will keep the system chilled.   What also ticks me off is that I may not be able to play EQ this weekend, because we're taking refuge up in my Father in Law's house, which I assign the standard "nice place to visit" clause. As in, it's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there. They only have a PS2 for gaming, the computer is off limits for gaming and even anything short of basic internet access.   Now those who know me know that I cannot live without my computer, I want to at least be productive, but all I can forsee me doing at her dad's place is drooling on the couch watching the kid get in trouble. And frankly that Blows goats, I'd rather go to work than be nothing more than a slave to the child. I have needs to, and I guess they just won't be met this weekend, this weekend will be hell in a cell. might as well be in prison.   Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
