The one I'm most worried about is biology or creative writing. Biology, I think I did okay, but one of the writing questions I've never even heard of. Then the creative writing I had to write a story on one of 5 pictures on the board. The max was one and a half pages. not one full piece of paper, one side and half of the other. My story had to end really fast and doesn't sound good. Plus i left one of the short answer questions blank. OH well IT'S OVER NOW! This weekend I still have to get up though...earlier than normal. 5! That's the earliest EVER! lol I hate getting up early but money is awesome. Then I'll be able to pay for things.  ~Bayz
