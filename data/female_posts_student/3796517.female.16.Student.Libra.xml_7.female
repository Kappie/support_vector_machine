Everywhere else said they would give me $5.75 to $6.50. It was amazing. I can't wait, I start Monday. One day of freedom left, I still don't know how I'm going to spend it.  Across the street from Pathmark is the Minivan Man... I'M GETTING A JEEP WRANGLER!!!!    ")>   I can't wait...   82 days until I can drive!!!   The rest of my day... Went swimming and then went to Adventureland with Cassandra and her friend I forgot what his name is. It was fun. The rides were fun. I saw Eric and Steve, Dan got us in for free. Long day, I'm tired so I'll try to go to sleep. I doubt it will work thoguh.
