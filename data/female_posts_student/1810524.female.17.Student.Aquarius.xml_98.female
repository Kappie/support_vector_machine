You are that rare mix of sensitive and sensual, romantic and randy, pride and prejudice, etc. When you see your crush, you waffle like a Belgian, unsure of whether you'd rather paint their toes or suck on their toes. Poets have long been puzzled by your kind. You'll never fall for robots or nymphos, but you will suffer longs bouts of marriage.     urlLink        Your Passion is Purple!  You're passionate - but more people view you as funky.  You're more about sampling the different flavors of passion...  Not that you don't mind getting swept off your feet.  It's just you need a little someone new every once and a while.      and.....  You are a Romantic Realist  Okay, so you fall in the middle.  You know that love isn't like a greeting card…  Yet you can always find a greeting card to describe your feelings.    You are the best of both worlds  Girly yet independent, dreamy yet serious.  Almost any guy can find balance with you.      urlLink        You Are a Sensual Kiss!  Wet, soft, sweet, rough…   For you, kissing is all about how it feels  Whether you're kissing a longtime sweetie or a stranger  It's all about the sensual experience, nothing else!      urlLink        You Are Dreamy Sexy!  Your sex appeal stems from your constant dreamlike state.  Not only do you think about fairy tales, you have the ways of a fairy princess.  You're sweet, soft manner attracts similarly dreamy guys  And your natural girly beauty lures all men in, so be discriminating!    Vx
