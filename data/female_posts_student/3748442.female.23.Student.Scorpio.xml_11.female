This dream was a perfect example of the warm and fuzzy kinds of dreams that make me want to stay in bed just a little longer...  I'm sitting in a bar with a nameless, unidentifiable "friend" whom I suspect is actually Scarlet Johannson (the actress in Girl With a Pearl Earring), and as we're talking over our expensive cocktails about what a dork the bartender from New York is, the scene suddenly changes: in walks Kurt Cobain (never mind that he's been dead ten years) and a Courtney Love look-alike, who is actually his new wife (she looks like Love but sweeter and not-so-skanky). Immediately, Kurt approaches me with business offer: he wants me to join Nirvana.   First, Kurt explains, I will need a "new look," then I can learn to play the guitar. He informs me that the public doesn't care if I'm talented, they just want someone who  looks  like a rock star. I tell him that being in a band could be difficult because I have daughter. He tells me he has one too, but he never gets to see her. Her name is Frances Bean.   I tell him I'm not into Heroin. He tells me he isn't either, it was all just a big publicity stunt.   So as we are discussing the details--how this Love look-alike is going to be my mentor and Kurt will buy me anything my heart desires--we turn to the television that's on in the bar. The screen shows an island that's beginning to shake and wiggle, and then--poof!--it disappears. It was a natural disaster first: the very first time an entire island ever sunk to the bottom of the ocean.  I woke up just after Kurt and New Wife put their arms around me. I was disappointed as I lay there in my bed, knowing Kurt is really dead, I am really not a rock star, and oceans don't swallow islands whole.
