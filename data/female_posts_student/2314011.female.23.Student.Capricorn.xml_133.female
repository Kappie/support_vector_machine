He produces artwork at a stunningly high quality level that his professors (and soon the world's masses) never fail to salivate on each due date; he gives everyone around him more than they could ever expect without thinking twice while wondering if he's done enough; he watches over the residents in his care, keeps exhausting crazy-makers at bay without causing them pain or embarrassment, works until the wee hours of the morning, creates mixes that make the world cry and STILL has time to listen to me bitch about how rough I have it.  Love you, hon; I want to be like you when I grow up.
