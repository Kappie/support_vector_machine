Not because I can't admit I'm wrong, but becauseI often don't recognize my own insolence. Andby the time I do...it's generally too late.In saying that...I'd like to apologize. The following crimesperpetrated at one time or another...the victims....you know who you are.  I'm sorry for:   being reckless with your heart. I was young. Not that that is an excuse...but I truly didn't understand the impact of my actions. I had never had abroken heart...and truly didn't believe I was capable of producing one in someone else.  letting you get away with so much. I had an opportunity to gently teach you ways to treat other human beings. Instead...I walked. I took the easy way out...and you never knew.  dragging you down with me. Misery loves company right?  being so damn ungrateful. Sometimes I think I'm the bigget spoiled brat to ever walk the earth. Just so you know...deep down...I truly appreciate everything you have done for me...and probably will do for me in the future. I probably don't deserve it...but either way...I appreciate it. And I know I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for your continued support. You're my angels. Thank you.  making you believe you are worth less than you are. I have no right to pass judgements on anyone. Peoples differences are what make them unique...I am still learning to embrace that.  pushing you away. Sometimes it's hard to accept help.
