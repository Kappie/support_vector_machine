I had the most awesome nap in 5th period. we were watching an old movie...one that they're currently remaking..but i didnt take the time to watch most of it. I needed that nap. right now ive got a type o negative song stuck in my head..thats probably why i titled this blog "type o negative" ....go figure. So yeah..im gunna let a bunch of little meaningless words waste space on the internet. Dang. I have a 6 weeks test next period. US History. gotta love it. anywho. *yawn* ..I miss Jae. I wonder what hes up to. I cant wait to go see him in June. anyway..i think this is where i stop posting, and i check out all the neat little things i can do with this gadget..to see if i really want to keep it or not.   -Cheers-
