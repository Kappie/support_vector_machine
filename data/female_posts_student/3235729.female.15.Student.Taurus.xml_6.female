Then I stopped for a minute and just stared blankly at my paper. I wasn't amazed that it was the 20th of May, I was just so creeped out about how fast this month has gone by. This whole year, matter of fact. Last year was painfully long because life sucked last year and doesn't now, but that's a whole other story. Anyway, so I'm staring at this date, and out of nowhere it just clicked. 5 days. 5 fucking days! 5 days til the Distillers concert! I can't believe it. This is the same Distillers concert which I've been counting down to since it was 55 days away. It doesn't even feel like I've been waiting 50 days, but I definitely have. I just find that incredibly creepy, how time flies by so fast. Now, I'm not  trying  to make a referance to cliches or anything, because they're the devil, but that one "Time flies by when you're having fun." It sounds cheesy, but it's kinda true. I'm not going around to my friends, skipping merrily and saying "Gee, guys! The time is flying by so fast! Where's the year gone! We're having so much fun we just don't realize it!" But. It's kinda true. Minus the preppy factor. Matter of fact, don't even try to figure that one out. The bottom line is, cliches are cheesy, and time is jumping around at random intervals.  Soo, today is officially boring. I'm so tired. I've been tired all goddamn day. And I know why. I got up in time to catch the 8:10 bus this morning rather than take the 8:23 and be 10-15 minutes late. Normally, I can't be bothered to wake up in time to catch the 8:10. Whenever I try, I get ready, look at the clock and it's already 8:15. But. I got up in time to catch the 8:10 today, and I don't know why. I walked into English this morning and Mr. VanD gives me this creepy ass smile, shows the thumbs up and goes "Woohoo! You're on time today!" "...Or so it would seem."   Anywho, school (as always) was slack as hell. In 1st period we read a myth (wheeee...), in 2nd we got the remainder of our abuse presentation, in 3rd we watched a movie about Rome, in 4th we watched Stomp and I fell asleep in my chair, in 5th...I actually don't know what we did. I kinda fell asleep then Ms. Halbert woke me up and hauled me down to the office and I sat there. Doing nothing. If she does that again on Tuesday, I'm just going to go into the gym and visit whoever's up in the bleachers. And Halbert phoned my dad, and I phoned him from my cell after school and he tried to bitch at me, but I just told him that A) I don't get that fucking shit, B) It's retarded, C) I don't need that class next year, and D) I never do shit all in that class and I'm still passing (he was bitching about me failing or something). Like fuck. I wish he was out of town so I could skip that class altogether. But noo. He doesn't go back to Estevan til July 1st. Fuck. HATRID GRR! Anywho...  Today I had my eye test in Driver's. Surprisingly, I passed. We like had to read these numbers that were 18,000 miles away (I had  no  idea what they were, I guessed half of them). Then, he'd switch eyes and we had to read them again, then my mom and I went down to some office dealy that gives you your licence, where they took my picture and I got my learner's. Yeah pretty excited about that. I most likely will get to go driving tomorrow. Providing that the weather will be nice tomorrow, although I do love the rain. That's what prevented me from driving today. Stupid bastards. Stupid stupid!  ...It would appear that I have run out of topics to rant and/or ramble about. I  may  get some further ideas as to what to blog about later in the night, upon which I will rush to the computer just so you can read my senseless rambles. Actually, it's more like I'll go on the computer and blog if and when I feel like getting off my ass to do so. Although I doubt I will get more ideas. We'll see what happens.   -Joebie
