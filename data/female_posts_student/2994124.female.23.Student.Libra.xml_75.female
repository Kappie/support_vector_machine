So after seeing my GP, I popped into town for a few things, and then as I was walking past Starbucks thought, why not treat myself.  Now before you all shriek with horror that I frequented a Starbucks – we don’t have little locally run coffee shops over here, and so we have to go to the main ones – and I choose Starbucks because it does offer Fairtrade coffee and tea – if only as an alternative.  So I bagsied an arm chair and got myself a big mug of hot chocolate and a muffin and settled down to read my book. 2 hours later I realised what time it was!!!  It was just SO relaxing. The constant hum of other people, but not so loud or near that it disturbed me.  And I couldn’t believe it because none of the staff had come and asked me to move (which DOES happen in England).    So it’s been a pretty chilled day today. I feel like I got lots of things accomplished (oh except beginning the man-hunt – maybe will have to postpone that for a while) and I even introduced my flatmates to pears and peanut butter and they didn’t think it was that bad!!  So there’s hope yet!    Have just been busy writing letters to charities asking for donations for the Tanzania trip – no-one has posted any exciting or unusual fundraising ideas in the guestbook. If you are feeling slightly embarrassed or nervous about declaring publicly such things you can always email me!  Got my Survivor predictions in – just got to wait till tomorrow morning to find out the result – hey that could be a good incentive to get up in the morning.  Tomorrow is a WORK day – as in I MUST start writing my assignment. The time has come, I can’t put it off any longer, or read anymore articles – I have to actually write it!!  So goodnight folks.  Enjoy Surivivor!  mexxx
