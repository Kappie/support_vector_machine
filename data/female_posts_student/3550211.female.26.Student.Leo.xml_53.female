As Eugene Volokh said himself, because some people associate the term "Jews" in a negative manner. I.E., "It's the  Jews  fault." or "Those cheap  Jews !"   To which I have to answer, hahahaha. I think it's ridiculous. I call myself a "Jew" quite frequently. A cheap Jew, at that. Not to mention, a Jew who lives up to the fabulous (and hysterical) stereotype; my New York grandparents moved to Florida years ago!   LoL.
