Man my head was starting to pound there for a while and well GREAT news....originally it said on my scantron that I got 35% on the M.C. social test well me and the social teacher went over it and like half of the things I put were right now yeah I actually DID pass - thank God he just said it was because he thinks he ran my test through the wrong key so lots of things were wrong when they should have been right.  And well I had the math quiz today and well I am just not too sure how I did.  My mind is kind of like ya know sort of went blank but I mean I know how to do the stuff so I guess I will just have to wait until tommorow to see how I did but I probably did fine because I really prepared for it.  And well I feel pretty good today and yes still confused with chem and all but I am sort of getting it a little bit more and my chem teacher DOES seem like she is trying to help me because I think she can see that I am really making an effort to do good.  And like tonight I was majorly studying for social because after last test I got a 60% on M.C. and a 75% on the written answer but I know in my heart that I could do much better than that.  And well yeah I feel good, I feel happy - there were no fights today and well I talked to other people that I don't usually talk to so much.  And paige invited me to Calaway on the 11th so maybe I'll see if Alex is a ride person cause knowing Paige she wouldn't care who comes she would just think 'the more the better' so yeah that is an idea and I was thinking that maybe one weekend me and him could go during free skate and just hang out and well I can't wait til it snows so we can act like kids and go slidding down the hills and go skating at the rink like 5 minutes from my house and build a gigantic snow man and then when December rolls along we can go to the dance.  Man all the great and fun things I can think of.  I think a little part of my self esteem just took like a major boost.  It feels good, and I want to make it last.  Things have been going a bit better lately and I KNOW on Friday the Chem test will be challenging but in the end I think I have really got to realize that I CAN do things if I believe that sometimes we don't always do as well as we would like but it is not the end of the world and WE DO always get other chances, we have other quizzes, and other tests.  And that is right that one mark or one bad quiz doesn't mean I have to hate myself, or beat myself up over it.  It doesn't have to mean that at all, it can mean that I have made some mistakes along the way.  But mistakes are good, they are learning experiences and even though they may upset us at the time, when I look back on things I realize that the most important life lessons for me have come from the many mistakes I have made in my life time.  And thinking about this now reminds me of all the hard things I have gone through to get where I am now.  Like when I was a kid I don't think anyone even liked me because I wasn't the ideal "thin" like all the others kids and well in gr. 6 it got to the point as bad as when I was seriously considering suicide and I guess no one really does know what things in life have been like and I have been through alot that no one, not even my best friend will even know about.  And well I got through that but then two years ago I was older, wiser, but knew more about things and had a better idea of suicide but there was someone there for me and she always could tell something was wrong even though I thought I kept it hidden so well.  I have to admit man she had some sorta of gift.  Sometimes I don't think teachers realize the difference they can make for people.  Sometimes they can makes the difference of life vs. death and I would say that is a very powerful thing.  That is also one of the reasons why I want to be a teacher because of the difference that I could make too.  So I wrote this poem that has a lot of meaning to me:     All My Life  This is the story of all my life Can I tell you what is was like? It wasn’t easy and it was so hard Take a look at me and see how far I got  Being pushed around day by day Called those names that I dare never say Told I did not matter, it hurt me so bad I had that feeling inside, told me I was sad  Down so deep and feeling alone, all on my own Why wasn’t anyone out there to hold? I wanted happiness but all I had was one plan To take my life and that would be the end  Along came a hero, she walked in the door Held me tight until I hurt no more Told me everything would be just all right She gave me hope for a better life  Now in high school; I’m having the best time Who would of though I would of made it this far There’s a hero out there waiting to help you through And she knows exactly what we all go through  The good and the bad The happy, the sad The joy and the misery That is what all my life has been filled with  When I was all alone, she helped me through I felt unloved, but now I feel the love inside of you Seemed uncared for, and now I’m cared for even more And this is how all my life has been like  Through the halls I pass all the people I know Hear the laugher as I walk the school floors Now I know so much more, things do get better And sometimes all you have to do is wait for that hero  This is the story of all my life Can you feel the pain that I’ve felt all this time It was never easy and it was all so hard But take a look at me; I got so far  And this is the story of a young girl She never really wanted to take her own life All she wanted was to be loved and cared for And this the story of all my life  ~Vanessa
