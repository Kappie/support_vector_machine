The address is: http://notsoaverage56.blogspot.com/  But to make htis blog work I need a bunch of people to make posts. You can be on the posting team by posting in the comments section. You have to be a registerd member of blogger, but I think just about all of you are already so that wont be a problem! :)  Anyone can do it! All you have to do is post about random things. Like how cheese is tasty. You can also post poetry, stories, art, anything!!  :)  I am just seeing if this will work, I hope it does! :)
