But eventually..I will have to go back to school, and when the school year is over, I will be moving on to smaller and worser things.... ( I will be moving to a new city, and will be separated from all of my friends...) I really do not want to move. If I do I will be have to be apart from Kindra, my Kindra, my best friend, the sister of my soul! we know eachother inside and out, we confide our deepest darkest secrets in eachother. I dont know if there is even one thing she doesnt know about me, we even have plans for the future already. Whenever Im not at my house, I am at Kindras, Its the most sacred friendship one could have, how dare our parents separate us (she is also moving, so we will be even farther away from eachother). I have lived in this town my whole entire life, I wanted to grow up here, and graduate with all my friends. the ones I have gone to school with my for my whole primary years! I have written a poem for you Kindra (if you should come across this website some future day, but then I may have already given it to you) and I have been working on it for months, and its still not ready, just give me time and it will be perfect. I promise.      (I am such a freak, lol)
