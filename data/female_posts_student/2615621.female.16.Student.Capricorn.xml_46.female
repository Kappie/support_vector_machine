I really hate not seeing lauren in school and talking to her about how much we hate katie and catherine and how much we hate katie liking will and andrew and anything else with man organs and how we hate...a lot of stuff and then we crack up at ourselves and each other..if that made any sense. haha   Let's see..what all has happened intresting to me lately...well...things didnt work out with charlie, i'm a lil too shallow to go out with him, hes..umm..not my "type", so im back to block one, lonely and wanting a bf just so i can dress him and walk around showing a hot dude off...lol im so shallow i might as well drown in the kiddie pool haha. anyways, heres my newest seceret WHICH NO ONE KNOWS, but kaela, but she doesnt count...and of course unless ur in my drama 2nd period class, then i think u've caught on...but here it goes----  Over this past semester Catherine P. and i have become actually pretty decent friends, i mean, we've always been civil and nice to each other and said hey in the halls, but lately we talk a little more and are parterners on the soccer team and stuff like that. She tells me all her issues with her boyfriend Ben...and then again, Ben and i have become good friends this semester also...because hes in my 2nd period drama class, a class where i do nothing but sit, and sometimes lay on a couch with ben. *ouchies* well, Ben complains nonstop about how catherine never puts out for him (hahaha im laughin so hard now) and how he hates almost everything she says and does. In this class is also Chris, which is Falon's ex, and now is talking to Elizabeth M, and has been talkin to her for like EVER, and he flirts nonstop with Falon and its kinda funny, cuz they get the other couch. Chris tells me all about how Ben uses sunless tanner to get tan, and thats why his feet are white and his legs tan, and he tells me how catherine started giving ben head and stopped after a few short mins and ben got bad and went home without saying anything, and about how prom is coming up and again this year, both their dates have to be home when they got a cabin for after prom. Catherine cant go to the cabin without her mom being there and ben complains about how catherine always goes home to hang out with her mom and he hates it...im starting to think he hates everything about catherine. lol poor catherine. ANYWAYS, back to prom, ben, chris and i got into this convo about after prom things, like going to the cabin. Ben and i joked about how he could take catherine to prom but come and get me when he takes her home and i go to the cabin..haha it was a funny joke, but there was a twinkle in his eye. haha um..i was jk. anyways, that lead to a more in depth covno about what all me, ben, chris and falon could do at the cabin after prom, and that includes the comment made by ben "me and chris could train u two (pointing to me and falon)" train, as in.. a chugga chugga choo choo, as in ..we are all gonna be hooked together, as in..one tangled mess of bodies, one complicated orgy. *as i feel like a bad grandkid with my grandfather behind me working as i type all of this* it was funny though haha And then there was the time, well it was friday, we had to use to library as our drama room and ben and sat at a table and falon and chris sat with some other people. Falon threw me and ben 2 pieces of gum and ben took both grrr. he told me i had to earn my gum *rolls eyes* i had to play flick football with him. haha oh buddy. we played football for like 45mins and through out the game he tore off a piece of my gum and slid it across the table. When we were bored with that he started tryin to throw my script in the trash, pissed me off so i turned around and faced the other way and said i wasnt talking to him, he started to sing that "happy together" song or whatever and play with my hair, so i had to turn around and smile, i cant get pissed off at him, anyways, we went back to playin football and u have to like lean across the table to push the lil paper over the edge to get a touchdown, well..when u have ben looking down ur shirt...and then the time he flicked the football down my shirt...it gets more intresting. WELL, change of subject. LAURA GREENE. ugh. she goes up to falon and chris and says " ben and julia are gonna start to date cuz they flirt all the time and u and chris are gonna start to date cuz yall flirt all the time" GRR falon comes up to me and ben and tells us. I'm like...omg...what's ben gonna say or do? Ben looks at me and then looks at falon and just kinda laughs. im finally at ease..haha i was like omg what if he jumps up and goes UGH NO I HATE JULIA haha welll, we just laughed it off. He is dating catherine after all. lol anyways, heres more of the lil seceret, i like ben lol yes...i have grown to like ben. I liked it when laid his head on my arm and held my hand, i like it when he leans up against me and looks at me and i like it when we play the slap game (where u slap the other person forehead when they dont see it coming) and i like it when we joke about how we're gonna screw one day..haha and i really like it when hes pissed me off and he looks at me and puts his hand on my leg and starts to sing me these stupid old love songs. lol i even like it that he has a gf and shes a friend of mine HAHA ..naw it makes me feel bad that i flirt with her bf...lol i like ben..haha and yes, for wondering minds, i would go to the cabin with that boy after prom, ANYDAY haha but i would be good of course. :D   oh and one more thing, chris is hott too...even if ive had his gum in my mouth --might as well explain briefly...ok, he had this gum and wouldnt give me any and he kept handin me gum outta his mouth and i would never take it, then i said if u do it again ill take it, thinkin he didnt wanna lose his gum..well he took it outta his mouth and stuck it in my face..so i had to take it cuz he was like..u said u were gonna..so i did..i chewed his gum...lol hey hes hot, and i got gum...haha   so now u know who i like lauren and the scandalious things i do in drama 2....haha and now im gonna go take my inkblot test!
