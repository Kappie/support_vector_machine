I figured kevin would call me after he got off work yesterday, but he ended up not calling til like 1 am and then he was in a pissy mood and wanted to get off the phone right away. He said he'd call me early today becuase we both have to work, and I don't get off til 11:30. Well, he didn't call. I guess that shouldn't have suprised me as much as it did, but it kinda hurt. A lot. We're drifiting apart, and hes letting it happen. I still think its fixable, but we both have to put in a lot of effort. I think he doesn't want to. If he decided for sure that its over, I think hes not telling me so he wont hurt my feelings. Thats just dragging it out so it'll hurt a lot more later on. The biggest thing we have to work on is openness and telling eachother everything. I don't think he is at all, and I wish he would, even if its not what I want to hear. At least be honest with me. Tell me if you don't want to be around me or even talk to me. Just tell me what you want.      On a completely different topic, our power is out. Right now I'm at the library. This sucks becuase I can't dry my hair or straighten it. Oh well, it has to be up in a ponytale for work, and I dont really care how I look because no one important (kevin) will see me. **sigh** I wish he'd just talk to me about it, about anything really.
