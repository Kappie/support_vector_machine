It was just Apt 211, so not that big of a deal. ‘Jonah 33’ was playing and this sucky intro band called ‘Stricken’. It was actually really fun, all my friends ADORED Erik, they thought he was so sweet. Joel, Bobby, and Eric taught him how to head bang, Katie and Alex chatted with him in the coffee shop, and Tiff and Nichole just wouldn’t be quiet about how ‘Freaking cute!’ he was. He had a blast.   Tiff and I got al the costuming done for our new drama, oh and we just found out that the performance date got moved up three weeks. So now we only have two practices left before our first performance, and I will be in Minnesota during both of those. Oh, and I’m right in front and center. But hey, I’ll pull it off somehow.  We had tennis today, I’m getting better. I actually served better then Laura and Emily, so that was cool.  The weather is beautiful. Its like 75 degrees, insanity! It’s July! For cripes sake! Ah well, I shouldn’t complain, our windows are open and I don’t have to worry about sweating like an animal. I have hooked Sophia’s new cart thingy to the back of my bike and we’ve been crusin all over town. I give her a bunch of books and crackers, and shes good until I’m wiped. Fun.   Okay, I have to go, more later hopefully.
