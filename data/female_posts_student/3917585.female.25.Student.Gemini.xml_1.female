Although I'm more free to now than ever, with no fear of any siblings reading it! After 24 years of living with at least one of my brothers or sister, it's so nice to be a bit more independent! And now I've been living with Sean for almost a year!  Of course, I miss living with Steph. After all, we had never lived apart until this past year. I really miss always knowing what she's up to. I can't keep track of her very well anymore. And I think she's using her independence to spend way too much time with her slimy ex-boyfriend. Oh well. Not really much I can do about that. She has to see that he's slimy and that she can do much better for herself. All I can do is lead some good prospects her way... Which I'm working on...
