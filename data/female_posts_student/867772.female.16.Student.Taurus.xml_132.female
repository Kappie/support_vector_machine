But then it got crazy and unpredictable, and now I'm so used to it being that way. I've become desensitized to the unattainable. It's like gaining a tolerance for a drug: the drug of life.  Now, everyone and everything just seems to be. Not good or bad. It's like I can see everything, but I can't see the beauty in it all.   Beauty can be either good or bad; it's mysterious. Mystery has seemed to disappear from my life. Nothing feels larger than life anymore.  When you're sad and hurt by things, your emotions are pulled to an extreme. When you're happy and amazed by things, your emotions are pulled to the opposite extreme. Your emotions get exercise, and the good makes up for the bad, leaving you, at the least, releived.  Dealing with so many things and not being affected by them can be very overwhelming. When nothing brings out much emotion in you, it all builds up. It all builds up in the middle, and you have no way of expressing how things affect you.  I can describe tons of things. But I can't describe how this feels.  I don't like it, though.
