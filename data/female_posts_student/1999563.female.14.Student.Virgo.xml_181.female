Today I woke up and read my bible...then matt and I cleaned the house. (Noticeed I am capitilaized! Mwa haha...) Then I tooka shower and my myself look really gorgeous... Haha. riiggghhhtt.. Anyways.  Then I went to my sisters dress rehersal. HE was there. Lol Lol.  I will not mention any names, considering when Karsen reads this she will torcher me for life.  So I just sat and watched him act. (STORY TIME)  Then he walked of the stage and walked right up to me and goes "Hey! What are you reading?" Then he sits RIGHT next to me. I go "Great Expectations..the stupidest book in the world" then he says "Sounds...uh...stupid?" Hahahhaha. It was quite amusing. Then he just sat by me and watched the rest of the play. *sigh*  :P  THE END!  What a marvelous story!
