I hate people who talk and gossip which is basically all of WY but o well i'll live. Hmm i'm also dreading alot of things and looking forward to alot of things. It's just a messed up time for me right now. OMG justin got in a crash today! mrs. knaub was "daydreaming" and ran a stop sign and totaled his car. But o well she has to pay for it, nigga whaaat! Haha yay! Now he can get his ride pimped fo rill. But i was really worried about him when i found out. He's my nigg. But he didn't get hurt so YAY! The O.C. tonight was amazing as usual and so were the dunkaroos i ate. My friendz Shanny and trent came by so that was cool cause none of my other friends ever visit me. Aww hell i'm just not cool enough i dont really have any friends. I'm sad. Good night
