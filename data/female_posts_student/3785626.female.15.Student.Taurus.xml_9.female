Aunt Faye, Uncle Joe, and The Triplets. The triple torment. They love to get into everything, ask everything, remember everything, and just be annoying. I love them to death but they are just annoying. All in my business. Lol. My room is really for teenagers, I don't think its kids approved, cause I have like stuff that they shouldn't see until they understand. Teeheehee. Like I have this picture of this dude from a magazine, CosmoG!rl, that my friend gave me and he has his shirt off, and they were like why do you have that? I'm just thinking, ONE DAY you will start liking guys. I don't remember a day I didn't like guys. In kindergarten I had a major crush on um...somebody. I think it was because I watched soap operas...anyways then after they left I went to sleep. Woke back up for cake. Happy Birthday Mommy! Then called Tregory Holla Cherry...Aka Night Owl
