Are you able to do something as simple as having dinner together, and yet feel inspired by the effect that this person has on you?  With her, I stand firm to persist in staying as myself. As she never fail to remind me of what really matters in life.  I am fortunate to have met such a wonderful person to be my comrade in this voyage we call life. Stay walking with me, k?  Thanks. =)
