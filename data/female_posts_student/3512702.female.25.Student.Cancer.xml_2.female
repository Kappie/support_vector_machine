Its like you are making me take 10 steps backwards and I cant budge forward. Things I want to say, I feel if I do its like..Ok whatever..Heard this 1,000 times before. When you say you love me I melt yet shortly after I'm back in that mental slump again. If you are reading this..My tiredness you sense is not me being tired..Its that frustration that keeps me silent..That aching in my heart that says "what's changed with us?" I love you beyond anything explainable and it kills me when I feel these feelings. Because we have shared things beyond imaginable levels and I feel now as if we've taken so many steps back and are at the point where we are almost meeting again and yet you are someone different :(  I feel like you do not want my love expressed to you anymore..Like its nothing new. I find myself biting my tongue to tell you " I love you"  so I wait and wait and wait till it is said to me..And then I no longer hear it the way I used to.  The whisper in your tone would give me chills..Make me smile and I could feel the intensity of those simple yet big words. Please don't push away the intensity of our love..I know your life right now might not be where you want it to be..And things seem unknowing of where they will go..But I am here and I've gone nowhere, I am on your side and I wanna hear anything you say to me..
one thing that hurts me is when I express how I want to see you I get the impression that you wish I wasn't even speaking..Yes these feelings are indeed bad..I just wanna truly know everythings ok and that our love is intact and that we are to stay strong in what we have to face as a couple  and most of all that I am loved and wanted.. Why don't I feel so anymore?....
