[ok, i completely turned to weather and nature. so what :P]  i like plants.   i love that warmness in my heart that is caused by d.   i love that 'melting inside' feeling when d. writes something sweet.   i like confetti.   i like my self-made chocolate fudge [czekobobki hahaha] and my carmel fudge [werther's original] because it tastes good and i know that i can make as much as i want.     i hate that tension when i talk with my mother.  and i hate it when my parents  are downstairs.  and i hate it to lie to them again although i know that there's no other way to gain some freedom.  i hate myself sometimes.  i hate moskitos.  i hate my legs.  i hate the fact that i'm damn lazy.  i hate the thought that i'm wasting myself, my life.   i hate my lack of motivation.  i hate to deal with my brother and sister and am glad that both are not here now.     i prefer the night.  i prefer the past.  i prefer never to grow up.  i prefer white (black/white.)  i prefer dark eyes (dark/'light' eyes.)  i prefer liquid (solid/liquid/gassy)  i prefer chocolate.  i prefer english (german/polish/english/french.)  i prefer africa.  i prefer plants (animals/plants)  i prefer dad.  i prefer sister.  i prefer far away.  i prefer to hide.    wow. i was inspired i guess.
