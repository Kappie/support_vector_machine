This is now due to happen by the end of July 2004. Several residents have complained to me about the sign, fearing it blocked the view of buses coming along the road and was thus responsible for accidents on the road. Its taken a long time to get EDF to give us a date for the disconnection of power so that the sign can be re-sited. We have also submitted a bid to put a zebra crossing on Lea Bridge Road at that site to Transport for London - I'll let you know as soon as I hear about the outcome.
