That's good tho, that you in fact are 16 and have the quiz say 16. It shows, like...stability in your life or something. The fact that I got 6yo tells me: 1. I have some maturing to do, 2. I was looking for answers that I liked, not my real answers, which ties in to maturity, or, 3. I cheated. Since 2 is the most thought out answer, I think I'll go with that.  YES!
