And I am watching the show King of Queens and wondering, do they ever have sex? I think they are one of those modern couples that is "in love" for the convience of having each other...and then I wake up and realize it's a fucking show and I shouldn't be analyzing it.  So I shall watch King of the Hill instead. NO ANALYZING REQUIRED. How refreshing.  I got new glasses today. I usually wear contacts, but my new glasses are just so emo. I may just wear them as I cry to Dashboard Confessional into my Fruit Loops. Except I HATE Dashboard. AKA Chris Carabba. Anyone who names themselves a band name is an idiot. Like Connor Oberst. Get a fucking band and THEN name yourself Bright Eyes. I mean, he USED to have a band. But now he's on the cutting edge of the Emo scene. I only sort of like him because he is making Omaha famous. And I love my Omaha.  Tomorrow I shall late night swim in the lake behind my friend's cabin. And you want to know why? Because I fucking can. NO PARENTS. I feel freedom like any budding adolescent would when parents are absent. The first month of college will be like heaven on a budget. Until I start to miss my dog and then I will cry. Damn the dog and his big brown eyes. DAMN HIM!  Basically this is my just rambling about shit that doesn't matter to anyone besides me. You know what I need? I need older friends who can pull me out of the last rut of immaturity that I am in. Or just have older friends so I can say "Hey I have older friends and they are so much cooler". And then we can light stuff on fire and throw it at little children and bask in the lovliness of our immaturity that was never really lost - just buried until we turned 18 and left the house. Am I the only girl that constantly wants to light things on fire? Or steal street signs? Or do something stupid and juvenile just because it's not murdering someone--but it's still thrilling?  I think I need to go to church this sunday and talk to God. I doubt he would be happy with my lighting things on fire thoughts. Then again, when has he stopped me? The only thing stopping me is my lame friends. hahaha. I shall do something "bad" before I leave high school, dammit. I shall make some adult shake their head with disdain! I shall piss authority figures off and I WILL be PROUD! No more prudeness! Well, in the "doing bad things" sense. Not in the kissy-having-sex sense. Ya know. That's a little more difficult. Calls for personal reflection. And frankly that makes my head hurt.  So now that I have OFFICIALLY bored the shit out of myself, I am going to push "publish" and prepare for the caffeine and sugar crash that will most likely come with the next hour.  P.S. jeff is moving away. And now I am sad about him. I think after he moves is when I will egg his house. Just to be hostile...without causing suspicion. wee. blah.
