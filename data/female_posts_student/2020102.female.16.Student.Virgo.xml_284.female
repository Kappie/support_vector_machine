Yes, I know it was only the 70s, but having been spoiled by computer generated image masterpieces like The Matrix, it is a little hard to take movies like Logan's Run seriously anymore. The whole plot could have turned into an interesting movie if it hadn't been so cheesed up. It's basically about this society that is hundreds of years in the future and no one is allowed to live past the age of 30. Everyone has these little jewel things in their hand that tells them what age they are and when it starts blinking red, that means you have to go to "carousel" where you get "renewed." Only what really happens is you get "killed." But no one gets this, because everyone is dumb. Everyone goes to carousel and WATCHES the people get "renewed." It's like fireworks, only instead of firecrackers, it's people. There are these guys called Sandmen that go around and "terminate" the people who try to run away from carousel. Because apparently, having anyone who is older than 30 is a very bad thing. Logan is a sandman who runs because the computer told him to and he of course meets this girl named Jessica and they fall in love and get "married," only it's not really married because all they said was "Beloved husband. Beloved wife." They had just learned these words by looking at really old gravestones and they were like "so, that means they stayed together for their whole lives? I think I'd like that." They met this old man outside of their little protected, no one is old domed city that told them about what people are like when they actually live past thirty and don't get "renewed." If you for some reason thought that anyone had an annoying voice, rent this movie and compare it to the old man's and then decide who is more annoying, because I think it will be the old man.   Favorite quote from this weird movie: "Let's take our clothes off before they freeze on us!" -Logan  The best part of this movie was the cats. The only reason was because my cat started freaking out at all the meowing and sat and watched the movie with me for like five minutes before he got bored and left.
