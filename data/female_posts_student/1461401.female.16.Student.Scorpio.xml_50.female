That and the fact that he has been on twice today and said nothing, AND YET IT STILL BOTHERS ME!!! What the hell is wrong with me? It's like I need to have control over people. I need to feel like people like me, even when it's him. Grrr. I wish mark or steven were on. Another day in the life of a shitty hypocrit.
