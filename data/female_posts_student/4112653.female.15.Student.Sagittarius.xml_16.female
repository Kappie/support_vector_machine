"Come on Damien, we've already started, why not let us finish with her?" The leader of the boys yelled. Damien was about to reply when a sudden weight from behind brought him to his knees. "Run Tittanya! Don't let them catch you!" As he said this, he rolled over, pushing himself into the path of the other two boys. "Bastard!" Swore the one who had tackled him. "You're gonna pay for that!" The two others pulled daggers from within their jackets. "Slice him, we don't want him to inspire others to delay us, do we?" The leader gave Damien a nasty smile as a blade was drawn across his throat.  In his own time, Damien stood and moved off to find Tittanya and set things right.
