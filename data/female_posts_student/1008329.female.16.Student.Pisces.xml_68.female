Changes in hairstyle or dress may alarm parents but may be normal behaviors. On the other hand, changes that are extreme or sudden may signal drug use.   It may help to ask yourself the following questions:   Does my child seem withdrawn, depressed, or tired?  Has my child become hostile or uncooperative?  Have my child's relationships with other family members changed?  Has my child dropped his old friends?  Has my child lost interest in or drastically changed his appearance?  Has my child lost interest in hobbies, sports, or other favorite activities?  Have my child's eating or sleeping patterns changed?  Does my child suffer from headaches, nosebleeds, or other physical problems for no apparent reason?  Have I noticed the odor of chemicals or drugs around my child?  Do aerosol products at home seem to be used much too quickly?   Positive answers to such questions may indicate drug use. However, these signs may also apply to a child who is not using drugs but who may have other problems, such as depression or an eating disorder.   Be aware of common drug paraphernalia. Possession of items such as pipes, rolling papers, small medicine bottles, cans of whipped cream or other aerosol products, or syringes may signal that your child is using drugs.
