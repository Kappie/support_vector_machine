I woke up in the middle of the night though, and walked across the room to the phone because I realized I hadn't punched in the code for a wake-up call. Then I realized, haha, I don't need one!!!     Unfortunately, however, my plans of being stupid this weekend may be foiled. Its raining. So I guess I will hold my breath and wait for tomorrow. In the meantime, on of my good friends gave me some sound advice on the zoo here. In all honesty I have a weakness forzoos- and Missions games too- but that'll have to wait a bit. But, C. and I are getting seats for the season together next year, haha. I digress. Anyway, so after my friend recommended the Alpen Zoo, and to look at otters...minus discovery channel...I don't think I have seen an otter for real before? Do they have otters? Or am I going on the quest for the holy grail, Monty Python style?       The Pool Story . So, yesterday before her overnight train to Roma, C. and I decided we were going to kick back and chill a little; this week has puteveryone in such a tizzy that we needed some R Sooooo, we remembered hearing about this outdoor pool on the bus route, no we didn't ask "Which bus route?" because we are retarded. So, after hours of stalling we finally get on our swimsuitsand grab our little mats to lay out on and head for the door. We got downstairs to the bus stop and sat down realizing where do we get off?, where are we going?, and other stuff imperative to know. So we were sitting there looking stupid as the bus neared and I remembered the tanning salon two doors down the street. "What about the tanning salon?" hehehehe. Anyway we went to the tanning salon. We got back later on and everyone was asking, "Hey, how was the pool?" "Was it far?" C. was like, oh it was good, which only made me laugh, cuz we didn't everyone to know we went tanning in Austria. I think my incessant laughter was what gave it away. Finally we were like, uh, we didn't make it to the pool....we went to a tanning salon. Okay so maybe this story is still only funny to me, but thats okay I entertain myself.
