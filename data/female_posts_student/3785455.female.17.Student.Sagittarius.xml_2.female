Besides, this is awesome and it's a good cause.  So today has been pretty uneventful. I managed to make it to Adult Ed, unfortunately I didn't get to sign up for the course I wanted. I was hoping I could pop into a History, or Social Studies course; instead my sorry ass got stuck in a grade 11 Academic Science. I'm going to bend over and kiss my ass goodbye right now, because I'm only in the first lesson and my eyes are jumping out of my head. I'll take the Math course come August, it'll give me a full month for it, that way. Wow, that's one fucked up sentence.  I also popped into Job Connect earlier, thinking maybe someone there could send me in the right direction, instead I got this sermon about it being almost mid-july, and how did I intend to get a job now? Seriously, what the fuck. Ugh. I didn't expect that at all, and next time I go in there it'll be to show them my new name tag for a job I got  on my own ... thankyouverymuch.  The kitten has been sleeping for hours, she'll chew my ass later.
