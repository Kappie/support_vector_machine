There are two kinds of webs the ones that are really easy to break and the ones that are made of like super duper harder web stuff and aren't as easy to break. Well I got caught up in the hard one and when I looked up there was a giant brown spider like two inches from my face....That's whenI freaked out and started screaming and flailing my arms in the air like an imbicile. BUT no one came to my rescue they were just laughing, you punks. I could of died. But yea I was really scared that it would get on me and eat me from the inside....lolz, ok maybe not that but I was scared.   Yesterday I took my senior pictures...I realized why I don't like going to take pictures...The picture takers are always so non-friendly. But anywhos that took all of like ten minutes and I was kind of blind from the flashing lights but whatever. We got the hellz out of there. I saw Jennay in there all beauty-fied and thanks Kat for doing my hair.   Today I get to see my chicals...and get my tan on without caring about tan lines because of stupid pictures. Not like I need one considering I am already black.   yea...till later babes   P.S. I want to go to Six Flags, Raging Waters, and the beach...and anywhere else you'd like to take me ;)
