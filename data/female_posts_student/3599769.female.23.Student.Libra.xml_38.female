She's paying for nothing which isnt a bad thing, but i just really feel like I need to go home. i'm tired and I just want to watch tv, and not think. But if I just sit here my mind just wanders off, and then I want to start crying again. I'm ready for this to end. I think I might be able to convince myself that I'm gonna let him go. Or at least try and fake it. Hmmm, since I don't really have a choice I guess we'll see.   I used to always tell "Think positive" and positive things will happen. So I'm going to try real hard to be more positive from now on.
