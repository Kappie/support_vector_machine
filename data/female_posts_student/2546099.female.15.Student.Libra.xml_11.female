Wheneva i am on msn most of the convos begin with hey, how r u? But when ppl ask how u r they r not really wanting a truthful answer. I guess ppl expect u 2 say that ur gd even if u r fantastic or feeling like shit. Rather odd when u think about it. Well 2day is Mez's b'day. HAPPY BIRTHDAY MEZ!!!!   Today Rob (my manager) rang up and told me that all casuals hours have been cut, so i have like no hours. Im annoyed, but theres nothing i can do. Well it gives me more time 2 sit around and wonder wat life is really about. Its strange i sumtimes now dread going 2 work but when im there i enjoy it.Theres Jacinta (jac 4 short) even tho we r very different, ive taken a liking 2 her. She seems like she could b a gd friend and i guess gd friends r wat i need rite now. Then theres Kellie (my brothers ex) who i love 2 bits. She has such a kind heart, and i wish so much that my brother hadnt done wat he did 2 her, but i believe she is 2 gd 4 him neway. Theres also Philip, hes nice. Im not sure how i could describe him. He seems mysterious, but at the same time also like an open book, if thats possible. And of course there is Laura, shes lovely and always replies 2 my msgs! There is also Nathan, hes a tenison guy and a friend of Josh Wiles's but he is nice aswell. Sure he pays me out occassionally but its all joking around (I hope). And there r many others like Kacey, Sarah, Rebecca and Alarna. All very nice ppl.  Neways I need 2 write about sumthing more interesting but i cant think of nething. Hmmm... well the otha day, i think it was wednesday Fiona came ova and gave me my b'day pressie and chrissy pressie, both were late but thats ok. The chrissy pressie was a perfume with a matching deodorant which smells really nice. But the birthday pressie was the best. It was a blank calendar that she had decorated herself. In it were pictures form early last year and mainly late the year b4. Wheneva i flip through the pages of it i feel like crying, bcoz there r so many fantastic memories. All the photos were taken b4 evrything changed, b4 petra turned bitch towards me and b4 fiona and lewis went 2 boarding skool. I neva knew looking bak on the happy moments would make me want 2 cry.  I wonder if neway actually reads my mumbo jumbo, i hope sum1 does so then mayb 1 day when i write sumthing intelligent, sum1 will read  think wow that is so true. Neway off i go again until another blog. Buh bye readers.
