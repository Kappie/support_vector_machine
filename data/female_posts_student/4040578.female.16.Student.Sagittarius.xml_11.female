The little black kitten I mentioned in the previous post is no longer with us. We had found the kitten Thursday and discussed taking it to a vet to get treated and then try to have it adopted. But I knew that once the kitten got better I would want to keep it. So yesterday, I talked to my mom about it more and she agreed we could keep the cat, but we also realized we needed to get medical attention for it. Yesterday the kitten was starting to get playful. Even with only the use of three legs it jumped on and off my bed. I was so surprised. The kitten even try to race me to the door so it could go out into the living room with me. I fell in love with kitten. I was still undecided on a name for it though. But when I woke up this morning things had taken a turn for the worst. My mom woke me up saying I needed to meet her in the backyard and that we needed to discuss some things about the kitten. Once I made my way out into the backyard I just lost all happiness I have had for the past several days. Mom began to tell me that the kitten was using the restroom all over itself, it wasn't using the litter box, it didn't eat its food last night, it was breathing very hard, and that she would sit him down and he would just roll over and lie there. The kitten was sufferring. My mom then goes and calls like every vet there was in the phone book and every animal shelter besides the Humane Society. She didn't want to call the Humane Society cause there was more of a chance that they would put it to sleep instead of actually helping it. So I give the kitty one last kiss while my mom drives off to take it to this one vet to see what they said. The vetrinarian there said the cat had been attacked by another animal and that it was dehydrated. They said even if they did give the cat fluids there was a good chance it wouldn't live. After hearing that, my mom had no choice but to take it to the Humane Society. While being there, my mom asked for them to take the kitten. She knew it was going to be put to sleep. The people there asked for her to pay a $20 charge for allowing that. My mom said that isn't right and that the building was there for them to rescue animals and not to make it an issue of money. She then says I am not driving to Animal Control with this poor kitty. The manager comes out and says they will go ahead and take the kitten. My mom hands the kitten over to them while the kitty gives her one last meow. Like I said before, I didn't even give the kitten a name, but I grew close to the kitty. I thought that kitten was so lucky that it found us. Cause we being the animal lovers we are were glad to let the kitten feel safe with us. But now, I feel awful. I feel so hurt I couldn't have done more. All those "what if's" come to mind now. I just can't believe all the happiness I had, and all the happiness I had to look forward to with this kitten was just gone in a matter of seconds.      Moving on, if you can't tell this day just really was icky. Yesterday though was fun. I did end up going to the Fair last night. Leah, Josh (Leah's bf), William, and I all went at 9pm to 1am. From that time it was the all you can ride wristbands for $16. But me being a chicken that I am didn't get one. So yeah, I stood around checking stuff out while they all rode stuff. People problem think, "You went to the Fair and didn't ride stuff? You are weird and are missing out." But sure, go ahead and think that. I had fun anyway. Rides never excite me. So I made myself happy doing other stuff and just spending time with people. I did love petting the cows and donkeys though. Hehehe. O wait, I did ride the Ferris Wheel. Ugh, I was terrified just on that. I am so not cut out for that kind of stuff. But yeah, then around 1:30 in the morning I finally made it back home. My mom and Leah went to Steak 'n Shake when they were on there way to take Josh home. William stayed at my house for a few more hours and just chilled. He finally left and I went to bed. I just wish I went into like a coma or something. Cause I definitely didn't want to wake up to a day like today. But yeah, that is just all that has happen since my last post.      Ok, my head hurts from all my crying today. So I think I will go lie down or find something to do which doesn't allow my mind to go back to thinkin about the kitten. Well, unitl next time, I am outtie!       Music Playin' in The Background: These Days-Rascal Flatts
