Your Angel isn’t  I fell long ago  My music turned to ash  My wings to razors painted crimson  with my love  my pain  my obsession  I’ll tear you up  drink your tears  your blood  your obsession  ~  Mine  ~  Come with me, love  Give in to me  You’re drawn to me  Held to me  Can’t let go  Try, my love  my barbed wire will cut you  deeper  Deeper  Deeper  your life to my lips  my saving grace  my ugly beauty  my addiction  ~  Mine  ~  I’ll draw you out  Make you mine  Forever  Eternity isn’t that long, love  Your Angel is here with you  Hold my hand  I’ll keep you safe  Bound to me  Your sanctuary and refuge  I’ll give you luxurious pain  Take yours away  Give yourself to me, love  Give yourself to me.     ~fin~
