I love funny commercials such as these: [Vim Clean commercial]: Its where the mother is in the tub and shes cleaning and it looks like shes in jail but shes really stuck in the tub cleaning it and shes talking to her daughter and stuff. That is funny. [DQ Commercial]: This lady is trying these new MOOOOOlattes and the people who are judging are asking her to give it back, and then she starts running in the little room, and she runs in the window. Its funny. Today, I went to sunridge mall today, and I had to wait half an hour for a blueberry turnover from Arby's. I absolutely loooveee blueberry turnovers!! They are thee bomb! Yep.
