Chris was working tonight *smile* I'm glad I got to see someone I knew since I've been in the house all day cleaning :-D right now I'm going to go downstairs and watch "Matchstick Men" with dad, since we're the only ones home, moms gone out with a friend (hmp but she wont let me go anywhere) aaaaanyways, I'm trying to think of something inspirational to say but I can't think of anything...hmm maybe later tonight i'll post something constructive, hehe  talk to you kids later
