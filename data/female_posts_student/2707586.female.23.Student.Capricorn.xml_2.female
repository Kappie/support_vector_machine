Not the good ones from Jake's that taste incredibly delightful at 1am after a long night of fun, but the kind that are afraid of going outside when its below freezing. Now I realize that not everyone grew up in the artic tundra that I did, but you would think that the weather patterns have not changed dramatically in the last 20 years so those people who did grow up with snow would not be so shocked to see the temperature below zero. I am in utter shock at the amount of people who say "its too cold to go outside." I am also shocked at the amount of people from very warm places willing to go out in this cold just to have a good time. I do believe that most of the people sledding with us last night had had few encounters with snow in their lives which made it much more fun. The most fun was had by Ricky who is from the Philippines. He was a wild man on a sled and he almost made it into the street a few times. Tuyvon from Australia also really enjoyed her first time frolicking in the snow. All in all it was a good time although I was disappointed I never did see the people sledding on the couch. Maybe next time!  In a side note: Tiff I am so sorry for your loss. Its always hard to loose such a good friend and I hope that after a time of mourning, you will be able to move on. It is always difficult but I have faith that you will endure.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');
