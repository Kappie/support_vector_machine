Creativity is something that I actually feel is quite rare in Hollywood these days, so many studios just churn out these predictable pieces of garbage that lack imagination and originality. There are people out there who are unmistakably creative, Tarantino is a prime example of someone who's creativity that knows no limits, but that really goes without saying so I will not include him in this discussion.  I think I will start in the realm of television. A great example of creativity can be found in the F/X show  Nip/Tuck . A show that really only has four characters. F/X has done a great job in the last two years creating two great primetime dramas,  Nip/Tuck  being one and  The Shield  being the other(I will talk about  The Shield  in a later post).  Nip/Tuck 's story revolves around two completely opposite men who only have one thing in common, they're both doctors. Sean McNamara plays the seemingly perfect plastic surgeon that throughout the show finds himself battling his morals which eventually leads to him deciding to change his life, which alienates his wife, son and business partner. His business partner Christian Troy is a playboy in every sense of the word. His confident swagger attracts women by the dozen, and Christian enjoys every single one of them. The two characters are intriguing for so many reasons. Christian never has a problem with morals(they barely even exist anymore) and Sean finds himself constantly questioning if what he is doing is right. The character development on this show is incredible, creating so many different relationships between so few characters. It takes a lot of creativity to pull that off, that's why I think  Nip/Tuck  is one of the top three most creative shows on TV.  As for lacking creativity, I would have to say reality TV in general has lost all of it's originality and imagination that once captified America(I think the first  Survivor  I feel was a masterpiece of originality). You flick through the channels and you can't help but find an over abundance of reality TV. American Idol, Average Joe, The Apprentice, and the list goes on, and on, and on. It takes absolutely no imagination to throw a reality TV show into a prime time slot and watch the ratings fly. People are so bored with there own lives they want to live through these people that I would beat the crap out of if I ever saw them in person. Now I realize that I watched  Survivor: All-Stars , but that was in part because a few of those people I thought were generally kind of interesting(Boston Rob, Rupert, and Ethan). All in all though, all the major TV stations have gone way overboard with the amount of reality TV shows they decide to put on the air. Hopefully all the junkies will soon find something else to watch.  Hope I threw you a curveball or two, and I look forward to seeing what you have to say on the topic.
