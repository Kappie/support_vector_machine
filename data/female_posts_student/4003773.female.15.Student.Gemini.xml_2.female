I got here a little bit ago and we ate dinner.  We had pork chops and rice and asparagus.  Then we had strawberries for dessert.  It was really good.  So now Sofia and I are having a "race" to see who writes the most in a certain amount of time.  We're planning to go for about twenty minutes.  It's not really a competitive race though.  Sofia was just wondering how long it took me to write my last post, because it was so long.  I wasn't sure so I said maybe a half hour and she said it would take her like an hour to write that much.  So this is how were checking to see how accurate I was.  So now I have to think of things to write about for the next twenty minutes... greeeat.  Actually, that's not that hard for me.  I always write a lot or "too much" as some people would say (Lauren-another one of my friends, for example).  On essays or any writing activities in school I also write way more than everybody else and I am usually one of the last people to finish.  I honestly don't mind though.  I think I enjoy writing.  I can go on and on like some people can do talking, even if what I am saying is pretty pointless as it is right now.  My whole blog feels like its going to be really pointless right now, because I don't have anything interesting to write about.  I went to the main page of this site and looked at other people's blogs and they are really interesting... way more interesting than me.  I guess I could try to write about interesting stuff, but I don't think it would work to well.  One thing I am really interested in is politics and I know that interests a lot of people.  So politics... I could go on forever...  So, I live in the US, which means I'm spoiled, uneducated, conservative, and I hate France and think Iraq and pretty much the rest of the world needs our help and our sympathy, right?  Well, no actually.  I'm not the "typical American" if that is the typical American (which I hope it's not, because that would be really sad).  I am a liberal democrat, I hate Bush, I try to keep myself educated about what's going on in the world (but a lot of the time it's just so sad I need to take a break from it), and I don't really think I'm spoiled, though that depends on how you look at it.  I guess all Americans our spoiled to some degree because we take for granted all of the freedom we have and how wealthy our country is compared to other countries,-----(that was twenty minutes) but I think because I am aware and educated about these things I'm not as spoiled as many Americans are.  I also think France seems like a really cool country and I want to go there, though I never have.  I am really into the Tour de France right now and yes I am American in the way that I support Lance Armstrong- six tours... wow, but I won't get into that right now.  I have always been against the war in Iraq and I think Bush is an idiot.  I really want to see Fahrenheit 9/11, but I haven't yet (Sofia, who I was going to go with want without me while I was at volleyball camp... grrr... lol).  Well I'm going to have to go, because I told Sofia I could finish this up in five more minutes and that time is almost up.  I'll have to write more later about this stuff though, because like I said I love writing and politics and I could write about it forever.  I guess I really have my mom to thank for getting me so interested in politics... she is extremely active and involved in like a bizzilion organizations and at the same time she's going to law school.  I gotta go... my time's up.  Bye!
