I can't wait, even though this is a super easy semester it'll be nice to get out and have a nice relaxing summer. Re-wind...It'll be nice to get out and work all summer...that is, if I get a job, which I really hope I do soon! Well, no more camp this year...good thing or a bad thing? I don't know, I think I'll miss it quite a lot! Kelowna is just as much fun though! :p And Whistler...the most funnest trip ever. YAY CANADA DAY! Anyways...not much else to write today but I'll write in here later of course. Girls, you should all get these so we can blag away. Haha...that sounds funny. Toodles! xox
