This week I finally got to send a couple birthday cards *cougholiviaandfrancescough* and I wrote a couple e-mails. Okay, so we implemented our new 'cooking schedule' and it's going all right. I cooked chicken parmesan (heck yeah!) and it was taste-a-licious. I don't really know what that means, but it was good. Okay, so I don't remember what happened at the beginning of the week (days seem to run together... it would help if I knew what day it was myself) except we finally found a wallpaper guy and a carpet guy to get it OUT. (thank goodness!) OH, I remembered. Wendnesday... or Tuesday... either one. One of those days, I went to audition at Leesville for chorus and I am proud to proclaim I am NOT in the crappy choir!!! *applause and cheers from all Karen's fans* Okay, okay, settle down people. It's not the BEST choir, but it's the second best. That's pretty cool, and the choir teacher is really really cool and nice. (I think it's going to be a little better than some other high school choirs I've been in...). So way cool. Then yesterday I stopped by Leesville AGAIN to get my off campus pass (yea-yah!) and I didn't really get the chance to meet people or anything, but I did get my schedule fixed. That was cool. I'm really excited to go off (not that I haven't already... lol Emma), I just hope I can find someone to go off with... :)  Today, we had 'new student orientation' and the whole group of us was addressed as 'hey freshman class of 2008!'... it was great... *eyeroll*. Anyway, we just got the whole 'welcome to the school and here's the huge boring list of rules and organizations you're never going to join' thing. Then we found our classes. The school is freakin' huge! I got lost like 5 times. Not good.. oh well. My mom signed me up for the lunch plan... embarassing. Oh well. Then we got supply lists and crap. I'm taking a couple soph classes (like h. civics and eng. 3 that I have to take again) but oh well, I'm sure it will be fine. And we talked to the main counselor lady and I have to take WORLD history! CrAp!!! I hate history... *sigh* But coolio-yo, I met another Junior girl... she was a student council helper... the senior girl with her asked if I was a freshman... :( but I guess it WAS freshman orientation... okay okay. But cool things, I stopped by the drama club booth and the people are super cool. They have a moose mascot (not a bear with ribbons and stuff :) and this year they're doing The Wizard of Oz and another play that I forgot. I talked to them for a while and they're all really cool! And they go to NYC every year and see a broadway play and next year they're talking about going to the International Thespian Festival! I'm way excited. So that's what's up, and I gotta run yall, but I love ya and miss ya and wish you were here... or I was there.. or whatever. Muchas smoochas!*
