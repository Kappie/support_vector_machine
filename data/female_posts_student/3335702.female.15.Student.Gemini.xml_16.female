He's phone palz with Mark from Blink-182, Friends with a dude in Simple Plan, His cousin is the frontman in Metallica, and he talks to Bam Margera on MSN. But fuck, what the fuck! I like Adam..Wes..and now this dude? What is going on, I don't even know who to care about anymore.  Fuckety Fucking Fucks . Someone just have sex with me and allow me to be a sexual sacrifice, I need a drink or something, I need to feel the burn of vodka. I'm tired of being held down  held back. I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want. Fuck, I don't even wanna care about shit anymore. I just wanna be in fucking love and live my life my way. Fuck you and your stupid blue eyes, Fuck you and your skater hair, Fuck you and your deep sincerity, Fuck!! I bet their lies! Kurt Cobain if you can hear me...MAKE ME GREAT. Bed. Later. Worrrrd.
