On my coffee table I have a red pen and a stack of paper upon which I write reasons that I am quitting.  I have tea tree toothpicks ready to go.  I have a fishbowl filled with 2 days worth of cigarette butts. It smells horrible, but it looks almost artsy, which is not the effect I intended it to have.   I am already dieting in anticipation of gaining weight.  Right now I am smoking my brains out because I still can.
