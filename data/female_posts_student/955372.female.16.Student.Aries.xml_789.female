WOMEN'S FUCKING CHORUS- the devil 3. algebra 2- radzius 4. pe- titus/study hall- dillon/hamill 5. amer. exper.- ludwig 6. bio- letcavage 7. spanish- berkowitz b lunch  this will all change. I don't care many people I have to suck up to/cry in front of/kick ass I will NOT take chorus. I hate singing, performing, being organized, and this years freshman class (of which my class will be almost entirely made up of). Tomorrow I will go to the school at five am wait for them to unlocked the doors and then force them to change chorus to... ANYTHING ELSE.
