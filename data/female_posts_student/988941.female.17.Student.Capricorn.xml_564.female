Other than that, raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah and now I am extremely tired even htough I've had about 24 hours sleep since I got home at 7am yesterday morning. Raaaaaaaaaah. Anywho, just bought some vegetable curry from Somerfield so must go cook and munch before I start on packing (yes packing raaah cos I'm going away again on Friday raaaaaah). Raaaaaaaah. Ask Tom about week, he knows more than I do generally raaaaah.
