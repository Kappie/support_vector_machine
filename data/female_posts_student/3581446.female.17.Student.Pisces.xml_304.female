First I would change the state song, Perhaps to something not so long. Some Goa trance would be nice, Blow our minds once or trice.  Then I’d make a brand new flag, Upon which there’d be Englishmen in drag, And our national animal would change without fuss, To a dandy platypus.  My inaguration would be a rave, No-one shall be a black-tie slave, And we’ll all dance into the night, Letting the sun point our respite.  Our national language, rather pronto, Would become Klingon or Esperanto. And our capital, o’er more, Would be in tiny Singapore.  To solve the problems of commuters, I’d make everyone to ride on scooters. And then we would have so much gas, The crisis would completely pass.  And to fix our troubled healthcare, I’d make sure to send Chopra in there, And with ageless bodies and timeless minds, We’d all have the healthiest hinds.  And to better education, I’d encourage facsination. With curiousity as schoolmaster, We all know they’ll learn much faster.  As for the army, what I’d do, Is arm them with some feathers and glue, And when our enemies are stuck to earth, We’ll tickle them ‘till they repent to mirth.  So if these ideas make sense to you, If they seem indoubtedly true, And if you’d like me to be head of state, Please vote in election twenty-oh-eight!
