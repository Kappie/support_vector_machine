You all know how much i suck at knowing celebrities' names and what they did so i mistook her for...Amanda Bynes (is that her name?).  I thought that hilary Duff had starred in All That.  Turns out, it was Amanda Bynes that starred instead.  "Hilary"  blocked me after that.  Her screen name was an endorsement!  I still doubt that that was her.  Until i found out her email on a website.  It was the exact email i used to talk to her.  Anyways,  her name was Juicy, referring to the line of clothing.  What's so great about Juicy anything?  Hell, people just produce plain shirt with the word JUICY slapped on the front in big silver lettering and sell it for 200 bucks apiece.   Nikki: Oh, I loved your show called All That Juicy:  I didn't star in All That
