And I'm also going to try to get some better muscle definition. Maybe then I'll be ok for awhile.  Sometimes I think I place too much emphasis on my physical appearance. I really shouldn't tho because it just makes me not satisified with what I have. I always want to be better. It sucks. Anyways...enough about the boring mumbo-jumbo.  Today wasn't too eventful. Nothing exciting really happened. Oh well. I'm just glad that tomorrow will be Friday. I always look forward to the weekends. Oh, that reminds me. I have to send Chubbs a reminder about her appointment tomorrow. That is what a good secretary does. Hey, what can I say? I take all jobs given to me in a serious manner, and I do them to the best of my ability. Good quality, huh? Hmm...I haven't talked to Omondo for awhile now. Actually, lately I haven't talked to Chubbs too much either. Oh well. The show must go on. That reminds me today during computer class I was online reading something, and I read that there is a Jerry Springer Opera, and that it's going to appear on Broadway! Isn't that just insane? I found it to be quite bizarre. Crazy!
