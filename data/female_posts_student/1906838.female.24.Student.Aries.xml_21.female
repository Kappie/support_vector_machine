NOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo..... we have to come back at 2pm if we are free. I have free study until 4pm cos im supposed to see the specialist nurse then and even she hasnt confirmed with me whether or not i get to shadow her this evening. sapa sik gerammmm???   i mean if i had all the free time in the world i wouldnt want to be kept waiting around, and my exams are in a few weeks time! would i want to be kept waiting????   ok.. calm down belinda.. calm down. THIS IS LIFE. and i havent even started working yet.
