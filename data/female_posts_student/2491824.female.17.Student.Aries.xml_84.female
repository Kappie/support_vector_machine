I was going to try and describe it, but it's too hard. So, I'll just tell you the ending (and scaryish part) as: I was in an old house which I had never been in before yet was familar with (I have been dreaming about this house for a while now) which was haunted, I was there with three men in their fourties or fifties (who in the dream I had first met earlier in the day, although I never actually dreamed about meeting them) and a woman, who was about the same age and was a combination of my stepmom and a random friend of the family and a little bit of my mom--earlier in the dream, she was my stepmom. I apparently was spending the night there at that house, so the lady asked if what room I wanted to stay in because it was a very large house. I chose the room closest to the top of the stairs, which oddly was also across the hall from the overly-fluorescent kitchen. I chose this room because it was unique because it had no windows to the outside but had window; the windows overlooked the room (the living room?, parlor?) below. I was in that room being to get ready to go to bed when I heard a very unnerving sound (I can't remember for sure, but I think it was combination weird of a thump, and gasp, a woman's eerie moan). I ran out of the room to find one of the men in the kitchen leaning nonchalantly against the doorframe suggestly that he was quite used to the sound. Another of the men was walking casually toward the man in the kitchen and was about the start talking to him. The third man and the lady came quickly either from another room or from deeper in the darkened hallway, both seeming startled and concerned. I asked the woman, "Was that her?" and she nodded. I asked, "Is that room [the room I was staying in] the worse?". Again she nodded, and she asked if I wanted I stay in another room; I nodded. She and the man who she entered the area with began walking towards the stairs and she said to me something to the effect of, "Let's go take care of this"... or something like that... I followed the two of them down the stairs where. At the base of stairs we paused as we looked around for the source of the sound; we all knew it was from a ghost or something of that sort. We saw a faint vertical area of fog which was coming towards us. As a group, we moved out of its way, but then it started coming towards me. The man said, "Oop, well, I guess it didn't want to go that way," as I circled around him to stand on his other side. The specter still followed me, so the man grabbed me and tightly hugged me said, "Make it think we're one mass." The ghost seemed to be somewhat angered by this; it rose riser in the air, forcing the man to look up at it. It seemed to want to attack him, and unconsciously, he and I both stopped hugging each other, and I stepped back some. He began forcefully shouting the numbers 12 and 23 at it. ("12! 23! 12! 23! 23! 12! 12! 23! 12!") This had little effect on the ghost. A "sprout" branched off of the main foggy area to something out of my field of vision. The ghostly image began glowing a feirce greenish color which then surrounded the man. He seemed shocked and in pain, and he pointly with a look of intense horror in the direction that the sprout was going off in and shouted, "The demon is in the china!" ...At that point I knew it was a dream and knew I had to wake up although I did not want to do so. I knew it was bright and sunny outside, as I had woken up a several hours before that just long enough to look at the clock. ..So I did open my eyes.. My heart was beating pretty fast, and I was comforted to know that my lovely kitty was laying fast asleep by my feet. ..Still, I closed my eyes and sleep again...... That didn't work... ...So I got up and brushed my teeth...  I love dreaming..    That was waay longer than I wanted it to be... Eh.. Oh well!
