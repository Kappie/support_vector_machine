       
      A year ago at this moment, I was making my way through Gatwick Airport at the end of an 11 hour journey, watching the day begin for Britain.  Since nothing much is going on this year, other than the accumulating snow level and few escapes to movies, I thought I'd reminisce blog-style.     Thursday, January 2-Friday, January 3    The eleven hours of traveling didn't seem like such a big deal until hour 7.  Sleep was never an option, even if I hadn't been seated in the middle of the middle section of the 737.     And just what the hell is a landing card, anyway?  Will they let me off the plane without one?  That would be the perfect thing, really, especially after the passport fiasco.  Where did I put that damn thing again?  Now just calm down.  They're not going to send you back to the USA if you don't have your stupid landing card.   	  Somehow, time managed to pass and the flight attendants distributed "breakfast" around "5 a.m.," even though, to me, it was more like a midnight snack.  One hour to go; the butterflies were back and I couldn't sit still.  ~~~  Four days before he was to leave the country, Levi met his first love–Grant.  The last conversation Levi and I had while on the same continent detailed those four days and I couldn’t have been happier for him.	  Before he left, the seed had been planted in my mind for a visit, perhaps over Christmas break.  Not only would it be a great opportunity for me to see my first European country, but mostly, it would be a chance to visit my guy during his year away.  We often went months without seeing each other, and there were those couple of years in high school when we didn't speak at all, but now, a year was forever.  It wasn't as though we never communicated while he was in London; we were in better contact then than at any other time during our entire friendship.  Grant and I were the only people in the States he sent daily emails to, and I woke up early each morning during the fall and winter of 2002 to read and respond.    ~~~	  I knew they wouldn't be there when I arrived.  The Tube didn't open until 7, and they said something about having to take a train to get to the airport.  The time they'd built in to their schedule for me to secure my luggage, endure customs and such, evaporated as I found my suitcase immediately and breezed through the "Nothing to Declare" door.    Still, I scanned the anxious faces waiting at the end of the entryway, unable to actually make any of them out through the haze of excitement and exhaustion, hoping to hear a familiar gasp and shriek of "Honey!!"  When none came, I made my way to the change booth to get my hands on some British pounds.    	 Score.  Now when they get here, we can just go.  He'll be so impressed.   And so, armed with my new money and the sound of British conversations wafting through my mind, I waited.    I caught sight of Grant's short, blond, curly hair first.  I recognized him from the pictures; he dwarfed Levi's 6'4" frame by a good five inches.  I grinned and my palms sweated.     Holy god, he's tall.  Now where's my Levi?   He'd let his hair grow a bit shaggy.  Not too much, but just enough to give him that young European look I know he has a thing for.  Whenever I see him after a time apart, he always looks just a bit different.  It's most pronounced in the first moment, but then he always turns back into the boy I knew in 9th grade.   Levi looked everywhere but at me, and I just sat, grinning and waiting.  Finally, we locked eyes and I barreled into him for the first time in half a year.  	 "How are you?" he asked my neck, laughing.  "Oh, I’m okay!" I replied to his ear, my legs wrapped around his waist.   	 I was at last introduced to the boy who'd stolen my best friend's heart and the three of us were on our way.  "Let's get a drink!" I said, only half-kidding. 	 "You know, we could.  The pubs open around 10 here." 	 We were the only ones talking during the half hour train ride into London.    "We could dress up as nuns and go bar-hoppin'," Grant suggested. 	 "I love that movie!" I exclaimed.  "Anyone who can work 'Steel Magnolias' quotes into casual conversation must be alright.  We are sooo going to get along, Grant." 	 Watching the sun rise over the English countryside suddenly reminded me of exactly where I was.  This was an entirely different world, complete with its own unique color, aroma, sound and feel.  Even the laundry hanging on clotheslines had a decidedly English look to them.  Or maybe that was just the jet lag.    It was 10 a.m. (3 a.m. to my body) before we emerged from the Underground and I got my first real look at another continent.  The walk to the house was spent oohhing and aahhing over every cobblestone and car parked on the owner's front yard.    ~~~  It's an odd feeling, really, to be both refreshed and completely exhausted at the same time.  After my shower and an exchange of Christmas presents, I fought to keep my head up as I pecked away at my ham sandwich.  "Okay," Levi said, asserting his authority, "you really need to take a nap." 	 "Yea, I probably do.  I've been up for about 24 hours by now."  "Don't sleep too much, though, 'cause that'll throw you off even worse than not sleeping at all.  I'll come get you if you sleep too long."  	 I’m never going to get used to these stairs.   They were entirely too steep for a two-story house, but I hadn't the strength to complain; it was all being used in my effort to remain upright while navigating them.  It wasn't even a house, really.  It was half of a house.  Everything was small, shrunk down to half the normal size.  I wondered how the flat would be without the wall of separation between each side.  From the outside, the structure looked like a fairly large home, but because of that dividing line, everything inside was reduced to fit two households into one actual house.    The room they prepared for me was smaller than the dorm room I spent two years cramped in, and the only bed covering was a heavy comforter.  Everything was white: the walls, the furniture, and the door, making it difficult to imagine the dark night my body thought it should be.  I pulled a turtleneck on over my top and snuggled close to the radiator.  	 How can they not have a single hairdryer in this house?  So what if it was built over a century ago?  Circuit-breakers, my ass.     The fog lifted slowly as he sat with me later, waiting for the go-ahead on the night's activities.  My hair was still cold and wet.  My body ached and my stomach cramped.  From hunger or an adrenaline hangover, I wasn't sure.  But I was finally here.  We were together, and I wasn't about to lay here, waiting for it to feel normal, by god.   "I think I can do dinner," I decided.  "We'll have to see about the movie, though."  Halfway to the restaurant: "Fuck it.  It's the goddamned 'Towers' for god's sake.  We've waited long enough."
