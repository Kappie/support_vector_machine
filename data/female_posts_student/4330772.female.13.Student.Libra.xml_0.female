This is very strange... maybe it's that Jon is funnier? Ah well, who gives a shit.      You know what I realized?  John  Kerry,  John  Edwards... John  Flansburgh,  John  Linnell. Cha, like we wouldn't notice. Nice shot at scoring a piece of the pie, Democratic presidential ticket.       There are too many Johns in my life right now... I have to take one of them out or something.       No wonder Comedy Central is owned by MTV, they run the same movies over and over just as MTV runs the same videos over and over. I've seen Dogma seventy thousand times over the last couple of months.   SOLD OUT! Cat's Cradle Carrboro, NC SAT, SEP 11  urlLink Franz Ferdinand    urlLink The Delays   urlLink The Futureheads  Doors: 8:00 pmShow: 9:00 pm SOLD OUT!!  That's right. Sold out... I've seen a bunch of unlucky bastards trying to find tickets over the internet. Good luck kids, I'll wait for youz inside.
