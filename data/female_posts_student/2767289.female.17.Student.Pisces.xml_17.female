We first started blaming Serge, now we're all aware of each other. We're making sure we don't touch each other's towels, don't touch the ice, don't share any food or drinks in order to not catch each others' germs. It's hilarious, though!    Earlier today, all four of us walk into Walgreens to get medicine. We're all standing there, sounding SICK! with these deep, scratchy voices... trying to decide which meds are better... So funny!!
