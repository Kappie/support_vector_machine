So that's pretty cool I guess. I need to make some new pals... I just have to be nice. My mom teaches a lot of people I know. Kinda weird... but as long as she's nice it won't be a problem. Damn I really wish I was in band. I'm not a big fan of art... it isn't my thing and I wish I was in band but my mommy and sissy are making me do art so I'm kinda upset. I don't know about my teachers yet... they all seem tolerable though. Two of my classes are mainly sophomores (AlgebraII and Chemistry)... people in Chemistry thought I was a Junior... wtf. Well I take that as a big compliment. I sit next to a really nice guy who is named Nolan. He is cuuute! haha Candice is being lame...  I think Bart's eating lunch with my friends tomorrow. Therefore, I will not be eating lunch with my friends tomorrow. Funny how that works...  Party on!  -Candice
