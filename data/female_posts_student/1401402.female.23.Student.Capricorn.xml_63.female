From friends to people who are willing to pay me to dance at a club, at a strip joint, and surprisingly, even at the bar. Thanks for the offer but no thank you.    I figure it is a gift, so why not use it rite? Dancing is one thing I really love most. I started dancing since I was in high school. Jazz, Broadway, Modern, hip-hop, ballet, African, sway, you name it. From my experience, what I really love  most was the performances. Maybe, because I love getting attention and I love the spotlights on center stage.  It changes my whole life around from this boring, shy, embarrass, Sakdary to this magnificent new person. Once I am on the dance floor, don't expect to see any shyness in me. I can go on and on and on all night long just like that energizer bunny.    I was once a choreographer for Ambition Studio but I gave that up because I fell my accomplishment. I did not get the edition and I am still sad god damnit. If I was chosen that night, I could have been living large in Vegas rite now. I could have been sitting in Monte Carlo, in front of the slot machine going cha ching cha ching.    I still practice at home when  ever I have time.  I still believed that if you practice and practice, you'll get it. I am not going to give up and let that go to waste, until I get what I want. This time I will come back strong, stronger then before. I don't want to be a pathetic loser.
