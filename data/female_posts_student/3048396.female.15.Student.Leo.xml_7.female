I've had some friends problems lately...I dunno people just started to get pissed at me n stuff...so I switched lunch tables..to be with some people who'd actually care...but I think that made the others even more angry. *shrug* Atleast now im getting closer with the few I have n stuff...but I dunno its just felt like Ive lost so many. I really don't care anymore...Im getting closer with Ashley which is fine by me since we had that lil talk earlier this week bout how we both kinda felt outta place...well I think Ive found mine now. So yeah. Not much is going on...Ive stoped eating lunch now..Im not even hungry then. I don't get hungry till about 3:30 so its alright. *sigh* Im just really in this depressed like mood *shrug* who knows...maybe im just tired. Tracy and I are working on our song with is coming along great. Yeah Pineapple. Its gonna go to the tune of Yeah Toast. Good times...yeah...heres what she pretty much thought of for now...  When the first Hawaiian got really hungry Didn't know what would go with his --- Musta been a retard got it in his head Buy the frickin pineapple shove it in your mouth get fed!  So yeah its amusing..we still need the other verses and some random words but it'll turn out great...so yeah I guess thats all for now...im super bored....and maybe I should go look for some food.....  -Tara
