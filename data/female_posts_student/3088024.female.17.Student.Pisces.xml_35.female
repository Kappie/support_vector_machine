It smells so nice.  I have not been alive for very many springs but I love them so much.  I  could be 1000 years old and never have seen Spring too many times.  Bathing in the sunlight walking in the rain.  Spring is so beautiful.  After Winter's long painful travail Spring has finally been born.  It makes life seem so whimsical and carefree and everyone seems happier.  I know I feel rejuvenated.  I turned in an application to Old Navy and I really hope I get a job but if it is not the Lord's will then it is not the Lord's will.  Let it be...  I think I may be bipolar.  I dunno but the weather really does have an effect on my attitude.  *Shouts for joy*
