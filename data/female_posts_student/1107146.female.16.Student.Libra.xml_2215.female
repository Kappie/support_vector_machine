Will of Whiteside really has confirmed it. I'll bring a camera sometime and take a picture of you. It's been a while since this thread ended, I know, yes, yes. But that really needed to be commented upon s'more. It's pretty much got me out of the ass-detonation business (at least to the extent that I'll share with anyone more than the people who are there to witness :):):) i  Peace, buds.
