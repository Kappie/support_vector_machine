I had a dream last night that I really could have done without. It just brought back waaaaaay old memories. It wasn't a bad dream, but it was discouraging. But I'm glad that it was. Because life in that aspect has always been a bit discouraging as well. And I need to forget about it.  I love summer so much. I have alot to look forward to this summer. First of all, I can look forward to next Tuesday. But I'm not telling why. Just make it a point to see me in about a week. Ahh, I can't wait. Hopefully I can look forward to this Saturday, because Fall Out Boy is playing at Club Indigo, but I'm not sure if it's an all-age show. If it's not...I'm going to cry. I can look forward to my birthday in  19 days!  Of course I don't get my license until late July. A shame. But something else to look forward to nevertheless.  There is more, but I suppose I don't want to ramble too much. I think I'll get going now. I've got things to do today.  Look forward to great things, crazies.
