At least Miles is happy with the poem. Ian has yet to talk to his mother. I think I might break out the rosary for this one. I think God's sick of me saying "If you do this, I'll become a nun!" though.  Oops.  Maybe this one last time...    Today is Bastille Day!  I stormed Herb Parsons Lake with my bike in honor of this lovely French holiday. Last Bastille Day, Derek gave me a Celine Dion CD to celebrate it. I'm going to miss little things like that. Perhaps I shall go pull out Celine and dance. Ahh...  No wait! I can't dance! I'm too busy packing! Yes, as of today, I will be leaving in a week to go far away to  Pensacola, FL  with Randi and my surrogate family to find seashells, check out boys I'll never have, and hang out on the beach. Then, I will return home and the next morning I will catch a flight down to  Dallas, TX  to be with my  amazing  cousins, the only people I really love to be around on Dad's side.    I can storm as much as you  Bring the rains and lightning too  I could cause a hurricane  In an altered view of pain  Fire would be blazing bright  Winds whipping in the night Hail could just come falling down And still would not create a sound Thunder would creep along the way  To embrace the night or curse the day Tornadoes would have a job that's kind  To sweep bad memories from my mind A storm to clear my head from grief  To blow away what all I've seen  To somehow form a new clean slate Someday soon before it's too late  I'd control nature just for a time   Even if it's only inside of my mind    Do you ever have one of those times when you just write like crazy?  It's quite fun.
