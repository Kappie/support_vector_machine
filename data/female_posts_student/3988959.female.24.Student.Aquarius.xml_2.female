Ranging in size from 2 to 15, and weighing up to 25 tonnes. The Plesiosauria family is divided into 2 superfamiles; Plesiosauriodea and Pliosauroidea, having important differences as well as similar features. Fossils of the jurassic Plesiosaurs (Plesiosaurus and Cryptoclidus) and Pliosaurs (Liopleurodon) have been found in Europe, while remains of the cretaceous Plesiosaur (Elasmosaurus) and Pliosaur (Kronosaurus) have been discovered in Asia/North America and Queensland, Australia respectively.  Members of the Plesiosauriodea superfamily are described as generally having long necks and small heads, with forelimbs generally larger than the hind limbs. The Pliosauroidea superfamily had shorter necks but much larger heads, with extremely powerful jaws. Plesiosaurs were efficient swimmers, but it is believed that their hunting styles were varied in accordance with their shape. It is believed that the Plesiosaurus gracefully "flew" through the water in search of prey, laying in wait, highly manoeuvrable and able to turn on the spot in ambush of prey (1), while Cryptoclidus were very agile long distance swimmers and would pursue much more active prey, hunting by the chase. (2)  As Plesiosaurs hunted at depth for long periods of time, they would have had to develop specialised anatomical and physiological traits to withstand the immense pressure and energy debt that such diving put on their bodies. Several factors are known to impede the ability of any animal to dive to great depth, be they mammalian or reptilian. The problems posed by deep sea diving consist of maintenance of homeostasis through immense pressure, decompression, lack of oxygen, and thermoregulation.  This essay will explain the possible adaptations Plesiosaurs developed to survive in their environment with respect to the mechanisms that marine animals use to maintain homeostasis in a deep diving environment.      The pressure exerted upon the torso of a Plesiosaur at 200 meters would have been roughly equivalent to 21 atmospheres. It is known for Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) to dive to much larger depths than this.  It is shown through the fossil record that Plesiosaurs had long, wide bodies. For such deep dives to be possible without harm to the animal, a sort of protective "cage" would need to surround the internal organs to avoid being crushed by  immense pressure, yet the cage itself would need to be flexible and collapse to a degree to keep internal pressure equal to the pressure of the sea. The Plesiosaur overcame this hurdle with a series of dense, closely packed gastralia, or “belly ribs”. These ribs made the torso rigid and able to withstand the pressures of the deep sea, yet flexible enough to almost totally collapse. These ribs also protected the internal organs of the plesiosaur when the animal left the ocean to lay its eggs on the beach. The external shells of modern turtles have the basic same function, providing rigidity at great depths, and protection of the internal tissues when surfacing to lay eggs. It is possible that smaller Plesiosaurs used their gastralia as protection from predation. (3)  When diving to depths of greater than 30 meters and resurfacing, some humans experience a condition known commonly as "the bends" or decompression sickness. It is basically caused by nitrogen which has come out of solution in the divers blood and formed small bubbles of gas in the surrounding tissues. Decompression sickness is a serious and potentially fatal side effect of deep dives, but many marine reptiles and mammals frequently dive and resurface without any ill effect. There are 2 possible mechanisms the Plesiosaur could have employed to overcome decompression sickness during frequent dives.  The first mechanism would be similar to the one employed by the Leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) , in that the skeleton and skin are suffused with a large amount of oily polyunsaturated fatty acids. The excess nitrogen bubbles are believed to enter this oily insulating layer where they can be stored until such time as they can be excreted by the animal with no detrimental effect to the animal or its tissues. (4)  Secondly, and most importantly, the Plesiosaur would not have suffered the bends during its long and frequent dives for the same reason that marine animals today do not suffer the bends during dives; that is, they only have the percentage of gas mixtures in the breath they take with them at the surface for the entire dive. The small amount of nitrogen that would be present in that one breath would hardly be enough to saturate the blood with nitrogen, would easily decompress to the same volume upon resurfacing and would leave the bloodstream and fill the lungs to be exhaled at the surface. (5)   The plesiosaur must have had the facility for storage and sustained utilisation of oxygen to allow it to be such an active hunter at great depths. To accomplish this, it must have had the ability to regulate its heart rate and metabolism of oxygen by its tissues.   Deep diving animals have very similar physiological adaptations to their environment. An animal that submerges for extended periods of time must be able to efficiently store large amounts oxygen in its tissues, and be able to utilise it through anaerobic mechanisms. Turtles and Seals, such as the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) use identical physiological mechanisms to store and utilise the oxygen during a deep sea dive, so it is very likely that Plesiosaurs also utilised similar mechanisms. Deep diving animals have a tremendous ability to store oxygen- up to twice as much per kilogram of body weight compared to a human- and do this by storing the oxygen in tissues which are not used for respiration. Animals such as the Weddell seal store only 5% of their oxygen in the lungs, and around 70% in their blood (6) and about twice as much in their muscles compared to a human. Storage of oxygen in non-respirative tissues is vastly more efficient than storage in the lungs as it allows for a greater capacity to do anaerobic activity. The two oxygen storing proteins responsible for this increased capacity to store oxygen are haemoglobin (in the blood) and myoglobin (in the muscles), and diving animals have large amounts of these proteins present in their tissues. Haemoglobin present in the blood of the Plesiosaur would serve much the same purpose as haemoglobin in any animal,  to transport the oxygen which is absorbed from the lungs and bonded to haemoglobin to the tissues of the body. It is possible that the plesiosaur had a comparatively large spleen, able to store large amounts of blood, which contracted during a dive, suffusing the blood stream with oxygen-enriched blood and providing more oxygen for use by tissues. (6) The myoglobin contained in the muscle fibers of the Plesiosaur would have provided the greatest oxygen stockpile for use by this active deep diver. during periods of oxygen deprivation when bursts of activity were needed, such as chasing prey or evading predators, the myoglobin (oxymyoglobin in its oxygen-bound state) would release its oxygen and generate ATP via glycolysis. The generation of ATP via glycolysis is preferable for quick release of energy, as it requires fewer steps than oxidative phosphorylation (aerobic ATP production), and is able to proceed in the absence of oxygen altogether. (7) The disadvantage to glycolysis for energy production is the generation of the waste product lactic acid, which cannot be broken down into any useable molecules, and accumulates in the muscles causing fatigue and acidifying of the blood. The Plesiosaur must have had a high tolerance to muscle fatigue and blood acidosis to be able to sustain anaerobic activity for long periods of time, much in the same way that crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) do. (8)  Even the large amounts of oxygen available to the Plesiosaur can be expended in a very short time without the ability to maintain and conserve the oxygen stored. The Plesiosaur would have accomplished this by decreasing its heart rate and therefore its oxygen consumption. An example of this is the ability of the green turtle to decrease its heart rate to one beat every 9 minutes during the deepest part of its dive. The Plesiosaur must have had receptors called Baroreceptors, which are sensitive to changes in blood pressure, present in its heart and carotid artery. The baroreceptors would constantly provide information about blood pressure and adjust cardiac output to sustain normal blood pressure. Therefore, as depth increases and the pressure on the body and blood vessels increases, so does the blood pressure. Baroreceptors would trigger an autonomic reflex and slow the heart rate down to normalise blood pressure. (9)  The final obstacle to any deep diving animal is the ability to regulate temperature. It is possible that the plesiosaur was a warm-blooded reptile, but only insofar as it used a thermoregulatory process known as giganothermy. leatherback turtles utilise this mechanism with great success both in the water and on land. The gigantothermic process involves low metabolic rate, a temperature control mechanism called counter-current heat exchange, a large amount of insulative tissues and sheer size to operate.  Gigantotherms use their large body size to keep warm. This is possible as a gigantotherms body core is much further away from the surface than a smaller reptile, and temperature fluctuations occuring on the surface do not affect a gigantotherms internal temperature to any great degree. It is this surface area to mass ratio, together with counter-current heat exchange which allows a gigantotherm to maintain a stable body temperature both in near freezing and warm conditions. Counter-current heat exchange operates by shunting blood away from the surface tissues and to the animals core when in cold temperatures (such as hunting in the arctic seas) to maintain a stable internal temperature, and shunting blood to the external tissues when in warm temperatures (when laying eggs on a warm beach) to lessen the temperature gradient between its internal temperature and the external temperature. As the animal would have a large amount of insulative tissues surrounding its organs and underneath its surface tissues, keeping its core warm even in sub-artic temperatures would not be a great problem. The leatherback turtle is able to maintain a temperature between 18 and 25 degrees celcius regardless of the external environment, if the Plesiosaur utilised giantothermy it may have been able to keep a similar internal temperature. (10)  The Plesiosaur was an amazing marine reptile, which may have utilised some amazing physiological and anatomical adaptations refined in mammals and reptiles of today, with the ability to survive extremes of temperature, pressure and physical stress in the prehistoric ocean. The length of survival of the species would certainly have depended on their adaptability to both the aquatic and terrestrial environment, shown in their metabolic and  thermoregulatory mechanisms and anatomy.     references:  (1) Worth, G.
