My mom is a kindergarten teacher, my dad is in insurance.  My younger brother is the idiot savant of the family, unless you are talking to him about quantum physics he has little to say.  He called my cell a couple weeks ago to ask how to mail a transcript, does it really need an address?  yes.  Its almost humorous, but he was serious.  No the mail carrier has esp.  My dog has cancer and my unboyfriend after dating since feb. has no desire for a relationship.  Maintaing the status quo.  My best friend in school, Tracy, is great.  I just never thought I would be best friends with the ultimate in sorority girls, with her new BMW SUV.  Lots of acronyms, eh?  My mom has M.S. and my goal in law school is to con her into early retirement.  So, I guess if thats the end, the means would more prudently be in law school that english lit.  But, am I sacrificing life to do so?  Yeah.  Sometimes I am.  I miss the freedom of undergrad, the "I think I'll change my major today [and thus the rest of my life]" the possibilities were tantamount to liberty. I am in a chain gang of sorts now.  I don't know what the cool music on the radio is.  How did I get to be buddies with the pretty girls.  The ones you hated in high school.  Am I THEM?  No.  Definitely not. [there's the rainman in me]  I miss romance and mystery and excitement.  Do we all?
