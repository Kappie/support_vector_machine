I hope my group clicks as well as we did last year.  I've never met any of them, and I talked to one kid on aim once and another kid on aim twice or so.  No one else is from Massachusetts, so this will be interesting.  I am stoked, to steal a phrase from Jesse.  Ok, I had better get back to packing and watching  Bandits .  Over and Out....for now...
