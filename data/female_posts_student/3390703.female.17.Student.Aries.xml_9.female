Lori and Charles pleasured each other in my bed!  It makes me sad because my bed was a virgin to sexual activity ... and now it isn't!  Ohhh ... so I was rubbing Charles' leg and I thought I was feeling his knee, but it wasn't and then he screamed pervert and it was so funny because I had no idea I was rubbing anything else!  hehe  Then Karina and Mark came over and I took everyone home, except for Lori, Karina, and Mark!  We all went to Lori's house and hung out there!  Lori got in trouble for ditching!  It was sad!  And then all the guys were making fun of her because of Charles and I felt sad for her and she cried to me!  (( tear ))  Then my mom called and yelled at me because I'm failing design because I haven't turned in my sketchbooks!  So I brought Lori home with me!  She drew feet for me and it made me happy!  Then we made dinner for my family because I needed a way to suck up!  It was yummie and I was proud of us!  Lori doesn't put dressing on her salad and I thought it was funny because yeah, the dressing makes it so much better!  Then Chris Naumen came over at it was really weird because he's fat now and has a mohawk and a lip peircing and yeah, it was just weird because he used to be so preppy!  Then I took Lori home!  When I got home I got yelled at by my dad because he likes to be stupid and that was the end of it!  I "talked" to Rachel last night, and it was interesting!  She said that I caused her pain that's going to last her a lifetime and that sometimes she questions the decision she made about me, but she knows that it will turn out ok in the end!  And that we should just forget that we ever existed!  I don't know, it was something like that!  I didn't really remember because I don't tend to pay attention to people that aren't my friends!  Now, if we were friends then I would have memorized every word of it, but we're not so oh well!  So I told her that I could never forget all about her because she was my good friend, and no matter how hard I try I couldn't forget about her because that would be stupid! Oh, Rachel also said that we should stop talking shit about each other in our journals!  And then after she does that I read her journal and it has some more stuff about me!  I think that is ... stupid!  If you don't want me to write about you then please, don't write about me!  Ummm ... I'm going to hang out with Nathan later on today and it makes me happy!  I have nothing else to say about today, yet!
