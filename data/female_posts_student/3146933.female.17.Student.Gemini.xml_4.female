It's just like my last one...good thing b/c I missed my old one :( ! But yeah and it feels right b/c I was drivin a jeep and i felt so high up and now im back down on the road like i should be. :D! The most AMAZING thing happened to me the other day. I talked to Matt. No, I mean conversation. He talked to me too. Like...we're friends. Do you have...ANY idea how great that felt? It felt great. I miss him. I got a graduation invitation from him in the mail and..I cried for an hour after i got it :/ . B/c I was already missin him before i got it and then after i got it, i was just..so confused..? It's weird. But I wanna do somethin for him for graduation. I hope he'll let me. Or at least get him something. I don't want him to move off without seeing me at least one more time..you know? I'll always love him! I know he's got to always love me too... Anyways, but yeah and these other guys that I was thinkin about 'talkin' with or whatever..no..they either try too hard to get me to like them, or they're immature, or they're boring, or ... there's just always something. I just don't want them I want Matt. Ok. If I do not sound pathetic. I know I do, and I'm sure you're thinkin the same exact thing...but I really don't care what anyone thinks. I can't help it! for some reason i can't let go of him, even after what happened when we broke up. but I'll try... I have 7 or 8 days left of school. then I'll be a senior...last year...it kinda makes me wanna shed a tear. but what they hey! Time sure goes by fast..
