Soon there is going to be news story about Kerry's affairs which will destroy his campaign. Democrats setting him up like a little bitch. Did you know he sent his secutary/one time lover to Africa so that the media wouldn't catch her. Well once the media pulls all the info together, they'll publish it. At least that's what i heard from someone from Bill Bradely's office... New SUVs are also coming out, of course the majority of them japanese, that are environmentally 'good'. There was something I was going to post that was actually kewl... but's it early and my brain isn't working right... right so here is a filler:  urlLink The Original Pitfall , now you can play it online. This isn't that 2k3 shit either. Oh yea... if you wanna read 'quality' blogs, click that little TBBL thing on the side bar, and it take you to the 'blogs that evolve'... still only a worm... at least not a microbe....
