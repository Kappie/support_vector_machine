Then we did the throw a pie at improv people and my grandpa won to throw a pie at me. It was so funny! Then this other person threw a bucket of water at me and I got wet. It was really cold. So I was a big lump of creamy wetness. It was great!!  Then i went home and took a super long shower. It was reallllll nice!! I don't feel like blow drying my hair so its gonna be really curly but thats ok.  I was sitting next to Jacki, Jennifer, and Christina and they were talking about my Turtle and christian was like "He is toooooo skinny for me!! I don't want a boy who is skinner than ME!" And I was like "Uh..ok..he isn't that skinny." She was calling herself fat. Haha. Well, acctualy the turtle was skinny, but I like skinny white boys.  Just when i thought her eyelashes coudln't get more disgusting..they did. *cringes* They are like an inch thick!!!
