Why can't things be the way they were? I liked it that way. Let me tell you about my great weekend. So Saturday, I go to Josh's to have some Halloween fun and go to a corn maze (w/ Charlotte... and...etc...) and haunted house. So the corn maze, we get there, Josh has a really reaaally bad headache and we're pretty much leading him around ("Of all places to be sick, Josh, you had to be sick in a labyrinth of corn!!!"). Yeah my favorite part was when he threw up. Good times. So when we finally get back to Josh's, I drive home real quick to change my shoes and get money for the haunted house, but when I get back everyone's gone. So I sit on the doorstep and see that I have a missed call from Charlotte. Everyone went home; they took Josh to the hospital. Yeah he has mengingitis. You can die from that. And now we could all have it. He had to get a shot in his spine! Oh god... Josh I love you, I hope you are okay!!!  So anyway, then I went to Charlotte's (down the street)...and she's had an equally horrible month, more so actually... so we talked for ever, then I got us Chinese food at Safeway and we watched The Princess Bride. It was quite the girl's night. It was so ridiculously neccessary. It's so funny how I always say how much I hate drama but that seems to be all that's happening lately. *** Well today was better... me, my mom and my sisters went to the HALLOWEEN SUPERSTORE (ooore ooore oooorrre!!!) and I got the cutest Tinkerbell costume shit it's so adorable... not that I'll be able to go anywhere in it anymore.. (i'll find something). And we got some cool things for our house... but mostly I spent my time talking to this cute clerk who worked the dressing rooms ("How's this one?).. he had the greatest pickup line.. "So..do you go to...school...?" Cute. Then we got pumpkins. And I finished my Alice in Wonderland poster. So yeah today was better. Oh but Misty died. :( :( :( *** In other news, this week I've decided to become active in finding a job, (I must work in a record storrrre! not gonna happen, but I can try...that or a pet store) and I can have a Halloween party if I want, but if that doesn't work out then all you guys who have to go to the football game you can come sleepover at my house.
