Obnoxiously happy and the whole thing. This really has been so good for me, having a boyfriend. I've needed to be softened for so long and I haven't really even realised it. I still am having trouble expressing myself emotionaly but I slowly work on that as Paul begins to put down his beariers also. we spend alot of time talking about the future. This is gonna last us a long time. At least untill the end of high school, we are sure of it. I know it sounds very optomistic but we seem to be so well suited for each other that there is no possible thing to get in the way. And I know I want it to last a long time because I am just loving this. Who knows where it will take us. The relationship definately has the potential. Now the final obsticle, telling ou parents. We have been waiting for his dad to come home from Iraq to tell them. So we have concoted a plan where i tell them all at dinner. I know I should be nervious about it but I don't seem to be. I know that they could turn on us and ruin this perfect thing that we have going but it doesn't concern me. right now I am just lost in the moment and really don't want to come back to reality.
