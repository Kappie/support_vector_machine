And if so, for what reasons? Sean Landis posed this question in his Xanga, and I decided to answer it. I really don't know if I would.  On one hand: you do get to watch the progress of human history, which is very cool in itself. You can actually find out if you were right about what's going to send the world to hell. You get to indulge all the new technology, hell, probably see space farther than our generation will ever know (most likely, and Steven Hawking is a douche, all of you that believe him are pseudo-intellectual pussies, and I bet half of you don't know what the bloody fuck he's talking about in the first place. Don't spout off his rhetoric, give me some of your own fucking proof, assholes...just had to get that out), basically, you get to live the stuff we can only dream about now. That would be super-awesome.  But then the bad. Well, first of all, I would have to live with being a bipolar for the rest of eternity, which is always fucking awful in general. Of course, that doesn't apply to everyone, so yar. But secondly, I would leave behind all of my friends, family, those that I love. I don't think I could really handle it...I don't think the rest of you could, either, could you? If you say yes, you have no soul, what the hell are you doing on this BLog you homewrecker? And if you say no, haha, you codependent, totally non-self-reliant, tagalong. I AM JUST KIDDING! Really. I'm seriously codependent, so there. Like, really. Sometimes it hurts. I guess that's what codependency is all about. But whatever.  Hmm...so the answer in my case would have to be no. Fuck living forever, that would suck. And if I had to, I would just go ahead and rope myself, since that  would  work, per this example. Egh.  HEY ROSIE! My therapist said something the other day that was quite interesting. She said: "If they're (the Phil triad, in this case) still fighting after this long a time, they're just doing it because they like it." Would you consider this to be valid? I would, actually. But, eh, it's not my big issue, and you have your own brain. We're (me, Linds, Becca, Philip) going out to eat tomorrow night. I haven't talked to any of ye'all in quite a while, so I'll see through them how everything is going, I guess.  It's tea time biotch! Actually no, that was five minutes ago. I finished it long before this post. Eh, I give. I'm tired, this is ridiculous. If you actually read all this, be sure to tell me to have your children, I'm serious. This is a real feat.  Actually, Linds is the only one that actually reads all of this, so Linds: I'm having your children. Man, what a braintrip to read in the middle of a post. Well, the end of a post. Man, I'm getting sick of typing. But I thought I would just type this much because, eh: I can. Anyway Linds, anytime you're ready, you can just infuse me with your children. It'll suck and all for a while, I don't know if guys are equipped to circumvent morning sickness very well, or labor pains. Hell, we can't even do breathing exercises very great. I think that's normally why our jobs are so limited. By the way, I'm sorry I got so close to your car last night when we pulled in. Yeah, I know it wasn't a big deal, and here I am guilting about it. I seriously need some help.  Speaking of, I'm fucking done.   the end
