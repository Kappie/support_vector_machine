I don't know what to tell Marie....how am I supposed to know what's best for her? I hate giving advice. It's like "Tell me advice or I'll hate you." That or "Tell me advice, it'll be wrong, and I'll hate you anyways." It's a lose lose situation.   Hardee's is disgusting. There are too many ego-hungry girls there. Gary, the GM, is a dick. But hey, Kenny, the hot 18 year old drive through guy is funny. A "friend" came in today! Kenny said that he only saw him in there once before today, but has a feeling that he'll be in a lot from now on, and I am in agreeance. It's scary. I'll just have to be the "fry girl" whenever he walks in. Haha.    Tomorrow is our first tennis match! I MADE THIRD SINGLES!!!!!!! Wish me luck.
