So I figured if everyone else jumped off the cliff, why wasn't I invited. So, here I am. *looks* An epidemic is sweeping my school. Children are all snufling and coughing, and most are out of school completely. I'm dealing with allergies and a lovely head cold, and I can only treat one a day so its been...interesting. This very flu-like cold is reachings its sickly arms to my father, and has completely claimed my brother. He's been sleeping since 3, and its 7 now. Most of my friends are gone, and those who remain are listless and tired.  My cat is dreaming in her sleep again. She sounds like she's eating something.  I'm done. I'm tired. Another migraine is trying to take over, and I want to eat my chicken.
