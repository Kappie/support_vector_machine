"tortilla with meat, cheese, and vegetables" "uh huh and what's a casadilla?" "tortilla with meat, cheese, and vegetables" "yes, and what is a burrito?" "tortilla with meat, cheese, and vegetables". well it was funnier when he did it, but you get the point.  i have to write a comparitive essay for my final exam in english. why do i care now? because we get to choose our own topics and i might actually put effort into schoolwork ((more than whats required by law, that is))((but i still maintain my A-B average)). i'm thinking i'll do a "Comprehensive Comparison of Modern Surrealist Art and Modern Abstact Art, With Emphasis on Dali and Picasso". people are constantly getting the two of them confused!!! it drives me nuts! i say "yeah dali and bosch are cool" and they're like "ooh you like abstract stuff like that? i just like the picture with the lady and she's almost smiling but not really and i think it got stolen one time and i'm a retard la ti da". but anyways, i'm sure i could find many a candidate to debate the philosophy of non-conventional art, but i figure no matter how long we go at it i'll still think i'm right anyway. ((wink wink))  today was good considering everything i'm supposed to be worried about. i don't think i mentioned the fact that i'm not supposed to know my grandmother is sick and that i only foud out by eavesdropping, so i think i'm supposed to pretend i don't know anything until somebody decideds to tell me. alas, i am never out of the loop! these people are waaaay too sloppy. ((i love using the word alas))((alas))((alas! alas is one of my favorite words!)). so in the midst of feigning naivity i aced 3 tests, chilled out, and learned some fascinating new stuff in geometry. i am sooo taking trig, which is what we're doing now. ((trig in geometry? whatev)).   so now i'm gonna steal a couple topics from other people's blogs. TIF reminded me of Amish people. i love Amish people, they rock. it's kind of weird though... i mean they're so religious and close minded... that i would think they were cool. but i went to iowa and met a girl my age who was Amish, and i think it was her... zest? that made me like them so much. the fact that her life was complete and that she didn't yearn for anything more, the fact that consisstency and tight-nit groups of farmers were comforting and the right thing rather than an awful bore and a terrible way to live. amish just... apreicate everything. and that makes me apreciate them.   ((plus they make kickass fudge and booya cheese, which is about 50% of the Amish love i feel))  and the other day i was thinking about the disney channel and then BOOKGIRL mentioined it and i decided it would make a good rant((why does the word 'rant' appear so often in blogs))((could it be because that's exactly what they are?)). anyways, i digress:   i think the disney channel is majorly fcuked up. why? becuase THERE ARE ONLY THREE FRAKING PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THAT CHANNEL! and it true!!!! everybody on that channel: 1. has thier own show 2. randomly appears on all the other disney shows 3. have thier own cartoon character that they do the voice for 4. appear SOMEWHERE in almost all disney movies, even if they are just walk-ons 5. have thier own "singing careers" so they can be played on "radio disney" 6. appear in the disney commercials and do the little announcer voices for the disney channel and finally 7. have thier own mini-specials on disney so we can "get to know them better".   the most obvious example, of course, is hilary duff. and even if most of what she does gets on my last nerve, i say more power to her and if i was as hott as her, i'd strut it too. and also that little short fat kid that looks like a midget but i don't know his name.  speaking of midgets, i like reality tv((as many people don't)), but sometimes it goes too far!!!! like on "The Littlest Groom" a midget version of the bachelor, i mean, COME ONE PEOPLE! and besides, isn't singling out small people bad? and also there is a new one called "Straight Plan for the Gay Man" ((can anyone say copyright infringement?)), a spoof on Queer Eye and yet another stupid show. my favorite reality shows are survivor, star search, and american idol, and i suppose the last two are more of televised talent shows, but whatev.   i think i'm going to invite shane for sushi with me. betcha a million dollars he's never tried any raw eel wrapped in fungi and soaked in soy bean essence. actually that was a tad exxagerated, sushi is the bestest! and i only eat the cooked eel, it's too chewy raw.   i have bla bla trig to do and i have to read "Night" ((please god say you all know which book i'm talking about)), which is extremely depressing, gruesome, and downright mind warping. but hey! morehead wouldn't assign something without those qualifications! and besides, it's kind of inspiring in a crematorial, using babies for target practice kind of way.  that was a yucky note to end my blog on, so perhaps this is better:  do yall know how jellyfish reproduce?! it's amazing! the male and female jelly fish spit out gametes and they form a bud on the ocean floor which then forms layers of disks and when there are lots of layers, the disks flake off and turn into baby jellyfish!   and sorry for not spellchecking... butt i donut hav tiem
