Today I woke up and put on my work cloths (including the pick nick shirt which always gets questions when I wear it for load in or n e thing) Then Rachel came and I went to the library for books for the trip. I got Oliver Twist and Fehrenhieght 451 for summer reading. I also have Ethan Frome kicking around. I am not sure what I will read. I also got the 2nd newest xanth book, which I have not read yet and an older one which I really want to read and a few other things. We are probably going to listen to books on CD on the way up though. Then I worked on packing up kitchen things. This whole time, of course, we were watching the Olympics. I don't like summer Olympics as much as winter Olympics but you gotta watch! Then after becoming VERY TIRED we ate dinner and watched some of Reign of Fire. (an excellent movie in witch Matthew McConaughey plays someone butch for a change) Now I have come online to blog. I am so annoyed that I still haven't got to talk to Ben! Now I may never know what I wanted to tell him! I also need to call Andrew while I am away. He's been really busy and I've been really sad! Well love to Ben and Andrew! I will talk to you guys soon. So I cannot believe that i forgot to tell you the most important news of like my entire life. Yesterday my father told his boss that he was leaving. This makes it real! He cannot chicken out! I love Rachel and Christian but the fact that dad lives out here kind of makes my life miserable except for the fact that I get to see them. Rachel is coming camping with me so that is really awesome. It won't be so boring. But anyways the first time my father told me he was leaving MI I actually cried tears of joy. I have never cried tears of joy before! I will miss Rachel and Christian so much but God! I am so happy. But It's also weird to look around at all of these places that I have seen my whole life and realize that I may never see them again. April may have been the last time I will ever see the butterflies at Frederick Meijer Garden. Next week may be the last time I will ever go to the Kava house. A week from Friday will be the last time I ever see Dad's apartment. After all these years (15 years 7 months and 24 days) it seems like I could never leave. I love you especially to Christian and Rachel and to my HCT friends and Marissa and everyone else who reads this blog and all my other friends!. Have wonderful weeks and I will see you on Monday. (for my last Monday in MI)
