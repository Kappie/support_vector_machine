YaY for life in general being good right now. :)  So, today was a pretty good day. We got to be on Good Morning America for marching band. That's so neat. First the Nicolas Cage movie and now Good Morning America. I knew marching band would pay off somehow someday. :) Anyway, that was fun and then...school. Blah, blah, blah. That was pretty dull.  I'm ao excited I get to go out with my friends tonight. It's just amazing. :) YaY One Acts'. Whoooo.   I also get my car back today which is really nice. I thought it'd take longer. Plus, it only cost 60 bucks. I thought repairing my brakes would be a few hundred so, that's nice. :) Anyway, I'm off to go do something other than homework because...A. I don't have any and B. it's Friday.  :-D
