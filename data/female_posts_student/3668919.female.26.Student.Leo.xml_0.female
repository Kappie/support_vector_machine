I then early this week dropped my intake down from 1480 to 1300 and I gained a pound.  How discouraging.  I have been pretty faithfully exercising, at least 4 times a week and have been so good and careful about what I eat and I feel that I am at a stand still.  I mean come on, I only want to lose another 7 lbs. you'd think I needed to lose 100!  Plus as good as it felt to exercise yesterday I so over did it.  My neck and shoulders just ache, but I know I cannot give in.  I need to get out there tonight and get my butt moving.  On a different subject, would you believe this weekend I have to work at my other job both Saturday  Sunday from 7am-4pm.  WTF was my boss thinking.  As it is I work my day job M-F 8am-5pm, then I have school two nights a week.  Then she gives me the morning shift BOTH days of the weekend.  I am going to absolultey die.  Oh well, while the rest of the world is enjoying their day, I will be working my life away.  Jenny
