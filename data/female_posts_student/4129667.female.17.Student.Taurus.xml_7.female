This is both a good and bad thing, since it's the weekend and really nice out and I want to frolic up here with friends... but visiting Dad now means that I'll get my bike for the rest of the summer, and we won't have to go down for a while after this. Hmm. Since I don't really have a choice, I won't complain.  Highlights (or lowlights) from yesterday: ~ Joe losing his glasses for like 3 hours, then finding them under the bed ~ my AWESOME new tee-ball gloves that will be used for field hockey ~ "I will save you from the manitee!"  - me ~ Hearing something rattle around inside our digital camera  I wish the camera worked.  And I hope to God Dad sent in the warenty... I'm scared to ask.  Ciao all :)  Oh, PS.  the times on here are all messed up, I'll have to work on that...?  Lol.
