SugarCult- Pretty Girl(The Way)   " Pretty girl is suffering  while he confesses everything  Pretty soon she'll figure out what his intentions were about   And that's what you get for falling again    You can never get him out of your head    She's beautiful as usual with bruises on her ego  and  Her killer instinct tells her to  beware of evil men   And that's what you get for falling again  You can never get him out of your head   It's the way that he makes you feel   It's the way that he kisses you   It's the way that he makes you fall in love   It's the way that he makes you cry   It's the way that he's in your mind   It's the way that hemakes you fall in love"    I barely know this person and he is all I think about. I want it to stop, but I can't make it. I don't do this, I don't fall in love, especially not when it's impossible, yet I find myself searching for every possible way to talk to him or see him. It's crazy, and it's driving me crazy. I tell myself it won't work and I should give up and stop, but then the what ifs always come back, and he isn't exactly helping my efforts. So far the only red flag is the distance, and I've already made my excuse to ignore that... and for some reason I can't ignore all the reasons in the back of my mind that are making me strongly consider it... I'm crazy... but then something will stand out to me that makes me thinkI'm not...  A long time ago, my youth pastor taught a lesson on marriage and dating and all that. It was very good and I remember much of it(sadly I didn't think the same at the time). He had us make a list of the qualities we wanted our future spouses to have. Of course some of them were very superficial and immature(as I was in junior high), but most were not. I switched rooms with my parents a while ago and went through tons of old stuff(i'm a keeper..not a throwing away kind of person), and low and behold I found this list... and the part that scares me the most, this person has a lot of the qualities I listed as a naive thirteen year old. Whether that means at thirteen I knew what I wanted or at almost seventeen I'm still imature and materialistic, I do not know, but I hope the former. It just creeps me out... I don't like the idea that I might be becoming a stupid teenage girl who is infatuated to the point she thinks she might actually... I can't even say it... bottom line: I'm crazy.
