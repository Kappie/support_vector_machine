I am very excited….I bought a kite today…for 43p – that’s like 68cents.  What a bargain. Have yet to see how far my 43p gets me when it comes to flying it!!  Was thinking about making kites with the kids but not quite sure how to – is it just a diamond shape with a cross of poles? They make it look easy in Mary Poppins.  Any suggestions?  Also Katelyn: where do you get fabric pens from?   On Saturday we (my flatmates and I) had a BBQ – it was great fun especially because I got to be in charge of the BBQ – which I was NEVER allowed as a kid – I think I’m a bit of a pyromaniac actually.  And we had – what I’ve learnt you call – s’mores. Yummy.  Rupal and I watched ‘The Last Samurai’ it was so good, but so sad.  I’m excited because Rupal is probably staying in Birmingham next year (she is my flatmate who is Indian but from Kenya – the one I went to the Temple with).  I’m really pleased because I get on well with her, we have such a laugh and are always winding each other up.  Once her exams have finished and I’ve handed in my assignments we are going to do some day trips to Stratford-Upon-Avon (Shakespeare’s place), Warwick castle, Cadburys World (apart from Melanie and Ron, did you guys realise that where they make all the Cadburys Chocolate is here in Birmingham? Its just down the road from the university) and other things.     I have a job interview tomorrow. Don’t want the job, but thought the practice would be good as I haven’t had that many interviews. So ought to head for bed.  Good night guys
