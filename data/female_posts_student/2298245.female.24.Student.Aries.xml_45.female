But alas, sometimes it still befuddles me the things that go on in this crazy world.   Par example , (I thought about saying "to wit" but didn't want to sound too much like a philosopher) there are rumblings of noisy maintenance in the library.  Now, I realize that it is the last day of exams, but considering that every 1L  2L has an exam today (this representing over 2/3 of the school because the 1L class is huge), it does not seem unreasonable to assume that it should be quiet up here, epsecially since 2 is supposed to be one of the quieter floors.  A little noise I could understand...I mean, maintenance doesn't stop just because exams are in full gear...and most of the maintenance people here at St. John's are very courteous.  So perhaps I'll cut the guys behind me a break, in the holiday spirit and all.  As for the students...People seem to think that if you talk really loudly by the elevators that no one else on the floor can hear you.  Well, I'm here to tell them that they are sadly mistaken in their delusions.  I wish all of you could be here to see the layout of the 2nd floor so I could prove my point.  So for now you'll just have to take my word for it.   I'm so glad the semester is coming to an end...Whew.
