BERMUDA CUP CHAMPS!!!  urlLink       > urlLink More Bermuda Pictures   Bermuda was absolutely amazing!! greatest trip ever...being on an island with friends is so much fun!!!I got to go horseback riding, snorkling, para sailing, and drive a scooter on the left side of the road around town.  boy was that weird.  then to top that we went 3-0 in the tournament and won the bermuda cup so that was awesome.. we go from barely winning any games all season to kicking butt...so cool!! a few bad things happened though; i got food poisoning and couldn't do anything but lay in bed throw up everything that was in my stomach so that was horrible but hey i lost weight...haha...then when i was snorkling me and two of my teamates swam into a jelly fish park like straight out of finding nemo and i got stung 5 times...i was the only one out of the 3 of us to get stung so that sucked then when we made it back to baltimore our battery on the car was dead so we had to wait for an hour for AAA to show up...thats what u get for flying on friday the 13th...but we still made it home and all in all the trip was amazing and i wanna go back!!!
