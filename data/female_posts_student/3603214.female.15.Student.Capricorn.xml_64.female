She didn't join in our pyroness surprisingly...Betsy's n Max's neice Samantha was trying to beat Max up. It was the funniest thing ever. He held her legs and arms and she tried to head-butt him. lol. I shoulda gotten a picture of it. Wow, she was hyper as hell...I think those were the only highlights of the night really. But Friday, I might be going to Betsy's to shoot off more fireworks w/ her n Steph.  So yea..I'm gonna b busy for the next week if I can get everything together...I have rehearsals tonight and next Tuesday-Thursday, the party on Saturday-Sunday, and I MIGHT be going over to Betsy's Friday, Tasha's on Sunday-Monday, n Mandy's Tuesday-Wednesday...OMG...how the hell am I going to do this?! HELP ME PLZ! I need to stop planning a kabillion things at once...But I can't really help it dudes...  I'm gonna put Jdawg's comment thing on my blog cuz I thought it was freakin hilarious: I'm going to make a point now, and comically at that: It's not important about whether or not people's lives are worse than yours, its about how your problem effects you. Say some kid loses a watermelon. Lets say this kid was very attached to his pet watermelon. He is soooo sad that he's lost his best friend. Then, he discovers his dad ATE HIS WATERMELON! HE ATE HIS BEST FRIEND!!! This character, whom we will call timmy, is absolutely traumatized by this turn of events. He cant sleep etc.  Now while timmy is probably the age of 5 or something, the important thing is that this is a big deal to him. I could be affecting him just as much emotionally as somebody that just lost a dog or a friend. Please be aware I am NOT saying you're 5 or anything. Anyway, I hope that helped. Now, lets have a moment of silence for timmy's watermelon...  it was supposed to make a point...o well lol
