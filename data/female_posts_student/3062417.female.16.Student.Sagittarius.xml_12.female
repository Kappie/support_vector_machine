But shhh don't tell him that because I don't want him to know how much control he still has over me.   I hate the feeling I feel when I think of how we aren't together anymore. It's like this empty, chill, choked-up, lump in the throat, gives you goose-bumps kinda feeling. Oh no, here I go again. More crying. I just can't help it. I love him so much and he doesn't feel the same way about me. It's completely impossible to get over him. I love him more and more every single day. The longer we are apart the more I know for sure that I truely love him.   People might say that I don't truely know what love is but they are wrong. I do. As I told Molly today:  Love is when a gun is held to a person's head and you would take the bullet for them.   Love is when you are without the person, you can't eat or sleep.   Love is when a smile comes to your face whenever you think of this person.    Love is when everything people say can be related to that certain person.   All of what I just said pertains to Gavin. Love is what I felt, still feel, and always will feel for Gavin. I can't help the way I feel, and I can't change the way he feels. I accept that. I just wish he felt the same as me. And I know that all I can do is wish. And that's what I will do, forever if I have to.   Noone can change how I feel so please, don't even try.    You think it's not hard to smile and laugh and put on a happy act for people every day? Well it is. Try it every day for a month and you will know how I feel. I feel like I'm dying inside and yet I smile and laugh for all my friends so they don't realize how much hurt and pain I'm in right now.  Song:  The colors have built up in my mind They're bleeding through my heart But nobody knows that they exist Look at my bursting veins Now do you see the red in me It's a sigh for the end Only the end of the red Will show you my blueside  I've been given my brush and plate Where will I paint my life And will the buyer in the sky Believe in what I dream It's so hard for me to explain What I will miss to myself Only the end of the red Will show you my blueside  -"Blueside"-Rooney  And with that, I'll go cause I'm sure you don't want to hear what I say anyways. I seriously doubt people read this anyways.
