But it's the dead of the nite again and I'm surfing on frenster for the umpteen times tonite, or rather for the past half a yr. I got no life!! HAha. I'm a internet addict. I'm exasperatingly ignorant to the basics of OS and MS but yet I revisit sites on the Web so frequent they shld just give me a membership man. Haha. Irony is in all walks of life and I'm one convincing walking creature on Earth to impersonate it!   My baby went home early today. Meow..sighz. Wish he wld cuddle me longer. Eh, wait he din even cuddle me today! Sobs. He came and watch soccer, ate dinner, played with Frizzy for a while and watch a bit of Discovery channel and he went off oto JB to pump petrol for the Ducarti. Oh well.. Maybe I'm such an emotionally demanding person I better keep track of myself.   It's so terribly boring man. I asked myself where was I at this time of the week for the past few years? Haha.. Nah, not goot to mention cos they usually involve clubbing at madam wongs( yea, that place is damn happening even on weekdays), la kopi with frens or meeting up with new people in irc or just out being pure scandalous or just chatting with new peeps on the net. COme to think of it. I no longer do all these now man...and that was like a yr ago where I was fervently pursueing these stuff.   Haven had a good nite's rest the past 5 days. Waking up several times and remembering switiching on my laptop everytime I wake up only to go back to slp once it's turned on, or I will surf for a while before zhou gong knocks his knuckles on my head to hurry back to dreamland to play chess with him. Man...talk abt cyber addict, I am no. 1 already. See the extend of my addiction to the internet even in the midst of my slp! Anyway, kept having weird dreams also. Had have them for quite sometimes but usually not in consecutive nites. But now it's more like routinous! Dreams of my baby and my ex bfs, of me being rejected, of me running ard in blocks of flats yadah yadah. Piangz..dunno what's going on in me man.   oh well.. I tink i better try to catch a couple of winks now. It's getting late and I dun wan my biological clock to get so screwed up again.. Till then peepz. Tataz
