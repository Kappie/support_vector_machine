Airy who have blogs. well..im hoping i'll dig up some kids at school and it would be fun to know all about them and how they think...well instead i get some guy named Chris Johnson, and the first thing that pops into my head is "pe coach at school!" haha because his name is chris johnson, but no, its some kid who is 21 and talks about how hes going for this job interview and all..but u know here hes working? AT MY UNCLES BUSINESS! haha okay, i find that amusing. of course its gonna be funny to hear about his work, considering its my families business. Oh the things u can discover. He has a thing about juggling..he likes to juggle. He even juggles in the shower...hmm or maybe he was jk but anyways im almost tempted to go to my uncles work one day, hunt him down and casually ask him if he likes to juggle. LMAO wouldnt that be funny? hey man, u like to juggle? haha and then bring up things. he'd flip. HOW DO U KNOW THAT? dude i read ur blog. LMAO ok..i so wont do that...haha but it would be funny. i wouldnt do it because he'd go search and then see mine. lol
