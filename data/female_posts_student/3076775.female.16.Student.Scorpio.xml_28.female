Well, I woke up at 9:30, and right after eating breakfast, started doing laundry. Talked on the phone for a few minutes, then started doing laundry again. Had lunch, then went outside and cleaned out the pool. I also pruned this big plant in my granny's flowerbed and push mowed half the front yard, as well as washed the car. Then I came back inside, and tried to call Nick in hopes that he would be able to go to Inky's ball game tonight. But lo and behold, he spent the night wtih a friend, which is fine. Ah well, at least he has friends to hang out with. Alotta my friends are guys, and I can't very well spend the night at their houses, that'd just be wrong. I'm sure me and you'll get to hang out some eventually this summer, darling. ^_^  After I called, my dad brought this Lincoln for me to test drive. It wasn't bad, just rather bulky and not so new. So, I had to go the store to buy newspapers and look in the classified section for used cars. In all honesty, I don't care anymore. After that, I started watching House of 1000 corpses. It was wierd! really wierd.. But then, Rob Zombie directed it, so I didn't really expect anything normal.  So, after that, it's off to the ballgame. 2 of em. They were okay. They won the first one, lost the second. So, then we went home, and here I am now.  Thursday me and Nick are supposed to play tennis,  if that doesn't get screwed up. Hopefully it won't.  I'm sorry about being such a pessimist lately. I'm just feeling kinda let down for some reason. Summer just isn't feeling like it usually does. I usually really like the summer, but now I wish school was back in session. Ah well, tootles yall! ^_^ Love, Shannon "In other words, please be true. In other words, I love you." --Frank Sinatra
