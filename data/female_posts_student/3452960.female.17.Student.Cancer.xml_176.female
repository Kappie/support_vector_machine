But...today I went to see Harry Potter with my friends Joe, Tim and Andy. I was yet again disappointed. It might be because I think the books are over-rated but meh. Ok, actually, I think it is the acting. God that Daniel Radcliffe can't act for his life. I have to say he has improved slightly but I still want to steal his big thickly-rimmed glasses and play Harry myself. It frustrates me! Also, the guy that plays Ron. I have to say he was pretty good in the first two films he over-acted at just the right time. But in this film he does it constantly.  The direction was better though, thanks to the new dude. He should re-do the first two films again that direction really did need improving. They should replace Harry potter too! The guy that plays Sirious Black was great though! in fact, fantastic! Maybe he jsut made everyone else look shit? Oh well.
