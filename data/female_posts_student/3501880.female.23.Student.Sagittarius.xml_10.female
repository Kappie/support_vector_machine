My therapy sessions seem to consist of me talking for an hour with my therapist just repeating back what I say to him in a slightly different way. I mean, I saw three different times today in my session, "I am not really sure what to do about X", which should prompt said therapist to say, "Well, I would suggest blah-de-blah-de-blah"...  Finally, I just finally had to say, "Can you give me some goddamn fucking solutions to my problem or are you just going to sit there like a gay fuck with your gay-ass gold necklace and make vaguely sexual motions with your fingers as you repeat back what I have said to you?" Okay, that's not what quite came out of my mouth, but I just wanted a direct fucking answer, and you know what his direct fucking answer was? "Here is a book that I recommend"...Surprisingly it was the Bible of Proper Telephone Time Management as recommended in our last session.   I hope to get a new therapist in the fall semester, cause this guy BLOWS hard!!!!!!
