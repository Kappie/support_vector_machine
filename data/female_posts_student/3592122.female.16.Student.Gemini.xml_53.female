It's not that I don't love you...I just can't trust... So I gained control... using endearment and lust. I cause you such pain and anguish, the same I protect myself from... Unknowing how anger has made me become. A little girl's trauma unleashed a mighty wrath... Into the body of a woman walking on a vengeful path. You've tasted my poison and fell under my spell... Cursed with deceit, when in love with me you fell.   written by: witchbladeXX
