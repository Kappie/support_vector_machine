I like John Edwards and all, but I swear, if he says "I'm from a small town in South Carolina,"  one more time , I'm going to be sick!  And Kerry. Oi. That man really needs some help with his speeches. I was listening to him, and wondering,  what the fuck  he was talking about. Get to the point already old chap! I don't have all day to sit around and listen to you! Sheesh.
