School was usual.  I went, I learned, I returned.  Nothing eventful, really.  Only one thing worth noting:  a group of us sang the national anthem at the local basketball tourney during 5th-6th period.  It was at the arena, and I rode there with Ellen, Shane, Mike J., and Lee.  We did an okay job at the song, though I don't quite like this version.  If you ask me why, I couldn't tell you.  Maybe it's the mere fact that DK is so prolific in choosing banner versions that I have become tired of learning them.  Ehhh well, it's late and I don't care to analyze my opinions.  *shrug*  On the way back to school, we stopped at the gas station to get frozen Cokes (mighty fine ones, I should note).  Overall, the outing was a refreshing and much-needed break from the daily grind.  Being a high school student yourself, I'm sure you can appreciate that.  After school was work.  I guess that's like saying after work, there was work.  I honestly do enjoy my job, though.  We were mondo busy tonight, so I was running rampant restocking the trash, wiping tables, and simultaneously sacking scrumptious snacks.  (Sorry, the alliteration bug bit me....I'm over it now.)  Anyway, a good time was had by all, and we managed to assemble all the orders correctly too!  When you're hot, you're hot.  *smile*  This weekend, a large chemistry worksheet and the infamous AP Lit and Comp project loom ominously over my head.  Lucky for me, my mommy graciously bought Power Point so I can finish my presentation at home.  I have to have it ready by Monday because I was the last person drawn to sign up.  *groan*  The Wonderful Amazing Luck of Katie strikes again.  Hardly.  *grumble*  Ehh, it will just push me to unprocrastinate, if that makes sense.  Being a high school student yourself, I'm sure you can appreciate that.
