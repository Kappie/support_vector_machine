1)  Bible verses:  I use the NIV translation ( urlLink huh?? ), almost exclusively. I like to utilize the online source  urlLink Bible Gateway , which, for anyone interested, has masses of different translations available. For the lessons, I should be linking to the sections the story references.  

2)  Curriculum and classes:   urlLink my church  has a program called  urlLink Sonday's Kids  for Sunday morning classes. The kids are placed in classes based on age from toddlers up through grade school. (There are separate groups  urlLink for junior and senior high .) The class I teach is for three year olds, and we're provided with a standard curriculum on a two-year rotation (which means that two years from now, I'll be doing the same lesson again). Each of my lessons has already been selected for me   (praise God!)   in terms of what passages I'll be teaching on. The rest of the class time is left up to the individual teacher. South Hills uses  urlLink Gospel Light  for the curriculum.  

3)  Inspiration:  everyone and everything around me! I get ideas from my Bible, prayer time, my husband, my relatives, my friends, nature, books from Christian bookstores, children I see in restaurants, and most definitely from other teachers!  

4)  Pictures:  Storage is courtesy of the wonderful  urlLink Photo Bucket , and picture sources are my digital camera, the web via  urlLink Google image searches , and... well, I think that's about it for pictures. :)  

5)  Anything else:  As I go along, I'll list whatever sources I've used for particular areas. :)   

If you're wondering about where I find anything I haven't mentioned, just  urlLink e-mail me  at havechosen at webmail dot diaryland dot com. (Sorry for not putting the exact e-mail directly on here, but I've got quite enough spam as it is, thank you!)
