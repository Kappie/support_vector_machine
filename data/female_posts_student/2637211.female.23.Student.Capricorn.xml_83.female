I was supposed to meet to study for a midterm this morning, but I totally slept through it. I should call the girl, but I'm feeling socially phobic and I don't wanna. So there.   This has been one of the first weekends I spent in Davis, apart from Jerm. It's kind of sad. I have a lot of fun spending time with him, and he really rejuvenates me. Hmm. He's so much my best friend, and phone calls aren't enough for me to really discuss our problems, and stuff.... Oh well, enough mushy stuff, I need to study for european history.
