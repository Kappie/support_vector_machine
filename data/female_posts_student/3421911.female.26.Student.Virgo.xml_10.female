I am, to a certain extent, capable of loyalty and fidelity.  There are just times when I cannot control my attraction for both the opposite and the same sex.  I like men, I admire men but right now, I cannot consider marrying anytime soon.  I like women, more specifically, women who look like men (I think to most people, the term is  “butch” ).  People might find it really strange that I am this way and a lot of them have come up with theories to rationalize my behavior.  Like, “ you must’ve had a terrible experience with a guy that’s why you dig chicks ”, or “ so, you like to experiment? ” or “ do you think you’re that ugly you can’t get a guy so you’d rather date a girl? ”  Oftentimes, they are wrong and I feel it stems out from their need to feel better about themselves.  Really.  I have been this way for a very long time now and that’s the way I am.  You either love me or hate me for it.  It’s actually pretty simple:  I have come to terms with the idea that I may never get married.  Not that no guy is good enough, there are a great number of eligible single men out there.  They just don’t like me.  I’m not good enough for them.  I got sick and tired of the whole idea of making yourself available and trying to improve yourself so that a guy will like you.  Like a guy will make the ultimate sacrifice for you.  It sounds very unfair, but it’s true.  Most men wouldn’t really make that kind of sacrifice for a woman unless something was in it for them, like sex or money. If a guy likes you for who you are, that would be great, really great.  But if he doesn’t, why should I kill myself trying to make him do?  Not that I won’t try or that I’m a wuss that I won’t even exert any amount of effort to improve myself  per se , not just to get a date.  I mean, I’m already fairly attractive(i have people other than my parents telling me so); I can sing fairly well;  I know when to use ‘ their ’, ‘ there ’ and ‘ they’re ’ in a sentence plus I study Philippine law.   I can  try to improve myself some more, but I won’t try to change me into something I’m not just so some schmuck can make me his maid after letting me drop my last name.  Besides, I don’t think that there is a guy ( tall, smart, talented, sweet, sensitive, fairly attractive, and considerably well-off ) in the planet that can handle me or my neurosis long enough to actually make a life-long commitment out of it. If there is, we haven't found each other yet.  I’m also open to the idea of living in with another girl.  Lesbians can’t really get legally married in the R.P.  following the provision in our Family Code ( Marriage is a special contract of permanent union between a man and a woman . . . ).  I want to have kids, yes, that’s why there is such a thing as artificial insemination, surrogacy and adoption.  In my last relationship, I had already figured out who my sperm donor would be, what their names would be and how to tell them what brought them into this world.  Sadly, that relationship ended and while I was badly bruised, I don’t really shun the idea of me dating another lesbian again.    Right now, there is a humongous effort on the part of the people around me to try to transform me into a girl, like the “only dating men” type.  I heard that there is even this bet on which guy will get to sleep with me first, if only to prove a point that I am a girl and that the relationship with my ex-girlfriend was only a phase.  Yeah, right.  Like they know everything about me.  I don’t really get referrals because people can’t exactly tell if they should refer me to a guy or to a girl.  But I keep my options open.  Whether it’s a guy or a girl, it doesn’t really matter to me as long as we understand each other and we enjoy each other’s company.  It’s just like the way heterosexuals try to find a partner: They don’t really care if the other person is rich or poor, cute or ugly, black or white, as long as they love the person.  I’m exactly that way only I don’t limit my horizons to the men.  There are a lot of cool women out there who think the same way as I do, I just haven’t found them yet.  Lesbians and gay men already have difficulty finding acceptance in this world, especially in this country, where nobody really wants to admit to being perverse but everybody makes other people’s business their business.  I can’t exactly make them understand my views too, considering they haven’t really come to terms with the concept of gay people in general. But I’m getting by.  Thank God, not all people are closed-minded.  Not everybody will hate you just because you’re different.  Actually, some guys even find it hot.  10 out of 10 men I asked actually like the idea of two women in bed together, but not two men.  Go figure.  It’s just hard to get a date again.  It’s hard to get people off your back for liking people from both sexes.  It’s hard to make them respect you for your views.  That’s why it’s hard to by.
