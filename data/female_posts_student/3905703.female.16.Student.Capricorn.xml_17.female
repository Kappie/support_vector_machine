And though right now I have no plans to go abroad for Grad., I just wanted to see the prospects and well, umm miss my Physics period.Of couse ,Prospects of sitting in A.C were also pretty alluring and I am not that big a pinhead as Karan seems to think to give up on it. Anyhow coming back to the presentation,  I must say they were pretty impressive. I mean passing themselves as the best university in U.S.A. without even blinking is something. Though I agree I do not have much info on foreign colleges, but I think it does not figure in the Ivy league.   The only thing which was good in their programme was the Co-op part which talked about working in Corporate Houses of America. And though she said that they give up to 20,000$ as scholarship, I havent seen anyone getting it last year.  Though the rains graced the city for the last 2 days, it hasnt poured today, not even mild showers, so I think N section should try singing Ghanan again (though without Mrs. Aditi Sarkar's guidance).
