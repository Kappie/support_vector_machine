Mostly the carwash involved holding signs and getting beeped at (ooh how fun!)or washing car after car after car.... yeah you get the idea. After the car wash I went with bethanne to west branch. That was fun and I got a tank top at rue 21 for only 4.99. I'm exausted and I think I'm going to go take a nap......
