I wonder how I've ignored them for so long there's a tear cascading down my cheek it's my offering to U but it will never be enough.  There's a scar along my face it's so easy to see that I've been broken and shoved back together  forced to go on without you and it's killing me  There's a shimmer of something Unnamed in my eyes there are words that cling to my lips words that I've never spoken until tonight.  "I need U..."  So as the sun descends  as the water stills I'll be awaiting your reply. though it might be too soon and it might be too late for U to hear me.
