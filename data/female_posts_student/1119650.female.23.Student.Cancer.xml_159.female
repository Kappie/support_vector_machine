I was surprised at how uncrowded it was there compared to last time I was there.  Oh and in exciting Ikea news they changed the kids menu!  No longer does your $1.99 get you a hot dog and french fries, but now you have your choice of that or some  Y U M M Y  mac  cheese.  Woo hoo!  There was some wierd stuff going on in there....this woman who was speaking either Italian or Portugese had her entire shopping cart filled with tea lights.  If you're even remotely familiar with Ikea, you know they sell about 200 tealights in a sack that will cost you about $3.00.  This woman had an entire shopping cart full of those bags of tealights.  I mean more than 10 bags.  Thats like over 2,000 tealights.  I appreciate that its a good deal, but c'mon, is there really a need for all those tealites?  Is there some hidden black market for tealites that I am unaware of?  If so how do I get in on this.  I wanna be the king pin of a tealite crime syndicate.  Anyhow aside from that there were these lil teenybopper girls who we couldn't get away from.  They were bracefaced and with their dad, well he was following them at a "cool" distance.  The worst part about them (aside from their mindless chit chat about the "uncool" kids at school and "OMG OMG OMG can you BELIVE her") was they weren't even shopping for the myriad of cool stuffs Ikea has, they were shopping for furniture...couches, kitchen tables, entertainment units.  At 13, who the fuck needs that?!?  Other than that it was magical and sad at the same time.  I found the nicest furniture I wanted, but I was broke as a joke when we got there.  Le sigh, le sigh...
