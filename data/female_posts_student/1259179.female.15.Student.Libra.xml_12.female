He confirmed that I need more surgery.  He basically wanted to admit me right away.  He was not very happy when I told him that I was not having him do the surgery but someone else near my home.  I guess he thinks I don't trust him...  Is he right !!!  Maybe....    Anyway, I have a appointment with a surgeon on May 6th and I am told that I am very lucky to have a date before the fall...  imaging that...  so I should have surgery around that time.  1 week in hospital and 3 to 5 weeks recovery at home but this time, no lifting NOTHING or NOONE for 6 months... Just in case.  Isn't that a great way to start the summer....  On the bright side, I have tickets to see Bruce Springsteen on April 19th.  I am going with my neighbor Mark.  His wife Lori(my friend) gave me to him for a night date.... hi hi hi   She is trusting and very pregnant.  Her dad even offered to drive us and pick us up...  how cool is that or is it becasue he doesn't trust us...  We are both Springsteen and Tom Jones fan...   Our spouses and the other neighbors think we are strange..  Well we are...  So on this, I promise feet massages to the girls so off I am to prepare the SPA.  Have a great evening and .........Be Good
