I've been in NYC, as well as on the beach at my cottage.    Things I have learned: - Pasty Irish and French girls shouldn't wear SPF 8 sun oil... Especially not pasty Irish-French girls (namely: me). - When attractive men introduce themselves, try to listen to their names and store them to avoid embarrassment later. -Look both ways before crossing. -When your best friend is about to start her period, it is not a good time to tell her that her ex is engaged. -Never disagree with a potential producer or buyer in the first meeting. -Don't meet someone as a writer while dressed like an actress.  They're think you're over-ambitiously trying to become a hyphenate.   Dress the part:  comic writers wear sneakers, other writers (usually men) wear loafers.  Neither wear stilleto sandals.   As most of you have noted, tomorrow is my birthday....  I'm much too young to be so anxious about birthdays.  If I were a smoker, that would be a different story.  Hehe...
