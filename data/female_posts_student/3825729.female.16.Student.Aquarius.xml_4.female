There's absolutely nothing going on today, I'm stuck at home, and it sucks.  Wanna at least drag my boyfriend over, but he's off somewhere.  Fuck.  I haven't seen him in a few days, I miss him.  I've just been hanging out with hot gay guys, which is fun.  Because they're hot. :p  But yeah... I'm tired and pissed off that no one's around who wants to do anything.  And I really want my boyfriend to stop being fucking OUT all the time... I miss him... *gripe*  'Sides, he has my yearbook still.  Gotta get that back.  Stupid Gabriel.  Oh well, I guess I'll live.  Should probably go have a shower now, but I can't be arsed.  Meh.  I just said I can't be arsed... *giggle*  Well, I'm off for a bit.
