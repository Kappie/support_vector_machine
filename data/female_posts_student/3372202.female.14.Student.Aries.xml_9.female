I made a 98 on my history test... you know, the one that you have to know all of the states and capitols, the great lakes, the major rivers, the oceans, and the surrounding countries. Yeah so i was excited. I am currently in a fight with someone and i will let them remain nameless- but if you have time you can listen to the whole story. We were riding our bikes and we decided to do this thing where we go really fast. So we did, and she (the person who is nameless) wanted to do it again. Anyway, i told her i didn't want to because my legs were all rubbery because they hadn't been exercised like that in a long time. She went off on me and she was like (ACTUAL QUOTE) "well just because you are lazy and out of shape..." (UNQUOTE) I was like (ACTUAL QUOTE) "excuse me?" (UNQUOTE)and i sped up and went ahead of her and when i got home i waited for her to come up the street so she could hear me slam the door. it sucked because now i am stuck hanging out with the neighborhood kids again... great... anyway, just thought i would post my bad day, along with the other eighty of them. comment on what you think i should do... should i apologize to her... talk to her and make her apologize... take a break from the friendship... you know whatever, it doesn't matter, just give me some feedback.  ---Sara
