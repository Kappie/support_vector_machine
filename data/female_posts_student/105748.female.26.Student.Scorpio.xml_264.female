I just talked to the main organizer of comPASs ( Committee for Pilipino American Studies). He gave me her agent's information so I could contact her. She has a new book out. It's a compiliation of her two poetry books, and it's published by City Lights (yes, of the Beat generation fame). I'll buy a book, and get it autographed for you, okay, Ching? Now, hush...;)   Now, I'm off to look for possible venues. Tah, tah...
