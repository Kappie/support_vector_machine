Anyway we finished school on saturday - and i spent most of sunday sleeping. This is the first time i have really thought of blogging! (yeah! me=dunce!) Anyway we had report reading on last thurs... mine went like this.  art - A English - B (only one - grrrr! messes up my straight As!) french - A* geography -A history -A* IT -A* latin - A maths- A music - A* (i topped the class!) RS - A biology - A* chemistry- A physics - A* spanish - A textiles- A food tech- A  That is 6 A*s! - i beat the 'cleverest' girl in my class! - it seems that she is not as clever as she is cracked up to be!... no names mentioned tho...!  well... my mum finally bothered to buy the spare part for my playstation... it really has depreciated in value in the past year - i got it for £110 with 8 games, now a console and controller cost £20 to buy :( - games cant cost any more than £2.50 each - oh well, it is MINE! lol  Anyways seems that there is nobody who reads this, so bb! hedge
