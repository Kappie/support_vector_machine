But if they have strawberry syrup then  OK  because strawberry syrup=the definition of ambrosia of the gods. I'll go if Abby goes, of course, so fill me in as it becomes appropriate.  I don't have a headboard! Har har har. I took it out a while back, so I don't think it's a problem. But if I did have one, it would be facing the door pretty much, so would that count?  OK, two slight yet very gay riddles. And Will, you can't answer, because you know. Let's see if ye gifteds can figure it out.   SO. There a guy who wants to get across a bridge that has a weight capacity of 245 lbs., and he weights 235. The only problem is, he's got three 5 pounds balls with him...of course, 235+15=250, and that's bad for him. So...the question is: how does he get them across? And by the way, he can't lose weight, cut off a limb, project the balls across the bridge, take another bridge, or use the boat, he has to have the balls with him when he crosses. How does he do it?   Someone asked me this one today and it took me forever to get it, but it came. And no major physics equations here, it really doesn't matter so much.  Woo!
