We both look stiff, but it looks great considering the photographer only took one shot. ;-)    I saw  What Women Want  in the theatres with Brian when it first came out. It was actually his idea. Looking back, I'm not so surprised that  urlLink TheSpark.com  guessed he was a woman. I really like it. It was pretty funny. We were actually contemplating on buying the DVD the last time we were at Hollywood Video. They're having a huge sale.     and then, um, well, you know...      We did some of that last night, too !   *giggles* It was make up for the other day. I was being really moody and grumpy (my only guess is that it was PMS, but it came kind of early). Everything was pissing me off. We were over at Brian's parents' house. We were sitting in our lawn chairs on the driveway watching the neighbors blow up fireworks. I was feeling neglected so I ignored him the rest of the evening.. But we made up already.  =)     By the way,  urlLink TheSpark.com  says that I am 33% gay: 2% gayer than average.
