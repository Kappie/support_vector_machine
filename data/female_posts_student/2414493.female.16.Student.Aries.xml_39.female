Just so you all know.  little mental list of things to do before school tomorrow morning:  shower spanish studying math hw (kind of)  some english that's not that bad, really oh yes, and pack a lunch  Little miscellaneous things happened today that I don't quite care to explain at this hour, i.e. buttons that don't stay. Busy day today, as usual: hospital volunteering (Betty, bless her, still calls me "Lily"), MT.   Yes, MT. They're cracking down, but I don't know if it'll be enough in time for competition. I hope it doesn't come down to losing a FINALS spot now by fractions of points. I haven't tasted that kind of failure yet, and I hope to God I won't have to any time soon. I just feel that everyone could improve. It means introspection and finding all the little weak points that need to be bolstered. Mental witness run-through: M, I think, still needs work in not looking so awfully dull, A needs to brighten up too. C needs more exaggeration. It's all about acting, people. I just wish there was some sort of gauge, a way to see quantitatively how much we suck. I know it's just not the right mentality, and I wish I wasn't that stupid to think that. We just need a good pep talk.  And because of major schedule conflicts, they're thinking of removing R next year. Serves him right, I guess...I won't say any more at this point except that I'm glad that I didn't have to miss too much this year. E's thinking of doing MT again, which will be a help.  Just MT on my mind. Obligations. What I wouldn't give for a good Baja Burrito right now.  I just need more faith.
