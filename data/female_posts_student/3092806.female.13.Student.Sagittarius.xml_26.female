I shouldn't feel terrible about any of this, yet I do. I mean, I made the right decision. Things will work out just fine, thanks to my actions... How, after one does something the correct and moral way, can feel a bit upset of their actions? I shouldn't being feeling guilty or upset by any of this. I should just be caring, considerate, and understanding of my best friend, Kate's, actions. However, I do feelresentment to it... I don't know, maybe I'm just being weird...    Alright, Kate, my nine year old BFF, has been chattingonline with this sick pervert who claims to be either thirteen or sixteen.(He's said both. Sad, huh?) Theymetin a Bacherlorette chat room over AIM.He AIMed her, asking for her ASL. She replied with that shewas ten years old and a female. (She'll be turning ten in a little while.) She didn't give him her location just because she didn'tfeel like it. Anyways, he responded that he was a male, sixteen years old, and lived in Tennessee. He told Kate that he loved her and she was wooed. They became online boyfriend and girlfriend right after that. As conversations issued over AIM between them hetold Kate disgusting, perverted things about his private parts. Kate asked him to stop several timesbut he just would not quit. Then, today, after a number of perverted sayings, she decided that it was the last straw for him. She threatened him that if he continued with this "gross" behavior on AIM that she would dump him. He pleaded with her desperately and eventually won her over. However, he did not stop with the remarks. She had to threaten him several times over and each time he played her like a fool. My twin sister and I watched this procedure. Finally, after he sent her an inappropriate picture of his male private part, I stepped in. I completely told him off. There was NO WAY in hell that he was who he said he was. I had heard about these type of people, they took advantage of children like Kate. I did not want Kate to become a victim. He had been playing with her mind the entire time, I just knew it. Even if he was who he said he was, I don't care... He deserved every word that he got. After breaking up with him and saying a few other choice words, I blocked him... This completely infuriated Kate. She yelled at me that she had wanted to do it in her own way at her own time. Though it may sound mean, I knew that she wouldn't have. In my heart, I know that I did the right thing. A potentional problem was issuing. He, I am quite sure of, would have wiggled personal information out of her eventually and used it to harm her and get what he wants from her. That just could NOT happen. So, I changed it. I know that it might have been stupid, but I did what I felt was right. Hopefully she'll never talk to him ever again and we'll never have to know what his real motives are.   I'm a little upset with myself at the moment. I didn't mean to make my friend angry at me but I didn't like the possibility that she could fall into a maybe evil man's clutches... Hopefully she won't stay angry at me for too long. I had my best interests at heart... Come on, you've got to give me something for that...   Let's journey to the brighter side, shall we? Well, really, it's not that much of a brighter side.Nicole's AIM account was broken onto by Kate's brother, my EBGF. This shocked my sister and I both because Nicole had just created that account... How could have he have known about it in the first place? Her password had seemed almost impossible to guess, too. Anyways, we changed her AIM password to something that would be hard to guess,a bunch of miscellaneousnumbers. Then we went to change her e-mail address account password, just in case he knew it and had the password sent to her address. It took forever to find the right thing to change it. Unfortunately we never got to change her password. Our e-mail thingy was updated and you currently can't change any of your accountinformation. That totally sucks...  Anyways, it's been a long day... Kate, Nicole, and I spent the night at Kate's grandmother's last night. It was loads of fun. Her grandma lives in the open country which, to me, is positively beautiful. One day, I want to live in the country.It was wonderful, being there. Her home sat atop thismagnificent hill. At the foot of the hill lay a tiny brook which wassurrounded by weeds, wildflowers, stones, plants, and other wild things of nature. To the east of her home lay green, empty fields that seemed to stretch on forforever. I'd love to go running through those fields...West of her house was a few trees that seperated her house from a corn field.To me, it would be greatfun, running through them when the corn was fully grown...Finally, behind her house were a few old barns, some trees, and a hay field.IfIlived there,whenever I got bored, I'd explorethem...Ah, it was wonderful. Her house, itself, was ancient. It was downtrodden but beautifully so. There were cracks in the walls and floors and no computer or any real technologybut it was fabulous all the same. Ah, what I'd give to live in the country.  Anyhow, I HAVE to be going... I've been on the computer for way too long...  Cya later...
