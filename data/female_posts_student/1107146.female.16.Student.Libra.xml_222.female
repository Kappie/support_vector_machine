It's all my fault too...eagh, sitting in the waiting room last week, I said to myself, "why's this happening to me? why can't this happen to someone else?"...and so now, of course, that I've said that, everyone around me is going to die, and I'm going to be the last one standing...is that all for the better?  Christ guys, I hope this week shapes up because thus far it sucks, just like last week and the week before.  EAGH.
