But yeh, let's not to back to the death of all things good and sacred if we can help it. And anyway, the operative word is "deleted", meaning "no longer able to be retrieved".  Booyah. And Chingy rox to the fourth my sox to the fifth, just to say that, not for any real reason.  And Linds...kudos, perro. I'm waiting for you to call back right now, and it's been about fifteen minutes and I wanna know right now, not tomorrow so I'm absotoutleloutely nucking futs waiting for the blasted phone to ring. Bleargh. I don't know how you would pronounce that, I just said it because I'm making filler sentences. I figure at some point here, karma is going to interfere with this post, and I'll type some key word and the phone will ring....yeah, the phone was supposed to ring when I typed that, but it didn't.   RAUGH, I HATE waiting for stuff, almost as much as losing and people being assholes other than myself.   Tick tick tick tick. Bleargh, again. NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW. I want to know, NOW! Je veux savoir, maintenent! Desidero ora sapere! Deseo ahora saber!   YAY!!! And then it rang, three languages later. And I heard some craaaazzy stuff. It was illin'.  Linds (and Abby will know as well, if she uses some mondo Schnooksums reading skills), I couldn't with my own! I mean, you just don't give the nuclear power plant operator's job to Janitor José. I am now going to conquer some Gardetto's and pretend like I'm king of the world for a minute, because that's about what it's going to take to make me believe any of this.   I'm still a firm believer that it all begins with one's self. Sure, you may have set down the fire, but I had to keep it burning. The more I say the more I dig the hole.  Keep in mind this post was a great euphemism; it isn't meant to be understood.  A Happy December Fools' Day to all. Now let's go and sleep it off.
