All three of these things are new to me. It feels kind of strange, indeed.  In-N-Out is doing a background check on me for the Customer Service department in Irvine. I will know in a week or so if they want to officially hire me. Keep your fingers crossed that the phelonies on my record won't foul things up. If all works out, I will also need to find residence in Irvine. I may have a room or two lined up...I will keep this updated.  I miss my friends. I want to drive again. I have contacted the DMV and they are sending a letter for me and my doctor to fill out. Hopefully, I will have my license back by September. That is my goal.  I am going to go watch LOTR, again!
