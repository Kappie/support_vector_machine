Im kinda sore from the 8 hours of physical activity that i pushed myself to participate in. Unfortunately i only heard one of Thursday's songs cuz i almost passed out... it was so hot. Texas for ya...  On the way there i was listening to a cd i made quite a few months ago, and realized all the songs i love are the songs that remind me of someone i hate to be reminded of. Not the person actually, but the situation we're currently in. Or the situation it seems we'll never leave, rather. Funny how cliches sometimes fit your life. "love hurts" dammit.  Aside from that, im looking for another job. Unfortunately im in Beaumont and left my applications at my dads in Nederland. Looks like i'll be dropping them off tomorrow instead of today. Lets hope that goes well.
