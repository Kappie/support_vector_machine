Anyways, I see this one called "Life at TJ's Place" I chuckled to myself, TJ's isn't that where Becca worked? I don't know, so I click it. So... TJ's is a STRIP JOINT and the guys is a DJ that works there. Yes, I am thinking "good ol' home cookin" and it's really " good ol' skank strippin". Well that's my luck for you.  Anyways, I went to work at the homeless shelter to help serve food tonight. We met at the Spaghetti Warehouse. Then Dr. Leahy is like "Get in my car, I'll drive you over there". There were 6 of us. Olivia and Rebey (Rebecca) get in and Libby and I were going to, and Leahy starts to drive away! AHH STOP COME BACK! So Lib sits in my lap (LIBBY I AM MENTIONING YOU, THEREFORE,  YOU READ MY BLOG !) and we start driving to the shelter. Leahy wants to turn around, and literally starts to make a U-y (u-turn) in the middle of the road WITH A CAR COMING! She sees it and yells, "CHRIST!" ooh it was so funny! Did you know Naus has a son who looks just like Harry Potter, well she does! And he came and they were both wearing khakis and a white polo. It was adorable! I love that woman! So then we served up some grub and it was a good time. Libs, Rebey, and I worked the milk table. But then this guy came over and was like, "What's the milk" I was really confused, he kept yelling it, and so I grabbed the milk and showed him. He didn't like it, cause it was Giant Eagle brand. Then we started talking about Big Bear and their good milk, I miss the bear. Anyways, I'm LITERALLY not studying. I just can't. I am emotionally DRAAAAAAAAAINED. I'll probably go read random people's blogs, cause I just don't care anymore. BYE!
