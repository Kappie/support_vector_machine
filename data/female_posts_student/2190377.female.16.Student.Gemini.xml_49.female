I bet you're wondering: So. How's life Ashleigh?  The answer is: I don't even think about it anymore.  My existence as a sentient being is over.  Except maybe now.  This spring break was pretty... uneventful, but not particularly bad.  I think my body has started a bad trend of getting sick over vacations, though.  Ickyickyicky.  My tummy still hurts.  I went to track on wednesday and thursday and almost vomited.  Howeeeever, I'm happy I went because now I can 4-step!! yaaay.  That means nothing to anyone and anyone it does mean anything to would know that it's not a kind of square dance OR anything to be cheering about really but I don't care because I PR'd in hurdles in gym shoes, with shin splints, two days in bed, and alien spawn growing in my tummy! After seeing Dawn of the Dead today I'm more likely to believe that it is not alien spawn, but, in fact a zombie baby.  Disgusting movie.  Oh how I loved it.  I think the defining moment of spring break was the conversation that took place in Jose's kitched at like 9 P.M. on Saturday.  I learned so much in an amazingly short period of time.  Did you know of the existence of the jeanis? geanus? geanis? not genus... I don't know how to spell it, but I will forever be paranoid of my jeans now.  Thank you so much Mr. Jesse Markowitz.  :) Man this entry is a downer.  Sorry.  Just picture my grandmother impersonating short black bootylicious women in her foyer.  bwahahhaa.  I'm so proud to related to her... kinda
