I told him I had emailed her a while ago, but she hadn't yet responded, and being that I figured that was for a good reason, I decided not to be persistent and let her get back to me when she could.  Then, to my surprise, today there was a letter from her in my mailbox!  It was so odd!!!  Anyhow, I sat down and wrote her a 5 page letter right then and there.  I was so glad to hear from her.  She moved back up into the Dallas area to be closer to her family because she had some medical problems.  Anyhow, she's doing better now.  She's living in Euless, TX in an apartment that she says is overpriced.. :-)  But she sounds like she's having a very good time being close to her family, and she's working at a pre-school.  Anyhow, she said she'd love for me to come visit... so I just may do that as soon as I'm done with finals..!  :-)  In the time buffer I have between end of long semester and getting a job and then starting summer classes.  We'll see... I also have to think about when I may be getting a visit from someone out of state... since there's a large possibility that will occur this summer... and my Mom couldn't be happier about that... haha  She's so funny!  Anyhow... I am LOVING my new room... it's like a breath of fresh air!  Well, that's all I have for now... I'll post more later once something happens that's worth posting... :-D
