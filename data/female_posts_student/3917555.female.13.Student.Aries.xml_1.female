Moving on to the next activity, Field Hockey camp, man tomorrow is the last day, and im really sad! This has been a blast this whole week!! We just worked on shuttles and weaves and stuff, then watched the bigger kids do a scrimmage and basically sat in the shade and talked about the game in general 'cause it was unbelievably  hot ... I thought I was gonna die!! Then the Rimol's dropped me off @ home..(felt good!) Then I ended up going over Jessi's house...we ate lunch and I watched her blow a kiss to her Orlando Bloom poster before we left for the pool..LoL! The pool was soo fun theres a big curly waterslide and a high diving board and then they dropped me off here! Jessi let me borrow the JoJo CD, so I loaded the whole things onto iTunes and now I just hhaavvee to buy it! hehe Happy Birthday mommy!!!  Mwaa! :-*   .:::*sam*:::.    ...he told me he loved me, he called me his breezy...   ~JoJo
