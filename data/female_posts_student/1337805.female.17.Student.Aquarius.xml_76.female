I was gonig to wear it to youth group, but now I find myself wondering where my sweats are. I don't want to be pretty. I'd trade it all in, for him. Sad? Yes. Maybe I should go, pretty up, just to show that I'm a big girl now. Hey Adam, guess we're both single now. Heh. Oh well. I'll live.  It was only a short lived thing, right? Why am I so upset. I wish I had some more friends online, to like, innterrogate him why....But I've vowed to stop that. Bring on your friends Lannie. I'm single again, and I need to fix that. Now.
