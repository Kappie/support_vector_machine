Whit got me a Brentwood Bruins afghan, which is completely cool, and my parents got me insurance, and a 5-disc cd changer for my room.  It's JVC, and it's the size of my dresser.  It's one of those 3-piece sets- it's got subwoofers and everything.  I just learned what that was today, so I'm using it as often as I can.  And then Abby brought me MINI MILANOS!!!  How cool is that?  She is so sweet...  All in all, this has pretty much been the best birthday ever, except for the whole psych paper.  And the thing at youth tonight, but that's another story that Abby can tell if she wants to.  And so, I'm going to go read the Scarlet Letter *cough sparknotes cough*  I can't help it- I'm lazy.    Oh, and Reiners got tickets to the Guster concert on Friday, so I'm going with him.  SWEET!!!  Hope Michael doesn't mind that one...Oops.  Oh well, it's not a date, so it doesn't count.  w00t!!!  GREAT birthday, all.  GREAT birthday.
