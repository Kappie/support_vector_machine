I was adamant that there wasn't going to be a third.But reluctantly, I agreed to go see the litter with him, and then reluctantly agreed to have Menchi in our home on the condition that my fiancee was the one to prepare for his arrival.    Folks, you can obviously see where this is leading can't you? I was the one who kitten proofed the house. There is a BIG difference between cat proof and kitten proof. Much of the groundwork had been done thank lord. Then there was a thorough clean of the house and then finally buying of another litter tray, kitten food, bedding etc. And yes, I did let my fiancee know that he was not my favourite person as I had spent my weekend preparing for the kitten  he  wanted.    When we broughtMenchi home and introduced him to Russell and Esper, it was obvious that this kitten was special. It was the fastest cat introduction on record. Russell sniffed and proceeded to lick Menchi. Esper had her nose put out of joint but 12 hours later was willing to tolerate his presence as she did us humans.    The photo is of Menchi the first night he entered his forever home. And for some reason he insisted on curling up to me, obviously he knew how to get into my heart and stay there.     urlLink
