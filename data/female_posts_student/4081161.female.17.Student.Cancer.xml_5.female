I searched the 'net for some ideas last night (ended up sleeping at two o'clock in the morning) but most of which were around sixty-dollars. Mmm.... I guess a well manufactured bag is a good investment ... right? I have about four hours and the entire Arden mall to accomplish my goal. Let's hope I have enough of patience and an iron tongue not to throw vulgar and creative comments at the slutty-looking consumers of today's brainwashing, capitalist media. My throat hardens whenever they walk past giggling and throwing about random words like "dude" and "Oh my GAWD!!" Uuuuggghhh.       Around two days ago I had my hair chopped off. Not all of it, but it was a good sized trim. It closely resembles the haircut I got the beginning of this summer, but shorter and more pixie-ish. Today I got my new glasses. I look like Uber-Girl Nerd 2000. Just saying the words  uber  and  2000  makes me a nerd even without the glasses. My nerd glasses and short hair makes me look like an effeminate Japanese guy with an oddly shaped chest. I have to try harder to make myself look more feminine, not like anyone cares, but then again what else shall I do with my hard-earned boredom?       Here's my  GAMINE GAMEPLAN  (catchy, no?):       Wear more lipstick.    Simple enough. I can wear the lipstick, it's just a matter of re-applying which I don't do that often enough because I don't bring a mirror around with me. Re-applying lipstick without a mirror means my lack of eye-hand coordination will kick in, and I will look like an absolute moron with lipstick all over my face, consequently with none on my lips where it's supposed to be.      Try not to tell sick jokes as much, if ever.  No more sick jokes, Cristie. My vocabulary and inflection should be that of a good ole Christian gal, not a drunken sailor on crack. No more hanging around demented people with limited vocabulary. For some reason, I feel as though I should not hang around people who welcome hygiene as much as a broken leg. Poor hygiene is a factor that quite possibly affects their verbal deficiency. So if you want to be my friend, please consider using soap once a while. Maybe all the time.     Hang out with girls more.  This is hard. It's not because I don't hang out with girls. I  do  hang out with female companions, but they're not really the type who discuss make-up and boys and whatever it is that females discuss nowadays. It's just that I need some positive, floral scented influences rubbing off on me. I need someone to chagrin me every time I do tell a sick joke. I need someone to compliment my clothing and teach me how to giggle. And no I don't giggle, I  cackle . There's a significant difference.     Accentuate chesticles and other womanly features with skirts.  After/if I get married and have kids, I will not have this curvaceous body that I am now blessed with (I know you're snickering... stop snickering). I will have gained weight that will be a pain to work off, and my chesticles will be sagging and my hips will span the entire state of Rhode Island. I am seventeen. I am at the blossoming zenith of womanhood. TIME TO SHOW IT OFF.      Stop swearing.  Actually this has nothing to do with being feminate, but I have to do this anyway. There's nothing more unattractive about a lady than having to add asterisks after the first letters of two particular four-lettered word if ever it's being transfering to paper. Granted I  do  know how to exhibit creative insults without profanity, but nevertheless I must harness the profanity when it tries to take hold of my tongue. It will be as hard as  shizzny winkettes , but I must try.     Enough of the subject. I will be the primary informant if my little experiment works.       Today was not too exciting. For one, I had to wake up. That always ruins my day. I don't remember much besides the searing 103 degree heat. My aunt, my four cousins, my mom and I went to William Land Park for the Annual City Employee Picnic. We got eight free tickets from Mr. Coons because he works for the City planning and creating traffic signs and such. We started off for the park about two, ate something, went around the park with our free bonus passes. We had free entry to the Sac Zoo and Fairy Tale Town. Again, still fuzzy on the details. I vaguely remember seeing oddities like the sun but otherwise I felt like I was walking around with a bag on my head.       Random thoughts: Send two letters by tomorrow.... Tomorrow is Friday, right? ... When does the bloody Olympics start? .... School registration is next Tuesday.... I'll bet no one will recognize me.... Mom needs help to get a digital video camera... Ecstatic... MUSE IS SO AWESOME...       Okay, I'm done.   = Cristie
