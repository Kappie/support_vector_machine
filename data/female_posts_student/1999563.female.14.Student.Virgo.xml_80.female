Right before the best weekend of my life too.... :P  Here is what is happening Thursday Superchick- ALL day. I better not be sick. Friday Rowing and "Harvest Dance" :P Saturday Rowing Regatta- we have to be there at 6 AM. If I am sick I will die.  Then church from 4:30-8:30 Sunday Katies confirmation and party! Yay!    If I am sick I don't know what I will do.... *sigh*
