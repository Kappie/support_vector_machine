I got to talk to max today!!! YAY!!! That made my day!!! Not that it was the longest talk but it was still nice... its nice to be able to talk to him while hes gone... he said he misses me... and he even emailed me... I hope he will email me tomorrow while I'm gone because if he comes online I wont be around... because I'm going sailing!!! YAY!!! But anyways he told me to rent this movie called Donnie Darko... so I guess this weekend when I am bored out of my mind I will rent it and hopefully it will make me happy... Not that I really have time to be bored because tomorrow I am gone all day and saturday I am "going shopping" at like 5:30pm so I guess that morning and then Sunday I have to pack to come home and then go back home and clean my house before Sumathy gets here... It is the most I've  had  to do since summer started... I also have to call my Aunt Angie and plan a day to go birthday shopping and I have to call the salon and find out how much it will cost to get my hair 'did' and then get an appointment... AHHH so much to do... but it will all be fun...   Veronica's is going to be a blast!!! I cant wait... Mandy is going to come with me and I did invite Chad and Britt but according to Max, Chad is going out of town and Britt cant because she has to work early saturday morning and its her first day back... But I am sure it will still be fun and Chadd will be happy that Amanda is coming!! haha... we have proof, sucker!!!    Anyways the rest of today was good... I went to dad's and then we went shopping for Brittany's present and then I called Mandy and she came over and she came back to mom's with me for awhile... It was fun even if we didnt really do anything other than talk smack and read magazines....   Well I have to go now... I have to get up really early tomorrow morning, like 9:00am because I have to shower and pack and then go shopping for snacks and then we have to meet in Fond du Lac at 11:00am... It will be so much fun... even if I get sick... haha... well I am still excited I will try to update soon...   nighty night   -gabby
