But some people eat all the marshmallows first then eat the cereal. And some really weird people just eat it all at once.  I need all of your data!  You can post it in the comment box! :)  Since some of you may not know what I do I shall give the definitions of things in my life:  CAM: Character Achademics Marketplace High School. That is the weirdest name for a school I have ever heard! It doesn't even make sense!!! *sigh* CAM..what will I do with that place. CYT: Christian Youth Theatre. Its the theatre I do and its qutie quite fun! They have three shows every year and you have to tryout to get in. For the tryouts you have to sing a solo. Its always really scary for me because I can't sing very well! Improv: Every year there is a CYT Improv Competition in San Diego. You can to take an improv class then they choose the top 5 people from the class to compete. This year I was chosen so I have rehersals every week. On July first we are going to San Diego. *w00t* New Hieghts: The church I go to. Its SO huge. 6,000 people go there! I just started going about a year and a half ago, I like it very much.   Well, I can't think of anything else to explain, but if you don't get something I say, just ask!!
