Take my story: We were putting out irrigation pipe last friday when i was struck in the back of the leg by the tire of the pipe trailer. Well the tire grabbed my leg and wouldn't let go, in which it bent my foot pretty much around the tire, backwards. Well ya see I excercised some restraint...and didn't cuss, seriously, all i said was ouch crap. Then my mom remover my shoe and cut off my sock, by then the foot was starting to swell, they took me to the emergency room in sturgis, the guy nurse was hot....neway, they told me that it wasn't broken, just that i pulled everything in the top of my foot, well shit, there goes my summer, and my volleyball season.
