I love Nirvana and Incubus. I do hate homework though, but I guess that's what you get for missing school. yuck. remind me to never dissect anything that was living again. it was disgusting. I hate eyeballs. I really really do. ho hum...nothing exciting happens in my life. it is all sad or boring. I wish I was going to Maple Ridge. I love Mest also. I hate running without a reason. lol Into [my puppy dawg] is playing with a giant orange easter egg...he is soo cute...even though he is big, and smells bad. just like formaldehyde....*shudder* gaar...I like to growl. I hate socials.  I am going to walk down to the beach today and watch the sunset. I thi nkI will try to do that, I will make it my daily activity, maybe it will give me some peace....
