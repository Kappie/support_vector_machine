They had us all do a  urlLink Myers-Briggs  type test at work. I did it like a trooper, but I'm wondering about its usefulness to management. It also seems really intrusive for an employer to make you do a personality test. Employers shouldn't be doing psych testing, even hokey internet psych tests.    The test said:   Your Type is  ENTJ  Extroverted Intuitive Thinking Judging  Strength of the preferences %  78 22 22 33    Evidently, this makes me a Fieldmarshal. Or something.   I'm pretty  urlLink dubious  about this. What doesthat scoretell my employer? How would it help my co-workers work with me? I'm not really convinced that the Myers-Briggs model is terribly useful even to me, much less my employer.  Field Marshal, huh? I wonder where I can get myself the uniform.
