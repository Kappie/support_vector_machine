The state that I live in just so happens to have one of the hardest driving tests known to man(besides IOWA, their driving test could be considered in some states as a form of chinese torture.). Questions were asked that someone of uber genius couldn't even answer. I was shaking in my boots(which were actually shoes) by the time we hit the door and my stomach was tick-tack-throw up.    It was an overcasted day...  suggesting emminent doom. I was ready. They lady behind the desk called our number and my mother and I were up in a flash. "Got your packet?", she says. "Yes- we have the package.. I mean, the packet.", I reply. The lady behind the desk points, and we're off to the testing center. I'm asked a serious of questions like, "Do you have a drivers license in any other state" and, " Do you have any outstanding tickets that you can be taken to court over." After these questions came the vision test, where the text applicator found out that I, Meghan, could not distinguish my left from my right. "I'm a little nervous" I told her. "It shows", she replyed. I was then directed towards a big computer that had the number 1 scrolling this way and that. The test pops up and I am feeling less than confident. By the 5th missed question it was apparent to me that I WASN'T READY! I begin to daydream that I'm drowning in traffic signs and DUI charges. I begin to take proactionary measurements, skip the hard ones to leave until later. With this method I sucessfully passed with a 78%. Thats a percent above lowest passing grade.    Gulp  That was more than riveting. But now its over, and all I can do is retell my story in this lovely blog.
