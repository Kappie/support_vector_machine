Yes, I suppose that we should give them some slack because they're from another country and aren't used to the ways of Americans, but some things should go down in history!  One woman has lived here with her husband for 7 years and still cannot speak English, I've seen an Englishman invite..and was serious...a friend of mine to go to Europe and travel for a couple of months...maybe or maybe not to return.  Then there's the German who's into S I've been told...and the Argentina guys who get so drunk they jump up and down singing the strangest spanish music to each other!!  To go along with the 'out of towners' there are the people  here .  I've seen a registered pedifile walking the streets as a group of young men throw firecrackers at him, a lady who for some reason walks around with foil on her head pushing a grocery basket...(the ol' timers say she's afraid aleins will get her!!)...and then there's the girl who comes into the bar to play the jukebox and dance in front of the mirror by herself.  Oof course there are the hobos that fall off the train everyday like clockwork and the lady (whom everyone claims to be extremly wealthy) that rides around on a donkey and sleeps underneath a tarp on the side of the road.  Yes, I've seen her!  There are farm animals and wildlife that roam the streets night and day.  A place  on the main street houses two roosters in a cage as if she's trying to decorate her lawn, herds of deer run through downtown Alpine during hunting season...I've even seen a huge buck walking around our neighborhood with christmas lights stuck in his antlers.  And then there's the goat story...and I think that the goat wasn't enough for these people, because now there's a rabbit in the backyard for the dog to play with and a rooster whose crow has a crack in it and it sounds liek when Robbi trys to play her violin!!!  I've also not seen a town with so much law enforcement either....Border Patrol, Sheriff, City Police, DEA, Customs, DPS...and Alpine crawls with TABC officers.  All of this to say, there are nice normal citizens out there, but who wants to talk about the normal people?  I mean, not only is our town full of alcoholics and drunk college students, but strange people too!  As I've said before, there's never a dull moment around here!  It's great!     Lisa
