I believe Pia watched it on the same weekend.  By the way, are any of you still keeping up your blogs?  If so, please sound off with the link.  It just dawned on me that when we changed the site layout I forgot to add everyone else's links back on and I don't have all of the info any more.  Please also list the sites that you visit so we can add those to the links.
