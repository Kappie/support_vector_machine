My life has become consumed with neopets, that really stupid game i used to play in the fifth grade. there is something about it... maybe i feel more independent handling my own "money" and getting "money" from playing "games", i mean games. i don't know. i've been very lazy lately, not very happy about that. my room = inhabitable. i sleep there, and wash my face and brush my teeth and get dressed. and i never go in for the rest of the day. i have to read a book for history class still, and i have to finish writing in my yoga journal.  we watched the emperors club today, and again, it made me all teary eyed. it really is a good movie. iiiii have to go. i have that whole packing thing... oh wait, no school tomorrow... i don't have to pack until tomorrow! HA HA! well i have to go do not neopets. Julia
