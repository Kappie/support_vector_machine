Mrs. Connelly was supposed to be there, but she couldn't come because she had to plan something for a funeral or something...but anyway, it was fun. We were all talking about everything a laughing and making fun of people. And we got a lot of fried ice cream! It was good stuff too. Oh, and of course we made fun of how Ken eats with his pinkies out...that was quite funny.   After that LeeAnne and I went and wandered around Wal-Mart for a while, I mean after all, Wal-Mart is THE hang out place. *cough* Yes, I know it's sad. So we were there for a while looking at CDs, DVDs, and the craft section to see if we were inspired by anything. She ended up buying these little cloth sack things. So after that we came back to my house and we decorated the cloth sacks with (Sorry...I just had a quick interuption with myself...."Hey Dude" is on Nickelodeon right now!!! Remember that show?!?! It used to be on all the time. IT'S ON RIGHT NOW!! How sweet?!) anyway....we decorated the sacks with some fabric paint (after we found the paint amid all our craft stuff in the basement) and we watched "Sleepy Hollow." Then she left and I went to bed around midnight.  ****FIRST OFFICIAL DAY OF SUMMER****  Yep, that's today!! So I didn't get to sleep in as late as I would've liked, but later than I have all week. I woke up though around 7:00 because I'm so used to getting up early, but I fell back asleep until my alarm went off @ 9:00. So I got up, ate breakfast, took a shower, did my hair, etc. And Wanda and the Mosemans showed up and we left to go to Medina. We stopped at the movie theater and bought tickets for "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" and then we went to Fazoli's for lunch. It was really good...anyway, we stopped at Marc's to get a snack for the movie theater (only 83 cents compared to $2.50...yesssss....) So then we went to the theater and saw the movie.   MY OFFICIAL REVIEW OF THE HARRY POTTER MOVIE:  Okay it was awesome. The scenery was amazing at the school. There was a lot more outdoor scenes, which I really liked. There was also a lot more humor in this movie compared to the other two, which I also really really liked. One example, Harry is studying late in his bed in their dorm when Ron wakes up and Ron says, "The spiders...they're trying to make me tap-dance. But I don't want to tap-dance!!" And Harry says, "You tell 'em, Ron." And Ron goes, "Okay...." and lies back down. Funny stuff. Also in this movie, I thought the characters seemed more realistic, like normal kids. It's kind've hard to explain, but when you see the movie, you'll understand. I really liked Buckbeak in the movie, he was really cool. The scene where Harry is flying on Buckbeak is really cool. And then there are the dementors...  they were really quite creepy. The scene where they first are on the train was really scary actually. It was cool though. And the time turner part was really cool, too.  My only complaints: I did not like that they didn't have the Quidditch Cup in the movie. That was a great part in the book, and I wish they would've included it in the movie. Also, they didn't explain who made the Maurader's Map, which I found somewhat disappointing. And I didn't like Professor Lupin as much in the movie as I did in the book.  But I guess that's why the book is always better. But overall, I believe this movie is my favorite so far!!  Well tonight, I have one graduation party to go to (Leanne Wilson's). Holly and I are going together, she's picking me up @ 7:30 and we're heading over. So that is all for now. I highly recommend you see the third Harry Potter movie because if you don't, you're missing out on a real treat.   Oh and from the place we went, we got a little lego thing to build the Knight Bus. How cool is that?! =)   Just keep smilin'!
