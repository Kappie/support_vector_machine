In one respect, I had a couple of great debates with one of my friends, who I cannot seem to convince that the United States owes the rest of the world something for being the world's only superpower, and that as the world is ever shrinking, we, along with the rest of the world, will benefit from our foreign policy decisions of late, fraught with mistakes though it may be. I think we have a great mandate, as well as a great responsibility, after September 11, to do something, to do everything that we can to make the world a better place, including freeing the Iraqis from Saddam. My friend thinks that since none of it impacts him directly (in one of his weaker arguments, he said "the terrorists didn't fly planes into me") and because there are so many problems at home that need our attention that we shouldn't be sticking our nose in where it doesn't belong and trying to solve the rest of the world's problems. I disagree with his premise because there is no reason that we can't do both, and it means less to me that I have government provided health care when I know that things are so much worse for nearly everyone else in the world. That, to me, is the real American arrogance, and I think the rest of the world is right to reprimand us when we are slow to take action. Still, this argument is better than Michael Moore's the-war-is-all-about-oil mantra, but I'll save that for another day, since I want to present all my thoughts on his film in one place, and here is not that place.  But just when I think I've found a place to fit in, I am surprised yet again. A friend of mine - who has apparently been captured by the religious right and held hostage - sent me an unsolicited email the other day trying to recruit me into the fight against gay marriage. It surprised me, and I don't quite know how I am going to respond to it yet. Now my parents are mad at me because I did not want to go to church, because I didn't want to run into her. I was afraid I couldn't help but respond with my disgust, and I didn't think church was the place to carry that out. But I do feel disgust. Not at her - or anyone elses - opposition to gay marriage. I think reasonable minds can differ. I do object to the rhetoric of the relgious right, though. These people should pay more mind to the tenets of their religion, which teaches them that we are all God's children and that it is not for us to judge here on earth, but for God to judge us on how we lived our lives once we are through with this world. I also object to the perversion of conservative principles that is embodied in this ridiculous attempt of Congress to continue dealing with this issue, when it is something that should more appropriately be dealt with by the states, not the federal government or, even worse, the United States Constitution.  All in all, it's been a frustrating couple of days for me. Still, it's nice to be home, and it's even nice to have a little debate or two, keeps the brain from shutting down. And my sister's engagement party yesterday was a big success, I think, though I haven't gotten the chance to spend very much time with her fiance yet. And her kittens are very cute, and no longer occupying my room.   So, it's the little things.
