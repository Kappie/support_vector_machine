So now I have to bust my butt to get back to my former shape, and I really need to start to eat healthy, but I think I'll start that tomorrow.... Oh but some good news is that the cable is finally working again!! Saturday morning when we were getting our landscaping redone they cut the cable line and so I was doing this thing called reading, yeah so instead of watching the olympics on the tv, i read about them in the newspaper... i think my vocabular is expanding because of it. But yeah, i think i want to marry michael phelps--such a nice body and he's really tall which is always a plus and he's athletic and probably has got some extra cash... sounds like the perfect husband to me... oh and I'm sure he has a great personality....'""""'cleesh cleesh"''''" I'm out`'`'
