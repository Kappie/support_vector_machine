Someone should come visit me, doubtful that will happen,...everything is doing stuff and I'm too far.      Have you seen that Asprin commerical? Fuck I want to shoot the tv.      I'll probably end up posting later. First I think I'm going to use Wish and Gus as my shoulders so I can get this stuff off my chest.      Oh yeah, YR is on soon too. BUT Passions is on right now.
