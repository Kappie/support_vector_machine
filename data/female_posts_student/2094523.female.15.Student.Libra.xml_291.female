Now its different.. now i have 3 different plans i said maybe to, cept i dont even want to go anywhere, i dont want to do anything, i just want to go home. Im just so boring now, the world keeps spinning, the days havent changed, but im lounging aroudn wanting to be somewhere else, a place where i can enjoy myself. coz right now.. everythign smacks you in the face it leaves u weak and all u want to do is go hoem crawl into bed and sleep the day away.
