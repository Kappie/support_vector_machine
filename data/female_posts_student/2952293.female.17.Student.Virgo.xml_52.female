Madeline goes on and on about her favorite ice cream, she had so much to tell, Heywood was like, "You should just write an essay on that!" It was so funny! Everybody had these really good dishes, and then it was Allison Elia's turn and she goes, "Um.. mine comes from a box!" It was just so funny! When we were getting ready for flag football, Ann threw something at my head. I didn't even try and block it, it just smacked me in the middle of my face, oh yeah and by the way it was a pad. I am really bad at football, but I did catch the ball twice, it was exciting. We watched  The Emperor's Club  7th and 8th to prepare for our upcoming exciting discussions of honor. EC sat next to me, we laughed a lot. Then she goes, "I don't like my brown kids white-washed!" It was sooo funny! D Pak is so hot. Well that's about it. P.S. Thanks to Trisha for reading my entire blog entry from the weekend, I know it was hard to read it all.... thanks buddy!
