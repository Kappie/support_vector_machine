I had a wonderful smile from ear to ear. When I saw this picture I instantly remember a picture I had seen of Jesse when he was little. I quickly ran into my room and reached for a small golden colored cardboard box. Inside it there were tons of pictures from Jesse’s past (one of the few things his mom ever gave me that I adore). “Where is it?” I said to myself as I dug through picture filled box. “Ah Ha!” I took a picture out of the box. It was of a little red headed boy sitting on a bail of hay and right next to him was a large pumpkin. I ran into the other room and I showed it to my mom. She thought it was too cute. We think that Jesse was about the same age as me in the picture too.
