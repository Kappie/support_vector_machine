On Friday, there was a pep assembly and because I'm too cool for those (actually, my friends are too cool for those... i wanted to go! but apparently it sucked anyway) I stayed in the cafeteria. The pep assembly would have been preferable as I had to be in the same room as Andy, who I had decided never to talk to again for undisclosed reasons. But anyway, yeah Charlotte was sick so our plans were out to all go see the UW's production of Sweeny Todd, but I was going anyway because my mom and sister wanted to see it. Josh came too; we decided that at least we should see it, cause then everyone else could go with Charlotte (did you ever go, Char??? :(   ). It was the best production I've ever seen. It was soo awesome. Disturbing, but awesome. I think it closes tonight... otherwise I would tell you to go see it.  Yesterday I had a life drawing class at the Frye in Seattle; which if you didn't know life drawing means drawing naked people. Weee. I got some good stuff in I guess. I was fine when it was just the one woman, but then much to my dismay the gangly middle-aged man who I had assumed was a teacher's assistant actually turned out to be a model too. Hahaha... yeah. The class was 6 hours long (!) but it actually seemed shorter. There were only 7 people. After the class, me and Josh saw Elf (the second time for me sadly) and went to Barnes  Nobles to find Josh more of his gay-boy smut books (heh..jk love ya Fruit-pie!) and I got my mom a Beatles book (okay so I wanted it too...). Haha it was funny, we were trying to find his gay-boy books in the Relationship and Sexuality section, with me loudly saying repeatedly JOSH I DON'T SEE ANY HOMOSEXUAL BOOKS... heh. We got home without crashing or legal trouble (always a plus) and then proceeded to entertain Josh's buzzed parents and friends... it ended in a all-out guerilla warfare fight with towel whipping, and I got out alive. Lol. Today I had my class again, getting bored of drawing naked people... at the lunch break, at a weak moment, I walked to the McDonalds, which actually ended up being cool because I ended up eating with a guy in the class (1 of 2 lol), see no one in the whole class like talked at all the whole time so I was glad to finally talk to someone lol. He was cool, I gave him my number. Now I'm going out to eat and go Christmas shopping. I've been home like 3 hours besides sleeping this weekend. Bye~
