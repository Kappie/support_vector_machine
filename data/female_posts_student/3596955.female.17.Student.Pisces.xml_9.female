The Plot  After being brusquely snapped at, the emergence of Sam the sadistic character, who incessantly assults his wife, I, to the extremity that I undergo a prolonging degree of 'battered wife syndrome.' Yet with the involvement of a sweet, little child, James, the current stance is somewhat atypical than what it seems.  The Scenario  After much conflict, both internal  external, I am reduced to bestowing James to Child State Services. However, as insecure as I am, I decide to bear the violence  condemnation, the vehement Sam persists to inflict upon me.  The Question  Why so violent?   The Answer  I cheated on Sam...with Will Smith.  The Twist  Why is James still white?  The End.  hahahahahahah you like ;)? Wait til we introduce the personality of Andrews, who possesses a secret. That his dog only knows of. Hrmm  The complexitities of such soap operas! Intriguing indeed. hehehe =) Another glorious day!
