They found a website that had a picture of the ever-elusive "used panty" vending machines of Japan.    And I'm just not sure how I feel about that.  I'm all for technology, for giving people whatever they're willing to pay for.  I don't think people should be allowed to sue tobacco companies or the like just, because if you pay for it, you consent to whatever goes along with it--people gotta take responsibility for that stuff and stop shirking it.  Back to my point, though, which is I'm not sure if selling supposedly "used" panties, which we are given to understand are little girls' panties, is really conducive to encouraging healthy sexual behavior.  OK, now I'm entering into the modesty debate...  Sex is good, and sex between consenting adults (and I agree that teenagers can easily be considered 'consenting adults') is good.  Domination, well, that's a bit of a grey-area for me.  See, I can handle someone going to someone else, looking to be dominated, but to force someone else into submission, that's not ok.  So I think that pretty much establishes my thoughts on the subject.  I don't think that a vending machine that sells the worn undergarments of children, of young girls, is hocking a responsible commodity.  I mean, who buys that kind of thing?  The answer that springs immediately to my mind is "PERVERTS".  Yeah, child-molesters, rapists, whatever.  Kids and sex should be separate.  In fact, if there is a supplier to sex, that supplier should be consensual.  For example, porn stars know what's going to happen to their image, how it's going to be distributed, etc, so that's ok.  Girl's that get stalked and have weirdos rifling through their trash to feed their sick little fantasies, I think it's pretty safe to say that's NOT ok. Get me?  You picking up what I'm putting down?
