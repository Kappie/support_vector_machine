Yet, despite its obvious benefits, a formal education is  not universally accessible   to every child, every man, every woman . No,  education has been and remains a luxury , a luxury often unattainable for those occupying disadvantaged stations in life.          The total number of people in the world 15 years and over who are illiterate was  over 885 million  in 1995. This figure representated  22.6  percent of the worldwide population, or more than  one in five people . Out of the 885 million, 320 million were male while 565 million were female. In other words, 16.4 percent of the world's male population are illiterate while 28.8 percent of the world's female population are illiterate. Fortunately, recent studies are showing that the gender gap is gradually closing.             Over 130 million children , mostly girls, have  no access to education  on the primary school level. In developing countries, 25% of all children entering schools are expected to drop out before completing a primary education.          The difference in literacy rates between the developed countries and the undeveloped countries are quite dramatic to say the least. Overall, only 1.3 percent of the population in the most developed countries are illiterate while  51.2  percent, or  over half of the general population in the least developed countries could not read or write.           In general, the level of education in the world has been  rising  in the past twenty years. However, an enormous disparity still exists between the rich and poor. Take the United State as an example. In 1969, only 69 percent of the total American adult population had completed high school and the percentage of people seeking higher education via a four-year college degree was only 17%. In 1997, over 82 percent of the adult population in the United States had completed high school and the percentage with a college degree had risen to 24 percent.          A country on the opposite end of the wealth spectrum is Ethiopia. In 1970, the gross enrollment ratio had been only  0.2 percent . Almost thirty years later, the enrollment stands at 0.7 percent, a gain of only 0.5 percent (in the absolute sense) over three decades. With little money to spend on educational expenditures such as more teachers and supplies (i.e. pencils),  poverty and the lack of education conspire to become a vicious cycle  in which a child is born in poverty, receives  no access to adequate education  and as a result,  can not acquire the skills they need to break out of poverty  as an adult - thereby starting a new iteration of the cycle with the next generation.          A good educational environment must be free from danger. Yet, crime and violence seems to h ave slowly infiltrated schools everywhere. According to recent studies, up to 10 percent of 1992 American high school seniors reported that they did not feel safe at school and over 23% reported school  fights between different ethnic/racial groups . With the recent  wave of school shootings , student confidence in the safety of the educational environment are at a  low point .             Education is one of the most important keys to the success of humanity  as we march into the new millennium. Our goal should be a world where everyone, even the most disadvantaged, receive adequate education to prepare them for a productive life.
