My classes are almost two hrs. long and back to back, it takes all day and breakfast is bright and early and lunch is only served if you get there on time, or you have to wait for the next course.  I have had to stay up late and study every night after exhausting days.  This is not an easy way to do it.  It is taking so much more effort than even school at home.  I was supposed to have read 75 pgs last night for just Debtor Creditor alone, then I had Immigration too.  I don´t have time to do anything and I am so worn by midday that I have to resist naps by not allowing myself in the physical bldg of the hotel, or then I nap and don´t sleep at night.  I actually haven´t slept for two nights now, except about 4 hrs last night, which for me is not enough.  I am sorry I can´t  email you all individually, I was under the very mistaken belief that this program would be a bit less strenuous, they say that it is, but they lie, it like the reading assignments that never end.  I look like hell, don´t have time for makeup and have let my hair go curly.  I am so damn tired.  Yesterday 15 girls and I decided to mastermind a jaunt into Madrid, very stupid choice on my part, it took into the wee hours of the morning to make up for time lost in Madrid.  This is also hard.  Apparently St. Mary´s is stupid and wrong, this isn´t a Bankruptcy course, this opens with Debtor-Creditor relations (a course I hadn´t heard of at St. MU), then we move onto Bankruptcy, then Secured Transactions, then wrap-up with Spanish/civil law.  To all the non law-junkies, thats a three hour course, followed by a three hour course, topped off with a three hour course, and a full other round of law school in the civil tradition.  WHAT AM I DOING?  I am buying sleeping pills today.  Mom can you fill my prescription ones and have daddy fedex them to me?  I need to sleep.  I have to dink café con leche constantly and still can´t function.  This sucks.  I hate law school.  Oh and the kicker is that the Dean keeps asking me to climb this literal mountain behind us, a 5 mile climb, how can I say no?  He is really excited and thinks I want to go, I want to get my reading done and figure out what Bankruptcy is?  I have to figure out how community property in Texa sfigured into a case where the Husband owed IRS taxes and wife didn´t get to claim her vested interest in her half of his money, something about the govt having priority, but even though the case said she wasn´t liable, only her husband was, that they could still get at half of her money through community property  because of his vested interest in her property.  Seems like a double edged sword, she has a half interest in  his income and is not at fault, but can´t protect her share, while he is the wrongdoer and his the only one liable, gets to pay off his debt by also accessing part of her half vested interest in his income.  What in the hell did I just say?  Did I mention I didn´t like property law?
