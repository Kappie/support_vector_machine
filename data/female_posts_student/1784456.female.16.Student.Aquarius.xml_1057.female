Kerosene! Hehe... ehe... Oh, by the way your blog didn't post! Aww, poor Lynne! Mmm yeah, yesterday was fun! About five people didn't turn up, and that's a record for us! (Usually it's every one who doesn't turn up apart from us) Hehoo not really! We watched the Princess Diary's *yawn* That sucked. With a capital Q! And then we watched Evil Woman which was err... dodgey and umm freaky! But it had the guy out of Tenacious D in it! :O Then we started a pillow fight! Oh, Emma went to get a ball out back and got hurt so I had to leg it with no shoes on to the alley at the back of my house with a first aid kit! Hehehoo! Geez I'm weird! And freezing cold at the moment... I'm starting to think that big flares with stringy top isn't good. Cooold hands. Yeah, well... this is random... I'll go clean my teeth, bubi!
