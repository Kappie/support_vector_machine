Its HARD to drive correctly when you are crying.   i dont know.  i suck.  and i am truly the biggest idiot in the whole world. i am seriously just so dumb sometimes i want to crash my car into a gas tank and explode into little flaming bits. i really hate how stupid  i am. maybe its from doing drugs. i dont know. i feel so distant from anyone, like when i interact with people im not really there, and when im standing in a group i feel like im watching a movie of some people talking but im not there. i almost dont feel... real i guess?  yeah. whatever. ill go join the masses and jump off a fucking cliff.  on the bright side, i saw liz and helen and tana today. they rock my socks. tana is so gorgeous and helen makes me feel good and liz makes me feel special. and we both have blonde hair, haha.  i really wish i had someone to talk to... like, who would actually listen and not fake it. i guess i dont really have very many people in my life who i feel are like that.  i wanted to go to oasos today but the jackass i work for decided he wanted to play basketball and was all "oh, cant you go next week? cant you cancel your plans you had and watch my horrible children for 3 1/2 more hours? yeah. thanks. ::walks out door::"  and then i almost killed helen and kelsey. sweet jesus. sorry, guys.  i dont know. i hope kye is doing better.  i really wish i had someone to give me a hug right now, as stupid as it sounds. i dont like being alone....  ~abby
