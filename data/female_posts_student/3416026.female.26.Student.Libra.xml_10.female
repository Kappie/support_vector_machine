As much as a world of bagels is a dream come true, BagelWorld reminds me of Disney World (creepy!) or some sort of homogenized superstore from, like, the Simpsons.  Only not as cool as the Simpsons.  And no Apu.  Anyhow, I prefer Bageltique.  Doesn't the "tique" offer a certain panache that "world" does not? I think so. And you can bet your boots, Bageltique is ALL panache.  First there is the line, which on Saturday and Sunday mornings you will probably have to stand in for about 20 minutes.  This gives you lots of time to check out all the couples though!  There are about three varieties:  1) TOTALLY MARRIED: ("Sweetie- do I like the tofu cream cheese or just the regular fat                         free?")  2) COLLEGE-TO-REAL-WORLD RELATIONSHIP: ("Um, maybe it wasn't such a good idea for us                                           to move in together. Oh hey, do you have                                           enough cash to get this? Thanks.")  3) MET SIX HOURS AGO: ("Holy shit, that bacon cream cheese is not doing a thing for                           my hangover.")  Another great thing about Bageltique is that it is magic.  When you get to the front and place your order, there begins an astonishing, Tasmanian-devil-like display of frenetic activity.  And yet... and yet... despite all the movement, it takes SO long to get your food! Magic.    But that's ok, because then you have plenty of time to read the incongruous Dilbert desk calendar up at the register, or read the headline on the Daily News, or try to convince yourself not to buy 6 mini muffins to go with your bagel.  The best thing that ever happened at Bageltique was when some Dad ordered a bagel with lox.  The dude behind the counter totally slung that lox right on the grill, much to the extraordinary distress of the Dad.  I thought he was going to have a coronary! It was absolutely fantastic.  I of course scope the local boys who work in my favorite stores and bars and stuff.  Bageltique has the king of 'em all, Chin Strap Boy.  I light up when I see him. Ching! He is named so because he has this meticulously trimmed chin strap beard. It is astonishing.  He also has bad teeth and is a little pudgy, but that chin strap, oh man!  I always see him hanging around on the sidewalk talking to these hottie Boriquas so I think it totally works for him.  One time I went in there and I was, you know, sort of   urlLink gently hungover  . Strangely, that's often when I am at my wittiest.  Anyhow, that day me and Chin Strap were like, holy shit. Bam bam bam! Like Bernie and Cedric. Those jokes were flying, I'll tell you.  Speaking of which, Bageltique is open 24 hours a day! One time we were walking home from  urlLink O'Connor's  and had the drunk munchies.  There is nothing better than Bageltique at 3 in the morning.  If you get a sandwich with cold cuts you won't be sorry. They make this delish bagel monstrosity with turkey which is so huge that you would never attempt to shove such a  sandwich in your mouth in public... unless you were drunk. Nice!
