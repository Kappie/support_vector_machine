Inspired by  urlLink  Haro   and this utterly boring and rainy day, I decided to publish some test results, all from  urlLink  Quizilla  : ~:~   What kind of girl are you?       You're an every day average girl. You aren't amongst the popular crowd, but you are definatly far from being a geek. You are probably pretty, but not gorgeous. You have a fair amount of friends, but each one of them means the world to you. Keep them close and don't change yourself.    Which dysfunctional care bear are you?           What movie do you belong in?           Which of the greek Gods are you?         What color angel are you?      You're a "Blue Angel". You're a smarter one than most and are the more logical than anyone you know. You also have very strong morals that you stick to through it all and you'd stand up for whatever you believe in even if no one else agrees. You're a little bit shy around people but you love to be with lots of people anyway. You have appreciation for things like music or poetry or art. You yourself can sing fairly well but you don't like to sing in front of people. You're very thoughtful and people love how creative you are.
