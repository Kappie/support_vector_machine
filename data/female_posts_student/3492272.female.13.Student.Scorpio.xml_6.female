I don't really have a "LIFE" so usually I read or write poems or play my guitar... That and school takes up most of my time.. My 20 year old sister Becky is having a baby boy in July so IM going to be an Auntie.. So that's some thing for me to look forward to.. I have friends but I don't really talk to them much outside of school.. IM not in to the whole gossip shit unless some thing really bad is said about me or about some one I really care about... I have learned a lot in my life this year... The most important thing I learned is not to get my hopes up because when what you were hoping for doesn't happen it makes you feel so hurt inside because you wait for some thing that some one promises and then they let you down.. So now I am really care full and I don't get my hopes up because I don't want to be let down again.... Also I learned that the people closest to you are the ones who hurt you they most... Never trust some one a lot because in the end they will probably lie to you and then that hurts you a lot...well la8ta..
