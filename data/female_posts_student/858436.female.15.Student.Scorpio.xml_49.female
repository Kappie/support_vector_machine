Liz Hawkins. What an awesome person she was. She is missed very much.  I found out from Myka's xanga that Nathan passed away over break. That's so sad. I didn't know him. He was in my geometry class. It's still just heartbreaking.   Time to be random again.  *Mississippi must really love the song "It's My Life" by No Doubt, because I heard it on the radio about 45 million times.   *I feel... weird. "I'm weird but I'm feelin' fine." I don't know, I just don't feel myself.   *It feels good to be home and I can't wait to see everyone. :-)
