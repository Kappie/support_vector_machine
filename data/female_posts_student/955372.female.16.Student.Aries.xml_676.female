Then I come home and there is one waiting for me from "Edifi" so i show mom and she goes "oh yeah you got like two others from other people, i through them away." yes. thank you mother. I'm like "i kinda needed those" and she's like "you don't need that" and i was all "oh is there some college fund you have that i didn't know about, because as far as i've been told YOU HAVE NO MONEY FOR MY COLLEGE" yeah, that shut her up. baha.
