Jessica and I hung out after work and went to McDonald's for some food.  The lady was soo nice, she gave us free Happy Meal NeoPets!  Rock on!  Mine is a cute little green frog looking thing.  He is awesome.  So we hung out in the parking lot and ate out food till around 10 till midnight.  And now I am here.  Aren't you all lucky!  Haha, just kidding! Oh yea, Nick has yet to IM me, post or even call me to tell me 1. why he doesn't want Chelsea talking to me, and 2. why he just couldn't tell me about Sara and lead me on like he did... I will let you all know how the update is going later.  Right now, sleepy time with my new little froggy.
