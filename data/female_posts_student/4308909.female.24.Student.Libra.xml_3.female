I guess I might be interested in making recommendations for a slight redesign but I don't think their current website is that far from being great. However, I'm really open to doing a lot of other things but I'm not sure what's available to do at this point. As long as I'm learning it's fine by me. I like to be creative and helpful as long as it's productive :-)
