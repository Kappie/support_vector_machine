Do you remember that seen at the end of Goonies right before the big sailboat comes from outside the rocks?  That is what is looks like exactly in Cabo. Just gorgeous white sands, the bluest water you have ever seen and resort style hotels all over the beach. I went to a great restaurant called "The Fish House" and I had a chicken sandwich. hehehe. Seafood is an everyday thing and chicken is a rarity.  Anyway a huge pitcher of Sangria was $9.00 and we didn't even finish it. I did some shopping, rode in a rickshaw an came back to the ship. Pretty uneventful day.   My bosses (9 of them, all greek) played a huge prank on me yesterday. Vassilis, my main boss, called me into his office and told me that as tradition the newcomer had to clean the outside of his windows. So he had a towel and a bottle on windex on his desk. I was almost laughing because I was like, "Ok his office is about 5 feet from the water. Am I going to be hoisted down or what???" He was very serious about it and he told me to report to the staff captain at the bridge at 8 this morning. So all night I was wondering around the ship talking to all the head officers trying to figure who else had done this weird crap before as well.  Everyone was like, oh it's fine. Don't worry about. Only the people that Vassilis likes are invited to do it so you have to do it. THey made up this huge elaborate story about how I would have to sign a release form.  I was thinking, "Are these people f**king crazy??????"  I sent Jen an email immediately telling her all about it. Hahaha. Anyway, I reported to the bridge and all the officers stood there - me in my shorts and tshirt ready to be hoisted down the side of the ship. Vassilis tells me I need to wear my uniform when I do it. (Panty hose, jacket, skirt, blah blah). I turned aorund to go back to my cabin and change when everyone starts laughing saying, "Welcome aboard."  It was some huge big prank on me and of course since I a) so gullible and b) not familiar with the industry - I fell for it.  It was funny though. I was shocked.   Anyway, last night was formal and I had my first night of picking tables and escorting guests. I felt like a diva! I wore like 6-8 grand of diamonds (loaned to me from the onboard jewelry store) and just felt like biggest of best. It was very glamourous and just a blast. It was success and now everyone board knows me as the social hostess. Crew/staff that don't know me personally stop and introduce themselves - it's so flattering and just adorable. The people here are truly wonderful.   I should run though. Busy, busy, busy.    As the greeks say, "Ciao."
