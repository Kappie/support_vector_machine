My 17th bday is in 2 days. :D:D:D So far, what iv gotten out of my recent life is, 13 wasn't so great, 14 was cool, 15 sucked asss, and 16 was pretty awsome. So from the way it looks, the odd numbers are not so hot...? I dunno. Somehow I think this year will be good.  "You should write what you know."  Sometimes I think I know nothing, then later, I think I know everything. Its funny how you can't break down your own thoughts, and understand them consistently. One minute, you can make something into the biggest deal of your life, but then later, you see it's nothing........?  Anywho.. back to birthday. i think that ill start off this age by getting good and smashed. Wow. Did I just use the word "smashed"... arg  but anywho.. I am very excited to be 17. YAY... so far, bday recognitions have been fun! GOODBYE!
