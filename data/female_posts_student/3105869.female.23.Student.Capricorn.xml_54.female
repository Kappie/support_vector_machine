Even if you have been experiencing difficulties, now you can transform your own hurts as you help others. You have the capability to be methodical in how you express yourself, yet simultaneously you can appear more lighthearted by what you say. No matter as easygoing you seem, the real you will come through -- and your passion will fuel whatever changes are taking place.  This is my AOL horoscope for today, by Rick Levine.
