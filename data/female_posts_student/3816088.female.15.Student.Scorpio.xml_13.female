I feel verbally abbused by Kathy lol jk I love that lady. But anyway my next driving class I take my test and then I am like almost done. All I have to do is come in a do parallel parking and now I have observed it twice so I think ill be like a master at it. lol it is sooo boring! Anyhoo after I drove I went to dance and omg!! I guess I worked really hard or am just plain out of shape because I got soo tired by the end. We worked on our orbitz a lot again and did A LOT of just jumping up and down in jazz and did this new thing and I cant reallyu think of what it is called. and then in hip hop the combonation we did was like all legs and almost no arms. Which  I really really love but it can take a lot out of you if your not prepared for it. But I am happy because today in jazz I got my double pirouette!! Except I am having trouble spotting both turns. Like i get my first one spotted and then my 2nd is like lost. I dont know..whatever! But other than all that crap I had so much fun today! We did the cutest combo for hip hop and I think I acctually remember it...maybe! lol Anyways tomorrow I leave for Hawaii! At 2 o'clock and then we land in LA at 5 our time 3 their time and are there for 3 hours which sucks and then we take off again and finally arrive in Hawaii 5 1/2 hours later. Which is like 1:30 our time and only like 8:30 their time. I am going to be soo screwed up! But whatever!! Feel free to text me at any time. I will be back next Thursday if you want to do anything then just give me a buzz!! I love you heather
