If I ever am “normal”.  But seriously, once, my friend Brooke and I stayed up all night before the District Forensics Tourney, and we were what you would call “high on life”.  We got into so many fights the next day because we were so tired, and we had some kid on our team tell us “See, this is what happens when you two don’t sleep”.  Whatever Drew.  But don’t you agree?  Do you laugh a lot harder when you are tired, and haven’t slept in forever?  I think everyone does.  There’s just something about laughing until your head hurts, ahhhh.  All right, this article could very well be a testament, because its really late, and I have a feeling that when I read it tomorrow, I will be like, yeah, that’s what you write when you are tired, dude.  But I guess we will see...for now I am going to go stay up until I laugh at my dresser, and other random objects with no comic appeal.  **Later Days**
