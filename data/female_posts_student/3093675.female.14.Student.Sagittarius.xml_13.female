Well, i don't know if you listen to A7x or not, but their bass player(Johnny Christ)'s dad (or at least thats who he said he was)said thanks for saying Johnny was my favorite guy in avenged. Also, he sent me this pic of Johnny holding his nephew... very cute, but i can't post it because i dont know how! 'Twas adorable, though.   Ok, now onto my long-awaited ramble.   Topic= Religion First of all, to the best of my knowledge, religion is a way of worshipping whatever supernatural powers you believe in. So why is it that some people believe that they have the   authority   to decide what is and isn't a religion?  Most of these people are Christians. Now, I don't want to give Christians a bad name, there are plenty of open-minded Christians who are nice people who worship their God the way they choose to. Heck, to a certain extent, I'm a Christian, because I believe in Jesus Christ being the son of God. But it is true that a lot of the people i know of who have scoffed at other religions are Christians, the kind of Christians that always seem to think that they are right and anyone who believes differently is wrong. And the religion they seem to scoff at the most is Wicca.   The most annoying part about this is that most of these  people don't know shit about Wicca. For instance, they have no idea what the Wiccan Creed is ("An it harm none, do what ye will"). And yet they insist that Wicca isn't a religion. HellO? That doesn't seem right to me.  On to the second part of my rant- this one is about being Homophobic as a part of a religion. Now, there is a verse in the bible- I honestly wish i could remember which one- that says that homosexuals are evil because they "worship the creature, not the creator". And yet it's not against Catholicism for a man to be in love with a woman, although that should probably constitute as worshipping the creature rather than the creator. I personally believe that this is just another way for the Catholic Church to justify not having sex for reasons other than reproduction. Think about it, they don't allow birth control either. It just goes along with the one rule that pretty much covers Catholicism- "if it feels good, stop". Thats what a lot of hardcore Catholics need to learn- they don't have to live in misery just to be happy in the afterlife. In closing, i also want to mention that the Bible was both written and translated many times over by humans. Now if humans are flawed, what keeps a lot of the stuff in the bible from being slanted information and mistranslations?  Mood- angry at the world Music- A Global Threat
