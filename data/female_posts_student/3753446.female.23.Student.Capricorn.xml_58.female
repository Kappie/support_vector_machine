You may recall it as the exam that left me crying a few days ago. Luckily I haven't shed a tear since. I've survived at Cup O Joe, Borders, and the ISP library from 8 am to nearly 11 pm every day. I had only a cell phone and this blog to maintain contact with the outside, living world. I listen to Los Lonely Boys and Modest Mouse every day in my car as a reward, and I even took tonight off to chill at North Market and Ben and Jerry's with some friends. Right now as I revel in my last moments pre-exam, I feel like my head is the size of the Hindenberg, dangerously full of information, and its going to explode over the next two days, spilling random medical factoids all over Columbus. Watch out dear city. I've never taken a two day test before.  It sounds exhausting. I guess it will be kind of like a finals week. Its been a long time since I had one of those. I don't recall having an exam this stressful since the MCATs. Although, I was one of the anti-premeds back at CWRU (most people didn't even know I was) and didn't really prepare for the MCAT at all. In fact the week before the test I was spending my days in Reslife training and moving into my new room. Given that experience, and where it got me, I guess I really shouldn't worry. I know my stuff and its just a matter of trusting myself when I have a good first answer. That is SO much easier to say than to do. Why is it that its so much easier for my friends and family to have faith in me than for me to have faith in myself? I haven't decided if I will study tomorrow or not. I'll see how burnt out I am after the second test. Upon speaking with the brown crown rumor mill, I've been told that this test has a way of making you feel like a dumb shit, no matter how hard you prepared, no matter how well you actually did. Knowing this in advance is somewhat comforting, because I know that I won't be the only one feeling like a medical admissions error.   All in all, I don't know what to make of this whole exam or how I'll do, but at this point in time I feel good about it and I'm looking forward to ending the madness Thursday. For now, I guess I just gotta go with whatever's in my head and in my gut and call it a day. Or two. Time for some cerebral fuel (sleep). Gnight!
