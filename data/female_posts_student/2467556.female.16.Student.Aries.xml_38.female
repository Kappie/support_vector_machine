Right so me and Brittany had this theory that all finnish people have perfect skin and zero acne......and every finnish person that we've seen/met.....which is a grand total of 6 including the one finn that disproved our theory, has met these requirements.  So we see this new finn and he's got just a slight bit of acne....he's not terribly bad looking but....yeah.   So this guy kills our theory of all finns have perfect skin.  So we don't like this person very much, lol.  I'm not going to say his name etc to protect his innocence.  Yeah but then we made a new theory that out of the 6 finns we've met only one had non-perfect skin, so therefore 1 out of every 6 finns must have non-perfect skin and yet therefore again, our theory still lives.  We were happy.  We made this up while eating at Quizno's after school today.    If you haven't heard already, i'm supposed to go to Lubbock, TX on Friday and come back on Sunday/Monday.  RANDOMLY.  There is absolutely no reason to go to Lubbock this 4 day weekend except for the fact that my parents want to see their Alma Mater University again and they want me to see it too.  They said i could bring a friend, but no one is able to go because they're busy.  I'm not even going to Texas Tech or any Texas School for that matter so why should i go see this school.  I think they're just worried i'm going to leave the country or Texas, so they think by showing me the Tech campus, its somehow going to make me want to stay in this state.  No, thats ok, really, i'll go to Michigan thanks.  Or New York.  And then i'll transfer to somewhere in Europe for gosh sakes.  But i'm not staying here.  Here's the good news though, my dad is thinking about cancelling the trip!!!  YAAAY!!  Thank god, i don't want to go at all!   And i'm pretty sure we're not going now, but who knows.  I hope my mom will just get over it and not fight it.  Whatever.  Stars game tomorrow against San Jose.  Eeek.  We need to win this game really bad.  I mean, really bad.  As of right now, Pheonix is beating us by one point (i think, if they haven't won) and SJ is beating us by about 6.   If we can get past Pheonix....i think we'll be ok.  We're number 9 right now.  i hope and pray they'll make it through.  if we don't make it in the playoffs this year, i think i'll cry and i'll be crushed.  And there are very few people that can comfort me at that point.  Brittnee knows, with experience from when Coppell lost to Southlake Carroll at Metroplex 5-1.  Oh man, i cried at that game.  Brittnee was threatening to take me home and i told her i didn't care and blah blah blah.  My dad and the other Brittany know with experience of when the Stars lost to Anaheim last year in the playoffs.  Yeah.....you don't want to know, its bad.  Please please please please let them win.  Oh yeah, and i haven't heard anything or whatever, but i'm hoping that Niko will make it into the youngstars game at the all-star weekend....he's still in his first 3 years of contract, so i think he can still qualify.    Right so, i'm going to go to bed and i wish you all the best of luck of getting through  this week before the 4-day weekend.  Oh yeah, and tomorrow is Orlando Bloom's birthday.  He'll be 27, so wish him the best 27th birthday silently in your head or tell everyone about it.  I declare Orlando's bday as Official Worship/Drool-Over-Orlando-Bloom Day.  So participate.  Cheers.  17 more days until me, Britty and Jess go to our first Stars game together!  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~
