That was my childhood nickname which i still find cute and childish. Well, that's me. I have to be true to myself, ya know, and because none of you know me!  I have a sister, and brothers.  You know, i'm a type of person that if i meet someone new, i'm like a statue that cannot move nor talk. I'm a shy person, but once you get to know me, i'm loud (well, that's what my mom said), sassy, and sometimes entertaining if you're sad. I'm like a clown to my friends, but i don't really talk much in our house because, i'm shy.  Well anyways, i don't really want to "expose" myself because i just don't want.  (IF YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR ME, JUST WRITE IN COMMENTS! BUT I'M NOT ASSURING YOU THAT I WILL ANSWER THEM ALL, BECAUSE I CAN'T USE THE INTERNET IN THE MORNING...)
