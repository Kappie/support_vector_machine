The LIS program is located in the basement of the enormous research library at UH, and we felt our hearts skip as we trundled down the stairs into the chilly depths. Waiting for the students to all arrive, we set ourselves to the refreshments. I decided to be naughty and make a cup of Earl Grey, and deftly plucked up a peppermint tea bag instead, not realizing my error until it was to my lips. My mother laughed and decided to show me how to make a proper cup of tea, picking out the bag of Earl Grey I had been aiming for, and proceeding to pour hot coffee into it instead of water. Both of us proving too incompetent to make a cup of tea, we proceeded in to the class for orientation.  It was, surprisingly, quite interesting. I stumbled into this field merely because my mother and grandmother found it agreeable, knowing nothing of it at all, myself. As it happens, it seems to suit me quite well. Who knew? I was particularly intrigued by archiving, and the preservation of books.  I was foiled by my advisor, who did not recommend I take 4 classes, as I had planned. It appears that 4 classes, each requiring a 30-page paper, just may have been overwhelming. Gah. So 3 it is, and I will start on Monday, providing the Financial Aid office get my loan papers to me in time.   There are only 4 men in our class. One is a military fellow from Laos, who is preparing to go AWOL, as his orders came in 2 days ago, and he refuses to attend lock-down on Thursday. It will be interesting to see if his lawyer gets him off. One man is a large Hawaiian guy with tattoos and a big laugh, a professional photographer with 4 children. The other fellows are about my age, one is a skinny quiet kid, and the other is haole boy from the mainland who plays bass guitar. I plan to corner that one and twist his arm into playing with Mike. Mwah ha ha ha. Overall, the rest of the women in the class are amazingly fun to talk to, and many also have toddlers at home. Libraries tend to attract a similar sort of nerdy people, I think, and I can't wait to get to know them better. Already, I was huddled up with a woman named Eileen, comparing schedules to make sure we had some classes together. I always get along better with people about 20 years older than me, for some reason, but I have to say that there was a young woman from Oregon whom I found delightful. Skinny, with jerky hand gestures, hunched posture, and bucket hat pulled down to her eyebrows, she was sharp and clever and posessed of a wealth of perceptive opinions. I think this year is going to be wonderful.   In the end, we were terribly late coming home, and had to pick up Gavin from the theatre. I was so excited to see him after such a long day apart, but he seemed perfectly fine without me. Alas! My baby is growing up. All the same, he hugged me and cuddled up to nurse immediately. That night, I fell asleep while nursing him, and we snoozed soundly until morning (except for one or two incidences with a dive-bombing cockroach). Part of me mourns for my wasted drawing ability, and I couldn't help but to gaze enviously at the art building as I walked by yesterday, but I feel this is the right path. Sometimes I have to tell myself that more than once, but I'm beginning to believe it more and more.
