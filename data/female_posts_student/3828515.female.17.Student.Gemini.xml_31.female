What's up with that? Frustrating. Also, I will unfortunately never understand why women are attracted to men with brown hair and blue eyes because not enough scientific research has been done on the topic to provide a base for my own further research :P. Steph, I know you'll be disappointed to hear this. Anyways. Not too much happened today. I went to Jewel Middle School in North Aurora for a rehearsal for this Aurora band thing that I'm supposed to be involved with at 6:30 this evening, but no one was there! I tried to call Mr. Heath, but, being the excessively preoccupied person that he is, he was not at home. Oh well. Looks like I'm not going to the concert tomorrow... if there is one after all :P. I don't really remember anything else that happened today, except for when my brother tried to wave his hand in front of my face, missed, smacked me right in the nose, and managed to poke both of my eyes. That sucked. So I'll call that my day.     Last song I listened to:   Only The Strong  by Flaw.   Last album I listened to:   The Best Of George Gershwin .   Last meal I ate:  Spaghetti and meatballs.   Last movie I watched:   For Your Eyes Only .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I listened to random drumline cadences throughout the day.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I explained to my brother that we can hit the air, but it's always hitting us harder... Each particle hits us at 500 miles per hour :).   Last person I talked to:  Dan or Steph.   Favorite song today:   Careless Whisper  by Ben Folds featuring Rufus Wainwright.   Favorite food today:  Spaghetti :).   Most interesting thing I did today:  Criticized my brother's graphic designs. I love critic authority :).   Funniest thing that happened today:  Ugh. I have no idea.
