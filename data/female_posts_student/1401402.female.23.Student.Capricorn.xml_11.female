Forever Sakdary, represent myself. I love my name because its one of a kind. Although, I would be pisted off if there was someone elsewhere with the same name! I am so selfish. Errr.  Its Cambodian's new year. I went to the temple today, pray, hung out with relatives and ate a whole bunch of delicious food. Mmmm, my favorite food aye! Has got to be papaya salad extra spicy :). Then comes desert, ouu, yummy in my tummy. Duran over sweet rice. Oh man, i've got to make myself some of that soon. The best part of the day at the temple was praying. Yes, praying is what I love to do most. During the whole process I picked up this can with a whole bunch of sticks inside. Each stick was assign to a number. Your suppose to wish or pray for something or have something in mind. But at that time my mind went blank. I sat there shaking the can, waiting for a single stick to pop out. Three mintues later a stick fell out. It was a number four. Yeah, this better be good!!! Got a piece of paper that indicate a briefly message to my head and it hit me. It states "Parting from loved one envisaged, may be a longtim before reunited. Cooperation needed in conducting activities. Avoid taking role as a leader. Patient recovering. More likely to win legal case. Hidden ones still not found. A baby boy forthcoming". Umm, lets talk about this shall we?  Parting from my love one? Cant seem to think of who that person might be. Could this be true? Who knows! Theres only one person whom I wish to see and be close to. Dinner friday night might be cancel. Longtime before reunited again? This could be somewhat true. Oh well, life goes on...NEXT... Patient recovering? For sure i'm putting myself in this cage where i'm not out with my friends doing things I used to do. Thats about it! HIdden ones still not found? Dunno what your talking about!!! A baby boy forthcoming? HELLA NO!!! I'm not having another baby. In your dreams.
