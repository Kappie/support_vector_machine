So I went into town and went to Hallmark and saw LeeAnne and she helped me pick out a card. Then after spending like a half hour there I went to Wal-Mart to pick up a present for Rach. I got her these dark chocolate Dove-brand candies that she loves (and that we ate last year in study hall when we were depressed). And I bought her some scrap booking stuff. Then I went home this different way (the way LeeAnne usually goes) and I learned it's about 3 minutes faster. Woohoo! So I quickly wrapped her stuff and packed all my clothes and stuff and went to Rach's.  As soon as I got there she just got out of the house and got in my car because we were going to the movies. It ended up being just the two of us, which was fun. We went to Wooster and we went a back way which was very interesting. I was kind've nervous because I had no idea where we were half the time. But we got there safely. We got to the theatre about 5 minutes after the show started but when we got in the theatre there were still lots of previews to see. We saw "The Notebook" by the way. It was such a good movie!! It was so incredibly sad though!! I mean, I figured I would cry, but it was getting close to the end and I kept saying to myself, "Oh I won't cry." But it got to the end and the tears came. In streams. The end was so sad and then it like ended and no one moved in the theatre. The credits had started rolling and no one moved, spoke a word, made a sound, except for the occassional sniffle. After a minute people started leaving. I just looked over and Rach and I was praying that I wouldn't start sobbing because I was on the verge of it and she was like, "Want a piece of chocolate?" And half choking on my tears I'm like, "Yeah." lol. It actually helped somewhat. We left when the credits were over. We were the last ones out. And so after that we were both very emotionally drained. It was funny though we thought we were gonna burst out in tears about anything.   We had to stop at the video store so she could drop off a movie and then we headed home. I was quite nervous driving back because I hate driving at night in places I'm not familiar with. I am pretty blind at night so I am so glad I have glasses and that my car has brights!! We finally got back to her house and LeeAnne came over. We just talked for a while and then got online for a little bit and set Rach up a blog on here then we went back upstairs to the kitchen because we were hungry. We made macaroni and cheese (my fave!) and we were trying to roast marshmallows over a candle, but it just turned black. So we roasted a few over the stove. And then we had rootbeer floats. It was good stuff. And then LeeAnne and I started singing "Summer Nights" from Grease because we sang it on Karaoke at her graduation party. It was so hilarious. I was recording it on my cell phone and we listened to it and we were dying laughing. We were all so giddy. You had to be there. So then we all changed into our pajamas, brushed our teeth and what not, and headed back down to the basement to go to bed. LeeAnne slept on a mattress on the floor, Rach on the couch, and lucky me, on the love seat. We talked for a really long time and we were laughing so hard about the stupidest things. And then we started talking about the government for a while, and I fell asleep.   So today when I woke up LeeAnne had already left and Rach and I headed upstairs to eat breakfast (Krispy Kreme donuts!) and tried to work out the Word Jumble thing in the paper. We couldn't unscramble "MESTIK." If anyone figures it out, please do me a favor and TELL ME! Then we went out to see her two kittens and cat and sat out there for a while. And then I got ready to go. I still had my pajamas on and said "Well, I figure no one'll see me anyway." And Rach was like, "Yeah, but you'll get pulled over and get a DWI...Driving while indecent." Hehe. So on the way home I was driving back on the roads by Brad's house and they were tarring and laying gravel down on the road and there was a sheriff/patrol guy there and I had to roll down my window to talk to him. How ironic, eh? So I did run into a police person. Then I got home took a quick shower, dried my hair straight, and my mom, brothers, and I left to go to Mansfield.  We went to Old Navy first to look at stuff for Drew's birthday. I did end up finding a really cute shirt though, so I got it. Then we went to Toys R Us for like 15 minutes, grabbed some candy from there, and headed to the dollar theatre by Kohl's. Okay I don't know what it is with me, but I thought the ticket guy was, well, cute. And it's very odd because he had pretty long hair. But it suited him. I don't know what it is with long hair and me. But I like it. Not too long, as long as it's groomed. But he was cute. ANYWAY, we ended up seeing the Garfield movie. It was pretty good. I mean I'm glad we only paid 75 cents for it. After that we met my dad at Steak N Shake for dinner. It was really good. Then my dad and brothers went home and my mom and I went to the pet shop by Kohl's (I forget what it's called) so I could see the animals. There were these adorable Jack Russell terriers. They were so cute. But this cat was sooooo cute. I wanted to get it out and hold it, but I just tapped on the glass and it seemed pretty content just following my fingers. Then I went back to Kohl's to meet my mom. And we were there FOR-EV-ER! I was bored out of my mind.   We FINALLY left and went to Gabe's. My mom ran in real quick, and then we went to Target because I wanted to see if I could buy this one bathing suit top, but the swim suits were all gone!! I was devastated, not really. But anyway. Mom bought a purse and we made my weekly trip to Best Buy. Dan of course wasn't working. In case you're wondering about this Best Buy thing, let me explain. Best Buy has become LeeAnne and my place to go while we're in Mansfield. I want to go because I want to see Dan Kubasek (he used to be in my grade, real shy, was home-schooled, became real outgoing). I just like talking to him because he's a cool guy now. So whenever we're in town I stop in to see if he's working. I've stopped not 3 times, not 4, not 5, but SIX times this summer, and have not seen him. So my mom asked some guy there and we found out he works this Friday and Saturday. Might have to stop back. =)  So mom and I headed home, in the pouring rain. I was sure glad I wasn't driving. And that leads me to here. That's about it I guess. Can't wait until Cedar Point! Woo! =)
