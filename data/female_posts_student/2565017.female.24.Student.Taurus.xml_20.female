Anyway... what actually happened, was that I slept shamefully late.... listened to a thunderstorm for a couple of hours...whatched TV, ate.... now eating again (veggie PIZZA, even tho I promised I wouldn't eat any in months). This is terrible =)  It's silly to even write the blog, since there's nothing to tell about!!!  Embarrassement...  I'll write more later, when there's something to tell.
