Too bad, I am cheap and jumped on the first free blogger site I found.   So today was good. Didn't have too much going on.  Last night I had dinner with my new friend, Uma. It was her, myself, the lead conceirge (Jackie), and another girl Stephanie. We had special arrangements in the formal dining hall. It was in the Palm Springs area of our ship and it was very formal.  We were celebrating Uma's birthday. It was really fun.  It's amazing how close you get to people in such a short period of time on board.  I mean you eat every meal with them, go for an afternoon cocktail when you have some downtime, talk about anything and everything. It's great. I really like Uma though. She's a Chinese Canadian girl who speaks fluent french and bits and pieces of about 14 languages. Pretty impressive! I am learning a lot about the greek language through interactions with our officers. Like, "Ella."  Ella can mean a thousand things depending on the context. It can mean, Come on you are pulling my leg.  Or Ellaaa, you are so stupid. Interesting language, greek is. And I pick up accents so easily.  Lately, I slip into some weird european twang when I am talking because I am around people with weird accents all the time. I remember when I went to New York for the first time. I came back after a week and a half talking like a staten island girl. It was awful. Hahaaha, I am so impressionable.   I had safety meetings today. I learned about my life raft.  We have a real setup with life rafts - they can fit 25 crew members and we have food, water, a knife, reflective devises, flashlights, smoke signals, flares, everything. It's really unbeleiveable how much stuff they put in those rafts.  So I was busy with that stuff today for quite a bit.  Then I came back to my office and picked out my tables for our next formal night (Wednesday).  I can't wait to go into Puerto Vallarta tomorrow. I am going to Wallmart (with 2 L's). Go shopping for a bit, eat some lunch and then back to work.  You know, I thought working 70 hours a week would be tough but honestly, it doesn't bother me. Especially since I can go upstairs and sit with Uma for 30 minutes, have a cocktail, shoot the shit and come back downstairs and work. I don't punch a time clock and no one is ever looking over my shoulder. It's just hey, have a good time if you are going to work so much. Pretty great work ethic. Too bad america couldn't adapt to this working lifestyle. I think Europeans experience some of the luxuries that we do on the ship. Afternoon breaks, et al. I know when I was working at ECI none of this would ever be conceivable.   Oh yeah, I had one of the entertainers come to me today. She is so adorable (about 19).  She came to me and said very shyly, "Do you think when you have some time that you might be able to tell me about your job.  I don't want to really work on ships anymore and I would love to get a job being an event planner." I was flattered. It was so sweet. I think I will meet her later tonight and give her some advice (whatever, that may be???) I don't even know how I got here. Hahahaha.  Take care and have a great Monday, whever you are.  Shell
