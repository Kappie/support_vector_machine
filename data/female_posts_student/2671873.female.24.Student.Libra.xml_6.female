In the past year I have been making Chocolate Chip Cookies, and other random desserts.  And have received high praises from my Irish friends.  So I have been thinking that maybe a "Clementine's Cookies" shop would sell over here.  Kinda like the whole Mrs. Fields idea in the states.  It is impossible to get fresh baked cookies here in this part of the world, and most people don't even know a recipe to make fresh cookies here.  So that is where I would come in....not only would it be a cookie shop, but it would also be a place where people could order those ever creative cookie bouquets.  I SERIOUSLY want to do this, but don't have a clue where to start, and how to do it being American.  (why couldn't I be an EU citizen?!) What do you think?  Again I would love my friends input.  I know this is out of the blue, but I have really been thinking about this...and would like to see this become a reality.  I think there is genuinely a market for it here.  Maybe not in Derry, but definitely in Galway.  I look forward to hearing your comments!
