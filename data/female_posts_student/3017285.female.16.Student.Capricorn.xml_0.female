Anyway, AP Euro wasn't too bad. Had to miss out a few multiple choice in the end, because I ran out of time. But the DBQ and Essays were pretty easy. The DBQ was on The Pilgrimage of Grace, and the two essays I did were on comparing/contrasting 17th century absolute monarchs with 20th century dictators (cool question, that) and one abou To What Extent (oo, "to what extent" cue the ominous music) did Romanticism challenge Enlightenment views about human nature etc. Pretty easy.  Now I have to go downstairs and turn off the light, and then go to bed.  Oh yeah, I'm also working on a nice layout for the blog. That is, I have the idea, I still need to put it together.  Night night.
