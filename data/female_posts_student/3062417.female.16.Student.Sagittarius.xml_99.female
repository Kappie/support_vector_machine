She sounds like a mix between Macy Gray and Mickey Mouse on drugs. I want to punch her in the face everytime she opens her mouth. Oh, and I drove around yesterday for a while with my mom.   Today - School again. It was ok I guess. I got a lot of compliments today on how I looked (cause I look sexy lol yea right like that will ever happen). I heart compliments. Dave told me that I was shiny today and that I almost gave him a seisure.lol And everyone said I looked cute today. OKKKK... Now I'm just listening to music. Later I'm going to hang out with Carol and Kim again probally. Or my mom said we might go to the city to look for a new matress for me. Not that I'll sleep in my room anyways because I don't like being alone at all.  Listening to: [A Favor House Atlantic by Coheed and Cambria] Your eyes tell the stories of a day you wish you could  Recall the moments that once have  Retrack the footsteps that brought us to this favor  I wouldn't ask this of you   Good eye, sniper  I shoot, you run  The words you scribbled on the walls  With the loss of friends you didn't have  I'll call you when the time is right Are you in or are you out?  For them all to know the end of us all   Run quick, they're behind us  Didn't think we'd ever make it  This close to safety in one piece  Now you wanna kill me in the act of what could maybe  Save us from sleep and what we are   Good eye, sniper  Now I shoot, you run  The words you scribbled on the walls  With the loss of friends you didn't have  I'll call you when the time is right Are you in or are you out?  For them all to know the end of us all   Bye bye beautiful  Don't bother to write  Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars  Face step, let down.  Face step, step down.   The words you scribbled on the walls  With the loss of friends you didn't have  I'll call you when the time is right Are you in or are you out?  For them all to know   Bye bye beautiful  Don't bother to write  Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars  Face step, let down.  Face step, step down.   Bye bye beautiful  Don't bother to write  Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars  Face step, let down.  Face step, step down.
