Oh well.. other than that.. yesterday Me, Nicole and Rob went to Nick's baseball game, and they won too.  Then I came home and got ready and then went to Rob's game with Nicole and Lauren.  They won also!  It was kinda hard to find the place, but with the directions of my good mommy.. we were able to get there.  After Rob's game we got something to eat from Subway with Missi Amanda Ashley and Josh.  Then, we came back to my house so we could figure out something to do so we weren't driving around.  Jaclyn said that we could come over so we went there and then a bunch of people came.  Nick, Alex, Ryan, PJ, Alex, James... and a bunch more people! Then we stayed there and Nicole took me and Lauren home.  That was the end of that night?  Today - I'm going to the mall w/ Nicole and Ashley.  Then coming home to CLEAN- wonderful... hopefully I can lay outttt ughh!  Maybe I'll see Mike today- probably not b/c his brother is graduating @ like 6 so nevermind that.  LOL This is donee  Byeeee
