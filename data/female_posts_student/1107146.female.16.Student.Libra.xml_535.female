It's so easy to just leave a message on the BLog and forget about it. It makes us live our whole inter-social lives right here.  Which, in some respects isn't such a bad thing. Hell, there isn't any noticeable emotion behind words, unless you're using the strongest kind ("I fucking hate you and wish you were shot"). Is it any wonder that I hate getting online, and thus, never do? Altho that doesn't stop me from BLogging, which is the paradox of our time.  BLogs are like the little journals I intend to keep but never do. Plus, they talk back, or at least, this one does. Getting perspective on any situation is good, even if it is a bad perspective. If there's one thing a bad situation can teach you, it's what  not  to do next time.  Or it can teach you humanity and how things work. Or both, mostly that, actually.  Or it might not teach you anything. Or it might teach you the right thing, but you go about learning it wrong. That's what happens when you get to be, what most people call, "screwed up".   What's really amazing is, though the ultimate goal (for lack of a better word) of life is death, life teaches so much before we go. It's incredible that nature would allow itself to exist when it will certainly die. Including God in this factor, and it's not surprising. But from the godless atheist viewpoint, thinking that nature would weed out the weak, it's surprising that nature didn't weed itself out long ago.  Maybe it expects us to do it for it.  How freakingly Goth is that?!? Did you notice I put it on its own line, for emphasis, too?!? So Goth!!! Notice I'm using more than one end punctuation?!?! WOW!!! NOW ALL CAPS?!? WHAT IS THIS?!?  I almost typed, "what is this shit?". Did you all notice that "this" and "shit" are the same letters all mixed up? I notice this because I was trying to type "this" and I had a Freudian slip and typed "shit" instead. Cool.  So after this largely irrelevent post, I must bid you all adieu. But I had to put that little irrelevent thought in my little irrelevent pseudojournal. How irrelevent.  I am irrelevently yours.
