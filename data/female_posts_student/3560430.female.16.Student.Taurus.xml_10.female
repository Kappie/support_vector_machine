I would like to take this oppertunity to thank Bethie for the beautiful book indicatore. now all I have to do is get her to show me how to use it. I think maybe dad wants me to transit home tomorrow. That should be funny. I'm not a good transit persone... Stop laughing Bethany. It's not very nice. Aug I forgot I have to bathe! Well too late now. I'll do that in the morning. Must go read. Richard is screwing himself over again by not thinking properly or listening to other people's thought a little too closly or not closly enough. I wish he would just look for the simply complex solution this time! But no he will have to go it the hard way first. Sigh... Story of my life.
