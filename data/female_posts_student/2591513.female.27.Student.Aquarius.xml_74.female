I met her during my brief stint at UC santa Cruz.  I must admit I left that school because I didn't feel like I belonged...lol  The sorority I wanted to pledge for didn't show very much interest in me.  lol  So I just took it as a sign that I didn't belong.    Leaving UCSC was a good and bad thing...good because it was the start of the life I have now, bad because I think I missed out a lot on the growing up stuff everyone should experience.  I have been to a club maybe 10 times and I think that might be stretching it.  I have yet to get drunk, but I don't think that will happen since I don't like to drink, really.  Oh and forget smoking anything.  YUCK!  (sorry for all the smokers out there).  So I am just a plain Jane.  Anyway, I am going to her daughter's first birthday and I am so excited about it.  i finally get to meet her baby.  Our daughters are like us, just a month apart.  I look forward to our daughters becoming friends.  When I first met her I thought she was a snob...lol  Let me back track....lol When I first saw her I was happy because there was another filipino there.  lol  I thought my roomie was chinese, but she was filipino too.  haha  Anyway she ended upbeing the sweetest, cookiest drama queen ever.  I love her for her spunkiness.  lol  Life, however short lived it was, at UCSC was definitely tolerable and FUN with her.  You ahve to ask erh about her freshman roomie...lol  Now she was a TRIP!    I have nothing but smiles right now Trish...that post was for you.  I know you remember some of our kookie moments there...too many memories too precious for me to forget.  I love you and thanks for everything. :D
