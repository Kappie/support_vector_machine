Everything seemed to be going very well...sure there were a couple things that made me uncomfortable, but I'll probably have that for a while. I'm sorry other people didn't think it worked out that way. But now that those people have read what I wrote on here, only somewhere else, maybe they will understand something else. I don't know that I wrote anything really worth reading, but maybe I did. I don't know...time will only tell.
