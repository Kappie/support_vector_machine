Elaboration: There are these stupid jackass boys who spend the lunch hour playing hackie-sack(sp) and crap in the hallway myself and friends eat lunch. They've officially taken to annoying the hell out of us by purposefully bunting the thing over to us then throwing a fit when we claim it as our prize for finding it -rolls eyes- Jerks. Today they've taken to picking on all the little guys who have to walk through their group to get downstairs, bully them into the lockers and the like. Ticks the heck outta me... I'll declare war soon, watch it I will. Bullies are the one thing I can't stand more than... umm.. llamas... and THAT is saying A LOT.  So BULLIES BEWARE.  I'm done ranting.. hah.. My trig exam has been pushed back again "due to weather" heh... Monday it is.. weekend of studying... hooray.... Conics test is on Thursday.... Math sucks... I shall lock the bullies in a room and force them to do my math homework.. mwahahaha..... yea... right
