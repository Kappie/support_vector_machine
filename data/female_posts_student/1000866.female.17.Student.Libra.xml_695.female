One of those nights where you just stop trying to get whatever you want to say into the conversation and just listen to what the people around you are saying. You realize that no matter where you are or what you're doing, you can have a good time with these people and you'd do anything for them.   Anyway, obviously, tonight was a ton of fun. Mary Clare's house was great and she and her mom really did a great job decorating and with the food and everything. It was so nice. I really enjoyed myself. The movie was pretty good too. The first meeting of the book club was definitely a success although, I wonder what happened to Kirby. She didn't show up. I'm thinking she might have been doing something with the Japanese exchange students she has. I hope she can make it to the next one. For the next meeting, we've decided on Pride and Prejudice. I'm excited. I've wanted to read it for a while.   Anyway, summer school awaits me in the morning and I'm awfully tired. If you read this Pat, welcome back. :) I hope you had fun in New Jersey.   I'm so happy Mary Clare and Kelly are back too. I missed them a bunch.
