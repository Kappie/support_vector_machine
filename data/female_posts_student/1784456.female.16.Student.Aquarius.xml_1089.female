These asylum seekers are here and it's our duty to protect them. They've taken asylum in our country. Do you really think that they want to come out of one country where they wil probably be killed and go to a country where they are condemned for the colour of their skin or their atributes? Is this fair? Imagine going to Africa and being picked on because 'you were white' surely you wouldn't stand for that, so why should all the 'black' *i hate using that word, sorry* people take the crap they get from us? After Osama Bin Laden attacked America people began to attack muslims. Why? Because they were the same religion. Because they could be in the same sect or whatever as him. What bull shit. Maybe we should have been killed when Hitler began his reign of terror because we came from the same descendents and most of us had blonde hair and blue eyes. Maybe because of the way we looked we could have been a Nazi. What racist crap is going around these days? Why hasn't educating reached out to these people, and beaten them to a bloody pulp until they understood?
