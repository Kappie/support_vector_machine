SPitting, hissing, and screaming, i managed to stuff her in her cardboard carrying case. Then I gave her, along with her wet catfood and Dr. Seuss 'thing 1' toy to her family...they seemed nice enough for having a brat as a cat...  Right. Today. Wow. I worked 6 1/2 hours. You do the math. 8:30am-3:00pm...not fun. Well, I must say, it wasn't an eventless day. I come, and start on the cages...scrubbing all the panels and the cat litter pans, and even the food bowls with bleach. Ouch. Just look at my arms to see the number of cuts that have been burned with bleach today...ouch. Well, so I finish the upper kennel, Niva did the goats, Joh did the whelping shed, and they both did the two puppies. (The upper kennel takes longer)Then we fed all the boarders, which was easy enough.  Halfway through, my boss sort of blew up at another worker named Kathy. This is what i heard:  "I'm not dealing with this shit anymore! I just can't have someone off-the-walls working for me!"-my boss  That was interesting. Of course I forgot a lunch, and while Joh ate her lunch, I played with the barn kittens. Joh named most of them after Japenese animation characters from some TV show she watches...but she let me name the one we found today, the cutest of them all. I named him Gypsy (That's right, musical bitch strikes again. For those of you who don't know, Gypsy is my second-favorite musical.) He is so cute! Fluffy, dark grey, with yellowish markings around his eyes. He's the healthiest of all the barn kittens, most of whom are sick.   With love, April
