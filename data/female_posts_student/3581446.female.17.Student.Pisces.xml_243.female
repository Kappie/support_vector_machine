Although I am only human and at times do let one rip, today's post "Pull my ear" will not be about farts. Today's post will be, on the other hand, about how I singlehandedly pulled my ear right out of its socket, providing ears are, in fact, located in sockets. I don't know. I'm not a fancy doctor like some of you may claim to be to avoid threats of malpractice.   I felt a slight itch. A slight one, peeps, I do wash myself at least twice a month by jumping around in random puddles during rainy season. I felt this itch and the only possible course of action I felt I could take to stop this itch was to pull my ear. In retrospect, it wasn't such a good idea.   As I am writing this post from the waiting room in the hospital while I am waiting for the doctors to attach the silly thing back to my head, I think back to that afternoon: the one where I pulled my ear right out of its socket, for those of you who are a bit slow. I knew I was in trouble when I heard it go snap somewhere in the fuming pits of my external auditory canal as I pulled it. You might wonder now if I pulled the stupid thing by attaching it to a wire, which was, perhaps, in its turn attached to a raging bull. Not at all, all I did was gently tug the lobe in question, expecting the itch to pass and perhaps migrate to a more suitable location, such as the tip of my nose. I assumed that, after the gentle tugging, my ear would comply with my reasonable demands and give me what I want. I certainly didn't expect it to give up so soon without a proper fight!
