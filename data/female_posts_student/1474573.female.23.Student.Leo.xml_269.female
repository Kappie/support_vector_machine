Honestly I dont think its too much to ask to not be "squeezed in" because to me, that's not really quality time.  I didnt have anything really specific to say to her, I just wanted to SEE her, y'know?  And the pressure of possibly having a time limit of what? like a half hour? was just too frustrating to me.    Okay, so She wasnt able to come to the house, so there went seeing the wedding pictures and the new house.  Fine.  Then She was supposed to meet me at Cristian's birthday party (I'd be 'double dipping', but I'd do it for her and B didn't mind) but that didnt happen either.  I got so annoyed that she wasnt calling me like She said She would that when She finally did call, I had nothing but anger, frustration and disappointment on my mind.  At that point it would definitely NOT be all about the love of two friends who hadnt seen each other in a while, so what was the point?  I asked her what her plans for the evening were and She had already made plans and double booked that as well.  (I wasnt a part of those plans, and although I was tired and frustrated, had she offered to have dinner with me, I would have gone.)  So basically She goes back today and once again, I dont get to see her.  And, no, I'm NOT PMSing (John!)   I've never left home and lived that far away that when I came back for a weekend or whatever, I would have to see all the family and friends I left behind, but I know many who do and it can be pretty frustrating.  I had another friend who moved to San Francisco and every time she visited it would be this whole mess of her trying to fit everyone in that sometimes she wished that she came to NYC on the sly and didnt tell the family!  I'm sure its pretty frustrating to try and be accommodating to EVERYONE but I guess I just thought I was one of the more 'important' ones to see.  Why am I always so disappointed!?!  Do I expect too much of people?  Maybe its fate getting back at me for not showing up or cancelling at the last minute back in the day...I dunno...I'm just sad.  On another note, Cristian's birthday party was fun.  I was a little worried about tension at the party since Mommy and Daddy are on the outs and kinda had the 'happy family' facade going on.  But I can honestly say they pulled it off.  Maybe it was the distraction of the kids running around like maniacs and stuff.  Kudos, B!    It's always at these parties that I catch up with B's family like her sisters and brothers and their significant others.  Actually, yesterday was the first time I actually had, like, a  long  conversation with her brother's girlfriend Lucie.  Not that I ever thought she wasnt cool, she's very sweet, I've always known that... but you know those things...lots of people, mingling... you never really get to  know  the person... Well she's cooler than I thought, which is um... cool...  Okay I say "cool" too much.  I've just noticed that.  Now its time for Easter Brunchy-Wunchy with the family-wamily.  YAWN.  Hopefully I can drag my ass into the shower before dinnertime, I mean brunchy time...  heh. heh.    Tomorrow I will go into details about the backyard, the plants we bought/are going to buy and the birds that are eating the fucking $30 a bag grass seed that we put down back there.  I have come to the conclusion that I do not, for the most part, like birds.  Actually, I think that will be the main topic of tomorrow's entry, witha sprinkle of grass seed for good measure.  :-)
