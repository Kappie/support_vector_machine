Although the charges have been dropped she had faced up to one year of jail time.    Texas law allows for the sale of sexual toys as long as they are billed as novelties. But when a person markets the items in a direct manner that shows how they are used in sex, it is considered criminal obscenity.  Does somebody  really  have to be shown how to use one of these things? Isn't it, somewhat, self explanatory?   According to reports in local media and residents of Burleson close to the issue who asked not to be identified, a few prominent citizens with strong Christian beliefs were angered by Webb and her activities. They asked police to investigate.   Are you kidding me! I'd tell those "residents" to mind their own G-d damn business. It's not like anybody was forcing them to attend these Passion Parties. Much less buy a vibrator. Good lord. These "residents" need to seriously get laid.
