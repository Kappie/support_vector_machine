And I was already happy before that because today in English my contact fell out and so during lunch I called my mom to ask her to bring me one so I could see driving home AND she said my PACEs had just arrived when I called.  I am such a dork.  I am so excited about homeschool.  How often do you hear a kid say that???? Not often.  I am very irritated.  As you know if you read through all my pet peeves (apparently a difficult task), you would know that I absolutely ABHOR being told GOOD JOB in PE.  well anyways after dodgeball in PE today all the guys said GOOD JOB Dustin!  It was NOT a good job!!!  I was a total klutz.  Now on a day I actually participate I do not mind Nice try or something to that effect but NEVER can anything I EVER do in PE be considered a GOOD JOB!!!  Oh almost forgot that I have to make a list of 100 things I like. I think I will make that a seperate post.  BTW Jess you can find my web journal at http://triquetta17.blogspot.com
