Went to buy yanping's birthday present. Got her a nice necklace. Heard her voice in the Woodlands library ( she called chrispin to buy a tuner). Hao xinfu wor~~!! Haha. I'm starting to get frightened liao...wat if my happiness is suddenly snatched away from me? I'm afraid that i can not stand up again. I feel like i'm being toyed around. By her!! But nevermind...i'm WILLING to be toyed around. You must be wondering why am i such a fool...You will never understand..unless you are in my shoes.... I'm scared.
