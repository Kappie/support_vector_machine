You know the kind I am talking about when everything you do isn't good enough for anyone and there is always someone who can make sure you don't forget your a fuck up right. Well that was my day and that someone is my sister. My day started off ok. I went to work I did my job. Then my coworker didn't do her job and clocked out before anyone checked her area so guess what I had to do my fucking job and hers. Then I came home and my loving fucking sister was her. We got into and she told me I shouldn't give a damn about shanna because she was going to leave me just like my father did and jsut like Katy did. Thanks Summer I am always glad when you fuck my day up.Way to go!! I don't know what I would do without you to fuck up all my happiness. Can u see i am HAPPY with Shanna. Ryan and I will never be together. IT doesn't matter what you say though because you never understood me and u never will because you don't see who I am you just see what you want to. In the words of MELISSA ETHRIDGE WHO GIVES A DAMN WHAT THEY SAY WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS LOVE ANYWAY. SO all you who want to fuck with my happiness practice safe sex and screw yourselves.
