Well I had this dream that I lived in the house with the girl from that and the devil kept trying to get her so her mother had to rush her out of the house and she had to go in the sewer to try to be safe from him haha. My older sister lived in the house with me and we were scared that the devil was going to try to get us so we kept staying in rooms together. She was getting ready for bed and I had to follow her all around the house so I wouldn't be alone so the devil couldn't get me or her. I dragged all my stuffed animals around like a little kid too haha.It was scary cuz everything was all dark and we both kept randomly hearing growling noises haha. What a weird mind I haveeee.   Then I had another dream that it was my ex boyfriend's birthday party and me and Erin were invited and we went and ignored him the whole time and didn't get him a present and fucked around with other people there. How do I have a dream about satan and then a birthday party ignoring someone? Blehness.   Then I woke upof course and was up at 6:30 in the morning=(   Congrats on sleeping patternAdi =D   Bai
