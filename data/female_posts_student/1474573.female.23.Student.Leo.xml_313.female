However, sometimes one has to be smacked in the face by something in order to truly see it for what it is.  As any of us that left or are still in the poetry scene know, its that there is an apparent heirarchy and an elitism not unlike High School.  Here is my pecking order:  1. There are the cool 'kids' that everyone wants to be around.   2. There are the newbies who are willingly kissing the asses of the cool kids but who will never become cool because they are not respected.    3. There are people that came onto the scene with awe, became accepted by their elders and then went on an ego trip never to come back.  4. There are also newbies that appreciate the scene and are doing well in it, gaining the respect of their 'elders' but not quite succumbing to the spotlight.   5. There are people that have been around for awhile, but have never quite have been accepted by the cool kids despite their efforts, or how many times they win a slam, they just can never quite get there.  6. There are people that were once the kinda cool kids that were actually nice to almost everyone then realized that not everyone was like them...they come out of the spotlight and move on to bigger and better things.  I tend to have more respect for the latter three.  Nothing is worse than being in a community that has a facade of being something it's not.  That realization can hurt like a motherfucker.  It's like, do you play the game and stay there, or do you walk away?  I walked away, but I wouldn't consider myself a poet or a writer.  I wasn't affected financially and socially when I walked away.  It wasn't my game to play.    D, I feel for you.  Let it all go.  Move on.
