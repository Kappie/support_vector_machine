Even the Indians are complaining about how hot it is.  So, a little recap...it turns out that we actually have very little to do with the hospital. We are working only with the school. This week we had the nursery through grade one kids, also known as 3-5 year olds. They are a challenging age to work with. Plus there were 190 of them. We perservered, and they are all now our best friends...he he. Today was our last day with them.  We also do nightly devotions with the children who board at the school, there are about 40 of them. Oh, and for the next two weeks we'll be doing a short devotion at morning excercises for the school. Mark is speaking at church on sunday, and we'll be doing the sunday school in the morning. So they are keeping us very busy.The food here is excellent. We are being personally looked after by the principal's wife, and she watches over us while we eat. Meals consist mostly of some type of rice, some type of spicey potatoe dish, a spicey sauce, and variations on flat bread that helps us to pick up the food and put in our mouthes. We only use utensils for cereal in the morning. I think we're all getting quite good at eating with our hands.  Health of our group has been pretty good. Brian was pretty sick shortly after we arrived here. He had a tropical virus and isn't up to 100% yet, but he is close. We are fortunate to be so close to a hospital. Alaina's stomache hasn't been that well and she spent a day in bed, but she presses on and dances her face off for the kids. I think most of the rest of us are tired and have had our moments of international indigestion, but nothing has been too serious.  We are looking forward to working with slightly older kids who will understand english (or even hindi), and we will no longer need to be interpreted.  Well, I have to pee. I am having fun. I am glad to be here.  If anyone from the Pit is reading...send my parents my paycheque, or my rent cheque for august will bounce!! and have you found my other shoe...suckers!  Love for all...I miss your hugs..(not that the hugs of those here are not sufficient, but i have little holes that can only be filled by certain people's hugs)  Laura aka LStew
