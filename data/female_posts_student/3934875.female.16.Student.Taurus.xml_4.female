Wishing you were here right now     To share this gracious day.     Wishing you were here with me     And wipe these tears away.       I wish so much that I could see     And hold and have you near.     Theres nothing what I wouldnt give     How i wish i had you here.       It doesnt matter how long the time     Has past since you've been gone     Only God knows deep in my heart     My love for you lives on.       You understood and guided me     Every step along the way.     You told me to be patient with life     But you werent here to stay.       You gave me peace to conquer     All my sadness and all my tears.     You said 'one day we'll meet again'     And i wont need to wish you were here.     I love you, yayi..     Forever...
