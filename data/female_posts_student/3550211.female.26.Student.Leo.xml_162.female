On a normal everyday basis, things are difficult. But survivable. I manage. I work the corporate 9 to 5. Breaking my back for the man, so I can pay the rent, put some food on the table, and you know, have electricity. Lights, are after all, are a good thing. And just what would I do without my trusty computer? There's a scary thought. In fact, I'd rather not even think about it. However, the most frustrating element, due to this situation, is the car factor. Yes. The car factor. The fact that my car is not only a hunk of junk, but that it is held together by duct tape. Yes. Duct tape.  Here's the generic duct tape schpiel:  Well, that’s why God made duct tape. Or rather why He set in motion the chain of events that made inert chemicals spark with life, embark on a long process that yielded ever-complex organisms that one day would develop, market, and purchase duct tape. We’ll live with it.   You've got to love duct tape, eh.  Anyway, it's quite evident that I am in need of a new car. I've been trying to save money, which has turned out to be a pathetic attempt by the way. It's impossible to save money when every dime you earn is needed to just - survive. However, I thought my luck had changed, when for my birthday, my aunt sent me a gift in the form of a considerably good sized check. So there I was. My arm stretched out. Hand open. Reaching with the tips of my fingers. Grasping to hold on to the dream of a shiny brand new car ...  In a matter of three days, circumstances, have taken a turn for the worse. My rent was raised. My health insurance is changing from a HMO to a PPO, which means that I now have to pay a $1000.00 deductible, at the very least. And now, for some unknown reason, my financial aid has been dropped. This means I owe the school  a lot  of money by next Tuesday. This also means, good bye new car.  Lucky school though. They were the recipient of some very explicit emails last night. And today, oh boy, are they going to be surprised when I show up and start making a scene. Ahahha. Oh yes. This can actually turn out fun yet.      Dear diary, my twenty-something angst bullshit has a body count I believe it's 6 going on 7 now. I've been dreaming about you, in a pool of your own blood, with your eyes gouged out by the work of my thumbs. The scent of your insides from under the floorboards, the perfect perfume to settle a score.  Ride the wings of pestilence.
