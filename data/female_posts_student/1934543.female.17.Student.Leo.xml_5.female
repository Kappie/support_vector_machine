So now you can also change some stuff if you would like to.:-)  Good morning/ good night  It is about nine in the morning and i just got up so i can barely hold my eyes open but i am trying hard. I got myself out of bed that early because i was kinda hoping that holliejo would still be on but she aint. Thats alright i guess because she wrote in the blog.  First things first. I wont get together with that girlfriend again. I thought about that last night and i figured that it just wouldnt be right and so i am not gonna be with that girl anymore/never ever again. I dont know if that makes hollie happy but it sure makes me happy because no i can worry about other things and dont have to think about my lousy relationship with that girl. For the next months you can also be sure that i wont get a gf.So nothingto worry about and if holliejo finds someone that perfectly fits to her she can always tell me because i will be really happy for her. Because hollie needs a guy that stays with her no matter what, that can deal with her time to time attitude problems and crazyness, and can handle all the power that shes got. I know this sounds really hard, but someone that will really love her will be able to handle all those problems and still be able to smile all the time just like hollie herself. WEll i kinda gotta get some breakfast in so i wish you all a good night and take care until the morning.  Lovelots German
