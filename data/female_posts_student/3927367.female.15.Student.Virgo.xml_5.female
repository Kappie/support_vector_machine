I was the little fish that, when introducing himself to nemo, says "I'm obnoxious!" Yeah, that name is pretty self explanatory i guess.  Well, last night was the worst night ican ever remember having, hands-down. It was ok to begin with, we had dinner, the little kids didn't scream which was a first. Then my little sister who is 11 got invited to go sleep over at a friends house. My grandparents said ok, so she went her way. However, with her gone that meant that i had to do two paper routes this morning: hers and mine. Usually my mom does both routes with us, but she was gone, so my grandpa was gonna do it. That meant that I would have to run to every house. (we drive the routes in a car. Lazy, i know, but it gets it done faster.) Oh well, i decided, at least my little sister would be having fun. And so the night progressed onward. Generally the kids go to bed at 9 or 9:30. Last night they didn't go to bed until 11:00, all because my grandparents had put on a 2 hour movie and the kids wouldn't go to bed until the end of it. I didn't really mind. I thought the more tired they are the easier they'll go to sleep. I was wrong. Dead wrong.  To put the kids to bed some one has to read three stories, sing three songs, and say prayers with them. Well, that someone is my mom who gives into them a lot, and only because both boys are autistic and half deaf. Autistic or not, they are extremely intelligent and should not be treated like babies. They're 6 1/2 for crying aloud! I told them last night that i would read stories to them in the morning, when i could actually focus my eyes to read. Bryce was ok with that, he just read himself a story, sang a song, said prayers, and went to sleep. Chase totally went to pieces. He was screaming for mom and refused to go to sleep until she came home. She doesn't get home until tonight, around 6. So i told him whatever, i don't care, sleep on the floor with all your toys, it really doesn't matter to me. So he slept on the floor for about 30 minutes, then crawled in his bed. I won that battle easily enough. Then there is Hannah. There is nothing wrong with her, except an extreme attitude that needs adjusting. I read her book but would notheat up the rice pack for her. Why in the world does she need it anyways? Oh. That's right, she doesn't! Well, she did this cry/whining combo that i could not stand. I turned around and started walking toward the door. All of a sudden both Hannah and Chase start crying and screaming that they hate me. For some reason it really hurt. I closed the door, laid on my parents bed, turned on my music and tried to tune them out.  Around midnight Hannah gets up and says she has to go to the bathroom, so i take her. Then she automatically thinks that she gets to sleep in my parents bed with me. My mom evidently lets her sleep with them, but i'm not my mom. I told her no, and she started her whole cry/whining thing again. I can't stand that cry because it is so fake, honestly, it is. It's all for show. I put her backin her bed where she commenced to cry for another 15 minutes, and then fell silent.  All in all, last night was absolutely terrible. Tonight when my parents come home i am not gonna help with the kids at all. I must say I am so sick of them. I have been stuck at home for the past 10 days straight, with only them for company. I have only left the house to go to the dentist and my paper route. Oh well. That's all in the past. This next week, starting on Monday, the drumline is coming over to my house and we are gonna be painting our drums. It's supposed to be around 103 all next week, and we're gonna be inmy garage, but it'll be fun.  Well, today is a new day, with new chores and responsibilities. I have to clean the downstairs, bathroom, and upstairs, not to mention run to the store and get some groceries, paint brushes and tape. I have to do this by 1 because that's when the drumline rehearsal begins. I gotta get crackin'. Keep on keepin on.
