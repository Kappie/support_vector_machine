RFC is now providing pre-paid shipping labels online so it costs you nothing to donate your old gadgets to be refurbished and then redistributed.   RFC says that by 2006, 85,000 tons of cell phones will be trashed. That's about 180 million cell phones, all full of potentially toxic metals. Don't add yours to the landfill pile. To print your own shipping labels, donate to the cause, or just find out more about RFC, please visit  urlLink Recyling for Charity .
