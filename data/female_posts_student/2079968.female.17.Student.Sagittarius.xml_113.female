Thought I'd share:  "But rise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things which I will yet reveal to you." --Acts 26:16  I found it encouraging...daily I begin to realize more and more my purpose for this life :-)
