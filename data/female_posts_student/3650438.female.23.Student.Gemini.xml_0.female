Well today is June 17th, notoriously the day that OJ Simpson took off on a low speed car chase.  This year, the day Martha Stewart is sentenced.  It's also my birthday, but the truth is, I don't have much to write about since my birthday was, thus far, pretty uneventful.  Which is fine, at 23 you just don't need all the hoopla accompanying previous birthdays.    I was thinking back, trying to decide what was my favorite birthday.  It's pretty hard, I don't really remember a lot of them, but I guess my favorite one was when I turned 18.  I've spent a lot of time recently reflecting on that time in my life, I just attended my brother and cousin's graduations, and I did get a feel again of that essence I felt at that momment of my life.  In a word, carefree probably describes it best.  It really was great to enjoy that graduation without the impeding burden of repaying student loans.
