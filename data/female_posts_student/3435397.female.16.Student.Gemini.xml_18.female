LOL anyways today in math was the funniest thing ever!!! I was at the back of the room looking at my marks when I got pushed my Brendan Hoordichuck.  Then Chris started pushing me not big deal and I was like everything you push me I am going to push Brendan. After a few minutes Brendan didn't even look at me and punched me and hit me right in the boob! I was in so much pain and was laughing so hard my eyes filled up with tears! At first he was laughing because he thought I was Ryan Wild well sorry Brendan he doesn't have bob's! He looked at me after a while and had this shocked look on his face and then just started saying sorry over and over again all class.  Chris was shocked too I think so was I! It was so funny I don't think I laughed so hard in my life!  It was funny! I tried to hit him a few times today but I feel bad hitting people and I am not strong enough! LOL! But I must say I kind enjoyed the hug I got when he was saying sorry! OH! He also said after he thought that he didn't hit Wild because I was to soft! LOL! It was pretty funny!Ashley I got to see his hot tummy and you didn't! LOL SUCKER!!!! Anyway Later Gator
