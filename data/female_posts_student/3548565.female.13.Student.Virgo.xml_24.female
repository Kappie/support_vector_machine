The other one is Joanne, my classmate, who is now, also my vice secretary. So....=) That's pretty much the good news so far. I had quite an OK time in school for GERKO this morning. 
 Having Girls' Brigade enrolment on the 24th of this month. Ouch, and we haven't even started practicing our drill!!! Oh well. -_- I guess we'll be fine. As long as we all stay fit and no one passes out during practices and on enrolment day. I hate it when that happens!! Esp in school. :P But then again, lucky me, I'm never gonna be one of those RC ppl who have to stand and help anyone who faints or feel sick during assemblies. :P  Connie was steaming mad yesterday when I saw her in school cos she said the teacher (RC teacher) forced her to come for the RC exam. But she had to go for ballet practice for tonight's performance from 8 or 10 (somewhere there) to 1 pm, then she was asked to come to school from 2 to 3 for her RC exam, then she had to go back home and eat and take her bath then go to the city hall (uh...or so I think) to get ready for her performance before 5. I have to say that's a really tight schedule. But she decided to not go for the RC exam, and she said she is finally quitting RC. She's been talking about quitting lately, but she never got around to really doing it. But I guess it's final now. :P Neways, Chia Hsin or should I say, RACHEL...and I are going to Connie's performance tonight. :) Rach's picking me up at 6.30 pm. It's 6 now. Guess I better go get ready. :) See ya bloggie!  --Crystal--
