No, it wasn't that snotty Kate who almost exactlyafter I finished typing to you was a complete jerk to me. Nope, it was my twin sister, Nicole. Now, I don't understand what's the big deal of having your twin sister as your very best friend. Everyone always looks at us weirdly because we are so close. They just don't understand, Cole and I have been through so much together. When the entire fourth grade, including our teacher, picked on us terribly, we were the only friends that eachother had. When my mom tried to kill my dad and all, Nicole (and Nick) was there for me and I was there for her (and him.) Is it such a crime these days to have a family member as your best friend? My school is quite against twins spending time together. They put you in completely different classes. In soccer last year, my coach forbade Nicole and I to pick one another for partners. That was like totally UNFAIR. I mean, come on, all the other girls got to pair up with their best friends. Why couldn't we? Besides, I hated a lot of the girls on our team. Half of them were stuck up and the other half were mean...  Anyways, back to the subject... I had been avoiding telling my sister who I really, really like or in other words who I have a little bit of love for. Shh!! Pretend I didn't say that last part, okay? Anyhow, Nicole totally knew that I was trying to edge away from the subject. So, she started guessing. She said my crush's name like a thousand times, but each time I said no, I didn't have any feelings for him at all. (OMG, Ireally needto work on telling the truth for once.)Today, after weeks of endless questionings, she found out... Okay, we were in a secreted place where no one can really hear us and she was asking me a million questions all at once. She kept asking me things about him which I totally avoided answering. Finally she got fed up with me and said that she wouldn't speak to me at all until I told her who I liked. Well, I couldn't stand the silence so I gave in. She got really, really excited and happy... She kept saying over and over again on how she thought that was who I liked (or loved). She was like OMGing every few seconds. See, she was totally OMGing 'cause I reallyliked this person beforehand, then I didn't really 'cause I thought he was a big prat, and now I really, really like him... Do you have any idea on what I'm talking about? No? Well, it's one of those love/hate thingys... One minute I disgrace the land that he walks upon and the next moment Ipractically worship him.Uh, well, it's not exactly like that... I don'treally ever truly hate the land he walks upon or worship him totally... You know what I mean, right?  Anyhow, it feels wonderful, having someone know who I like. I've kept this secret bottled inside of mefor like a year or two. It's a huge relief to finally tell someone, you can say... Oh, I really hope he likes me... He used to like me, at least that's what my sister said.My sister and Ihaven't seen him in awhile so we couldn't exactly tell if he likes me now. Oh, I wish he did. I like him  SOOOOO  much; just don't tell him that. What happens if he hates me? I bet he doesn't like me... I don't think he even realises that I exist. AH!!!! That would be such a nightmare... He's seen me before, uh, at least Ihope he has...Wait, what am Ityping? He's seen me before.Honestly, I am such a liar. I really need to work onmy honesty. On here, I haven't lied to you yet. Well, except just a few lines back, but I admitted I lied so that's not the same...  Ah, I wonder if he likes me. Does he like me? Does he evenknowthat I exist? Should I ask him out? (What am I thinking with that one? I'll never ask him out, I'm such a wimp!) Will he ask me out?(I don't know where that one came from either...)   Well, I've got lots to wonder about at the moment. I'll be leaving you know.   Austa!
