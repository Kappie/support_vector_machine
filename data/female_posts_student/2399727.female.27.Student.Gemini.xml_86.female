Seems  urlLink grieving the loss of vision is just like grieving the loss of a loved one , according to the stages as laid out by  urlLink Kubler-Ross .  He seemed pretty eager to talk to me more about it further.  Not sure if I'm willing to do that or not; might just open up an emotional floodgate I've been good at suppressing so far.  More to come...
