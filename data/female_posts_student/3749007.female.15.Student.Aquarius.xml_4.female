Yeah, so..anyways...we're both into old rock right now...which, btw, is so cool!!! And we went on for a long while taking turns asking each other if they liked ____ or _____. Well, come to find out...He likes Bread!!!! OMG!!! I love it!!! Yeah, so I'm a little biased b/c I was named after one of their songs...but still..how many of you can say you were named after a song..??? Answer me ..write me a comment and tell me if you're named after a song...I'm serious....and I'm talking first name.. So...yeah..it really shocked me that this guy not only knows this,that I'm named after this song...but actually likes it...he likes my song...and he actually has listened to it...and has the CD!!! Craziness...!!! Honestly,I don't think I'll ever forget it..but what would truly be kinda a dream come true, is, say..for some reason or another, if we did start dating,...and it just happened to be the two of us..just me  him,...and we were cuddling...and it was late..and dark...and I was almost asleep,..and he starts whispering the song...singing it..in this quiet, hushed kinda voice...just looking into my eyes...you know, where I could see that he really cared...that he had love in his eyes... Ahh..but then again,..it's just a dream...  Lover Boy-- If you're out there, and you happen to stumble across this...that's a not-so-hidden little hint for you...But PLEASE!!! Don't ruin my dream!!! If you are out there,..and you do decide to do that...make it the right moment...make it romantic...and don't do it until you're sure that it'd make me happy...so, I guess I'm saying for you to wait a good long while before you attempt it...Make it just right..PLEASE!!!   Anyways..just my far-fetched mind dreaming up what would be great... *Sighs*  Well, just wanted to say that I love you all...very muchly..  --Aub
