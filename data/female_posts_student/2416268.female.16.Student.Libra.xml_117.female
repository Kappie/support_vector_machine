Again another beautiful evening draws in and a million thoughts are with me again, none of which make much sense or are relevant to each other, but they are there, and will always be there!!   Now we have finished school I seem to have more of my own thoughts, I am no longer thinking about what I need to think about, but what I want to think about! Well I mean I did think about what I wanted to think about, but there were also things that I didn’t, ok so those thoughts were less than my thoughts, but now I have even more space for my thinking!! That could be a dangerous thing, letting me have time to think, as it is I think far too much!!  I was thinking today, isn’t it weird how there are so many people in this world, and we only meet a fraction of them! I wonder if we meet some of the people we do because of coincidence or fate? I don’t know. I’m not a huge believer in the destiny being mapped out in the stars, and I am not a huge believer in fate, but I do have to question things sometimes! Like was that coincidence, and sometimes it seems as though it is not, that it is some sort of fate….Oh I don’t know……..and I suppose that’s part of the mystery that is life, and we’re not supposed to know…………  Anyway, I am off now, to go and think so more, before reading my book!!!  Love to y’all Nat
