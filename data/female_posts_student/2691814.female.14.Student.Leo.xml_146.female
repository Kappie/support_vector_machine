We just hung out and watched some shows with Ryan Gosling...he's hot..:) He's in the movie The Notebook...and i have got to see it. So anyway, ya, we talked and looked at pictures and just, normal stuff. No news on going to wv yet, grrr, we called justin, no answer..so he'll probably call us today. *sigh*
