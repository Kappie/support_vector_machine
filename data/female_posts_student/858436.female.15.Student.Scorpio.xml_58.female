And then she ripped Luke's hoodie on accident. It was pretty funny. I was freaking blushed (more like turned into a tomato) again for no reason! And Goodson was cracking up. SO not funny! Hehe. Haley, I'm not quite sure that this plan worked out so well. *cringe* Hehe it was funny though. ;-) And I'm Snory (rhymes with Story) in the Sleepytime Club! Thanks, Beth! Yeah!  Oh yeah yesterday was a snow day! It was nice, but Charles was home. Ugh. He was sent home because he has pinkeye. It's looking better now. I bet that sucks.   Hm.. well it's 11:30 and I haven't eaten since 6th hour today, so I'm kinda starving. Gotta go get some food..
