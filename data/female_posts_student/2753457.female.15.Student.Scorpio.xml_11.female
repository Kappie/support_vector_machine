Yeah, today's gonna be AWESOME. Last night actually was pretty enjoyable once people got there.  At first it was like, hey guys, we're stupid freshmen.  But it got better; it's always like that.  Even though the idea behind it was a good one, the coat check system sucked.  They didn't even call my number for God's sake.  They just waved my things around until I saw them and took them away.  But yeah, we went to Shabashabu for dinner before Enloe, which is always a rewarding experience for me.  I love that place.  And everyone looked really nice.  I should've done something different with my hair, but it just looked extra straight.  That is, until I got sweaty and gross.  Hanna and I took off our shoes and hid them behind one of the curtains, hahaha.  I have no regrets, other than the sight of my feet afterwards.  Yuck. Well, my mom and sister got back from their eight mile walk (and I'm not even exaggerating or making a pun.  They always do stuff like that.) and wanted me go to Wellspring with them.  I said I had to get started on all my reading, which is kind of true.  I mean, I definitely could have gone, but I didn't want to. Ok, I just realized that it's really cold in here.  Ahhhh, must turn up the heat.  Laters.
