Too bad it's supposed to get cold again on Monday.    Matt and I went on a mini-date to the Arboretum and took a long, relaxing walk.  It was nice.  Now I have to work on prelim stuff, which is always a joy.  I think Matt is watching football and napping, which are perfect activities for a day like today.    Dave G. introduced me to the world of Skype yesterday.  It's a program on which you can actually talk over the net.  It seemed to work pretty well, although it's not Mac compatible so I can only use it when I'm at the office.  I don't know who I would talk to other than Dave, anyway.    While I don't have time to do things outside of school work, I think I do need to start finding things to do with myself at least a couple evenings a week.  Sitting alone in my apartment just waiting for people to get on IM seems a rather sorry existence.  And doesn't necessarily help my sanity.  But what else is there?  Going out to a bar by myself may end up being even less healthy...  Hmm....
