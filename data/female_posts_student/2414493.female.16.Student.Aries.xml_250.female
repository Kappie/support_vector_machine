Everything about your friends is what their parents do or how they did on the SATs and "Are they a good student?" God damnit, it's not like I really get along with people who aren't (here I have to laugh) and I've been like that for 16 whole years. It's just disgusting how one of the first conversational things I hear from Mom when I get home is, "How did Ellis do on his tests?"  Mom, you've got it all wrong. All wrong.  You know what, I worked hard for what I did, but in the end, it's all for me. Sure, I'm happy, but that gives you no right to derive sadistic pleasure into telling everyone else that I did well. I really don't give a damn when it comes to everybody else's reactions and would prefer to hold personal test score information from the Asian mother community. Like at breakfast! There's nothing like pretention to turn somebody off. Can't you please have a civil conversation without mentioning TEST SCORES?  You know, they tell us to get lives. I think they should direct that toward the Asian mothers.   It's just so wrong how people are walking, talking three-digit numbers, all multiples of ten at that. Tiff can't really go out now. Nimo's downed by a ridiculously low 720, imagine that. Ok, so I'm done but so what? It's for personal gratification, and, as an extension of that, a way to keep the parents off my back. I really don't give a shit what other people think about my test scores as long as they leave me alone.  (Abruptly removed from soapbox.) Talking, what else?
