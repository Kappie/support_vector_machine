I am never getting married, I mean really, I don't want my husband to kill me. ;)  Just kidding, I can't wait till me wedding.  it will be fun! I don't really want to get married but I want to have the wedding! My wedding is gonna be hugeeeee. It will be great! You are all invited! :)  Tonight is quite boring. My brothers are loading the van so they can leave first thing tomorrow morning.  We (mum, dad, Hannah, and I) will have to drive my grandpas jaguar. Sad ;) I am quite excited though.   But tomorrow I have to go to church..With braces. Whenever I go anywhere in public I am SO insecure. I have never been this insecure in my life. Its disgusting.  *sigh*  But I get to go shopping in Portland for a swim suit...and maybe summer clothes..but I haven't found any goood summer clothes..so who knows :)  I need a fathers day gift too..hmm. My funds are quickly depleting!
