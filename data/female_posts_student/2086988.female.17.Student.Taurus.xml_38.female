I sometimes feel as though there is no one out there to talk to, to tell them how I really feel, what's the point? They're not going to understand. And everyday it gets worse, I just want them to go away, I hate feeling this way, it's not me. Yeah, I can hide if from people, still be the same hyper, freaking bouncing off the walls me, with all my dumb jokes. But deep down I don't feel that way, I feel alone, empty, quiet, yes I must say that I do get depressed, and there's nothing I can do about it. I hate feeling like there is nothing there, or that time is going way too slow, I know it's just for now, these feelings will fade, but I guess sometimes I get scared that things might not work out the same way as planned. I'm afraid to lose something really great because I can't be there...   Everyone is just the same
