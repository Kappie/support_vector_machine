I've been reading for the past hour about this truely wonderful young ladie named Kebra. Her father gave a speech about her at her funeral. Everyone please read.      This is the speech her Daddy gave at Keb's funeral I want to tell you what I loved about my daughter Kebra. Kebbie loved animals, of any shape or size. Kebra sealed the deal to build our home on Pecan Hollow in 1990, when she saw horses standing at the fence behind the lot and wouldn’t leave them alone. The horses vaporized within months to make way for more new houses, but our house and family remain. She loved our dogs Hoss and Blue, but Keb especially loved our cats Polo and Riley, which she arbitrarily decided one day to rename Paco and Rico. I hope she remembers to look up our original golden retriever Sam in dog heaven--the kids and I cried together on the couch for hours when Sam died shortly after the divorce. Kebra had Camo, a Camelion she affectionately raised from a “pup”, stalking the neighborhood flower beds with Camo dangling from a finger snagging any bug she’d point him towards. Ben Stiller was her favorite actor, and Old School was one of her favorite movies. She was a Halo expert, and a pool shark. Kebra loved Sushi. She was the only girl I’ve ever known who loved Unagi...tasty eel. She loved Smoothies, and Sonic. She loved Anamia’s, and by some chance fortitude she and I went there alone the Friday before she died, just a nice father-daughter dinner, but something I can’t remember if ever did before. Usually it was together with family and lots of friends--but that night the Stars lined up right and she and I got some time together to talk about life. Kebra loved sports, and especially soccer. At that dinner she talked about how much she was looking forward to her new soccer club Solar, and our tournament this weekend in NY. She talked about how hard it was to leave her old club Infinity, and all the friends she’d miss. She talked about Hi School soccer, and how she wasn’t just going to make varsity, but she was going to force Stricker to make her a starter. I loved watching her play soccer; she wasn’t the best player on the field--only the toughest and most determined. She talked about her dreams of playing college soccer one day, and I told her she’d make it happen. Truthfully, her gift athletically was probably as a long distance runner. She hated to run because she got so nervous before races--but once the gun sounded she became a fierce competitor, as the 1st place ribbons in her closet attest. But really, she may have missed her calling in Hockey. All of us in the neighborhood, myself included, used to play street hockey. Because she was one of the youngest at 6 or 7, and of course, “JUST A GIRL”, we stuck her in goal ... big mistake cuz she became the GIRL WALL. When she’d finally get tired of getting shot at and not getting to skate up front with the boys, she’d just storm off... making the game that much less challenging, and fun. She loved her name KEBRA. And any time someone mispronounced it KEEbra or KAYbra she was quick to correct them with a sharp--”IT’S KEBRA” She could be just as Sassy after I chewed her butt for forgetting her chores or not picking up by telling me, “Dad, I don’t need any more of your SASS...” and then she’d flash me that big beautiful smile. Now that I’ve told you what I loved about Kebra’s life, let me tell you what I hate about her death. We are slowly coming to grips with the fact that she took her own life, whether intentionally or unintentionally. And for those of you who think even the threat of suicide is a solution to the pain and anguish you suffer throughout life, and especially high school, it’s NOT. All it does is compound your pain a hundred fold, and forever more transfers it to those around you who love you. I loved Kebra deeply, and I know she loved me the same way, and yet she’s put me and her family over the past few days through the 3 hardest things we have been through in life... Again, I want to make sure all you kids hear the importance of my message now, although it’s not pleasant and will forever haunt our memory of her. The first was her death itself. The days leading up to Thursday were difficult, as she felt--like you ALL do oftentimes in high school--alienated from friends. Kebra spent the final hours of her life sneaking out of the house, and drinking some beers with friends, and ultimately getting in an argument with us. She went upstairs around 4am, and made a decision and a mistake that can’t be reversed. Those of you involved, PLEASE don’t feel at fault--these issues and conflicts are a natural part of life you ALL deal with at times--Kebra was able to make up her own mind, and just made a wrong decision. She knew everything she had to live for, but her decision that night was clearly impaired by alcohol, and that’s something we all now have to live with. A week ago had you asked me I would have said, “A few beers?...it’s no big deal.” Tragically, we learned the hard way how destructive alcohol can be. If you take one thing from her death, decide right now to not drink alcohol. And for those of you who think taking pills or drugs are a quick and painless way out of your anguish--consider the real effects. As Mel frantically tried to get the ambulance to hurry, I held my daughter in her bed and tried to think what to do. Her strong body was racked with painful seizures, she was throwing up blood and biting her tongue and beautiful lips, and all I could do was turn her on her side and wait for the help that never got there before she gasped her last dozen or so struggling breaths. Kebra died in my arms at 4:25am as the Ambulance arrived, but I didn’t realize or believe it for the next hour or so--I thought for sure the EMTs or ER team would bring my girl back without fail. Sadly, it’s not like it is on TV. The second most difficult thing I’ve ever done was picking out her cemetary plot. How do you go about selecting your child’s final resting place, when you haven’t even selected your own? I suspect Kebra didn’t stop to foresee Dad and her family straggling through cemetaries trying to find her “perfect spot”. And by the way, her perfect spot is at home--anywhere else is awful. The third most difficult chore we’ll ever tackle will come at the conclusion of these services. With the finality of her burial, we will start the process of burying Kebra’s dreams and living through everything she’ll miss throughout life. Homecoming. Prom. 72 more high school boyfriends. Winning the 5A State Cross Country title, then coming back in the Spring and scoring the winning goal in the soccer State Championship. Her 1st car, the older model Ford Bronco she’s talked about for a year, and which she’d likely wreck in about a month. Then her next car, the new Mazda RX8 I told her I’d buy--of course after she totalled the Bronco. High School Graduation. Sorority Rush, and pledging Pi Phi. Scoring the winning goal for Nebraska in the NCAA Championship vs. Duke. College graduation, and her first job opening a Vet Clinic. Marriage to AJ, complete with her $200,000 dream wedding. Grandkids--twin boys Chandler Richard and Christopher Richard. All of these dreams and conquests were ahead of her, but they were vanquished overnight because of one senseless mistake. Taking your own life is never the answer to your problems--it is just a way to create more. If you loved Kebra, my home and my phone will always be open for you, and I want you to raise your hand right now if you will take that invitation if and when you get in trouble. Good--before you go down a path that hurts so many around you--call me or come by. We can talk, or you can just sit in Kebbs room and be with her. And before I finsh, I want to issue everyone in this room today a challenge. As a family, we refuse to let our darling Kebra’s heart and soul vanish with her death. Sometime in the next year--go out of your way to do something special to positively impact someone’s life around you. Just like Kebb did when she lit up a room with her smile and inspired everyone, or did something nice for a friend or teammate, or went out of the way to be there for you when you most needed her--we ask that you do the same in Kebb’s memory. And when you do, please call to tell us, or come by, or just post how you feel on her website. Kebra has already had a profound influence on my life--I took my last drink of alcohol the evening before she passed away. And anyone who knew me before Kebbs death knows I was not a devoutly religious person. I still have many unanswered questions, and know it will be next to impossible to become the good Christian she was. However, I’m going to commit to try.......I have to know that we’ll all see Kebra’s brilliant smile once again when we see her in heaven.      This has touched in the most pasionate way. I just want to become a better person because of this one girl. I want to never say I hate someone or anything. This just shows how short life really is. As of tonight. I have had the most change in heart. And I want to show it. All because of this one girl. Because of what happend to her. It just brings me to tears because I have wanted to end my life so many times. But now it has all changed I know how it would effect my family and friends. And I think god and Kebra for leting me come across something like this. I will never forget reading what her father had to say. It will stay in my memory. My god bless her family and have her watch over people she loves and that love her.
