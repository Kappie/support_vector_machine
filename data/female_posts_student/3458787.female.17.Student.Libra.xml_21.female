The drive was pretty smooth- avoided a few monitor lizards with a few smooth turns and swerves, over took a couple of slow moving lorries and took a steady speed of about 100Km/hr in the almost deserted Expressway.  I was siting beind my Dad who was driving- happily chatting and critising the songs that were being played on the radio while munching on some pringles potato chips.   The road was becoming a little bad. They were doing some repair works here and there but nothing terribly worrying or delay causing.   Suddenly there was a light blue car just in front of us. Why was it not moving? Or was it moving very slowing? It was too near for comfort. My Dad pressed onto the breaks. Our car screeched. We were slowed down drastically but had not stopped yet. Why were we not stopping?! My mind went blank. BANG!  No one was injured luckly(seat belts did their job well). The light blue car's bumper was a little smashed but nothing that $200 could not fix. Nothing much happened to our car except that our number plate had been smashed and had 3 large cracks on it.  It was a close call- an experience to remember for a long long time to come!
