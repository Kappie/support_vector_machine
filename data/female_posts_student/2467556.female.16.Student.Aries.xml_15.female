I had almost no homework to work on, i had nowhere to go, i didn't really want to do anything and i just sat at home.  I sat at home and slept, talked on the phone a little bit, talked online a little bit and ate.  It was good.  Yeah, today was my dad's bday dinner....it was boring and i had to eat enchiladas (blech!).  And BRITTNEE was impossible to get a hold of to tell her something IMPORTANT, but yeah whatever.  Isn't today somebody's birthday?? i keep on feeling like i'm forgetting someone's birthday but i can't remember whose it was.....well if it was your birthday today, December 13th, then tell me and i'm terribly sorry i forgot.  And then i'll send you a bday email card thing and wish you the best of bdays, :)    Omg, i am soooo tired.  I want school to end right now or i want to skip a grade and be a senior wth literally no homework.  I still have to semi-study for that stupid BCIS test.  BCIS is a computer class for those that didn't know.  I swear that class has made me start to hate computer...but then without computers there's alot of things i would be without.    Ok and now, i am going to go eat some of my dad's birthday cake and then go to sleep, no partying tonight.  ~~~Taylor~~~
