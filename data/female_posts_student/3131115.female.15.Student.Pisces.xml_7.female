I'm actually sad, because it seems as if they're not happy. Niblikitosh is hiding under the carpet, and Tizzy is trying to climb out of his tank. Maybe after a while they'll calm down and not scurry every time I put my hand in there to clean up their..yes, that. William got off the phone with me a few minutes ago, and I'm feeling lonely as I stated before. Nobody to talk to, Nobody to care, etc etc. I'm feeling sorry for myself, something I do an awful lot these days. If only I could be a little less of a fuck up, and a wee-bit more intelligent...things might be better. *might* key word.   Tizzy is now trying to get under the carpet with Niblikitosh. Hmm..It's quite sad that when I have nothing to think about I look to the iguanas for amuzement. ~blah~ Self pity..once again. GO AWAY! I haven't worked on my web page in a while..hmm, I forgot about that until now. That was the main thing that kept me busy when I was sitting home by myself.:then too..feeling pity for myself: Now I mainly concentrate on this. ---It's too early to go to bed. I want to sleep, I need to sleep but for some reason Im afraid. I love having a mind..it's what makes me unique +even though I rarely use it+ but thats beside the point...I love having one, but..it thinks too much when I DONT WANT IT TO!   Âhhh! Bored out of my mind. I'm writing too much. Paranoid...Im paranoid! Chill out you beast. Im chill. _Anyhow_-I have nothing left to say. Im thinking about...water. Water sounds great. Im going to go get myself a \COLD/ glass of water.     yummy...
