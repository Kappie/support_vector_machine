More good news; the   urlLink Amazing Race   is coming back with their fifth installment on July 6 at 9:30 (10:00 weeks thereafter.)  Instead of Moley Moley, we now have Alison and Donny from   urlLink Big Brother  .  Lord have mercy.  I'll watch it regardless, but they better get booted out really early on!  Just polished off that carrot cake from yesterday.  Geez, this dieting thing really isn't working well.  I don't care whether I carry my weight well or not (M).  I'm v. fat and need to fix it.  Guy across the road who always smokes on his balcony has hung out a Maple Leafs flag.  Big hockey night tonight.  As all the TTC buses say on their digital displays, "Go Leafs Go! Take the Rocket to the ACC" (well, I guess I don't really need that second part.)  Actually did some work on my diss. proposal.  I got right into reformatting my bibliography and dividing it into subject headings.  Quite the task.  Not done, but at least I really spent some good time doing it.  That's it.  More to come...
