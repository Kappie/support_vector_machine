Ranting? Not really, but grouchy since i woke up so early from so little sleep. No flu anymore, but a terrible headache. Anyway, I did well on my exams and i just received the good news that my endorsement for scholarship will be pushed through next school year. (Thank You, Lord!) After last night, i think i need and early trip to bed...but, i can't! I have to practice for the choir and rest most probably a little later. Oh well, still nursing a terrible headache and in depression mode...Hope things will be better tomorrow...
