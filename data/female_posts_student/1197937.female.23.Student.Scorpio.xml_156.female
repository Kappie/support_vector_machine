"of course." OF COURSE OF COURSE! it was so beautifully simple, unadorned, unplanned, and close to my idea of the perfect proposal that my eyes filled up with tears. so yeah, i'm totally in love with mer thank gawd she didn't get with bachelor bob last season who ditched poor weepy estella one week after the show ended! wow. do i sound like a walking tv guide or what.  stop shaking your heads, i have a point to make with all this. i might have said this before, but being "perfect" and trying too hard could actually work against you. you could be like matthew or charlie (both were the last guy to be eliminated from the past two seasons of the bachelorette), the attractive, well-built, romantic, successful, good-with-the-'rents, perfect-on-paper kinda guy, but if the other person doesn't feel it, pack your bags and call a cab buddy. what i love about ian is that he's this cool, flawed, practical, inexpressive, seemingly detached, globe-trotting, struggling-to-open-up kinda guy who only showed one moment of vulnerability throughout the entire season. but that one moment was loaded with meaning because it was so hard to come by and authentic that you just wanna grab him and yell, "i knew it! i knew you liked me! i knew i could turn stone into putty!" trust me, us girls love that. there's no fun in ready-whip. well, don't take me to be the final authority on this or anything. according to the polls, 74% of viewers prefer sweet doting matthew over ian, so i could be wrong. but if you want my opinion, thugs win more than hugs. okay bye.
