I think it will be too much responsibility for her. But I feel that my mom and my sister are both expecting her to be my Maid of Honor. It sucks. Brian and I are both in the same predicament. He would rather not have his brother be his Best Man (because he really isn't), but we both want to follow the norm. I'm enlisting the help of my other Bridesmaids to make sure that everything goes according to plan. I wish my sister wasn't such a screw up.  Snatch  was a really good movie !  I hooked on  IncrediMail  !
