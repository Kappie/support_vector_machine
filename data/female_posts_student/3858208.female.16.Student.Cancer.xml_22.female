My Zoloft helps a lot, but when I don't take it things go right back to how they were a year, two years ago. I don't know ifanyone hasnoticed this or not, although it seems like it would be hard to miss. I guess I've managed to hide it pretty well from the outside world, but I haven't bothered even trying to hide it from my family.   The reason I'm writing this is because for the last two months, I've slept for about four hours every night and overall I've been fine. I also noticed that I would be in a great mood for a while, then suddenly be extremely depressed for no real reason. I started wondering if this was all related to my depression, so I decided to research it. What I found scares me, but it also explains a lot.   My symptoms aren't neccessarily related to depression. They are, however, related to manic-depression, also known as bipolar disorder. I can relate to so much of what I've read about it, to so many of the symptoms; some of which aren't symptoms of normal depression (normal depression...talk about your oxymoron). I don't think I have manic-depression, per say, but I think that if I'm not careful it could get to that point pretty easily.   To be honest, I don't know WHAT to think. I do feel like I have extreme highs and lows, but at the same time it's been so long since I didn't that maybe it's normal. That probably only makes sense to me, but basically I just don't know what life without depression is like. I spend a lot of time thinking about how I would be if I weren't on Zoloft. The idea scares me because even missing one day can make me depressed. The worst part is that all of this is normal for me now. I don't even remember what it's like to be happy without the help of a pill.   I'm so fucked up. And the most ironic thing? Very, very few people even know that I am.    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  confused, thoughtful, scared, subdued, and oh yeah - scared.   listening to/watching ::  nothing. i want total silence right now.   eating/drinking ::  pringles   craving ::  happiness   talking to ::  nobody, its 2:30 in the fucking morning and i should really be in bed.   thinking about ::  depression...bipolar disorder...life in general   wishing ::  I want to know if my happiness is real, or if it's a faux happiness brought on by my "happy pills".   wearing ::  jeans and an old red t-shirt from an elementary school i never went to   random ::  I think and writeabout death a lot. That does NOT mean I'm going to commit suicide or homicide, however.
