Ok, ok, so that's a crap excuse for us being sad and unpopular! But hey I'd rather be like this! I don't want to turn into a slut! Seriously though, all the popular (crap I can't spell that!) girls are realllly slutty and flirty! Aaargh! Scary! Plus then we'd actually have to try to be 'cool'! Eek, I'm happy being chilly thank you very much! ;) ;P :) (Weeeeird girl!) Hmm... I'm just happy being sad! Oh yeah, it is annoying when people walk around like they own the place and like they aren't being your friend because  they  don't want to be your friend! Aaaargh it makes me wanna hit Laura! (Hehe, only joking!) Hmm.... maybe I do need a punch bag! I could get one from Bristol!
