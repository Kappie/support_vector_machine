Well, they're crap.  I've decided to write profiles for each of the respective girl flirting stereotypes.   NOTE: I'm not judging. Just merely poking fun at my gender.  Because as much as I hate to admit it, I do it to.  The "Tee-hee Look at me I'm so Incredibly Helpless" Approach. These girls often begin with simple enough requests, "I'm stupid, can you help me do this problem?"  while batting their eyelashes feverishly.  Later it ends up being the boy doing her homework,  the boy buying her lunch,  the boy waiting patiently as she fake-bawls on his shoulder. Run away while you still can.    The "I am Perpetually a Five-Year Old and Shall Throw Rocks at you Until you Agree to Kiss me on the Swingset" Approach Pretending to hate someone.  What a quick way to their heart.  Usually only high school aged boys pull this one, but occassionally you run into a girl that does it.  They're the worst.  For serious.  Signature moves include: punching, kicking, throwing, stealing, and then running away giggling nauseatingly.  The "If I Don't Pay Attention to you, You'll want me" Approach Sometimes, people will make a large effort NOT to talk to you, just to make you jealous.  This is surprisingly effective considering the incredibly flawed logic behind it.
