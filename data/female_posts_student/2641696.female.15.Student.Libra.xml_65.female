I wrote to the Blog Support staff thingamabob, and they said I had to empty my cache or something... I don't think they understood my question. It turns out like that old template on  ALL  computers, not just on my own. My template just disappeared and was replaced with that stupid anime one!! Hm. Maybe this is a sign -- I should change my template to something anime-ish.   ALALAL. We are in French right now, wee. Mme. C isn't here because she's in the track thing (thank god). I don't think anyone in this class likes her very much, and I have to say I am one of them. Gahhh! She is evil. You know when we  didn't  go to St. Donat?? She made us, the people who didn't go, write 5 journal entries about what we  would  have done and how much fun we  would  have had, had we gone. Stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. I still haven't forgiven her for that.   So anyway, we're all in (or at least, we're all supposed to be in) Etudiant, doing those damn 3000+ Self-Test Questions. I'm not really doing it though, because it's either too easy or too hard and either way it's too boring. So I blog. It seems like this thing is addictive or something. It's just so bubbly and orange and blue...   Hm. Frodo is on the other side of the classroom all by himself messing around in Word. A is right beside me doing her work like the good girl she is, and Murdles is on my left looking at AX clothes or something... Oh, how typical of them all!!! Hm. And I'm blogging. Now what does that say of everyone... Murdles is materialistic, A is a hard-worker and I'm obsessed with myself. Yay!   I wish I could play a game on the computer except I'm not very good at them and I don't really know how to turn the volume down on this comp. Plus, I get very 'into it' when I play a computer game, so probably whoever that sub-teacher is sitting over there will realize I'm not doing work. People usually don't squeal in glee when they get an answer right. Or at least, normal (and cool) (and ridiculously good-looking) people don't. See, I am a normal (and cool) (and ridiculously good-looking) person. And she knows that. (They all know that). And so I can't play a computer game. I kinda lost my train of thought in there, so if it doesn't make sense I'm sorry. I won't bother to re-read it. Editing is for wussies!   Hmm.   Hmmmm....   I have very little to talk about right now, except that I'm impressed with people who wear all black. I'm not wearing all black (it's a grub day, BTW); I'm wearing a tooth-pasty tank/shirt/thingy and jeans. But I  could  have worn all black. But I didn't. So no, I'm not actually impressed with myself. But there is at least one person in this class who wore all black, and I'm impressed with HIM. But most people are, so it's all good ^^;   You know I don't like G? He's too giggly. We should call him Giggles. Honestly. He giggles more than most of my female friends do. That's just scary and wrong. We should kick him out of the school. Actually, I think he's leaving -- I won't spill all the juicy gossip in here, but if I love you and you ask me I just might tell you why ^^; heehee! Yes, my parents are relatively good friends with the parents who are best friends with G's parents. Hm. Plus, my sister is best friends with the daughter of the parents who are best friends with G's parents.   Yeah.   So anyway, seeing as I'm so bored and all and the teacher is giving me funny looks for typing so much. Ooh! There is going to be a french club next year; Mr L just came in to talk to us about it. I think I'm going to join. Maybe. If I wanna be all French-y in Montreal then I gotta learn the language, ne? But I think he said it was either 1 or 2 lunchtimes a week... ack! I got newspaper, man... *sigh* I guess I'll go when I can. Heyy maybe Britnix will join up too, and A and all those other cool people ^^; Then it'll be fun. And apparently Mr L is pretty cool too; that's what N says. Hmm... aw damn... what if N joins??! Aiee! No clubs with my sister. She scares me. I don't like spending time with her.. T.T I bet she won't go though; she doesn't seem like an extra-curricular kinda person...   So's anyways. That's about it. I honestly think I should stop writing now, just in case anybody catches me and I have to exit this window and delete everything and that'd be bad because I wrote such an insanely insane amount. I don't wanna lose all the writing. Ok. Byeee!
