It's not so bad though; the most priceless judge's comment: "The lyrics were too dark for the talent show." They like us well enough, just not enough to take us. We were also boring, or so it was said, and too loud. It makes me weep with wonderous joy, knowing another few have been infected with the poison of loud music; not to addict them to such music, just to exert life from their ears.  So now I've to wait for the fundraiser for Alex's temple, and for Café Express to open again in May. That means we can fill the long hours by figuring out the rest of our songs and putting them to life.  What a boring, boring wait.
