Still got tons of stuff to finish before tomorrow's one-on-one meeting ........... *moan*  James was so nice; he made breakfast ... two eggs w/ apple and orange juice.  I think I haven't been this healthy for a *long* time ... well, except for the non-sleeping part.  It was nice to have someone there, when you were ready to face the morning alone. I owe him a big one.
