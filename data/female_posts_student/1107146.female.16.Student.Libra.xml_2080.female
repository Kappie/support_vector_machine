" Je ne sais quoi ," means something to the effect of "I don't know what"...that's the phrase in quotes right there. Remember in Austin Powers 2 when Dr. Evil was discussing his evil plan in the Starbucks tower and he said, "What the French call a certain...I don't know what," he was actually referring to that phrase. But mostly people laughed because it made him look stupid and ignorant, and we all love a stupid and ignorant person.   Weehee!
