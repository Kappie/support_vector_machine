Below is an exercise which actually convinced my fiction-writing professor to read the fantasy genre. Read here that she was a writer of "literature" and short stories, and her view on any kind of genre was that it was a crutch for writers, falling back on stereotypes and whatnot. So, here it is, the exercise I wrote when she asked us to write a scene in which the fantastic came across as real in the story.    “Dash it all! You wouldn’t believe how much this impedes, if not totally decimates my human-female-behavior studies! How will I ever recover! All my research, all my years of observation gone into the litter-box like so much waste! Really, I can’t believe you!”  “That’s makes two of us,” I muttered, gingerly sipping my coffee as Charlie, or should I say Charles, my cat, glared at me over the brim of my cup as he stood, ears back and whiskers sticking straight out, on top of the entertainment section of my newspaper.  My stomach rumbled and I took a bite out of my cream-cheese-laden bagel the same as I did every morning.  “You’re ignoring me, aren’t you?” Charles continued, spreading his white and gray long-haired butt out in the middle of the comic strip section as he sat on his haunches. “I can’t believe this! Years of work lost just because you decided to switch bi-pedal species, and you don’t seem to care!”  “Excuse me? Since when did I choose to switch species?” I said with a voice muffled by a mouthful of bagel and a few sharp teeth.  “Since four months ago! Or don’t you remember, you with your human-thing addled brain!”  I was being insulted by my own cat, my own 9-year-old, overweight, and until four months ago, otherwise silent cat. All right, maybe not all that silent, he was a bit of a klutz and had a tendency of knocking things over, as well as yowling at me at all hours of the day and night. But since then I’ve learned exactly how loud he can be, and exactly what he yowls now that I can understand him, and frankly I’m just about shy of not giving a damn.  “You know, with all your complaining, I should just put you out. Take you to the pound or something.”  “Then who would protect you?” Even for a cat he sounded genuinely astounded and abhorred.   “I dunno, maybe I could change my renter’s contract and get a dog.”  “A dog! Do you know how much trouble a dog can be?”  “No, but I figure you’ll tell me about it,” I muttered, taking another bite of bagel. I have to admit, I didn’t hear Charles’ response as I chewed because I was too busy admiring the neatly bitten part of the bagel.   Up until an incident four months ago my teeth hadn’t exactly been perfect. Even after having a few teeth removed and enduring years of braces as a teenager, they had had a mind of their own and decided that they wanted to be no only slightly crooked, but also coffee and cola-stained. I won’t even mention the one crown, and all the fillings. Then one day I looked in the mirror and everything was different.  “Would you stop doing that and listen to me?”  I realized Charles had caught me feeling one of my canines with my tongue, and smiled at him broadly in fun. His ears flattened back as he cowed down, eyes wide with fear.  “Would you please stop that,” he said. “You know it makes me uncomfortable.”  “Well, get off my newspaper and go eat some catfood or something. Go chase a mouse or play in the toilet.”  Charles slunk off the table and I got up to get ready for the day. Although a student out for her masters degree in history, and one with mommy and daddy footing the whole bill, including room and board, I still liked to keep my sanity by working part time even if it was helping out in a restaurant. Even as I pulled on my worn jeans and my newly tie-died  and very oversized t-shirt with Korean lettering on it, the thought of spicy kimchee and chocolate Pocky biscuits filled my brain.   “Do you even know what your t-shirt says?” Charlie muttered, hopping onto the toilet seat as I brushed my teeth vigorously over the sink in the bathroom.  I shook my head as I rinsed my mouth out with mouthwash.  Charles was silent.  Looking into the mirror, I ignored him again as I admired my clean, white, perfectly straight teeth, pulling my lips back to see my unnaturally elongated and pointy upper and lower canines. Sure, it was strange, but I wasn’t about to complain, much.  “You think I’m a succubus or something?” I asked aloud.  “Succubus? More like a suck-you-train the way you went after that last male you had here. Lest I remind you that he wasn’t human?”  “Lest you not remind me that I didn’t know it until it was too late,” I said, attempting to talk and apply lipgloss at the same time.  “Too late for who, you or him?”  “Look, how was I supposed to know he was a vampire? It’s not as if these guys are supposed to be real or anything.”  If a cat could shrug, Charlie actually pulled it off. “I thought after dating him for six months you might have noticed. Especially the part about him never eating around you, although he’d take you out to dinner, and the part about him never being around during the day.”  I pursed my lips, and strode out to continue getting ready, Charles catting my every step.   “Look, I understand you hadn’t had sex in years.”  I picked up my purse, rummaging through it for loose change and the occasional dollar bill. I made a mental note to stop by the bank, only to hear Charlie still going.  “I just don’t think vampires were built for that. He looked quite surprised! Quite surprised indeed! After all the legends one would think that they had all kinds of strength. That one practically crawled out of your apartment. I think you did him in or just about!”  I stared at my cat. Until the whole escapade I had never considered what a cat thought, especially about sex, nor had I even considered them watching me, let alone studying me.  “I’m just hoping to meet with an associate of mine who’s visiting in the area to compare notes with, maybe find some new leads. Have you seen Michael lately?”  “No,” I lied. After all the voice-mails (how did he know when I was out) apologizing for this, that, or the other reason for not meeting me on dates, I was not going to add to my embarrassment. The last time I had seen my so-called boyfriend cum vampire had been two nights before at nightclub a friend of mine had coaxed me into for a whole ten minutes. Maybe it was all the noise. Maybe it was seeing Michael literally scrambling to get across the dance floor and out the back door when he saw me. What really got me though was how more than just a few people seemed to be stylishly backing away from me with the look of fear in their eyes. Fear, in what was supposed to be the “in” crowd! As if everything that had happened already hadn’t clearly told me I was different.  “Well, at least we know you’re not a vampire.”  I nodded at this, pulling out enough change to buy some gum with at the corner store. “Yeah, no longing for drinking blood, no fearing garlic. I can even see myself in the mirror, and go out in the daylight.”  “But then there’s that ability to fly.”  “And talk to cats,” I grumbled. So much for trying to pretend I was normal. “So, my little furry Einstein, what am I then?”  Charlie looked up at me with large blue eyes and a worried look on his puss. “I don’t know.”
