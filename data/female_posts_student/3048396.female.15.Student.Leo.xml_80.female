He went to the docotors today and its like some after surgery depression thingy and my Pastor thinks he might of had a small stroke. Who knows tho. Im just prayin he gets all better...and soon. We all miss the old him. Hes just not the same. Anywho on to my excitement factor. We figured it all out so Kait could come stay this weekend...We're gonna pick her up at 6 on the corner or 71 and 3. Then she'll probably stay till Sunday night or so. I can't wait! It'll be so much fun. Shes never been to my house before so yeah...Hopefully we'll get to go shopping or something too. And Saturday n Sunday is when Jeff and his family are here to meet everyone and he'll have his trial sermon n stuff. So it'll be interesting. So it should be a great time. That was the only exciting thing today...planin and talkin to Kait. Everything else was just...blah. Kim came over and started to clean out boxes of crap in my room....not much fun. I guess it was alright. Rearanging stuff is kinda fun. Its just that I have so much shit now and I don't know what to do with it...Oh well. Hopefully most of it will be back to normal by the time Kait comes so the couch can fold out for her. It still smell of paint in there and its kinda makin me sick...but oh well...I'll live. Otherwise nothing much went on today...so I'll leave it at that....
