According to the little men who control the internet, the server is too busy.  Yeh right, 4:45 on a Wednesday afternoon and the server is too busy.   So, my school service club is selling these Cystic Fybrosis things and I was wondering if any of you would like to buy one. You don't really get anything in return, you just get to give me money.  The upside is that they are only a buck, which isn't too bad.  If I sell 5, then I get to attend a pizza party, which isn't really that great because it will be Papa John's and I don't like their pizza.  So, actually, this is a really depressing way to sell something.  I don't get anything, you don't get anything...yup.  So, give me your money now that I've motivated you.  Well, I should go...church tonight!  Yay!
