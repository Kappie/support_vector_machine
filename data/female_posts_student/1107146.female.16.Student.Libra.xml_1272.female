(There will be chocolate-chip cookies involved, baked by yours truly.)  Anyway, I'm glad the whole thing is over.  Is the 17th this saturday?  I think I can come.  Does there need to be any major baking done for it?  I'm willing to do something.  Happy Birthday Will and Josh (even though its kinda late/early)!!!
