The site has exceeded its monthly bandwidth allowance!  hmm.... i wonder how? Just how DID the bandwidth exceed itself, hmm?  Probably from jerks who are too lazy to save pictures on their own servers, and instead link to them from the website!  All right. I don't exactly understand what that means. All i know is, try very hard not to link to pictures that are online unless absolutely necessary, or  1) the "bandwidth" will get "exceeded" and           1a) the site will be shut down, and          1b) the picture will disappear bc it is no longer online, or           OR  2) If you are using up bandwidth, the person hosting the picture will get pissed and do  urlLink this.   This is also why i do not attempt to post pictures here, especially of myself. For the sight of my lovely face would surely incite all of you to include it on your own websites, and the all my bandwidth would be stolen....   It's possible Mr. Fudge managed to exceed his own bandwidth without outside help, but i doubt it. Anyway, it's a good opportunity for a PSAabout the evils of internet theft. Speaking of INTERNET STEALING-TYPE PEOPLE....   Oh, screw this. i'm not the internet Polizistin. My neck hurts and i need sleep. Go to  urlLink Tequila Mockingbird  for further reading.
