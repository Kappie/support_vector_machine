I fucking hate geeks.  this girl chris from oasos asked for my number today.  i dont even know what to do. i dont really like her...  but i gave her my number anyway. why do i do that?   i really want to hang out with melissa. where is she? she makes me all happy and crazy. and shes just fun.  my tummy hurts, and i hate everyone.  hate hate hate.  ::stab::  i hate you.  i had to babysit today and now my back hurts. my cousins are cute. theyre 6 and 3... i used to think they suck but sometimes theyre really fun. they had an argument today about whether i was pretty or cool... lol. made me wish i was 6 again. and we went to noodles and then the 3 year old (marissa) almost peed on me... gross. but we played that horsie game where the little kids ride on your back and now my back and arm hurts.  i want some ice cream. or maybe a lobotomy.  meow.  ~abby
