Those whiny ass sons-of-bitches who have to make life so difficult and be such bitches about everything.  I hate being around anything that remotely relates to people like that.  I don't care about this person and that person.  The thing that I hate is how people do that nonchalant bragging, as if it somehow makes them cool.  Where they casually bring something up as though it's not intended to be bragging, but really is. And then there is the anti-bragging, where one rants about something they're actually boasting about.  I mean, when I talk about something, it's because I'm either pissed about it, sad about, happy about it, or excited about it. Or some other emotion.  I like to share how I feel, not make people feel like I'm just sharing. Please. God. Spare me.  I'm in this ranting sort of mood tonight because, for no real reason, I feel sort of upset. Just by...high school.  I think the real reason is that I just hate being upstaged.  Of all my faults (minus the ones I'm condemned to hell for--which I definately wouldn't be discussing in a public blog, due to severity of such issues), I think my biggest fault is that I can NOT deal with being out-done.  I hate it when people are smarter, prettier, nicer, more of a badass, etc... than me.  I can not deal with being out-done.  It's ridiculous, and of course you're thinking 'get over it', but it's impossible.  I mean, I'm the type of person who knows how to get talked about...I know how to get attention, and I don't like it taken from me in any way.  One thing I've always hated, since elementary school, is when I'm the best at something, and then someone comes along and knocks me down. Second best is a thousand times harder to bear than worst.  I would much rather be worse at everything than be second best.  And, well, I'd much rather just be best, to be honest.  I'm very paranoid about that sort of thing too.  Honestly, I know that no one is trying to knock me down, just as I never try to knock anyone down either.  I work solely for myself, and I don't really give a fuck about what most other people are up to anyway.  But for some reason I get this idea in my head that everyone is just trying to knock me down.  Ridiculous, I know.  So I'm self-centered and I like to have my way. At least I have persistence.  That's what'll get me what I want.  I guess I'm very open about my self-centeredness.  But why would I not be? I know it, and I'm honest about it.  I don't hide it behind bragging and vanity.  That lacks all class.  I have so much more to say right now, but unfortunately, my lack of sleep is seriously catching up with me.  I do have one thing to say though--my jaw is killing me.  It has been constantly popping for like the past...oh...month? And now the right side is swolen, and it's in a constantly clenched position.  I'm really starting to get worried, because it's seeming more serious than I had originally thought.  I just wish I could relax my jaw...I can't describe the 24/7 pain and discomfort it's causing me.  The only time it's okay is when I'm chewing something.  That's probably what caused it...chewing things...for best example, obviously, gum.  And the past month is when I stopped chewing gum. Hmm..what a coincidence.  Anyways, I'm tired, my jaw hurts, my feet are sore, my eyes are strained, and my brain is getting cramped from all this thinking.  So yeah...  Told you I was in a ranting mood tonight.  Oh well...does a body good.  Shut the FUCK up, crazies.  Nah, just be cool.
