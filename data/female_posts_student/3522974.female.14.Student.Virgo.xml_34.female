After sport the teachers were like taking snail steps and everyone was like "hurry up!!!" and so finally everyone was on the bus and it was like 10 past, so 5 min later we arrived bak at skool, so we got there just after the bell (3:15). Ellen, Sammy-G, Mel, Beth and I all sprinted to our bags, where we decided to just put our blazers and skirts on. After that we thought it looked to weird and noticible, so we took off our sneakers and put our stockings and skool shoes on. So we all looked decent (except for mel n ellen, who didnt bother changing) and the only thing different bout our uniform was that we had our sports top underneath our blazer and jumper. Well Guess what...? Good news or bad news first? Good news. We successfully caught our correct bus. Bad news. Guess who happened to have bus stop duty today?  Renalds . The deputy princible. The First [ evil ] (buffy thang). Yeh so she happily gave us all  detentions  and was about to make us go bak and get changed (and miss our bus) except that mel saved us and sed she would b l8 for community service. Ne ways, i just got bak from our VERY BIG small group. It was a merge of Tanya and Helen/Rach's small groups. Yay! Ne way we just talked and ate 4 a while untill we started the small group topic which was  worship . Great fun ! Wow, im havin de ja vu. Excellent. Neways, we sed some words of worship to god and sang a bit, and yeh... LOluv, TTFN-(tata4now, as tigger always sed) CM
