Took a while to edit this one. Had to add in the comments, and jippy code, and the links, and tinker with the way it archives and shows posts. Not totally satisfied with the archival system, but it will have to do. I'll change it later.  And when I am big and powerful, and am sitting next to an HTML/Blogger master, I'll change the colors, and that will be cool.
