It was almost depressing since it's Thursday and there's nearly nobody out. I'm full. I guess it was our way of celebrating. I don't know if it's just Dad's taciturn quality shining in him or if he was just unusually quiet like that. I'm like that too. I wonder if it's equally annoying when I just sit there, quiet, in front of other people.  We saw an accident on the way home. An SUV just flipped over. I couldn't help but feel sad. Everyone was driving at least five miles slower after the accident site. I wonder what people have to do to let that happen to them. Granted, I'm not the most attentive driver, but would that happen to me? That would be a horrible way to suffer, to die.  I need to convince Mom that I'm fit enough to drive to Sycamore Cove tomorrow. Or rather, that the road is fit enough for me to drive on. She's somehow terrified of PCH, though I don't see much difference between that and, say, the 23. I just really want to exercise some measure of independence and go out there myself. I won't show her the mapquest directions though. It says it'll take 42 minutes to go 31.21 miles from my house. Maybe that scares her? Usually Lydia errand trips don't go beyond 15 one way. Mom's decided to be reasonable, fortunately, and will look over a map with me. I better find it first so I can find the best route.   I'm full.
