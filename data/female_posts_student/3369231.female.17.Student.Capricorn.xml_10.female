Why he didn't want his friend Chelsea talking to me. His answer---- She is his friend, and that us talking creeps him out.  2. Why couldn't he just tell me about Sara instead of hiding it and leading me on. His answer---- He told me the next day because it had happened that night.  Right  after he got off work at 8:00 I suppose.  Or at least sometime in between him getting off work and then coming to my house later on that night.  Oh well.. guys will be guys I suppose.  Still confuses me but oh well.  Well, Nick if you read this.  I am not really tooo pissed off anymore.  I just wish you would have told me that night about Sara.  Fair enough right?   Well.. off to Ashley's...
