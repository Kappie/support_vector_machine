My family has a joke that its really Irene from a few years back coming back to woop our asses. But, this time Miami will roughly get the backlash of it. Or probably a tail.  Or if its really supernatural, it'll change course and run us over. Then it'll stop curve around Florida and hit us ALL over again.  I fell sorry, for the people on the west coast. Charley was upgraded to a four from a three. I believe Andrew from when I was five was a four.... Or was it a six? I don't know all I know is that it was scary as FUUUUDDDGGGGEEE, afterwards of course! I remember it. We were hiding in the closet and I slept completely through it. Only when the eye came I had to piss so my dad lead me to the bathroom. But it was all quiet and scary and dark. Really really dark.  Afterwards there was debris all over the place. And it just looked like something from a scary movie. The only cool thing to come out of it was that I got my first pet bird, which was a crow that had a broken wing. We named him...Come to think of it...His name was Furgee....  I was heartbroken when we let him go back out into the wild.  I loved Furgee so much. I think sometimes when I'm doing dishes, Furgee sits on the fence and watches me.... how sweet. Of course, all those damn crows look the same *shrugs*  That gives me an idea for a very interesting story. (Heheheehehe)   edit: Charley IS begining to woop our asses with backlashes from its tail. I'm guessing its gonna be raining all night tonight =D
