It does more harm than good.... at least thats what I think anyways. I think this whole blogging thing is turning out to be a good thing though..Its nice to be able to just vent and not feel like you are being judged for it. I guess a lot of times I feel that way... Anyhoo..Frustrations....too many to possibly mention right now. I just can't believe the way this week has gone. I think things are beginning to turn around and then blamo something else hits me like a deer in the headlights. I finally have my computer back...of course last night when I went to pick it up at my dads he dropped the freakin power cord so I couldn't even use it after I got it home. Today I bought one though so its all good. Worst of all things was I got in a big fight with my boyfriend tonight. I'm really upset about it so I figured I would just come on here and get it out of my system. We got in a fight over what our plans are for this weekend. Sounds stupid enough right? Well it turned into this whole huge fiasco and he has now gone to sleep not speaking to me which I think is the absolute worst thing that one person can do to another. I feel totally crummy. Maybe this is an overshare but I'm open person. Well I don't want to really talk about it anymore. I need to either go to sleep myself or watch a movie or something to get my mind off it...  Elations-I had dinner at the Texas Roadhouse...pathetic that is the best thing about my day..i know
