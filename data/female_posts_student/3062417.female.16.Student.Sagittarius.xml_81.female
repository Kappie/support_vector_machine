And then this morning I went shopping w/ my Dad and then just came back here. And now I'm just sitting here doing nothing and being bored out of my mind and talking to Danielle and Jon. I think I'm going to scan my prom pictures into the computer while I'm here after my dad is done looking at them. Maybe if I get that done I'll attempt to put some of them in here later.
