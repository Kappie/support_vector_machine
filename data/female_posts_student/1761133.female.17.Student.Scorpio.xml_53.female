Your companions aren't likely to be thinking straight and may not respond to reassurance, dear Scorpio, so you'll need to use your intuition to determine the best way to defuse the situation. Also, finance might be causing some worries right now, but your innate ingenuity and money sense should put things right. Tonight: go out and have a good time!  OMG...this is exactly what is happening today...In the future I want to be a pschologist, and I'm always helping someone with thier problems, and I know I will end up having to help someone again. One of my friends isn't thinking straight because one of her friends started avoiding her (they kinda made up yesterday, but she is still uneasy). And tonight I am going out to have a good time...Night of Jazz and all...and Dylan's going to be there, YAY!  Oh, btw, I went to a basket ball game yesterday...girls...we won by 20 points...go figure...
