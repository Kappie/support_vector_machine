Friday, 9th July  the day was spent with the girls (well some of them), bridey, kate, alana, jess and jenny wacthing DVD's at my house.  The hardest part was deciding what we wanted to watch but before that could be done we all had to go and get food from across the road. Bridey said the words "pepperoni Pizza" about 50 times so there was no doubting what she wanted.  So we got that for 5 bucks....last time i get cheap pizza without coupons considering i dont work there anymore...wooohooo....lol the rest went across the 7/11 trying to decide wat to buy, once they did they came back to domnios were bridey decided it  would be a good idea to moon the managers on the inside LOL...well back to the movies and we decided after much debate that we would watch "10 things i hate about you", which was a great choice except for when kate and jess decided to recite everyword to the whole entire freaking movie and jenny offering pplpopcorn every 2 seconds!!! Once that was over the time was spent lazying about my house on the computers, sleepign or PLAYING IQIIQgames?!?!...who knew my friends were all nerds. well after all this we decided to head of to hurzy where we ate, chatted and officaly decided that the first holidays in the july holidays is "BUSH WEEK" thats right girls....it is bush week! me mosied on around for i duno how long and then jenny and i caught the bus home and the oters were still there. i then switched houses for the week so im back in Beverly Hills.  Then came the daunting task of deciding what we were goign to do tonight...it finally came to the desicion that bridey, akte alana and me were going to Kyams for fun with the girls, therese, layla, leigh, monte(who decided throwing meat pies would be fun..untill i got him back), lil will, big will, tom, Kyam, matt, jessy, aaron, edward etc etc.  i had a mad time, runnign around, marrying big will and doing whatever and then at 12.30 we had to deicde whether we were goign to the reseraunt in Oatley or home...after much callign and thought of mine (and stressing alana out greatly) we decided to go to the resteraunt. so well all started our trek to riverwood station where we met up with the stoners who well didnt get there weed in the end so they were pretty pissed...and not in a good way. can i say the highlight of the walk was FINALLY getting to take one of those security stickers that says "WARNING P.M.S"...thats right girls i fianlly got it!!! we caught the train to sydnham and on the way i ralsied that the other top i had one was missing (i only took it off cause it was too wet from the rain)...it was the top my mum bought me, first time i wore it and it was gone. i swear i put it in toms bag but who knows it may still be at kyams...well thats what im hoping...so i got really bumbed by that...at this time itwas 2.30 and i decided to save the resteraunt for another time and i went to morty station where i caught a taxi home. i got int he door at 3am and everyone was asleep...but this morning my dad some how new i came home at 3am AND HE DIDNT MIND. i was just like wtf? haha....So that was my last night adventure...had the maddest tiem untill my top went missing...makes u think how thigns could be different if u didnt make certain desicions...but thats a whollleee other story all together.  BACK TO TODAY  i woke up to the sounds of my noisey family at 11o clock including my bakar(grandma) that was over. i came on msn as i always do and well had a discussion with a "him"...omg i could have blown up...he decides to tell me how he "really feels" even tho he has supposedly told me how he really feels like 20times...but it changes everytime...todays themes was how angry and pissed off i make him.....im like oohh kkkk lets not open this can of worms becasue u wont be able to close it...be proud of me jenny i didnt say anythign mean back or anything....i was holding it in..if i said how i really felt i duno what could of happened.  Well that was another lil whing session. So Anwyay.....these are just tiems when u have to look at the positives in situations and think abotu all the fun and friends you ahve with u....I love u all guys.... checkyas laters....MWA
