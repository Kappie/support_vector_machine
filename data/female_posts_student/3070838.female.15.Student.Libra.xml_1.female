These four young men gave us excellent assistance in the Bike Rental Shoppe and the Adult Pool. When we were new to Seaside these four young men welcomed us in and showed us that not all poolside workers are 50+ recovering alcoholics. Many of them are, in fact, attractive teenagers looking for summer jobs. Now, I'm not saying they don't have their... retarded sides, but they are generally fairly normal. We would like to thank them for not kicking us out of the adult pool and for not landing on top of us in the pool- feel sure that would have resulted in a couple of broken bones. So to these hotties I say hello, Philadelphia
