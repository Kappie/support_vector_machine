Sure, it's a loveleh car and all, but I don't think we have that kind of extra money. But if he does buy it, he promised that he'd teach me to drive standard. Ha. Well, while we were out driving it, I saw a guy dressed in a semi-tight pink t-shirt walking down the street, and I laughed at him. Only until later did I realize I laughed at the drummer for The Trews.   9.  Go to a big concert   Anyways, we picked Lisa up and my dad dropped us off at the mall to catch a shuttle bus to the Bluffs for the Evanescence concert. We cruised through the mall a little and took more of those photobooth pictures (but we're going to go back and take better ones). We almost missed the shuttle to the concert, but then we didnt. Also, because the driver didn't know what was really going on; we didn't have to pay for our ride.  When we got to the concert, there were quite a few opening bands; I think some of them were locals too. One band, there were only three of them; they were called The Hecks. The guitarist played really well, and had the Mick Jagger lips. Lisa and I stood in second row and while Seether played, these two big guys (who must have been like seven feet tall) pushed us out of the way and stood in front of us. This girl next to us got really mad and flipped out at them and pushed them back out of the way. It was so funny. Almost as funny as the girl behind Lisa who kept bending over to re-arrange her folded blanket.  Finally when Evanescence played, the crowd got rowdy and that's when some 300 pound black guy socked me in the face. I also learned that you can't fight the fact that you're going to be touching a whole lot of people; and if you try to, you're just going to get hurt. Evanescence put on a really good concert, which kind of took me by surprise, but it turned out to be an incredible concert.
