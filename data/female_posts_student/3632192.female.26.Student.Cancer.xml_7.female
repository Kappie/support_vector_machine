Since many types of cancer exist, anyone at any age has a risk of being diagnosed.  In “My family has cancer”, Oswaldo’s nightmares started when he was three years old when his father died of cancer.  Now Oswaldo and his daughter Lara are going through the same nightmares.  I could relate to his story because my grandmother had cancer and it took only three months for her to leave us.  Oswaldo states about the medicine that can be aggressive against the illness, with appalling side effects.  I have seen my grandmother totally changing her appearance with no hair, red blisters all over her feet, hands and her skin as grey as it can get.   She could not walk as she was confined to bed with all tubes around her.  She couldn’t recognize anyone.  I could see the pain in her eyes, and she couldn’t talk.  There were only two nurses for the whole ward.  The nurses would avoid the patients as they didn’t want to see their pain. The cancer hospital in Sri Lanka is run by the government, therefore it lacks lots of funds, resulting few beds, staff, doctors, medicine and etc.  When I was visiting my grandmother there would be people lying on the floor and there was one time the patient next to my grandmother’s bed has passed and only a sheet covered the body.  This was a pathetic scene.  Cancer is like a queue to be stayed in to sign your death sheet.  Visiting the hospital made me feel so lucky to be healthy, although I was manipulated by the fear on when cancer is going to hit me.  Oswaldo says the same thing about people who do not want to face reality.  He also mentions how some people might not want to see the pictures of his wife posted on the web, because they do not want to see the truth.  I agree with his statement, because people do not think of unexpected circumstances that could happen to them.  They would just worry about money, positions in life, power and all the materialistic stuff they could gain.  It is natural to think about climbing a hill and not climbing down a hill.  But life is so unpredictable and anything could happen at any time.  Today, people worry about changing their self-appearances by doing all sorts of operations such as silicon implants, liposuction, and many more makeovers. I sometimes wonder why? Is this all happening because lack of love?    We should be thankful for just being alive. Life is a hike with hills to climb up and down.  No one should waste time by feeling low about oneself and regretting what you have done in the past. The world and life is too beautiful to waste.  Because you would never know when you would be hit by a dreadful disease like cancer, and be in that queue of suffering.  All we could do is hope for the best and live life.
