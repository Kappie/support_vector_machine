But you know bears do it all the time. Just lie down and go to sleep for months. One morning it’s winter time, and the next, it is spring.  Mariam: You know, that would be very freaky. It’s funny how fast time seems to travel. It’s scary to think that the second time passes by it is gone forever…irretrievable. It is beyond impossible to ever bring back a moment. Thankfully, my friend, I am not a bear. I am more like a hyena. At least my laugh is, as my good friend pointed out.   Amina: Yes, indeed. A second is irretrievable. For those reading this blog,(unlike Salma) how many minutes have they lost? And yet, how much have they gained? A different perspective, a new thought to munch on, and a whole lot smarter, wouldn’t you agree? I say, you do resemble a hyena, slightly.   Mariam: Ahhh! Ideas…they flow in my head. Some are born slowly…gradually they begin to form into a clearer shape, until they mature  and are completely developed. From intangible to tangible they become. Others race around in my head as quickly as lightening flashing in a dark storm, lost forever. Still, others die before they are even born. Miscarried in my head. Wait a second…if I’ve told you once, I’ve told you twice. I do not like the word miscarried. Excuse me?! Miscarriage sounds like it’s the woman’s fault…like she didn’t carry the baby properly. I do not, do not like that word. That word, That word, I do not like. Does that remind you of somebody?  Amina: Do I remember that? That do I remember? Quite frankly, YES… I do remember. That style of writing was that of the famous Dr. Seuss. Well, my ideas are like the things in the ocean. That is to say, some are coral reefs; all entangled up, and of various shapes, sizes, colors. Others are like tiny fishies swimming around. And even others are like the treasure chests buried deep within the ocean. I know that they are there, yet, I can’t seem to remember where they are. I can’t seem to open the treasure chest, until at last, when I least expect it, I remember and the chest is opened to reveal the hidden, glorious treasure: perhaps it is a fond memory, a creative idea (that at first I can not seem to form), or maybe it’s just a thought that will make me smile when things aren’t that great.   Mariam: How very amusing. But I must beg to differ. Unlike your ideas, the ocean is deep…rich. It is wide and almost infinite in a sense. Your ideas are shallow. Cliché. I will allow you to say that you do have some good ideas but they are like a warm current that passes only in summer. Although it has the possibility of having a monumental effect, it doesn’t because as quickly as it comes…it disappears.   Amina: well my dumpling (notice the term dump in it) if your ideas are like plants sprouting and maturing you must remember that they are also like them in the sense that they are stomped on, pulled (yours are mostly weeds) and those that actually mature into trees are cut down. Aaah, my friend, we never hear the stories of the trees that have been cut down. Instead, we go and write our own stories on paper which comes from the trees. And so the question remains. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
