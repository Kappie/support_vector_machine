Maybe instead of encouraging less commercial hobbies, you can just switch to  Barcode Kitties . These equally adorable cats have nothing to hide. Nothing covert here, their whiskers are  barcodes ! Launched in Japan, by the  urlLink Seikodo Corporation , you'll be seeing their UPC tattooed faces all over our shores and stores very soon.
