Nothing too exciting is going on. I bought some pot today with Fish. I went to work tonight.    Mike comes home tomorrow!!! I'm so excited! I can't wait to see him. I'm gonna call his house tomorrow and see what time he gets home, I'm also gonna go out and get a little gift for him, cause I can't help but love the guy. Hehe.   I might have a little party for him on thrusday night...or hell, maybe he'll wnat to have one tomorrow night.   I was thinking of calling Lysan, but I dunno. I think I want to just chill with him and Fish. We haven't had some time together in a long time and we always have so much fun together. Just the tree of us, Fish and I always talk about how complimenting we all our to eachother as friends.    I'm excited for the upcoming year, grade 12, wow. It's going to be a lot of work, but a lot of fun at the same time. Yearbook, driving, turning 18, new freedoms, gr. 12 status...oh man...so much is happening, so soon.   Well, I guess I'll be on my way.   Oh. Ben leaves for Guelph soon...I should call him and see him. I miss him. I love that guy, he's my sweetheart, we can't help but love eachother so much.   Anyways...   I'm off I suppose...   Goodnight...til we meet again.
