I've been told that I'm not even allowed to open my mounth too wide! My brace brackets keep getting caught on the springs and I have to unlock my mouth every time I want to talk! I've been cursed with an over bite! Why god oh why must I be punished so? This is horrid, it's like haveing a sore throat for three to four months so you try to minimize how often you talk.   This should be good for my waist line though, it's taken me ten minutes to get through two small peices of cheese!   As for my none-mouth related life. I have an exam every day next week. And one this week. My school is running the provincial pilote programme for provincially testing grade tens in math science and english, I guess this is in replacement of the FSAs.   Ahhhhhh... Trying to chew again and it's not working too well. The only good thing about these springs is that you can't see them... Unless I show them.
