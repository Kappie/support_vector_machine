Maybe it was because I sat on my ass for 3 hours after school for play practice. Maybe it was just because it was Monday. Anyways, it just kinda sucked. Play practice was mildly interesting. Wronski gave me a massage...don't ask. And then he pretended to write something bad on my neck, and I smacked really hard in the head. I felt bad afterwards though, because he wasn't really writing anything. Oh well. He probably deserved it for something else. I got my character chart for Romeo and Juliet back in English, and my teacher really liked it. I got 100, yay. I spent a really long time on it, so whatever. Eh, tomorrow should be better for me, I'll actually get to go onstage for practice. Its a little sad when thats the highlight of your day, but hey, I'm lame. Meh.
