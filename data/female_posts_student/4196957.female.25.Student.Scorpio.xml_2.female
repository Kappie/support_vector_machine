We have fun in store for us because any section of Texas is just bursting with interesting sights and tempting shopping, but the best part of my journey took place today on the way up to Granbury. This trip will include a trip to see the dinosaur prints in Glen Rose, shopping on the town square in Granbury and seeing the sights in Cowtown; as enjoyable as all of this may be, none of it could compare with the 8 mile detour from our route on Highway 6 into Crawford today. Crawford seems simple enough with its population of 705 and its identity as a farming community, but there is something very special about this little town. In 1999, George and Laura Bush purchased a ranch just outside the sleepy little town and Crawford went from a place people accidentally detoured to a place people centered vacations around.       Being in Crawford today was a joy for this Babe for Bush! There are several shops featuring Texana and country chic decor while others feature jewelry and clothing. Each of these little shops also carries a wide array of Bush 2004 and "Crawford, Home of President and Mrs Bush" merchandise. They are all so pround that the President and First Lady chose to call their charming little town home. The locals treat guests with utmost courtesy and their adoration for our President and First Lady is evident after seconds of conversation. Every storefront had a Bush banners and most yards had Bush signs up, so I was feeling very much at home.       During our two hours in Crawford, we managed to make a haul while shopping on Main Street. I am now the proud owner of Bush buttons, a Bush Cheney 2004 t-shirt, a Crawford magnet and some booty to bring home to my Bush loving grandparents. We also ate lunch at the little restaurant that has been featured numerous times on the news as George and Laura seem to have an affinity for the cheeseburgers served there. I had the cheeseburger as well and opted for the onion rings favored by the President rather than the friend jalapenos favored by our first lady; I'll have to give those a shot next time. After eating lunch, we drove out toward the President's residence, Prairie Chapel Ranch. We knew, of course, that we would not be able to actually drive by the ranch. Generally, anyone can drive by the ranch so long as the stay on the main road, but we knew the President was actually occupying The Western White House today and such a trip would not be allowed. We drove out as far as we could, wanting to get a feeling for the land our President calls home, before being turned away by a local deputy and a secret service agent.       If you are ever out around Waco and are thinking about detouring, definitely do it. Crawford is a charming town with great people, nice gift shops and delicious onion rings.  I believe I'll visit again, perhaps during our 43rd President's second term. :-)
