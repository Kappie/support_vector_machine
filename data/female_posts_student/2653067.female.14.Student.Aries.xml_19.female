I live across from SAve-On Foods in the green co op MAybe you could come by sometime. You;ve got really nice hair, I have barely any hair:( Have you ever been kissed? I have WHat kind of music do you like? I like grunge, heavy metal and classical (  anything done by Beehtoven, Bach, Mozart). I"ve been single since October...... Do you like the game, truth or dare, ? I do.   Tell me, Does this this guys letter seem scary to you?  Should it be scary?  It's creeping me out.  This person "likes" me a lot  more then I like them.  Ah god.  Why did this have to happen to me? *Looks up at the sky sadly*.  I really don't know what to do.  Any word of wisdom for a poor, afraid almost 14 year old?
