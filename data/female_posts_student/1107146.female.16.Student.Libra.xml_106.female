It's the most fun I've had since owning Alex on Aztec last weekend.  It was the same scenario this morning as yesterday, I woke up dead, no NyQuil this time though. And then my dad asked me, "Want anything dude?" and I was like..."Yeah...get me some Crunch Berries," So the balance of my morning was spent eating Crunch Berries and reading a collector's comic my dad borrowed from this fanbody at his office, called  The Punisher , it was really sick, the last chapter was through the mouth of this guy getting some teeth worked on, a mob guy, and suddenly The Punisher shows up and knocks all his teeth out, it is SO sick.  Gross.  More later, Seth called back.  FunFUNfUN
