I mean, if they are not even willing to put in the effort to do research on the things they are saying, and are obviously picking up information from really bad movies, and taking that as being the truth because it was on the big screen in glorious technicolor... That is the problem with some people nowadays. They take everything at face value, and glom onto someone else's opinion, rather than finding out the realities and forming their own. I have been Pagan for a long time, and it was not because I felt like freaking people out or wanting people to judge me because of those beliefs. My beliefs ring true to ME. I don't follow someone else blindly down a path and say this is the way everyone has to think. And I am sick to death of being asked the inane questions that I get repeatedly bombarded with, questions based on silly Hollywood fantasies about magic and pagans. For crying out loud, people, if you want to ask me a question, then do yourself and me a favor...research the information you are looking for FIRST. Then ask for my views. Otherwise, you may get a rather nasty response from me. Hooray for Hollywood? Not hardly...
