I'll be there for 5 days, and I've been psyched ever since I got my tickets!  I'm leaving December 30th and Coming back January 4th, so I'll be able to party with my pal Puff and her guy for New Years!  Kick ass!  God only knows I've needed a vacation, and this will do the trick.  5 days in the nice Orlando sunshine should help greatly in my battle against myself.
