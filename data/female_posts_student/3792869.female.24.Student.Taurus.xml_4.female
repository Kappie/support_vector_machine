I'm kinda freezing and I don't know if it's because of the airconditioning (which isn't too cold, anyways) or because I got soaked in the blasted godforsaken rain this afternoon.  What a day. I spent the morning looking at apartments and e-mailing and calling prospective roommates who ended up NOT being interested or able to share an apartment with me. Suffice it to say I wasn't in the best mood when I made my way down here this afternoon. Who wouldn't be? I'm under so much pressure to look for an affordable studio (within the $500 range, with enough space) or one bedroom apartment (low $600 range please), or a roommate for the two-bedroom garden apartment in my building or the one bedroom apartment I saw today within two weeks, before I go home to the Philippines for a visit. And I haven't found anything today. Tomorrow is my deadline for confirming with my landlord whether or not I'll take the garden apartment. I haven't found a roomie for that unit yet, so I'm screwed.  If I don't find an affordable studio or one-bedroom apartment or a roommate for a two-bedroom apartment (which I would need to scout for, if I can't have the place downstairs), I am screwed. I would have no choice but to deal with my bitch of a roommate for one more year, and I DON'T WANT THAT. Actually, I'm pretty mad at her because I wouldn't have considered looking for another apartment, if she weren't hell-bent on making my life miserable. That bitch just complained last week that she couldn't sleep well because she could see my desk light from her bedroom window (my desk is in the living room because my room is about 2/3 of hers) and hear me typing at night. She asked me if I could do my work in my bedroom at night--never mind if it means squeezing myself into my teeny desk, which I have since turned into an altar, or working on the floor in the event that I use many books. I told her she couldn't do anything about my working/study habits (i.e. if I work better at night and need a bigger desk, like the one in the living room, especially when I type my papers and refer to several books at a time) and that bitch reminded me that she moved her stupid parakeet into her room (she never asked me if I minded her putting that godforsaken bird in the living room, to begin with) so I could do my work. Ergo, I better do stuff for her?! She even insinuated that I could probably use one book at a time if I were to study in my room at night, so that I could use my desk. Where does she get off telling me to change my study habits, when she takes offense at every suggestion I make? You tell me.   If only it weren't more affordable and practical to share an apartment, I would live in a studio or one-bedroom apartment, so that I can have my own life and not step on anyone's toes. But that's not the way housing works around here.  I was supposed to meet Budul and Rizza at the Shedd Aquarium this afternoon but my bus was running late and I got off at the wrong stop twice. I considered just going straight here (at around 230PM), but no, I was nice enough to take the bus again (after getting off at the wrong stop for the first time) in the f*cking downpour. Well, shortly after I got off at the wrong bus stop and while walking toward the right stop, Budul texted me and said he'd just meet me at the Union Station kasi di na daw ako aabot if humabol pa ako sa kanila. Shit. Wish he'd told me that earlier.  By the way, Budul is in love with me. Okay lang but right now, I could care less because I'm in a bad mood. Di pa kami officially but I want my space. He's going back to New Hampshire tomorrow. Maybe I'll miss him, maybe I won't.  Dammit, my joints are starting to hurt. I better get off the computer, especially since the library is about to close.
