How are you all doing?! I am doing quite well myself.  today I woke up bright and early at 8 AM!! Then we went to go helpmy grandpa move. They sold there house. it is quite quite sad.  See, I was supposed to get married there and now it's gone. It's the most beautiful house in the entire world.  Oh well..  So we got to move all there photo albums. i foung the album from when my mom and dad got married. Haha! It is SO funny. I found a picture of my uncle dave. Haha. He looks kinda like one of the beatles. It's so funny. My mom and dad had a cool cake. It had all these pink flowers on it. I want a slice righhttt now.  My grandpa gave me 6 dollars for helping him! Wooohooo!  At about 12 we went to go to trader joes and I got lunch. I got this super good turkey swiss sandwhich! Yummm!  Then we went to the orthodontist. They were like "Good job Laura!" and they gave me a new wire! They also gave my spacers on my back tooth which is kinda weird but whatever.  Whenever I go there all the perfect smile ladys always laugh at me. I think it's a good thing but who knows..  They go this crazy self check in thing where you click on your name and it shows your PHOTO!! It's SO crazy. then it's like please type in you birthday for verification. So cool.  They also have these tooth burshes that have toothpaste pre stuck on the tooth brush...also very coool!!  Orthodontist are always ont he top of things.  Then we went to beacocks and I got 2 shiny new guitar picks!!! I saw this guy there and I was like "wow..he looks really familiar..." then I realized he is the guy emily is going to marry!! Hahahhahahahahah  I betterrr gooo!  Adios Amigos!  laura Fantora
