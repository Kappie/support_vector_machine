I am taking what can interchangeably be called a "reading" day, a personal day, a "sick" day. If anyone tries to scold me for this, well a pox on you. I just don't care. I think I am displaying signs of burn-out syndrome, mainly the apathy. I have been acting like Peter from Office Space, post-hypnosis.     So last night I decided, lets all watch a movie in Rachel's Room. I opted to see  Reservoir Dogs  a classic, but lets just discuss some things. Yes, I remember why I broke up with guest #1 in Feb. Yes, so he came over first and we were hanging out, and then he was like "I'm getting hungry, are you?" and I said "No I just ate," pointing toward my half eaten Kebab which I was saving for later. Well, he gets up walks across the room, grabs it and starts unwrapping it. It didn't really occur to me what was happening until the thing was almost in his mouth, so I said, "Uh, sure you can have it." Why didn't I say, uh, drop it dude, step away from the Kebab. Later he decided to sit entirely too close to me, I said something to try to kindly get the don't-bust-a-move idea across. Can he not take hints?  He only sat closer . What is wrong with men? So, later on, I was hungry, OBVIOUSLY, since I never got to eat my whole Kebab. Hellloooo. So I said, I am ordering pizza from Nemati's. I ordered Caprichosa, my fav. The pizza gets here and I pay, but he digs in , without asking, then after eating 2/3 of the damn thing said, "I was gonna pay for part of it." Really, were ya now, funny because I thought I was going to  eat  part of it. I offered pieces to my two buddies sitting there, cuz I felt bad the whole food thing had erupted into a communal eating endeavor without them getting any. So I offered. In the end I was still hungry. Oh, and doesn't it seem a little, I dunno uncouth to just waltz in to your ex-girlfriend's room, and rather than chill on a chair or grab a seat on the rug, to plop right down on her bed to watch a movie. He didn't ask, and frankly thats my bed, thats just ewww, I dunno not right. So, there we all were, the Brady Bunch, watching Reservoir Dogs...Ex and I sitting on the bed,one friendchillin' in a chair, andone on the rug.    Lovely, well I have read like 259,000 pgs today so I guess this is not really a day off. Yes, I know I took the weekend off, but really I spent entirely too much of it reading for school. Crime and Punishment has been neglected because ofthe Olympic-sizedreading assignments for class. Lemme tell ya, In re: Sealed Case, is not a fun read. Figuring out the magnitude of the Patriot Actamendments effect on FISA is an ugly topic involving civ pro, con law, crim law, and all kinds of criminal theory I know nothing about. I thinkmy brain is going to explode.
