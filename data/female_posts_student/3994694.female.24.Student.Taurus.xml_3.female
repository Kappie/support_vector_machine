I was kind of thinking we would wait until after we graduated, but since we were both quitting our orignal degrees and embarking on new study plans that was going to be a long time (considering I'm still at uni now at age 24). I remember hitching a ride home one night and two girls asking me why I was getting married. And I remember thinking -- if you've  met  him and  found  him already, why not snap him up? Why waste time you know, and wait until we're old?  I'm not sure I have the same view now, as there are complicating factors to that point of view. One is the 'marrying a total psycho without realising' factor. I've recently heard of a school friend who (apparently, according to others' analyses) married a "total psycho" (that's a quote) and was divorced within 5 months. Fortunately, that wasn't my case as we were engaged for 2 years (though my husband may admit privately he had no idea what kind of psycho he was getting himself in for with me). Secondly, I no longer subscribe to the Mr Right point of view (I love the fridge magnet that says "when I married Mr Right, I didn't know his first name was Always"). Mostly because I do believe love is hard work, whether you were made for each other or not, and there's never going to be this perfect man (or woman) that you are perfectly suited to and in tune with. So possibly my thoughts on the matter where I thought I had found Mr Right and better marry him immediately are not so rational to me now, or even at the time of our marriage. Yet in saying that, not believing that I have to wait for a specific Mr Right means that I could marry without looking back and thinking "should it have been that person? could it have been this person?". I know that God will sort it all out, and bring me into His will."Happily ever after" romantic marriageto Mr Right is  not  the purpose of life! It is a factor in life, but any married person will tell you that life is morethan marriage.  Other complicating factors include age -- I've heard people say "you'll never be ready anyway, so you might as well do it now", which I agree with to an extent. I don't think getting married any later would have been better for me. But I don't think getting married any earlier would have been clever either. I had the head knowledge that my husband could not fulfill all my needs as a person, and my identity was in God, but not the bitter disappointments of life that many older people have who  know  through experience that they cannot rely totally on anyone for fulfillment. In saying that, if I had learnt that through a boyfriend experience it mightcauseme to place my hope in future fulfillingrelationships, whereas to learn that within a safe marriage environment meant that I learnt it for this relationship -- to look to God and not to man.  I'm defensive about my state as a young married woman. I get sick of people assuming I'm domesticated and can bake. My husband and I are inidividuals, and we have learnt to let each other be individuals, and accept each other in this way. We have our own lives in a sense, as well as our joint lives. We have our own friends, and can let each other go in that sense. We are young university students, we are flatting, we do the dishes every3 or 4 days,we enjoy computer games and movies (rather than knitting and gardening) and going out with our friends -- individually or together. I'm so grateful to the friends that accept us as individuals, and as a couple too. I'm also grateful to my husband for teaching me this, in his own way, without realising it. So here's to young marrieds!
