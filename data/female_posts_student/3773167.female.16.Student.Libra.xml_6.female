I wish my parents had had the foresight to start a 529 college savings plan back when I was young.... it's really too late now, for me, but I signed them up to start saving for my youngest brother's college expenses.  Basically you just register your credit cards and grocery cards and then a percentage of everything you buy from participating companies, brands, and stores goes into your savings.  It's a small percentage, but over the course of 15 years it comes to a lot of money, especially if you invest the money you save for higher returns.  No hassle.  No risk.  I wish I was old enough (18) to apply for their Citi Upromise credit card.... they give you cash back into your savings on  everything  you buy.  Can't beat that.    Fortunately for me I've got the Florida Bright Future Scholarship to cover the brunt of my college expenses but it's still not clear how my two younger sisters will finance their college education.  Mom and Dad sure can't afford it, even though they'd love to.  One of them is thinking about joining the Army and paying for education that way, but in a lot of ways I'd almost rather her not go to college.  In my opinion, scholarship money is the wrong reason for anybody to join the service, especially somebody coming from an anti-Bush anti-war family like ours.
