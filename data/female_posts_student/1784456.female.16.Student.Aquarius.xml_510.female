I actually have a party plan now! Hey I have to go bug people about it. I have a theory, Izzy isn't coming on this so I won't bug her about Mr Fopple! Yeah, ok, so I suck with theories! Geez, why do we want to know about cubism again? What is it? Greeeat, reminds me of french, we spend a whole lesson doing stuff that we don't know any thing about... yeah... that makes no sense! But any way! Oh, every one remember Russian tomorrow, damn got Russian homework too! Dosvedanyaa or however you say it. Hey has any one found Russian character thingies on the computer? Tell me if you have! Did you see Neighbours Laura? Talk about :O :O :O
