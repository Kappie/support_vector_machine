I still haven' t tried the new Naruto game yet....it's not even out yet! oooh....I like Final Fantasy 7 and 9 the most.  I dont like 8 that much but the graphics are great.  Rhinoa is an interesting character too.  Squall is mute or something.  Squall scares me.  I wont be surprised if i dont scare anyone by talking about video games.  It seems like no one plays Final Fantasy at TFS.  What a shame.  I can't wait for 11 to come out.  I totally screwed up my new game in FF9.  I'm not that much of a perfectionist as the first time i played it.  The first time i played it i delivered every Mognet letter, Stallazzio and collected all the cards.  This time i botched the delivery.  I missed the first letter of Mognet, meaning that i can NEVER go to Mognet central and i forgot to pick up Stallazzios.  My game will be a failure.  I dont think Garnet's that pretty.  She looks ok.  Why do all the characters in the game make such a big deal about how she looks?  Are all characters shallow?  Maybe beauty is different for characters.  i think Vivi and the Mogs look so cute (especially Artemicion, the purple and vain Mognet mailmog.)None of the characters think they're cute.  I'll stop talking.  This is the last post 4 today.  Promise..
