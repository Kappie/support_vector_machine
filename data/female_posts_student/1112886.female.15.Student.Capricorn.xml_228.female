I'm really scared because there is a spider in my room and I saw it and I tried to kill it by throwing an algebra book at it but I missed because the algebra book was too heavy. So I tried hitting it with a lamp and I thought I got it but I didn't want to check under the lamp so I didn't. Then I wrote my essay and looked behind and there it was so I threw a physics book on it and I don't think I missed but I'm too scared to find out. I HATE ARACHNIDS.
