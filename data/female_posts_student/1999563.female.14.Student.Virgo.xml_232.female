I am like totally seeing signs. [haha..signs...:P ]  So I started laughing, like really hard. And my VC [Vanila Coke...haha] went THROUGH my NOSE! Hah!! it was FUNNY! But it kinda hurt...  Then..I went to like Math! and it was like totally blah!  I mean really, yuck!  I overheard a really scary conversation too..  I heard Evan talking to Eric and evan was all like "If I ask Meagan you ahev to ask Laura" And Eric was like "Ok!"  I was like totally scared!  Is that how you spell scared?  like "Ahh! That so scary!"   Yeah.  Then I went to Piano BUT I forgot my BOOKS!  I was so MAD! I was also really scared too.  Is that how you spell scared?  Well, anyways, so I hid in her bathroom and I was like crying. It was bad.  So she is making me have another lesson on thursday!! I was going to have to pay like 20 bucks for it but she was in a good mood so she didn't make me pay.  Like, totally close one!  So I went home and started on my homework.  Then my grandparents came over and we ate this nasty salad.. I just ate the fruit.  So I went upstairs and did this stupid poster for english, it took me like an hour and it looks ugly! [Like UGH!]  Uh oh...my mom says she needs me.. I will be right back...
