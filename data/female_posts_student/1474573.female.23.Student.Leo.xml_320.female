Instead of studying for a test, I now have to weed the front yard.  Shit like that bugs me out sometimes.  Yesterday I must have gone into shut-down mode because when I came home I crashed.  Fell asleep for over two hours and forced myself up.  Of course by around 10:30 I was wide awake.  I was tossing and turning in bed almost the whole night until about 6am, when I finally fell asleep only to wake up an hour later.  NICE!  So now I'm extra-specially blah!  whoo-hoo!!  In case anyone is curious, through numerous conversations with people that love me, I was reminded that everyone will do what they have to in due time.  They also pointed out the obvious, that no matter how hard I try, I cannot live other people's lives for them...so STOP STRESSING!!  Therefore I have.  Okay, so I wrote another 'I love you but you're ruining your life' email to my friend that's been stressing me but then I deleted it.  heh.  It's good to know other people's passwords sometimes...  So here I am.  Trying to get up the will to start filing before getting fired over it.  Wondering when fun people will get on AOL IM to distract me... thinking about Guy's possible 'swan song' tonight... hoping I'll have fun.  Wondering if we'll do anything afterwards...blah.
