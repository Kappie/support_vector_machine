I have...too many siblings. Ummm...I have some really awesome friends. Better known as Jenna, Court, Aaron, Chris, Drew, Britt...they will more than likely be mentioned alot on here. I'm secretary of TAG..aka Teen Actors Guild. I'm also secretary of WAG...aka Wee Actors Guild. I'm currently in the show Les Miserables which I am also assistant directing. My favorite color is burgendy. My hair is brown with blonde streaks until I decide what color i want to dye it next.hehe I'm addicted to dying my hair. Hmmm...what else is there to say about me? Oh yea...I'm short. I'm only 5'2. I guess that's all for this one...
