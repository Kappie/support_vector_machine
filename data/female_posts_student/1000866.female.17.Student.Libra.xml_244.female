"No, seriously, I'm fine."  Haha, I don't know what I'm doing that makes me seem sad. I mean, my back hurts a lot, so I'm trying not to move as much as I usually would, but I'm not sad. Oh man, tonight's going to be terrible, sleeping on the floor. Ow. I don't even want to think about that right now I don't think. Hmmm. It's hard to write how I'm feeling right now. I don't think I even know. I don't know how to explain it, so I guess it will stay locked away in my head. There's a lot of space up there for stuff like that. Hmmm, I need to go iron my shirt but I really don't want to. I wonder if there's something I can take for my back. Seriously, I feel like an old woman. I've already got white hair, and now my back...what's next? Dentures?  Ohhh, thunder.....  Scary.  Actually, I love storms. They're good when you want to think about something, but I think I'm in one of my moods where if I start thinking, I'll just upset myself. I don't want to be in a bummed out mood before I go to Kelly's. I guess I'll just go iron my shirt then, and get all my stuff ready and whatnot. Sigh. It will be fun, really.
