Ran into this little fabulous store called  urlLink Torrid . i Bought some really gorgous cluby cloths, for this weekend, that's if i go. Lots of things have changed for my plans this weekend (dells trip) usually that is not a good sign, but either way i have a cute new top and a cute new poncho/shaw, that I bought. Not to expensive either. usually when you get into plus sizes they rape you in price. today is a big tv night, simple life 2, quintaplets, and newlyweds/ashlee simpson show is on. I am planning on folding cloths during these show. i was so busy doing deep cleaning for christine's visit Iran behind on laudry about two weeks worth. Lots of folding, (the two biggest chores i hate are laudry and dishes(it never stops) and is never caught up.  I am really starting to become addicted to the show Nip/Tuck, that show just rocks, and who wouldn't want to see  urlLink Julian McMahon  naked he is so hott!!!! best of luck tomorrow shannon, don't forget to call if you want about absolutely anything, and gage is absolutely gorgous, don't forget to send me some more pictures.
