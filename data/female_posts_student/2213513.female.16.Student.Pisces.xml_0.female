Well, I left wednesday after school and got there at like 8. The next day was Turkey Day! and Lynzi was in Sunriver too so Ben and I went to meet up with her at the sled park. We had a nice snowball fight. Then we had a big dinner and I actually ate a lot this thanksgiving, usually I don't. Friday we went shopping, which was actually not bad considering it's the busiest day of the year shopping wise. I got new pants, lol, and shorts for PE and earrings and a necklace for winterball and Lynzi's xmas present! OMG I just realized I haven't watched the tape with Paul Walker on the View yet! I'll go watch it after this! Ok, so then saturday I did pretty much nothing and then got sick after dinner while we were driving to the Lodge, stayed in the car while everyone went inside. Then while everyone played Mexican Train I stayed in bed. (Mexican Train is a domino game, it takes too long to explain.) Oh, and we rented 2Fast 2Furious and Lord of the Rings, Two Towers on friday night and watched them both that night. I reccomend the 2Fast 2Furious DVD if you rent, it has some funny outtakes. Also we played UNO thursday night, which got kind of violent. We learned a bunch of new rules though and I played where you keep score and stuff, which was weird! OH and my camera doesn't work still, which im pissed about! Anyway, I'm out. See ya later! *Kate ~love is like a role that we play PS: OMG IM SO MAD I DIDNT EVEN GET TO GO SNOWBOARDING WHILE I WAS THERE!
