It hangs around my neck on a cord so my hands are kept free for writing or typing while the object below me is magnified 2x.  The CNIB had magnifiers that go up to 10x but you lose space as the magnification increases and for now, I don't think I need them.  If my needs change, though, it's good to know there are many more options.   They also had lamp/magnifier combinations so you can adjust your light and magnifier according to your needs.  Very clever.  So, while I may feel like a dork for needing the device I got, I feel more confident about my ability to read my textbook for Psych.    More to come...
