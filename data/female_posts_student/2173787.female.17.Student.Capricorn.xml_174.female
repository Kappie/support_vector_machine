Sheikh Yassin was a most dangerous terrorist chief. his elimination today I’m sure in the long run, will ensure the stability of this region. Because with a weakened Hamas, I believe, I believe it will be easier to restore stability to our region.  Obviously Hamas is not dead and continues to exist as a very dangerous terrorist organization, but Hamas has been weakened and will be weakened without its leader.  We cannot forget that Sheikh Yassin was the founder of Hamas and of its terrorist ideology.  He is personally responsible for ordering the most dreadful terrorist attacks in Israel, like in the …2 yrs ago, which killed 30 people, like in Café Moment in Jerusalem which killed 25 people.  Here we have with his disappearance now, I believe, an opportunity to weaken an extremely dangerous organization, which has proven over the last few years, that its only aim is the destruction of the state of Israel and of its inhabitants.  As you remember, Hamas declared, a few months ago, a ceasefire, which was immediately broken on the order of Sheikh Yassin.  Sheikh Yassin was a dangerous, an extreme of Islamic ideologies.  I believe that he was a threat, not only to Israel, but to the entire region.  I believe that in the least, without Sheikh Yassin, that in the long run, it will be a better place to live.  There might be some difficulties, momentarily we see, of course, what’s going on in Gaza, but we are convinced that by eliminating this threat to peace we will improve conditions in the Middle East for the future.    –Avi Pazner, Israeli Government Spokesman
