His eyes stared straight into me, and i knew what he wanted. I could have done it, right there.  ...  But I'm sick of regrets. I walk a thin wire right now, and if i don't make some desicions soon, that wire is going to break and snap me in the face. Its a metal wire too. Thats going to hurt like a bitch.   why is it true that girls always like the "bad boys"? the ones they can't have...why do we crave the unabtainable? I've been exploring this mystery for some time now and its driving me stark raving mad. Mad i tell you.  ...  I saw Dan today at the pita pit while Genie and I were dancing around downtown. God he's gorgeous, I've thought so for years. One small problem though, yeah. His girlfriend of 4 years.  My plan? Corruption corruption sudduction. Wanting the unobtainable, craving it.  I've gotten over that, but all the same. That crazy craving. Ridiculous. Even though I should be hateing on Nate right now, i wish he would just fucking give me a call.  ...Jeez.
