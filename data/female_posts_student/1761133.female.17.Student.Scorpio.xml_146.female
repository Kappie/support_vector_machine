Your emotions are more stable than usual, so open up and speak from your heart. Also, listen. What you learn will be extremely valuable for the future, so pay attention. Keep an eye on what is real, but feel free to let your heart explore all the possibilities. Follow your emotions and trust your instincts. You stand to gain a great deal.
