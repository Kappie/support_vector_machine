I don't belong here  I don't care if it hurts I want to have control I want a perfect body I want a perfect soul I want you to notice When I'm not around You're so fucking special I wish I was special  But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here  Whatever makes you happy Whatever you want You're so fucking special I wish I was special  But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here I don't belong here.  Rhedyn "Nevermore"
