I've never been ice skating before..and so after get convinced by Harmony, Ashley, and Kat..I tried to put some skates on, but I fell over as soon I as put them on and stood up. So I decided to go on the rink in my flipflops because Corbin was doing it too...haha. Well then Harmony was trying to get me to "skate" but that didn't go very well. Then we had to get off the rink because there was a hockey game that was going to take place. So then I got in the pool. The pool was fun..people jumping off the diving board and then people going up and down the waterslide (I didn't go up it though..haha)..and it was fun. Then the foam surfboard was fun even though Drew hitted me..but everything is alright ;). I had to go home because no only was it getting cold but Rachael and Lucas wanted to go home (they didn't swim). But yeah is was fun. I just hope I don't get a cold because I will be screaming at John Mayer and Maroon 5 tommorrow :)...Wow this has been an awesome week and the best part is tommorrow. I've been waiting for this for a few months and it's finally here! yeah! Yeah..I'm heading off soon..later :)
