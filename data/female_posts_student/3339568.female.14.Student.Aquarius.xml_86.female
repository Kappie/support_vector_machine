That was very nice. :D Me being the weird eater I am could hardly consume anything (no surprise 4 me in the morning!) We saw Bec and Pete H there, which was kinda random. And also sum random Swedish exchange student with a cool accent!! I love accents! :) That Swedish guy has almost become a personal joke at school already. Hmmm...its quite strange how personal jokes are made very quickly at our school! Neway, I'm getting a tad off the topic here!! Moving on, after brekkie, I went home, Dad picked me up which was good becuase I wasn't looking forward 2 a long hike home. Hehe, mi Dad is soo random! Becuase he dropped me at Macca's, he thought I was actually going there 4 brekkie! All I can say is Eeew! and Dad ur a strange one! So i got home, after waiting in the cold for a while and having a random nice converstaion with this random lady on the street about the weather, and Gemma came over when I got home. :D Yay. We put our application in for Coles Myer! So then Monty came and picked us up, and we walked 2 Glenrose, and bought food (we saw Abby Jansen there, gosh her face hasn't changed one bit but she is so much taller! She looks jsut like her sis!) then we headed off to the park. Nat and T2 (Buckley) came shoon after. But then it started 2 pour, so we rushed into the Church. We didn't really have much 2 talk bout, that was kinda strange. Then we ate a bit more and they left, so it was jsut Monty and Gemmie and me. Then T1 (McCloud) came, this is where the fun began!! I think that T1 brings out the dirtiness in Monty, because all out talk turned dirty, from "rim jobs" to "losingthe paddle" and "rowing", we said it all baby!! Fun had bi all. The lumberjack Monty Python song came up as well, seeing as Monty was wearing his "lumberjack jacket" as he so affectionatley put it. And much 2 T1's amusement I showed him mi felxibility skills. :P And I did this spontaneously funny impression of Pete Hayes. I was sitting at the drum kit, and I pulled mi jumper hood right over mi head like Pete always does and randomly hit the drums with my head down whilesaying "Mi name is Pete and I'm a great drum player!" Yes, I know, it was quite mean, but I don't think I ever got over that Bible bashing incident, and the impression sure was funny!!Hehe.I feel slightly guilty. :P Neway, I ended up having 2 go (becuase i was getting mi Hep A needle later! Argh!) so the guys walked me home. When we got 2 mi street, Monty spied the pile of things outside mi neighbors yard, ready 4 council cleanup, after rummaging around in there 4 a while, he jumped out and proudly produced a bunch of golf clubs. He stood there grinning at us, and we realised how much he looked like a hobo! Honestly, he had these black trackpants on, a red checked "lumberjack" shirt, shoes that looked like he'd found them on the side of the road, a pair of golf clubs swung over his shoulder, crazy hair, and the  perfect  hobo grin.Oh the hilarity of it. So basically my day spent bumming at the Church was filled with many, many laughs. Ahh, ya gotta luv those guys!  Bloggin off,  Beth
