I just played the piano a lot and played a little on Xbox Live. The funniest thing happened, though, last night. Late last night. You see, we found this free trial membership for Xbox Live, so we figured we'd make another account just for fun. We spent about an hour and a half coming up with random stupid nicknames because we couldn't decide on a good one. Finally, I just picked one and went to the next step to enter the activation code on the card. The code was rejected. So I looked at the back of the card, and it turned out that the thing expired back in March. What a waste of time. It angers me that they actually put expiration dates on the cards.     Last song I listened to:   Big Apple Heartbreak  by Yellowcard.   Last album I listened to:   One For The Kids .   Last meal I ate:  Nachos.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Don't know.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Once again, I don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Steph.   Favorite song today:   The Luckiest  by Ben Folds.   Favorite food today:  Don't know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Wasted an hour and a half of my life trying to come up with a good gamertag on XBL. But it was still funny because everything gets funny when it's that late at night.   Funniest thing that happened today:  David managed to fall over in both directions in his chair, hitting his elbow first off the drumset and then off a plastic storage tub.
