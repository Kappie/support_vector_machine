Tonight the boy wanted a back rub! I'm like listen here DOG, I'm not ur homeboy's gilfriend/miscues...I'm a waitress! Oh yea, about that. Man, I gotta work tomorrow and Saturday...BUT the problem with that is I have no VOICE! So I wonder how the Nyugens will take that. Oh well. They'll just have to deal.   I think I'm also getting better with trusting Andrew. He pretty much called me out the other night saying that everytime I call or everytime I do something it always is to catch him doing something. Like basically, catch him with another girl. Man, I was so shocked he could tell..bc that was EXACTLY what I was doing; I guess it was a lot more obvious than I thought. Because he looks like a player, bc of all the girls he talks to, relating to drug deals or not, it just seems that way. But since he told me he's not like that, and he's not gunna treat me that way I feel a whole lot better. I still get jealous when he talks to other girls and shit but not as bad. He gets pissed when his homeboys even so much as look at me! Its so adorable. Like tonight with Ruben and victor..."Watch out bitch, don't talk to my girl like that!" that's ur girl? " yea bitch, that's my girl!" vulgar I know, but so cute when u hear him say it in person. OMG! And with the whole bob thing.." Yea I got ur girl now, what u gunna say?" I LOVE IT! He's finally not giving a fuck anymore and just putting our relationship out there. That makes me feel a whole lot better. Do you really think I flirt with hector a lot? I really don't I think. I cant help flirting a little, that's just who I am, but other than that I don't fuck with him. I like talking to him, and joking around with him, just like I do Eric, its nothing new. bc I DEFF. Don't want either of them, I just want Andrew. Man he's a good ass fuck. mmmmmmmmmm...Just thinking about it makes me horny! Anyway! Wow, back to the real world. I was kinda mad at myself that I basically admitted to Chris yesterday that I fuck Andrew. I know he's gunna think about that, and dwell on that for a good while. Maybe if I apologize...Yea, cuz then hell know it wasn't intentional. BUT, if he hasn't thought about it, and just brushed it off, then hell start thinking about it. DAMNED IF I DO, DAMNED IF I DON'T. Oh well.
