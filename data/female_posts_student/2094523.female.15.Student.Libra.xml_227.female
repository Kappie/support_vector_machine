Your promises were the only thing I need, Took those words and poisoned another ear Thought the secrets were only meant for me to hear But I’m degraded, I’m a disgrace I can’t please you, can’t be erased.  Took awhile for me to realize Words are nothing but lies.  Fake deception meant for your mind Complete illusion meant to blind. Drank your blood wishing to become closer to you Choked down that crimson but further apart we grew.  Yet my hands are tightly grasping to your wilted flowers Insanity beginning to devour My eyes searches for your presence to appear Finding nothing but a blur of tears  Lips reach out longing for your touch Am I begging pleading for too much? I only want what you promised me  But your black black heart cannot be free.  My happiness was based upon lies and more lies Those words I trusted were merely a disguise    Did you believe all those words that bled from my lips?  Toxic lies that might have slipped The words that I poisoned in your ear  They swim, they drown, they disappear How long must it take you to realize? My words were nothing but lies.
