I was so embarrassed today.  haha.  my mom is in a mozart phase.  jack is tired of always coming over and listening to mozart.  jack thinks my mom is a bit too into classical music.  I told him so.  [he didn't believe me.]  I skipped lunch today.  then I wasn't hungry at dinner.  hmm.  fauvist suns and chained women!  joy.  that would be jack's painting and my painting, btw.  =)  and now... sleep.  [are these outline forms of my day good or bad?]
