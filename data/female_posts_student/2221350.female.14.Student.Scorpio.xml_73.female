The reason I haven't blogged lately is because I've had so much on my mind the thought of putting it on paper scared me, but it's Friday night and, of course, I have nothing to do, so here goes.  we finally finished testing. It was the easiest one I think I've ever taken and I can't believe it's all I have to pass to get my diploma.   mom is leaving for Los Angeles on Sunday. For me this is extremely upsetting. Although I am not sure whether it's because she relishes rubbing it in my face in the most childish of manners or if I feel bad for not being happy for her. everytime she launches into one of her stupid "I'm going to Los an-gel-es" songs, I all of a sudden wan bawl my eyes out. Maybe it's because I can't imagine a mother being so immature and childish or if I want to go THAT badly.  while on the subject of my mother I suppose I will launch into the very pitiful movie pouting whining mom is mean THING. She said she would take me to see the Johnny depp movie with her and this made me happy. Well some plans didn't work out, there was a misunderstanding, and she ended up not taking me. I didn't really mind since I didn't really need to be checked out of school, and I figured we could do it Friday night. So Friday rolls around and she is going to see the movie with beau. Remember beau, the really awesome quantum physics dude from Mardi gras? Well anyways, she's been hanging out with  beau  all week. Hearing this, I immediately ask if I can join them expecting a yes since he is kind of my friend also but she says no. So I keep bothering her and she still says no. This REALLY hurt my feelings. I thought we would have a little mother-daughter time before she left to go to the only place I've wanted to go since I could form coherent thoughts. But NoOoOoO! She wants to spend all her time with somebody else.   I hate this. I hate the way she rubs it in. I hate the way she's having dinner with Mel Gibson and rubs that in the most. I hate the way she won't take pictures or go to anywhere that matters. I hate the way she tries pacifying me by promising to bring back miniature soap from her stupid fancy hotel. I hate the way she's not even gonna visit the museum or the walk of fame. I hate the way this is bothering me so much but it wouldn't be bothering me so much if it weren't THIS place.   why would I lose a phalange to go there? Because stuff is happening. Because it's not a desolate wasteland where people are too lazy to even try to make themselves happy. Because it's the opposite of Shreveport. The fact that all of those wonderful movie stars and landmarks and interesting things to do are there helps too.   alright, I think I'm done whining about that. Doing all this yammering isn't going to get her to come home from that stupid movie and apologize. Besides, mammaw says I can go see it with her on Sunday afternoon((oh, joy...)). And it's not that I don't like being with mammaw, it's just that this was supposed to be a caitlin-mom thing. No arguing, no sharing with anyone else.   that movie will suck anyways... And so will her trip... ((not))((not))  I got invited to go to a boys house and do some drugs and other stupid crap like that. He told me to call him on Thursday but I didn't. I think I will tell him I got food poisoning. Besides the fact that I don't wanna do that sort of thing, I would be the only girl there with like.. 4 guys. It would be weird.  on Wednesday, I got a horrible feeling. My stomach dropped and all I could think about was that shane had been hurt and I couldn't imagine why I would think that since I haven't really talked to him in forever. I haven't been able to get a hold of him, so that "feeling" is still churning my guts, making me wonder if he fell off a cliff. Well since we don't actually have cliffs in Shreveport, it would have to be something less glamorous, like getting run over. Hopefully I'll talk to him eventually and I will quit thinking about it. Like when he gets out of the hospital or when my grandmother finds his obituary in the paper...  why DOES my grandmother read the "obitz"((as she likes to call them))?? Does it make her feel more alive?  I had a dream this morning that I was taken hostage with a whole bunch of kids and I had to pretend that I wanted to get married to some girl I didn't know so that I could escape and give this thingy back to Bernie Mac so that he could save the world. It was kind of weird, and I've had a similar dream before.   when I'm a senior I'm going to take psychology. I know I would love psychology. One of these days I will read a book on Freudian psychology. He was a genius, he may have been a little off on some stuff, but he was still an innovator.
