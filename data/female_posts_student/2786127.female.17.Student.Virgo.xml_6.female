So i was on the phone WAY to much today and for some reason i've really grown a strong dislike for the phone as a means of conversation. Tim called to see how my weekend was, babbled about that for quite some time. *unfortunatly* I didnt get to hear about his because Nate showed up to say hello. So i got off the phone and watched a little bit of the 'ball...football...superbowl...stuff. Many a time I've watched a football game and still i have no idea what goes on it that game. I just made fun of the replay action, slowmotion big chunky men in WAY to tight of pants...fat slowly jiggling from side to side...um, ew. While i was laughing about that my dad and my uncle were yelling random "oooohhh yeeeeahh" s from the other room and a few "WOOOOO!!!"s to go with them. Football is a strange thing indeed.    But back to the phone. So Nate was sitting around *entranced* by the big beefy men tackling each other while i was contemplating weather or not i should go in the family room and steal that last sugar cookie sitting on the table when Genie called and saved me from certain cookie fat doom. I talked to her awhile about her strange incident with her treadmill and a semi-"special" kid that came over with a bunch of her other friends. He had a mullet, and was approaching the lovely "obesity" stage of his life apparently. Long story short the kid fell flat on his face while jogging on the tread mill and chipped his too front teeth. So now the kids got a lot of good things going for him, I mean, seriously...he's got a kick ass haircut, lots of fat to keep him warm this winter, "Friends" that only keep him around because its fun to make him do stupid things, and NOW he has carnie teeth. I wish i could find a guy like that, thats definatly hot.   SO THE PHONE. Genie let me go, I let nate go, and then i had to talk to tim some more. SO talking talking, told him i had to do math homework, he let me go. Makenzie doesnt want me to get good grades in school so she called me almost the minute after i had gotten off with tim. Disscussed some things with her, found out theres a chem test tommorow... she was the bringer of bad news, so i told i her i must leave and i hung up.  So, i guess i just don't like the phone. Haha...what a great story about apsolutly nothing.  hmm. I should sleep. I get to go dress shopping this week (!) Dances are my favorite things ever. -Jesska (as jon would call me, its apparently my new nickname that i had no idea about.)
