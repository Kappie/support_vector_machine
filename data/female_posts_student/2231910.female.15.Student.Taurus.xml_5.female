Does she really treat me as her _____ ? Or she just need a person to company her and i am the one? I really had enough... i feel like crying everytime. Why cant she make the first move for ONCE? Why cant she? Actually i also dun noe wat type of friendship is this? Is she still considered as my best fren after tat qurral in primary school? Or wat? I really sick and get tired. Why must i pleased her everytime ? How long should i remain like this? Can someone pls tell me wat i should do....... I say Sorry to her and she didnt say tat magic word back to me and say " nvm lah". AM i always in the wrong? Am i ..... sometimes i doubt abt our relationship. She dun noe wat i am thinking in the every moment, and i knew. She dun noe tat among all my fren she hurt me the most. She really dun noe.... Alysia said something today and it make sense to me, " those pple who is our enemy tends to understand us the most and the best fren is always the one who doesnt understand us". Is she really my true best fren or my best fren is my enemy? I am so damn confuse. Not going on ...
