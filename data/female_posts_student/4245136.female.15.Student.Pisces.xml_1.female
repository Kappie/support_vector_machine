I just came in from twirling fire batons, and oddly, I got mobbed by mosquitoes (normally, I never get bitten).  I'm pretty psyched about the first game and pretty nervous.  I have invited Anna to join me in parenting my "baby".  She should join in soon enough.  My classes for the first six weeks are, in order, Combined studies:Enlgish, Combined studies: history, Latin I and Band.  I am excited to meet new people this year, especially new guys, no one I know at the moment meets my standards and vice versa, I'm pretty sure.  However, I am confident that this year will not be like last year.  I smell like lamp oil and smoke.  Well kids, I'll post again soon, so not to worry, I'll make sure you don't get lonely and discouraged.  ta ta!
