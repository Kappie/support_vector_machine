" Force (pause) Elite (pause) the best in the state, (pause) Red, black, and white (use team colors)(pause) first rate.       Blogging on here, MelissaNSC is our cheerleading coach, as you can see Beth and i weren't expecting her as a coach, we were expecting a blonde bimbo or a nerd with a retainer. Instead we were stuck with Melissa, a vulumptous furious chick who thinks we can't count to 3!  We arrived at the church anxious of her arrival but there she was with her bland navy blue trackpants and a baggy sweat shirt she flicked her dirty black hair and said HIT IT! OMG, no! We didn't no what we were in for.. thats when Beth discovered a picture that looked exactly like her on a website, with the exception of no glasses. Beth and i printed the picture off and in cheerleading placed it beside her CD Player..waiting for an outcome, half way through the class she said:  "Ok Guys jokes over, you've done your research it is me..it is me (pause) Who's Beth, who's beth? (laughter could be heard in the background) Who is Beth? Are you Beth!  It was so funny! More updates on MelissaNSC..next friday!"   Haha, seriously good personal joke times!
