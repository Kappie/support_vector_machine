In the opening scene in the move the lighting is poor and everything is dark and hard to see. In the book, comrad uses dark terminology, like gloomy, and dark.I think that the director wanted to reflect this in the movie by using dark lighting as often as possible. He wanted to stay true to the books purpose.
