You don’t believe in reality  Because you love hearing those lies When he told you that he loved you  Those lies are in your veins  You love hearing fantasies Never grow out of your childhood. Forever are those imaginary games  I guess for you it is never too old.    So when will the time come  Before you spill your soul on him When will the time come  Before you begin to feel these lies.   I want to tell you that this is not real The life you lead is just a fairy tale But what is it to you? You’d just think it were more lies.
