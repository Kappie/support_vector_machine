So now from 7-9 I can't be studying history.   Woke up a bit because Mom was going through an old tin of pens and pencils. I'm sleeping, damnit. Please make the noise louder so I sleep better. And then she has to yell at me three times in a row for mistakenly taking bath towels to the car wash. And then right after, she and the housekeeper start that annoying habit of continually calling people to dinner. I wish we could go to dinner whenever we wanted. It's apparently not enough to have two sitting at the table, all must be present despite varying degrees of hunger.  Watched the beginnings of Shattered Glass in journalism. Thought it would be over my head, like All the President's Men was (even with Zach's commentary), but this is strangely appealing. I will even go as far as to confess that I like the geeky charm of Hayden Christiansen enough to feel cheated when he started making facts up. I don't think I'll see the end, though. Normal school won't see me until next Tuesday.  Oh, what a life.
