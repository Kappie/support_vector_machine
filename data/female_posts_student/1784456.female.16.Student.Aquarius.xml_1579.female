I wnet onto www.dot.tk, to hopefully make my own webby, with my own domain name for FREE! and they have gone and bloody said that you have to be 18 and over to sign up. How unfair?! so i am just gonna have to stick to my crappy geocities one... www.geocities.com/fluorescent_frog Don't ask about it being fluorescent frog, its supposed to be like pink pather but no one ever picks up on it, so neva mind, no one goes on it anyway cos its soo crap and i haven't up dated it for about 3 months!!! aaah well, thats my complaint. More under 18 websites for creating websites for free!!! xoxox
