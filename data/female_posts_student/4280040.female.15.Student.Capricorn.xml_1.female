Except for the time when we ran into the stinkin' thorn tree or whatever it was. We both got scratched up by that thing. It sucked. But yes, with only a few trees in our way, we did a pretty dag on good job canoeing. It only took us about 3 hours to complete this obstacle course they call the Mad River. Wee! I can't wait till next year's trip.      We went back to the church at around 3ish. Then we just sat around for a while, waiting for Jennifer and stuff to get back with the food, which was about 5 when they actually arrived. Those were also good times. This whole day has been pretty awesome. Ah. I freakin' love my youth group. Everyone is so awesome, and we have so much fun together. I love you guys!
