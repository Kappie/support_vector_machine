So I missed out on a chance to see Elliott in shorts, although I didn't know he existed at that point.  I first met him on the 3rd September, at the school shop.  I thought he went to Henry's until one day I saw him at school, and I was like, "OH MY GOD, IT'S SEXY SEXY SCHOOL SHOP BOY."  Then he caught me pointing at him, staring at him, and gesturing at him to show Pooj who he was, when we asked him what his name was.  Soo embarrassing ...  Mimble wimble.  I can't be bothered to say anything.  Anything that CERTAIN PEOPLE can read anyways.    There is noo point in this now.  There's something that I'm bursting to say, but I just can't say it *spazzes* but I really want to.  Ooh, this isn't fair!!  He's online, but I can't add him, because then ... then he'll know I added him, which would not be good for the economy!  I have his email address, but I can't just do something so - I don't know ... obvious - like adding him!!  Cruel, cruel world.  Why do you tempt me so?  See you later, computater (don't ask), *~Jools~*
