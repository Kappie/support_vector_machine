I think I'm sick again : (  I woke up in the middle of the night Friday night and my throat hurt SO BAD... so, yesterday after I got home from lab (when it wasn't any better) I said something to my Mom.  She told me to try some Zicam spray.  It tastes like booty, but I already feel like it's helping.  It's that medicine that's supposed to shorten the length of the 'common cold.'  Hopefully it works... because I'm tired of being sick!    I have a fair amount of math homework to do today... I don't feel like doing it b/c it's Superbowl Sunday!  I'm not even rooting for a team, but I like football... so I wanna watch it... plus, I like the commercials and halftime entertainment... ;)  I watched  urlLink Center Stage  again last night...  I love that movie.  It takes me back to my dancing days... I miss dancing.  Maybe I'll throw some into my working out routine.  It's good aerobic work and I enjoy it so it won't really seem like I'm working out.  Well, I'm going to go... it's almost time for Sunday Dinner.  We always eat early on Sundays...
