I woke up at 10-ish and tired to get up but I was to sick to get out of bed... lol. Funny stufff. ;) So i turned on my radio and read for about an hour. They never played I Belong To You....sad sad...very sad.  So I finally decided to get up and use the computer. So I got on for about an hour. It was fun. I love computers. The rest of the day I have walked around aimlessly and done absolutely nothing. My brother is sick so we couldn't clean today.  Now I am off to yet new glasses *woot* Happy happy joy joy.   I am going to the mall.  Yay  Love, Laura Fantora
