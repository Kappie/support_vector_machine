The comments of old didn't make the transition (it would have been tacky and bugged me to no end, trust me...it's better this way), but that seems to be the only sacrifice.  The links finally have their place on the side bar and there's less white space than usual.  I realize the type is small, and that might receive some attention at some point.  But not tonight.  Have GI Jane on TBS and we're quickly becoming engrossed.    Still waiting for the hair to grow out.  The EMP (in Seattle) baseball cap might be making regular appearances.    Seriously, we're talking an '80s aerobics instructor.  I should get my own video.
