(ok that was a lame attempt at a rhyme)  Hell yea i am coming to your pre-prom thingery... you can expect me sometime around 6-6.30, moreso on the earlier side. Additionaly, Carlie, is it ok if Brian drives to your house and leaves his car there since Jason is drving us in his car??  what else, what else... Oh yea, Egg Fight Information for those who have not heard it: Billy's idea (not taking credit for a cool idea that is not mine) is as follows:  *wear clothes you dont care about getting dirty, cover yourself with a trashbag so as to provide somewhat shielding from stuff. *go to park (or whatever) and throw raw eggs at eachother, basically.  COME ON you know it would be fun...  ... and I mean, what better way to end an evening of being all pretty than something that doesn't require you to look your best? cause I am sure by then we will be out of Pretty-mode, hehe. Amber said she wants to do the egg fight thing too, cause we talked about it in crafts. hehehe. And Ryan and Billy are up for it. Me too, of course. Who else?  Also... I am thinking staying for the ENTIRE prom is a little much, too, but i figure we will see when we get there. I mean, if it is really exciting, hell, i'd stick around, but if not, yea, i am leaving. Basically, i say, we leave it open to interpretation. (like the constitution!! haha)
