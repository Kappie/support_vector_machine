(and Carol and I beat Mike and James!), and went in the pool and hot tub. Then we went over to Ward's and got ice cream.  Today I went to my grandma's house before the Math regents. Then I went to take the Math regents. I'm pretty sure I failed it. It was really friggen hard! Then I came home and Molly called so I talked to her for a while. I heart that girl! Don't worry what everyone thinks about you Molly, if you ever need anyone to talk to I'm here for you! Then I watched Love Actually. It's a very good movie. I would recommend it. It made me think, am I ever going to find anyone that will love me unconditionally? I'm starting to think that I never will. I'm such a hopeless romantic. I just want a guy that won't treat me like crap and take time to actually get to know me and like me for who I am. Is that to much to ask for?   So right now I'm talking to Jon. Tomorrow morning is the Chemistry regents and Laura's B-day party.  Listening to: [Memory by Sugarcult]   This may never start. We could fall apart. And I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear.  Feelings insincere. Can I be your memory?  So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.  This may never start. I'll tear us apart. Can I be your enemy. Losing half a year. Waiting for you here I'd be your anything.  So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.  This may never start. Tearing out my heart. I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear. (I'd be your memory) Feelings disappear. Can I be your memory?  So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.  This may never start. We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear. Feelings insincere. Can I be your memory?
