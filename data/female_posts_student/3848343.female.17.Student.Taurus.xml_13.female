She was chucking a tantrum and well where do they decide to put her....in her room of course.... WHICH HAPPENS TO BE MY ROOM ALSO... so i was trying to sleep with a toddler shouting....i got up picked her up, put her on the otherside of the door and shut it..only to be woken up by my step mum saying to clean the bathroom again....i was like FINE...so i got up, got dressed, cleaned the bathroom and within 30mins of being awake i had already walked over to my mums house....i had to get out of that hell hole...so i was on the net and phone waiting for jenny to come over but it took her like a whole hour to decide wat she was gonna wear..anyway once she arrived we did more chatting and then caught the bus to hurzy (yes we love the place)....in hurzy we shopped for Laylas bday present...we got her this mad volcom top....i want it lol....made jenny try it on but had to check to see if laylas boobs would fit so we made jenny stick her hands up it just to check it out lol...sorry jen i will stop talking about ur boobs...hahhaah..anyway yeh we sat and ate food, picked up photos and well jenny and i shouted out the word "disgusting" i dont know how many times to the asian that works at thejuice station in hurzy but yeh he was killing us...he must like abuse casue he gave us 2 free juice evern after we were shouting at him...got to love it!!

WE WERE PACKIGN IT!!!  Not to worry we arrived safely...i think everyone thoguht we were drunk though because we were kinda loud, were singing and falling over each other hahahah...so we had fun at oatley park... gave layla her present which she loved...so happy about that..... i climed to the top of the castle with jenny and a collection of twigs, stones and a log HAHAHAHA and started thowing them at people hahaha...if that log hit anyone it could have killed them but meh it was alll good =).... i went bush bashing with jenny and we sat on a rock with jess and were being picked up by these year10/11 kids from newington and waverlly....one of them was hot...darn jenny we missed out on goign to there house  *cough*  sorry the fake party  *cough*.. its at 261 Connells Pt Rd Connells point if anyone wants to turn up hahaha....to bad they were so gay aye lol...didnt matter we still had fun...jen and me started rumbling but not normal rumbiling we were doign it while trying to run up hills made of bark....hahahah funniest thing out lol..jenny is a lil rough kid i swear she just kept pulling me down the lil shit...we then had cake....was soooo yummy...good old chocolate cake...
