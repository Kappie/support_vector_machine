Things has been simmering between us. I never really thought of it as serious. The fact that we seldom share our troubles. That we have a communication problem. Maybe I knew, I was just running away from it Because its easier to ignore.  Until he broke his silence and told me that he was not happy in this relationship. That he feels that I take him for granted. That I don't love him enough. I admit that I'm one of those people whom when busy, I'll totally shut out everyone. I'll forget to call, forget to return sms.. I forget to care about him, how his day was. And always talking about my problems and neglecting his own. Not caring to ask how his day was, expecting him as ok. He feels that I don't put in enough commitment. THat I don't love him. He says he's unhappy and wants me to change. To stop being so selfish. We had a huge quarrel over it. Words that I never wanted to hear again were exchanged.  He got mad and said I don't love him enough. He said I'm selfish and love myself the most. That I always expect him to pacify me, but I never cared for his feelings. I do what I wanna do and I'm wilful. And being petty, with my small insignificant problems. When I didn't even ask him how his day was in the first place. That I'm a bad girlfriend. Am I? Maybe I am.  It is a wonder how a person who says the sweetest words can end up saying the most horrible words in the end.  He said so much yesterday. I never really knew him. I was in a dream, thinking everything was ok. When he was so unhappy, I was so insensitive. I never even cared if he was sad that day. I never bothered asking. Its my fault. But yesterday, the words were too hurtful. It left a crack I know will never heal. That nothing will be ok again. He began churning out things from the past. That I will come crying to him when I'm having stress.. About my ex contacting me. He was there for me all along. I was always absent in his life. When he's sad I don't even care. I never thought he kept so much resentment inside him for so long. Its my fault for being insensitive to his feelings. I'm so tired. So tired of this relationship. Handling schoolwork is taking over my life. Maybe I have really neglected him alot.  I have no intention of hurting him further. I never thought i had hurt him that much.  I have no courage to face myself. I still have a major project coming up. I can't bear to break down, stop and reflect. My performance will affect everyone in my project group. I can't afford to let them down, not after seeing how much effort they have put in. I can't bear to disappear from my responsibilities. Maybe I'm selfish. For spending too much effort on my studies n myself, that I put him second. I don't deserve his love  For now, I only want to focus on my studies. I know that things is going to be hard for me. Whatever it was, I chose this path myself. I shall continue walking. I must be strong.
