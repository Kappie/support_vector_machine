I think the dinner would have been too much for him. Reminders of old times, a very pissed-off princess (who is soon to be no more - someone comes to senses), desires for "the good stuff", crying crying and more crying, etc.  *ASIDE* Okay. I had this conversation with BIB while atlblingbling was in the shower. I told him how the princess hates me because she overheard me dissin' her when i was talking to boy on the phone (I mentioned that she was ridiculous for putting up with his baggage, especially when he basically put that shit - roller duffel, suit bag and all- right in the middle of her living room. I know it's a bad metaphor but hang with me folks...it's been a rough couple of months.)   I only remembered yesterday that boy never said, "Look, Wild Honey, that's my girlfriend you're talking about. Please refrain from saying such things..." Not that he would phrase it like that, but you know what I mean. He just sat there silently and then responded with, "Sounds like you're hurt. Please, just calm down. I don't want either of us to regret what we're saying..." On other occasions - when I referred to her as wildhoney lite - he would just laugh and say, "That's a funny name. Who came up with that one? Peter?" BIB thinks he's not serious. I agree. But I also know what that's like. Sometimes, you just gotta drown your sorrows in a rebound person. ***  Anyway, I had a book that I thought he'd like to read. I wanted to drop it by before bedtime. So I called him after drink (this is key) and before dinner with Atlblingbling and BIB.   I told him that if the lights were off, I would just come by the next day to drop off a book/gift. He agreed that he needed reading material for Angola because when he's not avoiding landmines (!) and chumming it up with his sexist colleagues(remnants of a portuguese colonial past?), he has lots of down time. It doesn't surprise me actually, because he used to be bouncing off the walls with happiness, and had trouble immediately expressing himself in English (his native language, he's from Massachusetts) when I called him there: "Phone sex? Phone sex?"   So, the porch light was on. All others were off. I hit the doorbell, unsure if some obnoxious theme song would be playing.(You never know with this guy, really). He came downstairs in the t-shirt/boxer shorts combination, and we stood together in the requisite pile of junk in his living room. As he rubs sleep out of his eyes - or pretends to - I look around the house.   Since my last time in the house, he's put in recessed lights, has absorbed some of my wood carvings into his little African statue collection, has purchased more tables on which to house more junk...   We talk for some time and keep it clean. We have a lot of physical contact in the form of goodbyes. I acknowledge the good job I did in picking curtains, painting walls, contributing to his junk... I also notice that despite all these touches of mine, I don't *exist* in the house anymore. There's no more of me. And I say so. Boy says,  "A bit of you will always be here in the house."  I shake my head, like I am not so sure. I see his eyes well up with tears and I say,  "Aw, how sweet... now, are you going to take off your shorts, or shall I?"  But we both know better.  That night, after this long goodbye, I went home and watched Six Feet Under [link] on DVD.
