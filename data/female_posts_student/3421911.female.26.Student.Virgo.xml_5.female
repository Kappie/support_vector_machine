Robin Williams'  carpe diem  got me pretty bad.  i like flirting with people, men and women alike, because there's something terribly exciting with playing with a person's head. i mean, mind. it makes you more creative.  but i can be very bad.  how bad?  i don't go around breaking young guys'(girls'.  jeez, straight out of Michael Jackson's billie jean.  never saw that coming) hearts.  i just get a morality attack and all of a sudden what sounded like a great  hot  idea doesn't appeal to me anymore. hence, the term EBTG or teaser.  it hurts the other person to a certain extent but i don't really seem to care. i don't know why but it sort of occurred to me that if a guy can lead you on and make you believe that you're the most beautiful person in the universe just to get you to bed and treat you like shit afterwards, why not do it to them?  give  them  hell.  for a change. somebody's got to do it.   i'm not saying i represent all the women out there who got dumped after being devirginized 'coz chances are, they wouldn't want to bond with me. i mean, i'm not exactly Mother Teresa. i flirt, remember? surely, there must be a lot of really sweet guys out there who've met people like me and who are cursing those women just the same.  i just don't want to be the victim anymore.  i don't want to get hurt anymore.  and if letting a horny guy's hard member go to waste will do the trick, i'm all for it.  damn, there's so much more to a woman than what's between her legs and if that's all a guy is interested in, then sowee :)
