The Dalai Lama, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, has long been known to speak out on social justice issues ranging from China’s occupation of Tibet to the problems associated with globalisation. Now, His Holiness has lent his voice to the 750 million chickens raised and killed for KFC each year by writing a powerful letter to KFC, asking the company to cancel its plans to expand its growing Chinese operation into his homeland of Tibet.  His Holiness writes in his letter, ‘I have been particularly concerned with the sufferings of chickens for many years. It was the death of a chicken that finally strengthened my resolve to become vegetarian. … These days, when I see a row of plucked chickens hanging in a meat shop it hurts. I find it unacceptable that violence is the basis of some of our food habits. … It is therefore quite natural for me to support those who are currently protesting against the introduction of industrial food practices into Tibet that will perpetuate the suffering of huge numbers of chickens’.

The Dalai Lama wants KFC to stop slicing the beaks off baby birds without pain relief, stop breeding and drugging birds to grow so obese that their legs break and stop scalding millions of chickens to death in slaughterhouses every year.
