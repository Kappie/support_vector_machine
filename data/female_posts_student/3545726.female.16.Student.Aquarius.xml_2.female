My mom saw a ghost once, this happened about 10 years ago. My aunt saw a ghost, well, I'm not sure if it was an actual ghost, but she said it was a monster. the monster was sitting on the bed next to her daughter. She said she was yelling at the "monster" to leave her daughter alone, the next night, the "monster" was gone.
