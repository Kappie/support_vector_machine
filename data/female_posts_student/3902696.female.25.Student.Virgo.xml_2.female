The differences were crazy between you and I  If I had known we’d be married I probably would’ve cried  “A huge future mistake!” I would have roared  But I had no idea what God had in store.    The irony lives as people find out  The match of June and Andre they most likely doubt  But who is to comment on God’s decision  Our togetherness is not ours but God’s holy vision.    So here were are, a family of three  How things have changed, I would never have dreamed  You are so different, than I thought you were in high school  But those were my bad days, my days as a fool.    Now we are married and a year has passed  We’ve had ups and downs, but we will definitely last  I know in my heart, that you are a wonderful man  I want you to feel loved, well at least that’s my plan.    You deserve so much from your wife  I want to give you your needs for the rest of your life  I often feel like God owes you more than me  But I guess He doesn’t make mistakes so I just have to believe    You have so many qualities that are worthy to admire  It doesn’t seem like there’s much you need to acquire  You are very loving, thoughtful and sweet  Those are usually the traits that husbands don’t meet.    You always tell me that I’m so beautiful  You’ve helped my confidence where my father was pitiful  It’s weird to be loved so much by you  That at times it’s hard to trust it because it’s too good to be true.    Many people long to be loved strongly as you love me  But their awful fate is to remain empty  But for some reason God decided to bless me  With that smiling Andre that I knew in the 90’s.    I hope your birthday hasn’t been disappointing  I didn’t know what to get you, so I just sat and wrote something  This poem is what came out and I hope it has been pleasant  It’s the best I could do for your birthday present.
