On their way to Luggage Claim Dopey asked the Pope: "Your Excellency, are there any midget nuns in the Vatican?"  The Pope says" Nope."  This disturbs Dopey.  "Your Highness" says Dopey, "Are there any midget nuns in Italy?"  "Im afraid not." says the Pope.  Again this disturbs Dopey  "Okay, are there any midget nuns in the world?" asks Dopey  "Afraid not" sighs the Pope.  Suddenly in the back of the pack the other six dwarfs were laughing out loud.  "What is so funny?" says the Pope? One of the dwarfs replies, "Dopey fucked a penguin, Dopey fucked a penguin."  ~Net
