I walked into a pub I was told was hiring and asked if they had open positions.  I told the manager that I had a bit of experience and was asked to sit down and wait for an on the spot interview.  Sheesh talk about easy.  And the best part is that I start Friday night!  She said that these next couple weeks I would only be working a few nights but as my time there increased and I provided good customer service I would get more hours and hours I wanted.  WAHOO!!!  Needless to say I am a happy camper.  I will be working full time this summer to help make some money for next year.  And because I will be working weekends and night mostly I will have less time to go out and spend all my money.  So it wall works out well.
