Last night I had a dream, that I went to the National Honors Society induction ceremony, and I sat in my seat, while everyone else was called up to be inducted, and they never called me up.  Obviously I have esp, because after I woke up this morning, my mom told me that I didn't make it.  I probably would have, except I have no musical talent whatsoever, and so I missed out on half of the points alloted to the people who are musically talented.  The get an entire point for each ensemble thing they do, and I go three points for everything I'm in.  Unfair? I think so.     I'm just so sick of being seen as untalented in this stupid town.  The only things that matter in their eyes are music and sports.  Sighting my lack of talent in either area, I'm painfully average.   I really need to get out of this town, it's not good for me.
