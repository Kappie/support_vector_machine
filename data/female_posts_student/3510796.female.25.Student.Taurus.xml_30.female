This song rocks!  I put it on the day I got it and Sophia had her  urlLink funky glasses  on and just started dancing like crazy.  Like those girls you see on the lawn at live shows.  Where the music just kicks ass and you cant do anything but move your body.  I didn't even tell her to dance, she just did it.  That's how I know she has it. She has the rhythm.  She knows where I'm going tomorrow, and she isn't happy.  She wants to go so bad, its unreal.  4 years old!  I plan on taking her next summer.  Sophia will only be 5 next summer, but if dmb would break up before she would get a chance, I would feel bad that she didn't get a chance to experience something like that.  At 5 I think she'll remember forever.  My plan is to take her one night and take Mo on a different night.  Should be a great summer.  Ugh, am I already thinking about next summer?    This morning I got a lot of hairs cut.  It was insane.  All that red hair all over the floor.  Feels much better, much cooler and, like I said it will all grow back soon enough.    I will go to class tonight and take a quiz, like every Thursday.  Except I am resorting back to the  'No Pants Thursday'  rule.  How can I make that ole' boy notice me?! HA!  Then I guess I should go to the store and pick up some stuff for the tailgating thang tomorrow evening.  Which reminds me- 1 more day!  The wait is unbearable.  There will be a review up sometime before I leave tomorrow on the show from tonight in MO.  Till then, I gots to bounce.
