When the person no longer knows whom he hates, he is much harder to help."  This quote brings up two totally different thought processes in my mind.  The first is of my grandfather, and how when he was first diagnosed I was truly angry and that anger could be channeled and funneled from me; now that anger has mellowed into resentment, something I cannot pinpoint and remove, so instead I carry it with me making it harder to deal with.  The other track my mind took was along the path of a conversation Erica and I had last night.  The gist of it was that when I am actually made aware of something it tends to be resolved.  My blog a week ago was filled with melancholy entries and I did not even notice that it had changed from its normal state until Erica mentioned it.  Then realizing that I had been melancholy my mind seemingly changed itself and that became reflected into my writing.  No, I did not begin to self edit my blog because of the conversation, my mind began to self edit and realize that my mood was negative and then I could work to truly change my mood.  Another example of this is my "mood," before I knew the cause it was like the resentment of the caged man, always present and non-specific, but as soon as I admitted to myself what it was I could identify it and move on past it.    Specific anger actually helps me yet the tendency seems to dilute things.  It always seems as if it is better to say that you resent something than that you hate a specific thing about it, but resentment just seems to build.  I think that people need to get over their fear of using strong words, as long as they use them for specific things and not for sweeping generalizations.
