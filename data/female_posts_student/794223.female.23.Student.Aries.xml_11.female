Let me give you a clue: I saw him in person December of last year, on that forbidden island 90 miles to the south of us...  When Jessica's roommate mentioned that she wanted to be Napoleon for Halloween, I thought, "'Hey--why don't I be Fidel?!  I reserve the write to do that, b/c I lived in Cuba for a semester." ;-)  I'm all too excited.  Tomorrow I'm going on a hunt for a solid olive-green army suit, and a beard.  Gotta have the beard.  ::strokes chin::  I was thinking--wouldn't it be hilarious if I also got out one of my real Cuban cigars?  How fantastic would that be.  I just watched the Democratic debate, and as usual, I have no idea who I'm voting for in the primaries.  Not that it matters, really.  As long as a democrat wins in '04 and Bush gets kicked out, I couldn't care less which one it is.  I'm gonna go try and get some work done.  Bleh...I'm so tired of studying!  Thank God it'll be over for awhile in December...
