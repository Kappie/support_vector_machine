I would probably mess something up somewhere and it would sound like I was a complete idiot. He looks so interesting.. I mean, I know that sounds weird. But I like the way he "acts" and the way he's cool with the kids on the team he practices with.    *sigh, again*  I am really getting sick of being so shy. Once I know people I'm great, but when it comes to introductions and first time speakings... I choke, completely. I wanna go cry somewhere... erg. Since I lost my voice tonight- I tryed to make eye contact instead. I could never tell if he was looking at me, and I seriously doubt that he was. *sigh* Since eye contact obviously wasn't working out well, I resorted to writing a poem about him. Annnnnnnnd that was not working at all... *Why, O why, Am I so pathetic??* AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.   Now that I haven't gotten that out of my system  He looked really nice today. So I finally decided to jot down his character stats so I could use him as a character in a short story. I took the care not to be discreet... so I think he had some sorta idea that I was writing something about me. I hope it didn't make him mad. That would suck that someone I don't even know hates me already.    To Mystery Guy  I highly doubt that you would ever come across this blog entry, but in the unlikely case that you do- I just wanna say that I'm not stalking you *cough* and that I would really like to talk with you sometime.   In conclusion  I'm sad- I'm gonna go write some poems.     These Times Will Try Me
