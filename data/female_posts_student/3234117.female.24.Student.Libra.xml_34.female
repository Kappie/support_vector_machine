I'm very much culturally ego-centric. As my friends said, I must not have paid much attention in my 9th grade geography class. But you know, I don't think I even took geography. I took it in 4th grade I know. But I doubt I did too well. On a question asking how big the Nile River was, Iwrote "big". The preceding question asked about the size of another, smaller river and I wrote, "not so big". Obviously I doubt these were the answers my teacher was looking for.  In 1st grade my teacher was trying to teach the class about money and counting it. I, however, did not want any part in this. I told my teacher that I didn't want to count money. That my mom didn't use money, she used her credit card. Needless to say, a teacher-parent conference was scheduled. I still apparantly don't know how to count money as I spend way more than I have.   I don't really think I made a good impression with my friend's friend tonight. With the money, the geography, and the sharks. Yes, the sharks. She was telling me her stories of diving and I told her she was crazy and asked her if she saw any sharks? I told her and was adamant in doing so that sharks do eat people! And that I'd probably pass out and drown of fear if I ever dove. But I did try snorkerling once in 100 ft of water. I was very proud of myself. I didn't last long as the flippers started to hurt so my boyfriend had to swim and carry me back to the boat in 100 ft of water. Luckily we didn't drown. I also swam with stingrays in Grand Caymans. Don't ever do it. I went last summer and I literally cried I was so scared. My mom had to hold my sister and I and swim us back to the boat while my dad was laughing and feeding the stingrays right by us. It was, without a doubt, one of the scariest things I have ever done in my life.
