Instead Hannah and I walked through looking at the stones wondering what stories had been buried there.  there were grave of children buried beside their parents, others of soldiers who came back from war in a box.  And all Mrs. Nelson wanted us to do was put a little hash mark in a box if their life coincided with a year.    Its really depressing to look upon these graves just abandoned with no one left to care for them.  The stone have outlast the legacy left in the people.  Stones covered in moss, buried in lichen.  And yet while i am upset that someone left them to slowly weather away I also know that when G-d forbid something happens to my Opa and my Grandma there will be nobody there to keep up their stones.  We are 12 hours away and you can't expect my grandmother's nieces or nephews to, they can't even keep their own lives straight.  Eventually we will all fall into decay, all be forgotten.  And although this is depressing there is a semi silver lining.  It means that with every story that is forgotten, every stupid thing you do will be erased too.  Realistically a stupid move made now won't matter in 20 years or probably even in 1 year.  As Mr. felder put it: if you don't look back on yourself a few years down the road and say "that was really stupid" you aren't taking enough risks.  Right now i can say with certainty I am not taking enough risks.  I think that'll be this year's resolution, take more risks!
