And by the time I check those messages, they're signed off. WTF! Yesterday, Bob wanted to get some people together and go to the movies. I have been wanting to do that for SOO long! But because my away was up, I didnt get the message, and he signed off. That fucking sucks. Then, what happens, is if I dont put up my away message, then no one will message me and I am stuck browsing the net untill I have seen everything. And people told me that it was impossible! Umph! I watched a movie yesterday. Called "The St. Francisville Experiment." It was actually really kinda cool, untill the last 10 mins. when things got totally unbelieveable. Like a ghost cutting this fucking annoying psychic up, and she just stood there like a moron, screaming, covered in blood. Or, Tim. My, my, my. I was disapointed in Tim. He was so awesome, and became my favorite, and he had the cheesiest ending. The Blair Witch kind of thing. Ryan (a girl) was really lame too. She was the most terrifyed, and also had one of the cheesiest endings. Her table started shaking, and she fell thru the floor. They all ended up in some tourcher chamber that was secretly hidden thru a closet in the house. (tim found it first) They did have some good aspects, like the chair, (hey kids, that one worked.) And the little things. But WTF! Havent you ever seen a scurry movie before!?! Alright. I get frustrated when filmaking goes wry.  Well, today Aunt Kathy and I are going to go see 'The Return of the King.' Were gonna go to the 4:00 showing. So, we problably wont get back until 8 or so. Yayy! Then I have school tomarrow. I dont wanna go!! I do, so I can get out of the house, but I dont because I dont want to have to but up with all the hysterics that are going to becoming from everyone. Oh, and I am going to re-dye my hair tonight. The red is really fading, so I got a new bottle last night. wOOt! Ok. Im out like a light. Write later. Promise.
