I can't stand that! I know that we all have our bad days but it seems like some people live two separate lives. Like they have two personalities and each personality lives half of the life. One is the mean life and one is the happy life. I think that somedays I'm Sarah and then other days I'm Regis. Regis is my evil twin, I could explain to you how her name became Regis but I'm just going to let you wonder. But today I'm Sarah but I'm guessing tomorrow I'll be Regis cuz I have summer school :( Oh and I got a cat today, her name is Phantom. She's very smart and very pretty.
