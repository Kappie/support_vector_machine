We cried for thirty minutes straight. Haha. What dorks. I have yet to watch it.   Finch is awesome.  It's a beautiful day. Yet, I feel misplaced. I think too much about things that shouldn't be thought about.     "Here I am beside myself again I’m torn apart by words that you said All in all, I know we’re falling apart Where did you run to so far away And here we are to sing you a song And there you are asleep against the windowpane Just like always You said you like to hear the rain sometimes All I can do is tell you the truth Oh my eyes will the tell you the same Here we are to sing you a song And there you are asleep again Grasping our hands together, we feel we are one result"-Finch, "Ender"
