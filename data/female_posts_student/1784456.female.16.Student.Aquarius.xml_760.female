Then I just get rid of it and plot my revenge instead! :D Mmm, every one gets different kinds of angry! I figured out their and there, or Susie did...

I will shut up one of these days trust me! Hey we have to go to the disco and take the piss out of them cause that's what they're doing to us and we can do it to them! I remain the right to be pissed off... hmm, have to tell them that!
