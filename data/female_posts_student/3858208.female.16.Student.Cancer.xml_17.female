I want to, even though I know how easily it could become a huge problem. I just want to do it to see my blood, to prove to myself that I'm still alive even though I don't  feel  alive.    I had a long talk with Brooke last night. She asked me some questions about what it's like to be depressed ( urlLink click here  - this is a poem I wrote that I feel sums it up best), which I really appreciated because nobody ever actually wants to know what I'm going through. They all say "I know how you feel," but unless they've been depressed how can they? So at least Brooke made the effort to understand at least somewhat how I'm feeling at my lowest points.     RIGHT NOW     mood ::  hopeless   listening to/watching ::  nothing   eating/drinking ::  vanilla coke   craving ::  happiness   talking to ::  nobody   thinking about ::  my driving test tomorrow   wishing ::  that my dog would grow the fukk up   wearing ::  jeans and a red t-shirt   random ::  This is my little secret.
