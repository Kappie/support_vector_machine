Its been a week since i last posted and to be honest, nothings happened.And by that i mean nothing exciting.     I did however manage to speak to my two bitches on MSN the other day which was quite marvy.     Ones in Spain (where rain falls mainly on the plain) and the other is in Frog-a-go-go-land.     They are coming back soon which will be a guten thing....even if it is after my birthday.        Another dear fwendie of mine has also gone away now....to merry old Newquay (or Newquey?).     So as i have wished both my bitches farewell, it seems only fair that i wish 'Peewee' (whos name isnt really that, but nicknamed that in order of our code...which is breakable...and also abit pointless when people know who your talking about).     So to you dearie...Au Revoir (thats french by the way) and have a guten time!     (p.s i did say i would mention you again..mwhaha!lmmao)        Only TWO days till my birthday now .* yay*.I was about to say that i wont be the baby anymore as it seems that im the only one who hasnt turned 15 yet....but then most people will be turning 16 and it makes me the ickle younger one again.     It really is annoying that 'twin of Fin' Roisin isnt at school on her birthday .    We had great plans for assembly.........        I hate the weather.Yesterday it was boiling hot and probably about 30C, and today its rainy gloomy, with a slight hint of muggy-ness.     I think its about time i stopped moaning now.        Tune in again for another helping of 'moi's' lovely blogg.     So for now     Goodbyb          [edit] crap, im gonna have to pay full price at the Odeon now.Dam you!You win this time!          urlLink     Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
