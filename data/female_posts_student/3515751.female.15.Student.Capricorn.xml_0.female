Till now, God never really revealed Himself to me but I learned something else. It should be in the later part of this blog. This morning, I woke up and I actually dreaded to go to school although I wasn’t sleepy and I was kinda awake but in any ways, I still go to school. I was kinda worried in school coz something is going to get wrong somehow…on Wednesday night, I told “her” that I want to talk to her and we set appointment. Then I started to dream that very night I asked her. I dreamt that we were enemies and we didn’t talk to each other at all. We hated each other a lot. And when I awoke, I was like I hope that won’t happen or not I’m going to be dead. Then, today I went and talk to her lar.at fist I dunno where she disappear. She’s just no where. Not sure. The after that I felt so thirsty and thought that I should go get water and then I band into Grace and she say Serena wants to see me. So went and find for Serena forgetting bout my hungry stomach and my thirsty mouth. And then when I met her she was like: are you free now? And I said I don’t think so. She was like: Oh then never mind. Just want to ask whether you want to do the newsletter. You want?....okay…at that moment ar…I also dunno what to say coz I really want to do but I scared I can’t handle so many things. But ended up I say okaylar coz I don’t think it will be hard lar…some how I will find the time wan. Oh yar…then in the morning right, Su Yi told me I’m in the worship team. At that moment I was like wanna scream already…I was really happy and excited lar…I was really desperate lar…it’s three years already I applied to be a vocalist…so I was overjoyed lar. Okay. I think I should continue. So I finish talking to Serena and then “she” appeared. I was like…there you are. I walked her to block G to put her bag first. But on the way, she asked me what I wanted to tell her. I told her that she’s know later. Then she start guessing lar and then she say ‘is it about me?’…then I was like ‘erm…something like that lar’…I think that’s what I say…it’s somewhere there lar. and then she so suddenly say ‘then I don’t want to talk about it’. I was so so hurt at that moment. I didn’t know what to do. I just got kinda stunt at that moment but I’m still walking and talking lar…I was kinda disappointed coz I put aside all my cowardliness and took up all my guts to talk to her. I have a problem in talking to people face to face especially when it’s some kind of problem. I was very disappointed and I didn’t know what to do. I tried to make as if nothing is wrong and it’s okay…I went up the stairs towards the canteen lar. When I was about to go up the stairs, “she” called me lar but I turn behind and she didn’t look as if she just called me. But then she so suddenly she appear next to me lar. And then she ate her fries while talking to me lar. we went into one of the classes in block E…and we started talking. It wasn’t what I expected lar…I couldn’t really talk to her. My heart was beating so fast…and one scary thing…she say ‘look at me!’…I was like…arrrrrr….she look so scary. Very scary indeed. Staring at someone is not nice. Then we started the conversation. I have to keep quiet for like a few minutes coz my heart feels like coming out and I feel like leaving the place. While talking to her, it seems like I dunno what to say. My words are all gone. My heart wasn’t there. It pumped out of me already. It’s so hard for me to get all the words out. Then I told her bout everything…not exactly everything coz I totally forget what I want to tell her and what I want to ask her. Just staring at her makes me want to run away already. And then after that she asked me a few things…actually a lot of things….and she told me a lot of things also. ‘I realized that I’m not the first one you have this problem with. And I don’t think I’m wrong and there’s nothing wrong with me. I treat everyone the same. You just have to know. You should sit down and ask yourself what you want and how you really feel. You know, I don’t feel hurt or angry. But I feel sad for you.’ I was kinda quiet. Thinking about what she was saying. And I told her that I know it’s because of me but then I really can’t understand myself and I dunno how to look within myself. I really don’t know and I think that’s why I can’t really get along with people. And she actually went through a lot. She went through all this before. And then I start to try to change topic. I don’t want to continue like that coz we kept quiet for some time. I was thinking a lot and she just stare at me. So I told her about everything in my heart. My family, my friends and my walk with God and most of the things I am going through, she went through before. She told me a lot of things which really encourages me. And God really spoke through her to me. Faith is not feeling or something you can see but something you believe although you can’t see or feel it. And I should be very grateful coz I’ve known God at this age. I thought of everything she said. No family is perfect. Everything we’re gong through helps to build up my faith. I don’t know how’s it going to help me yet but I’ll wait and see.  And today, manda came for CF. I miss her a lot…she seems taller I think. And then the speaker, pastor melcam…I think…can’t remember his name and dunno how to spell. Anyways, he really spoke to me especially near the end…keeping the fire burning and how to get caught in the fire. And that I should stand firm, do my quiet time and trust in Him. Maybe slowly I’ll see the difference. Everyone is experiencing different things and yarlor.  In any ways, I’m seriously very happy now coz I can sing….heehe…and I got a chance to serve God…I got to do the newsletter...i’m actually very desperate although I might have to make my whole schedule even more pack…but I really want to serve God…He’s so big and even as I face a giant I’ll still look at the giant like it’s so small coz I have an even BIGGER GOD!!!! AMEN!…ohyar…I hope I will remember to bring an empty cd for Serena on Monday. Have to get rid of the forgetful me. okaylar…I think this should be all for now…hope to blog again soon…my exams are so near already. I’ve like exactly 100 more days to study only. Hopefully by God’s grace, I can get really results. My parents are kinda pressuring me now. Okaylar…got to go…bye!! Love, Jovy.
