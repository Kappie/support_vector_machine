It's been a very long time...)  based on the popular factoid book of the 60's.  Best scenes: Tony Randall as a sperm, and Gene Wilder as a lover of sheep.  I went to a Hallowe'en party once, dressed as his character (after the fall) - a bum with a bottle of Woolite.  checked out Ching's  urlLink new site  - really nice.  WTG, Ching!  I hope, someday, I'm artistic and web-literate enough to do that.
