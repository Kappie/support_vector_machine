Yesterday in the midst of all of the mayham Jesse called me at the apartment. I felt so stressed I was about to cry. I was hopeing for some words of encouragment and all I got was a "calm down honey" that's it! what happened to the guy I fell in love with who knew exactly what to say to me when I was too stressed to think for myself? One of my fears feels like it is comming true. He has changed. I miss talking to him so much, sure I have had plenty of opportunities to talk to him on the phone but not how I wanted our conversations to go. I wish he could ask me how I was doing for once. I know he must be so busy, butI wonder if he know what I am going through back here without him? I feel so lost and helpless. I just wish he was home and this nightmare was over with. My family has been great to me, My mom and brother and sister have all been there 100%. mY Ssister and I finished the last of the cleaning of the aparetment today and I am turning my keys into our landloard on wednesday after I get off of work. The terror of not having a military ID has come and gone and throught some creative thinking all that felt lost was slowly but surly redeemed. Now on to bigger things. Tomorrow My mom and I are going out to McClallin to try to get someone to help me make heads or tails out tof the Tricare forms (Health Insurence) then before you know it I will be fully covered for all health care by the military for the duration of Jesse's leave. This will be good. I hope everything will go fine. I am going to wrap this one up for the night, even though it is only about a quarter after 9 pm I am a little tired still from all of the stress and hard labor of the past week. I hope to get on again soon, still working on getting my computer up and running, and used to not having cable internet anymore (Back to dial up for me). Thanks for listening to my whining,.
