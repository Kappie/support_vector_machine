(It's hailing teeny tiny pieces of ice outside and it's sunshiny as all get out.)   2.  True  sexuality lies at the hands of   urlLink Victoria's Secret . They have these low-rise briefs and thongs that I love. Don't know whether I'm brave enough to try the low-rise extreme t-string yet.)  I'll have to put that on my summer to-do list.   and opting for an  honorable mention : 3. I will never understand men. (I always knew this, but just recently I realized that I don't   get   twenty-something guys. they are just beyond me.  What's my favorite part of a guy?   Any of them, I love looking at them and they way they move.   But I figure that's ok since half the men I know can't understand woman, namely, me. Ha, I'm sooo mysterious. I wish, too bad I wear my heart on my sleeve. Oh gosh! Did I give away too much? I don't know. I don't think anyone really reads my blog besides me.
