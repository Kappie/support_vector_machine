Work was actually pretty decent and i decided that i like the baby park the best because i can chill with lil girls who are actually close to my age haha. I'm not really in the mood to run today.. but i have to so ill do that at like 6 maybe.   Tonight I want to go to the picnic but i didn't talk to anyone really about it. I was planning on meeting Mandie and Heather up there but I was gonna see if carissa or someone would come with me earlier. Hopefully ill be able to figure something out...write more when i do.
