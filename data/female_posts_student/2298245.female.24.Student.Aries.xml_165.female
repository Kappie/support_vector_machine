Going to see The Passion tonight, so will probably have something to say about it - though nothing very profound, I'm sure - tomorrow at some point.  I think that it will be an experience, to say the least.    Tomorrow is the Journal of Legal Commentary symposium.  Topic: Immigration Law.  Some of the stuff should be interesting, but because my attendance is compulsory, I am of course not looking forward to it.  It's like when there were books you were supposed to read for class.  It made it that much harder to do because you were forced, when it might have been something you would have otherwise enjoyed reading if you had decided to do so on your own.   But maybe that's just me...
