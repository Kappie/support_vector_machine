I watched what ever I wanted without apologising, and I realized that I really like my own company for the most part. After too long, I get freaked out, but the occasional evening alone is nice to get my bearings and just think my own thoughts. Oh well. I'm going to bed now, and I'll get up early to type out the assignments for the seminar tomorrow.
