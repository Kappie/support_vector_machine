Maybe some people enjoy reading novels that involve obstacles being overcome and the power of true love.  I'm getting out of that phase; I need to clean the warm fuzzies out of my brain.  I'm starting on Dalton Trumbo's " urlLink Johnny Got His Gun " this afternoon.  I've had it for years but for some reason, last night, I finally decided to read it.  Everyone either wants me to dress sexy or sporty for this evening's sporting event/meet the friends escapade.  I don't have the wardrobe for either of those options.  Now I'm getting nervous.
