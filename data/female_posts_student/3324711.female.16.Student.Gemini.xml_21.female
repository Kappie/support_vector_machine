Why Wont they let us be ourselves With our potential we could toe the line And show the bastards up with our divine  Light   Ok so I just cleaned my room and learned a new song on guitar. What a night. I think its past my bedtime.   The Adventures of Morgan, Lauren, and the HPB  --- Coming Soon to a theatre near you.  Lauren I think we are too strange for words.  2 days until my birthday! And I havent even seriously started planning my birthday. This is terrible. Lydia, we need to get on this right away. But it will probably have to be apres les examens. which blows. but meh.   Seize All the records from the past Hold ransom all the artifacts This ragged town protects them to the last With lies   Im expecting presents from all of you.. except you Behn, your off the hook. :)
