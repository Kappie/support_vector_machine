Its creeping me out and AHH   you . are ruining my good day and how are  you  always there? your always there and you never stop complaining or bitching about something and blaming me and I made an effort and now Im done, finished. I have nothing else to say to you. Im having a great time and Im happier than Ive ever been, and I dont want to deal with your issues anymore.   Now Im done and back to my wonderful day! The sky is blue the sun is shining, Behn is calling tonight :D and hopefully pretty early so that I can go kayaking! But if not than whatever.  And Radioland people suck because they wouldnt give me that poster.
