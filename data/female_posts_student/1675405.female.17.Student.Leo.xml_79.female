So how about a cute  platinum blonde  pixie cut with  hot pink?  Any objections? :-D  Marie and I went over to John's house earlier, and what I saw really made me smile. You have Marie, who is completely head over heels for one boy ("one special boy... one boy to walk with, one boy to talk with, one boy... that's the way it should be..eeeeeee" lol). And as cute as the notion of her adoring him so is, it was even more adorable to see the feeling returned. They are both tickled pink over each other. It's so nice to finally see Marie floating in sheer ecstasy; for her to be completely oblivious to all else but her feelings for one person. It's so raw, so pure, and so untainted, and so rare! She's truly a gem.   I'm liking these comments you all are leaving me. They make me smile. For those of you who have, keep it up; for those of you who have not, by all means do!
