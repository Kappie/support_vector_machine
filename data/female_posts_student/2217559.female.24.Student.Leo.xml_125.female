Low and behold - we have a serial killer!! Yikes. Well, the police aren't calling it that yet but damn it definitely sounds like we have a freak on our hands. People are so whack, I swear. Anyway, I had to call Jennifer and talk to her on the phone so I didn't get scared (how pathetic right?) I just had this errie feeling about the whole article, I don't know. Weird. Well, and the location of the body found today is only about 2 miles north of my house (which is even scarier?!!?!?).  Hmm, maybe the serial killer won't want me since I am not in my mid-30s. That seems to be what's he/she's looking for.  Okay, Jennifer is going to seriously laugh at me but what the hell - an interesting link for today comes to you from her - she told me about this crazy scary documentary she watched about the director of the latest "Village of blah blah blah".  Anyway, check it out.... http://www.scifi.com/mnight/main.html  Hmm, nothing else really - except tomorrow is THE TEST.  I have studied all afternoon and I think I can safely say my eyes are now completely crossed. I know I could study more but I am afraid that I am just confusing myself with too much information.  I think I will quit for now and review again before falling asleep.  Maybe even get up earlier in the morning to flash through my cards one more time. Damn, I am just so paranoid about this frekaing test. How pathetic (once again.)  Ok loves, I am off for now. Take care. Sweet dreams!  Shelly
