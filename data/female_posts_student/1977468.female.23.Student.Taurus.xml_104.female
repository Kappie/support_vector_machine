It's kind of like sharing a room. We did that a few times. And he never threw objects at me in the middle of the night for snoring (cough*CHRYSTAL*cough). The only problem this might pose at first is that you might mistake me for him. Now let me get this straight. I know how to spell. I'm an obsessively good spellr. If there are grammatical errors, wrong punctuation narks or misspellings, then you know I'm not writing. Here's something else. I like boys, and he likes girls. This should tip you off. I have a feeling matters of the opposite sex are going to come up frequently, so take note. Lastly, I am four years older and female, so my topics are  always  going to be of a more mature nature.  Good. I'm glad we cleared things up. Signing off.
