I love all of his writing...it's great. At least I think so. The rest of you are just crazy.  Anyways...I'm still pretty insanely bored. I guess I should be reading for english, but, ya know what? I don't feel like it. I'll finish up the first section of that crazy book before I go to bed tonight.  Well, I'm outta here...au revoir!
