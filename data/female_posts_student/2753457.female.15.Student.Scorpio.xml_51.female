I'm having a lot of fun at TAP this year.  I was so tired of being bored.  It is a really funny and fun show, and this year I got the biggest part I've had so far.  I'm still not quite sure whether I want to invite a bunch of people from school to the show.  I kind of like to separate this kind of experience from that.  But, who knows?  Maybe my mind will change.  Maybe some of the people from past years will come to the show and I'll get to see them.  That would be fun.  I know Caroline and Allison are.  We'll see who else comes. Well, I don't have anything else to say.  I think I'll go find something better to do.  I've gotta get to bed early tonight.
