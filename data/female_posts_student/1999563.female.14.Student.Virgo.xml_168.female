If there is even one mistake, one little error, I feel like I am a bad person.  I make my whole self bad.    I am quite confusing. Well, I don't have any school today. I am "sick" so I am going to see if I can get out of rowing for today. This is my last week of rowing. Yippee!  I have to do soooo much school work. Yuck! Then I am going to church. Yippeee!  That is all.  Love, Laura
