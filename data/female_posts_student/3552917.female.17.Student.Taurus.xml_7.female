But like it may just be b/c I haven't seen him in like hmmm like 8 years.. ya think?? Well my summer has been kinda weird...there really hasn't been much of one... I work like a lot really.. But hey I'm gettin a good bit of money..So I really cant say much... I went swimming like 2 times.. I got a tan line..hehe. I am going to Florida at the end of July.. I believe it is the last week.. I am going with Amber.. I am excited!! I talked to Brandy today.. It was weird b/c I was boutta sign off and she all popped up and was like "towee" so I started talkin.. I think she is what inspired me to start using this thing..lol kinda!! Anywho... I wonder what my friends are doing? **pondering** HMMM.... Jamie is with some little kids she used to watch a lot.. they called her and hung up on here when I was talkin to her it was cute!! lol..
