Mellow, sleepy day at school (after writing a crazy paper in the morning) followed by some TV watching and general time-wasting at home. Liz came over to get announcements going, then Dave and Melissa came over and we all went to Woodstocks. Despite some general awkwardness, I had a reasonably good time, then Liz and I talked about deep stuff. I drove her home, then came back, watched weird TV with Lisa, and then took a long needed shower, though I neglected to shave. I think I'm going to go to bed now, since I was up at 5:20am this morning. Oh, my best friend sleep, how I've missed you. I'm sorry that drama queen homework took me away from you all this time. Homework really is a needy, demanding kind of friend, who really isn't a friend to me all that often. Stupid homework. Oops, I hope she doesn't read my blog. She'd be pissed, but I'm totally blowing her off when I graduate. Really, sleep, I promise, I won't neglect you any more.
