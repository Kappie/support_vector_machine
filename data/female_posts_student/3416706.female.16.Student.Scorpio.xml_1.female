All of my posts will reflect that. 2. I am an anti-feminist, and probably most of my posts will reflect this (usually anger directed toward pro-death (pro-abortion) and pro-"gay marriage" advocates). 3. I like to rant. So if you get frustrated by the length, I am sorry. This is my "steam outlet" so I can be angry and release my stress in a positive way (some days, I just do not feel like playing guitar).  Please, tell me if you disagree with me. But please do not attack my Lord or my life. Thank you!  In His Love,  Sarah
