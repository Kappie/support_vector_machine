We talked about everything from younglife, to new boys in my life, to his new girlfriend. A Part of me does kind of miss him but another part doesn't miss him. I just miss how good of a cuddler he was. He leaves in about 2 weeks for college and I probably won't see him again until christmas break. oh well.   Oh and Athony didn't call. that bastard.
