She is in love with Christiano Ronaldo, a Portugese footballer, and has just sent me a whole bumper bundle of photos of him (my lucky day eh?!) crying like a baby, exposing his thighs, etcetera etcetera. Deeply, deeply disturbing - as you will well know if you have ever seen/ seen/heard an interview with this guy...      Anyway in other pressing news, If You're Not The One, or IYNTO if you are a hardcore fan of the song, remains one of my all time favourites, although I have ended one of many "crushes" as they are apt to be called, due to the fact I can no longer overlook the fact that he is a scary religious fanatic and deeply immature... However, he does write  bloody good  songs. If you like the romantic and varied types. And he is very good live, I'm seeing him for the third time soon...     Anyway.  I need pizza. Now. Starving. Miles has eaten everything else in the house...        Our revels now are ended. These our actors.      As I foretold you, were all spirits and     Are melted into air, into thin air:     And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,     The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,     The solemn temples, the great globe itself,     Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve     And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,     Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff     As dreams are made on, and our little life     Is rounded with a sleep.    William Shakespeare       Incredibly depressing but poignant I think.          Hm.          Concerts concerts concerts galore am most happy!!! Maroon5, Scissor Sisters AND Daniel, YAYAYAYAYAAY! (Explicable happiness today folks!) So goooood i loooooove concerts.....          god have the mother of headaches.          Daniel's new album's out soon .          FOOD. NEED. FOOD. AM JUST RAMBLING HERE ...          o pizza's ready tara!
