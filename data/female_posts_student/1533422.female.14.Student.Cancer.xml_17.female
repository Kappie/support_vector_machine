I hardly did ANYTHING on my website, but who cares? We've got our reports anyhoo and my I.C.T. one was quite good.  I couldn't read Dr. Nuttall's comment at the end of it.  It said something about "fully justified" and "one of the top students in the year group".   Mr. Dougall's was worse, but the 98% at the top said it all.  Ah.  I am sooo bored.  I'd probs rather do work than just mess around.  Clare and Loz and Tom are doing something over in the corner, with the computer turned right the other way.  Something tells me I maaaay not be included in that.  La la li la.  I can't be bothered to do anything.  All my posts seem to be rambly and random now, but everything's like that at the end of term.  Lessons have no point cuz no one's doing anything.  My brain has started to atrophy.  I shall go now, as I am getting paranoid about people reading over my shoulder (and people who can't have the address of this blog finding it :S)  Syanara, *~Jools~*
