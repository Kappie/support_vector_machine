He went as far as to have a sexual relationship with my husbands ex wife.Eddie is constantly telling my hubby that he needs to go back to his "real family and quit playing house" with me. In the 5 years that my husband I have been together Eddie and I have had one civil conversation, not that we have un civil conversations we just don't talk to each other. I am very aware of how he feels about me and I am not going to kiss his butt and he knows how I feel about him. When my hubby found out he was being deployed my wonderful sister in law decided to tell him instead of letting my hubby do it. Eddie comes over acting all concerned and dishearten that his oldest sonis being sent off into a combat zone.So dishearten he scheduled a trail ride for the time when hubby was leaving. He is one of those types of people who uses and uses and uses but then wonders why no one wants to talkhim. Whenhubby left he told me to not give out his address to his family, he has their addresses and willwrite them when he feels he is ready. Irespect that totally.  Today Eddie has called 4 times and even came by and rang the door bell for 10 minutes. I know it is chicken to avoid him like this but I don't have any patience to listen to him and his sob story about why his kids don't like him. It would end with me telling him togrow up. If he wants to be family then he should have been trying for the last 5 years. I have a great relationship with my mother in law, Eileen. I have nothing to say tothe rest of themembers ofmy husbands family.  I have to say I find it so pathetic that they are now concerned about how he is doing and how much danger he is in. When he had surgery where were they? When his daughter was born where were they? They only want to come around when they feel that they will benefit from the attention. I know that my sister in law tells everyone that her brother is in Afghanistan and oh...Whoa is me....blah blah.  Family should be family no matter what....
