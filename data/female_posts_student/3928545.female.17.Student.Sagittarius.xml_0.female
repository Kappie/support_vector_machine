"So Taylor, do you think if you don't make out with anyone for a lot longer, you're going to forget?" ( I made some subtle changes to make it more funny because I'm probably the only person in the world who'll think it's funny) -Sarah  "Um....I don't know, I don't think so. I think it's kind of like riding a bike" -Taylor  (me)     What do you think?
