You have this whole speech/monologue prepared, you walk to center stage, you look out into the blinding lights and you stall. Figures.  I guess I could start with telling you a little about me. My name is Jessie. I'm 23, a scorpio and I think Jessica Simpson is hilarious. I also blast Britney Spears in my truck, have an addiction to Diet Coke, and wouldn't trade my flip-flops for Monolos, even if you paid me. Ok... maybe  if you paid me.   Well I guess that's a good enough start. I promise to try and make all future posts much more interesting!
