Actually, this week wasn't that amazing or anything like that. Just you're average week.  Truth be told, I'm not ready for school to be out. It's not that I enjoy my classes that much, it's that I don't want to go without seeing my friends for 2 months. I mean, I won't be seeing all the friends that I ONLY see at school, and I won't be seeing April or Chelsea AFTER school. They're both going away to camp for the whole summer. But hey, good for them.  The other reason I dun wanna be out of school is because of Nick. My luck, we won't see each other much over the summer. Though, if I had it my way, we'd see each other almost every day. lol, but I have a feeling that this won't be happening. The best we'd probly get would be once a week (?) Course, I'm pretty sure his parents probly wouldn't like we hanging out with him too much. Ah well. We'll work something out.  Thursday I played tennis with Chelsea, Nick, and Charlie. Jacob was going to play, but he didn't. He got there, then didn't play. I was almost offended. There were alotta annoying kids there, so we didn't stay TOO long. lol.  I also had a band concert Thursday. It went pretty good, if I do say so myself. Well, I have family over at the moment, (oh joy....) so this blog is going to stay fairly short.  Love, Shannon "God gave us relatives, so thank God that we get to choose our friends."--(forgot who said it)
