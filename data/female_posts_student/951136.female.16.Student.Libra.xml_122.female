I did it for that feeling. the face can change. but that feeling is something to live for. and thats exactly what we did. whether that feeling passed through you tonight- probably didn't b.c. your more grounded. or not. i just smile when i think about it. you know what i'm talking about. so dont roll your eyes at me and say that  I  liked him. like i said-its not about that, who it is, or what he was like. it was the fucking wanting. the sad part is, it's all us. we were just lucky enough to find a face to attach it to. i didn't really see it, but i felt the way i did. the wanting to feel it again is just as bad as feeling it...  so about brad pitt....  sorry-i know you may think me predictable. but thats what i do- think about the past and what we did. - wrong or right. so, kill me. time to study, eh? ....ZZZZzzzzzz
