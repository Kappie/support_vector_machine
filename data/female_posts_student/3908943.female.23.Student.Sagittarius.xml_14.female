I'm ready to go back, and at the same time I know that my days as a second bachelors candidate will be coming to a close in a blink of an eye.  It'll be a bittersweet semester for me, becuase I do know that this is most likely my last semester as a WIU student.  I'm debating whether to go ahead and walk at the graduation or not.   You have to remember, I've already done this once.  I think it had to be one of the proudest moments of my life too.  I had went through a lot to get to that point.  To all those who will graduate this year, a couple of words of advice for you - enjoy your senior year and make the best of it while it lasts, because it goes by quick!  A lot of people I knew thought it would just be like graduating from high school. Believe me, it means so much more to go walk across this stage and get that ($40000) slip of paper this time around than it did in high school.  Usually its not only because of the hard work that people put into studies (or partying), but its also surviving a drama-filled 4 years that sometimes comes with college life.         Today was shopping day.  I decided to go get my school supplies now instead of waiting till I got to Macomb and having to deal with literally thousands of people at the same time.  I love busy shopping seasons (especially Christmas), but not when it comes to school.  I remember when I was little I used to love going back to school.  Then the high school years I hated it.  Now I'm all up for it again.  Strange how things work sometimes isn't it?
