I'm officially a freak now  But wait  these girls,  A few of them  have scars too  My breath catches in my throat  Could they be like me?  I dare to hope  Maybe I could actually talk  Spill my story  These girls could relate  Maybe  I'm not such a freak  Maybe  I'm not so stupid  Maybe  When I get through with  "Group"  He'll love me  Like he used to  When I was better  Maybe  I can tell my story  To these very similar  New friends...
