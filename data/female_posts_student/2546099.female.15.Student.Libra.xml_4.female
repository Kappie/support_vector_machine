U mite be wondering how thats possible, well i dont feel like going in2 much detail but i had a lot of things happen last yr. All the stuff wit josh and then the stuff wit petra and on top of that 2 of my gd friends leaving me 2 go 2 boarding skool. I miss u fiona and lewis. There r sumthings i miss about tenison. I miss knowing all the ppl in ur yr level and alot of da otha ppl. I miss my friends like Sam, Kirby, Tessa, Jim, Ryan, Kris, Em, Sophie and many more. I think im gonna be leaving depression behind, not that i know if i was depressed but it felt like it. i dont really have much 2 write so buh bye ppls.
