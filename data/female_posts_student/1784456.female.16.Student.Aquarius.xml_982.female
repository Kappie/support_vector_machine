I am tired of being happy or sad, Not alowed to just be content, Not allowed to think or relent.  I am tired of keeping everyone happy, Remembering to smile, And brush my teeth.  I am tired of having to say the right thing, Without offending anyome, And making everyone laugh or think.  I am tired of this life I'm in, This short race to the end, Balancing life on the point of a pin.  I am tired, So let me rest, And then I shall continue with this waltz with death.  Katie Sims   Every one say "Happppy happy people holding hands!" More like "Ehe... she's been at the calpol again," But seriously, bit depressing huh? YURP!
