I have to apologize 100x over for being absent from your life for the past two weeks or so. I have been running around like crazy and it's been tough keepingone step ahead of the work. Honestly, I didn't do a very good job at allexplaining to you how I operate and all the things going on in my life. I feellike that was a rather rude thing to do to you.      See, like I told you earlier tonight, I might be 20, but it often feels like Ihave to operate as though I'm 30. Kinda crazy, but it's how i've lived for awhile. I love working, but it takes up a ton of time.      In addition to that, my family comes before anything else. They are so very important to me. Faith, Family,  School come first. And as of late, family has been taking up a lot of time followed by work.      Honestly, I haven't been very accessible to any of my friends of late, not justyou. And the hardest part is that it's almost time to head back to PSU. Summer is indeed winding down. That sucks.      But . . . I have so enjoyed my time with you. And desperately want to spendmore time with you before we head back to school. You are such a doll. So much fun to be around, enthusiastic, funny, and believe it or not, kind and sweet. So let's enjoy the time we have left and make the most of it.       "we'll make the best of what's around" -- dmb      ciao bella donna,   Andy
