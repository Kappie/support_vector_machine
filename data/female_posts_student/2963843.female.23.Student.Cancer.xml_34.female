How the hell is he supposed to know why am I angry if I don't talk about it? I know I tend to shut down when I get hurt or angry.. But that is how I am.. I find it hard to tell him because I know he will shout at me anyway.. I actually went all the way from choa chu kang to hougang just to get to his place.. And he left me alone to play online games! And it seems like tv is more interesting than me... I feel so unappreciated... There is just no more surprises in our relationship anymore.. Its been really long since he had done anything special for me.. Even when I tell him about it, he would say that I'm being unreasonable again...  I was the one who initiated the breakup.. I told him that I don't believe I would not be able to find another guy who treat me better as he does...  Is everything my fault? That I always bottle everything up and cause fustration?  His last sms was he hope I can find another guy who can tolerate me for as long as he does. If there is such a guy around, that is.  How can he hurt me like this? How can he say something like that? I don't believe in love anymore..   Its over, I won't go around in circles anymore! Somebody pinch or trash me if I go back again... I mustn't!
