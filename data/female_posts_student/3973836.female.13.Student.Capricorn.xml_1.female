The appraiser  came today, so all yesterday was stressful. We scrubbed the walls, the floors, vacuumed all the carpets and furniture, bleached litterboxes and the ferret cage, dusted everything, washed like 2-3 loads of dishes, 7-8 loads of laundry, cleaned all the bedrooms, and a whole lot more. I slept like a freakin' rock. It was so exaughsting. Then today the apprasier came (FINALLY). It took him like...2 mins to appraise the house -.- AND THEN we found out that we can go to Kentucky! YAAAY!!! I can't wait! I think the funnest part of the entire trip is the way down there ^_^ I love driving through all the states looking at my surroundings and scribbling interesting things in my journal (Yes, I'm a writing sorta person). I can't wait!! Eeeee! lol ^_^ Gotta run!
