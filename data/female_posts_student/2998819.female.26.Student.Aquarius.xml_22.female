Its as if I haven't ran today or I forgot I already ran. I was driving to lunch and I noticed this guy running down the street and I thought out loud, "hey I need to do my run," then I remembered I already did it. Maybe I will do another 3 later tonight after dinner, considering I have a rest day tomorrow. The problem with running twice in a day is the fact that I don't' have enough running clothes. I don't' mind putting dry, dirty ones on since they will be gross anyway but the sweaty wet ones I do only because whenI amrunning I don't realize how sweaty my clothes get until I get home. I think I just might wait till tomorrow evening to run again. Who knows. I am getting ancy and rambling so I must be going.
