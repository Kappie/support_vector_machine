"Forgive  Forget" I think I've waited long enough Our world was once forget-me-nots  And now I wait another year.  Now I wait another year.  I need you here.  I think I've heard this one before,  But it's not you walking through my door.  And now I wait another year.  Now I wait another year.  I need you here.  I need you here.  I need you here.  I need you here.  Don't bother it now,  Let sleepers lie.  Bygones have all gone by.  Forgot what we fought for,  Hard as I might,  Don't have the will to fight.  Forgive  forget  Whatever was said  Because we're growing up By the hour.  I never would let  It go on like it did:  All good things  Have endings.  Forgive  forget  Whatever was said  All good things  Have endings.  Don't bother it now,  Let sleepers lie.  Bygones have  all gone by.  Forgot what we fought for,  Hard as I might,  Don't have the will to fight.  Don't bother it now,  Let sleepers lie.  Bygones have all gone by.  Forgot what we fought for,  Hard as I might,  Don't have the will to fight.    If these are wrong, F-U...I'm too lazy to type it all out...I just ganked 'em from someone else's website
