But, we haven't seen notre homme in two weeks, it will be three weeks. and then four after the week we go back to school. thats if we go. Thats a long time. especially based on someone unlike orlando bloom where as you Never saw him so it didnt matter. but we base our whole theory  on  seeing him. but what happens when we do see him...what will happen. He himself beats expectations. but where can you go fro three weeks other than higher  w. someone like him, will we disappointed? i NEVer want to be disappointed him a god like him, its just that, the last time we saw him he gave us his number not to mention the usual eye sex. But what if its died on his part. We've built up So much on this "relationship", that we'll get there , and see him he'll walk by say hey, and be gone...and all i could say, is waht did we expect. he'd be on OUR level, and freak and be like HEY! HAVEN"T SEEN YOU IN FOREVER!   i've missed you!....   so talk to me, how've you been!.... i doubt it.  i'm not saying i dont want it. and after all this thinking if that does happen. i'll be disappointed out of my auria. but ssssssssttttttiiiiiiiiiilllllllllllllllllllllllllllll. thinking about jeremy is a consant in my life, and for the past few minutes its been of this, so i got it out, even tho i really had no plot or thesis, OH WELL! HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYONE! sigh...my vacation is over... i ahve to go to baton rouge tomorrow, and that will be far from a worthwhile extravaganza...sigh. and i still haven't read le petit prince for france and done the project. GA...mf bs it tell you.
