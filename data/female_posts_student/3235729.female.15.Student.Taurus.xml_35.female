We were walking to my house, and there was this lady, and she had a dog and a kid, both of which were on leashes. Anywho, this kid kept looking at Autumn, and every time he did he would yell "SAAANDY!" in a big ADD voice (if you've seen the movie "Cabin Fever", he sounded like that Dennis kid that was always like "PAAANCAKES!") Anyway he kept doingh this until finally we were able to like walk away from them so he didn't have to be creepy. And the kid's like "SAAANDY WITH CAAANDY!" I shit you not. It was severely creepy. He must've been like 3 years old. I think he had tourettes or something, sereiously.  Yesterday at school, I had english, then TAG, then I went home sick. But. In TAG, we went on a walk for some reason.   Me: I don't wanna walk! I wish I didn't have legs.  Ashley: You don't know how creepy it is that you said that.   Then she explained to me about how lately she's been thinking about if you had to eat your own legs, what kind of situation you would have to be in to do that, and how long would it take for it to rot if you were in a deserted hospital of some sort. It's kind of complicated and a strange story and hard to explain and stuff so...yeah. And then we were all sitting in this courtyard after the walk.   Ashley: Nicole, how long would it take for meat to rot?  Nicole: If it's out here in the sun?  Ashley: No, like in a hospital room or something...  Me: Does this have anything to do with eating your legs?   Yeah anyway it was pretty funny. I was going to blog about people and things like that but I'm lazy and stuff so I guess that won't be happening. But. There's only 7 school days left! WAHOOOO! haha. Oh. I got my gradebook for Pr. Arts B today. My overall average in that class is like 46%. I guess it's a good thing I don't need that class next year, or else I'd have been fucked! Haha. Ah, well.  But, I must bid you adieu. The topics have been of the bye-byeing. lol. If that's a word. Anyways. Bye.   -Joebie
