Today I woke up at 11:45 because olive kept me up all night and I didn't want to put him outside.  I had a really scary dream. I dreamed that my grandpas doctors told him the exact date he was going to die and it was really soon.   but yeah.  Today i am going to do absolutely nothing!  I might pack for San Diego...we'll see :)  I can't think of much to say so I am going to go take a shower.  Adios!
