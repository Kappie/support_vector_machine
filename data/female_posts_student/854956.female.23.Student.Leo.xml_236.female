Rock and roll star, king, czar, and a kaiser! A roomful of friends! A mouthful of cake! Every present is for you, And it feels pretty great! You're the man of the hour, The V.I.P. You get the first slice, Of the P-I-E, But first blow out the candles, And make a wish, Put a smile on, 'Cause it's your birthday, bitch! Go, robot! It's your birthday! Go, robot! It's your birthday!  YAY! :-) Thank you to all who wished me well on my birthday around midnight... :-)
