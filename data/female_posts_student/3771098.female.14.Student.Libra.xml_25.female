I let this being called a slut thing build up until I freak out, and then everyone's like "you're blowing this way out of proportion." when i'm actually not, it's just the first time i've said anything about it. And actually, i'm glad it happened. I needed everyone to know that it's not cool to call me a slut or to tease me because even though I laugh the jokes off, they still hurt. And sometimes, every now and then I just need a hug and for someone to listen to me. Is that too much to ask? I really don't think so. And I need to learn to open up.    I'm an extrovert, so i have plenty of friends, and if I ever need someone to talk to, I have plenty of people to choose from, but there's this side of me that i don't let anyone see, because it makes me vulnerable. I think my one ultimate fear is getting hurt, so if i'm vulnerable i can get hurt, and i'll do just about anything to avoid getting hurt. I don't even really know why I have such a fear of getting hurt either. Maybe it's because of my Mom and me never really having a relationship like other mom's and daughters, or maybe I'll never really know. I dunno. What I do know is that if i keep on being scared of getting hurt, i'll never get anywhere, and i'll always be alone. Now that's scary. Being alone. That's all for tonight folks. Too tired for anymore.    Liz
