It took us like 20mins to get out of bed, because we couldn't even get INTO bed before 12.30 because James was being annoying and wouldn't get out of the room cuz he was watching a movie. Damn James. SO we got like no sleep. And then once we were well and truly up, Mum rang to say that mi ortho was actually half an hour later than she thought so we could hav slept in longer! Argh.. Don't you hate that? Then Gemmie and I took Tish 4 a walk.  Mum came and took Gemma and I with her. The Ortho was a disappointing visit. I won't get mi braces off 4 bout 3 months now, longer than they originally told me. Always happens but is still a bummer. And I was sayin how I was sick of havin stuff on mi teeth, because they happily informed me that after I got mi braces off, I had 2 wear a retainer full time for a year!!! How utterly crap. Then mi ortho goes up to me and says, "U've had your braces on 4 13 months now, and you had your other thing on 4 a year as well, so I think you're overexadurating a bit". I could have punched him. What a loser. That is ages!! And I hav 2 have stupid bands in 4 9 weeks, but I am so not wearing them when I go out. They are so totally horrible. Argh. Stupid ortho.  So then we bought me new clothes, which was good. :D I got 2 new pairs of jeans, a brown jumper and a spearmint top. :) Yay. And then we got food and went home. Gem and I were pushing it fine by then, and so once we got home, I changed, then we left 4 Glenrose 2 meet Mel. We were gonna have coffee, but ended up not. I bought chips and Mel and Gemma ate them all. How nice of them - not! :P Mel also brought apple sliced up in a little bag. Funni anorexic Melli. We saw Steph D and Yusuke, and we crashed their "bonding seesion" and had a chat 4 a while. It was nice. :D Haven't seen Steph in ages. Hehe, she as well was surprised about how much gossip I knew bout church. hehehe...being a gossip queen is fun fun!  So then we headed off to Nats house, Gemma, Mel and I. We arrived and started watchin this realli random movie called "Fried Green Tomatoes" which we gave up on and watched "Signs" instead when T1 and Monty came. So basically it was Nat, T2, T1, Monty, Bec (buckley, standing behind us painting) Jodie, Hannah, Mel, Gemma and I. Jodie was scared in Signs, and we all screamed at exactly the right times, on purpose. Bec found us absolutley hilarious. But T1 was the most scared, he sat there with his head in a pink pillow he was huggin rocking back and forth, and it was soo funni. Ash Bennet came 4 about half an hour after the movie finished. She had a hair cut and it was soooo cool!! We all had a nice chat 4 ages. The 3 guys had a wrestling fight, and it was quite scary. Hehehe...Mel kept on making unsubtle hints.  It was obvious who Monty likes, even thought he only narrowed it down 2 2people 4 me the otha day, but won't admit who it is now that I'm sure I know. The day was pretty good. But I am so totally exhausted. I was fallin asleep at the end of the evening.   I miss you.  Blogging off, Beth
