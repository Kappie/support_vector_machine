It's like Romper Room in here.  A minute ago I heard the pitter pat of feet pounding on the floor, running, and then I see these two guys emerge from behind the bookshelves, and what do you suppose they are doing--you guessed it, play-wrestling with each other.  Then, I'm trying to walk down the aisle to get back to my desk, and there is this crowd of people around one of the carrels, a girl is sitting on the floor blocking up the aisle...and they are all TALKING VERY LOUDLY.  There are these little things called exams preoccupying everyone at the present, so you'd think that all these people would have something better to do.  I mean, I'm not exactly studying at the moment, but I am not disrupting those who are trying to either.  Ah,  c'est la vie , I suppose.  Sometimes I wonder if people are really worth all the trouble...
