I'm so thankful that we were able to talk again... its been years since we last talked about real personal stuff. There are times that im longing for someone to talk to, someone to confide my emotions, someone i can count on, or someone i can just laugh with... i miss having a best friend and all those longings were actually gone just few hours ago. I actually felt like you were just here...
