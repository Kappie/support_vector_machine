This is the second time this week I've done my brother's papers. He's escaped off to camp. If "escaped" is the right term. So I ventured out into the cool morning in a tee-shirt, thinking surely the exercise would warm me up, right?  Wrong . My heart kicked in halfway through. I could imagine it -  must... make... warm... the... extremities... also . Aside from being slightly chilled, the walk was pleasant enough. I like sleepy times with no traffic :]. Walking right up to strangers' houses reminds you of all the humanity you've become numb to. A few people were awake. I got a dubious expression  (Why are  you  here?)  from a man heading off to work. Also a gentle, "Thank you, dear," from a lady watering her lawn. I was traipsing across lawns, but I didn't get yelled at from any kitchen windows, so people either didn't see or didn't care. I finished in about 30 minutes. My brother takes longer on his bike. Interesting. My path home wasn't full of dog do like the one my brother takes, either. I consider the neighborhood conquered on that front.
