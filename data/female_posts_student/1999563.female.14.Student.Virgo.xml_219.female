All my friends have all these stories about parents leaving them and not seeming to care and great tradgedies.  I have nothing like that. Two perfect parents.  3 perfect siblings, we never fight or yell. I have a nice (*cough*) house and lots of friends. We have kind neighbors who always bring us tasty cookies. I am as popluar as I want to be at school and my grades are good. I can afford to get clothes I like, whenever I want.   I have everything I could ever want. I have God.   But still, I am never ever satisfied. I often find myself depressed and trying to find my place in this world.  Why?  I love my place.  But I always want more.  I never think I am good enough for God, or even the wonderful friends I have.   Am I forever falling? Or do I have a place. A time.    A purpose.   I have read all these stories about people like Rachel Scott who lived whole heartedly for God, never turned back.   I want to do this.  I want to be like these people.  I want to be everything for God.  But I feel I shall never be perfect.  I am quick to anger, slow to love.  I judge people by there looks.  I scorn those who win my distrust.  I try to make my enemys weak so they finally break.  I feel this will finally make me better than them.  I will finally be popular and loved by everyone.  but really, people will never think that.  I have no intenntions for people to look at me and say "Wow, she is gorgeous, I bet she is really popular."  I want, no, I need people to look at me and say "Wow, she is amazing, she is living totally for God."  But, it is so hard.  I try with all my  heart to reach out and be a friend to the lonely.  But I don't want them to bring my social standings down. I will say hi to them in the hallways but I wont be a really friend.   I wont call them on the phone, invite them over, or even invite them to sit with me at lunch.  No, why would I want to do that? It might hurt me in the long run, I might lose friends.  But really, I have nothing to fear.  When giving up my friends for the less loved and unpopular I am gaining the   BEST  friend   Of ALL   God.    Don't Stare. Don't Judge.   Laura
