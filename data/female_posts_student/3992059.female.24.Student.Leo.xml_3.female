Plus it had to have a beautiful alter.  So I thought church shopping would be easy when dh and I decided that it's time to find a church.  Boy was I wrong.  Church #1.   Bust a move:   A few months ago dh and I went to his old church.  He told me that I'm in for a shock.  I thought to myself 'what kind of shock could it be to go to church?'  Boy was he right.  We walked in and went downstairs had some coffee and then went upstairs to church.  We didn't have the girls with us that day so it was pretty easy just going and seeing what was going on.  Anyway, I walk in and my general reaction was that what I would call an alter looked more like a rock concert.  There was a piano, drumset, and a couple trumpets sitting up there.  But on the plus side-instead of pews they had comfortable chairs that you could sit in and actually be comfortable.  After a few minutes the service starts and I was in shock.  Everyone was up dancing, singing, clapping their hands, and having a grand ole time.  All except me that is.  So this went on the entire service.  There was a baby dedication that day so I got to see their version of the baptism.  Dh later told me that they believe that children should choose to be baptised when they are old enough to do so and that the baby dedication is the parents dedicating the baby to live in God's way etc etc etc.  Sounded kinda like a baptism to me except with no holy water.  So I thought that I would never go back there.  Church #2:   Hometown:   After we moved to town we attended the local methodist church for a few months.  At first it was great.  I liked it a lot.  But as time went I didn't feel like it was the church for us.  Nice church, nice people, but it was way to small for me.  Perks:  in town and services start later which is good because we work midnights.  Cons:  too small, no real youth programs, the pastor goes to 3 different churchs.  Church #3:   The Needers:   Dh and I attended this church one Sunday.  Nice inside.  And the people were nice, but there were a few problems.  The first time dh and I attended, there was a missionary there.  He talked for over an hour.  My butt hurt just from listening to him ramble.  Everyone that came up to us seemed "needy" in some way.  They all were so persistant about us signing a visitors card and coming back next week.  We didn't go back the next week.  or the week after that.  But I went back the 3rd sunday, this time with the girls.  They were pretty open to SD6, but when it came to SD7, they were standoffish.  The Pastor didn't even say two words to me...or the girls.  I told dh about this and we have decided to not go back to that church.   Church #4:   the weak:   all I have to say about this is one word....weak.   So in the end, dh and I have decided to go to Church #1.  I never thought I would've gone back there, but I really did enjoy it.  They make the service fun.  omg...a church service fun?  who would've known?  Anyway.  I think everything will be ok there.  SD7 will get the one on one attention she needs and SD6 will have a children's service to go to and dh and I will be able to enjoy the church service.  I wonder what would happen if my parents were to go there?  Hmmm.....maybe not just yet.  I don't want to give them too big of a heart attack yet.... ;)
