They're very scary. There are these tiny little ledges that you're supposed to cross to get to a big ledge. Well i was about to cross one when I looked down and realized that I was like 200 feet up in the air, and I am not about to screw up my 300 thousand dollar back. No ma'am. So i freaked out and sat down right where I was. I honestly felt like Simba in the Lion King when Mufasa fell to his death. Then Allie slipped and almost fell. Well that freaked the shit out of me. Then after that we went to Wall Drug.  Wall Drug is a sad little town. If you'd even call it a town. There were just a bunch of shops. We went to get shakes, and they told us they only had hard ice cream, so we asked for a hat (those disposable Krispe Kreme kind) and they told us if they gave them away, they'd get fired. That was a lie, i mean how far do i have to pull my shirt down to get a freakin' hat? Seriously people! The guy there must have been gay. Then Me, Allie, Joel, Kirby, Amez, and Steven were gonna' take an old timey photo but we didn't have time. It would have been soo cool though.   When we got to the church, it was so cool. I've never seen a cooler church. Because we're up north now, (the midwest rather) there are way more Lutherans, so their church has more members, therefore is nicer. I busted out the Charlie Brown song on the piano. -lol- It was fun.  Then tonight we got in un argumento. After devotions and after we got to the church (which by the way was off the chain) Barbara and Nan pulled all the girls over to talk. I hate talks. They talked about how we dressed (aka, how I dressed) and then Nan calls Amez out and says (Amy, i've witnessed you rubbing up against guys). Well I freaked. I told Nan that it was not fair to call Amez out like that, and that she was not rubbing up against guys, and she doesn't even know us. Then Reba told me that I shouldnt' dissrespect the pastors wife like that. Well frankly I don't give a damn who she is, it doesn't give her the right to call someone out like that. Oh, and it really hurts my feelings that me and Amez are like the sluts of the church. They've even nick-named her the TDH, the team ho, and a bunch of other stuff. Barbara calls me out all the time on what I wear, just because i'm a D cup. Big deal. I can't hide the boobs. God gave them to me, i mean what do you want me to do about them?  Well after that, I started crying and ran to the bathroom. Then Jenn came in and freaked out, because I never cry. Never. and then Amez came in and Jenn left and we started balling, because it wasn't just this argument that got us rilled up, it was everything over the past year for me, and the past 2 years for her. Then barbara came in and talked to us until like 3 in the morning. We were screaming. Everyone was worried, and no one went to sleep. I seriously considered going home. After we calmed down enough to come out of the bathroom, we got our mattress and things from the girls room, and slept in the fellowship hall. It was a long night, and no one understands, and there's this weird untalked about silence. I hope it'll get better. Well, I gotta get some sleep so my eyes will stop swelling.   Liz
