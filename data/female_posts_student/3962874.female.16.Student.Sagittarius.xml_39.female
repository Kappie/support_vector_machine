Alex had a few people over earlier and it turned out that they were all planning to have a party at a place called the "Landing Pad". Daniel wanted to go so I told him he could, and I kind of wanted to go but I decided I needed to stay at home and work instead of going to a party and getting drunk with a bunch of dumb people. Not really. Yeah I do need to get out and do something but I couldn't because I was going to take a shower and there was no towels so I put some in the wash and they aren't done yet. I do want to go. Oh well. Daniel and Alex just left, I didn't tell them I wanted to go because I didn't want them to have to wait for me or come back and get me. I don't want to be a hassle. I would drive down there except for the fact that if I drank any I would have to find some sober person to drive my car back and I think all the sober people already have cars to drive. I'm stuck at home. Hopefully I will get some work done.
