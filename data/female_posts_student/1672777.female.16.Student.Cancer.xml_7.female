     
      Just last week, lots of things have happened to me and when i'm at my darkest times, i prayed and seek God and i really want to thank God for the strength and for comforting me. I prayed for a Word and God gave me Psalm 18:16-19:  Ps 18:16-19: He sent from above, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me, For they were too strong for me. They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the Lord was my support. He also brought me out into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.  I really want to thank God for this verse as this is the verse that i have been holding tightly and that through this verse, i found my strength to go through what i'm going through. Praise the Lord!
