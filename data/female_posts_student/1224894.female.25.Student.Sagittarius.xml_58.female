Ruel, had a few laughs, and somehow enjoyed lunch. It's very hot though, i doubt i'd be able to take a nap when i get home. Again, thanks to JCR, i'm back to Blog, and having a good time. I'll probably study this afternoon, then back to Church at 5. Hmmm....i love the song being played...there's this certain song banging in my head all day yesterday until early this morning, i couldn't get the title, but i seem to like the song. Weird, since it's a Filipino song. Anyway, hopefully, later tonight i'll be able to get it right. Oh well, no exciting news for me...Gotta go, i need to change my bed sheets already, and clean up my room. Thank God it's nearing vacation time...Brumhilda, here I come...
