HAH. i'm staying home for once tonight. yay! this past week has been too eventful. and tiring.. shit my fingers hurt really bad! i can't believe i lit myself on fire, well practically. i'm too dumb. there's only 2 weeks of summer left. so that sucks big ones.. i found out that we get our schedules on the 13th.. that's only a few days before school starts. how gay can they get?! whatever.  ***paxton's team won state.***
