Well, for me, this was to be another boring wedding reception, were you know all you're going to do is sit and whine.   Well, it was until Carole asked me if I wanted a drink. Erm, like a REAL drink? She was like whateverâ„¢ you want dear. I said, well, how about some Vodka. Without even telling my mom. She went up and got me one. I felt pretty cool. Standing there, with a drink in my hands. Oh yeah! Until the bartender came and asked me if I had some ID on me. I knew I wasn't of age to drink so, I said it was my friends. I was just holding it while she was dancing. He smiled at me and then left. Right at that moment, I knew I couldn't have anymore to drink, or else. But, on a normal trip to the washrooms. I ran into Jennifer, Tina and Amy. All my cousins, all up for a great time. They seen my drink, and they were like "Do you smoke?" That I simply refused to do. Nope. No. That's not me. The drinking was. At the end of the night, I had had a round of Tequilla shooters, 4 Smirnoff's, and a beer. I had never drank before. And, now. I have. I will be going to the next weddings for that side of my family. That was way past awesome! Now, I have a HUGE headache, I can't concentrate, and I'm all shaky...Ew. It was worth it though! Oh Yeah! I think I only did it because I was depressed. I kept the Smirnoff's coming, the tequilla was just another thing. More like a dare. Ouch. I miss Jenn. If she was here, I probably wouldn't have went to the stupid wedding. I would have went to her house to hang out and have some fun joking around. Either that or talked to Billy all night long!   Icky. Billy is also going through some hards times now-a-days. I think he misses Joey. His Ex. Joey and Billy were perfect for each other! I loved double dating with Shane. I was sure Joey had a thing for Shane even if Shane was straight, and Joey was gay. Bah, it's all the same. Billy needs to rest. I think he has always been there for me. I spent the night over at his house almost all week. I didn't go to school. Neither did he. We skipped together. It was great. Until we went in to the corner store to get some slushes and we say him. Joey. There, with a girl in a total make-out session. Now, I was friends with Joey. And he never told me he was Bisexual. What!?   Billy ran out of the store. I stayed there and watched Joey and his "gal" make out for awhile he finally got up, and said to me "Em, what in God's name are you doing?!" I looked at him and told him to check his in-voice, then check his sexuality...before going and using MY best friend - ever again! He just looked at me, and you could see he was embaressed. Well, why!? He seen out the window. There was Billy sitting down on the sidewalk. Probably counting the grains of sand. *sighs* Aww...Billy! Joey grabbed my arm, I pulled away and left to go outside. Fuck the slushes! Billy and I walked all the way home silently. Thing was...we were headed for my place. I wasn't going to stop and say everything I had planned. So I went to my house. When I got there, my parents were gone as for Tom and Mookie. Well, we're alone. Lucky us. Right then I realized my answering machine in my room has over 20 messages. 28 to be exact. Some from Joey, some from Jules, others from Mookie. Oh well, lets "delete" them all so it looks like I care. Deep breath now. Ok. Done.   Billy threw himself on my un-made bed. And just started to cry. Oh, Billy crying. Not a good thing. I looked at him and started crying too. So there we were, crying on a Wensday afternoon, in my bed together. We stayed that way until the phone rang, and I knew it was going to be Joey. It was. He was just talking and ranting and raving about how much he was sorry. I said not a word and hung up. That was the last time I talked to him. And I hope Billy and him get back together after he gets everything right in his life.   ..::Billy! I know you're reading this...and I just want you to know...I love you! And I'll always be there::.. ~S-em
