Why the sky is crying is a mystery. What could it have run into? Who could it be missing? Sometimes when the sky is crying I tilet my face upward and catch the tears on my cheeks, so that the sky's tears become my tears and I try to feel what the sky is feeling. But it never works. So I never know why the sky is crying.
