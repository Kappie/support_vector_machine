Well, Wednesday before Psychology I DID talk to SI Mike a bit.  But it was basically innocent flirting and chit chat.  I (apparently) was listening to my music and it was 'loud' and I was getting into one of the songs.  I think it was "Where Did You Go" by the Bosstones.  Anyhow, it's a good song!  Mike came over and he was like, mouthing words but not actually saying anything... argh!  So, I pulled my earphone away from my head and he just simply asked, "was that a good song???  cause it looked like it!" and smiled... and went back to reading whatever philosophical book he was reading.  Then I was finishing a chapter in this boring ass book called "The Crusaders" that I have to read to write a term paper for World Civ. and it was so boring that I threw the book onto the floor away from me.  Anyhow, he picked it up and gave it to me and asked, "What's the matter?  It's not good enough for you???"  His wit ASTOUNDS ME!  Anyhow, that night my Mom and I went to a UTSA Symphonic Band concert so I could get my second concert review done.  It was such a good concert!  Now I'm actually looking forward to being in band, because I know that it's good, and I won't be in a band with like, people that SUCK BALLS!  :-)  Oy, so, yesterday I had to stay on campus till like 3pm.  I had my first psychology experiment!  I finally got signed up for one!  It was boring... REALLY boring... we basically took a word problems test...  You know with stuff like, "Assuming the first two sentences are true, is the last sentence true or false?  ' Charlie has red hair.  Boys with red hair like chocolate.  Charlie likes chocolate.'"  Yeah... then we got to fill out a survey.  Oh well.  Then I got signed up for another one which is on Monday afternoon at 2:30-3:30.... and it's topic is Pitch Detection.  It sounds involved and fun... and I'm hoping it is!  Anyhow, so I've got 2 hours down and 2 to go for my experiments.  I also have a psychology exam AND a biology exam on Monday.  Which means a very UNFUN weekend for me comprised of LOTS of studying.  :-(  But, at least I have the football game on Saturday to look forward to.  And church, cause Jamey should be there, and Jamey can always bring a smile on her face.  Because we remember good times like when Sean had a bit of a crush on her, and when Ricky cut her hand with a pair of scissors in an attempt to scare the living crap out of her and me (which he did).   I'm not all that excited about having to be on campus so late, though.  On Monday, and for that matter, next semester.  I HATE being on campus into the afternoon.  There are some REALLY weird people around my campus.  REALLY WEIRD.  Like, UT Austin weird.  I really didn't think we had weirdos like that on our campus, but apparently we do.  Yesterday there was some odd looking fellow playing the bongos.  He was sitting on one of those beach mat thingys... like that's made out of woven grass.  Yeah, it was weird.  People on our main campus are much less empathetic to people that wanna catch a nap between classes and such.  I finally went to the HSS building after I had lunch and went over my notes for masterpieces, and I wanted to sleep for a bit cause I had like 2 hours before my experiment.  I had to attempt sleeping in one of those cubicle studying area things.  Yeah, the main campus doesn't have nice, comfy chairs and sofa things like we have in EVERY building at the downtown campus.  It was horrible.  I dozed off a couple times, but even when I did I was woken up by people that were screaming downstairs (the cubicle things are lined next to a balcony on the second floor so you can see and hear EVERYONE and EVERYTHING downstairs).  Anyway... it sucked.  I think on Monday, if it's not too cold, I'll take my scooby blanket and spread it out on the grass outside by the Sombrilla and sleep out there.  It just SOUNDS more comfortable.  I just hope one of the weird PERVS doesn't come over and try to lay on my blanket with me.      urlLink  postCount('8nov02');
