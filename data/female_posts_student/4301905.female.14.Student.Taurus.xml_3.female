I have a very quiet family. They get on my nerves a lot ,but I know they still love me. I have two half brothers who are basically regular brothers because I've lived with them all my life. I have two sweet and adorable dogs, Dewey and Abby. I also have a horse (Claire) and a pony (Andy). My parents are very well off but they're always complaining about how they're "broke". My mom is going back to school to become a nurse and I'm very happy that she's doing something she wants to do. My dad works at a start up computer company and they have some potential buyers in their computer chips. My dad always tries to explain it to me ,but it goes over my head a lot of the time. I adore CKY. I think they are by far the best band I've ever heard. I saw them in June at the Mall of America. They just blew me away with how awesome they are. I want to see them again ASAP, this time at a smaller venue. Everyone who's seen them says you can hang out with them after the show and go drinking with them..... I wish I could!!!! I love everything that Quentin Tarantino has anything to do with. I loved Kill Bill and I think he really out did himself with that movie. I can't wait to see what he does with Inglorious Bastards. I hate Good Charlotte. That's about it for now. Later.
