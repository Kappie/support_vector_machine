Anyway... now that I got that off my chest... I've been feeling very artsy lately...which is a good thing, right? And I'm actually getting better at it. I drew 3 portraits in a week... and Sepadai wants me to draw her...I think she said she'll pay me... but I don't really care... I do it for the enjoyment purpose... Although I  do  need the money. I'm going to Six Flags San Francisco in August... so yeah...      I find it so strange how the Ticketmaster system works. The week the tickets went on sale, all the front seats were sold out and the only thing available for months was the lawn seats. And now, the concert is only a month away, and the best seats are available! ...I'm feeling lucky lately...tooooo lucky.....hmmm.....
