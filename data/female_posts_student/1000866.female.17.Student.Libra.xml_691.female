I don't get headaches very often and I think I had one five minutes after getting to Kathryn's.   However, I have to say, I still had a good time. We all went to Kathryn's to make t-shirts for the relay for life walk for the American Cancer Society. We've made our team t-shirts and they're super cool. I love them. :) However...a certain person who shall remain nameless cough  MARY CLARE  cough couldn't just do what the rest of us were doing. She just had to be different. OK, I know I said I'd write four paragraphs on this but, it's difficult and so, I'll cease the Mary Clare bashing because she's too individualistic. Anyway, Nikki was there and Becky too. It was fun. It was nice seeing Nikki again after such a long time.   Then, we went to Mongolian Barbeque for dinner and that was nice, except we had to wait forty minutes to get a table. Gah. Oh well. I guess I shouldn't be an impatient American. It was nice. Then we caught up with Stephen, Jeremy, Amit, etc. at Meadow Glens. Fun times. Yes...  Stressful day though. This is why I'm thankful I have guy friends.
