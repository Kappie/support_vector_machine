The kids were cool and I got to demo a lot of cool merchandise. I love the Airzooka and the Hoverdisck I might have to buy some for my friends and family.  The only problem I have with my job is when all the summer camps come to the store at once and none of the kids have more than $3 to their names, but they still want to buy everything in the store. It gets so crazy in the store and their like a million little kids in your face the entire time. I is so exhausting. Thank goodness that I had my lunch break right when things were getting really crazy. I still had a lot of fun.  I like all my co-workers they are so cool and funny. We were just laughing all day. I really like this guy Jeff he is really cool and kind of cute. Not so much physically cute, but he has that awesome personality that everyone is just drawn to. Yeah he is pretty cool. I really liked my team today Jeff, Liz, Erin, Kurt and Alexis are all very cool I hope I work with them more often.   The only person that gets on my nerves is Susan. She is my supervisor and she gets shackened really quickly and totally favors guys. She reminds me of this teacher at my school Miss Westfall that totally craves male attention like all the time and she doesn't even care if they are underage.   Well, I have to go. I'm off to see Fahrenheit 9/11, with my mom since Ross went to go see it with his sister yesterday.   Have a nice night ya'll
