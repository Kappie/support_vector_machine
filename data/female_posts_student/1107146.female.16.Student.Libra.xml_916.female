The "live" sonogram and vital signs keep repeating themselves. And just logically, what hospital in its right mind would approve a study like this? Especially doneon a human before trying it multiple times on an animal? The thing in Time is fake- there is someplace that you can put your own face on the cover of Time, just like you can on the Wheaties box.And the other link talks about sea horses, not about human male pregnancy. Sorry to bust your bubble, but this one isn't real.
