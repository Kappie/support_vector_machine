OKay so I try to think of myself as a happy, optimistic, friendly, blah blah.. person, so I guess it hurts me when someone calls me a bitch. I mean yes..i can be a bitch, but I'm only a bitch if you give me a reason to be. If you treat me like shit...well you know what I'm going to treat you like the bacteria that grows on shit. No I'll treat you like the bacteria's shit and I don't even know if bacteria takes shits..oh well. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I'm not a doormat. I'm not going to let everyone walk all over me. I personally think there's nothing wrong with being a bitch. Some of the coolest girls I know are bitches. Jenna and Ren are my favorite bitches. And it's not like we're constant bitches...we know when to turn our bitch switch on or off. You bitches rock. ha. This entry is dedicated to the fucker that called me a bitch. Thank you for the inspiration. But anyways. I must go clean. bitches.  Words to add to your everday vocabulary:   Grasspile ; ex: "That's not what your  grasspile  said last night."  Fond ; ex: "I'm  fond  of his insides..not outsides."  Fellatio ; ex: "While I was giving my boyfriend  fellatio  last night.."  Fuck ass ; ex: "Cody Brown is such a  fuck ass ."  Ahoy hoy ; Say that next time you answer the phone, like Ian does..it's so much better than saying hello.
