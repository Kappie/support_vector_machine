Me....the one who wears long sleeves in summer. Scary scary scary. I also got a new pair of jeans, and a new t-shirt, and yeeeesh, I'm a shopaholic. I admit it. I have a problem. I think that's step one...admitting you have a problem. Hmmm. Yes. Well, anyway, I was going to write about what I'm thinking but I don't really feel like it anymore. I guess I can write about something, because it really bothers me. I wish people would realize how well off they have it compared to the rest of the world. You know, I mean....not all people certainly. I bet people are going to think I'm talking about them in this. Like, certainly not people who are unhappy because of something big that happened, and they can't really help it, or people who's parents are really really tough to live with, but....I guess. I don't know. A lot of times, I think people can be really selfish. I know I can too, but...when it's excessive, that's when it really bothers me. Ah well, I guess I should just go now or something.
