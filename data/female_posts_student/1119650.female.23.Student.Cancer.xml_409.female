It needs to be the same black and pink that my blog colors are and it needs to say "Musings of a Dynamite Diva" (I don't care whether or not you work in the mumblings rumblings and stumblings part) and I want a bomb with a reverse "D" logo like the one picture here (but black and pink black and pink!!!!)    Good luck, lets get creative and the winner will get hella crazy mad props (hows that for an incentive, eh??)
