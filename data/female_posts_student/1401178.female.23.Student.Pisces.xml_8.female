With the addition of my darling little sister...wait, my darling sister, we think the blog need a facelift...well, a title-lift...wait...oh whatever. Since my sis will also doing some posting, the range of subjects we're going to review is wider. My sis, the self-proclaimed curly haired rock chick, is totally into music. She will doing some album reviews, among other things. Hopefully this would fill in the blog (since I haven't doing any updating for a while now). Enjoy!
