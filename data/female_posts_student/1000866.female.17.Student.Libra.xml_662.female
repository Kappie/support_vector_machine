My French final wasn't too bad at all. the oral (shut up you sick pervs) part was a lot easier than I expected, but there were some parts to the regular part that were more difficult than I expected. Oh well. I'll just hope I did well. Anyway, gym was bad because right before I had to do my final routine for gymnastics, I got this AWFUL stomach ache. It was terrible. Like, I was doubled over in pain. Oh man. I shudder just to think of it. I did the routine though. I was tough. RAR!!!! TAKE THAT GYMNASTICS ROUTINE!! OK, I'm done, really.   Just a side note though. Don't you hate it when you aren't paying attention to what's being written and somehow your caps lock gets pressed and you start writing in caps and you don't relize it for a long time and you have to go back and change everything. Grrr caps lock. But yeah, after gymnastics, I went home and took a small nap. That was nice. It was only like...half an hour but it was BEAUTIFUL! Then, I drove all the way downtown Naperville and I'm looking for a spot so I can meet my friends at Noodles and my cell phone rings..."Hello?"..."Hey Catie. This is Kelly. I'm really sorry but...we're going to the Noodles in Bollingbrook." AHHHH! Haha. It was ok though. I just drove home. Then MC, Kel, and I all went to Noodles and it was super. Yum yum. Sexist soy sauce was there...hah. It never gets old to Kelly. She's so funny. Silly child. It was good seeing them though. I haven't seen them in a few days.   Tomorrow, I have my lunch final. That's gonna be a tricky one. I'm going to see if I can sleep through it...in my bed, at home. :) Then, I have math. Good times? Then, I'm going out to lunch with them AGAIN because Kath didn't get to go today. Heh. Should be fun though.   I found out Joanney's not coming home until August 5th. :( That makes me a very sad Catie.   Anyway, I'm off to sleep...or something. But first...a little song from Hillary Duff....  Hey now, hey now Hey now, hey now.... Have you ever seen such a beautiful night? I could almost kiss the stars They're shining so bright When I see you smiling I go Oh-oh-oh I would never want to miss this 'Cause in my heart I know what this is  Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of I've got somewhere I belong I've got somebody to love This is what dreams are made of  Have you ever wondered what life is about? You could search the world and never figure it out You don't have to sail the oceans No-no-no Happiness is no mystery It's here and now It's you and me  Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of I've got somewhere I belong I've got somebody to love This is what dreams are made of  Open your eyes This is what dreams are made of Shout to the sky This is what dreams are made of  When I see you smiling, I go Oh-oh-oh Yesterday my life was duller Now everything's technicolor  Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of... Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of I've got somewhere I belong I've got somebody to love This is what dreams are made of
