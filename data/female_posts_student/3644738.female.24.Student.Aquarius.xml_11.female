With all the problems I was having back in London ....it seems that the problem is ME cos now I seem to be the thorn in the backside of Cecil, my 33 year old male cousin (once removed (I think that's right)) and his girlfriend Jalika!!!   Basically the house is split on three levels....Melvina, my female cousin, her son and myself sleep upstairs; the living room/dinning area and kitchen are on the ground floor and my Cecil and Jalika have a bedroom and living room in the basement but they use the living room area as a bedroom (why is this important.... because that area doesn't have a door)   Prelude....Anyhoo late one night I'm watching TV and Jalika comes up and says "Can you turn the volume down" .....I'm not aware how sounds travels and as it is late ...fair enough!!     On Friday night I'm in the living room (it's 9:30pm) I'm having a phone conversation with Cece in the living room and being the funny Mo Fo that she is...she is cracking me up!!!!  So I'm laughing....next I hear Cecil shouting at the top of his voice "SIMONE, SIMONE some people are trying to sleep down here!!!!!"......Now I'm vex....cos it wasn't that serious...remember it was 9:30pm.......  As we all know how sensitive I is....I go upstairs as it is in my best interest to prevent a bad situation from getting worse.   When I approach him the following day (Saturday), telling him not to speak to me using that tone he says "I only shouted to be heard, not because I was mad...ask Jean Claude, I don't get angry".  Yeah that explanation may seem plausible to you but you know me....I like to read between the lines.  [ME READING BETWEEN THE LINES] Firstly, why would you ask me, a 23 year old female to ask my 9 year old cousin (twice removed (I think I'm getting good at this family tree stuff (I mean I hope))) if you have a temper?  My interpretation...you see me has a kid (as you want me to consult with a pre-pubescent child) thus do not have the same respect for me as you would your peers.  Secondly, you would have never done that to Melvina (his older sister)......He hugs me and if I didn't accept the gesture and be cool....I'd be the asshole in the situation.......so I let it SLIDE.   Today  (Sunday) was the icing on the cake, Jalika (who I believe until this evening I get on well with) asks if I wanna go to the mall with her....so we go and share a pleasant afternoon.... WARNING FEMINIST CONVERSATION @ THE MALL (sometimes I should just shut up): I get into Feminist mode when she mentions that she is going to "cook some spinach for (her) man".  I ask if Cecil expects her to cook and she gets defensive and says "No, I know he likes African food so I choose to cook it for him"  My next question is, "So what household chores does he do?"...she replies "Well he goes to work" and then mentioned the odd occasions when he does the laundry and yesterday when he vacuumed the basement.....Later on that day she brought the subject up again.....I'm thinking to myself...Damn!!!!  Looks like I've opened a can of worms cos I ain't thinking about that conversation anymore so why is she.  When we get home she starts cooking....As I haven't been able to get into contact with Sabastian for a while...I try him again and we talk for about an hour and a half, then I make a couple of calls to London and go back downstairs....all the lights are off and she is in the basement (probably with "her man") as has been the case 80% of the time this weekend because Melvina and her son are away for the weekend.......... (generally they spend most of their time together downstairs, the only time I really get to speak with Jalika is when he is not there)    ANYHOO I get something to eat..( IN HINDSIGHT: I guess she hears the pots making noise so) she comes upstairs (at the time I didn't know why because she went right back downstairs).....About 10 minutes later she comes back upstairs, sits by me and tells me the following "Something is really bothering me, you know when you said 'does Cecil expect you to cook for him all the time'", I interject thinking that she revisiting the subject matter for a third time ...Then she says "No it's not that....it's YOU" Who Me...I start thinking about what I could have possibly done to upset her.......She continues "After all your talk about me cooking for Cecil, when we got home you didn't help me cook but you were the first to eat and I don't think that's right"  Now I'm floored, what can I say....I didn't have a cold calculated cunning plan to get out of cooking and be the first to enjoy the fruit of her blood, sweat and tears....Only for a millisecond I wanted to jump into "Rude Jude" mode (Yes I apologise for having watched the Jenny Jones Show) and say "Well I thought you enjoyed cooking.....Oh I'm sorry.....only for your man...right?" BUT as I have to live with Jalika and Cecil (who would also become my arch enemy if I said that) for the next 7 weeks I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers.... so when I'm not quite sure who is the winner in the battle of righteousness I just apologise...so I said "Sorry" and she went downstairs.   I guess I really have mastered the art of pissing people of......do you think I can get a internationally recognised qualification for that??  I'm joking right now but I was really upset....yes I'm sensitive!!!  So what are the rules I can only eat if I "hep out" or if I don't help with the preparation of the meal I must wait until everybody else has eaten......(errr excuse me I have a question...What if y'all ain't ready to eat yet...how long to I have to wait)   Boy right now I'm sitting here thinking I can't live with anyone...... is it I who is lacking in "the social skills"?  I don't understand HUMAN BEINGS!!!!   My plan for the next 7 weeks of my vaction.... exile myself in the uppermost chamber of the castle...and live on a diet of toilet paper and tap water!!!!
