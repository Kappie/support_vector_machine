Like you get it first and not anybody else (maybe not in my class..). This feeling will only apply to my Harry Potter movie and books and McDonalds' stuff. BUT never Hello Kitty OR  Finding Nemo.... The Beagle so furry and soft and fits for any sizes of heads (o_0).It is just like a mini cushion, you can carry it around wherever and whenever you are... Gosh, I sounded so much like a advertiser....
