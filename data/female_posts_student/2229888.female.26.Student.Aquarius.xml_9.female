You know what i mean.  my bro and i are looking into getting an apartment around here, but for now, i am basically homeless . . not so bad off that i need to go out to the highway with a cardboard sign in tow, at least . . .      my grandma left my step grandfather (thank god) he is a major ass . . .       i gotta go now . . .been sick for the last three days and i'm on a major tylenol buzz . . .
