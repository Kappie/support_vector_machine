So i started walking *long story, but i get picked up down the road cuz i like walking* and get stuck in the pouring rain becuz my dad is really late.  And do i have a cell fone to call home and ask on? NO! my fucking family needs to catch up with technology.  I'm working not too close to home and i NEED A FONE! Yeah so now im in a grr mood and will take my frustration out on all forms of junk food.
