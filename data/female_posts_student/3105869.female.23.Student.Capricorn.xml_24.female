The people at the condo group are going to take care of Mauruce, Hopefully he will be able to go back to work there now that he is no longer a care taker full time. It is almost tragic that you have to use a Blue Book and therefore write by hand! Enjoy your last hours in Spain as much as is possible and enjoy the trip to England. Love, Dad   Worthless, come on.  Anyway so off to London tomorrow I have to go to bed shortly, but I love you all and Have pics of Toledo today.  Besos
