So get back, back, back to where we lasted, Just like I imagine, I could never feel this way, So get back, back, back to the disaster, My heart's beating faster, Holding on to feel the same.  This may never start,  I'll tear us apart, Can I be your enemy,  Losing half a year, Waiting for you here, I'd be your anything, So get back, back, back to where we lasted, Just like I imagine, I could never feel this way, So get back, back, back to the disaster, My heart's beating faster, Holding on to feel the same.          Hmmm.... moms surgery was yesterday. They went in there and took out all the un-nessecary stuff that was in there i guess. i dont really kno i'm not a boob expert. But anyways, i'm up all early tryna to help her out. I guess the medicine and stuff made her very sick. She already threw up like 3 times... y-to tha-uck.      Walmart opens next week... so therefore i probably will be laid off for a couple weeks. Ugh, who knows... they might even just fire me. Wouldn't that be grrrreat.       I get paid today.. but i gotta save it until next week cause i'm going school shoppin... yea real interesting stuff in this entry riiight? I'll write more later...
