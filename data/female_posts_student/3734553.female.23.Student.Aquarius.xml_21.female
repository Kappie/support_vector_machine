My professors are the ones in charge of orientation and one of them made the opening remarks this morning. He is going to be my favorite, I can already tell. He is really old and considered an expert in four different fields of law, which is huge. He has an eye patch, was an English major, and was in the Navy. He told this long story and went into a spill about how our stock and trade were words. And his is the only class that I don't have a huge assignment for the real first day of class.  In Legal Research and Writing she gave us three cases to brief. Kind of a crash course, learn it on your own, and we will go over our mistakes in class. I started studying at 5, took a 45 min. break, and I'm still only 2/3s done at 11. But I love it, and I'm determined to have all the right answers tomorrow. Some of the other groups only had like three pages to read. Which is a bummer because they all got to go out together, but my group will be ahead of the game at the start of next week.  Supposedly I'm in the good section (according to the 2Ls I met today). He said all the good professors tend to stick together in one group and that then the students are put into sections by ability, in order to encourage closer competition. Who knows if they were telling me the truth. I like my profs, regardless.  A girl I went to Africa with, and a girl I know from AM, are both in my entering class. But not in my section, so I probably won't see them much.  So...back to studying...
