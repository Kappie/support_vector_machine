At the Show du Talent, it's probably gonna be something more exotic and less evil sounding, like "Exiled Children of Zion" or "Exuberate Proliferation" or something ghey as this. Everyone come! 7pm on the 19th (Thursday) !!!111oneoneeleven Yes, I've posted this on probably about every message board, BLog, and Xanga I know of, but it's imperative that everyone knows. Heheh, well actually, we're not in yet, the tryoots are next keskiviikko (mercredi (Wednesday)). But man...just hope for us.  Or "Endomorphic Dragqueens". I think that's a fun one.
