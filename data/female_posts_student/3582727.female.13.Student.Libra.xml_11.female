Interesting...  Then I go to Blogarama's list of Most Cool Blogs, and I see that  the  Most Cool Blog just happens to be a pornography site. As though that isn't enough, this blog is a pornography site with a rating of one out of ten. Yes, there  is  a list of highly rated blogs, but all the same I can't help wondering,  What is the world coming to?
