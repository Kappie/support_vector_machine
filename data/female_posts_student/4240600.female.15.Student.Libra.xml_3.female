Anyway, I bought the Jason Mraz CD and some new headphones and had some chicken with my family for dinner since my aunt and uncle and cousin came up to ask me about my sailing trip.      Umm...that's pretty much it. I didn't really do anything today, I just took some pictures of my backyard, went out to dinner, and watched my cousin, Jon play Medal of Honor.      I've been feeling really pathetic lately...I can be so hopeless sometimes...but when Igor said I was a very romantic person, that made me feel a lot better, not as completely sad.
