Has anyone else ever wondered why smilies don't have hair?! I certainly do. I think its kinda strange...maybe I'm the only one who thinks so.   Something else you (whoever you are. prolly no one) should know about me. I'm one of those crazy people. The "cutters." "Sick puppies" as others have called us. Yes, I cut myself. I don't think anyone besides the cutters themselves, and sometimes not even them, truly understand why one would harm themselves like that. Cutting is also addictive for some. It seems, after the first time you try it, next time your in that emotional state, you feel the urge to do it again, sometimes not even when your upset just any ole time. You feel like you "need" to cut.  For me, cutting is an outlout for all my anger, frustration, pain, sadness or whatever type of emotion I'm feeling at the moment, that has become too overwhelming. It's a way to "numb" the pain, "bleed the pain," or "kill the pain."  When I cut, it calms me tremendously. It eases the emotional pain. As I read back over this, its still exactly what I wanted it to say.  I can't even describe the exact reason why I cut. I guess that's just something you can't understand unless you experience it yourself. Yes, I do know that cutting is dangerous and stupid. Don't think I haven't been told a few hundred times. By my parents, my friends, my school councelor, my therapist, my principal, my teachers, and a few odd people that found out. I realize how I should find some way else to vent my anger. I've tried other ways. I've tried popping myself with a rubber band when I felt the urge to cut. It isn't enough. I've also thought that since if I do cut-people would see the scars. So I tried other forms of SI. (SI- self-injury). I tried burning myself. It wasn't enough. I tried pinching myself hard with my nails. That wasn't enough. Banging my head against a wall, or concrete. That doesn't quite do it either. I also tried to do other things instead of SI. I tried writing, to get my feelings out. But the whole reason why I'm that angry or upset, is because I don't know how to put my feelings into words. So the writing didn't work. It just made me angrier that I couldn't.  Calling a close friend helps. But, normally when I'm in that state, its late at night and my phone has already been taken away and I doubt that their parents would appreciate a 3 am phone call from me. I've tried screaming into a pillow--its way too loud.  Before I started to SI, I'd listen to my music. Music plays a huge role in my life as I've said before. When I was in the state, I'd go to my room, and blast my music. Then my 'rents got the lovely idea that they should take my stereo from me. No more music. Although I still had a small one and my portable one, I couldn't get that loud music that I needed.  Crying actually helps alot. Just to lay on my bed, or underneath my desk (which is in the corner so its a great hiding spot) and cry for hours. That would help, although I don't have that kind of time to spend. I'd have about 10 minutes max before mother or father come yelling at me to get my ass out of my room, lose the attitude and quit being a bitch. Yeah. Very supoortive parents, eh?   I'm a freak. *whoo* Yeah, most people that know me consider me a freak. I wear mostly black. Band tees and whatnot. I wear dark eye makeup. I listen to different types of music than everyone else. I like different things than they, and I'm also considered a bitch. I think the latest news I've heard about me was that I'm a "gothic bitch." Oh yeah, did you also know that I worship the devil and I'm going to hell? Or that I'm a witch and I put spells on peopel at school? Really? Neither did I. Someone informed me of this the other day. Isn't that interesting how someone you hardly ever talk to knows more about you than you do? Oh well I guess. That's not the first time I've been accussed of worshiping the devil. People have even asked one of my close friends if I do.
