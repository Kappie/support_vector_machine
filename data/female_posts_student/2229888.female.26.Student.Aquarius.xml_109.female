I don't know if you know all about it already, but you know the amrk of the beast? (666) well, there's a computer chip out RIGHT NOW whose numeric properties come down to 666, and they are testing it on soldiers and children. It's implanted uner the skin in your hand. Walmart around her already has a place shaped like a hand, where you can place your hand to purchase things!!!  It's not usable yet, but it's there.  that's freaky! Anyone who takes that mark will be choosing hell over heaven and they might not know it! I don't think children will be suseptible, because they are beneath the age of accountability. Anyway, all this stuff is scary.  We also had some really good music. My church is non-denominational, not baptist, or pentocostal, or anything like that. The music is awesome. There's a decent band that plays anything from rock praise to soft worship. (all christian of course!)  my stupid self (who LOVES to sing) couldn't keep myself from singing a few songs, and did I pay for it! My throat was killing me by the end of service!
