So after rolling out of bed around 10, I decided I wasn't going to "waste" my day away by sitting in the living room on my computer, and watching "Best Week Ever" on Vh1.  So, I made a couple errands all before the strike of noon!  You know how it goes: Bank, Haircut, Store.  Then came home--to show off my new do!--and read my amazing book (that I'm surprised am not done with yet), and call up a couple people to plan out our evening.  That was the predicament of the afternoon: Brewer Game, Or Manchurian Candidate?  We would be going to the Brewer Game with Kevin and Ryan-"we" as in Nicole and I- and all of his High School friends that we really don't know that well.  OR  The Manchurian Candidate with the "Three Amigos," Kate, Nicole, and I.  So, after thinking a while about the difficult situation, I thought, haven't seen Kate in a while, and in order to keep our friendship...I really think it should be a girls night...even though I was tempted to hang with Hot guys all night.  So prior to my "girls night," I went with my brother to get his own Haircut.  If you've ever seen my brother...he has a full head of hair, shaggy style, and all of a sudden he says, "you know what?  I think I wanna get a haircut, and cut it all off, so then I can grow it back over the school year!"  I thought it would be cool to see my brother with short-short hair, seeming as though he hasnt had it short in like 3 years.  So, we head on over to the Cost Cutters on Silvernail around 5:15: 45 minute wait...no, so head on over to the Cost cutters on Meadowbrook...30 hour wait...no, I have to be at the theater by 6:30!  So then our last resort was Great Clips on Moreland...So I guess that would have to do, since it was now 5:30!  So we walk in...and I swear it was a scene out of  Rocky Horror Picture Show!   There was the one girl, who says to us as we walk in "Welcome to Great Clips my name is Deb, what can we do for you" like it was programmed it to her, with a monotone, lifeless voice.  So, I answer her question, reluctantly, "um...he needs a Haircut, a BIG one!  So as I look around at the "high school drop outs" working there, I see a woman, who is "pierced" at least 5 times that I could see!  Two in her nose, One in her lip, and a "mutiple" of piercings (that I consider one, cause I couldn't count them all!)  Her hair was poorly dyed, and she had made temporary dreads with gel that morning...doesn't she sound like a winner?!  The other, "stylist", was suffering from over-exposure from the sun, and dyed her hair in the dark!  Plus the fact that she looked like the female version of Chewbacca!  No Joke!  So, the final middle aged lady, i don't know what she was, she just stood there, and watched everyone cut hair...She had clown makeup, and looked like she had a Lion's Mane!  It was three different shades of roots, and was blown up and out, probably trying to get the "volumizied" effect...gone a stray!  So...the haircut...the main reason we were there, was sooooooooooooo damn long, it was ridiculous!  ok, he has longer hair...shave some time by just cutting chunks off so the electric shaver doesn't get clogged! But no, this lady took fucking forever!  We walked in the doors at 5:30, didn't leave til 6:25...It shouldn't take so damn long to cut a guys hair!  I was livid!  She was so tidious it was unnecessary!  No need to take 6 minutes, styling a BOYS hair!  Put gel in it, mess it around...and you're done!  Ahhhh  I was such in a hurry to get out of there, because I had to be at the theater by 6:30, and I still needed to drop the bro off, and eat something!  Ahh  So needless to say, she did a good job, but I didn't have the time, nor the desire to give her a tip!   Manchurian Candidate, got to the theater at 6:50, movie started at 7, so I wasn't late, but still I hit every, single, freaking red light on the way there!  Overall, the movie was really good!  I thought the plot was good, a little predictable, but still had you shocked at the end!  Go and see!   Then we got some food, and headed on over to Nicole's to chill, talk to her brother, and just catch up with Kate, whom we haven't seen in a long time because shes ALWAYS with her boyfriend.  It was a good night, and good day!  Off to watch some Moulin Rouge...Damn good movie as well!
