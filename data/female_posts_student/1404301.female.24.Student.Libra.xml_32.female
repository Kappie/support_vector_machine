Interesting but long. the presentation lasted for 2h30min. a record I think in the history of the course.  Anyway, it can't be an excuse I suppose and I really appology for that. Dylan is is much more disciplined than me - and his blog is actually fantastic - have a look by clicking  urlLink here !!  Have fun!
