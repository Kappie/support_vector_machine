Everyone says Karen it's a 1st for goodness sake, but me being the ultimate perfectionst is yes, but only just and what about the other 29%? And why did I get 75% for my last assignment from these lecturers and this time only 70%? I asked the lecturer and he was like 'maybe I was having a bad day' ummm....that fills you with confidence - the basis of my future rests on whether or not my lecturer is having a bad day.  and as usual I got comments like 'could discuss this further, could write more about this, what about this person's theory?' like if I had an infinite number of words then I would have.  I asked the lecturer what I could have taken out in order to discuss these other things, and he said nothing!!!! What is a girl supposed to do?!! Grrrrr.  Moving day has arrived. I hate change.
