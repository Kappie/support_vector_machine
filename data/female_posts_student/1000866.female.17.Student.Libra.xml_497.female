It was really neat, b ut realllly hard to breathe down there, especially since I have a cold.   It was funny. We went to a pharmacy...or, farmacia...heh, not much different, and I wanted to get some cold medicine and...it just took a while since the lady definitely didn't speak very much Enlgish. Plus...I wanted the non-drowzy stuff so that I can take it in the morning before I go...so, my mom was trying to communicate to her and...it was just really funny. I'm like..."mom, you're talking to someone who can't speak English very well, not a baby..."  It did rain today unofrtunately but...hopefully that'll be it. Alright...I guess I'm going to go sleep now o0r something of the sort. I have to wake up realllly early tomorrow.
