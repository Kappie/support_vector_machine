I aced the spanish and health and got a C in geometry which gives me B in the class or a C, who knows, I don't care. I'll care two weeks from now when the report card shows how much of a failure I am and my mom gets mad haha. I came home afterwards and basically I laid down from 1-7 just thinking and slept occasionally. Talked to Ana on the phone for a bit, she's a doll for calling. Yeah I don't really have anything else to say about what I've been thinking about because it's been the same thoughts repeating itself and I can't come to any sense of it, my brain's just thinking of a bunch of good memories and a bunch of bad flaws...Anywho, then my mom came home and took me to get my gym membership for 3 months so I have the whole summer to work out at their fitness center woo hoo, I love working out. When you work out, thoughts fade away and all your focused on is the pain but the feeling of finishing something. Then we got some vides to rent, got along came polly miracle reminded me of a gr8 memory and some other. My mom's getting a new car or she said she's looking for a new one so who knows, hopefully I can get the rav4. Art text me 2day 2 do something but I couldn't cuz I didn't have the car at the moment and plus I was feeling pretty down when he called so I'm sorry but maybe 2morrow. Man, one last final tomorrow. Szabo's giving me a ride home, thanks. I could've walked but he said I'm getting a ride haha.  argh g2g wake up at 8 2morrow...
