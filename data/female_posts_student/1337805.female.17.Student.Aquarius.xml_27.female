It's so hard to leave them, and when you do, the world seems foreign....strange..unchanged. The harsh realism of cruelty, inequality, and injustice between people, places and things. It's almost, to say icky, and you need a break from it all..one day with you family, one day with friends, then the world..you can't just jump into it all and expect to understand everything like before..  Memories stand out from my head and explode onto the screen...First being my adventure on a plane. I've never flown before in my life. In fact I've never left the province. I've lived a rather shetlered life here on the island, and I'm exploring it fro the first time...  Damn, I'm so tired, I'm still on Pig/Flatatoba time, so I need to go to bed...get back to normal...
