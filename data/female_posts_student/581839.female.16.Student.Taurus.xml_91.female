I know that mary said i shouldn't care about smith, but we went over to visit them the other day, you know, to take them out to dinner, and tonight margaret came into the room. i asked her simply and kindly, sort of randomly, where she was going, because she seemed to be... ready to go somewhere. and she said, no not at all, that she was working on some papers. i go to ask her a question 5 minutes later, and i'm calling her name. she doesn't answer. so i go to look outside, and lo and behold, her car is gone. so, i'm trying to get all this advice for rain music, so i call the most music-est person i know who should be home, smith, and their not there. i'm guessing she went out again tonight. which makes me sad, because she should've told me the truth. she just yelled at me about lying and about her being violated, when she goes and violates me. it's simply not right. I have to wake up very early tommorow because i have play practice at 830AM. i don't think i'll make it there on time. Better go, i've got to make my CD. Julia
