I'm driving Nick to his class and then taking off down 23 so I can clean the rest of my room and feel absolutely content with myself.   Henk passed out on his couch last night. Though I didn't really want to invade, I ended up on Nick's couch for the second time in the past week. We had some pretty good conversation. Here's a scary fact, middle name is Andrew... sound familiar to anyone? He's Leah's sign, Libra. I'll have to do some research. I'll ask him if he was serious about the spell casting he seemingly jokingly asked for. I don't know what to say or do anymore. In some respects I just feel I should shut up, turn around, and move on. I'll get over it. I've just have to keep a little Mike in the back of my head to give me reality checks when need be.   AHHH! I hate this keyboard....  I off to the land of Nick, Fiji, and nothingness in between. I really wish Michelle would come home...
