The quiet has never been awkward; it has wrapped us in its warm arms and bestowed a quiet solitude more fulfilling than all the chatter the world can offer. Around you I'm happing being quiet, I'm happy dreaming about my future, our future, I'm happy listening to your heartbeat with my head upon your chest. I love holding your hands and peering at your fingers. They are long and thin and graceful with broad yet slender fingernails, an exact opposite of my short fingers and masculine nails that are broad and short and constantly breaking. I love your hands. Perfection could be found in those hands.
