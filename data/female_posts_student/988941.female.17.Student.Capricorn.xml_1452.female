You made an arguement out of nothing. Nicki, I stand by you as all you were trying to do was sort things out. DAvid. Lay of the sarcasm and stop being a fucking arsehole basically.  Hey and goodbye Andy :)  Oh and this isn't the only reason I'm leaving. I never have anything to post about and generally I forget I'm even part of this blog. You can leave me on if you wish and I will poist once in a blue moon. But for the time being I don't want to be part of it.
