Friday: i went ice skating with Jessi and co.  It was fun but the ice was terrible!!!  I swear, there were canyons in the ice.  I told Taylor Kubic that if i ever dated him, it would be like incest because he's so much like my brother.....he thought that was funny.  All in all, a good night. Nathalie also told me that there's a possibility that Coppell might still have the chance at a state title....she heard it from mark gillings and i dunno how reliable he is as a source.....but basically she told me that Plano Wesst cheated in a way because they were playing a guy that had been suspended for grades...and apparently he scored 2 of plano west's goals in the game where they played us.  Since they cheated they should have to forfeit all the games in which he played where he was supposed to be suspended and in other words all those games, including games at state, would be counted as losses.  In other words, they can't have won state because they'd have to forfeit it.  Apparently, according to Mark whom Nathalie heard from, this whole ordeal is under review by the league and they might either make us play Clear Lake for the title or make Clear Lake automatic champion.....although that might mess up who gets 2nd or 3rd place at state.....i dunno its confusing. But that would be so awesome if that happened!    Saturday: i had my sweet 16 party!!!  it was fun! we hung out, watched movies and swapped stories!! we partied hard, lol!  we had this dancing circle etc and me and mary were trying to teach people how to freak dance....except it wasn't really working lol.  But we will help you!!!  You kids will go clubbing with us when we're 18!!! I got like 5 awesome purses, 2 cool cds, a "hockey" blanket, and some other stuff, it was tizite  and today, i drove to walmart and kohl's by myself......it was jam-packed with action  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
