I read it somewhere that we mostly limit our choices to two and that is why we tend to be sometimes negative in life.If we try to broaden the options into three or four we could be make our life easier for us and for the people we care about.I have a big problem with choices, simply some choices are just not fair. For example if you have two options and both options are just too close to the heart and that is the time when u just hate yourself , cause you just want to delay the choice simply because it is just too hard and too hurtfull.  That is what growing up is all about i think, to enable yourself to make hard choices in life. Sometimes it involves a carrer decision , a marriage decision or a love decision and i can say like a number of more but then the blog would be just too small to fit it in :). I do tend to regret choices, but i know i had made it and that itself is a part of accepting responsibility which is trust me so hard to do.  Experiences is one more part which just makes you a grown up. Will you be a grown up in a bad way or a good way, that itself is a personal CHOICE. Again the debate could be what is bad in my eyes would not be bad in your eyes, it is a matter of perception. Experience in my eyes is the most priceless possesion a man or a woman can have. Thousand book would not teach you what experience would. It is like a simple think you could have read about how work is but you know the meaning of work when you actually do it. I am not implying here that a person should not read, don't take me wrong here. In fact i think being well read is very important as it is impossible to experience everything first hand, but that should not excuse you to know about it and that is why books are such a valuable knowledge that you just cant trade it in with anything.  UK as a country as made me grow up (i dont know abt bad or good). It has given me an oppurtunity to feel diversity first hand, it has made me more tolerant, it has made me more sensitive but yet insensitive if that makes any kind of sense, it has made me appreciate the small and big things in life and most of all it has taught me to be independent (or i may hope so) This country has given me a varierty of experiences both good and bad which i would have not dreamt of even comming close to it in India. One thing whihc i will always thank this country would be that i was introduced to the world of academia from this country which is just so vast and so good .I have just pointed out some experiences, it just given me too much to think about for my whole life. And most of all ithas given me the most beautiful and most dreaded thing in the world. I will keep you guessing.....
