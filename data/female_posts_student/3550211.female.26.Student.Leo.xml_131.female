I know when I wake up in the morning, I have one less thing to worry about, now that I don't have to sit down and eat my yogurt. I can save a precious 5 minutes by taking it on the go.   Yeah  right . I don't think so.   Call me old school, but I don't want to eat my yogurt out of a tube. It's kind of nauseating.  There seems to be a fine line between products that we actually need versus products that are completely useless.
