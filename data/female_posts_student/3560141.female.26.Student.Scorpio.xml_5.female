It started with the Olympus mega outdoor camera with waterproofing and perks galore, well, now I have this Kodak brand camera with barely a megapixel and it holds like ten pics on internal memory, so my adventures through Central Park yesterday would only be captured for the first two hours, because by then the battery died and my camera had stored its last pic...Father's Day went well...odds in my favor...
