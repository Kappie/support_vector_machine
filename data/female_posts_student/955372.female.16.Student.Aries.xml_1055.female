Didn't work so mum drove us. I had to do my language arts homework, otherwise I wouldn't have cared if we missed homeroom. At least I wasn't marked absent. Then I failed the test in math, because I just didn't study. Gym we had to row and my calves were killing me because I never stretch them and they pull EXTREMELY easily, plus my ass got all sweaty from sitting on the stupid rower. Ass sweat is the worst. Both me and Anna forgot about the science project due today. Oh yeah and that Spanish test, definitely spelled like um, everything wrong. Plus I am sick and tired. And today's not even over yet! I have two projects due tomorrow, two tests tomorrow, plus language arts homework. And I'm like falling over tired. Like If I close my eyes for more than 5 seconds I will fall off of this chair in a dead sleep. School is ruining my life.
