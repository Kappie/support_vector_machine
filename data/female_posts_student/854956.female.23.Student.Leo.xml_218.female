Then my Mom got home from church... and we looked at some of the Sunday ads.  Then I called in an order to Grant St. pizza... and picked it up 20 minutes later.  After I had a couple slices (which were absolutely delicious) I watched the Spurs game.  Thank GOD they kicked some ass!  After that, I looked over a few notes for my exam tomorrow.  Then my Mom and I went over to WalMart of FM78 to get some more low car ice cream for my Dad and to look for some medicine that she couldn't find at the Wally World on Austin Hwy.  When we got back home, I watched some more tv... and that brings me to now.  I haven't done a damn thing today!  I mean, I have... but I haven't.  Now I shall go to do MORE of nothing... that is because I have a LOT of time to study tomorrow... :-)  Yay...!
