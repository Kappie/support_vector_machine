These people are so ignorant, I swear! (My phone bill was mailed yesterday to the tune of $528.00). Yeah, right. They charge dme over $350 in roaming charges when I have a national plan.  Morons. Ughhhhh.  Anywhoooooo, I am getting this straightened out now.  It's raining again. Ugh. Suppposed to have bad weather all day and tomorrow here in Houston.  I have my own office and outside my huge window is just a gray mist and wet streets. Nasty for sure. Thank goodness I am on park and ride today so I won't have to face the traffic at 5:30p.m.  I watched part of the movie Big Fish last night. Such a weird flick. I lost interest as 11:00p.m. neared and just went to bed. Maybe I will finish it tonight. Hmm, don't know. I think mother and I are making jello shots tonight for this weekend.   Well, no news here. Lots of love. Hi Paddy.    Don't Forget to Click the link above.
