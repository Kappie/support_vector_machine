We spent the day spending her graduation gift certificuts, visiting office max for moving boxes (we shared our common infatuation with multicolored sharpies) , and playing "old faithful" aka rummey cube. I promised myself I wouldn't cry , and I didn't. It was only when I had to give her one last hug goodbye, that really made me sad I'm not graduating this year with my senior clique.  I got home that afternoon to discover that my mom had deleted my Buddy List. Yes the fabulous Sarah Lee had delelted some  100  screen names. I salvaged what I could remember but I lost majority of my USY regional friends and old home school buddies. That will be a "FUN" project for when school starts, So please e-mail me your SN.  I got the packet of "important" papers for the school year.  I wonder who the new theatre teacher will be and how long he'll last.  The name says H. Connor but that doesn't reveal any detail, like age, ethnicity, or sex.  Oh well, I'll find out soon enough.  My cousin in Florida, Jessica survived the hurricane and the surgery on her overbite.  Though they had 5 days without power, she managed to meet a new guy.  She is truly an insporation.  Hope to have more exciting stories to tell and links up next time.
