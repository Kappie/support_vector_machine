Left at 5:45 AM and got back at 12:30 AM. It was such a long day, but in between Inertia and C-Force we got to hang out in the rooms, so most of us slept. But, we ended up getting last...Keokuk got first, I guess they're good this year (they've always been bad).  Although I only had like 5-6 hours of sleep last night, I'm so wound up right now. It's kind of nice out, a little chilly but sunny, and I really want to do something fun.  2 days of work this week (Tuesday and Sunday). So, Dad...I work Sunday from 3-7 PM but the rest of the weekend I have nothing going on, but I will give you a call today to talk to you.
