I feel great because I got like 12 hours of sleep, but other than that I'm very out of sorts from my usual diva-self.  I also realized I have a HUGE project I have to work on here at my job, but as usual I'm procrastinating.  Somehow I got the brilliant idea to tell the project managers that I could have it done by May 27th.  Way to be, Gwen, way to be.  Acutally its very easy but its more me relying on others to get their information to me which is quite the task.  No one here likes to get anything done on time.  Alas, I sit here blogging to pass my time.    I'm also dreading my trip to the DMV on Thursday night after work.  Those people are a nightmare and I have to try and reactivate plates that were stolen 10 years ago but recovered shortly there after.  They're also vanity plates so it will cost me an arm and a leg to do it, but in the end it will make it much easier to find my car in the parking lot.  Also, I've put off my dieting and excercise until next week.  I'm super PMSy and miserable this week so I've decided to let my hormones be in charge rather than piss myself off any further.    Also, go check out  urlLink Anna's Blog .  She's punk rawk, a super hottie, she's got a "smokin' rack", she organizes B I T C H I N' shows, and just otherwise rules and is one of my bestest girlies.  You will love her, I promise!  That is all for now.  Oh yeah, get well soon, Patches!
