Also, my sister is visiting from Australia, so we spent the first portion of the week cleaning, and we'll be spending the last portion of it entertaining.  By the way, I'm totally in favor of having John Cusack as a co-blogger.  Now, Justin, all you have to do is get him to agree.  And now I'm gonna go add this site as a link on my other blog.    I just have to add, after "Friends" ends this year, NBC is going to have a spin-off about Joey! It'll be interesting to see if it succeeds (like "Frasier") or flops.  I like Joey, so I hope it does well.  How you doin?
