I am going to miss all of my senior friends and everyone that I'm not going to see over the summer. I took some good pictures of everyone today. And we didn't really do anything in any of my classes so that was good. This marking period doesn't look like it's going to be the best for me. I have some really crappy grades (for me).  There was no senior prank this year. How lame is that? I'm already thinking of some goods ones.  Well, tomorrow I might be going to my dad's house. I'm not to sure yet though. Then Thursday and Friday in the morning I have my English regents. But if anyone wants to do anything later in the day then that would be good.   So, I'm alone again. (sad face) I'm alone a lot lately. I hate it so bad. So if anyone wants to just stop by anytime before 10:00 I welcome it.  Sometimes I think I dream to big. Maybe if I didn't want so much or expect the absolute greatest then I wouldn't be crushed so badly.  Listening to: [Violence by Blink 182]  6 bottles went down the drain,  one hours waste of time,  I’d ask if you feel the same,  still pushing that chance to try,  your breath in this cool room chill,  long hair that blows side to side,  you speak and make time stand still,  and each time you walk right on by...  Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after.  Can’t count all the eyes that stare,  can’t count all the things they see,  she kills with no life to spare,  just victims are left to bleed,  one drink and the pain goes down,  soft shadows lay by her feet,  lay soft as you slowly drown,  lay still while you fall asleep. (Fall asleep)  Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after. (And after…and after…and after)  Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me… Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me…  Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after. Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after.  [Lady Voice:]  My dearest  I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together  And will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately I've read you're letter through at least 4 times And will probably read it more times before I'm through I've been sitting here Looking at you're picture and getting more home sick every minute  I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of Except of course you, you're self   I keep thinking of you darling  I keep wishing I could be home with you I want to leave in the worst possible way so I could come home to see you But: Things don't look to good on that subject This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess  I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now   I'm completely lost without you darling   I never realized I could miss anyone person so much  I just hope it won't be too much longer till I'm able to be with you again And live a  sane  and  normal  life.
