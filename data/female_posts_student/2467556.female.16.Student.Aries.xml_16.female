Oh man it was nerve-racking for almost the entire 60 mins.......jeez i almost had a heart attack.  And my Niko played so well!!!!  All the Stars played fabulously!!!  Now if only we can keep this winning up, we'll be out of last place in no time!!!   Oh man after we scored, i almost blew out my speakers by blasting out the "Ole Ole" song.  And then after we won, i played "We are the Champions" really loudly.  It was fun!!  It reminded me of the last World Cup when i did that.  yeah so anyways......i have extreme happinness right now or in other words, i'm high on hockey!!!  lol, almost like when Brittnee is high on her "lariette designer drugs" (LOL Brittnee!!)  Go Stars! Niko Rocks,  ~~~Taylor~~~
