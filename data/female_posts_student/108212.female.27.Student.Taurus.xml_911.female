It's not too busy or anything and since I'm not that good with webgraphics, it looks like it might be easier to achieve. The organization is the harder part. I mean, what type of content management system are they using? They've gotta be using something! It would be a pain in the ass to hand-code all those archives! It looks like Moveable Type to me, but I'm not sure. In the meantime I am kind of stuck. Before the launch, I want to move Golden Sushi to more reliable servers because Fateback is either down or their FTP is inaccessible. Plus you can't run CGI or PHP scripts so it's really not any fun. Right now I cannot access their FTP to move our blog. I've been trying to access it every hour on the hour since yesterday morning -- no luck. Not sure how long this FTP outage will be but thankfully after I access it again it will be for the last time because I'm moving everything!
