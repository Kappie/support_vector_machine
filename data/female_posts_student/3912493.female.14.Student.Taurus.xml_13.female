I mean, every time that Uruguay had the ball and they were going to score, some idiotic Argentina player would run up to him and push him real hard, which, of course, would cause the Uruguay player to lose the ball. Also, the Argentina guy would get a yellow card, but I thought he was supposed to get a red card and get kicked out. This happened a lot of times. Argentina also fakes most of the faults and pretend that an Uruguay player pushed/kicked them. Blasted morons. I was so mad! Then of course, they get a free-kick. Dang it. The bad thing is that Uruguay lost 4-2... they were playing good for just having 10 players on their team. I hope Argentina loses their first match on the second round and get their butts kicked by some kick arse team. I never liked the Argentina soccer team. They're just cheaters and (I'll never stop saying this) play dirty. Curse you!  Blog Spot rocks... I like it because it's more simple and clean. I loathe Xanga, it's too... "fancy." I think it's complicated, too. Plus, I like being the oddball. Almost all of my friends have Xangas, except me: I have Blog Spot. And 96% of my friends have AIM, too, but of course, I don't. I use the best IM there is up to today: MSN. I hate AIM and everything that has to do with gAyOL. It's so low-quality, and AIM is not even near MSN's quality. I mean, AIM's smilies suck, and that annoying sound that it makes when you receive/send a message can't get more annoying. I don't know why my friends use AIM or what they see in it. MSN is so far superior and better. All of the versions that AIM makes are the same, unlike MSN, because they keep adding some cool features to it, like on version 6.0 (I have 6.2 right now, and yes, there is a difference between 6.0, 6.1 and 6.2... go figure) you can add your own customized smilies. Plus, MSN's display pictures are bigger than crappy AIM Buddy Icons, and not to mention that you can change your background picture and background color in MSN. I could go on forever on why MSN is better than gAyOL, but I'll stop here. My goddess... MSN pwns.  There's another reason why I hate gAyOL and AIM, but you can see that by reading Kasuto's editorial about it by click  urlLink here . It explains everything there.  But enough negativity. I think I'm forgetting how to speak Spanish. It sucks. One day my brother and I had forgotten how to say "stage" in Spanish. It was the worst thing ever. Of course, I had to look it up in the dictionary that we have. I don't wanna forget my native language. I told my mom about this and she was so fuggin' upset. Then one day we went to this store and they had newspapers in Spanish. She made me read them out loud, 'cause she thought I had forgotten how to read it. I was nervous because I hadn't read in Spanish in a long time. I messed up two or three times, but I read pretty well. I wasn't even thinking of what I was reading, but I was worried that I'd mess up while reading. Weird. I think my mom is gonna buy me some Spanish books so I can start reading them and so that I don't forget how to speak it, read it, and write it. I hope I buy one soon.
