" you may not understand, why theres a smile on my face, its cause this world could be such, a wonderful place..."   Well, since there ain't shit to do here.. i guess i have to blog. Damn, what really sucks about havin hella boxes around is... when the phone rings and u are the one that has to get it, and youre runnin in the dark and trip over those boxes and break a couple of toes.. just to answer the phone and its your brother askin you to let him in late tonight....  you have no one but to blame but yourself because you know that theres random boxes everywhere... Fuckin boxes.... But damn i have heartburn like a mother!! but damn , those boxes man. So everyones wonderin.. ' hows texas?' well, its... Texas, hot and humid with tons of nasty, never-before-seen bugs , hella mosquitos, and flies , huuuuge ass grasshoppers... i'll have to take a pic of one and put it on here... large jumping turantuals and all kinds of crazy bugs here. what i need is a major tan, haha... cause its hella hot here ! But i havent really done much, just mostly sat around the house.. blah blah blah.. boring. The drive down here was awful i had to ride with my mom, and our truck was trippin , we could barely go over 50 the whole way... And my mom got pulled over for hit  run on a 18 wheela' {  that ho fine but this ho'a killa ..} haha but yeh then we drove thru the  FATTEST  thunderstorm.. like to have killed me haha...but nope, havent done much, a big difference between TX  CA is that hella random family members [ that you dont even know exist] pop up at your house at all hours of the day... its weird... and everyone here is so fuckin nice it drives me nuts... !! i'm goin insaaaaane! but anyways.. i havent talked to markus all day.. i juss dont think he understands... but oh well, hes  a dude... dudes are evil, [ right, mark? ] but anyways i did talk to cristina today.. made me feel hella better... and i talked to stephanie, shes all , i called u at ur old house to see if u wanted to do anything but it said the phone was disconnected and i was like ' that bitch moved!
