OMFG! what the fuck does he think i've been living through for the past 24 years.   he was and still is in total fucking denial about the abuse i had to put up with from her.  and if i try to say something about it, he just goes silent and continues on his thought.   I wish my mother wasn't totally fucking psychotic. i wish my father wasn't in total fucking denial ... i could save my sister from the situation she is in.  i don't want her to be 24 and having the understanding that noone can love her.  that there is something fundamentally wrong with her that makes her unworthy of anyone's affections. i wish i could stop being with joey.   i wish i could trust my own emotions. i feel like i love him, but i can't trust that.  i have no way of knowing if it's real.  and even if i did really love him, he won't love me, so i'm just wasting my energy. i wish i was hot so someone would want me. even though i thoroughly believe that is wrong. i wish i could get affection and touch in some way other than through sex. i wish being alone was good enough for me. i wish i was good enough. i wish  joey wasn't using me for something until... i wish i had not put myself in this situation. i wish i had the self esteem to get out. i wish i thought more of myself, and not to feel that i am totally worthless. i hate saying that i am worthless, i don't think i really am, but i feel that i am.  i hate that joey said "where's my girlfriend" when referring to a hot girl at the movies tonight. i hate when he says "i wouldn't kick her out of bed in the morning" i dont' even spend the night, never mind get to stay in bed in the morning. i hate the way he is about gena. i hate that i know that if i tell him any of this we will be over, or we will continue to be the same i hate that he won't change i hate that i am not good enough for him i hate knowing that he won't change, and yet i continue to be with him i hate wanting to be with him i hate wishing he wanted me i hate allowing myself to think of any future with him i hate the disappointment and hurt i feel when i realize it will never happen, cuz he will never change. i hate that i am not good enough for him to change. i hate that he can't love me. i hate that he can't kiss me, or be affectionate in public i hate that he drinks i hate that he smokes i hate that i should be a mother right now, and i'm not i hate that i still want to be a mother i hate that i have to convince myself to take my bc pill everyday i hate that i won't go to the gym and watch what i eat i hate that i have such a hard time dealing with life life that seems so easy to so many others i hate that i can't see life ever being better.
