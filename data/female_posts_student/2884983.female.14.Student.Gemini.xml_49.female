And to top it all of Gaia isnt working. but I got new clothes. so it is ok. :) me and krys helped mom out with the free store at the church and we picked out some clothes that we like. anyways....I have the most boring life right now. well...no I really do. I had alot of fun on Gaia though last night. I talk about Gaia far too much. It is like my obsession. ......Bija tea is really good. It helps with the sickness thing. it helps bring the constant headache to a really low throbbing. But I bet by now I would be able to handle a full blown out headache. a headache mind you not a migraine cause I really cant deal with the ones I get...................................................................................yes..I have offically run out of things to type. it is st. Patricks day today. I am actually wearing some green! this is the first time in years I have aactually remembered..well actually it wasnt me that remembered it was my mom and she told us. I have my neon green socks and my green earrings and I drew a vine along my hand in green. so I am all set. *nods*  yes  Iam aware that I am rambling on about nothing but I think I am actually quite good at it :)..oh I got these boots at the free store that are insane! they go up half of the calf and have these really skinny heels. and the toe is pointed..oh and they are black of course. The book i am reading right now is really good!! I really love it. I am on the second book in the series and am enjoying it very muchly. lol no I dont think muchly is a word. but it my little world it is. *more agreeable nodding* i like making up my own words, I am very bad at speaking fast without totally messing up all of my words. most of my friends understand what I am saying..although it is the same when I type but luckily they understand that too. :) anyways...I am going to go try gaia again.
