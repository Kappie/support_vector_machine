I'm gonna be smelling my shirt all day!  eep.  well, I can't wear it tomorrow cuz I have two somewhat major tests...  my day in a nutshell:  got to school, jackie gave me insanely pink insanely cute pillow.  =D  then I studied like crazy for bio quiz.  cuz I missed a day.  whoo.  then I went to locker, and on the way to orchestra, gracey apprehended me and gave me a tiger bobble head!  it's so cute.  =D  then orchestra.  scale test.  two octave F major.  cuz everyone else peeked into the hat and took the B flat majors.  skew them.  even deanna peeked!  I'm the only honest one there.  ;)  then bio.  lisa and charles... man.  in the middle of mrs kite's lecture, they start whispering madly and giggling.  then they turn to look at me and giggle some more.  I'm like o__O;; and they giggle some more.  then lisa says, "charles just told me that if you and jack get married, you'd be sunshine sun!"  and I think, "holy crap.  what the heck?"  and then lisa says, "I'm gonna tell jack about this!" and I think, "he already knows... -__-"  maaaaan.  that's disturbing.  then art!  we worked on our armatures.  I'm doing a geisha!  hehe.  but she's turning out... blobby.  haha.  it's disturbing doing this project cuz we hafta make the people, you know, so it's like... we shape their heads and upper torso all out of newspaper.  so when you're doing a girl and you're shaping the breasts... it's... disturbing.  cuz then if they don't look right, you have to tweak them around and then you have to mold them to get them to look not-so-spherical and more conish... man.  it was a disturbing art period.  then french.  who ever does anything in french? I just sat there and doodled and talked more to lisa.  and stacey.  and then I just sat and stared some more.  haha.  what fun.  now I gotta go study for algebra and humanities.  and read ge.  and copy some notes for jack.
