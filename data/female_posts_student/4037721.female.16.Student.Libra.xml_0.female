And I also found a computer in the reception of the Verdemar Apartmentos (It was one euro for ten minuites) so I went on there to check e-mails etc and ended up having a short conversation with Helen about where we were staying.  Oh the other BIG thing that happened that day was that on the way home Dad and Stuart wanted to goto the electronics shop so Dad could get a new digital camera so Me and Mum went home before them. On the way back I told her I had something to tell her that came up the night that we stayed up late. When we got back I told her all about how I felt and that I was questioning my sexuality two years ago and now I feel that I also like women as well as women. She was totally cool with it, and admited that she also had a couple of crushes on girls when she was my age, but she is a bit in deniyal as she said that it may pass when I get older etc. She also advised that I dont tell Dad until I am really sure (WHICH I AM) because she doesn't know how he would react. But I plan on telling him soon anyway because I dont want to hide who I am and pretend to be something I'm not. Thats about it for day four!
