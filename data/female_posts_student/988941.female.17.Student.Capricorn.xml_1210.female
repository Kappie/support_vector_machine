Nuria, Alcalá de Henares, Madrid, Spain   I would like to send my condolences to all family's victims. I'll pray for them tonight. God bless them.  Ítalo Cavalcanti, Fortaleza, Brazil   I can't believe it! All this horror! For what? When will it end?  Jonathon Tong, Madrid, Spain   Has anyone realised that the bomb blast in Madrid was on the 11th March, six months from 11th September. Is it coincidence, or perhaps a deliberate plan on the part of the terrorists?  Julie Oswald, Northumberland   As a person who grew up and lives in NYC, I wanted to let the people of Madrid, Spain to know that our prayers are with them.  Dennis Lee, New York, USA   My son age 16 called from Alcala De Henares to say he was ok. He is on a trip with 7 other students studying at the international school there for 2 weeks from Texas. Our small town in Texas sends our sympathy and our prayers for all the people and country of Spain. My son said it is a horrible tragedy like our 9/11 was to our country. We may be from different countries but we are all family created by our father. We are mourning now with you Spain.   Lynda Pohl, Belton, Texas U.S.A.   We just want peace and justice.  Diego, Madrid, Spain    urlLink Read more
