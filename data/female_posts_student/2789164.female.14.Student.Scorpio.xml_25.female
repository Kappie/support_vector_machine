When we got to school we were sent to the boarding houses. When we were all there the headmistress of our school, Mrs Leggate, told us that our school was going to make a new drama department but to do this they had to close one of the boarding houses, and they had chosen my house, Ivydene, to close. They are going to do this at the end of the summer term - three weeks time. :(  They are going to sell the house then - it will probably be demolished cos is has asbestos in the walls. Sniffle.   Anyway - the only thing good today was that i got 97% in music - top marks in music for the year of 50 people! :D - suppose that made me a little happier!  Anyway need to go and practice my clarinet.  ttyl hedge
