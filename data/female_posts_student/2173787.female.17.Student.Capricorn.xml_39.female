"The remaining operations are coming, God willing, and by God, Jews around the world will regret that their ancestors even thought about occupying the land of Muslims," the statement from the Brigades group said.   "We tell the criminal Bush and his Arab and Western tails - especially Britain, Italy, Australia and Japan - that cars of death will not stop at Baghdad, Riyadh, Istanbul, Nasiriyah, Jakarta, etc, until you see them with your own eyes in the middle of the capital of this era's tyrant, America."    urlLink http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=3534688=news=world
