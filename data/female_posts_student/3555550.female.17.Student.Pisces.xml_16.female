On Thursday, my second cousin Jesse Greise went Kayaking on the Papillion creek. It had rained 3 inches the night before, so the falls were worse than usual. They pulled in his kayak and him as well. His body was recovered Friday night.  Funny how when I returned home, my parents conviently forgot to tell me that he was dead. In fact, I found out 10 minutes before we left to attend his wake. I didn't know him that well- I only saw him at his graduation 3 years ago, and the graduation of his brother this year. I played with his sister a few times when I was a kid, but we were never close. In reality, I shouldn't be so upset. But I am. Just attending the wake got me all frazzled. Hell, I just saw this family about 2 months ago. They were celebrating Tony's graduation with yet another hog roast. I met Shane and Steven again (even though they didn't remember me...haha) and I talked to Cindy (his mom) who is always so so sweet. I ate the cake, I bitched about being there, and then I met the graduate for two seconds and went home. Woopie. Funny how God works. Had I known that Jesse would be laid to rest only a few months after, I may have been less eager to leave.   So, while I was at Triennium, praying to God to bring me someone to love, a mother was losing her child. A young woman was losing her fiancee. A girl was losing her brother.  To hundreds of people... a best friend was lost.   To be in that church last night and see all the people who loved this kid, I guess I realized how cool he must've been. I hope my church is as packed when I die someday. At least you can see the good in that.   So, if you are from Omaha, you may have heard of this young man, a junior (to be senior) at UNO, a graduate of Skutt High School, and State wrestling champ.  Please keep his family in your prayers. Don't pray for me -please. Pray for his mother and father, his 3 brothers and 1 sister, and his fiancee that he left behind.  P.S. My car broke down. Today sucks.
