Today was mostly awesomenessitissity simply because I received my all state score: I made a 100 (on a percent system, indeed!)!!! I was so ecstatic, and still am pretty darn satisfied. Joel and I were the two 100's from our school. Wee!!! ^.^    Otherwise, I'm downright exhausted. I hardly have any time to live these days, and it's rather frustrating. SAT this Saturday= poop= do miserably= retake in June, definitely. Yeah. Okay. I'm about to zonk out, though, so I guess I should call it shower time and then crash indefinitely time (well, hopefully I'll scoowample to climb out of bed by 7.15-ish?)  And on that note, zzz...   *No lyrics today because I'm literally about to pass out... literally.*
