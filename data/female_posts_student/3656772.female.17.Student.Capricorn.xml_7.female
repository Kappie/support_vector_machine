Started hummin' a song from nineteen sixty two      Ain't it funny how the night moves      When you just don't seem to have as much to lose.      Strange how the night moves      With autumn closin in...  School's coming to an end. Finally. It has tried to eat me alive this year. Sometimes I think it actually did, and I'm just a faint memory in another surviver's hysterical nightmare.   Yeah, I'm one of those girls who lose themselves in their memories....but I'm not one of the ones who dwell on things long past...I dwell on the here and now...which isn't any better.   It's the fires that burn in our hearts when we're young that cause us so much anguish. We want to become so much, we want to succede, we want to live up to expectations, we want to be unique, we want to be ourselves, we want to be so much...too much...it isn't who we are, it's who we aren't.   There are lessons we learn in life, and we don't always learn them the first time. Sometimes it takes making the mistake a third time...sometimes it takes ten times, and sometimes it takes being assulted to get it into your fucked up head that there are some people you just shouldn't god damned trust. There are some people whose motives you can never really know. Those who keep betraying your forgiveness...the ones who take your power away.  There is so much good in this world, like friends who listen, friends who care, who love, who won't let you keep blaming yourself, who hold your hand with that angry fire in their eyes, that fire you used to have... and yet no matter where you look, it just doesn't seem to want to be found.  3:00 Monday morning, I woke up feeling so alone I might have screamed and not heard a response, 4:00 Tuesday morning, I woke up crying, and I couldn'tremember why... 2:45 Wednesday morning, I woke up shaking, I had been running from something, 3:25 Thursday morning, I woke up with a migraine-level  headache, 4:15 Friday morning, I woke up aching everywhere, mostly in the places drugs can't reach to deaden, 3:55 ~ Last night I woke up shivering, I was cold in a 70 degree room. It's rather like being alone in a room full of people.   It's been a great week for full nights rest...*rolls her eyes* I don't want to be here, all I want is distraction, something to take my mind away. It's people like me who should be being offered drugs, the half dead are likely to take anything. But no, of course not. I'm too good for that, right? That's what they keep telling me, but since when? I used to be too good for that, but now? What am I now? When did I show resolve? Don't I have any willpower anymore? Where does your honor go when you lose it? Does it melt away into the afternoon sun? Or does it just hide beneath the covers, trembling for fear of the monster it sees when it pulls down the sheets?  And when you look in the mirror, you see all you wish you weren't, but have no idea how to change. It's society that's distroyed who you were, when you were young your fire burned so hot you were like to outshine the sun. But you grew up, and so many things happen...and when you think you are the most weak, thats when the fire startes to flicker, and fade. You look at everyone else, and there in the smiling faces you start to see the mask. You always knew it was there, but when it becomes visible...you begin to understand why children hide underneath their covers. There _are_ monsters in this world, my child, but take care, they are all around you; take care that you do not become one yourself. Fire is what they feed on, and only you can fight them.  But I have a question for you all, when is it too late to fight them away? When they're in your heart, or in you're soul?   Ain't it funny how the night moves      When you just don't seem to have as much to lose.  Yeah, hillarious. I dont seem to have as much to lose anymore, and that's the sad thing.  Of the things they tell me are important, I've got my virginity (oh good...Im so fucking happy about that one), I've got my family, and my friends. Can you lose yourself? I have no doubt. Question is, where do you find you again? If you could get away, where would you hide? Hate to say it, but if I could, I'd hide in someone's arms. Haven't I learned that's just a tad bit dangrous? Heh, but since when has learning something's wrong stopped me? If you like someone, and you've got no problems with being with them, why not, eh? Psh...yeah, really. Why.       So I know what I need, I think. I need a safe place to heal. I reread my entries and I'm obviously not in a good environment these days, to put it lightly. 'When I was young, I thought that I could fly, I believed what I hoped for, I had wings and dreams could soar, I just don't feel like flying anymore...' I want to fly higher, but how do I when I haven't got wings, a wind, a sky, or even a ground. So where do I find this safe place? Psh, I bet it doesn't exist. It's inside of me, like so many things these days. The thing that needs healing is inside my head, so that's probably where I'll find the cure? Right? Sure, if there is a 'cure'.  'You can't run, so you might as well hide... Open up, we're coming inside,  What's it feel like to know you're going to die?  So they took me down to the gallows, And this boy he say to me,   Why do you smile when the rope's around your neck? I said I tell you boy when I get back...  I, I, I ain't opposed to seeking justice,  but you're going about it all wrong, the man you're looking for does not exist, he's just a figment of the higher man's tounge...  How are we to know that your not a liar? Don't you see we have a job to do? And our job is the law You fit the description of a criminal crosser We believe that he is you and that is your flaw that is your flaw... that is your flaw...'
