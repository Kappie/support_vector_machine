I don't think I'm falling for him, but I do think i'm "falling into his trap".  I find myself actually believing the things he tells me.  And he makes me feel good about myself. I like the things he says about me.  I like how we are alike in the smallest ways.  I like how he holds me.  I like how he introduces me to his friends and takes pride in me. I like how we can talk on the phone for hours at a time.  That makes me sick that I like all these things. I'm not like that!  I don't want that to be me.  I don't want to be that girl that needs attention from guys just so she can feel good about herself. Maybe I don't like him.  Maybe i just like the attention i'm getting from him.  I don't know what is wrong with me.  I wish I could just brush him off and treat him like all the other guys.  All the meaningless nothings i've had with different guys that don't mean anything to me.  It doesn't bother me that he can't give me a relationship(we won't get into that), it's kind of a relief that he doesn't want a relationship. Hell, all i want is fun. I'm seventeen, i need to live life.  I don't want to stay tied down to one guy. But sometimes i feel like i'm competing for time with him with the other girl... THe girl that's been in his life for a year and a half. Yeah. talk about drama.  DAMN! I really do think that i only like the fact that he likes me.  i don't know if I like him. I feel bad leading him on...but i want to have fun.  There's nothing wrong with having fun. I dunno, maybe he won't call ever again and i won't have to deal with him. Isn't that awful? Why do i think such things? But it's so true...if he doesn't call, then i don't have to deal with all the shit and i can get over it and move on. LIke i've done all my life...the story of my life. BAh i don't knwo what to do. SOmetimes i wish i had someone who could make all my decisions for me and tell me what to do so i wouldn't have to stress over shit. Well, actually, no i wouldn't want that. That would really suck.  Well i'm off. Night.
