(Naia goes home, drops off her bookbag and gym clothes in her room, gets situated and picks up the phone to call Brandi because she wants to talk.)   Brandi :  Hello?  Naia :  Brandi?  Brandi :  Uh-huh...  Naia :  Hey... what's wrong?  Brandi :  I was sleeping...  Naia :  Oh... you want me to hang up so you can go back to sleep?  Brandi :  Please...  Naia :  Okay, bye...  Brandi :  Bye...  So I end up with no one to talk to (I didn't feel like calling Tanya, there'd be no real convo, and Laura would end up bored..) so I decided to change my clothes, lay down, and watch some good ol' television before I went to do my homework... I ended up falling asleep at 6 pm, waking up at 7, scaring the cahoots outta my dad, going BACK to sleep, and not waking up until  MIDNIGHT . Oh, yeah, I know how to party, alright....  SIKE !  When I got up at 12 am, I realized that I STILL hadn't done my math homework, so I had to go take a shower, do my homework ( you can't make up math HW in my school...),  get something to eat ( I slept through dinner and I don't usually eat lunch OR breakfast, so my stomach was empty the ENTIRE day except for some juice I had drank ), then go back to sleep, which was hard because I had fricking  CRAMPS !!! Ugh... librarian's kicking me out...   Be Back Later....
