There's nothing to really look forward to, no hope for a future worth waiting for. I'm sick of waiting around, I'm sick of being stuck here. Nobody really gives a shit so why should I? Don't toy with me, just let me stay by the banks of a river that never dries up and never stops flowing. A babbling brook that I can just float away in without worrying about the next period of rain or the next tidal wave coming to gobble me up. If you're going to leave me, just do it, because even I can't stop the tears from falling and the last thing I want you to see is me crying. I'm lonely and I'm depressed. What's new? What's worth noting? I slash up my arms to make myself feel better, I hurt myself instead of hurting others. I see my problem, I see the solution, but what I don't see is the effort to get there. I'm impatient with the world and if it can't keep up I won't mind leaving it behind me. The need to get out of this place that always rains is getting stronger. So I'll just keep those in my heart inside a metal photo frame and one day head out and forget about everything that makes me feel safe. It's time to live a little and I'm sick of waiting.
