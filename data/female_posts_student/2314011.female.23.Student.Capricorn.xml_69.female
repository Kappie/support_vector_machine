That Sunday night (for our present purposes, the role of "Monday" will be played by "Sunday") reminder that tomorrow brings with it not only another day, but another week.  Realize now it was really my subconscious, fighting like hell against the end.  Knowing every page turned is bringing me closer to the last place I want to be.  Finishing a favorite book is always hard, but this...I started missing this book on page 80.  Now I'm on 510; can't move forward but can't let it go, either.  Thank god Susan called.  Otherwise I'd be done by now.  But no; I have 30 pages yet!  Yay!
