"...you with that?"  HAR??? What the...  I didn't get the first part but it was actually "can I help you with that?"  Embarassed, I polietly declined his offer... and was about to walk on when he said the  3 uber-magic words  (NOT I LOVE YOU!! Silly...) it was,  "No, I insist...  just to the bus stop if that's where you're going..." i almost died on the spot! what's a girl to do when such an irresistable offer comes along?   ah well... if only every guy was like that! no in fact... if only my boyfriend was like that! he's that kinda guy who will never say "no, i insist..." but life's like that... you just have to suck it up!  i'm going out now to frostbites to meet jimmy, haven't seen him in ages. my boyfriend's gonna play pool so i guess we won't be meeting tonight... then again, he's staying over. well, if i'm lucky, he might not call me a f**king idiot again before we retire for the night...   0 kissies for my baby... not tonight hon, i've got a FUCKING HEADACHE brought on by hmmmm I don't know what!
