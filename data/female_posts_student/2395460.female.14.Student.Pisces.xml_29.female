I think even Jim will be tempted by the  urlLink Mathmos Space Projector , which projects shapes and colors from individual gels onto walls like a ginormous kaleidoscope. And the images look disturbingly like freakishly mutated red blood cells!    Hmmm, maybe he'd like  urlLink Aduki Lamps  better. After being charged, you disconnect the cord and the lamps will slowly fade through a spectrum of four colors over a course of five hours.     How much fun would Jim have playing with these   urlLink Flip and Faze Lights ? Flip over the light in any direction and it will fade through a series of nine colors. Non-toxic to boot!  Jim and anyone else can order the Mathmos lamps at   urlLink ZIPPERgifts .
