Cloudy days are usually a plus, but when you're stuck inside plowing through a mountain of homework, it's not going to make you feel any better.  Assignments over the weekend:  TERM PAPER. Haha, I screwed up so much on this thing already that I don't ever want to see it again. Freeman has gone through with green marker and put comments, and her last one just made me think, ugh, I'm so done with this.  MINK. Stupid minkie. On Monday we get to see a video of mink parts and write down the name of the muscle, the origin and the insertion and the action...for about 40 parts? 50? I have this fear that it's not going to stick. MATH PROJECT. Award-winning or not, I still think it's unbelievably tedious--why do we have to create some fake resume for a mathematician who might be already dead?  BAILEY TEST. If you ask me, I think Ballard's class is the least substantial of any I've ever had, with the exception of Aca Deca, probably. How can you take a class seriously when the teacher's tangents are planned?   Agh, so that's it, I hope. I have Excelsior practice this afternoon. God knows that Charle. isn't going to turn up much in terms of where we're going. Ryan's going to grumble that horn doesn't do C major. Heather is going to remind us that she has to leave early for a party. Andrew wants to see my room, which makes me squirm...does he not remind you of a freshman demeanor-wise? And I have to pick up Mark, who literally lives two minutes away from me. I can totally see it as being another practice where we get off on some exciting conversational topic and don't play for a good twenty minutes in between.   And the most disappointing fact is that I'm probably the only one who cares about this thing. Charle. won't even talk to me now because she hasn't taken care of her part; Ryan's never liked this in the first place and I'm surprised he hasn't thrown in his towel, and Heather is questionable. I'll leave it at that.   Eh, I've changed my mind. I'm not letting anyone read the birthday journal, let alone Ryan. I can imagine him going through it and making faces and thinking of me as a greater retard than he already thinks I am. And I've stopped making a habit of ripping the calendar pages off. It doesn't mean that much to me anymore. He doesn't mean that much to me. I mean, I've forgotten what it feels like to tingle when you know someone's thinking of you.   And maybe physical attraction is overrated.   Scott's out at a hooooliday parade today--with a girl. I can't explain why I'm so happy for him. It's so refreshing to see him fret over a girl...and it's so cute. Although according to instincts I really don't believe that he hasn't been into this before, but I'll let him say whatever.   I have $90 that's mine, all mine. From tutoring. Except I know I have to get bday presents for Jess and Anna and then Christmas presents for mom and dad and grandma and Pug, but I really don't fee like it because I want to hoard all the money I earn and blow it off on something ridiculous. Like a shopping spree on Third St. Damn it. I hate Christmas presents between friends. I guess I'm obligated to give something back, but even if I spend $5 per person that amounts to what? $40? Less, I hope? I just don't want to get little stupid presents for people that probably won't mean anything.  Things I want for Christmas: the stupid and the practical *to spend next summer at Harvard (or Stanford) *to be able to go through two weeks of nothingness without going crazy *money...I've only realized recently what a money hog I am *CDs, or an MP3 player *more independence *to stop associating with people who aren't worth associating with  And that's it. I'm out of brain juice.
