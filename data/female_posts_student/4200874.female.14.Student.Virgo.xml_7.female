He's great actually. We're actually doing work, and I'm pretty sure I'm heading somewhere. I actually comprende.       We had to design our T-shirt today during CE period, according to careers we think we will be in, 10 years in the future. I chose a career in the film industry, as a Director! Yeah right!! As if I'd actually stand a chance. I wouldn't mind it, just that it isn't my top priority, although I must admit, I had considered it seriously at one point in my life. Then again, I had considered evrything from a doctor, lawyer, teacher, psychologist, psychiatrist, CIA/FBI agent, astronaut and now, a director. Boy oh boy... I'm pretty sure I left out a couple.       Anyhow, not too sure what exactly I plan to do with my t-shirt. Tough job it is as a fashion designer... That's DEFINITELY something I will NOT consider. Nuh uh... NOT for me!       And our fieldtrip to Kampung Glam/Sultan Mosque was a bore! Although I must say I certainly did learn some. But, still boring. Too dry. And all we did was visit Masjid Sultan, no Glam. It was closed for rebuilding.       Oh, and Aisha and I went from the mosque, to glam, and back to the mosque, because 3Z left without us and we thought they were there, when all along they were freakin next to the mosque, in the auditorium!! Silly much.       Egg  Hairin didn't come... so no toblerone!! ;( Tommorrow hopefully.       Anyhow, off to look for inspiration for my t-shirt.       -Peace Out-       I'm never gonna dance again     Guilty feet have got no rhythm     Though it's easy to pretend     I know you're not a fool     I should have known better than to cheat a friend     And waste a chance that i've been given     So i'm never gonna dance again     The way i danced with you
