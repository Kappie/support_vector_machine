God brought me to mychal for 6 months and that was just great. He highered my self-esteem so much and treated me so well... Then there's maria...this summer we have gotten so close and she is soo awesome and we are like joined at the hip and like I could never get sick of her...I love her she's my best friend! Matt...he's been so cool and like I duuno it's awesome to have someone who actually calls me to do stuff rather than me calling him...he's a very sweet and caring guy and one of my best friends..he's also a great listener and good at giving advice...and I like tacos more than him lol...but I love that kid! I duuno right now I just feel so lost in myself..like I'm not sure who to be or who   ...I'm really nervous about the new school ~I just want people to like me and accept~it'd be way cool to be popular and bring everyone to church..thats my goal! lol but I duuno I'm just worried that I'll be a loser again like I am at p-burg ~I'm so sick of being teased and bullied...I just don't know whats wrong with me like why people like to make fun of me,,,am I too fat?ugly?loud?annoying? I duuno whats wrong with me..I just wish I knew what it was..  ya know what I hate~I hate it when you like someone so much but you're good friends with that person so you're afraid to tell them cuz you don't want it to ruin the friendship..I wanna tell him so bad but I'm so scared of what he'll say and I'm scared of rejection...I just wanna be his girl but I duuno he's just so much fun to hang out with and seems like he'd be such an awesome boyfriend but I guess we'll just be friends which is cool but it's hard to have a crush on you're friend and not want to be more...everytime I look into his eyes I just wanna tell him but I can't and I duuno when I'm with him it just feels so right...*sigh*  well my parents are out tonight and I'm home alone...*yawns*well I'm sleepy so I'm gonna go now...
