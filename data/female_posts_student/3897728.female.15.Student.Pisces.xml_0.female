I browsed through my whole list of no. and couldn't find someone to talk to.... "Hello, is ??? there? no? ok thanks..." most of them are not at home..... Finally, i decided to call Dianne... We talked, and shared... She shared with me her experiences... I din noe she went thru so much things which i am going thru now... Learnt so much frm her... Felt God talking to me thru this sister... He reminded me tht i need to get back to Him... I was so sorry, i knelt and prayed... He dried my tears and renewed my heart... He give me strength again!!! I love Him... Because He first loves me... who cares if i dun have a boyfriend to love me? who cares if i am going to be a nun nxt time? As long as i have God it is ok... He provides me with wad is best for me... And I will trust in Him... Even during times when i feel down... LOVE HIM SO much!!!!!!!!!!!!!  "The Lord is my strength and my shield; in Him my heart trusts, and I am helped; my heart exults, and with my song i give thanks to HIM." Psalms 28:7
