I mean they were fine the night before, then he comes up to her before 3rd period and says he doesn't feel the same anymore and broke up. Yeah because he likes a freakin slut. If he seriously knew how he made Embry feel he wouldn't of been such a jackass. Was he there when Embry found out the real reason and started crying? Did he comfort her? No, me, Kiera, and Danielle did. So techinally fuck him, he's not worth it. I hate it when guys do that, even though I can't relate, never being dumped for someone else. I've really only been dumped one time, and that was more on a mutual aspect and the other times I just broke up with them. Or I just I said no when I got asked out, lol yeah it's not that I didn't want a relationship, it was the guys.   But I've found a really great one now and I wouldn't give him up for anything in the world! I'm really happy I have him because he's better than most of the guys and I know that probably every girlfriend says this about their boyfriend, but with mine it's true, I never have to worry about any of this, and that's a great feeling :)  So in highlight of the night, we had a girls nite out! Went to CiCi's pizza, then we got some Ben and Jerry's Karamel Sutra and Haagen Daas Coffee ice cream, and a bag of big jet-puffed marshmellows, chips, salsa, and cokes, and drowned Embry's sorrow's in food and watched Office Space. Lol we had a camp fire with a freaking huge candle in the middle of the game room and roasted marshmellows, mmmm they were good. With my caramel ice cream that had a pure caramel core! woo! Yeah I'm so not eating for a week (sarcasm) lol maybe just for the weekend or something, because seriously I feel like throwing up, ahhh it's cool, IT WAS ALL WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!! BECAUSE IT WAS GOOD!! MMM Caramel and MARSHMELLOWS!!! And that was my night! Yay! "Dude I'm going show her my O face, O O O O" haha good stuff!    There has been no one brighter than you I can't deny these things that I do Feels like the world's at stake 'cause I have been waiting I have been waiting for you
