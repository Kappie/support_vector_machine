I haven't asked Kim, but I think I know her list: Phil Collins Kenny Rogers ( ewww!!! ) Pierce Brosnan Dylan McDermott Patrick Stewart  Chloe (from  Angel , right?) IS pretty hot.  And I used to like Jeri Ryan, until  Boston Public .  Musta been her space suit.  Ot maybe that Borg thing on her face.    WAY back in the day (before any of you were born, except Josephine), it was Sally Struthers - I Think I've mentioned  Five Easy Pieces  before?  Anyhow, it was all over by the time  All in the Family  came on.  I'm so fickle.
