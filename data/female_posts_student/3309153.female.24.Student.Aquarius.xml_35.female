The criteria they use/answer choices provided are often so leading (disgustingly, obviously leading)...too simple-minded...too cutesy...too stretchy...whatever they are, its all very distasteful to me. Just as they should be. I mean, people do create them just for fun and neatness. I know they aren't intended to be scientific...but just the same, I'm not usually a fan even though I know I shouldn't  hate on them  or their creators or those addicted to them. And I could lie and say that I don't. But why. However,  urlLink this quiz  looked like an interesting one...well-written questions, compared to others of its ilk. I recommend it. I liked its results. Can't argue with Kant. Well, you could. But I won't. Because I don't know as much as I should to really be able to tell if I should sit well with this conclusion or no. But...at this moment/this stage of my Kantian education, I am but content.  My results:  1. Kant (100%) 2. Jean-Paul Sartre (75%) 3. Stoics (73%) 4. John Stuart Mill (68%) 5. Ayn Rand (66%) 6. Spinoza (56%) 7. Aquinas (52%) 8. Jeremy Bentham (51%) 9. Epicureans (46%) 10. Nietzsche (42%) 11. St. Augustine (38%) 12. Prescriptivism (37%) 13. David Hume (36%) 14. Plato (32%) 15. Ockham (30%) 16. Aristotle (30%) 17. Cynics (24%) 18. Thomas Hobbes (21%) 19. Nel Noddings (17%)  And thank God there doesn't seem to be any distinctly  urlLink Hegel  in me! If he be in you, gentle quiz-takers...beware! Get thee to the nearest exorcist! Banish him. And certainly don't tell anyone.  This quiz, though, will have me researching the fellows I have yet to become acquainted with. I want to know "their influence" if it is here.  If you take the quiz...share your philosophical  match  with us.
