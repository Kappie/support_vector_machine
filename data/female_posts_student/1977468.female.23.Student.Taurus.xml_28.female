The scripting was like aimed at 4 year olds or something, the animation was very very very choppy, and the scripting... I don't think I mentioned that it just sucked... it was almost bad scripting satire, it was that bad.   **Girl G.I Joe punches undercover enemy staff on a dinner boat**  Guy GI Joe: Haha, nice one.  Girl GI Joe: THanks, oh... hows my hair?  Guy GI Joe: Even Cobra couldn't make you look bad.  Girl GI Joe: *chuckle* Turn off the charm, you might attract whales.   WHALES!!?!?!?!? FRICKEN WHALES?!?!?!? What does that have to do with *ANYTHING*!?   *Cobra sees his staff defeated back at base through ominous nonexistant video survailence hovering somewhere overhead*  Cobra: I have morons on my payroll!! (in scratchy evil voice)  *Meanwhile the richest batchler in the world is being wooed by his suitors*  Suitor: Me and your fortune were meant to be!    I'm going to watch it every night now.. its on Adult swim.  I'm so dirty from working today I might sleep ontop of the sheets. I take showers in the mornings now to wake up, even though otherwise its not logical.   Uhh... and now a random quote from Eric.   "But seriously, I'd be lucky to find a girl who enjoys being around me as much as I do."
