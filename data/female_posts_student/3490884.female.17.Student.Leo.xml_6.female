I literally haven't stopped smiling since I got home from the Bio Final. I don't even care how I did on that. I'm floating on a major high.   I feel totally deserving of the title of Senior now. We made it through an insane schedule of tests, quizzes, papers, pop quizzes, writing assignments, homework, and just everything College Board could throw at us all at once. We made it through AP French V and crazy Alma, AP English and anal Beaumont, AP US History and liberal, black power advocate Z, AP Biology and class wars and evil tests, Honors Math Analysis and hilarious Morris with her annoying mini quizzes. Why couldn't she just call them pop quizzes, lol? That always bugged me. Oh my gosh. So many memories from this crazy year. It's been such a wild ride. Drama, friends, unforgettable times, lunch jokes, morning fights, great weekends...And now it's all over.   That's good and bad I guess, but I'm not gonna get all nostalgic and start into a refrain from "Memories." I'm too happy for that.   I feel like a huge weight has been lifted and I can finally breathe. Maybe that's why everyone thought I was unhappy this year...because I was too busy to feel happiness. I needed to focus, but now I'm done and I couldn't be happier. I definitely feel happiness now, so don't be surprised if I smile a LOT more. Believe me, I've tried to stop smiling, but it's not working. I feel like I'm feeling all the happiness from the year that's been stored up and is exploding now. Haha. YES! OMG! This is amazing. I don't think I've ever felt this this...I have no words...it's ineffable.   I could go on forever about how elated I am, but I'd rather go do something more productive. Just one more...OMG! I'm so HAPPY! LoL. Okay, now I'm done.  NBTHS Class of 05!!!
