The crowd was not as good, and as we were walking there, Mike called and said that his friends weren't interested in going into the Dot again afterall.  Boo... but still ok.  I had waaaay too much to drink, even though I swore moderation to myself.  C'est la vie.  And Anil showed up near the end of the night, bought us tequila shooters, and it wasn't long after that I was sick, sick, sick as a dog!  Ralph!  But not too sick to go out on my big date with Tom (Delong, as Ky calls him.)  I called him Saturday afternoon... "So what do you want do to?"  He asks me. "Uh... Whatever it ends up being, it'll have to be a gentle kind of night.  I had a rough night of drinkin' last night, and I'm feeling kinda like ass."  Scoring a laugh is always a good sign.  He told me he had had a similar night on Friday, so also wanted to do something laid back. "How about we grab a bite to eat, then maybe watch a flick?" "Sounds really good, Tom!"  Really good.  Brent called me at work on Friday afternoon.  He had plans to meet some people and just didn't want to wait around, so he said he'd drop the box off on Saturday.  Of course, when Saturday came, I was not at home.  In fact, far from it: after Anil showed up at our table at the Maddy, a tray of tequila in hand, I ended up crashing (and puking) at his house on Saturday afternoon.  I actually called Brent from there to say that I wouldn't be at home, so maybe I could come by his place and pick it up myself sometime?  No, he said, he'd rather just drop it off.  Hmm, ok, well I'd try to be back home in time, but if not... well whatev.  When I finally got home at about 7, Mom said that Brent had been by at about 5.  He left some stuff.  I asked how he was, did he look ok?  did he ask about me?  what did they talk about?  But she gave me nothing!  Said that it was none of my business...?  Uh, what?  It sorta hit me with a nasty little pang that he had been that close,  in my house , and I didn't get to see him.  Mom was like: "He has a cellphone all of a sudden. What's up with that?" Jeez Mom, he's going out on his own, with friends I dunno, meeting people and probably wanting to keep in touch with them. He's not dating me anymore, so he's got time for, like, a jillion other people. Whadja expect, Ma? Every now and then, I get these little pangs of panic... but I keep asking myself, if he showed up right now, saying he wanted to get back together, would I??? Nope, I wouldn't. So I guess that should really allay all my panic.   Hmm... enough of this.  On to the date.  Date went very, very, VERY well! Hmm... is that maybe a little over-eager?  Tom took me out to the Rude Native (a fairly nice restaurant, rei good eats.)  Conversation was great!  Hardly a moment of silence between us.  We talked so much, the waiter had to come back twice to take our orders!  Hee hee!  He knows so much about so many different things, and I gotta say that I really enjoy the company of someone who knows how to hold up their side of a conversation.    After dinner we went back to his place to smoke a joint and watch a flick. Ok, this guy: well-read (vei), knows a ton about movies and music, he's a [reformed--ha!] skater boy, has pierced nipples, and looks just  fantastic  with his shirt off! (yeah, yeah, yeah--what a sloot, I know.) And unlike a lot my picks lately, he's actually older than me, albeit only by a few months.   We watched Amelie... or at least, we started watching it, but we certainly didn't finish.  About an hour into it, he did the ol' yawn-and-stretch move, and had me cuddled against him.  Two seconds later we were makin' out!  Yowsa!  I still cannot believe how attracted I am to this guy.  He is a phenomenal kisser, and we seem to have such chemistry!  Still, I'm being only cautiously optimistic, but I'm still on high-alert. He's sooo by-the-book, that it's both comforting and disconcerting--it's nice when a guy already knows what to do, but a little unnerving when I realize it's probably 'cause he's got plenty of practice under his belt.  I mean, what am I to this guy?  Then again, what is he to me?
