Hmmm...I like how people in the UK and Ireland (and is Scotland in the UK? Well, if not, Scotland too) call their friends "mate".  I think I should start that.  I always liked that.  Wish I had one of those British accents, too.  Not a stuffy one...like the accents the people on Virgin Radio have.  They're just cool.    (On the radio now: REM, "Losing My Religion."  Whatever happened to some good ol' fashioned Nirvana?  Did everyone forget about them?  Garsh, Foo Fighters weren't that spectacular, they just found a good drummer in Dave Grohl.)  You like that AB pic at the top? The one with the fish? Yeah, me too.  Heeeheeeheee...Good Eats cracks me up.  "Mr. Funion."    Oh! If perchance you are ever privy to viewing this page, Alton, I'm really sorry that you were so sick like that!  You were in my prayers from the first minute I found out.  I feel good too, man!  cheers
