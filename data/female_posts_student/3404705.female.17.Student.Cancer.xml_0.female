That's B-O-R-E-D. i'm bored because you're boring. Hahaha. Nah just kidding.  Uhh, if there's someone out there who's very very familiar with this bloggy thing, drop me a few tips to personalize my blog ok?  Ok... i think I'm gonna dance to some music, although my legs are killing me. (Just got back from cycling with my monkeys.)  God, i'm bored. Cant wait till school starts. Bring on the good, bad and ugly people. Bring on the boring lecturers. Anything to make life... busier. I wish Teacher Rapiah would call me up to ask me to do some maths sums. Haha.   Signing out~~ Peace  Take Care
