I'm so happy. I missed him a lot. :) I'm glad we're back to being best friends.   And now, I'm just kind of hanging around waiting for dinner to be done. It's amazing. My brother's girlfriend is a chef so she like...reallly knows how to cook. She's so nice too. I love her. Seriously. I was just helping her make dinner/talking with her for like, an hour and a half. She's so fun/easy to talk to.   And now...I don't know. Maybe I'll go watch TV or something. YaY Christmas!!!!!!!!! :)
