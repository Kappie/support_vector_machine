Scorpio October 23 - November 21 Strange passionate stirrings within you could find you wanting to escape to somewhere away from civilization with a lover, dear Scorpio. This is a great day to do so. At the very least plan a quiet evening at home with the special someone in your life. You might also want to satisfy other sensual cravings, such as a desire for delicious food or drink, or for comfortable chairs or beds. Flow with it. We all need a little self-indulgence now and then!
