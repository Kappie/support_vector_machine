I  did  finish  Jacob's Room today, though.  Argh, I have something for that sports magazine to write about. Should I? Or can I just tell them that I'm at Harvard?  I really should get to work. Wendy's coming tonight! We're sleeping over in 16...er, not sleeping over. Just "staying up" so we don't break the sleepover rules.  And someone else might later on, too. I guess it's one of those little secrets that you keep to yourself to cheer you up whenever. I didn't even think it was possible, but it would be so nice if it happened. I just don't know what to say. It's just amazing...wouldthey actually do it? I can imagine taking the T to the airport and meeting them and just having an awesome weekend.  Enough now. Work time.
