He's was a good housemate. Cos' he slept most of the time and other than waking up to pee and eat... he really didn't do much. He was pretty quiet too. I think mostly cos' he slept the day away! *grins*    The house feels kinda weird now knowing that he's not around SLEEPING. See, even when he's sleeping, he's got that kinda presence! And the only time he ever made noise was when Andrew talked too loudly and it woke him up. He'd wake up and give Andrew a dirty look and then go back to sleep! *laughs* Miss you heaps Tim Tam! *huggies*
