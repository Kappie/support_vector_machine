Ok this is what I've done so far.  Friday: -Made it out of school- I had a 4 movie day, those are quite rare. It felt like the last day of school. -My mom picked me up b/c she needed my car, Mandy came with us, we went to Mellow Mushroom. -Due to a genius lie on my part (If I do say so myself), we got my mom to take us to Cold Stone, even though we were full.  -went to Lowe's Food (s?) -took Mandy home -drove myself to Tae Kwon Do at 7, went to my class then went to Sparring. (double class= stupid) -Had a weird sparring class, I sprained my ankle and like blacked out and couldn't breathe. Not fun. -went home, iced my ankle, actually had time to pleasure read, and went to sleep at like 10!  Saturday: -woke up, 8:45ish -called Mandy and Andy to wake them up -got ready and picked up Mandy -drove to Andy's and tried to get her to come to the Ren. Faire with us, it didn't work. -drove with Mandy to the Ren. Faire. Walked around the flea market a lot looking for the Ren Faire,  (both of us with sprained ankles), and feeling kinda dumb. We couldn't find it despite all of the signs, which we only saw when we were leaving (where is gate 8?) -we both bought some cool stuff at the Flea Market. There were these beaded bracelets for a dollar and I think I got 8. And I got this turkish thing, and...pencils, weird ones. -drove back to Andy to go to Crabtree (she came this time) -drove all around the freakin mall to find a parking spot, found one in BELKS not HECHTS. -walked around the mall, and saw Noah and some of the other cast memebers of Chess who were doing a little promotional concert for their show. -won free movie tickets to Briar Creek in some radio thing, too bad I have no idea where that is. -ate and walked around -went back to watch the Chess thing, this is where Mandy and Andy DITCHED me and thought it was funny to stand there and watch me trying to find them in the stores they SAID THEY WERE IN. (we were on our cells and they kept telling me to go to stores in which they would walk away from) -Took Andy home LATE HAHA, and Mandy home BEFORE CURFEW. -came home to see Forrest and Robin with Bailey and I played with my niece. -went to a pig pickin (?) with Robin and her friends. -came home, TV, and SLEEP.  Sunday: -woke up at 10ish -walked downstairs to find like 6 people in the kitchen and everyone wide awake. (my sisters friends had slept over) -made myself a monster breakfast -played with my niece and my sisters friend's baby Hunter which she brought over. -went out with my mom and Forrest and Bailey and Robin. -went to Rex Hospital to show off Bailey to all my mom's friends. -went to Applebees -went to Lowes to show off Bailey to all of Forrest's friends. -went home and watched TV and stuff while Forrest and Bailey and Robin went home. -found out surprising news about my brother-in-laws sister. (baby,16... man) -more TV and stuff -sat down and wrote in my blog about what I've done on my break so far  ....besides my ankle, I am so far fairly satisfied with this break.
