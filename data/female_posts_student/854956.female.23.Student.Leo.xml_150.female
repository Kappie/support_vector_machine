Now all I have to worry about is getting through one more week of work, and then I'm free for about 2-1/2 weeks!  YAY!  Our final grades aren't posted yet, but I already know that I got an A in my communications class... and quite honestly, I was sad to leave that one.  I really enjoyed that class, and I made several friends in there... of which I will probably only see a few from time to time.  Oh well... so goes life.  I wasn't very sad to walk away from ASL (Sign Language) though... it was just so much work and so very time consuming... I was sad to walk from my music classes... especially Dr. Bruenger's Music in Contemporary Life class.  Dr. Bruenger is just awesome.  I mean, how many professors would suggest figuring out thematic music for each individual in the class as if we were part of a sitcom?  Plus, there were really fun people in that class... like Zac and Jered.  I'll miss Aural Skills... even though we had to sight sing minor keys with the evil fi-si's... but I'll get round two of aural and music theory classes next semester with Dr. Balentine.  However, through all of this, I'm looking forward to the classes I have next semester.  I'm not taking any classes directly associated with teaching, though.  I mean, classes I NEED for my certification, but they have nothing to do with teaching methods and such.  I'm taking a math class and a science class/lab.  WEIRD!  Haven't taken those since my first two semesters of college!!!  Hmmm.... well, I must jet now... I'm off to take care of Christmas-related things... I shall post more later!  :-)  GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS to everyone else...!!!
