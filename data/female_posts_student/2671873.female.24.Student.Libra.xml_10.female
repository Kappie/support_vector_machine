We all reach this point in our lives where we must make the choice to follow those dreams we have set since the age of 5, or do what seems practical and make a living to support a family...blah blah blah.  We all have some sort of outline in our heads as to what we expect our life to be.  But recently I realized that maybe what I always dreamed of as perfect and wonderful isn't really what will make me happy.  Like most girls I have thought about the house I will live in when I am older and have a family, and the car I will drive when I haul that family around, and even the type of dress I want to wear at my wedding (seeing that there is a wedding in the future).  But as I think of this perfect life I have created within my imagination, I recently realized it lacked something....substance.  Not that all families that seem perfect are shallow, but there is something more there that I know I don't see, something that I know creates substance.  Having the Cooper Mini, and living in a 4 bedroom house on a hill overlooking a body of water no longer appeals to me.  Somewhere between graduating high school, and traveling the world I have discovered that I am no longer fearful of success (or lack there of).  I no longer need to worry about getting an education to cover my immense debt I have acquired over the years.  Rather I need to focus on being happy, and loving what I am doing and where I am.  If I am alone doing this, so be it.  However I never want to be so far away I can't see my family and friends, because that is what makes me happy as well.  I no longer want to look for that special someone who has the right job or the right car, rather I want to find someone who has the right happiness.  Is this possible, or am I just living in this delusion I call life.  Possibly it is this simple form of thinking that will allow me prosper in life, perhaps it will set me up for doom....either way it will be an adventure no matter the course I take.  I know this is the thought process of every twenty something, as I have had many talks with those twenty somethings in my life.  But I feel that this confusing part of my life is only the beginning of an adventure that will take me to far away places to see far away things.  If this is the adventure I get to take then I am willing and ready to take it!  My only question is are you?
