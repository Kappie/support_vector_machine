Very clever :P Uhh where's the santa's hat? I'm glad everyone had fun! But come on, the sadistic pass the parcel got everyone in a stupid mood. Wasn't it cool! *slightly obsessed with sadistic pass the parcel* Hehe we got Laura to gallop down the street with a plastic sword making the clip clop sound! Wow, how er... different? And dig my unarrangedness! I like parties more when they're go with the flow and not at set times we have to do set things *also it's a lot less hassal and I can be lazy* :D Ahh so long as everyone enjoys themselves who cares :P *that's my ethos* And don't worry... if anyone wasn't having fun I would've really made them dance on nails! But I did wear the sumo suit! *runs away leaving a big crater* (phew) Yup, in my head I make sense.
