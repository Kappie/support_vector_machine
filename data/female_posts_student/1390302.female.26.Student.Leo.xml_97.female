Yesterday was a very long day!  Matt and I went to Tarleton for Departmental Advising, I wasn’t feeling well, and we got very lost trying to find the school.  We had gone to Stephenville early in the year to take a look at the school and such.  It wasn’t that long of a trip, since all we did was go to the school and come home.  This time we couldn’t even find the school and ended up driving through and right out of the town!  It turns out, contrary to my first inclination, Stephenville is larger than I had believed!    It turns out that rather than having no grocery store to speak of they have 3 –a Super Wal-Mart, an HEB, and Piggly Wiggly (yes, I said Piggly Wiggly!).  They also have a JC Penny, Dunlaps, Payless Shoe Source, The Shoe Dept., Hastings, Cotton Patch, Taco Bell, KFC, Whattaburger, a movie theater, a shooting range, the school of course, and a lot of churches!  I have to say that I am quite pleased by this revelation!  I was dreading moving to a place that I thought had nothing, imagine my relief to find that they are an actual city.    Anyhow, Matt and I got very lost.  We eventually found the darn school, after a good deal of looking, and had our advising.  We’re both really pleased to be starting down there in the fall.  I am going to be an English  Sociology Major with a minor in French.  Matt will be majoring in Physics  Mathematics, no minor.  My program is 133 units base; Matt’s is 136 units base.  When you add the double major they add several more units.  Either way, we’re set to start school in August.  However, since Stephenville is something like 88 miles from us, we’re going to have to move there.  So far that has been a HUGE fiasco!  Looking for a place to live has proven to be easier said than done.  Most apartments are smaller than our current place –which is only 580 sq. ft.- and are about 150.00 a month more.  We also have all bills paid now and the apartments that are smaller and more expensive only pay water/sewage and trash.  Distressing is the only word for it.  The ones that are a reasonable size and rent don’t allow cats and we are not parting with Chummer.  Mostly we’ve run into a lot of expense and dead end. Then yesterday when we were in Stephenville I picked up one of their papers and found that these people are selling a mobile home for $8000.000 obo.  That’s a great price so we called.  It’s apparently in very good condition, though it’s old.  It was built in 1978 and has housed college students ever since, it’s also in a park.  It sounds like a good deal so we’re going to go check it out.  There’s also another place that has mobile homes for under $15,000 so we’re going to call them too.  Hopefully we’ll be able to work something out, for now it looks like Matt’s dad is going to help us out, thank goodness!  So now, the only problem is that we’re going to leave our place and get lost!  Hopefully we’ll just be able to start small and move up from there, maybe venture to Wal-Mart and back at first.  The place that we’re looking at is only one mile from TSU so it’s an ideal location.  The trick is going to be to move the week between school ending here and starting there.  It looks like Matt’s dad is going to be willing to help us move so that will be nice, we won’t have to do it all ourselves!  Maybe we can con some of our friends into helping us –hint, hint!    Someone I know actually suggested that we stay living in Waco and commute everyday to TSU.  That’s just impossible.  Matt had trouble staying awake on the trip home.  I felt like hell from not having any sleep and not having eaten in like three days.  We’re just not cut out for it, sorry Amanda!  So moving it is, though admittedly I am going to miss Waco.  I have really liked it here.  However, Stephenville is pretty close to my grandmother so I will –in theory- be able to go visit her more.    We paid $2.00 a gallon for gas yesterday!  $2.00 a gallon!!!!  It was 93 rather than 87 but still, $2.00 a gallon is insane!  Hope gas goes down by August but I have the feeling that it’s going to go up.  We’re going to have to buy gas for not only our car but also a U-haul, so I hope it goes down and helps us save our pocketbook.  $2.00 a gallon is another reason that we can’t commute.  Now, we’re going to have to go back to Stephenville to look at the place.  I hope it’s good, we really need this to be taken care of and I am going to be a basket case until it is.  Stress really bothers my stomach, and the only thing stressing me out right now is where we’re going to be living in two months.  I think I need to start eating more, my stomach has been acting up something fierce!  Maybe I’m just not eating the right things?  Anyway, that’s our life right about now, I hope everything works out and despite my stress it has been so far…wish us luck and if you pray, pray for us!  ~Kristyn (**STRESSIN’ OUT**)
