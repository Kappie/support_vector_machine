(he does this because he tries not to speak because of his throat) its so unnerving. not to mention when piper throws in her high-pitched scream of death. wow.   i feel so unaccomplished, still. i do absolutely nothing with my life. nothing. im surprised i even have enough to write about on here. probably because it involves other people, not so much myself. i turned in my application at Carino's today. found out i missed getting hired. if only i woulda brought the appl. back within that week. dammit! oh well. hopefully i'll get a job there soon. i "have a good chance" since i have no life and all i'll be doing is going to school until 1. lol. all i wanna do is work anyway. so thats alright.   a lot of things, which i really consider nothing, keep my mind occupied a lot of the day. i think about things that really dont hold much substance in the course of life. but seeing how thats all my life entails, its hard to think of other things. i dont think i made any sense there...   "i just want you to know who i am."  - the Goo  (if you dont know who that  really  is... heh, wow.)
