They want Gordon on drums but Gordon is too conceited! We might fail...! I don't know... we'll have to do this! Deadline for sign-ups is June 11!   First prize - $1000 and trophy Second prize - $800 and trophy Third prize - $500 and trophy Best instrumentals - $100 and trophy Best lyrics - $100 and trophy  If we make the auditions, we'll be performing on August 15 at La Rosa Grand Hall  Restaurant! Geez, I want to go sooo badly! This can get us somewhere! First prize winners get their song on a CD and it'll be sold in places! That would DEFINITELY bring us somewhere... pleeeeaaaase! Even a LITTLE publicity can get us noticed! Argh! I wanna do this soo bad! Even more badly than getting a cowboy hat! This is an opportunity of a lifetime! Please pray for us!  Well, I'm gonna continue talking about this to my friends... blog later.
