Anyway, I love the Irish boys but I also enjoy listening to  urlLink the Beatles ,  urlLink the Rolling Stones ,  urlLink Jean-Jacques Goldman ,  urlLink Yann Tiersen  , and others.  I don't really like Rap and Heavy Metal but I enjoy listening to Classical music and all sorts of melody.  I let you go and have a look at the different web sites mentioned above, some of them are quite cool.  Today I will start with U2 by posting the lyrics of the song which introduced them to me: "One". Actually, the story behind it is quite nice. My brother Edouard spent a month or two in America, 14 years ago I think, where he went to play tennis at the Bollettieri Academy. Well, he came back home with doublsized muscles (good for him!!) and an album of U2: "Achtung Baby". He said that the song number 3 was great (which was absolutely true!) and here you go, I fell in love with the group. I bought all their albums, I am a fan and I would like to share some of their songs with you...    "One"   Is it getting better  Or do you feel the same Will it make it easier on you  Now you got someone to blame You say one love, one life  When it's one need in the night It's one love We get to share it It leaves you baby If you don't care for it  Did I disappoint you  Or leave a bad taste in your mouth You act like you never had love And you want me to go without Well it's too late tonight  To drag the past out into the light We're one but we're not the same We get to carry each other, carry each other One  Have you come here for forgiveness Have you come to raise the dead Have you come here to play Jesus  To the lepers in your head Did I ask too much More than a lot You gave me nothing Now it's all I got We're one but we're not the same We hurt each other, then we do it again  You say love is a temple Love a higher law Love is a temple Love the higher law You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl And I can't be holding on to what you got When all you got is hurt One love, one blood, one life You got to do what you should One life with each other Sisters, brothers One life but we're not the same We get to carry each other, carry each other One One   Enjoy...
