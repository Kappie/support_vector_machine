Another practicum site is at a place called Pride in Arlington.  It's the same type of work-- pain management and rehabiliation.  However, the woman who I spoke to sounds scary!  And yet another one at the Denton MHMR clinic.  I'm not sure exactly of the type of work at the MHMR, but it would probably just be testing and counseling.    Anyway I decided it would be best to tour some sites instead of picking just one and sticking with that since I'll be stuck there for a full school year.  This could be bad if I hated it and I hated who I worked with.  And I would know this as I hated my practicum site before I transfered out of my last program at Texas State.  I also know I need to jump on these options as I'm competing with many universities and few positions.    So this leads me to my next question--- Where to live?  I know I don't want to live in Garland, Denton, or Arlington.  Garland is trashy, Arlington has too much crime from what I've heard, and Denton, well, Denton is just not as exciting as Dallas.  My prime choice is Addison.  And further North, I think it's North, would be Lewisville, and that's as far as I'd want to go I think.  I did look at some places to live in Lewisville 2 years ago and they have some nice places.  I'm not sure of the areas around Arlington, but uh I just don't think I want to live there.  Either way I guess I should prepare myself for a drive whereever I do decide to live.  Preferably I'll live close to my practicum as I'd be driving there more than I would to class.  Plans for next week include tour three practicum sites.
