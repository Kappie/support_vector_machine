SoNgS and DaNcE repeating over and over again.... I think the only programme the teachers loved was the cutting of the 6kg (that was what they said) cake and we, the graduating classes singing very noisy song up from the top. Jeezz, I know coz I have a auntie who is a primary teacher. She never really like the performance but appreciates it as the students have put in their best. The Power Of Teaching.....
