Work was fine, i was supposed to get off @ 7 but Robert asked me to stay til 8 [we were low on pple] so i stayed but didnt hafta fill out all the closing forms-YES! Went to the mall w/ my mom for a bit to return some of Jill's and my Dad's things--i bought these awesome shoes and this little sweatshirt that i adore. Called jana's cuz i knew she was getting in monday, but her plane wasnt landing til about 1130 that night. However, her mom told me her schedule and YAY we have spanish together-unfort. nothing else! BOO!   Tuesday was my day off. Jana and Ricky came by to pick up me and dan and we went and hung out over there for awhile! It was so much fun catching up with her + playing the fortune game! *lol* Then we celebrated Henry's birthday= dinner, cake, and presents! Then we went to see the Bourne Supremacy w/ Henry, Pete, Janban's mom, jana, and me while ricky and dan watched anchorman. Left around 10 cuz I hadta work this morning.  Today was pretty tedious- esp. in the latter hours of working. Worked from 6 45 to 4 15, crazy huh? However...means money! By myself in the morning w/ Steve shifting, then Alli came in, then Alex [whose no help]. Rode my bike home in the pouring rain! That was interesting! Actually it was pretty fun, altho light blue isnt too far off from white...
