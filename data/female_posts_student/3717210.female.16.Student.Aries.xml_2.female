I mean, neither of them know how to use a broom, let alone hold it.  I mean, it just makes me frustrated that some stupid person like that can make it big in this world.  Why do people like that get their own tv shows and their stupid record deals and everything when that's all they can do...and hardly that.  It's like any actor these days that makes it big, is just not happy enough with the odd millon or so that they make.  They need to put out a record album so they can make even more money so they can sit on their ass and pay people to take a shit for them.  Really now.  Hilary Duff did it, Ashley's doing it, and before long some other new young, 'hottie' will be doing it as well.  I guess it's a blonde thing.  Just kidding.  I have nothing against blondes.  Just people who really are dumb.  Not like, the mentally challanged...I mean the people who dont even bother to learn anything, like 2+2 and how to hold a broom and how to not cry when they brake a nail.  You know, the simple things in life.  Anyways...enough about them haha.  I never did watch Big Fish.  The preveiws looked dumb and no matter what I hear from anyone who's seen it and liked it, I just don't think I would.  I don't know.  Maybe some other time I will watch it.  But untill then there is this movie called EuroTrip.  That's a funny movie.  I was surprised that they showed a mans penis in the movie.  Well, actually, many men's penis's.  But they were all old and wrinkly and it was sort of yuck.  But a huge improvment from just a naked ass that was probably a womans anyway.  Its disgusting how they only show womens breasts on movies now a days.  Youd think that with the way the world is progressing things would, well...change.  Like I mean, we used to and some still do look down upon people with body peircings.  but more and more people are getting them, proving that we aren't all prudes.  That though some people can't learn to take change in their stride, most others can.  Which is good because I myself have a nose ring and plan on getting an eyebrow ring.  My friend Leslie has an eyebrow ring and she plans on getting another.  Trust me, they look pretty good with two of them...we seen this cute guy at the movie gallary and he had two eyebrow rings and a tounge ring and that inbetween the lip and chin thing done too, and he was mighty cute!  Serisously.  But yeah, we are of course, the only two in our group of friends that have anything other than our ears pierced (yeah we have that done too).  Leslie wants to get her bellybutton peirced just for kicks...not to show it off or anything, but just to have one.  Shanna (my other friend) wants to get her bellybutton pierced too.  Shanna just has this thing called an uncooporative father.  Me and Leslie on the other hands have what you might call, cool parents.  Well, I have a cool mom, she has the cool parents.  My dad is a whole nother story Ill tell you about tomorrow.  That reminds me, I was supposed to drop off his father's day card...shit.  Ill do that tomorrow too ahha.  This whole my friends have a job and I don't thing sort of sucks because, while they are at work, I am at home thinking of things to do when they get off of work or am babysitting which is cool because that is a job, technically.  Cats are suckers man.  I was just torturing mine (not really but I was trapping her under a blanket so she'd stay by me and it didn't set well with her) and she darted so fast when I let her go...now I was like here kitty kitty kitty kitty...and she came, as always.  Her name is Fred...my mom says its short for Fredriqa (something like that) but it's really not, she just says that because Fred is not really a girls name so she sort of feminized it.  We have two other dogs as well...Tess, and Old English Mastiff, and Angel, a Land/Rotweiler mix.  Tess is huge and Angel is fat.  Sam, my evil younger step sister has a mini weiner dog named leah (the spelling on that just doesnt look right so ill pronunciate it for you...lee a...thats how it sounds when you say it) she's pretty cute though...her and the cat always hold an all star wrestling match in the living room...you can catch it at 8 pm on sundays haha just kidding.  But my pussy can kick her weiners ass.  Haha I like to say that because it sounds perverted.  That's another thing about me...Im sort of a pervert.  Not bad...just the funny haha jokes about perverted things.  So anyways, im bored, your bored, we are all bored...im gonna get the hell out of here.  Maybe watch EuroTrip yet again...or maybe my all time favorite movie the leauge of extradinary gentalmen. (that was naughty...haha...thats like my favorite saying from that movie).  Catch yall later! (yall as in who ever might be reading this considering I havent told anyone about it yet so I might actually be talking to a virtual wall for all I know...go ahead and leave some comments or something...so I know im not alone in here haha).
