Also, he usually blogs every day, and I don't think he has been on snooboo for a day or two. Hope he hasn't lost the will to live already, we're not supposed to do that until we actually get our GCSE results. No, I'm joking, where the hell is he? Hope everything's okay. I will come and see 8  mile if other peeps r going too!
