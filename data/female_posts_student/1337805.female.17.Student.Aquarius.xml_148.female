Trying to change the templte of my blog, but the site in which I found the most goooooooooorgeous template is being a loser, and won't tell me, in simple HTML/Blogger code how to make it work. Must...find...new..one. It went with my comments so perfectly too. Eh.  Preparing to re-ban people again. Recieved not one, but now two threats on my life.  Sorry Jess, I'd like to be able to forgive you. But you started this with your friends. Get them to stop, and I will. Thanks.  Love the sexy comments you picked for me San. They are just enchanting, like your eyes ;)   And Chris, Sanford can do whatever the hell he wants on my blog, because he is the blog-god. If he feels the need to comment on a blog, then he can. In fact, he didn't barge in. He was doing what he does, comment.   Happy turkey day to you turkey slaghterers. Now I'm off to wrestle my straightener (piece of crap that it is) and to find templates. Ciao.
