There is so much that I want to say about it, but I don't even know where to start. We actually got through most of the preCal, though now I am not sure whether he wants to go out with me. Damn boys sending mixed signals. Meanwhile, the soap opera continues with Amanda... Ok, I just needed to write a bit, but there is so much more to say. I have to go! :P
