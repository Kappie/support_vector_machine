But other than that it was fun. Some weird guy called me last night and was like "what are you doing" and i said "nothing, what are you doing?" and he goes "laying in bed thinking about you." and i was like ok. I have no idea who it was and so i said gtg bye and hung up. So if anyone knows who it was please please please tell me. well i got to go strip the bed and wash the sheets for Tomoko, b/c she comes today. ciao
