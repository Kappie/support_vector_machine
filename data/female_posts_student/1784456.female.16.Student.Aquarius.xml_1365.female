And for the record! ...I was more afraid of the toilet monster. :| Go figure. Woohooo psychological jargon! (Most of it is!) If you study something too much then you may miss the real meaning. (That's what I keep telling myself!) But seriously, if everyone studied stuff too much no one would live! On that minute point *seriously minute* what do you do when you do nothing? You know... when you're really trying to think about nothing. I play piano in the air. Hell, at least I'm not thinking about actual stuff! It's bad to do that! Well sometimes. When you get all caught up in it, and you forget the breathe then it's bad! *geez it's hard remembering how to spell breath and breathe!* Well I guess someone had to say it! (And it had to be me *sigh*) Any way... I'm ill and tired. Night night.
