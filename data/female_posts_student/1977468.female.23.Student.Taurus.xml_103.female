I'm sure breanna will like the new title of the site, as it now includes her. I discovered how a CSS style file works, which makes things a little easier.  What do you do when someone's actions directly contradict what their mouth and their face and their body tells you? Do you listen to the actions or them? Or do you stop talking to them altogether...  Why is this a concern? Well, its not. Truthfully, it would be prideful to think it has anything to do with me. The only thing it has to do with me is that I'm the insertable varible in her equation of how her charactor/ideals/problem solving skills apply to life. I'm not the solution or the cause, just an interactive witness.  I keep seeing ads for "flexible cds". What? Does making them bendy somehow improve them? The only way to find out is to buy them, and find creative uses. In that way... I guess that the advertisers won. It's like making a product that nobody needs, and since it makes no sense people are intrigued enough to try them. Anyone remember that gameboy you put on the table, and you put your eyes up next to it cause they're shaped like goggles? The display was just red and black. It's comparable.
