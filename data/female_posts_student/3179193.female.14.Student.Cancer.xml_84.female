My friends and I talked in the stairway for a while. (Friends = IngiEE, Zoe, Erica, Candace, Vivo, and Mark) Lisa walked in, everybody said hi, then bye. After a while, we walked into the gym and I saw Nima on the stage. I went to sit beside him and wanted to talk but he was teaching a girl guitar stuff so I just watched. After a while, him and Nathan ran off to play basketball so I'm like: "Okay, whatever". So much for talking to him. Then, Jason came over and sat beside me. We started talking and joking around. He poked my cheek and I poked him back. Then he poked Ingrid's cheek and she just jumped and laughed. It's like... his way of saying hi. Kinda like what Nima used to do to people... poke. Erica pokes too. Haha...! Anyway... so we all talked and then after what seemed like ages, Nima finished playing his dumb basketball and came over. He looked at us and I said hi. He went and played on the piano so I was just like "whatever" inside my head and continued talking with Jason and other people. I wanted to go sit beside Nima and talk but he probably would go back to basketball and I didn't want to feel like an idiot being left alone so I just let him be and he played the piano while we all just talked. I felt bad for staying there, talking with Jason instead of with Nima but then decided not to feel bad since he was the one who just ran off for basketball anyway. Now I just plain miss him because he hasn't even really talked to me at Bethel so all night I'm just like: "whatever" to myself when he doesn't talk to me and goes off doing his own thing. When we go out to play hockey, do you really think I go to play hockey?! I only go to see him! So now, instead of thinking "whatever", I'm thinking "wtf". But you know what? Screw it.
