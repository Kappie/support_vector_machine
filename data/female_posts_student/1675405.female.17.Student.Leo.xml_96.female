Ben stopped over today by surprise, and asked me out for Friday night. Fine with me, I just hope he is not anticipating any more than going as friends. I'm just tired of dealing with the stupid trivials that boys have thrown into my face, and frankly, I'm not in the mood to tolerate it anymore.    I have to go to "adult-sit" tomorrow morning. It's going to be really weird.   I'm going to wish myself the sweetest dreams tonight because I think I deserve it.
