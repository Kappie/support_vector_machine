So he asked me to take over, and handle everything on the website. I will just say this:  "There is no room for two Emmons by Ian's side, and it looks like once again, I win Ian's trust and not anybody else". I also can't thank Ian enough for forgiving me for what I did. I think he has realized that I am right in a couple of ways. It may have been better if Ian and Abby never did get back together.
