Actress doesn't think she can act any more (which is devistating for her), her cousin is dieing of cancer and her friends aren't that great at the moment. Not myself but her best friends, we'll call them Ash and LoudM. Lucky for her she has a good friend taking care of her at the moment. I won't even give him a name it's not worth it, and I probably won't talk about him often. I'm just saying all this because she has real problems, I mean her folks kicked her out of her house becasue  they  couldn't deel with  her  depression. Really it's kind of sad when adults can't take care of their own offspring, really! I'm saying this because I go to high school and notice all the angst just flying around. People like Actress have real problems, people that go about moaning because they think they're way too fat when really they are a size ten or something like that don't have real problems. I mean this is just me saying all this and when it's my angst I'm sure I'll be moaning around too, but it's just annoying me the way people seem to ignore the real issues. My school had two deaths in one day. A grade nine and a grade twelve, they didn't even know eachother! They most likely had real troubles, bad hair probably wasn't one of them, guys that's just a bad day. But what really disgusted me was the fact that people were running out of class crying those days, even if they weren't sad, they did it to get out of class. How disturbing!   My councilor likes to talk to me, I tell him my issues aren't that big in comparisson. He seems to think they are, it's kind of nice to know that I'm not the only person out there looking out for the mental health of the student body. Most of my friends come to me or my Bethie (my best friend) for councilling and general comfort. It's amazing how many cutters there are out there! As well as kids who have attempted suicide. It kind of makes a girl think.   Well I'm going to try and be normal now! Ooh Kim Possible! YES!!!!! There goes normal...  P.S. My brain is saying no more typing, my carples seem to agree... They're conspiring...  P.P.S Damn body.
