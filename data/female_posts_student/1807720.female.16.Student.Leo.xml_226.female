       
       Ok, so I did something totally embarrassing today. My mom was like "Vanessa, take me shopping to Safeway." So we went to Safeway and I knocked some guys basket things over while he was setting up a display. I guess I misjudged how far away it was from the cart. It also made a really loud bang. And then she was like "Geez Vanessa, can't you be more careful." Like, GRRRRRRRRR I was friggin being careful. It's like it's always my fault and well I guess it was, but I really didn't mean to. She doesn't get it. I didn't try to knock all that shit off the shelf.  I had another break down today. When the stress builds up it's not a good feeling. I always have this recurring notion that I am different. I mean yes we are all individuals, but there is something just not right. I know it, and I have known it for a long time. By now I am practically certain. People are always like aww sweetie your a hard worker and everything, and seriously your just being too hard on yourself. And like seriously people don't know shit about my life or about myself. They don't see what goes on behind the scenes, they don't see out of my eyes, they don't know!!!!!!!! I wish I could scream: Can't someone PLEASE understand!!!!!!! Your know just to understand what I am going through would greatly be appreciated. I mean right now isn't as stressful as school, but nonetheless it's a stressful time. I admit I am usually pretty happy during summer, but not today. Maybe it's the the PMS kicking in for once, but I highly doubt that cause usually turn into the nicest gal you've ever met at that time. I have always considered the possibly of having a learning disability, but everyone else seems to shrug that idea off. They don't think it could be possible. They laugh at the idea. I don't get it though, I mean why??? Why do they just automatically shrug of they idea when they no nothing about what I struggle with and what I have trouble with???? Why...Why...WHY???? I KNOW for a FACT though, something is wrong, wrong, WRONG.... I do think it could be possible and am open the idea that is it may very be possible. I guess people just really don't see or understand what I deal with and go through. I suppose I hide the things I find difficult, but I mean if I don't have some kind of learning problem then what is wrong????  I wish I knew how to talk to someone about this. I mean first lets start with the reading cause that like affects my life in too many damn ways. When I read I don't understand what the hell I am reading. It makes no sense unless I read it like ten times. Even then sometimes I just don't get the connection. When we did Reading Comp in English this is like a seriously problem. There just is NOT ENOUGH TIME to read something like ten times over. When I read something once I don't even remember what I just read. I mean no wonder I never understood how to do the math word problems. I didn't understand what the hell they were asking. During the English Final I got the biggest friggin headache of my life. It's hard to concentrate when your heads hurts. When I was doing the Social 30 diploma recently I started to get this pounding in my head. The diploma was also when I realized there was something is seriously wrong. I could not focus on the words I was reading or well trying to read. I am going to sound like a major nut case but like the words were like moving. I usually don't have problems like focusing, but this was different. It seemed like the text was too dark and the words were all too close together. I know it sounds like really weird, but it indefinitely was happening and there was nothing I could do. I just tried to focus as much as possible and infer the meaning to the best of my ability. Of course by the end of the diploma I started to get a headache, but not as bad as the English final. The more I read, the more my head hurts. I am at the point where I would rather do just about anything but read.  Then there is my job situation. I feel like such a loser. Practically half of my friends that want jobs have jobs. I used to have a job too, but only because I got it through a friend of a friend. You know how the story goes. That lasted about seven months believe it or not. I just worked hard and most managers liked me because I was kind and friendly. It didn't really matter though because no manger ever had the courage to fire anyone. Anyways, getting back to my point I have applied at every place that classifies you at the bottom of the work chain. Wendys, Burger King, IGA, Co - op, Safeway twice (diff. locations) Half of the time I even dropped off my resume to the managers, which is a must these days cause half of the people just throw your application in the garbage. Do you think I got one call for any of those places. All the fuck I wanted was a job to earn money so I could pay for the stupid gas my car needs to get me places. By all means it's not my resume, it's practically perfect and my list of extra-curriculars are astounding. It's not like I have never worked before because I do have experience. How pathetic do you think it feels to not even be able to get a job at burger king or wendys. You always need people for fast food. And everytime, no call, no interview, no job. I mean I suppose it might be the fact that I am NOT going to work every damn day of the week. Sorry, I had a life and would like to maintain at least half of the good part. These days it's always like everyone wants you to dedicate 110% of your time to work and work only. Sorry, but I won't and I refuse. I wonder if I filled out the stupid application's wrong, they were all confusing. Too many boxes and confusing words, except for the Wendy's application. Maybe they just assume people applying there aren't that smart so they need a simpler method of obtaining employment.  Then there was this day when some strange guy stopped at my house and asked me how to get to MillView Bay. Ok, I mean Millrise is composed of streets that all friggin start with Mill so you tell me how the hell would I know how to get there. Then comes my mom and pulls out a map. "Here Vanessa you figure it out." Guess what, I couldn't figure it out. I didn't feel that bad though considering the guy was trying to read the map too. To both of us it made no sense. So I suppose it isn't so abnormal to not be able to read a map. It was kind of stupid though cause it took us like 15 minutes to find the street on the map. Really, that honestly tells your nothing. Ohhhh a street name with squiggly lines all around it, which too many colors...like how the hell is that suppose to tell you where to go. Ok, so there is my next secret - I wouldn't say I cannot a map (saying you can't do something is degrading) but I would simply have to classify myself and an inefficient map interpreter. That sounds better than can't read maps. I still remember when me and my friends when to greek fest, I got lost three times.  Wow, this is a long journal entry but I feel a little bit better now. I can finally unleash some of what I am feeling. I am not sure if you would call it stress or not. I've always wondered if my childhood ever had a slight affect on me and the way I am now. I ran into a wall when I was five if that says anything. I honestly didn't see it, maybe that is why I can be such a bad driver. I just don't "see" things sometimes. I have almost run over people like four times now, and once I almost did it with four other people in the car. I swear my driving is going to scar them for life, but they said they still trust me. Go figure, they must be real true friends if they have that much trust in me. Failing drivers ed was yet another bullet shot at me in my life time. That was hit me pretty hard though. I couldn't remember any of the parts of the car and the fluids colors. At the time it seemed so stupid to have to learn that stuff, but now that I drive more I realize that it is pretty important. I waited six months before driving again after the drivers ed. My self-esteem had never taken at hit as hard as that one. I had failed things before, but this was worse because half of the world talks about how fun driving is. I think it is fun now, but it took me about a year to realize that. After eight months following driving ed I got my licensee, but NO ONE knows how much effort I had to put it. I mean more effort that ANYTHING I have ever done in my life. Anyone who knows me knows my level of effort is like 500%. I put more into learning to drive. Once Feb 2004 hit, I practiced with my mom EVERY night and MORNINGS and NIGHT practiced my parking. This went on for months until the Easter weekend in April. I swear I will always remember that day. Just the feeling of: I got my license and actually did something right for once. That is a feeling you can never replace. Only I know how hard it was to get that license that occupies its glorious space in my wallet. I also had sleep apnea when I was a kid. According to my mother I would snore so loud she could hear through walls, then for a minute it would be silent. I would be like practically lifeless for a minute. I had an operation to remove my adenoids and my tonsils were taken out. After that it never happened again, but I think that could have like had a major affect on me - like killed maybe like a couple thousand brain cells or say....affected my learning.  Call me paranoid because maybe I am. Call me crazy because maybe that's the answer. I just wish I had an answer though. To a lot of things. A solution. Something that could make me understand just why sometimes things to challenge me in ways sometimes far beyond where I ever thought my limits could extend. I don't know what's wrong, I only know what I THINK is wrong. I wish I knew what was wrong me with. Maybe I am just a teenager, maybe that is the problem. The difference between me and everyone else though is that none of my other friends and people I know and keep in contact with experience anything close to what I experience. I know for a fact they don't go through as many times of struggles and frustration as I have been through. From the outside I seem like the happy, hardworking girl who at times doubts herself. On the inside I am a confused and struggling teenager.  If we are to look back in time I also thought I was pretty different from other people. I was always the kid who didn't understand, the slow one, the misbehaved girl. I was pretty badly behaved during grade two, but only because no one cared that I didn't understand anything. I would always be ignored and I suppose you could say I wanted attention. That year I drew so much on my desk in pencil, it was completely covered. I don't actually blame myself for the horrible marks I got that year or any year after. I tried to copy off of others math tests all the time. Being a cheater in school was how I passed half of my school stuff anyways. I didn't know how to count money or tell time. Thank goodness I know now, but I didn't know how until about grade 4/5. I also used to work with some strange lady one-on-one with counting and everything. That helped, but as I got older people had no respect for those whose marks shot up when they got individualized instruction. A couple years ago I also found an old report card - it was from grade 3. I started to read the comments on it and mentioned was remediation of certain math skills. To this day I still don't know half of my math shit. It's sad to say that I still don't understand how to round even though I have been repeatedly show, most graphs I can't seem to understand or interpret so most tests that involve interpreting graphs I simply just guess, and I don't know how to reduce fractions or ratios. I just guess on all of those things and hope I am right. Somehow I manage to get through math every year by hard work, practice, and help of others. And well I can tell time by now of course, but I can't just take a glance at my watch, I have to like really stare before I know the time. Memorizing my multiplication table - that didn't happen until grade five. My parents made me work on that every night and I still don't even remember half of it. Thank God for calculators though, I don't know what I would do without one.  Then came the year I lost most of the friends that I did have. I didn't have many in second grade because no one wanted to be friends with the "misbehaved dumb girl." In everyone's eyes that is what I was. Growing up was hard for me. At times I feel glad to be a teen, because being a teenager is better than being young. Anyways, I was little miss violent in grade four but some how friends with the 'popular' kids. No one like me though especially after this time I beat up a girl named Brittany. I became quite and reserved after that spending every recess alone. It's funny though cause me and Brit still keep in touch today even though she goes to a diff. high school and are amazing friends. They year after I met Chels, my best friend and partner in shopping forever. My life changed for a while. I still almost failed half of my classes, and even Chels admits to this day: "I remember you being so bad at school." That year Chels and I were probably the two most unpopular people. Grade six eventually came along - what a nightmare. The few friends that I had previously made before I was separated from that year. Before long I became the most hated person - literally. I almost killed myself that year because at times I have to admit the verbal abuse stared to get to me. That was also the year of ultimate weight gain. Not to mention the teachers I had were horrible, they had no respect for me or anyone who didn't seem to understand anything for that matter. I tried my best, but it was never good enough.  If people wonder why I doubt myself so much...well there is the reason why. Blame my grade six teachers, they stomped all over the self-esteem I did have. I didn't get very many recesses that year either, because they always kept me inside. My English work was never good enough, they would make me re-answers to novel questions during recess. I would have to do homework again that I had 'tried' the night before. It seriously was not my fault thought that I didn't understand what I was reading. I realize that now. Everytime I would spent that fifteen minutes crying wonder why everyone else got to go out. It wasn't fair. When I stayed in at recess to do the work again, my answers were usually better than the first time only because I had read the same chapter like five times by then. This led the teachers to assume I just didn't care about work and wasn't trying. That was a frustrating feeling and made me almost not want to try anymore because no one realized how hard I worked. Because of this frustration I wouldn't complete spelling assignments and when I asked about math questions the teachers explanation never made sense. I didn't finish half of my math assignments. And again the explanation was "she's not trying." How did they expect me to finish them when I didn't understand. If I understood half of the work that year, I honestly would have finished it. I honestly would have done it. It seemed like a better option to look as if I didn't care than to look stupid. Instead of being frustrated with work though, it was easier just to not do it. Shortly after my mom met with those two teachers and to this day I still have no idea what they talked about. I asked what they talked about to my mom, but there was never a response. My mom wasn't even that upset after that meeting either. I don't know why, but to this day I think she is still hiding something from me. There is something she has not told me.  After that I was sent to the resource room for math, but it was like already passed the half way point of the year. I do admit I desperately needed help with math, but those people did not need nearly as much help as me. I am not exaggerating. First of all the people already knew the ladies, I didn't. They understood the math, I didn't. They knew how to ask for help, I didn't. There were too many kids and I was actually ignored more than anything. As far as I am concerned, the other kids there honestly did not need any help at all. They all understood perfectly well. That is when I realized that no one else struggled with all this math as much as me. No one else really had any of the same difficulties I had experienced. I mean out in the world there are definitely people like me. They are out their somewhere, but they sure weren't in that school. I would NEVER cheat today, don't get me wrong but back then cheating was the only option. I had a D in math and was afraid I was going to fail all of my courses. I was scared so I cheated. I cheated on EVERY sing grade six achievement test except math. I know it would look suspicious if like all year I practically failed math and then got like an 80%. That would just be too obvious. I copied off this smart kid sitting in front of me. He doesn't know it to this day. I got away with cheating. Most people find it a bad thing, and I do admit it is very wrong but it motivated me. I never believed I could do anything from all my experiences in the previous years. And then I realized here was this girl who just got away with cheating, you know wait a minute but if I could cheat then I could do anything.  Grade seven rolled along. My life changed. This guy Joseph that was the only one who talked to me all the time in grade six stopped me from taking my life. I mean that was a horrible year. I found out he was moving away to a country overseas. I was scared at first wondering what I would do without him, but once he left I realized that he helped me get through a rough time and now all I can do is just make friends, be happy, and try my best. So that is exactly what I did. People came from different schools and most of them didn't know me. It was my chance to start over. I made honor roll every term that year. I went from the girl with a D in math to the girl on honors. I did it without cheating. I never cheated again after grade six. I realized to work hard and to fail is always better than to cheat. And when we work hard and we succeed it is an even greater reward because only you know truly how hard your worked for something you wanted to badly. I also used to have a really bad acne prob and like all over my back too. That also why ne of the reasons why no one liked me in grade six. I was "disgusting" according to most guys. I couldn't really change anything though, you can't change genetics. Both of my parents had acne, which means 100% chance of me getting it. By grade seven though, no one really cared. In fact, today I have it under better control after trying like 5 million things I finally found something that works pretty good. A lot of guys say I am hot and beautiful now and I get hit on at the gym all the time. It's pretty funny.  I worked hard in grade eight and managed to make honor roll only once. I worked hard though and everytime missed honors because of my math mark. Always the math. I guess you could say I tried new things though. I used to be reserved, quite, shy, barely talked. I had played Soccer for many years, even made div 1 before (and yes I am still pro at soccer) Anyways, I tried out for the Senior girls volleyball cause I am a sports person. I had never tried Volleyball before. Out of the girls there were over fourty girls to begin with. I made it into the top twenty but didn't make the team. So I tried for juniors and definitely got on. I wouldn't say I was nearly half as good at it though as Soccer, but it was fun, different, and at least I made friends and talked with people. I also tried out for the badminton team, I made the cut for that. Most games I lost, but really I had fun. I am way better at badminton today than I was back then. I sucked at doubles though, I realized that. I am the dominant one...likes to take control. I rock at singles badminton.  So grade nine eventually came along. Nothing really changed much except I went into another state of depression for a while. I admit I was unhappy for various reasons. Well, first of all English comprehension was a struggle like usual, but I was a good writer. There was no doubt about that so the teacher always assumed I didn't need any help because I did good on English. Social was just one big confusion but for like everyone. Our teacher always gave up tests that were like two grade levels higher and would do stupid things on M.C. tests like made eight answers in a row all A so like half of the class would fail. It was the class where my ability to write didn't pay off cause I had no idea what was going on half of the time. Math was the worst. What a nightmare. I still remember being kicked out when I said something 'apparently' rude. I wasn't trying to be rude. Half of the teachers just thought I was doing it on purpose. Anyone who knows me knows I would NOT purposely try to be inconsiderate. I quit my job that year, the only job I have ever had in the last well about four years. Eventually balancing school and work became to much. It was just too difficult. It was either fail or quit and pass. So I quit because I wanted to get into all the highest possible classes in high school. I wanted to be with all my friends. Getting the mark I needed for math pure was by far the most difficult, but I did it. I sure proved that I could do it to. I have passed math 10 and 20 with fairly good marks now - better than the marks I got in j.h. math. I always had this knack for science though. That was one my things. I studied day and night to get the marks I got in that course. I think was only like a low 80% but that is good and I work damn hard for it. Science interested me and still does today.  It was strange though because in grade nine I also ended up with Drama as one of my options and I didn't even put it as one of my choices. I hated it the entire year, I complained about it every day but I was good at it. When the head of the board for drama or whatev her title was came, the teacher told me she wanted me to do my monologue first cause she needed to make a good impression on this lady. I never felt so good after that. Everyone - even people who never talked to me, they came up and told me that they were scared to go up now because mine was so good. I know mine was good. I realized I had a talent. Drama, acting, performing, whatever you want to call it. At the end of the year the school gave out medals to those who got the highest mark in all the classes except like comp and things like that. Then they called out: Top Drama........Vanessa Boila. I knew it too, in my mind I just knew it would be my name. I had a 98. To beat me you practically had to be perfect. I had hated Drama so much that year, and initially what most people don't know if that when I chose my courses for high school Drama is not what I initially chose. When I got my schedule mailed to me for grade ten I looked at it and was like: This isn't right. So I went to the counselors and switched fashions to five credit Drama. That was fate right there working in the hands of time. I could have not been more happy. I met Megz, we are awesome together, partners on stage. We both played fairies in A Mid Summer Night's Dream and we do tons of stuff together now. I know for a fact after high school we are going to stay in touch. There is no doubt in my mind.  Grade ten I would probably have to rate as the best year of my life. Sometimes I wish I could just go back in time and relive that year. I mean for the most part it was good and less stressful than many other times in my life. It was kind of embarrassing though when I was asked "who's your T.a." and well I didn't remember. At least I had a good excuse though. I mean we had gone through three other people before my permanent T.A. came so no wonder I didn't remember who anyone was anymore. High School was a big change for J.H. I realized that there were teachers that cared, ones that did hate me cause I wasn't 'perfect' or just didn't understand. They didn't, blame or critisize, they just accepted whatever came their way. That kind of difference goes a long way. No teacher had ever asked me about anything I was ever interested in before like Mrs. J. No one ever cared the way she cares. In High School there are teachers like Ms. L who even though they appear scary they encourage you, push you, and actually BELIEVE you can succeed. That is the biggest difference. Teachers in j.h. would just assume that I wasn't capable, but then high school came and here were a whole bunch of people who just supported me, accepted me for who I was, and believed that I could succeed.  That doesn't change the fact that I struggle with math and some other things. It doesn't change the fact that I failed half of the things in Chem. Really it's not that big of a deal. I learned a lot in that class. Directions for labs confused me a lot. A lot of times I just sat there watched everyone else cause I was confused. I wanted to understand though and I tried to participate as much as possible. Math was difficult, but a lot more difficult in grade eleven. Especially because the teacher more like ignored me pleas of "I don't understand." Everyone is like: Oh just practice and stuff. I did so bad on most of the tests except the one where she actually sat down and went through the stuff with me. Once I even told her specifically that I didn't understand and need help, and the teachers reply was: "Oh do you have ____ day free, ___ time free" but like I just simply was not available those times. Then she just said: "Well I can't help you then" and I was completely left in the dark for that unit. The schedule worked way better the first year. At least there was time to eat lunch.  In grade twelve I need to focus on getting into university and keeping up that marks. Ever since grade seven I have known I want to be a teacher and since grade ten I have known I want to do something in the science area. I don't care how difficult it is cause I am going to do. I have gotten this far now there is no turning back. I just got to keep trying my best. Trying and working my ass off is all I can do. I want to major in Bio and do a minor in Chem. Yup, that's what I am going to do. Diploma's are a stupid part of grade twelve that I don't want to have to deal with, but that is just a fact of life. Before I know it they will be over and I will old...ahhhhhh. I want to meet someone who is not into himself and an asshole. Can't someone half decent come along...???????? I miss Aaron from Halifax but chances are I won't see him again. I don't know if I should feel this way or not, but I think that I am attracted to Brent. I don't know why. A lot of people would be like: "Why him?" you know and well he is easy to talk to. Once I got to know him better I found he was pretty nice and is fun. He always says I am smart too, while most guys claim that I should have been born a blonde. Most guys like me for my looks only and that is annoying. I have always wanted to marry like a crazy hot science guy though or a teacher, or someone totally into sports. My requirements are:   Must like to go the gym often  Likes sports and puts priority of having fun first  I get to shop and cook, the guy cleans  Must want two children  Go to Catholic church on a regular basis or does not go but is eagerly willing to go  Must be a part in the kids lives, I don't want to do it alone  Must have a successful career or head in the direction towards one  Likes to eat healthy, no junk in my house - No pop! No chocolate!  Does NOT speak another language, I hate that  Does NOT have an accent cause half of the time I don't know what those poeple are saying  Likes to go out a lot and get away from the house  Likes cats  Funny and good personality  No really long hair...yuck! (Must be well groomed!)   Ok yeah that like has to be the longest post in the history or my journal writing. I think I am done now. My head hurts from thinking so much.
