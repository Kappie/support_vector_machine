Last night was fun, I played  Chrono Cross  for about an hour for lack of anything else to do, went upstairs, hit the lights, and knew no more.  Well, I talked to my dad first, and he helped to alleviate some of that emotional distress I was talking about yesterday. My dad's a good guy, he can't do anything but justify my problems, which, I tell myself, is just teaching me that all the wrong directions I'm taking in my life are the right ones; but somehow I'm able to get his real message and things turn out better. It seems like his old girlfriend, the one that made me all screwed up last year, has started talking to him seriously, and he told me some vaguely suprising stuff. That he still cares for her in the way he did before, he says not much has changed since he talked to her last. At the same time, it's not a surprise, considering how involved they were, despite that relationship's brevity. At the same time, she's married, but I speculate she has the same feelings. It's causing my dad some undue distress; and that little segment only took two of the thirty minutes, which can tell you how much we can talk about in a short time.  Time for me to go.
