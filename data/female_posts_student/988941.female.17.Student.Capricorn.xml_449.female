We went into Croydon this morning because you wanted a necklace and a hair accessory for Friday's Leavers Ball. We looked in every shop possible (lol!) and in the end you bought a clear clippy thing that you can put in your hair in about 6 differernt ways for an 'up-do'. Let me know how it goes and how you're going to have you hair! You didn't buy a necklace though. Tom bought some stuff in Next and something in Smiths that completely escapes my mind, and then he bought Die Another DAy in HMV, where he also paid for my Harry Potter CD because he had a voucher to use (but there is money sitting here next to me waiting to be given to him on Tuesday morning!). Then we went home because I had a rehersal to get to, and by the time I had got home I had 10 minutes to eat lunch before I had to go out again! I then went to a rehersal for my concert next week, and I think it's going to be a really good one, even if I say so myself. Imagine 6 clarinets all playing melodiouys and spectacular tunes, and that's what you;'ll get next Sunday! One boy is totally hopeless though, I think he's gonna be kicked out and replaced, lol!!!  Anyway, I have just done a make-up trial for the ball and have decided against weird and wonderful makeup, I'm just gonna go with natural colours on!! Nothing blue or purple, I'm gonna look normal. ANyway, my hair is gonna be quite, um, different, so I don't wanna over do it. Other than that, I'm all sorted now! yay! I'm so excited about it!  I'm going to do some revisoin this evening, and apparently we're going out for a family day tomorrow. Yippe. ACtually, we haven't been out anywhere for ages, so it should be good. Better go, I think I have to go and cook a vegetable curry!
