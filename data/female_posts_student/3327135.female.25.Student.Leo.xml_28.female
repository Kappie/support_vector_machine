Too bad, I talk so loud as though I am selling something at the "pasar malam" or wet market! :D hhahaha..  Love Flora's singing more than Sammi's currently. Anyway, I was a fan of Sammi from her acting in the Journey of Love TVB series and not really someone who admire her singing skills. But, currently, I think Flora's singing is quite good.    Do vote for whomever you think is a better singer at my poll.            Who is a better singer?          Flora Chan         Sammi Cheng         Yourself :P                     urlLink  Free polls from Pollhost.com
