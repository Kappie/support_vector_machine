AND FINALLY, NEW EARPHONES!!! but they are quite hard to put on.. but wad the heck eh..  quite frustrated with this week's survivor, cuz its jus a recap.. and last wk, they put the commercial of the next week of survivor rather than this week...   but how can you blame them? are the commercials supposed to tell you: "And on this week, its the recaps of the previous episodes, even so, we would  still  lyk you to watch it."   Cuz not rite? but its their job to keep their own bread. Considering the difficulty, i would still wanna go to mass communications if im in a poly...   Im gud at talking, so.. its the ideal job.. i hope i get a gud salary and stuff.. otherwise, i dunno how i shld live on as "The big spender"..  well.. my language a lil' weird today, cuz im basically not talking abt wad i've done.. i alwiz get misled... so.. oh, why the fuck shld i bother explaining, rite?
