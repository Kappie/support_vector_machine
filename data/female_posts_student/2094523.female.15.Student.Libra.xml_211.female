Friends will never be friends, everything is built upon lies and more lies. its the harsh reality of this world. Just when you think magybe this time just this time you can hope to hold on to what you have.. you eventually lose everything and you are back where you started from. the only thing that mattered, the only thing that kept you grounded, the only thign you ever believed in, the only thing you had..is gone.. what do i have have left for me? "something beautiful is dead"    'Cause You Wanted More More Than I could Give More than I could handle In a life that I can't live You wanted more More than I could bear More than I could offer For a love that isn't there  -TONIC
