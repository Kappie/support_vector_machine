I take that to heart when I meet someone new, but sometimes, I let myself go and trust completely and love wholeheartedly anyway.  And sometimes it is truly worth it.  What's great is when I meet someone who thinks the same way!   urlLink Rich Villar  is a good friend of mine.  Sure, I haven't known him long, but that doesn't matter.  As  urlLink Fish  stated last night, "This guy right here has enough heart to fill this room" and its completely true.  He will out-love the best of them and his devotion and conviction is unwaivering.  He is truly a man to love.  To admire.  Someone that everyone should try and emulate but will never quite get just as right as he has it. (except Steve, of course ;-))  I had never seen him on stage before and last night at  urlLink Acentos  he didn't disappoint.  Everyone in the room was hootin' and hollerin' for him, and deservedly so.  The guy can write a poem sitting at a traffic light!  And it will actually be good!!  He's so multifaceted it would take a lifetime to truly get to know him in his entirety...and that's alright by me.  But all poetry aside, I love the guy because as much as he's got going on in his head, he will always be there for someone HE calls a friend...even if some don't deserve it.  As another friend always says in regards to her devotion to me, "I'm never too far from petty."  Meaning, I'm always on YOUR side.    Rich, I'm never too far from petty for you.   Congratulations on a wonderful evening!  You were great!  :-)
