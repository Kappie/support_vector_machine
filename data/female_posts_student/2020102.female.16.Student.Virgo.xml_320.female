Marc: I'm the big word brain guy? Brittany: You know what I mean, you're like a dictionary. (pause) No wait! I didn't mean that! Marc: (referring to a time when she called him a computer) Oh, so I'm not a machine now, I'm a book that can be open and closed and PUT AWAY? Brittany: NO! I didn't mean that... Marc: (to Matt) Guess what? I'm the big word brain guy. It sounds like a Sesame Street character.   Ms. Overton: I'm only turning 25. My birthday is next Thursday... April 20th. John: That's Hitler's birthday. Brandon Trussler: That explains a lot. Brandon Townsley: She's only turning 25, Oz! You still have a chance! (FYI: Oz is the most annoying kid in the class and he happens to sit at my table.)
