When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or  do  things my own way, they call me a bitch.   Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in  my heart. It means I live my life MY way. It  means I won't allow anyone to step on me.   When I refuse to tolerate injustice and  speak against it, I am defined as a bitch.   The same thing happens when I take time for  myself instead of being everyone's maid.     It means I have the courage and strength to  allow myself to be who I truly am and won't  become anyon e else's idea of what  they think I "should" be.   I am outspoken, opinionated and determined.  I want what I want and there is  nothing wrong with that!   So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner  flame,  try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold  within me. You won't succeed. And if  that makes me a bitch, so be it.   I embrace the title and am proud to bear it !!!!
