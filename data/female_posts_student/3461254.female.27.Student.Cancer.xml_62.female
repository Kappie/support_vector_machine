Purchased in one pound increments and cooked until crispy on the George Foreman Grill; fat and drippings saved to use as suet for the birds in the winter.  Geez!  I have such an incredible craving for this wonder meat!!!  And now for something completely different.  This past holiday weekend was quite nice.     Friday --spent with Kate at home.  We went shopping at Marshal's, then spilt an appetizer sampler plate at Pizzeria Uno.  Fun greasy stuff.  Saturday --Hung out at home for a while, returned to my place, cleaned, ran errands, shopped, watched movies and read.  Sunday --Cleaned house and made Rice Krispie Treats.  My friend Penny had a fireworks party, so I introduced M. to everyone.  Good food.  Deep Fried Turkey!  Monday --Helped M. plant several shrubs in his backyard.  Then we had La Shish.  Yum!  After sweating and getting filthy and dift covered, he said I still smelled nice.  Awwww.
