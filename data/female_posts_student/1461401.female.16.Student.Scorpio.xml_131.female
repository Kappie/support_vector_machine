       
      you and me, at Midnight Down. standing by the Rever's Edge, watching it Rush. just you and me Sleepy Head, my Funny Bunny. yes, i said, i am your Girlfriend. just you and me. waiting for the Crazy Sunshine, and I Think I Can see the Hybrid Rainbow. it really is a Beautiful Morning With You. you and me can Ride On Shooting Star, and never Come Down. our hearts beating together make Instant Music, living our One Life in our own Bran-New Lovesong.    it really would be a beautiful morning with you, but you're never around anymore.
