Mark Pazuhanich was sentenced to 10 years probation and must register as a sex offender. He tearfully said in court that he would resign his Monroe County judgeship. Pazuhanich blamed his problems on alcohol and medication.   The victim testified at a hearing in January that Pazuhanich touched her inappropriately throughout the Hilary Duff concert on Nov. 29, several weeks after he was elected to the bench.   Pazuhanich pleaded no contest to two counts of indecent assault, one count of endangering the welfare of a child and one count of corruption of minors.   Earlier, a judge suspended Pazuhanich's visitation rights with his daughter, who lives with her mother in New Jersey and attended the concert with him. As part of Monday's settlement, Pazuhanich must stay away from his daughter unless the visit is supervised and approved by the court.    Now, isn't it nice that people can use alcohol and drugs as an excuse?  This is ridiculous. Makes me want to puke.  On another happy note, seems as though the infamous  urlLink Kobe Bryant  doesn't want cameras in the court room for his rape trial.  Too bad, I wanted to see his face again before he gets screwed, just like he did in D-Town.    {sidenote} I really doubt that Mr.Bryant will get any stiff fines or jail time for his actions, but I do have something for him.  For all the good men out there, wherever you are, don't take this as an insult, rather, take it as a Fuck You Kobe.     Ah, excuse me Mr.  Do you have the time?
