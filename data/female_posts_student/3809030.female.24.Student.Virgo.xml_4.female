I definitely have to say, Dr. Laura's book has changed my life forever. I don't think I will ever look at my husband the same way. Man, I sound like some infomercial!! haha...   Anyways,we met up with the gang last night for dinner at Pepe's. The food wasn't that good, actually, it wasn't good at all! However, the company was good. We had fun just mingling with everyone. At times like this, I am grateful to have such great people as friends.We are getting together tomorrow night for "GAME NIGHT." How fun is that!! We are gonna playMafia, Cranium, Jenga, and a whole bunch of other games! We'regonna have pizza and beer.... The perfect combo! Yummy yummy for my tummy! *slurp*   Ooohhhhh!!!! I can't wait any longer.....Melissa is due any day now, and we are just here waiting! WAITING!! They narrowed the named down to Brendan and Ryan. I really like the name Brendan.Of all the names they had chosen, I had picked Brendan and Tyler. I want a BABY!!:( Oh well, in due time..... What am I talking about. I can barely survive school as it is. Steve (my brother in-laws, brother) is flying in tomorrow from Seattle to see the baby's arrival. How sweet is that! I doubt my brother would do that for me.   I have to go study now. I'm just sitting here lagging so that Idon't have to study. I have two exams left, one on Monday and one on Wednesday! Then I am done withsummer school baby!
