Usually I start getting panicky, thinking some bug has got into my computer and changes the English language to tribe-geeky language; only to remember I downloaded the damn thing in German. I then bravefully proceed to attempt to translate the german words and try real hard to understand the intructions without refering to a translator.  But of course, anyone is capable of doing this as the google toolbar isn't exactly for rocket-scientist IQ capacity only. And it wasn't like I never had it in English before.  But that's besides the point!  I feel proud. And it's a goddamn start. Sooner or later, I'd be reading and understanding TV manuals in german and we'll see who has the last laugh then. Suckers! And then when I finally began to start reciting Goethe in his mother-tongue and have a masters in Deutsch, you all shall see how powerful the german google taskbar was and how much of an impact it had on my life. YEAH!   I overdid it with dinner to night. 3 hours of stuffing your face with steamboat cannot have good side-effects in the diet zone. And the fact that I've decided I don't need to work-out this week because I did it everyday last week is just not good either. Why doesn't it get to my head that this exercise thing is a long-term routine and not some one night fling? I have no idea.  Maybe when I hitch up a size - it might finally slap me in the face and I'll FINALLY stop reaching for the damn junk food and my chocolate bars and those damn Uncle Toby's cookie and cream granola bars. These things are evil.  Tomorrow I'll make miniature red horns and stick them on all the junk food in the house as a reminder. That should scare me off abit. After that, I shall stick a naked picture of Angelina Jolie as my sole-motivator for my exercise regime 128734292374th attempt and hopefully this time, it will be sucessful. Exercise God, gimme strength! Gimme the strength you've blessed, Big(Moderate)Ben. Please please please.   It's 12:15 and I'm looking for a printable size picture of the Borneo Island because I am my sister's project/printer person for her schoolwork. It's not as easy as it seems. And it's a waste of time. But I rather work my baby Greg then let her have her hands on my baby. She screws him up so badly and leaves him sore. She's awful.  After this, I shall lounge around and await the very much anticipated Euro2004 finals. I have no idea who's going to win and I'm not on anyone's side (though I should be rooting for Portugal) - but I guess that's what makes it all the bit more exciting. Let's hope its a super duper match. With penalties! because penalties rule! AND some shirt exchanges in the end. TOPLESS FOOTBALLER MACHO MEN!! yum yum!
