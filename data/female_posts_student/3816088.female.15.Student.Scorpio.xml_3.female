So we went to Maegans for a while and just like hung out in her room and did a little "cleaning up" haha ::snip snip:: and then the shutter guy came in to hang her shutters so we left and went to Benjis so he could change into his basketball clothes...he was pimpin!! We picked out his clothes and everything and it all matched down to the shoes and socks and everything. Then afterards we headed to Chelsmes and hung out there and finished "cleaning up" there. So now if you are wondering everything is nice and clean. after that we went to bens basketball games which were just at the church and when he was done playing we all took one of his jerseys and since i had the like undershirt one we had to change shirts and man it looked hot on him.lol so then we headed to maegans and we all just layed in her bed until like 11:30 and thats when we all cleared out so he would meet curfew.  i am telling you this had to be the MOSTFUN day ever!! I was soo sad when it ended. :'(  i love you guys!! heather
