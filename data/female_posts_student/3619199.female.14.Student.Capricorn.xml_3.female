Maybe it's extremely annoying, but  offensive  sounds like a pretty strong word.  One person actually emailed me (when my email address was open to the public), and told me that a comment I made on their blog actually  offended  them. But how can that be? I just joked around and suggested "therapy", no big deal right? Well, apparentley it is. I think what's offensive, and what's not, is pretty much subjective.  It's all really in opinion. Maybe the solution to this situation, is for me to stop commenting on blogs altogether. Fat Chance. I don't get why everyone is so uptight. I mean it was just a joke for god sakes (not a funny one, but a joke none the less). If the person I "offended" would just take the screw driver out of his ass, maybe he wouldn't have been so offended. Plus you can trash comments if you want to, just click the handy dandy garbage can, and BOOM it's gone! The point is this: I'm annoying, silly, and usually bored, so get used to my so called offensive comments. No blog is safe when I'm around, you might be my next victim (but I wouldn't lose to much sleep over it) I'm really not like this in my everyday life. I'm actually very introverted (it's always the quiet ones). Plus this is the friggin internet we're talkin' about here, you guys have to expect this kind of thing. I know blogs aren't meant for people's silly or "unwanted" comments, they are meant for thoughts, ideas, rants and raves. But who really cares. If you have a comment box, you should expect dumb comments. This is the human race we are talkin' about, there's stupid people! I just so happen to be one of them! So to make a pointless post more pointless, I'm not going away anytime soon, so you people can do one of three things 1. Get The Hell Over It 2. Ignore it all together (not that hard) or 3. Just Go FUCK YOURSELVES! (i think most people would prefer the first two choices, but I'm sure some people wouldn't mind doing that last one) Chow for now
