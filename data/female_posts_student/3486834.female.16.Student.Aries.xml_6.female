I just walk  away.. I still miss everyone. I need to get Paxton a gift for his birthday while I am out of town. Everyone is saying that I'm missing a lot. Emily got like a a foot cut off of her hair.. That's like.. WOAH! But it is just to her shoulders or something. Amanda wanted me to do something with her Wednesday. She said that we coiuld go surfing or something!! WOOHOO! That would be so cool! I am soo bored right now.. My mother is getting on my nerves.. She won't stop talking about moving.. I do NOT want to move! And she started asking me what college I wanted to go to. She says that I should go somewhere in Europe. Hah.. yeah right. And this stupid GAP thingy. I really did not want to be in GAP! I told my mom and everything, but she said that she was gunna make me. Mrs. Burns even told the parents not to force the child. I feel some forcing going on.. *rolls eyes*..  I need someone to make me laugh or something. I was soo grossed out at dinner.. I don't know how the subject came up but everyone started talking about women getting their tubes tied.. i mean how nasty is that. me and gary had to put our foot or feet down.. so we tried to chane the subject.. i already have enough nightmares. It's not as if gage gave me enough.. All I did was start talking about marrying allen iverson.. and then he said that he will be all wrinkly and take viagra.. EWW! That's just not something that I wanted to think about.
