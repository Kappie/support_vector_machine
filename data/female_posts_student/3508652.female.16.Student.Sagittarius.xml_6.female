Sad, lonely, worthless, hungry but don’t feel like eating, tired, melancholy… yeah, that’s me. Well, I have decided that I’m going to ask my mom to take me to get tested to see if I am bipolar to any degree, and I’m really dreading that. It’s gonna suck. My anticipated response from her will be, “You’re not bipolar, Lydia, you’re just miserable all the time, and you need to go to counseling for that.” Ha! I just came up with a counterattack for that! “Mom, I’m NOT always miserable, sometimes I’m floating on Cloud 9 – that sounds like bipolar to me.” Someone advised me not to trust the internet, but I took an online quiz two times, and the second time I had different answers, thinking that I’d come out with something like, “you are somewhat depressed”, but it still said I was bipolar! I don’t understand – one question was, “What are your symptoms [of depression]?” and they had like 3 answers that were unmistakably bipolar – answers like, “elevated elation at times, and other times paralyzing despair”. I don’t remember the other 2 answers, but they were very similar to that one – mood swings of happiness vs. depression. Another question asked, “Have you lost interest in everyday activities?” and the answer that sounded the most like me was, “at times I feel like I don’t care about anything or anyone. Other times I’m on top of the world and can do anything.” That’s DEFINITELY bipolar. :( I remember one Saturday I was totally depressed, and was really contemplating suicide. Two days later, I was having such a great day… and both were for no reason at all. Like that person said, I won’t place my trust in an online quiz, I’ll wait for results from a professional, but things don’t look good. That makes me depressed. I’ve taken pride in being a “normal” person – no genetic disorders, no missing fingers or toes or anything, I’m not blind or deaf… I don’t even have to wear glasses! So if I am bipolar, I’m not “normal” anymore cuz I’ll have a mental disorder. So what if several million Americans suffer from being bipolar? It’s only 1.2%, and highly the minority. I suppose it’s cool to be different, but not with something like this.   Current Mood: mildly depressed Current Music: Eminem - Lose Yourself
