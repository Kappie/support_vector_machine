Then we played lots of XBox games which was nice cause I don't own many and plus I hardly ever have time to play.  We also watched Finding Nemo and got Hawaiian pizza for dinner.  Though I was still hungry after so I also had a bowl of cereal and some crackers with peanut butter.  I think I am growing or something, cause lately I have been one to just down food and the numbers on the scale are slightly going down though I keep eating like a hulk.  I miss having Chem, but I know lots of people dropping 30.  Scary, scary, thought.  I guess I am not them though and I shouldn't be too concerned if I am not taking chem til' next year, but of course I am going to be a bit worried.  I am doing a lot better in Bio, then I did in Chem though.  The biochemistry stuff we are doing now is so interesting and it seems simple because I learned lots of the stuff in Chem so it's not the difficult.  I want to try do really good on the next quiz and I know I can get an 80% on the unit test.  I want to prove to myself and the world that I am cabable of such things.  I haven't failed anything in Bio yet.  I came close on the nitro/phos quiz, but I thought it was extremely hard.  Now that I have been stressed last semester, now that I have done Chem, it seems to be paying off.   Chemistry + Being stressed out -------> A good and hardworking Bio student     My goals right now are:  -Score 100% or close to in on the next Bio quiz, because I CAN -Get 80% on the Bio unit test -Finish memorizing my lines for the play -Try to pass my English reading comp because it's hard but I CAN do it -Be a better person, nicer, kinder, wiser -Eat healthy so I can loose some more weight
