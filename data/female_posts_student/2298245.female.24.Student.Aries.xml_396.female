So I'm a slow learner ...)    Do the morons in Old Media suppose that when Reagan was elected in 1980 (and re-elected in 1984) that voters didn't know he was a conservative? We don't elect people to lead us anywhere; we vote to inform those who would lead us as to what we want and heaven help them if they don't deliver.  The US electorate chose a conservative candidate because they approved of fiscal responsibility, a strong defense and had no intention of losing the Cold War.  The voters of the USA led the nation to the right, not Ronald Reagan. Sorry to bust your delusions, CNN, but there is help: try enrolling in a remedial Civic course.   There is one difference, of course:  I was complaining about the left, and she is complaining about the media.  But that is such a negligible difference that it nearly amounts to a non-difference.  And while I'm not one to buy into conspiracies, of either the left wing or right wing variety, the story I read that got my dander up was  urlLink this one , from none other than CNN.    Coincidence?
