       
      I am sitting right above you, but you don't know I'm there.  I stare at you Boldly Across the way Knowing that you will not look mine That you will not notice That you do not know I exist. And if you did happen to glance my way I'd look down, or over, or anywhere else, Just to not be caught up in your stare, Just to avoid your attention, Just to stay away, Even though that is the last thing I want.  I peer over the rail And down upon you where you sit below Your back to me so it's truly safe And I wish I were next to you. Or even that you'd just turn And look up And you'd see me and smile And I'd somehow find the courage to smile back. But of all these possibilities The last is the least likely. Because I am hopelessly, consistently afraid. So I stop my peering And return to whatever it is I should be doing, Doing my best to ignore the distraction The nagging image of you In my mind Sitting below, And I know that before I leave I will stoop to peer down on you yet again And hope that you turn and see, But praying even more that you don't.  This is my torment, My punishment for some unknown evil deed, That I should want constantly to know you, Hope constantly to see you, And yet be frozen by fear, contrained by some unknown force From ever so doing. The most I will ever do is see you. I will never know you.
