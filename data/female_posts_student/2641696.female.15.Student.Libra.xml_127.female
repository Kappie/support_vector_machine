Nope, it was all those stupid DareARTS stories. Grr! I have a blue rabbit called Blue, a dormouse called Dora and a duckling called Bernie so far. Stupid stupid stupid. I've finished two stories, on my second. That means I've got 7 more to go, including the unfinished one. *sigh* And then, I've got to  rewrite  all these stories for  teenagers . Ahhh! *dies*   They're advertising a job position in the Blogger News thing. That sounds cool. I've always liked how Blogger is friendly and funny and stuff, not all serious. Google sounds like a good company. Of course, I'm sure it's all a sham. I'll bet Google and Starbucks hook up to take over the world. Think they could? Hey, are private armies illegal?   I think that's what I'd do if I ever won the lottery. Buy a private army. Then I'd be like a world power without land. It'd be like my Rise of Nations game all over again :D w00t! That's a good game. I should probably go play it, since I'm bored, and my fingers hurt. This is a hint: never, ever type 6000 words straight. It is painful. I can feel my knuckles loosening as they prepare to fly away even now. *sigh* BLAH!   Oh, and my parents are snoopy :D That's about it. Okeedoke, done. Byee!
