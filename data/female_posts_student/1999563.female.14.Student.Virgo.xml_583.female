Its like Dove extra volume and its in a can and it comes out FOAMY! It rocks. I think someone is using my shaving cream. Haha. Its like almost gone and I just bought it!   Then I blow dryed my hair and made it look pretty. Then I put on make-up which was fun. I don't know why but I love to put on make-up. Then I watched the olympic diving trials. Those are so cool! I wish I could dive like that. Its simply amazing.  I love the olympics, so fun!! :)  Now I am just being lazy and sitting. I love it!  I haven't been able to realy relax for a really long time. I am always so busy with school and life.   Even though it hasn't really started, I never want summer to end.
