Or the joy of cold water, or just getting to sit down for a second. I guess heavy, steel toed boots, miles of concrete  hours on your feet will do that to you. Its strange to watch when the lunch whistle blows....Suddenly it seems like all over the plant there is a sigh of relief  you watch as the men take off their hard hats  goggles, sit down  begin to dig into their cooler. Or to watch as about a dozen grown men crowd around a portable lunch stand that they set up every day at noon, like kids around an ice cream truck.   Another great joy is to be out on the shop floor when the shift whistle blows. You watch as the day shift guys practically run out of the shop  watch the new guys slowly venture over to man their work stations. Its almost as though these daily cycles remind one to enjoy their freedom  the moments that they truly own.  Often when I come home I am too tired to do anything but sleep. Its only now that I am beginning to get used to the cycle  actually do stuff after work.    I watch these men as they work, some I find are more educated than others. Some are more inviting  some are wary of my presence. You see, I stop and ask these guys about their jobs.  They stand there and explain it to me, each in their own way. Sometimes they ask me more questions than I get to ask them. The bottom line is I am there to figure out when  where things go wrong  who is responsible. Mostly to fix the problems  train the men. Unfortunately, the information that I rely to the higher up is not always used in constructive ways.  Often, it results in a misplaced reprimand....when the bosses are usually the ones who are to blame because they haven't taken the time to thoroughly explain what is expected of the worker.  It was very hard today when I was talking to a guy in shipping, he explained to me that most people are afraid to talk, because this is their livelihood and they have a family to take care of. That is something that I respect and I don't want to endanger that. But the truth is that I still have to be there and do my job and all that I can do is appreciate the time spent  try to make it a better place.
