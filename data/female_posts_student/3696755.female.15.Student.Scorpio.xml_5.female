My name is Ally and i live in El Paso Tx and im a jr at Franklin High School. Thats your first warning, im a girl in high school, there wil be drama. I try my hardest to get away from the drama but its kinda hard when thats all there is. I live with my parents, 2 cats, a dog, and i have a 23 year old borhter who goes to Texas State. I have a lot of frineds. Like, Lisa, Kelly, Jerad, Jaesek, Trey, Jd, Lindsey, there are many more but those will be the ones you hear about the most im sure. I have guy problems, that im sure youll hear me bitch about often. Guys and i.....i dunno its hard to explain, it can be really really good, or not. Its confussing, yes guys, you are confussing too. Well thats just scraping the surface but itll give u a little idea of what to expect.
