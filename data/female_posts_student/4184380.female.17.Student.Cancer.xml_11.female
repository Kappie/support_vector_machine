However, this has become my summer employment and I really do like it... I do... but sometimes you kind of just want to sit the kids in their own separate rooms to keep as much possible space between them as possible, and then crank your headphones to the tune of the Killers or something.       Lucky  enough for me, tonight they're going to the Mariner's game with their parental units and so their mom left me with instructions to just basically let them veg out. I dont know if there is a harder task than entertaining a 6 and 9 year old together. Nothing holds their attention span beyond 15 minutes or so. If I'm lucky. Gossshh..    Ok last night I saw King Arthur. (I know that technically I'm supposed to put that title in italics since its a movie but I dont feel like it so just deal.) Personally I thought that it was a movie that I could only watch once and that would be the end of it. I wanted to go home halfway through! Well actually I just wanted to go somewhere else with Andy my bf because we hadnt gotten to see each other hardly and there we were sitting in a movie theater.       It really was kind of a boring movie though. My mom kept telling me on the car ride home how hot the guy that plays Arthur is, but I think that he looked a lot like Mel Gibson. Cool eyes, but I dont really see myself going for the warrior 'I'm willing to sacrifice my life' kind of guy. Thats probably why I will never date anyone in the US armed forces. Call me a horrible person but that's just what I think.       So we get to the movie and we go with my family (which I can tell Andy isnt too hot with to begin with) and then Marie and Emily find some spots to sit right in front of us. Which actually I didnt mind in the least. Andy kept throwing popcorn at them though. Ooops~!~ Time for a character list~!!!    Cast List-- (in order of their appearance thus far)       - Andy-- my boyfriend. Red head, tall, funny smart guy who shares my love for thrift store shopping. Well, and other loves of mine also, but that's one of the many. We've been dating just short of a month so far but it sure doesnt feel like its been that long. Time flies when you're having fun ;) I'll have plenty to blog about Andy I'm sure.       - Emily--  another red headed friend of mine. Im outnumbered right now!! AHHH. Her 18th birthday is today- I wish her a good one. She's leaving for her freshman year at Willamette College in Salem Oregon really soon and that makes many of us on the island sad. :( But I will make sure to visit her at least a few times. :) She is very politically minded and pissed about Bush like we all should be, and she just returned from Finland which really seems to me like her true home. She's already planning her return during her winter break from Willamette.       - Marie-- yay now I'm not outnumbered-- Marie is not a fiery redhead but a very very very blonde, blonde. But not in any permanent mental ways that I am yet aware of. She's a great friend and is much fun to talk to about shopping, shoes, movies, politics and other things.       Ok so that's who has appeared in my 'saga' so far.     In the background the music of Fantasia cycles... Sometimes you wonder about little kids and how music really affects their 'growth.' In band they've always told us that it promotes more complex brain growth and development but perhaps that was so they could keep us (well more like have our parents keep us) in the class. There are a lot of other kids that I know that are amazingly smart that do not know how to play any instrument at all.     Which has reminded me that Andy plays the guitar. *sighs* hehe. :)    It's amazing how fast my weeks fill up with an 'agenda.' Today and tomorrow I babysit until 4 and then on Thursday I think I am going to hang out with my friend Cassidy (oops another one to add to the list... hold on) and then on Friday I am 'escorting' my mom up to Oak Harbor so that when she turns in her car to be worked on at the dealer's, she has a car to be 'transported' around in. Which is kind of good for me anyways since last time I was transporting them all around we went to Wallmart and I bought the wrong make up. Bleh!~ So that's probably what I'm going to have to do this time also.    Hm... maybe Andy could go with us.. I dont know if he'd like to be subjected to that kind of torture though. -- He'd have to deal with my family all day-- and part of that day may be spent at an Outlet Mall. Which are my favorite type, but my mom seems to be convinced that I wont EVER pick out shirts or pants with my boyfriend within a 10 mile radius or something. The logic behind that... I'm not sure of.    Saturday is my day so far that I am trying with all my might to keep open so that I may hang out with Andy... and Sunday I am going to be the friend Scott's 'date' to his Fireman Picnic or something. He's another one for the list...    Updated Cast List:       - Cassidy-- a friend of mine who is also leaving for college this year--- only he's attending Evergreen State College. He's rather a new friend of mine-- and I havent seen him in about a month because we've both been so busy... he's got a cool Volvo that I love, and he's a cool guy that has tons of interests. I think that's one of the things that amazes me about him-- the amount of interests he HAS. Everything from swords to the prices of 'vagina dolls' on the internet (if anyone is wondering they go for about $300-$400 each) It's astounding.       - Scott-- He will be a fellow senior whom I have known since 8th grade. He grew up on the east coast and I truly believe that he probably does belong there permanently. He gets "east coast cravings." Which I cannot understand as I have never been there in my life. He plays the trumpet and loves Jazz... he's got tons of interests too like languages, religions, and Guinness.    Well I think thats about all I should write for now--- see what happens when I'm bored? Damn typing skills keep me from thinking about things too much before I type them. :P Anyways-- hope you all are having a wonderful day. :)
