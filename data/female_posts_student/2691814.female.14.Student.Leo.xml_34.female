History was soo easy all we did was watch more of the Civil Rights Movement. lol Quite boring if you ask me i think it just causes more controversy at our school. im not getting into that right now. In chorus I found out were singing an actually good song. It's very pretty and we have some great harmonies and stuff going on. I'm feeling better today...i still can't hear very well. Math was pretty funny tho. Everytime mrs.daniels would call on Ryan and Tom they would be totally clueless cuz we're talkin and stuff. luckily she didn't call on me or anything cuz I had no idea what was goin on lol. OMG and Mr. Hunts hair today was just so funny cuz me and Ryan were talkin about it yesterday, and today it just made me crack up lol.     Gosh and I hated the bus ride home although it was kinda funny. First off, the sub.bus driver just cranked up the volume on one of these rap songs. It was...Eminem..and guess who got up and started rapping...Jeremy of course. Omg he's such a wannabee. I can't STAND him. Then one of MY favorite songs comes on and then he starts sing...now that got me really mad lol. But anyway...after francesca left Jeremy started flirtin with Cindy...like he has the slightest chance with her. She hates him too! I don't know....I might be alil overdramatic today lol. Just being myself.    Okay and I need to find out what time that skate competition at Vans starts. Ryan-if you read this let me know.
