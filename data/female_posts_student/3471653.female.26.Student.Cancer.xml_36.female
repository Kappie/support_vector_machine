So expect me to go ABD (all but dissertation) in March or April of 2005.  This will give me more time to work on preliminary dissertation work, grant writing, and conference papers.  So, when I finally go ABD, I should be farther along on my dissertation.  And now it just occurred to me that this change in schedule matters to none and makes sense to few.
