Usually those people are people that already know you.  Since they already know you, and because it IS a journal after all, shouldn't it then be GIVEN that your blog be honest at all times?  I mean, what the fuck, right?   Now, let me clarify: One can CHOOSE to be cryptic about something that happened, not name names, or even as  urlLink Oscar  did recently, make mention of stuff that you are writing in another journal and not talk about it on this one.  That is FINE with me!  Don't give us your business.  It's your prerogative.  Talk about trivial shit, what do I care?  As long as you're talking/writing, it's great!  BUT don't start writing shit that  SOME  people know is complete and utter BULLSHIT and play it off like it's truth.  Don't play this 'woe is me, give me some love shit' when you know you fucking had it and couldn't HANDLE it.  Don't try and evoke some sympathy from others when it's all your own doing.    Now I'M being cryptic.  Hey, that's MY prerogative.  But at least I'm being honest.
