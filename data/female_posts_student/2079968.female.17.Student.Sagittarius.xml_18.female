Freedom is sweet.  I found really cool t-shirts online...won't post the site b/c i'm too lazy...  But one was a Davey and Goliath tee...want for b-day or Christmas...it's cool...also found muppets/fraggle rock tees and other various cartoons or tv show tees...  I am hungry! I want something really good...like...hot fudge cake...mmm...
