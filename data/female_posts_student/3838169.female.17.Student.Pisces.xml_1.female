(Everyone is really happy with me because i'm kind of a shoe slut...so now i'm down to 60 pairs!!)  i should so have my own reality tv show.  i think i came up with the concept like 10 years ago.  when i was little i swore that there were cameras following me around...i used to act for the 'cameras'....and i know that i would have a way fucking better show than these loonies on the tube.  my life is a soap opera.    ugh, i don't really wanna clean my room.  blah!!!!!!  so, anyway, i was zooming around all these other peoples blogs yesterday...and i noticed most of them were like video or photo journals.  i felt pretty left out.  because i'm just this old school online journal punk.  so since i don't have a scanner and my web camera is shitty...i made some pretty pictures on my paint thing.  but i can't get them to go on the page.  so i guess it was just a big waste of time.  maybe i'll ask for help or something.  i don't know.  i guess i don't have much to say right now.  i'm just rambling off stupid stuff. leave it to me.  i have to get up so early tomorrow for work.  ugh.  i'm out of my diet cherry 7up, which tastes like horse dung...but there is absolutely nothing to drink in this god forsaken house (all the good pop is in my dad's trunk...that selfish soda whore)  lol.  yeah, i can't believe i just wrote 'lol'.  i really need to go and shove my head in a bucket of water.  now there's this commerical about smores on.  i haven't had a smore in years.  i shoudl really do that sometime.  if i become uuber desperate i can do it in a microwave...but those never tasted the same.  in fact, when i would have babysitters be all like "you wanna make smores?!?!?!" and then i would get all excited...and then they'd just pop the shit into the microwave...i just remember being so let down.  i don't think i have the 3 ingredients anyway.  i'm going to go 'clean my room' (really watch more ashlee simpson...sit and seethe that i don't have my own damn tv show) hasta. matsen
