I started thinking about this after watching a strongbad email, check it out.  so, anyways today is fathers day and I got my dad the guiness book of world records, it's wicked cool.  one of the records kind of disappointed me; a man once ate 4 hot dogs in 3 minutes! what's great about that? seriously, someone break that record! I found i,Robot by Isaac Asimov at the book store today, wicked exciting, it looks wicked good.  I am gonna read the book then see the movie, it'll be great I tell you (it's also a summer reading list book). Seeing Troy got me to start reading The Iliad by Homer, I love it so much.  It's wicked different than the movie tho. They hardly even talk about how the whole helen thing came about.  Also, the timeline is all screwed up in the movie.  anyways I love the Iliad so far, I recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it already.  I'm also trying to get through That Hideous strength by C.S. Lewis, everything is leading up to something interesting but so far it hasn't happened yet. Its wicked tedious, hopefully not for long.  Tonight I think we are gonna watch U-571, my sister gave it to my dad for fathers day, it looks good.  I'll post again soon. BYE
