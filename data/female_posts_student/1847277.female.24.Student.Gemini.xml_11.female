I mean, there are probably six dozen other jobs (if not more) that I could do and make a much stronger/more important impact on the world.  I could be a doctor, a public interest lawyer, a secondary school teacher, a dentist, I could join the Peace Corps.  I could be a police or firewoman.  So why am I becoming an archaeologist?  Who am I really going to be able to help?  It makes me feel really selfish.
