The man was unnecessarily harsh, but it’s true that unless you get off on messes, food sex might not change your life. On the other hand, it’s a fun way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon! Why eat brunch off a plate when you can eat it off your main squeeze? Why eat grapes out of a bowl when you could be blindfolded and nipping them out of your lover’s teasing fingers?   My biggest helpful hint to you, dear reader, is to avoid getting sugar near any type of poon! Yeast loves sugar. Need I say more? No whipped cream or alcohol douches. Chocolate is pretty much out. And hold off on the banana unless it’s got a condom over it. In fact, your mom would tell you to wash/wrap any food you’re going to play with. Who wants pesticides up their ass?   I do think Saran Wrap would be a pretty sexy add-in for a food fiesta. Saran’s a pretty fun bondage tool (remember to have strong scissors handy—Saran knots are impossible to undo--and for God’s sake, NOT THE FACE), and it would keep you squeaky clean while your lover ate to their heart’s content.   You probably won’t want food straight out of the fridge unless you’re going for shock value. I HATE the cold. In my opinion, there could be nothing worse than sticking your dick into a freezing cold cantaloupe. If freezing’s your thing, you could try this DIY ice dildo: dangle a condom down over a paper towel tube, snap the top of the condom over the top of the tube and secure, fill it with water, and set carefully in your freezer. Unless you’ve got an enormous condom, this guy’s gonna be kind of skinny at the top. You could also use one of those make-your-own popsicle plastic moulds. Do let ice melt a bit for lubrication BEFORE you shove it anywhere too special. Remember that whole stick-your-tongue-to-the-freezing pole thing?   The heat is much more MY bag, so I recommend steaming your vegetables slightly (you still want them nice and firm, though, right?) and heating up your chocolate sauce. Remember to test the temperature on your wrist before you dump it all over your man’s balls. Safety first, people!   Finally, remember that you’re gonna have to EAT most of what you or your partner is wearing. So, three cans of whipped cream might sound fun in theory, but whipped cream gets awfully old when you’re munching away at nothing but.    10 sexy foods:        Cucumbers    Avocado     Strawberries    Wine    Peaches    Asparagus    Honey    Melon    Warm chocolate sauce     Ice
