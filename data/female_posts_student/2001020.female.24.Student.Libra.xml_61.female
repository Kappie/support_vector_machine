I mean, when did a guy think twice about a hookup and since when did he EVER think about it the next day in terms of, "Oh, I may have done something wrong"? Since when do men give a crap about a good friendship and how hooking up may not be good for it? I mean, when did this little conscience switch happen? Would someone please steer me away from men who think like that? This has happened to me twice now and I'm just about sick of it! I mean, I like a good boy as much as the next person, but when you're living 3000 miles away, a good hookup is in order! You can still have a friendship if you only hook up once a year! What the hell? This is utterly baffling to me. My other question is: am I just not good enough to date? All of these virtuous boys feel guilty for hooking up with me, but 1) they did it! and 2) why don't they like me enough to date me? I realize hookups don't usually turn into relationships but it's not like I am Stranger X. I know these boys, these boys know me, we have mutual respect for each other...so what's up with that? I realize I'm probably asking contradicting questions here...but both situations simply confuse me. Either let me be the girlfriend or the good hookup girl, but pick one and not neither!
