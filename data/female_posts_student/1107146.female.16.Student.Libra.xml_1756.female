I know this isn't any of my business, nor am I expecting someone, especially you, Linds, to get involved in any fashion, or more than you expect of yourself, rather, but it doesn't sound like this is safe being let alone. Speaking from familial experience (and I could go on for days, being more long-winded than I normally am...and  that's  an accomplishment), this kind of thing can continue and escalate until it's less a crisis and more a disaster.   But again, I'm only throwing down the seeds, not trying to cultivate a crop. Really, it seems well nigh impossible to actually do anything about the situation from here...I thought I should just bring it to the table and see what we all have to say about it.
