But the we faded, and they won 11-6.  I was catching way above my skill level.  There was this one that John (I think) threw.  It was about at my knee height and I was running in and I just stuck out my right hand and caught it!  I was in shock for a couple seconds before I turned around to throw it away.  Everyone was complimenting me on it after the game.  We went to John/Barrie/Liz's place after the game to have pizza, since it was Alex's last league game with us :(
