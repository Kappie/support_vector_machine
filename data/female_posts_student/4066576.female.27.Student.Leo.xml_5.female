Therefore, I couldn't go IAE for tutoring early. I had to walk from Finch station to Shapperd station for taking TTC subway. However, It didn't work at all even at Shapperd station. So, I and Jay went to the Finch station again to take a specially bus instead of Yonge subway. It took 2 hours to go IAE. Anyway, I met Ryan who is my tutor at York Mille station when I just got there by a specially bus.  I had tutoring at coffee shop in Eglinton with Ryan. We talked about some news from Metro and 24Hours and then Ryan read some articles which he prepared with his brother. It was so good like TOEFL test style. I hope he will bring these stuff for next tutoring. It will help me alot for improving my TOEFL score. After tutoring, I went to IAE again to pay for my tuition fee to  Omnicom as a TOEFL course. I had to pay about $953 for two months. The class will be started from 23th Aug. I have to wake up at least 7:00am. everyday from next week. The class will be so tough for me. I already mentioned about that the TOEFL course used to be so hard for me. It might be like that. However, I wish that is not so difficult. I will study from wed. at public library which is at Yonge  Bloor. For tomorrow, I will watch three videos which were rent from Eglinton library. And then from wed, I will study TOEFL and reading a book, Briget Johnson's diary second edition at Yonge  Bloor public library.  Now, I am drunken because I drank a bottle of beer at home after visiting Hazel's house.I am so tired now. Maybe because of beer. Anyway, The better way is that I should go to bed right now. I will write my diary tomorrow again.
