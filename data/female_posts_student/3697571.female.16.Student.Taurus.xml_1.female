I would never commit suicide but sometimes u cant help it b/c i know death is not an answer to ur problems! But yea so i just started praying.. and man ive just been so depressed! So please keep me and my family in yalls prayers! Then today i was with my dad and i almost broke my ankle! So yea and it hurts like a beast! I dont even want to know what it feels like to actually brake it!Then my mom came home today upset.. she heard that a friend of ours Jeff..is a moocher and i hope he doesnt try to come move in with us cause man he makesm e feel uncomfortable..and i could neverl ive in the same house as him and my mom said this is our home and he is not moving in so thats a relief...but it just seems that everything is going wrong right now i just dont even know what to think anymore... ive been so stressed out!Then ontop of that some stuff has been happening to my best friend and that is makin me real upset... and i just dont even want to get up in the morning anymore, im just scared of what new stuff ill learn about. I dont want my fmaily goin through the crap that i had to go through thats all i know. when i was little my dad used to beat the crap out of my mom...and he used to get drunk all the time..and that has seriously ruined me..i dont trust many guys...and i always dream about the times my dad beat my mom up right in front of me.. and the sad thing is my dad doesnt even remember ever doin that! But my dad is so much better now ...but theres always that fear that that might happen to me someday! I guess thats one of the reasons i havent had a boyfriend either! and i so agree with gabbywhen she says i wish i could win the lottery.. there is so much stuff i need.. i need a car...i need a cell phone.. i need clothes.. theres so much stuff....Idk i just cant wait to get married and have my own family..but yeathats kinda of what ive ben think about today and what all happened!
