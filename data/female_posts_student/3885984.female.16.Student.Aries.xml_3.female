This is actually kind of weird for me because my poetry days were way back in 7th grade, and so I wasn't sure if I still had it in me! Here ya go ...   .:.Who I Wanna Be.:.  Here I am, this is me. I'm only mortal, only what you see.  I'm not a super hero, I can't save you. I'm not an angel from above, I can't make miracles come true.  I'm not a model for perfection, I've had many regrets. I'm hardly ever actually right, I've never won a bet.  I've always been optimistic, I won't give up on what I believe in. I've always been a fighter, I won't back down until I win.  So, here I am, this is me. I might just be one in a crowd, but yeah, this is who I wanna be. ***  Do you like it? I'm not the best poet in the world, and whenever I do try to write a poem it always takes me forever! Well, I'll type again before I leave for vacation. I'm kind of hoping I'll have things to do before then - I hate it when summer gets boring! LOL JKM - OUT!
