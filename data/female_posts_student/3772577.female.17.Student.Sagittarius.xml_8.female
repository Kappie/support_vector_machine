This is alien to me. Before I was just a happy kid, following my dad around or sitting with my mom as she sewed. Or I would play by myself. Then there was always  urlLink The Horse  that I could be with. The only  urlLink friend  and company that I needed. And then there was Mthis past year. Now as I have neither of these two loves I find that I crave the company of groups of peers. I want to be doing something. I want to go to parties, I want to, in the fall, look back and remember good times with the gang. It's strange becuase I have never missed that. But today I saw all these people going everywhere, hanging out at the park, riding their bikes to...anywhere, cruising around in the car; I miss that.   Anyway, enough of that. What else is there to say. We got our tickets for the trip to Ireland in August. Exciting. Hopefulling everything thing willbe wonderful.   I wrote another poem the other day. I just need a title for it. Don't know about taht yet. I'll post it up here tomorrow, well today in a minute.   Sorry about the links, they're just personal pain reminders, meant for nothing other than, "look what you don't have anymore" stupidity.    I am very tired.
