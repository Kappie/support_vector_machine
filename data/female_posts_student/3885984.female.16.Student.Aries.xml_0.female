We actuallycame back a day earlier than we had expected to because well,   one   that stupid little light on the car cameon again,   two   I wasn't feeling that well and   three  , I actually kind of wanted to come home! I did have an amazing time though, so that's all that really matters.   Once I arrived in Panama City, I decided to write down some notes so then I'd know what to type on here once I got back home. Yes, I am a dork, but I'm okay with that! LOL Here ya go ...     Day One    We got lost a lot, and I did get a little car sick, (I never knew that I was the type to get car sick!)but Panama City was beautiful and our hotel was right on the bay. Plus, the air conditioning was like heaven by the time that we got there, and there was cable TV! Yeah, life was good. We even found an O'Charley's which is like my  FAVORTIE  restaurant!     Day Two    We went to this place in Panama City called Gulf World, (it's a marine park) and it was so much fun! They had shows with dolphins, sea lions and parrots that were hilarious! They also had other shows and ALL of them were amazing! If you ever go to Panama City, you  must  go there!We also found the Salty Dog Surf Shop, and I got one of their famous T-Shirts. We checked out the bay at the hotel, and believe me, the view was breathtaking! I've never seen so many palm trees in my life! haha And oh yeah, we eventually figured out that we were in the central time zone and not the eastern anymore. I changed my watch, but Grams wouldn't do it so it kind of got a little confusing! LOL Oh yeah, whether it was a road sign, a store or even a person, I was reminded of all of my friends from back home. ::tear:: I missed you guys!     Day Three    Grams wouldn't let me sleep! It was 7:30 in the morning, and she was doing everything possilbe to wake me up! We ate breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, and believe me, if no one has ever told you to not eat at hotel restaurants, DON'T! The food was horrible, and totally not worth the $16.02 that we had to pay for it! Oh well. We also went crusin' around town, and we ate at the Golden Corral, which was really yummy, and cheaper than the hotel's breakfast! LOL We then went to some stores and looked around. The housekeeper read my notes and wrote me a letter!!! It really freaked me out! We came back to the hotel and there was this nicely written note on the table, and so I was like, "Grams, did you like write a poem or something?" And she was like, "no" so I started to read the letter, and I felt a little bad because I had written on my notes how much I didn't like the breakfast at the hotel! But the housekeeper's name was Jane, and by the note, she seemed really nice. She said that she was from Europe, and she asked me what my name was and where I was from. So, I wrote her a letter back and left it on the table. That was pretty cool actually.     Day Four    I'll really miss the view around there. There was this guy watching us as we were backing out and so I waved at him! LOL He nodded back, it was funny. I saw a sign that said, "Gator Heads" and I'm not sure waht they mean by that, but I don't like the sound of it! And please don't tell me that people actually eat Gator Jerky!!! I must say that having cable for a few days was awesome. I watched music videos, some movies, and Boy Meets World! LOL I really liked like one movie but I can't remember the name of it. The whole plot was totally predictable, but I do, as Grams says, have that writer's instinct. Hey, just because something is predictable doesn't mean that it's not good! Okay, now I'm really starting to hope that  Ashden  isn't predictable!   I went to bed at like 8 o'clock the day that we got home. I was soooo tired! Yesterday I got my  urlLink pictures  developed, and I worked on getting them on the internet from one until nine, so you guys better be happy about seeing these pictures!!! I was going to link more things on this entry, but I just don't feellike doing all of that right now, LOL, soif this is boring, which hopefully it isn't, then oh well!   Being back in reality is good, but well, it has its bad points as well. Yesterday I got a message onour answering machine from the yearbook teacher about a meeting on Monday. I had thiswholebig problem with my schedule last year because they putpeople who are supposed to be in newspaper inyearbook. So,today I have to call the school and see if they are still having a newspaper class, andif not, then I guess I will be taking yearbook and going to a meeting on Monday from nine until four. Yes, I saidnine until four! That's longer than a normal school day! I really woudln't mind being in yearbook, but it's  A LOT of work! I really want to be on the newspaper staff, but I do have this little feeling that they just simply aren't going to have the class this year. A lot of stuff happened last year with newspaper and yearbook ... but that's a  LONG  story.Anyway, I also have my interview at JCPenny today,and I'm really hoping that I get the job! I really think that today is my final test of the summer. I really wanted to work on being more outgoing (which I am, just not at school) and well, today I have to do two things (calling the school and going to an interview) that I would normally freak out about. I think I'll be fine though. LOL This summer I've had trouble with talking to people and them being mean to me!!! I'm serious, at the DMV and at the eye doctor - I always try to be really sweet, but these people were just flat out mean to me! Oh well, I'll deal.   Well, I'll write later. Check out my vacation pictures okay! JKM - OUT!
