Ahh, I love being relaxed cause usually I'm really jumpy! If you say "Boo" behind me I'll probably jump about two feet into the air. It's cause of my brother... and scary Doctor Who movies! Eeek! I'm gonna go, getting kickem offem again! (I have a thing about em after words...) Never mind, just my strange little world I guess.
