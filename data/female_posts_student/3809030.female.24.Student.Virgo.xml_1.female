This was by far one of the nastiest things I have had to endure in my life. Man the sight was horrifying, and the smell, don't even get me started. I am taking a human anatomy coarse for summer school. To put it plain and simple, it's KICKING my ass, big time! I am taking a five month coarse in seven weeks, so I guess I should have expected it, RIGHT? NO, nothing could have prepared me for this. NOTHING!! I have been studying all day everyday this past month, and knowing this has to go on for another month is killing me. Oh well, enough of my bitching today.... Save some for tomorrow!
