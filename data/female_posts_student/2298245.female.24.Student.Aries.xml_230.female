The professor is very animated, and he's also very funny, plus some of the cases are rather funny...if one is slightly immature, which I've never seen myself as.  But still, today I laughed.  And once I started I couldn't stop.  Guess I was just really tired.  I feel like it's been a long week, even though it hasn't.  I guess I just have a lot going on, and that makes it feel long.    Today, however, is a long day.  At school from 9 AM until 10:35 PM.  I may need a map to make it that long.  That, or copious amounts of caffeine.
