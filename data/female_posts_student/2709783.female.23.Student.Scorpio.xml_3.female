She drives it down the backroads so fast that she discovers an alternate universe/shortcut which allows her to get from point A to point B impossibly quickly.  I've always wanted to be able to do that.  Yesterday, in my zeal to find the shortest route to my new/old job at the USDA in Cleburne, I managed to drive about 2 hours longer than I needed to.  It was the opposite of the aforementioned short story.  En route to Cleburne, I simply misjudged the best way and took a slightly longer one, adding half an hour to my trip.  Okay.  On the way home, determined to make up for my morning, I missed the turn to the shortest way home and drove to Meridian.  That's right, 60 miles out of the way.  By the time I realized what was happening there were no turnoffs, but I kept thinking there would be and that I could get back to sunny Waco before, I don't know, dark.  (insert honking WRONG! noise here)  I did have the pleasure of driving through Morgan, Texas, where burros roam the streets.  Yes, I said burros.  I also spotted two extremely weird/funny things:  the Morgan cemetary appears to have no graves in it.  I'm not sure why you'd have an empty cemetary.  If it's because the residents of Morgan are trying to hide their immortality by creating a sham graveyard, they should add some fake headstones.  If it's because no one wants to be buried there (understandable), they shouldn't have wasted the taxpayers' money on a plot of land and iron gate.  Weird/funny thing #2:  The Lamb's Corral of Christian Fellowship in Laguna Park.  This is funny because the word "Corral" was obviously there before the others, leading me to believe that a religious organization took over a more questionable establishment but didn't take the time to re-do the signage.  It's like reverse satire.   To close, a good news/bad news pair.  Good news is, I'm back at a job I really enjoy for the summer.  This location will be a challenge, both for the commute and because of the backlog and previous lack of organization here, but I'm looking forward to it and I absolutely love the program.  I might note that by "previous lack of organization" I didn't mean simply pre-Randa, but for several years.  My presence is not what put Cleburne on the path of righteousness, but I'd like to think it will help.  Also, I like working for the government because I get to say cute little phrases like "good enough for government work."  On another note, one of my closest friends who is finishing a tour of duty in Korea learned he is probably going to Iraq in August.  I'll try not to turn this into a political rant.  He has a family back home and was looking forward to returning to Texas, as August will be four years and the army promised him no more foreign tours when he was sent to Korea.  He joined the military when he was 21 because of a dearth of employment/educational opportunities in the Abilene area and to "jump out of planes".  Who needs a draft when you have inner city and rural kids who will sign up because they have no other options?    Provide noncombat options to upper class elites while sending working class children to fight an unjust war?  Mission accomplished, Mr. President.
