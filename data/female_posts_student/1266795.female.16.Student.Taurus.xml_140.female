Something happened today. Something extraordinary. It's amazing.   I cleaned my room. I mean CLEANED it. I took 8 garbage bags full of junk and yeah. It's SPOTLESS now. I mean, I have a floor, a bed, two bookshelves, a dresser, and...A DESK! And desk chair! wOOt!!!! It's amazing!!!! I am so happy!  Nathan gave me the most awesomest cd last night. I love it so much. Actually, I switched in between his cd and my new Band of Brothers cd as I cleaned my room today.  Otherwise, not much more here. I'll update later! Sarah comes home soon!  Jane and Ali: I need to talk to you both. Email me. Please. (musiknote2000@yahoo.com) :-D "LOOK! Purple tuna!"
