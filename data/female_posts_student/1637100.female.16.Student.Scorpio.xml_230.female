WRECK BEACH!!!!! hahahahahaha.. it was hilaroius.. and quite... disturbing... right at the entrance, this guy was asking ppl to sign a petition to save the beach coz the city or wahtever is planning on shutting it down to put up highrises.. anyways, what a greeting.. a nude guy.... asking  for us to sign a petition. we stayed there a total of around 10 minutes. it was lovely. after that we went to jericho beach and then went home.  on tuesday i went to school and met up with tif coz she was gonna spend a few days at my house. we went to eddy's house for his lil birthday thingy.. and chilled at his house from 12:30-9:30.... yeup. it was fun fun fun! his house is freakin HUMONGOUS and his pool was awesome. it was pretty fun. we chilled in the pool [i got thrown into the water a few times GRR!] and then we watched Mulan [hahaha: THE HUNS HAVE INVADED  CHINA!!

HEHEHEHEHEHE  that night we watched 007 with my mom and then after that we watched secret window. it was pretty good.. johnny depp... *droolz* anyways, we watched it and it wans't that "scary" or whaever you wanta call it... but yeah. it was good. then we fell asleep watching about a boy. on thursday we woke up late and then we went to malcolm's elementary graduation thigny. pretty cool. wow. malc's in highschool. hehehe. anyweays, after that we went back home where my mom found out that my dad had won this lil contest that he had entered. the prize was one free night in a hotel.. in fact that night. so mom and dad left to go to the hotel thing, jo n zack went to ateh gemma's house and me n tif had the whole house to ourselves. after crankin up the music..... and ordering pizza.. we were ready.. we spent the night on the internet, playing video games alll night [yeah!! crash bash!!] and our other activities included doing laundry [first time ive ever washed laundry volluntarily, and successfully too i might add] washing dishes at 3:30 AM, cooking/eating mr. noodles at 4:00 AM, folding laundry/watching about a boy @ 4:30 AM, and cleaning my room at 5:30 AM. that was pretty cool.. we finally went to bed at like 6:30... and then 3 and a half hours later we were woken up by the phone ringing.  it was eddy. i cant remember why he called.. but it had something to do with the movies... later that day, eddy, his bro, n his sis came over... then me, jo, zack, and them [tif went home] headed off to the movies to watch Shrek 2. yeup. my birthday present to eddy was an $8 movie ticket.
