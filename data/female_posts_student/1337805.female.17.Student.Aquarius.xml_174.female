Thinking.   Checked my email today, always the first thing I do when I get to class. Got an email from Adam. I was half hoping in my heart, that he'd never get it, and we'd continue acting as we do. But he has gotten it.  Said it's taken him a long time to figure it out, and put down the words to say. I've already emailed him back, but once again I wish I had waited a few more minutes, to tell him to forget the email, call me, hug me, kiss me, love me.   Sting - Fragile  Every day I wake up, and the first thing that hits my head is, The Email. Wondering why I sent it. Why? Because it was my thoughts, and they had to be said. And this time it wasn't effective enough to put the words down on paper. I had to send the email. I couldn't even blog it.  As much as I love him, and want to be with him for the rest of my life, these issues have to be sorted through. We are always saying we'll get to them, and sort them out, but then we get sidetracked, a word of someone's beauty, or worth, and instantly off-topic. Like we need a topic dog for our conversation. It's awful.  I've told Laura that we're through, but I still can't admit it to myself. He plagues my dreams, my everything, and I don't know what to do. I'm stuck.  Sarah McLaughlin - Angel  I need him. Bad. Somehow, I need to see him, to talk to him, to express myself in spoken text rather than written. Even a simple phone call could work. While webcamming. You could see my tears, exasperation, love, and hear it too.  You are always so limited when you are confined to writting your words. Like our relationship, friendship, whatever, is confined to a little box in the play room.   I'm so confused. Laura says, "Get someone else to take your mind off of it." And I've tried. But how can you snuggle up to someone and not think of Adam? I'm lost, and useless now.    Rave - Jungle Underground
