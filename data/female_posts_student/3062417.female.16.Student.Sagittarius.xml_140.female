I've earned $200 so far this summer. Not bad but it's still not enough for anything I need or want.      I've been hanging out with friends. I hung out with Carol yesterday and today. I went to a softball game with Joelle on Monday.      Other than that I've just been hanging out here doing a whole lot of nothing. I've even been reading (amazing huh?). Oh, and I went to the mall one day too. I only went to Target though because I had to buy Paige a birthday present.      And before I forget, thank you to Gavin for the cd. I'm still waiting for mine back though. And I'm holding yours captive until I get mine back. lol      So basically, my summer has sucked ass so far.       Listening to: [The Brilliant Dance by Dashboard Confessional]     So this is odd,    the painful realization that has all gone wrong.    And nobody cares at all,    and nobody cares at all.       So you buried all your lover's clothes   and burned the letters lover wrote,    but it doesn't make it any better.    Does it make it any better?    And the plaster dented from your fist   in the hall where you had your first kiss    reminds you that the memories will fade.       So this is strange,    our sidestepping has come to be a brilliant dance    where nobody leads at all,    where nobody leads at all.       And the picture frames are facing down    and the ringing from this empty sound    is deafening and keeping you from sleep.    And breathing is a foreign task    and thinking's just too much to ask    and you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights.      This is incredible.    Starving, insatiable,    yes, this is love for the first time.    Well you'd like to think that you were invincible.    Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time?    Well this is the last time.
