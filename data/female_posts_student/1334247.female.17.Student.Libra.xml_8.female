Not too exciting. We're starting to do stage makeup in drama. So, that'll be fun. We also had to register for classes for next year. It's kind of scary thinking of being a senior. Yes, it will be fun, but it will be a little scary to know that it's your last year of high school. However, we need a minimum of 6 classes a semester. Unfortunately, I am taking 7 1st semester. I really dont want to, but I'm in band, and that makes 7 classes.
