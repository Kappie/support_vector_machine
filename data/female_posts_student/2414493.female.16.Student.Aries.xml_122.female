Slept through just about the entire Ballard study session. 12:15pm. I'm hungry. I wish we could go out to lunch for sandwiches but I discovered a huge pot of congee on the stove, so I know what we're having. I need to find Anna's bday invitation. The phone keeps on ringing for no particular reason and set off Jessy's keychain this morning. I then woke up.  It's another one of those what am I doing with my life? days. I think I'll study. I just realized I have to listen to a CD for piano and pick a piece before Monday. I probably want to practice Chopin before Monday. Arr, I just found a 15% off coupon that I could have used, but it's expired now. My room's still a mess, but only because I have insisted on keeping my birthday stuff out. I want to hang up Jessy's star lamp. I'm very much awake, and yet I feel like I'm not. Still in pajamas. Probably will be until I have to go somewhere.  I really don't know what I'm doing, and I'm ok with that.
