I got invited to go downtown by a couple of people for the fireworks, but I feel so tired that it would be boring. I haven't said much today because of how tired I am.   I stayed at Joe's last night, I had a lot of fun. We went up to his friend James' house and Chad was up there too. He is funny as fuck. I was pretty gone around 1 a.m. I ended up having a pretty good conversation with Joe though. You know those drunken conversations, not quite sure if he remembers anything he said though.  I'm thinking about walking down the street to watch the fire works because I will be the only one there, and I would be at the top of the hill, so it will be easy to see. I'll also be able to smoke a few because Papa Smalleagle doesn't want me smoking at the house. The little fireworks people next door keep setting off are driving me crazy. It sounds like niggers are doing a fucking drive-by out there.  Hm, still contemplating whether I will give this Journal address out or not. I'm thinking maybe only giving it to Joe, but who knows. I figure that if I really needed a private journal that bad, I can start one on paper.  *Yawn*
