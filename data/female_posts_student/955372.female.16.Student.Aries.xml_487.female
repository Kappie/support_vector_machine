I SHOULD work on it now since i'll have nothing to do all study hall.. but HEY why would i wanna do that right... right. ew i'm having such a fuck ass day. like seriously i am just GAH i am soooooo glad today is friday and i don't have to comeback for like another week and a day. yay. oh and yeah why the hell does it have to keep raining. i mean i love rain. a lot. but everytime it rains that mean people (aka person) i hate comes home on my bus and harrasses me incessantly. It was great when said person had "laryngitis" (sp?) but now person is back. GOD and i was hoping weeks of bedrest would cause his muscles to atraphy, so he would be paralyzed for life... never bothering  me again. sigh, but it was only a dream.
