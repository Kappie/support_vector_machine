I will give up.. n give her my blessings.. for we wont be made for each other again... there were flaws.. n e flaws will remain.. dis past relationship can only be a memory.. on e other hand.. how I wish.. I could have a hidden past.. or suffer from memory loss tt will erase this relationship.. if I can.. I do not wanna tink abt her anymore.. if I can.. I wld choose not to love her.. I dun wanna be reminded of her anymore.. I wan to forget her.. forget everything about her.. n start afresh.. I wanna disappear from her life.. I won't be there for her anymore.. I do not wanna see her too.. I'm sorry.. I tink this is e only way for me to move on.. u tk care.. If one day, we are fated to meet on e streets.. wad will I do.. jus pretend that we nv knew each other.. smile n walk away.. stare n walk past each other.. or will we stop n talk..? I do not know.. n I do not hope for such a day..
