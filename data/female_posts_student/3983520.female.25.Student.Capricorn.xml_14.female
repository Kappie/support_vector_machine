I also must say that I have been extremely blessed to have accomplished the things that I have over the years, but that is not for anyone to say that I am complaining or not happy with what I have achieved.     During some of my ups and downs their have been some very supportive people there for me and I appreciated all the helped offered.  However some of my downs were not always due to my own actions but I had to suck it up and deal with it the best way possible.   I think at times those around me forget my age and what they were doing when they were my age.  A lot of the things I experience now are a direct consequence of the choices that I made and I don't complain about those things.  I complain about the things that affected me that I didn't have a choice in.  Like my parents divorcing after 30+ years, or having to deal with a mother whose moods go up and down and she picks and chooses which child she is going to be friendly with.  I just don't want to be on the roller coaster.   I have too much that I am  striving for to worry about some one else's issues, so why worry about mine.   Thanks to all the encouraging comments, I needed them.  At least there are a few of you who can understand and listen without being judgemental.
