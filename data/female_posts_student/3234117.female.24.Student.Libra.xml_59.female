My professor said everyone in graduate school has to be obsessive-compulsive or they wouldn't make it through. 3. I have 40+ apartments written down to call closer to my move date. (OCD, huh?) 4. What's up with the Dallas hair? 5. Affect or effect? 6. Open Water or Little Black Book? 7. Should I tell my mom I bought two skirts on her credit card for a total of 112 dollars now or should I wait til after she gets the bill? They're nice skirts. My first purchases ever from Ann Taylor 8. I won't be getting a stipend at my practicum. The Dr. said, "You probably think you know a lot of things, but you don't." (Where in the hell does the stupid (.) go?) "If you had a masters degree I would consider giving you a stipend. I came through as well straight from undergrad and I didn't get paid practicums." That's nice, but if I were his supervisor, I would've given him a stipend so I should get one too. 9. Is it hot in here? I've got the air on. Am I going through early menopause? Hot flashes! 10. How is it that my electric bill for an 800sq ft apartment is 90 dollars? 11. Do obese people look in the mirror on certain days and think, man I look good today? This would only explain why some "heavy" people choose to wear clothes tighter than I would. 12. My sister is dating another boy in Denton. Who is 21. She is 17. 13. What's up with guys these days? 14. What's up with this post?
