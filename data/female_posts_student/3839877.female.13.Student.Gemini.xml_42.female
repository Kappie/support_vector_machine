Actually it just means you have plenty to talk about, but not always someone around to whom you can speak. Perhaps you're just bursting with emotion, imagination, or the need to communicate. (As a child, you probably talked to an imaginary playmate.)  Under the right circumstances, talking to yourself can be a delightful way to release mental "steam" and to confide in a friend (namely, yourself). As long as you allow room for other friends to join in! Think about it. Talk it over with yourself.
