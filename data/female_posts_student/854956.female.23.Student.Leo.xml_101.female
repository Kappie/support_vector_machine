I think some stuff was entertaining because I kept hearing jokes from Mr. Sinus's Terminator.  ;)  "Okay, the director told me to look right.... and then left...." (in Arnold's voice).  ;)  I do have to agree with Ricky... at many points it was obvious they were trying to see how much stuff they could smash and destroy.  But, it was actually pretty cool.  I didn't like the ending though... it seemed TOO happy an ending.  Anyhow, after that we went back to Ricky's... and we were there for awhile.  Then we went over to Jennifer's for a few minutes... and then we went back to Ricky's.  We watched May... but Druck left partway through it.  He said he wanted to be able to fall asleep early... LIAR... I heard him sign on after I got home from Ricky's!!!  :-)  Anyhow... what's up for today?  I need to go get low carb friendly groceries at Sun Harvest.  :-\  Not looking forward to doing THAT on a Saturday.  Anyhow, I'll post more later if anything happens.
