Last night Jake went to the senior camp out and there is nothing wrong with it and i don't have an issues with Kristelle anymore but i just have the feeling of untrust with Jake. Like last night i feel like he could have been tempted to do sumtin with Kristelle. I want to say that i trust him compleatly but he is a 17 year old guy wanting to experiment. Then it seem like latly we have talked very VERY little. He just wants to see me. And then when he does see me all he wants to do is well... use ur imagation. I'm sure u can figure it out. So it isn't that i mind doing it sometimes but it is a consent. Like everytime we see each other. We can never just chill out and sit around. And everynight my suspsion about Jake likeing Kristelle grows more and more. I just don't know where to ture anymore. So please if anyone has any advice (Katie talkin to you) Plz help me out here. I do love Jake but i just and a lil scared right now. Where do i turn. What do I do??? I AM SO CONFUSSED!!!  Jess to you my deepest sympthy to you and your "significat other" issue. LOL Two of us both crying over guys on the same night this is suckie of the assie. LOL. Ok well that is all for now lata i shall put my pome in here i wrote last night!! Peace out,
