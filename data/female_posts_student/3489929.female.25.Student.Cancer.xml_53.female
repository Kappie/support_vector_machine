Like, really, really hot. With really, really nice arms and that black, black hair and that piercing stare and... damn, why'd he let himself go?  Anyway... I'm sad. First Tony Randall, who I adored, then Reagan, who admittedly wasn't the best actor but a pretty decent Prez, and now Brando.  I'm almost as sad as I was last summer when Katharine Hepburn died. Almost.  I don't care if anyone thinks   I'm   sad for being sad about all these people passing away. I'm a huge, huge classic movie fan, and it's sad to see them go.  They just don't make movies like they used to...  Moving on.  It's been a long two days while Posh was out, and now I have an inkling of how she feels when she has four people shouting questions at her all day, and Jefe making demands, and having to open deals and deal with the assholes that we normally get to pawn off on her. It was EXHAUSTING. I felt like I was being dragged in fifteen different directions for the past two days, and I can't believe I am about to say this, but I am so glad she is coming back on Tuesday. I can't take this anymore.  This prick called in today and gave Blondie a hard time, saying he was going to sue us for "harrassment." She didn't know how to handle it, so she hands it to me, so you know there's a smackdown coming. He proceeds to tell me that he has two of our reps on tape telling him we are paying off his bills, but- surprise, surprise- when I ask to hear it, it's "in his office" and not available for listening. It turns out he works as a bill collector so he knows what we do, yet he is bitching me out saying that we are harrassing him- even after I pointed out that we have NEVER called him, though he has called US three times in the past month, so if you want to talk harrassment... He then proceeds to call me... well, here's a transcript as best as I can remember:  Prick: "Look, you fucking bitch, I want your full name and position. You have to give it to me. It's the law." Me: "Um, I don't have to give you anything if you're being abusive to me." Prick: "I can call you a fucking cum-swallowing whore and you still have to tell me your fucking name and position." Me: "Um, okay." Silence. Prick: "So, what's your name, bitch?" Me: "If that works for you." Prick: "I said, 'what's your name?'" Me: "Brandie." Prick: "And your last name?" Me: "You don't need that. I'm the only Brandie that works here." Prick: "You have to give me your last name." Me: "Okay, um... Smith." Prick: "And what is your position there?" Me: "Representative." Prick: "Of what?" Me: "Of... the company you just called." Prick: "I asked for your position, you fucking bitch." Me: "This is not the military, sir. I am not required to state my name, rank, and serial number." Prick: "Is Brandie Smith your real name or your alias?" Me: "My what?" Prick: "Your alias. A fake name." Me: "I don't know what you mean by that. This is also not the CIA, sir."  And so on, and so forth, and bladdy-bladdy-blah.  So then he tells me I work for a company of liars, and then I told him I had been working there for five years and I know I have never heard someone lie to a customer but I have known many customers that don't understand plain English. Then he tells me the only reason I still work there is because I can't find a better job, which was funny (and sometimes SEEMS true, but in all honesty, I could find one if I actually got up off my ass and looked). I pointed out to him that he's one to talk since he works as a BILL COLLECTOR, which is one step up from cockroach in most people's opinions.  Then he asked me how I sleep at night, since I spend my life lying to customers, so I answered, "Tylenol PM."  Then he asked me how I could look myself in the mirror, and I told him I could see myself just fine, and furthermore I could feel good knowing that what I do for a living helps people live a better life, when all he does for a living is make people want to kill themselves because he badgers them to death when they can't pay their bills. Nyah nyah, a boo boo. :)-  Finally, he said I was stupid and had a low IQ, and that I was a "dumb shit." Which is all essentially the same thing. Duh. So I popped off with, "You know, sir, you're not hurting my feelings, no matter how hard you try. You know what? You seem really, really unhappy- do you know Jesus Christ?" He flipped out, saying, "You just broke the law! You can't talk about religion on the phone!" So I just sat there, and he said really snidely, "That shut you up, didn't it?" And I said, "No, sir, but if you're not saved, there's no need for me to waste my time talking about it. But I will pray for you." And that shut HIM up, for like 2 seconds (and as a sidebar, I do feel kinda bad for breaking out the religion talk, when I'm kinda not really all that into it myself, but I knew it would piss him off...).  So then he kept telling me to hang up on him, because he wanted to be able to report to my supervisor that I hung up on him, and I told him I would not give him the satisfaction, and after 28 minutes and 52 seconds he finally gave up and hung up on me.   Victory dance! *waves arms, shakes big ass*  I mean, I was able to respond with a perfectly sweet voice in a perfectly calm manner and throw back every bit of vitriolic diatribe he was throwing off at me with a smile and a cheery tone. And boy, did it piss him off.  And the sad thing is, he was at work when he was saying all this shit to me. I wish I knew what company he worked for- I'm sure they'd be mad as hell if they knew he was talking like that on company time.  He even asked me at one point, "So how many of your coworkers are standing behind you listening to your performance?" And I told him the truth: "None. See, we actually  work  at my company." Teehee.  I told Jefe about the conversation, and he laughed and said it was "great." He loves it when people act like dumbasses.  But I kinda wish I hadn't had to deal with it at all, even though I was able to hold my own and defend my company and not cuss him out, which is what I was dying to do. I would have rather let Posh handle it... after all, she's used to being called a "cum dumpster" and shit like that (another baaaaad call from a while back).  At least she'll be back on Monday. I'm tired of these crazy folks.  Moving forward... again...   I went to my crackhouse, a.k.a. the Hallmark store, today after work and bought myself a pretty new purse that has to be seen to be believed. It's a little over-the-top, but then, so am I!  Lisa's in Mobile this weekend, hopefully shaking off her funk and getting her grove on, and will come back bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, albeit sad that she had to leave (boohoo- at least you've found someone). I will be relaxing on the couch and contemplating the wisdom of Atkins this weekend.  Happy Fourth of July, everyone!
