Right after my tests we're going to go to our province in Bicol, namely Iriga City. We're going to stay there for roughly 10 days, then we head back to the city. Then we leave for Virginia on April 14 or 16, I'm not really sure. We're going to stay there for about a month I think. O_o We head back in May, but we're still going to have a stop over in Hawaii, where we'll stay for about a week. Then it's back to the Philippines. Phew, this summer will be pretty busy. I'm a bit scared tho. With all the terrorist attacks happening, I can't help but think... Nevermind. I'm sure you get my drift.   I've also been thinking about my future. I'm seriously considering going into the ROTC Scholarship for college. I join, then they pay for my college, and they also give me an allowance. But I have to train in ROTC. Plus, the course has to be something useful to the Military, like communications, or international/asian studies, medicine or whatnot. =/ But after college, I'll automatically have a job in either the Navy, Air Force, or Marines for 4-6 years. I'll probably be stationed somewhere, especially if it's the NROTC(Navy ROTC), maybe Europe, or Asia. I dunno. After that time, I can choose either to stay, or quit. *sigh* Seems like so much to absorb.  It weirds me out. I can't imagine myself all grown up.  Maybe my sudden serious thinking is because I fell down the stairs this morning. I was sprawled on the landing, and I laid there for maybe 3 minutes. Our house is dangerous! x_x Our stairs are wood, and my mom waxes and cleans it to no end! That's why so many people fall down the stairs in our house. >_>
