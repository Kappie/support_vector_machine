"i am happy.. just not satisfied".. this may be the most contradictory sentence in the world.. so hard to comprehend.. but to me.. it  makes so much sense.. but how can i feel satisfaction when all im left with is confusion..?? was love made to create pain..?? im just so overwhelmed by all the concepts of love.. im being consumed by them as they pass by.. i dont know who im falling for.. i dont know what to do.. could i go back to my first love (after god).. or the newly presented love of my life..?? or neither..?? im too scared to lose them.. im scared that im going to lose my friends as well.. im in the phase of my life where it seems as if im falling apart from those who i love the most.. now is the time where i feel i need them the most.. but now is the time where i feel as if they dont need me.. im loosing that confidence in which i know that my friends will always be there.. im that person sitting outside of the circle.. that person who doesnt get invited to the parties.. that singular person that left out.. but all i can do now.. is pray for those who i love the most.. and trust in god.. depending on his great love.. to restore back unto me.. the joy of my salvation.. and the joy of life..  _______ ______ _____ ____ ___ __ _  lord.. i come to you now in prayer.. i pray for those who i love.. my friends.. my family.. the people around me.. i pray that you may restore back to me the joy of my salvation.. the joy of being alive.. and the joy of knowing that my friends will always be there.. i pray that you may guide them and protect them.. although they may not trust or want me.. i pray that you let them know that i love.. trust.. and care for them.. lord.. give all of my friends a heart of worship and forgiveness.. lord.. i pray that you make me complete and fill me with your awsome love.. lord.. i love you.. and i thank you for all that you have given on to me.. i pray this through jesus' name.. amen..
