We play them again next Sunday and then we move on to the 2nd stage of qualifying rounds.  European qualifying rounds don't start until August 18th and i dunno if they're even going to be on our tv and i can't watch them if the  World Cup of Hockey is on at the same time! aaah so many games to watch and such short time!!  all my 86:12 kids are back from their retreat.....you kids rest up, i don't need you all getting sick!!  we still have the rest of the summer before camp to party!!!  Haley - have fun in Gulf Shores!!!!   Tell me how the waves are since i won't be there this year....first time we won't be chillin together at camp *tear*!!!  Sarah wants me to go to her choir show tonight.....but i dunno if i can make it! i'll try though!  and the babysitting wasn't that bad, but i have decided that i don't want kids for a looong time lol.  i made $40!!  alright i'm out!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
