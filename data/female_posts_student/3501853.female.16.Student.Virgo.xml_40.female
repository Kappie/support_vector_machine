Ana called, I called Kev, Jon called for like 2 sec (lol) but it was funny wut he said so it was ok I guess. I called Kev again and I feel bad cuz my blonde self forgot I called on his cell so I was rambling on for like 30 min. so I wasted his minutes. Anyways, I got ready and he picked me up. He didn't know wether to beep, call, or go up 2 the door (lol) he went to the door which was really nice. He's got a van, its cute. We went to Dairy Queen. The french vanilla Moolatte tasted nothing like I wanted, bummer (lol) but it was kool nonetheless cuz me and Kev just talked for like 2 hours outside. I was being goofy for the most part but the last leg of the convo was good, talking about music and his future but I had to cut it short so I could get ready for work. Work was okay, a little slow but at least it gave me time to finish Gossip Girl *good book* even tho the ending was a little bittersweet. Argh, that means I have to actually read Huck Finn and seriously that book sucks I have like 400 more pages and it's been such painful reading. During work, my mom dropped off the car cuz the dumb dealer hasn't called yet w/her car but w.e...I thought it was so           *My smile is an open wound without you* --fall out boy
