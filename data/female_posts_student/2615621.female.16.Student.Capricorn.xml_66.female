He was with some little boy named Brad and they went to Katilin Johnsons (keyans house) house to "play basketball", yea them at 7 little girls. SOOO...yeah Brads mom came by my house to drop off something he forgot she stuck around until 1am and they called the cops, 5 cops, an ambulance, the rescue squad and dogs were outside my house along with my grandparents and neighbor....haha and i missed it all. Meanwhile i was at a rodeo with kaela watching her brother "dogshoot" lol (wrestling a steer).   Its a really pretty day!! lol yay im gonna go lay out in the nice warm sun. haha   My dad comes out this weekend! lol im all excited about that one.   Wonder what everyone else is doing today...GOD KNOWS what laurens doing...hahaha jk. *maybe some hot NCSSM guy* wink wink  Katie now tells me she has a "internet bf" who is hot..he added me and is a FREAK. even though i havent seen him and she says hes hot..his name?
