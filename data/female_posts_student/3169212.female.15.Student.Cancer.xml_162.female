Seriously, if traveling to other countries on Earth causes massive jet lag, think about what traveling to other planets will do to ya'. I've lost years to jet lag... Probably. Well, I'll try to calculate it... Master Chief destroyed the Covenant Armada in 2552. It's probably somewhere around 2553-2555. But once again, massive jet lag.  Hey, Elizabeth, what's with that Jack guy? That's one weird drunk. And who's this Will person? Who's Orlando Bloom?  Hey Baka, you speak Spanish? Hablo Español. No  sé  Español, pero lo hablo.
