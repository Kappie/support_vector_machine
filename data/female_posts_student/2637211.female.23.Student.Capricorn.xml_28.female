It really is a film worth seeing, especially for those of us who are sick and tired of being berated and harrassed by the right. The movie is really well done as well. Though at points heavy handed, I cried, got angry and laughed. I think watching the film in Oakland with a large group of fellow liberals worked to make me feel very validated about my beliefs. Also, I felt like all of the reviews I read were way too careful. This is the kind of movie that will get you really pissed off at the scam the Bush administration has pulled. Human lives are at stake, and yet people still want Bush to continue. Are they ignorant of the atrocities and lies of Bush and his cronies? I can't believe people can be so blind.
