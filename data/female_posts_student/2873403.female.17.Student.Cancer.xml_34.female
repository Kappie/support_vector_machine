Varsity was 13-4 or something, I don't really know because I was sleeping on the ground through that whole game. JV was 6-4. I scored 2 of those 4. w00t. After that we had lunch with their team because last year we threw a lunch party thing for them, so they repaid the favor and we ate a lot. We met this girl who lives in Highland Lakes during the summer and is going to our junior prom so we're going to see her there. She was nice. I don't remember her name though. Oh well.  Last night Nick came over then we went out for pizza and we made him drink stuff because he has a fear of liquids then we went back to my house and watched Matilda and Dude, Where's My Car? It was good times. Very good times.  Oh yeah and I got my prom dress motha fuckas. Now I'm one of the loser cool kids.
