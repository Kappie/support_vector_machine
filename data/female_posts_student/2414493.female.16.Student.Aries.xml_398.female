That's one of my pet peeves, taking forever in the shower. I've been critiqued twice for taking "short" showers. Yeah, so I don't take up your bathroom time. It's not that I'm not clean, or that they're particularly so. I just don't understand what takes so long.  There was a girl in here past 1am last night talking about some guy Derek at the top of her voice and laughing. I shut the door to the room in protest. And Sarah talks on the phone all the time. I don't want to seem like I'm listening in, but the first thing she does in the morning is take the phone off the charger.  Maybe it's nice that I'll be going home.  I didn't realize the research paper and the lit essay were due so soon. It's August 2 today, I have to finish both by 1:30pm August 12. Ten days. I think I should get started on anthro, perhaps. I'm going to the archives today. Maybe I'll bring the computer and just type out the whole entire article on it. I wonder if that's allowed, or if I even need all that information.  Today's going to be all right. I have to finish Nabokov and check up on what I'm supposed to read for anthro, plus maybe think of questions for discussion. Andrew's going to be here in less than a week. I just realized that. I wonder what he's bringing with him.  Matt grows more and more repulsive by the day. Too bad Ellis's 22-year-old sister  isn't  BoA. "Is she attractive? easy?" Sprinkle in phrases of bad Spanish and misspelled English. Ignorance is disgusting. When's the last time I was so thoroughly repulsed by someone? I can't quite remember.  It's another case of the Mondays.
