Also, Gordie Howe, while on a recent trip to Florida, discovered the fountain of youth and will come back to play with the Avalanche. The New Jersey Devils have decided Brodeur isn't the "goalie of the future" for them, and in a bold move have traded him to the Avalanche for a 4th round pick. The Stars, deciding to go with the recent "rebuilding" trend in the NHL, have decided to dump some salary by trading Turco to the Avs for Martin Skoula and a broken skate that was found by the cleaning staff behind Roy's old locker. In a suprise move, Scotty Bowman has decided to come out of retirement to coach the Avalanche. Tony Granato will be demoted to second assistant towel boy. In light of these recent moves, the rest of the NHL has decided to forfeit the rest of the season and award the Stanley Cup to the Avalanche permanently. The NHL awards ceremony will be held next week, where every award will be given to Peter Forsberg. The Hockey Hall of Fame will be renamed to The Pierre Lacroix Hall of Fame and will be devoted entirely to the Avalanche. That's just what I hear..." -a guy on the Avs forum making fun of a stupid trade rumor   "One ought, each day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture and, if possible, speak a few reasonable words."-Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  "Writing about music is like dancing about architecture."-Frank Zappa  "Nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished without passion."-Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel    All my weirdness:  (in seminar) Ashley: I'm so excited! There's only thirty days until the extended version of The Two Towers comes out! Sarah: Why don't you just say it comes out in a month? Ashley: Because it's actually a little longer than that, it's more like thirty-four days but I forgot to look at my calendar this morning. Sarah: Okay, so it's roughly a month. Brandy: Geez, even  I  could find better things to fight about.  (this one was actually on the fall retreat also, I just forgot about it.) Joy: I went for a run this morning, and I saw these deer, and then I got to a place where you can look down over this like pasture and there were these that were like RACING across it -  Mark: It was just like Seabiscuit.  (in newspaper) Katie: My friend LOVED your story. Jeff: Your friend? Katie: The guy that I'm dating. Jeff: Oh really - what does THAT mean? Katie: You know... we go out sometimes.  (in seminar) Ashley: You're scary. Sarah:  You're  scary. Ashley I  know  I'm scary.  Katie: I'm taking points off of anyone who disses on the Yankees today. Mike: I wish  I  lost 6-4 last night...  "I think the whole thing was an LSD experience." -Sarah about the Pooh Bear stories (after Erin pointed out that on this one Pooh binder I have said things like "how sweet to be a cloud" on it.)  Rachelleisms: "Doesn't white-out poison your skin?"  (during science) "If you have a cold, will your cells look different?"  (during a lab) "Ms. Nolte! My cheek cell isn't working!"
