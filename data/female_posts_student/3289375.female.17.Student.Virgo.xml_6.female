Those are questions that im dying to look for.. i want to know what my life is gonna be about. I dont like to predict the future but whatever future i get i will try to make good decisons and think as a mature and bigger person.   Time is something that i really dont have patient for, i am unpatient i want to see what god has planned out for me. I want to know how imma live my life, but i have to be patient theoretically. I feel a great confusion inside o fme because sometimes i just want to rush into my life but at the same time i am afraid of what my future is gonna be but what i know so far is that i want to be either a teacher or an assitant nurse. I want to go graduate and go to college to make my parents proud of me then finish college and then start my career.   My aspiration is to be able to work with kids because i love working with kids. I love the way they show they love you and i love playing with them which is why i want to be an elementary teacher or maybe a pediatrician. I believe kids are the only innocent ones in this world and cant be blame  for the things and the war that go around the world. I just wnat to be able to reach my goals and achieve what i want which is go to college and get a good career for me and my future family.
