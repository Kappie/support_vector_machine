I just left feeling really *open*, like I am in charge of my own destiny, like I have control of my fate, and  I can choose the life I want to live , can choose who I want to live it with, and  I am capable enough to make my choices work . I guess there were some unconscious aha's-- some inaudible shifting.   Whenever this happens I am reminded of the tectonic plates (are there a few kinds of plates?) that are  moving and shifting deep beneath the earths surface . We can't notice in any one moment that they are affecting the earth's surface- except for an occasional dramatic slip- but over long stretches of time, watching as if it is time lapse photography, there are definate changes. I feel like after the appointment, I was looking at myself 500 years ago and seeing 'wow, such huge changes and I never noticed until I stopped and compared'-- I don't know, this isn't quite the perfect analogy, or my words aren't matching the idea, but it was sort of like that.  Something else struck me as I was leaving the office: there is a train station right across the street from the counseling center. I have always been aware of it, and being an avid traveler always enjoy seeing it when I go there, and kind of bookmarked it in my head. This week, it finally began to click, and I tried to write a poem about it, then tried to write a song about it, and neither one seemed to work. It is a complicated thing-- there is something about  the combination of opening old wounds, and then immediately being given an exit route  that I find really exciting. When I leave the therapist, I feel exposed, open, vulnerable-- and to immediately see the train station-- I fantasize about running away,  as if I could somehow possibly run away from the conditioning that has created my suffering . It is pure fantasy- I know that old maxim "wherever you go, there you are" all too well.   But therapy also has been bringing up a lot of my dissatisfaction with my current life- my boredom, ennui, etc- and  exiting via the nearest train sometimes seems like the best solution . It reminds me of this idea I have long had for a story about a girl who disappears from the movie theatre while at a matinee with her lover. "I could just leave" she thinks to herself, walking out of the dark theatre on her way to get popcorn. " I don't want popcorn. I don't want to see this movie. I don't, in fact, want this life at all. " She sees the double doors, and decides to trust fate, knowing she has distant old friends and a reasonable bank account. I guess the character of the 'One Who Has Had Enough' is not an uncommon portrait... but it is intriguing to me nonetheless. I can relate to it. Even though ultimately I know that it is more beneficial to stay in relationships- that  intimacy is the only way to ever really be 'known' in this life - I can't help indulging an adolescent fantasy or two from time to time.   I sit in my car, crumpled tissue in hand, watching for approaching trains, thinking of all the places I could decide to go, and  all the places I might happen upon in my travels . I wonder if suicidal patients ever sit and consider jumping in front of one.  I wonder what other patients think to themselves when they see the Amtrak sign and hear the familiar crank-thud crank-thud .   I remember once when I was in New Mexico, my partner and I were standing by the railroad tracks and this train went by and it was going so incredibly slow. He was a few feet behind me, looking down scanning for interesting rocks. I could reach out and touch this moving train, and it was these empty flatbeds, and knew I could have just hopped on and laid staring up at the desert sun and gone for a nice long ride- and a part of me, what I call my fantasy self, did just that. My physical self, the one writing now, remained by the side of the train, noticing the crunch of dry dirt beneath my feet, keeping in pace with our lazy conversations. But part of me went away, and I don't think it ever came back. I wonder where I might find that part of me someday. Is this what they do 'soul retrievals' for? I have heard in shamanic cultures of this phenomenon where parts of the spirit split off and are left behind, or go in different directions than the rest of the spirit. I guess this is supposed to be an affliction, but I don't know.  I like the idea that at least one small part of me is laying on that flatbed, and riding that Amtrak off into the sunset .   Music : Cure, Wish. Especially 'Letter to Elise.'  Mood : Hopeful, Longing.  Miscellany : I did the math and realized I was probably conceived on New Years Eve, since my bday is exactly 9 months after that (9/28). My developmental psych teacher said that week is usually a busy week for births at the hospital.
