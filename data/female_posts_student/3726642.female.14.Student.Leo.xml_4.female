Maple Felithelle was dropped off after a three hour drive car ride where she had been forced to listened her Dad's music and although a few of the songs weren't that horrific (not that she would ever admit that) Maple greeted the sanctuary of school with much more enthusiasm then normal. After the customary good-byes Maple's sorrel eyes scanned the jam-packed entry hall for her two best friends. Almost instantly she spotted Ophelia Uta partly because ophelia was a good bit taller then most of the gir|s and a fair few of the guys and partly because she was the only one in the school with long, shiny, caliginous purple hair.  Slinking though the crowd Maple hopped infornts of Ophelia and yelped,"Vous avez effray√É hors de moi!" "Have fun with Madam Stepmother?" Maple knowingly inquired with a hidden grin. "Picked up some French but that's about it," and disgusted look overcame her usuallytranquill face as she said this, "After two weeks of her cooking the rubbish they feed us here sounds scrumptious." Maple shot her an understanding look but knew to change thesubjectt, " So, anything worth hearing happen in however long you've been here."  Okay-I have to go meet someone so I'll type the next 9 pages later.
