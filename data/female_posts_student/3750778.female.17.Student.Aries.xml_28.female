It starts around 8 in the morning, Dad and 1 or 2 of his brothers(there are 8) start up the 4 or 5 grills that they bring together and cook enough food to feed a medium sized army(that's about what my family is). My aunts bring  a bunch  of food(good stuff)too, and everybody starts arriving around 11. Our driveway becomes a giant traffic jam 3 or 4 cars wide, and even overflows to the neighbors yard. But the he highlight of the party is my uncle Joey and his vehicle. Parked beside the barn in the very back corner of our yard so my momma wont get mad, Joey brakes out the beer and entertains my uncles(horse shoes just isn't the same without someone drunk playing). Noone every gets too extremely drunk, but joey usually has to leave his car here and catch a ride home with someone(the car usually stays in my yard for a month or so because he forgets where he left it). I have such a big family and such a small house that by the time they leave I am just ready to kill them!! Oh the joys of family time....  Branded By Fire in 8 days!!!
