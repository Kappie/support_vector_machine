(Try to guess but I don’t think you’ll get it)   #4    Catwoman  in  Batman Returns  So sexy, so devilish, this, in my opinion is the best portrayal of a comic book character on the big screen.  The team of Batman villains, led by Jack Nicholson, were all over the top.  Both Gene Hackman ( Superman ) and Willem Dafoe ( Spiderman ) served their films well, but Pfeifer was unforgettable.  Bursting with equal parts female rage and sexuality the character is so frightening because she’s as unpredictable as she is seductive.   #3   Darth Vader  That Darth Vader has become the iconic image for evil is all the more impressive when you remember the  Star Wars  trilogy is rated PG.  The long black cape, impenetrable helmet and heavy breathing are enough to send a shiver down anyone’s spine but then there’s that voice.  Oh that voice.  Vocal performances get very little credit but without James Earl Joneses perfect authorative delivery  Star Wars  wouldn’t be what it is today.  The character, in wanting to kill his own son, strikes the same Oedipal ruthlessness as other villains, but none made being bad this cool.   #2    Dr. Hannibal Lector  in  Silence of the Lambs  AFI named a 60 year-old character with slicked back hair who spends 99% of his screen time behind plexiglass the greatest villain of all time.  What makes Lector so terrifying ( I think he is the scariest villain of all time) is he embodies what we most want to be-brilliant, refined, cultured- yet without a conscious.  His almost God-like in his intellect, so brilliant that he burrows into our minds and we are unable to get away.  Lector’s power comes from knowing we will never outsmart him.  A hybrid of wild animal and genius Lectors mind covers the breadth and depth of every imaginable evil.
