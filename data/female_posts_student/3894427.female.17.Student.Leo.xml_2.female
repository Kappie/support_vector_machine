Well, I don't know if your church does this, but on The Lord's Supper you of course have your little tiny cracker/chicklet sized peices of ..something...and then after you partake in that yumminess you drink your gloriously small..as in tiny like babies having babies tiny cup of the blood of the Lord..well in other more simpler words...It's Welches Grape Juice.  So here is my statement for tonights blog, My Savior is great, He is perfect..and so you would figure that the little crackers that represent him would taste better. They should taste amazing, not that nasty cottonmouth "just got back from a Wailers concert" feeling. They could even mass produce them and use that money for missions and such, like "Christ Crisps" or something. Good flavors like cheese, tabasco, maybe even cheesy tabasco! Then again, what would be sacred about the Lord's Supper.  Much like the rest of the world today, nothing is tranquil anymore, everything is a mass produced/over publicised/stressed out mess. Simple is no longer simple.
