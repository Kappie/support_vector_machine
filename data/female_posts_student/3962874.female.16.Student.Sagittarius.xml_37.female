Anyway, a bunch of the island guys set up this jump thing on the dock at the lake and they jump off of their ramp into the lake. Woohoo. Anyway, today Sarah, Kayla and Julie came over to my house and hung out. We went tubing and had tons of fun, swam for a very long time and started to watch The Prince and Me. It was good except we had to stop it to take them to the ferry. Kyla is going to come over and hang out for a while and we are probably going to watch the guys jump some more. Here is Sam going off the jump.  urlLink
