Last night I had this big argument with Mat on msn that went to 1:00 in the morning, and thank goodness it wasn't in person cause I am sure someone would have been hurt.  I can't talk to him, or look at him, or anything.  I just can't.  After we finally finished our conversation/arguement - which was 28 pages, I just sat alone in my basement and cried as tears poured down my eyes.  I just wanted a HAPPY week off, no tears, no being upset, just a happy week, but NOOOO he had no ruin me just wanting to be happy.  Is it such a crime to want to be happy???  There's no chem, no math, but now there are different problems to deal with.  If it's not one thing, it's always another.  I went to BP for lunch today with Ash and Jesse cause I had to get out because I was feeling really depressed.  After crying during the night I thought everything would be ok in the morning, but that wasn't exactly the case.  I feel alot better now that I listened to my Britney Spears Cd lol, and I went to lunch, and Ash and Jesse came over and we played x-box and air hockey.  I am going to try forgot all the shit mat said about me, cause you know what I am better than all that sh*t that mat called me and said I was.  I am better than people who are so low, they have to insult people, make them feel bad, and put em' down.  I am getting my hair done tommorow!!!  I can't wait!  Change, good change for once.  I haven't had my hair done since August, so YAY!!!  And when I get back to school, I will NOT talk to mat, I can't talk to an asshole like that.  I don't think I can even look at him, I don't want to try and find out.  He thinks he is so much better, well I will show him.  I am going to show all those people who constantly point out flaws and faults and everything that seems to be wrong with me to them.  I am going to show them that I don't need to change anything about me.  Cause I am who I am, that is the way it is.  I am me, that is all I can be.
