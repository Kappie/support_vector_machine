What will happen you may ask: He will either shop alone and buy me crap I won't want to ever wear, or he will take me with him and he'll go to the stores that sell crap I won't wear. Does anyone else see a problem with this? Why can't he just give me the money and let me go shopping alone at so let's say Torrid, ( urlLink www.torrid.com ), so I'll have stuff I'll actually wear.
