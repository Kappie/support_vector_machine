Screaming my freaking lungs out saying 'I love you sean/ryan!' Sean stage dived(violinist) and did a bunch of flips offa the speakers lol. Everyone went crazy over them. My arm is REALLLY sore. Oh ya and Ben(guitarist) came off the stage and handed out picks and i got one...it says YC on it! Oh ya and Francesca...I moshed! lol and i did very well lol. Keith and Ryan fell on their asses!...I almost did at one point buts someone picked me up. I almost snapped my rist cuz of the crowd surfers. In the front is where the security guards take them and they kept coming on top of the ppl in front. That sucked but....just seeing yellowcard made me so frikkin happy! They let the audience back up sing in Ocean Avenue. They even played Empty Apartment :)   but now...im sore...this is morning...going off to school on a rainy day.   Emily-BLONDE????? omg you look fine being brunette! Brunettes ROCK!!
