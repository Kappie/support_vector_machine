My qoute for today is worth 300 points, but only if you can tell me a.)what it means and b.) Which type of people said it to whom and WHY....  "Nos morituri te salutant!"   Okie dokie?  Scores stand at: Oliva- 160 Alison-480 Michael- 170 Evan- 160  Yeah. I am not doing too much better, but paradoxically (if that's not a word, it is now) I am. I'll be fine in a couple of weeks. It's just hit me really hard. Thank you all for all of your love and support. I could never  ask for any better friends.   "Shelby! Don't make me come after you in my scooby doos!"
