My family can't get the time off for when I'm supposed to move, so now I can only pack what my car can hold and send for the rest later.  As I said, it should be fun.      So, I have errands to do up until the time I leave.  I never really unpacked when I came home for the summer, so I don't have that much packing to do.  But I have to go get some stuff and get some things done before I return to school.  Not that I mind, it lets me get out of the house.  I'm one of these that if I'm bored, I like to go out for a drive or something.  Plus I probably won't be back this way for awhile.      I have to get back into the mindset where papers, exams, projects, and meetings are an everyday occurence.  After such a long summer, that's easier said than done.  I don't have to worry about a heavy classload, but then again a lot of classes has never really bothered me.  It's all the meetings that I subject myself to because I choose to be in all of them and then halfway through the semester I'm sick of them.  This semester I'm going to try something a little different - besides it's my last time in Macomb, I want to enjoy it and not be living in the Union.  There are some things I almost regret getting into.  But, as always when it comes to activities and such, I'll try to make the best of it.      -------    The supreme happiness of life is the conviction of being loved for yourself, or more correctly, being loved in spite of yourself. - Victor Hugo      Who you are today is a product of what you did yesterday.
