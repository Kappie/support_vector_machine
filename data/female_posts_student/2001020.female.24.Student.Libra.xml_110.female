I mean sure, I was born when Carter was President, but who remembers that? And anyways, he was a great humanitarian, but not a very good politician. No bother, he's doing good with his life now...but Bill, now that's another story. I adore Big Bill. I am going to put the transcript of his DNC speech here so I can read it over and over again (in case it ever goes away). Yay for Democrats!
