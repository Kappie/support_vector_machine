I should get rid of the cutting edges and the aching of not being able to tell anyone about my pains, sorrows and my joy. I should tell the storyn of my life, but I'll just start from this day and start anew. today felt like shit when I woke up. Too urly and my mom was being way too perky, just like she usually is. Always in the mornings, she's one of them morning persons, I'm like an owl, or a cat. I like cats, me and cats are good friends, they like me, I like them. I like to get to ground level and see how they see things. It comforts me in a strange little way. Anyway. My mom and I don't get along. We fight, mental and sometimes physical. Some of my friends know, it's not like she abuses me, but who like it if there are being salad bowls thrown at your head.  I'm all fucked up inside, I should see a psychiatrist, but I allready did that with my family and it didn't help and now my mom won't let me go see one anymore. I need to tell you all I have inside me.  If I find myself a listener, things will get better. after all it's better to be mad at my computer.
