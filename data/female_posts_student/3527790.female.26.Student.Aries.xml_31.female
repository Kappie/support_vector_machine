Hopefully this means I'll get lots accomplished today but.... So far all I've manged to do is email, chat and blog.  I have to attack my mountain of data today. Hopefully get before and one month data points for one kinematic test done today. I'd also like to get the coreection factor firgured out for my can data. But we'll see.  I'm just gald to actually have not just one data point but two!!! VERY exciting!
