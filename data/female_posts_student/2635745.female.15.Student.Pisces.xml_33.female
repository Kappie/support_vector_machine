I told Lindsay how we thought it would be cool if Michael played Juliet for Shakespeare with Medlin.  I think she wanted to be Juliet.  Oh I have good news for those who care.  My foot is healing, it's itchy and I think scabbing.  Oh man I am so tired!  We have shortened classes tomorrow for a suckey assembly on bullying called Bang Bang You're Dead.  Sounds Oscar worthy. Well that's about it for today.  sea you guys tomorrow
