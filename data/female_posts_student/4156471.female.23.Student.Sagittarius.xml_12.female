One the lawn next to the pool there were disco lights and salsa music blaring. Salsa shmalsa. I want ISareli danincg. So I went on the the gym and watched for an hour and a half as the couples twirled around. I had to refuse a couple offers saying in my terrible hebrew that I didnt' know the dnaces. Finally it turned into singles!!!! SO I followed people's steps until I was sweaty and tired. IT was awesome! Wow. It's 11.21 this is good. let;s see if I can hold out until 12 before sleep. Tommorow is capoeria.. I hope capoeria will be a bit better then the dancing tonight. It kind of sucks when ou don't know a single dance... more exhasuting to follow people around then when you actually know the steps. Orientation tommorow!
