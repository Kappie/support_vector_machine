I like peace project...I really do, it's something that I can do apart from school and it's theraputic(sp?) in a way. I just have to learn to make friends with some of these people...and it's not that I don't like them, there's actually a couple of them I extremely admire and would LOVE to actually be friends with(there's quite a difference between 'friends' and 'peace project aquaintances'...is that how you spell it? I can't spell anything today..i don't know what it is..) but like always I'm to shy and I've drawn myself away from people for too long...I seem to ramble about this a lot, i'm just so angry with myself...   I have the most odd mood changes.
