I went to Angels Diner with my aunt and cousins today it was major fun, I then went to Starbucks and got a white Moccah Frapacinno. Scrummy. I heard, thanks to my buddy Eva that David Bowie had to have emergency heart surgery! I was sad, but he is ok,so I am happy. I am wearing my Bowie shirt in his honor today. Eva got red checkered shoes in Toronto, and she seems to like them, so that is a good thing, I am glad of that. I am going shopping with my mommy tonight to get stuff that I need for the cottage. I love mommy! We got me some new undies yesterday, they are pretty. Craig Nichols and his band broke up, that saddens me, I think I will put on some Blur to cheer me up. Country House I think. Last night I was up until like 3 o'clock watching movies. In the past four nights I watched the following movies."Guys and Dolls," "The Country Girl," "Breakfast at Tiffany's," and "Gentelemen Prefer Blondes." They are so good, old school good. I had Old school good though. I had really  nice talks with Taryn, Eva, and Danielle yesterday, it was so fun!! I am going to start work on my novel.Hoccha Author:Eve
