Things went well for most of the day anyway, at least until my parents got home. They did the fighting thing, yelling and whatnot. I mean come on it was Valentine's Day, you'd think they could at least pretend to care for one day. But they can't. So I didn't eat dinner, not wanting to listen to all of that. I stayed upstairs on the computer and sustained myself with mini chocolate bars all evening. Last night I also decided I should move into Steve's room. We'll be sharing a room on a temporary basis to see how long it takes before we kill each other, then my room will just be my escape room and the band room. So last night we dragged my mattress into Steve's room, and we stayed up and watched MadTV. Then after MadTV, this random black comedy show or something comes on, so we started watching that too. HOLY CRAP it was the stupidest, most pointless thing I have ever seen in my entire frickin life! Worse than this blog, so obviously it was pretty bad. I mean, these people weren't even funny! They made jokes about gas stations and mountains and J.Lo's ass... It was bad. And this coming from one of the most easily entertained kids ever born. I fell asleep after the second act. After that I slept like a rock, except for when I started feeling things crawling on my face. I woke up like 8 times, thinking there were bugs crawling on me or something, then I realized, it was my hair. As for today, I'll probably be stuck in the house all day again, cleaning or something, so I might as well get an early start on that, so I can have absolutely nothing to do later on. Adios... (yeah that's about as far as my Spanish comprehension goes)  Oh well, later on yo.
