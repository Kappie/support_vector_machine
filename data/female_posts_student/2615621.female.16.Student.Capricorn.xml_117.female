They had the best food and the waiter dude was HOT. lol its a really nice place. We talked about all kinds of stuff...she brought up a lot of stuff i wouldnt really wanna talk about, and she shared with me how her was treated by her mom..her mom, my aunt holt, kicked her outta the house her junior year and wanted nothing to do with her..sound fimilar? by the end of our conversation both of our eyes had filled with tears. she must know how to hold hers back better than i do..i was sittin there in this beautiful room with tiny tears streaming down my face. She completely understood. She's been through a lot of the same stuff i have suprisingly. Shes 47..but we relate so well. She acts 16 though! haha its funny.  We then went to the mall and dad told her to just buy whatever i liked and he would write her a check when he got home. Well, i found some skirts and some shirts cuz i needed dressy things. WELL..according to kaye, u have to have matching shoes and jewerly and a purse for EVERY outfit...damn...so we went shoe and jewerly and purse shopping. OMG sooo much fun!! We found the coolest shoes, like 4 pairs and i got them all! lol i also got some orange candie flip flops and she made me promise i would go find a rockin orange shirt to go with it..haha i said okie dokie! dad agreed i could buy one orange tee..cuz the rule is, no tees or jeans until all dress clothes are taken care of.   Dad and i then went to Logans, which is like a Sagebrush. We hot a hot waiter also...lol   OMG just remembered the funniest damn thing EVER: okay, kaye is a teacher and one of her classes is "human sexuality". her mom asked her how oral sex was preformed on girls by girls and on girls by guys..omg mother of pearl..my aunt is like 60 some!! well kaye is like OMG MOM UVE NEVER HAD ORAL SEX?! AND UVE BEEN MARRIED FOR HOW LONG?! hhahahahs piss piss piss my pants!!! well kaye then says...well its just a bunch of licks and kisses. but kaye told her mom she was missin out. hahaha nice one kaye. i love her to death!!   Kaye also eats katsup on everything like me..lol and my dad says breakfast the way i do..brack-fast hahaha not break-fast. lol oh well...funny stuff. anyways, im having a great time with kaye and dad. usually its just those 2 i enjoy being around.   *much love*
