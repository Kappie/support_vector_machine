My sentences sometimes even confuse myself.   God, that message just killed me.. and finding--oh fuck it.  I look at some of the reasons we broke up, and I remember how easy it was to get a kiss. And now I struggle for a remote amount of attention.  And this: "She's flirting with Keith again. I think it's funny." I think it's lame. Sarah knows me no longer. Oh god... the things I could forget. Do I all of a sudden have regrets?   "I only make jokes to distract myself from the truth...."  Stoned and Alone. And sitting thinking about everyone, everything.   "Is there anything worth waiting for? Is there anything worth living for?"  I hate hospitals.
