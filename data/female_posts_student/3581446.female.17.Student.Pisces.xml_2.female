I was discussing said website with a friend, like so:     Me:    Vespa est entré dans l'histoire non comme un simple scooter mais comme un "mythe", une façon d'être, de penser et de s'exprimer.  Ah, only French could bring such dignity to a website on scooters.   Me:   If Sartre had rode on a scooter, he would've loved that.  The image of  urlLink Sartre  on a  urlLink scooter  struck me as funny, so I decided to make it the new motto. :)   -Jean
