She recieved my extreamley long letter and is going 2 sit down with a cup of coffee next to the fire and spend the whole weekend reading it. Hehe. I said "I love you too" when I got off the phone and Callum thought I was talking to my boyfriend. When I asked him who my boyfriend was, he thought Monty! Just because he's come 2 my house a couple of times. Hahaha. Sorry butI find that hilarious. Younger brothers are funny things sometimes.
