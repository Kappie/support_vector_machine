Got up around 6 pm, talked to Simon without fighting, had steak. All around fulfilling day.  I can't wait until I have money. I have soo many albums I want to buy: Franz Ferdinand Incubus-A Crow Left of the Murder Avril Lavigne-Under My Skin Blink-182...I don't really know the name, it's the one with Down on it.  So yeah, tha's about it for now.
