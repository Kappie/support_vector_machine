But the main reason I'm writing this is because I have a problem.  A Degrassi: The Next Generation problem.  I'm watching the episode that my mom  sent me from the U.S. on home-recorded DVD  and there was an ad for a contest to be on Degrassi!  So obviously, I go straight to  urlLink the-n.com  and check out the rules.  Of course, you have to be between 12-17 to enter the contest.  So no dice, sadly.  But if anyone in that age range happens to read this before October 1, 2004, please enter on my behalf.  (Not that I couldn't pass for 17, apparently.  I get carded at pubs here all the time.  And the drinking age is 18.  I had to show ID a few weeks ago when I bought an 18* rated movie.  The high school kid at Virgin Records asked me how old I was when  buying movies.   And I thought smoking was supposed to cause ageing of the skin.)   * 18 : movie rating that I always assumed was kind of between R and NC17.  I don't really know, though, because the movie that caused all the kerfuffle was Interview with the Vampire.)
