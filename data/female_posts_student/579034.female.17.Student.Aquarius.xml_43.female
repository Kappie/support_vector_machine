Deb almost hit a lady when she was turning and when I had pulled into the school, like, I thought the gas was the break and yea you figure out the rest... Thank God the instructor had his foot on the break or else like 5 people wudda died. Yea so that was my day. I'm gonna stay in tonight. I don't have much a choice my mom just got home and said my room is a mess and I have to stay home and fix it. Stoopid Monkey. Track tomorrow. Pray I do well. And pray that Mickey's party goes well cause he just told me that if anything like bad happens then his moms not gonna let him come to the ND game or Chicago on Friday night. I think I would cry.. like... really bad.
