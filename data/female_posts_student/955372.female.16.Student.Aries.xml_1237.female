For a moment, everyone was silent.  Then the snickers started.  The guard completely lost it and doubled over laughing.  It probably saved his life, because  he'd been about to draw his gun.  He couldn't have drawn and fired before the thief got him. The thief ran away and is still at large.  In memory of the event, the bank later put a plaque on the wall engraved "Freeze, mother-stickers, this is a fxxk-up!"  Once again, I love the Darwin Awards.
