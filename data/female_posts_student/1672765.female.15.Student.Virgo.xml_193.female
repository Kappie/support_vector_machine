I need a really good night's sleep because I have my SOL tomorrow for Algebra II. You know, you have to get a "good night's sleep" before a big thing like that. And eat a good breakfast and all that jazz. I used to eat breakfast every single morning and knew how important it was and told other people so.  But the end of the year...I do less and less homework, I just don't care and do sloppy half-ass jobs on all my school work and I sleep later and later. I wake up and just am too lazy and tired to get up and go eat so I just lay around, trying to get a little more shut-eye, then get up, get dressed and by then it's time to leave and I go.  I used to have my alarm at 6:20 now it's gone to 7:15. Haha. Pretty bad, huh? Actually...now that I think about it...I could set it a little later if I really wanted to (I do). It takes me maybe 5 minutes to get ready for school. Find some clothes that are reasonably clean, throw them on then grab my book bag, and leave. Simple.   I am worried about my test tomorrow. I hope I'm not dead tired.   I need to do my Latin homework. Luckily, I had time to do my essay earlier so I don't have to do that now. I'm going to do my latin then I'm going to bed. Bed bed bed bed. Sleep sleep sleep sleep. Lovely, lovely sleep. Lush pillows and soft sheets. Gentle breeze from my ceiling fan. Quiet whirl of the fan. Annoying rattling from my fan. Stupid fan. I don't know what's wrong with it. Anyways, back to my lovely fantasy. You know that moment you lay down in bed and it feels so good to relax after a long, long day. Laws! Sleep is nice.    I've been having the Huck Finn dialect in my head since we've been reading/read it. Everytime something happens I think either "Laws" or "Landsakes" and other Southern dialect things. It's crazy. I shouldn't say it either, being already in the South and all.     Music: Made-up Dreams - Built to Spill
