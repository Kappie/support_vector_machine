I woke up @ like 9:30. which is really early for me, then i watched the movie "Don't Say A Word" good movie. and I'm glad bc Colin is going to work with my dad now so it's just me and Cole so that's nice. Cole made me so sad today, he said i was turning into a "bad" kid, uhh what's that suppose to mean just bc i said "pissed" infront of him makes me a bad kid, well that would make sence I guess bc I never ever cuss in front of him. But then we rode are bikes to the libary how cool is that.. I got the book Amoung the Imposters haha im cool.Then I played basketball outside with Ben and Blake, those kids are soo cool.Then i was going to take a shower and so i moved this mirror and i broke like a little bit off and i cut my self so then i was bleeding all over, and breaking a mirror means 7 yrs bad luck! o shit, what have i gotten myself into!lol. then i took a shower got ready for my softball games. So we went to Koch to do batting practice, then we played are games.i had NOO idea i was going to be pitching, but we have no fuckin good pitchers so he wanted me to try it, and wow i pitched the whole 9 inning game.. and we won FINALLY 21 to 16 man i was so happy. the second game went horrible i got hit w/ the ball in the ankle and its soo bruised it hurts so freakin bad. so i had to sit out but then i wanted to go in so i told him to put me in left field and i made some awesome catches there. i dived for the balls woo it was fun! and then we went to MCdonalds yummuy.. saw cammie and kallie said hi to them. there cool. n now im here icing my ankle it hurts like hell. and now we're going to watch mystic river..so i will catch ya all l8tr!
