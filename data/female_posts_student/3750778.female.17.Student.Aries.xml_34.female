The thing is, last year we went to the same conference and got all hyped up on Jesus, but the passion only lasted about 2 weeks, which was just pitifull. We didn't understand that we couldn't just go on doing everything the same old way. And we pretty much just ignored God when we found something more interesting. After our Fire died, we tried our best to act like it was ok, but there was no denying the fact that we just didn't have that passion. This year we went with expectations that we would be changed from the inside out. That we would get so consumed by God, that there would be no turning back. and that is just what happened. Now all I want to do is just bask in him, and love on him, and just be with him in everything I do. OO If I could express to you what God has done for me maybe, just maybe you could get a glimpse of why I feel so strongly about Him. I have given Him complete control over everything that I am. God isn't about religion, he is about a personal relationship with his people. That is why our church is non-denominational, we don't believe that the Church that the bible talks about is seperated into baptist, methodist, and blahblah, we believe that it is a united body of "God Chasers" who want nothing more than to glorify the Lord.  heehee okie thats all.... for now.... aha  *Hinds Feet on High Places is a really really good book*
