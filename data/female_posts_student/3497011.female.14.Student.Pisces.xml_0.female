I've learned over the years that I'm just not a science or math type of person at all.  I don't mind math as mush though, besause in math, I have a hard time and I want to pay attention so I can try and undersstand.  Science is a whole nother story.  While looking back over my notes, I learned that during sceince is when I spend the most time drawing and writing silly things like this.  It's a lot of fun to read all that I was thinking.  Science is the only class I've ever fallen asleep in too.  Not that it really matters, cuz there's nothing I can do about it, I still feel bad.  NOT!
