(I have to be ready about two hours early to keep me happy) I'm waiting for my Dad to get out of the shower. Ok... so I am a little bit obsessed with having a shower! Yeah, but isn't every one? It's a bit stupid really, cause all we're really doing is washing away our natural hair oils and those oils wash the hair naturally so it's a bit stupid! If you leave your hair for long enough it washes itself! Hmm, fascinating huh? (Nope!) Yeah... Eek, Quasar! I'm afraid that I'm gonna be rubbish at it and walk into mirrors like Emma did! Hehe, I'll be the person who's nattering away to themselves. Okay big thing: don't scream. That's like waving a white flag and shouting "YOOHOOO! OVER HERE!" Got it Laura? I'll probably be really jumpy though! I am when I'm all tensed up! Hehe... then afterward we're gonna eat then go see Ice Age! Cool! It's like totally adult scary thing followed by the stupidest kiddy film that we haven't watched yet! (Not that I err...watch those types of films (*IZZY*) Hmm...I better go do stuff! Bisi!
