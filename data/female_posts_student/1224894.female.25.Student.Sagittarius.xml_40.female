Uncle Jorge, as I fondly called him, was the person who introduced me to my current Boss and adviser. He wanted me to follow his footsteps and wanted to mold me into becoming a politician someday. Dili nako malikayan nga mahinumduman kadtong mga panahon nga iya kong hangyoon nga mag-emcee…every time, kung iya nang panahon sa pag-sulti, akong linya mao gyud ang…”walay pabor-pabor, akong Uyu-an, pinalanggang Kapitan sa barangay.”  He led our barangay for as long as I can remember...when I was still in high school, he was already the Barangay Captain and until his death, he's still the Father of our small barrio...  He may have had his shortcomings, but he was only human. He also commits mistakes...still those mistakes were compensated with the goodness of his heart and the sincerity in his job. He may have been a lot of things, but, I can safely say, he wasn’t corrupt, kay kung corrupt pa ang akong uyo-an, dako na unta siya ug balay, sin na unta ug konkreto.   Apan, sa gisulti pa, ang mga tawo, kung pakit-on sa bond paper nga puti, dili man makakita sa kaputi-on kung dili didto man sa puntik nga gamay. He had projects for Kinabjangan that will never be forgotten, like the gym, and the barangay hall. Dili sad siya mamorhisyo sa nakataas pa sa iya nga dali-dalion ang iyang mga proyekto kay tungod daghan pa daw mas dakong problema sila, whether it’s the mayor, the governor or the Congressman.   My Uncle is a great man! If not for his diabetes, daghan pa kaayo siya plano…pero, kinahanglan na sad daw niyang magpahulay kay gitawag na siya.    His death brought tears in our eyes...and the feeling of emptiness always comes through, yet, I’m sure he's glad he finally found his peace since he was already suffering greatly from diabetes...and getting tired of all the hassles of being the Barangay Captain after the amputation of his right leg.  Those were trying times for him, yet he remained a stalwart figure of leadership in Kinabjangan, and even though he already stood up on his prosthetic leg, albeit unsteadily...his calming presence makes everything run smoothly.  Uncle, you've left us with your legacy...may you find peace at last in the arms of our Creator...you will always be in our hearts...remembered...missed...and loved...till time and times are gone.
