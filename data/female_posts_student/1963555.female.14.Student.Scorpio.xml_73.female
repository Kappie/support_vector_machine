Then me and Ashlee (that's how she spell's it I'm not that stupid). And there is 5 days of school, so every day someone is assigned to throw away the garbage. I'm thursday, that's all I remember. Well Dacia was today and I came up with the idea that one of us would challenge the "garbage person" everyday, (that way we all got a chance to get outta throwing all the nasty food shit) to a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors Shoot". So we tried it all lunch. We were laughing so hard it was awesome. I challenged Dacia and she came out with Paper, I got her with fire. Then we started all doing it and Jakie put in dildo, Ryan bomb, Ashlee water, Dacia hairy toes. It was stupid stuff like that. The whole table was dying. I think that's our new table game.  We have alotta lunch fun. Our table is next to the soda machine, for some reason it isn't on durring lunch though, but anyway, at least once a week some one walks over to it to try and use it, we all whisper "we gotta show look!" and stare at the hopeless stupid person trying to get a drink. then we clap when they read "machine turns on at 12:30". Good times, gonna suck next year when we all get split up.
