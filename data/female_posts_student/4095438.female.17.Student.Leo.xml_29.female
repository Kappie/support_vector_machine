The skeptic in me says "what a load of crap/waste of time" but the mother in me (waaaaaaaaay deep down in there) says it would be kinda cool to have a secret (for all intent and purpose) language with my baby. I guess if I had time and/or energy I would give it a go.  There was a 24-page Olympic liftout that I snagged from the  Seattle Times  today. I searched frantically for any news on the Australians but all I could find was a couple of references to and photos of  urlLink Lauren Jackson  (Australian women's basketball team) and an article about the rivalry between Ian Thorpe and  urlLink some American  in the mens swimming.   It does seem like I picked a bad year to spend the year away from home, what with my 18th birthday and the Athens Olympics. I'm going to have to stay glued to  urlLink The Australian  website to get regular medal tallies and news on the plight of the Australians. I can't wait to go to some events at the  urlLink 2006 Commonwealth Games , even though everyone knows it's not the same.  xo
