"single/attached?"                                          "pic?"                                          "wt/ht?"                                          "stats?"                                          "open?"  i wunder where all the fun ppl disappeared to. mayb they too r getting sick of tis kinda shit. i dun blame them. i mean..   just look at the main of the channel n u c ppl 1 - selling themselves            "any gals single like            sport bike or car looking            for bf"              2 - selling 2nd hand goods            "i'm selling samsung           E700A msg me if u wanna           buy~ it's a new set..."                      3 - telling everyone how helpful they can b           "any gers ere need some duit can            msg me thanks u!"    n the list can go on. im just too lazy. as usual. sian arh. double happiness starting soon.
