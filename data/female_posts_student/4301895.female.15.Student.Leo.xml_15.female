Why is it so If within this expanse It is the more beautiful things that break most easily Rescue me  If you are to change into a spirit Take me away with you Unsure of what is to come I let out a voice while crying Please don't leave me here all alone Life is too short and You are truly gone and I want you to embrace me again You were the only angel The wind blows and I don sorrow Like feathers and am sent flying away Air and stars To a land so pure and unknown to anyone Where only such fleeting things gather An undescribable world, a blue and clear light Everything is delicate like glitter and What is truly precious Is unrecognized by anyone and Is small if taken in the hand and Is lost and then fades away Why is it so If within this expanse It is the more beautiful things that break most easily Rescue me  If you are to change into a spirit Take me away with you I dont sorrow Like feathers and am sent flying away Air and stars To a land so pure and unknown to anyone Where only such fleeting things gather	   ~A memorial to Danielle~
