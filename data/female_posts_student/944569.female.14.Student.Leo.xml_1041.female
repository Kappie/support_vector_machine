And I'm gonna write an essay to my Mom about why she should let me triple pierce my ears and then I can probly get it done (she let me pierce my cartillage so I'm sure she'll let me get a few more piercings)!!  Oh, and speaking of piercings I'm putting a hoop in my cartiallage one this Sunday and then it'll be there Monday at school.  Don't you think piercings are just the best thing in the world??
