Today - A little post-class meet-up with the fam.  They are all going to the ballet, while I wallow in the depths of Criminal Procedure.  But I will be meeting up with them afterwards at their hotel, just to say hi.  Wednesday - Meet Grandma, sister and her new fiance (I say this not to indicate that there is an old fiance floating around somewhere, but merely to indicate that this is relatively newly fianced) for a little TKTS action in the morning.  Pretty much looking for whatever is available, though I kind of want to drag them to see  Assassins , even though I've no hope that any of them would either like or appreciate it.  But they'll be better than all the other old folks that usually attend the matinees, so I think it'll be OK.  Or we'll just go see something else.  Sigh.  Then, it's skipping class and going off to the ballet again.  American Ballet Theatre doing Swan Lake.  Yawn.  But I've never seen a full version of it live, so it should be educational, if nothing else.  And not nearly as boring as Administrative Law.  Thursday - Hopefully, lunch with the whole fam (and fiance, of course - but since he's very nearly family already, he's included) and Christina (heck, who am I kidding, she's family too, since most of my family is more excited about potentially getting to see her than they are about getting to see me) someplace fun.  This will work out because I want it to, and will bend everyone to my will.  Then, that night, probably skipping class again (I know, I know, you're silently thinking to yourself that I'm a lazy student - and you would be right) to go see Movin' Out.  I've been wanting to see it for a while.  The kicker is that I actually know someone in the show, and since the lead dancer guy got hurt, the guy I know is filling in for him.  So I really don't want to miss it, so I think it's going to be bye-bye to Criminal Procedure.    Friday - Not sure what's on the agenda, besides a Mets game.  I've never been to Shea, and any team is better than the Yankees, so it should be fun.  Saturday - The fam leaves and my life returns to a state of semi-normalcy, i.e. boring.  Aren't you glad you got to read all of that?
