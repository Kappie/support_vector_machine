Katie hasn't called me yet. She better! She said she would. Deanna hasn't called me either. She didn't come to my graduation party on Saturday and she never called to say why. I know exactly why. She went to Candace's party on Friday night and got drunk. Oh well. She's only hurting herself. She's probably not calling because she thinks I'm mad at her. I'm only mad that she didn't call, not that she didn't come. Well, I have nothing more to say at the moment. I'm gonna go straighten my hair. Adios!
