I left like 6, maybe more, CDs in the airplane because I puked so I totally forgot to get the CDs out of the seat compartment and I just remembered last night so we called the airport and they said it's not in the Lost and Found so they probably threw it away. First of, why would you throw away something that does not belong to you, regardless of wether it was in a CD case or not?! Second of, I don't think those airport idiots know how much those CDs mean to me! I'm not going to come out and say what the value was but the CDs I remember I left there was: Toby Keith's latest album...w/ "Sweet"  "Whiskey Girl" in it Something Corporate : North Brand New : not Deja Entendu but the older one..sorry my brain is too caught up and everywhere to think of it Fall Out Boy : Take this to your grave New Found Glory's newest one and the last one was a mix he made for me..that was the biggest loss... Okay besides that whole CD thing which I'm very upset with, even if it sounds childish, I am upste with it. It just goes to show that all I'm good at is leaving stuff that I care for and losing. Anyways, all I've been doing here so far is going to the beach. Seriously, it's not even funny I feel like I go to sleep at the beach and wake up at the beach. I'm not complaining though because it looks like paradise by the ocean but..I don't know..I really though getting away for a bit would make me happy..but it hasn't, I mean don't get me wrong, I"m having fun, but I'm not really all that happy...I read her Xanga and I am the most blind fool alive but I just miss her so much, if I could I would rewind the clock all the way back and do it right...I talked to Kev last night and although I didn't tell him what was really on my mind but it helped just to talk to him. I just want to go home and sit on the rock and talk to him or talk to Ana on the phone. But anyways, I'm working on Kev's "project" it's really just a painting but, the "project" that I won't tell him about is what the painting is on. I feel like top-secret haha. On a funny note: my mom is completely sunburnt she looks like a piggy lol but I'm just really dark. Today is my grandma's birthday so we're going shopping and watch a movie and I'm buying her flowers. Yesterday I had lunch with Danielle, he's so tall now. It was nice seeing an old friend from waay back but remembering how much he hurt me in the past, I couldn't even give him a hug. I know that hanging out with him during this vacation is a step back in my life instead of a step forward which is what I need so I ended it with just the lunch. Tomorrow, I'm going to the beach again and then going downtown to shop and hopefully I'll get my baby my baby that I refer to is the Louis Vuiton purse. Okay well...I don't know what else to say...my head's thinking enough for the whole world, I'm surprised no one can hear it...g2g watch dawson now b4 I go swim then out... "...wherever you go, whoever you're with...you'll always have...a little piece of my heart..."-dawson's creek
