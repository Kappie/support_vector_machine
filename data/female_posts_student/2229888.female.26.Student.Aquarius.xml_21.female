I just can't decide . . . maybe y'all can help me . . . WHAT oh WHAT can i "be" for Halloween??   Yes, I do still "dress up" for Halloween . . . I never said i was mature, and if I did, I lied . . . I still go trick-or-treating sometimes . . . I'm usually a vampire, and that's probably the route I'll take again this year . . . I'll hafta take some pics so y'all can see what a blood-sucking b-tch I am . . . :)  Anyway, If you have any ideas, email 'em to me, and I'll post 'em in an upcoming journal entry (:  UPDATE: the vote was overwhelmingly "CAT" . . . so . . . i was a cat and i got the crap scared out of me at a cheesey haunted hayride! what a woos i am! :)
