You wait all season for small little snow flakes to drift down from the sky. When they finally fall out and brighten your day, Do you find yourself wishing they would never say goodbye?  Then comes the day when the large drops of rain drop through the air. The day clears up, allowing the sun to gleam around, Do you find yourself wishing the sun could compare?  And stays the sun for a few months to come. The sun shines down to show us our way, Do you find yourself wishing you knew what would become?  So now comes the time when autumn begins. You go through the cycle all over again. Don't you find yourself wishing you could skip this year and await the next to begin?
