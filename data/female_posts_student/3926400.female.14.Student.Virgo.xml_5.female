I did play my Mom's guitar a little over the weekend, but otherwise, I haven't picked it up. -sigh- and I haven't picked up the book I'm reading much.  But on the plus side-My legs are sore and I think I made Sebastian pissed at me just now.  I think I always write in this when I have a headache. But you guys (whoever that is really) have to deal with it, not me. Oh I'm just so nice aren't I. . . . . Forget it.
