I just feel so helpless at times; I mean I am supposed to be a good wife while he is away but what is there for me to do? I have no household to maintain and I don’t have a family to care for. Even though I moved back in with my mom I just feel like I have failed as a wife. All there is for me to do is sit and wait. I mean of course I need to live but besides school and work what is there?   I guess what I miss the most is waking up next to him. I remember the times when he would wake up long before me and just lay there looking at me. I would feel his eyes on me and slowly awaken. He would always say something like “Good morning beautiful” and that would make me smile the biggest smile ever. He always knew how to make me smile and forget whatever bothered me. I miss him so much that even though I look fine on the outside, my heart aches on the inside. I just feel so alone. I could be in a room filled with people, but none of them are really there to me.  I wonder if he feels the same way?
