People not ordering French Fries but Freedom Fries....  poeple boohing national atems...  people acting like children.  What the heck is this all about.  We are only here for a very short time to start with and we find petty things to fight about.   When someone shows you love, friendship, help or prayers. Take It...For the longest time, I didn't and regretted it.  I find myself in situations where I am greatfull for the hand that is there to help me.    Think of what is happening and see yourself help and caring lots more...  On this Oscar night................Be good.
