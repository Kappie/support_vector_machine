The last time I was in the middle of walking down the hall to the bathroom and managed to slam into a wall. Now my nose hurts. Bah. My dads at work so I'm stuck in here with my mum. She's been dithering around lighting candles... then leaving them in the worst possible places, like on top of counters with papers all over them and one about a foot off the ground on my guitar amp. The sad part is that while she was doing this I had been putting battery powered lanterns in actually useful places. Good lord...  Anyway, during the last power outage I was lying on my bed attempting to read by flashlight when my cell phone rang. The conversation went as follows: "Hello?" "ZWITTER!" (German for Hermaphrodite. Lovely way to introduce oneself...) "Errr..." "Relax, It's Alice. Is the power out in your house?" "Alice, the normal way to greet someone would be hello..." "Ich ben ein zwitter..." "I'm sure. Anyway, the powers quite out. Do we have school tomorrow?" "Probably not, wanna do something?" "Yeah, why not..."  God, there we have it, I'm not going to school tomorrow even if it is open. Thursdays at my high school are extremely strange anyway. Block classes are only 20 minutes long. After that I have an hour and a half of math followed by an hour and a half of Aerobics. Yeah, count me out on this one. I think I'll stay home and sleep.  Anyway, I must hurry, I think we're due for another outage. Night...
