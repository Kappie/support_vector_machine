Anyway, I had a VERY interesting conversation last night, won't go into details but involved mu Pingu, and Tom mblatantly didn't like the fact that Pingu is getting more action than him cos Tom says he's going to put Pingu and  Tony Blair in a box together and practice Voodoo on them, which is a bit unfair for me, although I woulnd't care if he blew Tony Blair up, I wolud be veyr upset if he practiced Voodoo on my Pingu, so STAY OUTTA IT! Anyways enough of that, I'm going up to school later and I think I shall wear my very mini skirt, which means I need to go and paint my toe nails! Yay papmering time! yay! Anyways see y'all later dudes. Apart from Jackie who is on holiday. Bye!
