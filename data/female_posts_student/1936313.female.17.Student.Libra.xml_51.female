The guys kept pulling out their cell phones as their friends at home txt messaged them the score for the Calgary-Tampa game. Go Flames?? Hah... no.. I don't like Calgary.  So I'm officially a quarter graduated. I say a quarter because the ceremonies are completely fake, I could bomb all my exams and really, then I wouldn't be graduated, I'd be stupid and have to stay back a year. So this week is the first half of graduation... the rest of the month of exams is the second half. Exciting, hey?  Have tickets to the new Harry Potter movie for today after the Banquet meal. What kinda geeks are we? Haha.. Oh well, it should be fun, we won't get out until like 1:30 am. woohoo!!!  I'm stalling having to get ready, which is bad, I'll be rushing around in a couple hours like a chicken with its head cut off. Oh well.  And No. I'm not going to mention anything about the issue with the ex because its not worth my time and just seeded with lies and crap. Time to move on already. Which is what I'm doing and I'm happy.  I PROMISE to try and have TONS of pictures as SOON AS POSSIBLE.... but it may be like... 3 years before I get to it! Or Sunday.. when I can take it in and get a CD done... -someone- has gone and lost the cable to hook the digital to the computer so we're just kinda stranded. This is the reason no one has seen my pictures from England yet either.  Working on it.  Until tomorrow!
