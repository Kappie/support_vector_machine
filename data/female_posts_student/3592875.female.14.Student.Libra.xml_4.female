Then after talking to him I finally went downstairs at 2:00 to eat breakfast/lunch hehe  I chilled for awhile then went to the pool to swim laps (gotta get fit for allstars) but I ended up racing up and down the pool with Dillon and some of his friends, lol he's awesome but slow (I won everything btw :) and KATELYN I GOT TO SEE CLAY WITH NO SHIRT ON! haha we're so silly! I miss you girl. You need to come to the pool with me sometime soon!!!   after the pool me and serene got ready and went to the olive garden with daddy but it was so packed we went to ruby Tuesdays instead, the food was good but the waiter was terrible. But it was still fun, there were lots of hotties and we watched some of the Red Sox dodgers game at the bar *smile* then dad took us to Barnes and noble where I bought an awesome book about a catcher for the red sox who was a spy for the Germans durning world war II, it looks awesome and I cant wait to read it, I think I'll start tonight! Then we went to Harris Teeter (THE best store in the world) haha that same dude still looks at me like I'm a piece of meat but I'm sure I will live.   I'm talking to Salina now, I'm SO glad we got things worked out, I love her so much and I missed her dearly, we're  planning on doing lots of things this summer and working out together for softball, I can't WAIT till I see her again, I love so so SOO much more than she knows.   Don't dwell in the past, it will only bring you down. Look to the future and thank God everyday for what he has done and is going to do for you.     *yawn* I'm getting pretty tired and it's only 9:30! I think I'll go take a shower and get my church clothes together!  *the best inspiration is not to outdo others but to outdo ourselves* is   it   in you?    Have a blessed Sunday everyone!    starting tomorrow I'm going to be happy.                                           Keep looking my way                                        My head is held high                                      You wanna bring me down?                                        I dare you to try...
