I felt really good today when Adam said he liked having members of my group around. Apparently we make the game fun. Too bad all of them are going to die, bwahahahaha... Yes, I shall kill them all with my toaster of doom! Anywho...  I can't wait for Saturday. All I've been told is that it involves duck tape. Kinky.   Current Mood:  Curious
