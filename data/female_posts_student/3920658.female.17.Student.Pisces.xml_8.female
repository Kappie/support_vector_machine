At least it felt so when we were walking the kilometer home to her place at 4.30 this morning.  ~:~  Yesterday started out quite good. Ellen and I met the "booze guy" to get something to drink for the evening in the park we were planning with my calssmates and some other friends. Then we went shopping and managed to find some great stuff, like a jacket for 125 kronor (That's like 15 bucks, for all you yankees out there).  I think the bad stuff started in the little Chinese shop where we stopped to buy a lighter to light the water-pipe with. Right next to the box with cheap lighters was a basket full of those Chinese fortune cookies, and I, feeling quite lucky, suggested that we should take one to predict our destiny for the evening. "You will pass a hard test, but it will make you happier". Maybe that's where we started doubting the day.  Anyway, the evening turned out to be one big, difficult test. I will here lay down our  worst moments  in chronological order:  1. At home, 20.00. Under quite dramatic circumstances,   my dad finds out I've got a water-pipe  , and goes completely mad. We have an argument, but, full of guilt and anxiety, I manage to get away and meet Ellen in the subway station.  2. In the beautiful park by the sea, 21.00.   We meet my classmates.     A classic mistake which I manage to make like, every day. My classmates are not nice, kind, or any other feeling you might associate with being good. This time it's Linda, Tom, Bianca and Anna (Look at "About last weekend" for further details about some of these people, like Linda). Luckily there are other nice people there, like my old friend Ellinor and her friend Susie.    3. In the park, an hour later. Trying to light the coal for the water-pipe,   Our lighter melts.    How stupid is that? We have to walk around the whole park to find someone who will lend us a lighter.   4. In the park, an hour later.   The water-pipe isn't working  . The smoke is thin and the taste is gone.  5. Still in the park, a couple of hours later. We find out that   our alcohol isn't working  . Sounds stupid, but though we've been drinking all of it we're not even dizzy. Somehow Linda and Anna have managed to get drunk, though, and after taking a bath with me and Tom they go rumbling around the park.  6. Taking a walk around the park with Tom to drop off his friend at the station, 22.00.   My feet are killing me.    I discover my gourgeous turquoise glass-beaded sandals has scratched up bleeding wounds on my feet. Maybe they weren't really the right thing to walk around in. I take them off and walk barefoot the rest of the evening.   7. Still in the park, about 23.00.   We get picked up by some South-African exchange students  . We're bored, the tell us the're on their way home for some after-party. The tell us they've got alcohol. We're picked up. Then they tell us that "home" means Stockholms most notorious "ghetto"-area. We think it sounds cool. How stupid are we?  8. On the motorway, half an hour later.   We ride 10 people in the car for five with a possibly drunk driver.    Ok, so he drove very carefully, but still: One mistake, and we'd be mash.   9.   We leave Anna and Linda in the strange guys' apartment  . Ok, so the after-party wasn't good. The apartment was ugly, they didn't have enough beer, and the guys turned out to be pot-smoking, horny bastards. I had to get out, and so did Ellinor, Ellen and Susie. I got a bit worried, cause it didn't seem right to leave Linda and Anna with those guys. But what could we do? They're just as old and just as sober as we, and they definitely didn't want to leave, so we just reasoned that they should be able to take care of themselves. When we left, Linda was having a go at the joint they were passing around and Anna was snogging one of the guys. With a sting of helpless guilt we left, guided to the subway by the only "good guy" (Who claimed that having beautiful girls like us in his apartment was the best birthday present de'd ever gotten)  10. At the subway station, 02.30. Ellen discovers   she's   lost her subway card   . With about 20 minutes left until the last subway leaves the station (After that, the next one was leaving at 05.30 in the morning), we decide to run back to look for it in the apartment and in the car. We don't find it.   11. Back at the subway station, 02.50. With five minutes to go before the train for the cantral station leaves, we make it back. Then, I discover   I've lost my cellphone  . The good guy swears he's seen it in the apartment, and promises to give it to anna or Linda before they leave.  12. Stockholm Central Station, 03.00. The subway that was supposed to take us from the central station was supposed to leave at 03.08, but   the train never comes  . Neither does the one that was due 'til 03.38. Twenty minutes later we fall asleep to the sound of Bob Dylan's "You belong to me" on the night bus on our way home.  Some good stuff did happen yesterday, like when the bus-driver made a girl without bus fare sing a capella in order to ride with the bus (She WAS Alicia Keys! Amazing!), when we bathed by the beach in the park, when my father actually told me I had to decide for myself wether to go on smoking water-pipe, and when Anna called me today and told me I'd get my cellphone back tomorrow. But all that can't overshadow the fact that   yesterday   was   Crappy .        I'll get over it. // Carrie
