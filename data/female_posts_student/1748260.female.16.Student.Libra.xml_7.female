Seems like this few days people like to rummage through my wallet. And the first thing people "attack" for in my wallet is my neoprints! That's why the place where I put my neoprint in my wallet will always be a mess! Esther Porkie.. looks like this time you're gonna get famous through my neoprints. Each time I take neoprint people ask who's this  that! Hmm, but Esther looks different in every neoprint! Wahaha agree so Esther? I really can see that you're a neoprint freak yea? Takes neoprint all da time.. Woohooo.. Then I also realise that many people in friendster love to say "LOVE YOU TO BITS" Haha, I thought it was love you to the core. Now its to bits eh? Sounds kinda cute. Maybe I should kinda like go with the flow  say it too or something? *Laughs*
