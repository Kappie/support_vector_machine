Came home, went back to church, then went to Coulter's house to pick up House of 1000 Corpses. I haven't had a chance to watch it yet, though. anywho, after that, I mowed the grass around the pool, hacked down a wild rose bush and a small tree. Then I pulled a pine tree out of the ground. I was really quite proud of myself, tell ya the truth. Then I came inside and took a bath, then went to Ardmore to get something to eat. We got back around 10.  I don't know what's up with me anymore...I feel so sad and listless, and I'm always wanting to sleep, but I'm not sleepy, or at least, i shouldn't be sleepy. It's an odd thing, really. And I'm always feeling like I'm about to cry. I don't show it all the time, but it's still there. I HATE SUMMERTIME!  Maybe tommorrow will be more fun. I don't get to go play tennis with Nick tommorrow, though I bet he wasn't going to be able to, anyways. Either that or he forgot to ask his parents. *big sigh* Ah well... I'll talk to you all tommorrow. tootles. Love,  Shannon "When I want rain, I get sunny weather. I'm just as blue as the sky. Since love walked out, can't get myself together. Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry."--Frank Sinatra "Guess I'll Hang my Tears Out to Dry"
