Who knows maybe it was the fact I had such wonderful dreams of A.C. last night so real that it was almost scarey but I dont care I had great sleep and woke up wonderful and in a great mood. Joey and I caught the bus today to go to Fife to check out Ashmead college. I had thought  I would be disappointed due to location and so on. It's a little over an hour bus ride there. It was an adventure to say the least. First off we get there to the bus stops and we are on the wrong side to catch the wrong way bus. Oh well we get on the right bus and get there finally find the place and the lady who was our "guide" made a cheerleader look boring to say the least. She was beyond bubbly going "Yay" and clapping her hands. I signed paperwork and will go back tomorrow with more. Tomorrow I also get a free massage. Hey one of the perks for this class is 2 weekly massages ! I wont complain that is for sure. :) *giggle* Then Joey and I had taco bell for lunch. I ate to much and feel bloated now but I am still in a good mood. Nice bus ride home. It was so nice to spend time with Joey and be able to laugh with him I think this was something we both needed. So it looks like I will be going to Ashmead college for massage starting in late Aug. The drawbacks. 43.25 a month to pay for 8 months. The total cost for college is a little over 12,000 for the year. OUCH. Grants and loans will cover it thankfully. Though I wish I could just straigh up pay for some of it. I'm not sure what I will be doing as far as the need to get other supplies that are going to be needed but that is fine because I have this feeling it will all work out.  Still nothign on a new place. But that is fine. Yesterday I called the Landlord tenant place and they sent me to fair housing due to the sound that it is a discrimination thing. I'm the only disable person here and I'm the only one asked to move so far Lol..  Hey if they can do it go for it. :) I will keep all posted on it as more comes available.   I"m going to go watch a bit of GH and call M. I feel like I'm on a high for some weird reason.
