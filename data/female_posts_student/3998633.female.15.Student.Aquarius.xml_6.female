I am not very sure when school starts but I am looking forward to tenth grade, sadly all of the good looking guys are in 12th grade now so the will be gone next year *sob sob* no more Russians, oh well.  Right now I am trying to get all of my back to school shopping out of the way, but I can't until I go to London (yay!). I hope all of my friends are doing well and are going to have a great year too.  Would write more but I am hungry, so I am going to go eat.
