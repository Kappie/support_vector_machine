Its just that my job is so boring that when I actually talk to someone at work, or when something funny happens its like - wow! Thats why you hear about it all the time! (Stupid girl)  Sooooo - today was fun, me and Emma bought incredibly cool hats and got lots of stares. Tomorrow could be scary in a fun kinda way! I'm buying a blank tape from "Oscar" ! Ok....
