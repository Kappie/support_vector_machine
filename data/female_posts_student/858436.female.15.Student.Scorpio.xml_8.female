I wasn't paying attention, and Chrissy Renick served and swacked me in the side of the head. It didn't hurt but was really embarassing. It's alright though. :-)  And who is STILL date-less for Activity Week dance? Me! Of course. Lol. Me being the freaking loser that I am. Haha. Ah well.  Going to Wal-Mart tonight to get the new John Mayer CD. I'm excited. :-)   I'm also going to Memphis tomorrow, and I'm excited about that as well.  Laterrr.
