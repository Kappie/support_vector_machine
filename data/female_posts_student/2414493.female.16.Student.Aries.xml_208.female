I was in bed thinking of old times and worrying about tomorrow's test at the same time when I had the sudden urge to call you. I knew you'd be up, and you might have your cell phone on. I didn't even remember your number anymore, it's been that long. I almost called your house by accident, but then I remembered your parents don't like disturbances.  Well, I called again, for one of those weakness chats that we haven't had in six months. And I got your message. I don't think you've changed it since last summer, when I could call you and hear it again and again and again.  I didn't say anything into the phone.  I know that if I talked to you you'd laugh at me for worrying, you'd quiz me incessantly and tell me that it'd be ok. You'd tell me about bio class and something to make me laugh. And we'd probably be talking past midnight, since that was the way our conversations used to go. And then all of a sudden we'd realize that so much time had passed and then we'd say bye. Or we couldn't say bye. You would end up hanging up because I always had so many verbal post scripts. And I would always feel slightly cheated since I'd start talking to nobody on the other line, but it would always be all right.   You know, you were the only one who could make me cry this inexplicable cry. It wasn't happiness or sadness but this silly wave of relief from reconciliation and having someone that made me cry. A few days later I'd return to my desk and find little cakes of salt. No more, though. For a while, I thought that was for the better.   I really don't expect you to ever talk to me again like we used to. That involved going through so many silly things together. I was always the emotional one; I can count several times when I was so distraught I had to call you up to stop crying. And every time I got off the phone I'd feel better, it was strange--you didn't know what I was going through and yet you managed to say all the right things. I was the one who sent you letters over the summer with no return, wanted to talk to you all the time. You can't imagine how happy I was when you told me about that first philosophy essay. But I called you back, and you were talking to someone else.  When I think of summer, I think of nights out on the balcony talking to you. I always wanted to be in Cambridge with you, what fun that would be. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I just thought too much and too wildly. Remember the journal?  Yes, remember that journal. I'm sorry it's such a terrible representation of me. How real is it? I don't know, it's not in my hands anymore. I hope it's in the trash by now. I don't know what I was thinking, but maybe my intuition was right too.  It's funny, I think back and I don't know of anyone else for whom I emptied myself out so completely. For a while, we were inseperable. And then things happened.  So I don't know what to do anymore. I won't try to disturb you again, I always felt queasy about that. But on this one night when I can't go to sleep, know that I'm still thinking about our good times.
