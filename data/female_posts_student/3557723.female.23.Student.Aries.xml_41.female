After two and a half years, I prepared for a lab properly. I even knew what was occurring and what to expect in the results. Though I think I may have freaked out the poor student that was assigned to be my lab partner. She isn't studying a Chemistry Major and wasn't too familiar with the equipment. And on top of that, there was me with about 8 pages of pre-lab summarised notes in addition to pre-lab summarised instructions in my lab book.  Now I've got to prepare for my labs next week, write up the lab I did today, pick a seminar topic for Week 10 and research like crazy, do a weekly summary for my vegie unit. And do a few readings. Phew! ^_^
