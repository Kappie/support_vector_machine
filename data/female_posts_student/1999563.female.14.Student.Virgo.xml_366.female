So I get there about Coach Linquist was like "From 15 down has to go to Heritage to play Evergreen on the open courts so we can get everyone playing faster"  So we were like okayyyy...  So when evergreen gets their we hop onto the bus with there 8 other players. Wow..their players...they talked about the sickest things I have ever heard in my life. I don't even want to type them out. They were POTTYMOUTHS!  So, we get to Heritage. Its a super coool school! I liked it a lot! They had a bunch of cool drummers playing outside. But, there were people playing on the tennis courts! Grr!! Heritage had a home game and they didn't tell us about it! Grr!!  So we were like..well..Grrr!  So we deicided to go to Evergreen. When we got there..wow. Its the ugliest grossest school I have EVER seen! eew! there was like mold on the courts.  So we start to play and all is jollly fine. Haha. There benches were made out of fiber glass and the people on my team were like "Don't sit on them! Last year, everyone got a rash when they sat on them!!" So I was like alrighty... :)  It was finally (well, it didn't tqake that long) my turn to play. So I start the game and I begin to feel sick..really sick. so like my serves were totally off. I was not having a good day by any means. So, as the game preceeds I feel worse and worse. The horrible part was, when I hopped out of my dads car, I dropped my water bottle and I didn't notice so I had noooo water! I thought I was going to faint. Then, the girl goes WHACK and hits me right on the chest with a zoooming ball. I was like "OOOOOOOOOOOWWW" I almost died. Seriously, I like fell over.  Then, the baseball batting cages were RIGHT next to the courts so all the baseball boys were like staring at us...*akward*  But, even through all this tragedy.. We still won! Yay!  now I am 3-3!  We have another game tomorrow, me thinks, so hopefully I will feel better so I can play together! Now I have to clean. YUCK!  Save me..  Laura Fantora
