The only thing is that I really doubt I'm going to have the time to finish Jane Eyre by a week from today.  I don't know--it could happen.  I just hope there's not a huge quiz on the very day that we get back.  That is a lot of material.  Maybe we'll just have a test.  Or a project, would be much better.  The major projects I actually enjoy.  They help my Kifner grade. I will be glad to get out of town, and get some fresh air.  And I won't have my mother hounding me to wear more sunscreen. AHHHH, I have to face my dose of physical abuse for the week.  Well, it's not THAT bad.  It just hurts my back, and my hands from stretching my fingers too far.  Last week my dad was late to pick me up, and I had to sit there while my teacher talked my freaking ear off.  Oh, my dear LORD.  He's my mom's friend though.  And she won't be late.  The only good thing is that he will never, ever hit on me.  Ever.  He is as gay as they come. Alright, I gotta jet off to my lovely pianoforte.
