X-( I've also come to a realization, I won't survive this damn summer. I'm likely to bang my head into a wall or suffer a mental breakdown. I'm pissed to the point of tears, she never gives me a break.  She sometimes gets me thinking if i'm loaning this body from her and if i don't follow her rules I will damage her goods. She never treated my sisters this way, and their hair looked worse than mines does today. She's just being hard on me cause i'm the youngest and the one most likely to leave home after college with absolutely no money. (And its exactly what I plan to do)  Peace and not so much love 3
