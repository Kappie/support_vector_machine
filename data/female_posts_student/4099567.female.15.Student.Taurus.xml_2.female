She, of course, had to go back inside immediately because she forgot something. Ah well. Allison isn't here yet, not surprising, according to erin, Tracy's getting a ride with ashley, and they're probably lost in North Granby somewhere. Okay, well, I'm at the library waiting for them to arrive. I started a new story. "We: The Undersigned". About this woman who sells her soul to the devil, and then she and all the other sold-souls band together against the devil. w00t.  La'ers April
