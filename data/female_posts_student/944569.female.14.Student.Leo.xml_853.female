Squidward makes me laugh so hard when he laughs because his nose shrinks and deflates all the time (don't worry, Fruitcake, it's not you, it's a character from Spongebob Squarepants so stop telling everyone i have your picture in my folder.  lol.  I'm not obsessed!!!!) Did anyone know that Squidward has a brother/rival named Squilliam?  They look the same except Squilliam has a black, thick unibrow....
