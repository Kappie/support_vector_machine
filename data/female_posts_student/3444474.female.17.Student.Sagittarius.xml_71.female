I can't believe it's almost here. I've been waiting four years to finally move out of my house and be on my own. And now I'm doing it in almost two weeks. I'm scared, and nervous, and really really excited all at the same time.   I dunno what I'm going to do with all that freedom, lol.  In other news, I have to re-format my iPod. Teh suck. Oh well.  Not much else is going on right now. I'm gonna go play with my laptop some more :)  Yay me :D
