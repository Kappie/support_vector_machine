Man, that's gonna be some major kick ass-ness. That's all I can say. Honestly, it's only because that's all I know.  Leaving for vermont saturday. The angels are singing. Thank the dear God above. Vermont. Oasis is good. I still want to cry though. "I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now. And all the roads we have to walk are winding. And all the lights that lead us there are blinding. There are many things that I would like to say to you but I don't know how. Cause maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me. And after all, you're my wonderwall."  Such a good song. Sad though. At least, in my current frame of mind. I am irritable. So tired. Headache.  Lonely. I know I didn't really have anyone to begin with... but still... Maybe a short bikeride will help. Yes. That would be nice.
