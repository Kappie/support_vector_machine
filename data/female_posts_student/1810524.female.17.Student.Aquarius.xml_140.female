(not that i hold grudges!) he didnt put the effort in with me like he should've! like pete does! he actually makes me feel special! its just me and change...saying goodbye....althought we havnt been together for ages, its like we were kinda spirtitually together, so in a sence i was breaking up with him...so i jus tfind it hard to tlk to him now because i automatically think or the good times and not the bad times, and theres actually almost as many bad times as there are good! which is really really not what i need! so i need to just....get my head round him not being around, even as a friend...coz i no it's for the best!   *hides in the corner with chocolate in tears*  Vx
