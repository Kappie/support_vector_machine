And I think I'm going to Meg's tonight for a cookout.  Who knows.  I mailed a letter to Jordan today...gah i miss him.  It really sucks that we can't hang out this summer b/c he's in NY like the whole time.  Well, I'm gonna go play guitar.  And I've got this song stuck in my head:    I took off for a weekend last month  Just to try and recall the whole year  All of the faces and all of the places  Wonderin' where they all disappeared  I didn't ponder the question too long  I was hungry and went out for a bite  Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum  And we wound up drinkin all night  It's these changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes  Nothing remains quite the same  With all of our running and all of our cunning  If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane  Reading departure signs in some big airport  Reminds me of the places I've been  Visions of good times that brought so much pleasure  Makes me want to go back again  If it suddenly ended tomorrow  I could somehow adjust to the fall  Good times and riches and son of a b**ches  I've seen more than I can recall  So many nights I just dream of the ocean  God I wish I was sailin' again  Oh, yesterday's over my shoulder  So I can't look back for too long  There's just too much to see waiting in front of me  And I know that I just can't go wrong  ^Jimmy Buffett
