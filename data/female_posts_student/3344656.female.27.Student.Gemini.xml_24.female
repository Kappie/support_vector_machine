Let's try again:  "It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder." - Jeff Buckley  "As you tried to describe the taste of a mouth with a dream inside." - Great Lakes  "Well if you think of this girl and the dreams that made her, write your secrets on hornet's nest paper and blow it high across the border." - Dar Williams  "I've been wondering what you meant when you asked 'Do you have a light?'" - Ani  "Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I love you for the rest of your life." - Neutral Milk Hotel  "'Cause it's written on the body, it's on the tip of our tongues." - Johnatha Brooke  "I love you oh so well like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  I love you oh so well enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell." - Dave Matthews  "we laughed because the world is absurd and beautiful and small." - Ani  "Sometimes even music cannot substitute for tears." - Paul Simon  There's a million more, but that's all for now.
