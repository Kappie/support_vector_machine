We was in the middle of tellin me a funny story and of course there was this really funny part and of course the sprite I was drinking came out of my nose. He laughed and said "Soda came out my nose" IS.J.(inside joke) so to be stupid I turned I and made soda fly over to where he was and he got it all in the face. So then as we walk his walk ahead of me and acted like he does when something's wrong so I walked over to him  asked what was wrong and of course he said nothing but I still knew that there was someting wrong. Then he told me and I didn't understand why he got mad it was just to be funny and it's not like I meant for it to get all over his face. So, the rest of the night he was like quiet and everything. So, I don't know anymore. I'm just I don't know the word for it. I was only being stupid. Anyway's that's not what got me upset it was the fact that I don't know. I know now it's I need to do something fun in my life. So, that's why I'm hoping I can go to my cousin's that and so I can get out of town. I know if I go to Worcester that i'm gonna come home feeling so much better. Well, Talk to you on Monday LaTeR!
