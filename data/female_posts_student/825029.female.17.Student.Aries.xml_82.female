God has truly blessed us with this miraculous soft drink.  vanilla coke heals all wounds, cures all diseases, and is freaking GOOD!  i could live off of it.  so the next time you're wondering what on earth to get me for my birthday/halloween/thanksgiving/christmas/st patricks day/labor day/lincolns birthday/"take your kid to work" day/any other holiday, a 6-pack would be greatly appreciated.  aaaand thats all for now.. i gotta go write an essay for "to kill a mockingbird".  hopefully i'll get back in the swing of updating this blog daily so you guys can get in on all the excitement in my life!
