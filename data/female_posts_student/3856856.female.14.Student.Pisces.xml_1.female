"the blog" is back! oh, how i missed it...  today emily vargo, nate, jeff, and i went to indiana county's friendly man-made beach, also known as yellowcreek. the water was somewhat cold, but a few spots were really warm (creepy). we had mud fights and played on the little playground. we also bought an inflatable beach ball and played volleyball with it. we took the ball in the water and started playing "monkey in the middle" with it (yes, we were reliving our childhoods) when this little 7-year-old girl swam up to us and kept asking us to throw her the ball. she was really annoying and we tried to ignore her, but she started asking our names. jeff told her his name was jesus, nate was jebadiah aka todd, i was betty lou, and emily was sue. it was a lot of fun and i got tan so it was a good day.   now i am sitting here on the computer, talking to my friend zack from florida. i met him last night and we talked all night. he's 16, he surfs, he's on the football team at his high school, he plays paintball, and he plays bass in a band (they won 3rd place in battle of the bands last year). he also sent me a picture and he's pretty good looking. i also made a friends with a drummer named andy and jamie from new jersey.   well i am going to go eat a lovely dinner (porkchops yuck!) and then maybe go hang out with my friends or something tonight.
