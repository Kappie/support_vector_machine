I didn’t know you COULD be that happy after 18 hours in a space 10 feet by 12 feet.    Then we got in the truck and headed back toward home.  Two miles down the highway, Matt said, “I feel as though we should do something else, since we’ve driven this far.”  So we turned around and headed southeast again; two hours later we were in Morehead City, NC, where we got a motel room five minutes’ walk from the beach.    Of course, we didn’t have swimsuits, a change of clothes, or even our toothbrushes—but that really made it all the better.  Have you ever swum in the ocean in the middle of the night with your clothes on?    We took another brief walk on the beach this morning before returning.  On the way back we visited an AME Zion church in New Bern—the oldest AME Zion church in NC!—and visited one of the many Bojangles’ Chicken (about one every ten miles, it seemed).  And of course, we stopped in Goldsboro and got another cup of coffee…
