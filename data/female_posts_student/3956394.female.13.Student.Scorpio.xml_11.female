As one my friends quoted.I responded no.Today, one i got to the pool we had pushing fights and pushed eachother into the water.Luckly, the life guard didnt see half the times we did push one another =P  (You can get kicked out for pushing other people) After pushing and swimming, we had the first break.Me and 2 other friends went to get chips,cookies, and gum from superstore which is located 2 mins away from the pool.I got the best gum EVER. (Im a gum freak person.I can chew one pack of gum a day.I love gum.Love.Gum.You get it.) So when we came back it was swimming time again.This time we were trying to splash old people by jumping off the edge and landing right beside them in the water.We had fun trying to get the oldest lady in the world wet.She was a hard one man.She didnt wanna get her precious "Sunglasses" wet.After we got ppl wet, we bugged the life guards by asking them how much they get payed an hour. =) A few actually responded.It was break time again and we ATE.We were starving.After it was swimming time AGAIN.We had races and splashed and everything else you would do in the water.After we all decided it was time to go home.We were very tired from swimming so long.I walked home in a happy mood knowing that this is how my summer is suposed to be.Once again, the only bad thing was the tan >.     Sunscreen.
