I was so nervous. It was 20 questions... I only missed one. Therefore getting a 95! YAY! Josh *really hot guy that goes there, and sits by me* and me were talkin alot today, and kinda flirting. And Clayton was kinda flirting with me. Josh took a drink out of my yummy chocolate chip cookie dough milkshake. Im not all oh my gosh, i cant believe it. It was like, wow, how weird. So yeah, it was a good class. Then my mom let me drive home from Jonesboro High School. But my grandmother wont. And I have to drive to Atlanta with Ted. I am soooo nervous about that. I'll hopefully post later.   **I miss the Awkward Romance... I wanna see Stu and Seth**
