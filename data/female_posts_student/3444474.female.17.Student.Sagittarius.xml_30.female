Hmmm..but Guster plays next week and THAT is good (needs tickets, needs tickets!!) :)  I missed Jason Mraz though, and that makes me sad.   Anyhoo, so yeah, July the 4th was good. There wasn't as much family as I had previously thought, which made for an easier time and also made it more enjoyable. no tio Papo though, that was saddening. My cousin Luli was there though, and she's always cool. :)  Then Cameron came over later. That was fun. We made smores...so gooey teehee they were yummy. And we played with sparklers, and he burned his finger, which was funny 'cuz it's totally something he would do. He also broke the downstairs screen door. He walked into it, and it came off the tracking.   We needed a new one anyhow. God knows how many times I've broken the damn thing, lol.  So anyhow, that was my day. I might go out with Cam and Andrew later, maybe not, depends on if Andrew has anything to do, in which case if he doesn't, we're out, if he does, I'm totally going to see Spiderman dos without him, lol.   Anyhow, that's all for now. :D
