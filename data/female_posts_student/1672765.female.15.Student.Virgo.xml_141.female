I was just going to go to classes in the morning then skip the whole activities and quote, unquote "fun" that's planned for the rest of the day.  Socializing? Playing games? Hanging out with friends? That's so not me. Sorry. That just has no appeal to me. If I had a friend or something then yeah, I can see how it would be totally awesome to have the whole afternoon to hang with them but seeing as I don't I won't.  That's too bad.  I just know I wouldn't have a good time. I know it would/will be horrible. But anyway, I think I might have to go. I hear the day "counts". Counts for what? I mean in relation to absenses and stuff..that's so stupid. I'm thinking about report cards and stuff where it shows the number of times you've missed whatever class. They can't add a day because I was in the class that morning, see? I don't see how they can count it.  We shall see.
