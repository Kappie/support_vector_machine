( You can tell she was glad to see us) I'm really happy at the moment as i just got back from trampolining and i can now do a back summersault into a seat drop! Considering i only passed my back summersault last week im quite proud of myself! I seem to have a bit of a cold, not a runny nose cold but a annoying sore throat, which isnt always there and a horrible throaty gooey feeling... I am also very happy cause i didnt have to babysit tonite! Which means that i have moe time to do homework.. Althoughi bet i dont do anything in this extra time i have been given. I wish i had never told people who i fancy now cause thats all they sem to go on about! Grrrr, How annoying. And no guys you aint finding out who unless i already told you or you find out from somone i told! Now this is feeling like a very long blog to me so i think i will bring it to a bit of a abrupt end.
