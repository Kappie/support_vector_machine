I had a pretty good day yesterday....until yea...anyways, Anna picked me up at 12 and we then picked up Tiffany. We wanted to spend some time with her because, today, Monday, She is going to UCLA and we won't see her for a while. It's not that far, I know but still. We went to Robeekas (Robeks) and then to Rubio's. I got a Mahalo Mango and that is all. Then we visited some friends that live across the way from Tiff. Then we helped her pack and then She took like TEN HOURS to get ready, but then we went to Art's house to Take one car and we went to Bennihannas and the rest is history.  Oh yes, David called me while at Tiff's house and indeed hung up on me. Apparently I am too concieted for him. Sorry if that's the way I came off as, but I am not. And then later when I talked to him he told me that I didn't seem excited that he called. And OH MAN I was! lol, just ask the girls if I was not smiling and jumping up and down like a fool and that was just after hearing he got home early, then he called....Whoa! lolz. But he doesn' t think we should talk like that anymore. Okaaaay.... Would you like to honestly know what I think? Here we go... I know he likes me and likes me enough to think about me a lot and to have a dream about me. Which is good because I like him too and I think about him a lot as well. It just bothers me how He gets upset at me for things and I'm like "what?!?!  :0  " One second he'll be like I've been thinking about you a lot then the next it's like uhhh I don't want to "make you fall for me" When something bothers him about me he just hangs up. What the hell?! Why don't you tell me instead of hanging up? I think it would help a lot. Don't get me wrong, I am not one to say I suppose, I don't express my feelings well when it comes to boys. I think it's because I don't have a positive image of myself, but that's a whole other story. But for the love of Allah, stop leaving like that because it makes me get all upset and I'm like..."Arg!" (chuckles) And I can't talk to you about why your upset at me so I don't know how to fix it or whatever. I have a million questions that got erased by sleep. I would of loved to ask to him but he left and I couldn't so... Whatever...lolz. I'll talk to him tonite.  Oh yea, my job... I have to tell them I want to leave on August 5th till the 10th and if it will cost me my job...I guess Las Vegas here I don't come! whoopie...I was soooo looking forward to getting away...  P.S. I have to go to work this morning, great way to start the day off....
