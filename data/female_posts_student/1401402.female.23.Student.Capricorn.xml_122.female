Sure Sakdary will come out and party with them, but just dont get me drunk drunk. Arriving at the club, parking sucks and the waiting in line shit SUCKS.. Took too many shoots and dance the nite away. I was having fun, just a great time hanging out with friends.   I must admit that i was pretty much buzzin at the time until now. As we speak i notice that i've spotted a friend which i never knew i would ever run into. Upon the reaction that i had i dared myself to go along with the flow just to say HI to a friend whom i have never really met. What a small world it is. The friend whom i was waiting to meet was Curtis.   Anyways, I was having so much fun afterwards that i totally forgot what time it was. By this time everyone was pretty much gonne gone like a crack in the joke. Its a good thing that i've got Andykisaoski taking care of me or else i would pretty much be so doom. Poor Sakdary, cant even bearly walk to the car.   I have no idea what am i blogging about rite at this moment but all that i know is that i am so buzz. Good nite everyone. I have nothing else to say. God, I hope this headache will go away....
