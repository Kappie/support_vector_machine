Jen, Crystal, Chris P. and I all went bar hoping Sat. night in hoboken.  Very good times and I can't wait to do it again next weekend! Also went to Morristown bars with Jen and Ariel on Friday.  It's a little more toned down but try telling the people that! It's creepy cuz my mom used to go to Jimmies Haunt, so I avoid that one like the plauge!  Surpringly people were more dressed up in Morristown than Hobken, usually it's quite the opposite.  But damn I looked good. Also celebrated Mine and Ross's anniversary!  We BBQed and he made cake and fondue for me!  We also exchanged gifts! I got him a wallet and he got me earrings and a necklace!  I also got him something else but it hasen't come in yet :(. It's the gift that Russ said I was such a good girlfriend for :-D.  How sweet!  I am really missing my METAL days.  I love listening to the stuff and have dreams of ROCKSTARdum but the problem is I can't sing well and I do not play any kind of instrument!... so I can always be like Courtney Love! I just play PANTERA all day and hope that by dreaming my dreams will actually become reality.  Besides I look hot in leather!!!   urlLink ps i wish you to still take my poll if you havent
