You never know when Death will come and take it away, so you should enjoy yourself while you can. I get called a Slut for having a few "encounters", yet I see it as me enjoying myself in a way that I find suitable. Also, I learned the reality of love. Love does not truly exist in the world. I mean, you may say you love someone and you may have feelings for that person, but love is such a strong emotion that I don't think anyone is capable of feeling it. My friend John tells me he loves me and, for amusement, I asked him why. He told me because I make him happy and when he's around me he feels so comfortable and he thinks about me all the time. He said that I make him feel a way no one ever has. Mind you me and John never had a relationship. He has such great feeling for me and he believes that the only way that it can be described is love. I had a boyfriend tell me that he loved me and I believed him. He said that he loved me because I made him happy. He, then, broke up with me because he no longer felt the same way he used to. Does that mean he no longer loves me? I think so. I think love is something that lasts forever and if marriage is an eternal bond of love, then how do you explain the 75% divorce rate?
