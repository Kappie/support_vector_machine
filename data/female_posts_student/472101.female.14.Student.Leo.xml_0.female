Oh and I think I figured  out how I messed up the order of one of the pictures in the last few sets. When I uploaded my last picture with Hello I didn't refresh blogger and then post the summary so the last picture ended up before the summary. I did it again only this time it was fixable since the last one required deleting and re-posting 7 pictures to fix, and this one didn't. Not that you care about this anyways...
