I remember feeling vaguely numb and clinical, but I just finished reading  urlLink "Things Fall Apart"  by Chinua Achebe and I seriously cried. My god, the self-important arrogance of colonizers. The mindset is so appallingly unaware and uncaring. They had no sense of the tragedy they were creating, they just arrogantly assumed that their way was the best way, and it would benefit everyone. But it didn't, it hurt everyone, and no one came out of the colonial system without being seriously, deeply affected psychologically.
