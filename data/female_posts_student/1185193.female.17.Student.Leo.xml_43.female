I just wish I had his courage to express my love like that.  He was truly an amazing little guy.  Except I think that girl was a bit too old for him, but I guess it goes to show love conquers all, even age.  I wish it were true for my situation, although age is not the concern.  Whatever.  It scares me how long my heart has been aching.  Is it love?  I'd say so, but in my case, it is unconquerable.  I am officially launching Mission Move On.  I will keep you posted on its progress.  Anyways, I really liked the song from the movie by Kelly Clarkson.  Here it is:  Love can be a many splendored thing Can't deny the joy it brings A dozen roses, diamond rings Dreams for sale and fairy tales It'll make you hear a symphony And you just want the world to see But like a drug that makes you blind, It'll fool ya every time  The trouble with love is It can tear you up inside Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger than your pride The trouble with love is It doesn't care how fast you fall And you can't refuse the call See, you got no say at all  Now I was once a fool, it's true I played the game by all the rules But now my world's a deeper blue I'm sadder, but I'm wiser too I swore I'd never love again I swore my heart would never mend Said love wasn't worth the pain But then I hear it call my name  (The trouble with) The trouble with love is It can tear you up inside Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger than your pride The trouble with love is It doesn't care how fast you fall And you can't refuse the call See, you got no say at all  Every time I turn around I think I've got it all figured out My heart keeps callin' and I keep on fallin' Over and over again The sad story always ends the same Me standin' in the pourin' rain It seems no matter what I do It tears my heart in two  (The trouble with love is) The trouble with love, yeah (It can tear you up inside) It can tear you up inside (Make your heart believe a lie) Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger than your pride  (The trouble with love is) It's in your heart It's in your soul (doesn't care how fast you fall) You won't get no control (and you can't refuse the call) See, you got no say at all  (The trouble with love is) Oh, yeah (It can tear you up inside) (Make your heart believe a lie)
