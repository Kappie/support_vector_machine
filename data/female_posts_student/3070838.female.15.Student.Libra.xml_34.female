Fortunately , what you say doesn't matter as much as whether you listen.   Hmm..... I wonder what could have happened today that would apply. Who said something that I replied too, but it didn't matter what I said, I should just try to read into what they said. lol.  That's creepy. Any ideas from ANYONE? lol. EMail me ppl. It's freaking me out.  I'm trying to design a workout program lol. I'm sick of running. I'm gonna work on it this evening. I want to think of something FUN to do, any ideas?  LOL, I feel the urge for underwear shopping. I know this is weird but i get the urge sometime, and we just got a VS catalog in the mail.   I'm reading YM right now, here's another one of my horoscopes.   LIBRA:  The boy you're into sends you crazy mixed signals. You wonder if you're in the twilight zone: Did you imagine those long talks on the phone? In the end--gues what?--you'll find he's not worth the trouble.  Hmm... I wonder what that means? That's kind of disturbing too. I hope it's not true lol. Makes me not want to put too much belief in these tings. God I hope thats not true.   I'm disturbed. I'll see you all later. Good Bye.
