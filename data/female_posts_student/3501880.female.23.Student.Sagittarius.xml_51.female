I haven't picked up my black eyeliner in months and months and months, and just the other day, I whipped it out of old time's sake. God, it looked like shit! It just seemed to be way, way, WAY too much!   So....I'm sorry! I never fully realized how awful it looked. But, alas, I have realized the error of my ways!
