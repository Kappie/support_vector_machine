No I know what your thinking, I did not make the tire pop. Anyway, we were supposed to be at the All-Star Hotel at three o'clock but we didn't end up making it there until five that same night. We had to get a new tire and get some things fixed in the car. We were waiting for like 2 hours. But little did we know that that was only the begining of our misadventure. We got to the hotel and ended up not being able to get into our room becasue our key didn't work. We went sweimming after getting everything unpacked. The next day we went to the Magic Kingdom, it was fun we didn't get to do much because my parents desided that they didn't want to see anything past the castle. So I didn't get to ride anything that I wanted to ride. We went home at noon so that my father could watch the playoffs. We didn't end up going back to the park untill 5 that night. We saw the Electric night parade that started at 9 o'clock, but my dad wouldn't let us go on any rides becasue he thought that we were going to lose our seats. We saw the closing ceramony that night but we weren't able to stay after the fireworks. I wanted to ride my favorite ride it is going to sound corny but I really wanted to ride Dumbo. You have to really know me in order to know why I like Dumbo so much. Anyway. We went home after that because it was getting to late for my brothers to be out. The next morning we stayed at the Hotel all day. That wasn't a very fun day. All we did was go swimming all day. Anyway the next day we went to Down Town Disney. That was heaven for me. I went shopping. Of course it was all disney stuff but still it was shopping. We didn't get anything while we were there because at the time I was kind of broke. I had spent all my money at the Magic Kingdom. WE went home after 9 o'clock That was late when your walking through a 6 mile long mall when you got there at 8 am and hadent sit down the entire day. anyway it was fun while it lasted. On wednesday we went to MGM Studios and we really didn't do that much there ethier. But what I did find out was that MGM has some realy good special effects for there movies.  We went to the Indiana Jones Show and that was really hot in the auditarium that we were in. It was actually like they were really filming the movie. after that I had to wait for hours for my brothers to get all the character autographs they could get. I think I was waiting for them for about a good 2 hours. That may not seem to long but it is when it is 97 degrees outside. Anyway. When my brother came back he started telling everyone that really wanted to go and see Fantasmic and we didn't end up going until the last that we were there. That night it got rained out. After we went to MGM we went to Epcot and for some reason the park you would think would be the most boring asctually turned out to be very interesting. Even though I was on my feet all day again. Walking through the USA portion of the park. Have you ever wondered why they have a section dedicated to the USA when you are in an American park. I would understand if you were in the Tokyo park but your not. sorry I get really anoyedf with the smallest things. But have you ever see the Eluminations it is really cool you should try to see it sometime. I swear the rain has very good timeing because as soon as the Eluminations was over it started pooring. The next day we went to the Animal Kingdon. That wa okay the Kali River Rapids was really cool it got me soaked. Anyway the last day that we were in Orlando we went back to Downtown Disney to buy all of the stuff that we weren't able to buy on Tuesday. I bought an ID Bracelet that I personally had to get inscribed becasue the people that make them are to stupid to think that some one would have the name Krsitine. You would think they would have it spelled both wasy but I also bought a Dumbo stuffed animal. It is so cute. I love Dumbo. You really do have to know me to understand. Well that was the end our journey. Of course I never did tell you about the hotel that we moved to but I wont get into the mis haps that we had there. Oh my god I almost forgot you guys have to go to MGM. The Tower Of Terror and the Rockin Rollar Coaster are so cool. Well gotta run BYE!!!
