It will be so sad next year when Chad isn't on the counsel to spice things up, but the good news is we will have an ARIS and JEN and again, CARRIE!!! Yay, oh yay, it was fun.  I think Saturday was one of the most defining nights of my life, many tears were shed and a lot was confessed and so much was settled.  It may sound like it was a drag, but I assure you, it wasn't.  It was awesome!  There were hugs all around and I was reminded that I am a part of the best group of friends there could ever be!! (both those there and those still in sioux falls).  Even though no one that went to Rally reads this... THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING WEEKEND.  I love you and goodnight.  Lizzie
