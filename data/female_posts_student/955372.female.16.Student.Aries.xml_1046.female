Oh my god that reminds me of this comedian talking about when he's a grampa... "My grandson'll be like 'grampa! do you want to come to the zoo with us?!' And I'd say 'The zoo? Fuck that. I'm not going to the fucking zoo! The zoo! What are you, GAY?' 'Gramma, grampa called me gay!' 'don't tell on me bitch!'"
