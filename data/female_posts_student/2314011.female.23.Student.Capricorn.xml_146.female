Finished the rough draft today in just under 6 hours and am feeling pretty damn sweet about it.  Not really thinking about the fact that it's 18 pages without the statement of facts or statement of proceedings and without a case my professor told me to use.  I'll worry about that next weekend after we've received insightful feedback and constructive criticism on our efforts thus far.  Then, and only then, will I set about making the final draft comport with the 16 page limit.  For now, my efforts have come to an end, just in time for one last day of Break before heading back north Saturday.    So, Mom and I are heading to Ogden bright and early tomorrow to shop our asses off, which should make for a great send-off.  I'm always surprised to find myself surprised when she has a bag of clothes waiting for me when I arrive.  But sure enough, she's been finding unbelievable bargains ever since I left the last time and has piled them in my room.  And tomorrow, we'll be searching (and no doubt finding) even more.  Chief among our duties is finding a nice summer frock for my (only cool) cousin's wedding in mid-June.  She wouldn't care if I showed up in leather pants, but for once, I'm ready to find a nice, summer-y, not-too-formal-yet-not-too-casual "something."  I have no idea what that means, but I'm convinced I'll know it when I see it.  And if it has to be a tiny tissue of a dress, so be it.    But enough about tomorrow and the days to follow; I realize it's been more than a few days since my last post and this fact pains me.  It burrnsss usss!  Okay, not quite, but I do miss my little bloggy.  When last we blogged, the Boy and I had just finished enjoying our first day off in two months.  That evening found us enjoying chips, salsa and screaming monkeys with his hot-yet-empowered pal Bridget and her hot-in-a-cute way fiancee Dave.  We decided against the fried ice cream and opted for Dairy Queen Blizzards in the back of Bridget's Honda.  It was so hot.  The next day, we set out to get work done.  The more we sat around that morning and talked about other issues, the more we thought our work wouldn't really take  that  long.  After all, I was just outlining my Civil Procedure notes, and between the  Erie  doctrine and Rule 12, what more is there?  Well, as it turns out, about 6 hours' worth, give or take a back-cracking stretch and whine for a Coke.  But, as the last of the rays descended along the horizons and the first stars made their appearance, we threw ourselves on the couch, triumphant in our accomplishments.    "Wanna go get a Coke?"  the Boy asked while flipping through Neil's latest comics.  "Yea."  I answered, not lifting my head from its den in his couch's cushions.  "Let's get some ice cream, too, and make floats while we watch more Queer as Folk."  And so it was.  We stayed up way passed our bedtimes, squealing at Brian's sweet dead sexiness, Ben's Superman physique and Clark Kent demeanor, and Emmett's fabulousness.  Then there was the preparation of Luscious Lorraine's Super Spring package.  It was painstaking and caused more than a few tears, but it was worth it....squeak!...it.was.worth.it.   Yea, all in all, the Break's been a pretty good one, and the incredible swiftness of time's passing hasn't had quite the impact I thought it would.  Maybe that's because being home feels different than it did during the undergrad breaks.  Christmas break certainly felt different than any of its predecessors, to the point that it didn't feel like a break at all.  Near the end, I had to remind myself that I would soon be returning to school, that it was time to start thinking about going back.  "Back?  Back to  what ?  Aren't I finished?  Isn't this the way things  are  now?"  It was the most difficult return back to Moscow, too.  So perhaps I've discovered how to fully enjoy being home and all that entails (even with piles of work to do) to the point where the time doesn't evaporate before I even have a chance to acknowledge the fact that I'm  on  break.  Whatever it is, it feels really great.  And as much as I'm loving Spring, Summer can't get here fast enough.
