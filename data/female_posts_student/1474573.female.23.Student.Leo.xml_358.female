I was supposed to have other plans with a girlfriend but alas, that didn't work out, so I was home.  I basically sat in the hot basement (I thought basements were supposed to be cool in the summer!) and watched  I Love the 90's  90-93, with a little  Blow Out  (my new favorite reality show about hairstylists) and  Queer Eye .  Then after that was all over, I watched a movie called  The Company  with Neve Campbell and directed by Robert Altman?  I didn't even realize that when I picked it up.  I just remembered reading something about Neve Campbell going back to her roots of ballet or something.    Anyway, I'm not done with the movie yet, but so far it plays out like a documentary.  The camera follows the dancers of the Joffrey Ballet Company around and we watch them practice and then there's a scene of the actual performance and then it goes back to backstage stuff... I mean, I can't say its boring, but so far, ain't nuthin' happenin', and I'm an hour in... It's weird. I'm drawn to it.  Go figure.  So the boys left around midnight but I didn't actually get to sleep until about 1am, and then I had all these weird vivid dreams about dancing and hairstyling. (gee, I wonder why.)  I woke up literally seeing double and I can't quite get out of the funk yet.  On a more positive note (or, maybe I should wait til AFTER they leave to know how positive it actually is) We are getting our Nephews and Niece overnight. YAAAY! 13, 11 and 10.  The 13 year old is well, 13, and therefore he's obnoxious.  The 11 year old looks much older than she is, and thinks she can get away with stuff because we'll forget how old she really is.  The 10 year old is a little ANGEL!  Okay, he's like a miniature Steve - adorable and clever.  He called me personally to ask if they could come over.  How cute is that?!?!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!  It will be a love fest.  Or it could be me gossiping with the girl while the boys play XBox with Steve.  This weather doesnt allow for much, unfortunately.
