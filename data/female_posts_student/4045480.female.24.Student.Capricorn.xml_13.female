Yep, I'm starting up my diet again, and kicked off my workout regime for the season with some Express Step Aerobics, I'm ready to rock. I thankfully am back down to my original weight before Key West, but I want to get even further down, more fat loss, leaner muscle mass, etc. So I'm heading back down to South Beach, it worked once, so I'm doing it again. This time I'm shooting for more dramatic results, upping my cardio, and adding in some yoga for stretching and toning, and will probably add in some body pump to get the weight training in. I'm excited about it.  Then there is student teaching, still nervous, still really am procrastinating on the studying part. I really don't know what I'm in for I guess. I'm sure it's going to be a constant review session for me, especially when I actually have to start the teaching part. I know I'll do fine, just there is a lot to do outside of it as well, applications, seminars, and my life too. I'll be interesting to see how I weave it all together but somehow I'll manage, I always do. That's about it for now, TTFN!
