It doesnt really matter exactly what happend... its still something that affects the way you think, and see things. first of all i see that the world is one fucked up place. no joke. wow. seriously, how can people do this to themselves. jsut the way we have been raised to think by the media, our surroundings, parents, siblings, and every random thought that humans can think to think. And all of it affects us. maybe subconciously. But being raised with pressure to aspire to have the perfect body, people in your life, perfect husband, children that you love, and a life that you dreamed of. when i'm sitting here, and i can't even get past one simple though as to who the hell i am. b.c. i'm am seeing parts now that i never wanted to see.      b.c. just the fact of what happened, I hate it. i wish i could go back and change it ALL. i want to wake up and it be friday morning. 6:30 am. i'd go through the whole day again if i could just get the chance to change a few seconds. but i can't. so i wont dwell on that. but it makes me mad. Its my fault. and I am the reason that it got thrown in the gutter.       and i am looking somehtig beautiful in the eye, and i can't do anything about it. Two beautiful people are in front of me. not even a question as to who i'm walking towards. but this other one- i would love to be a nun and try to convert him into being a better person. but i'm no saint. so im not going to try to belive that i could do that. i want to help, but i can't from where i stand. its just confusing!       b.c. i want to go to starbucks. and a part of me will want jeremy to walk through those doors. and a part of me will want what went through my head 24/7 for the last 3 months. and part of me will think of him when i start to crack a stupid joke. and all  that  kills me, b.c the other part of me wishes none of it had happened. and that we still could joke about it and be happy torturing ourselves. and that i care more about what she thinks than what i am thinking. and i know what she thinks about parts of it. so that answers what i do. but i feel so helpless when i think about it again. b.c. being given something that you want and that you dont deserve..... If anyone knows that feeling- its disgusting. i've become disgusted w. myself. and want to die. and feel selfish and a horrible person and worthless. go on and say what you want, it doesnt really matter, i'm not talking about looks. i know i'm not ugly. but that doesnt matter, whats inside is what i'm talking about. and thats the clincher. b.c. thats what i can't see, or understand. i dont know myself well enough to say. so maybe thats why i'm sitting here...doing nothing.         maybe i should do something. anything. if i was in a different position it'd be easier, but i wouldn;t be finding out more. which it acutally shouldn't take a whole blog page. its not what happened exactly. its the situation, generalized, that is the good part. thats the crazy thing. all of this is to learn. it teaches you the lessons you need to learn, thats why they happened...i guess. everything happens for a reason. and experiences help you grow and they mold you. so nothing to do with the actions that i will make when/if/for/to in the near future, but just the fact that the situation presented itself and is makeing me think about it deeper is the good part. and idk, am i a little young to have to worry about this? yes? maybe? or am i behind. and that i havent thought as much about it as i should, so this is...god's?....way of making me become a better person and wake up and learn, when the ppl around me are already good people and i just need to catch up. yes?...   And the way you seem to flow Circumnavigate in hope And they seem to lose control, with you  Everyone of us is hurt And everyone of us is scarred Everyone of us is scared  Your eyes closed  Your head hurts Your eyes feel so low  Everyone of us has hope For you
