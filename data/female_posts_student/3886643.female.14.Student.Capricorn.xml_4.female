So tonight i guess i gotta read that dern lil book! gah....then class ended. then i went to Goober's with my Mom...YuM!....I had a Jamaican Chicken Samwitch, it was Grrreat...oh yea and we had cheesy fries YUM!...After that we cam home and i lollydoodled around for about...3 hours. Then we went to Pages to order my books for the bishop reading list. I have to get Carrie, Rebecca, and Black like me....they sound ok..so i guess i can deal. I am kinda gettin excited about going to Bishop now. I've fantasized about just picking up and changing schools to go and meet new people...and wow we are finally doing that, but i guess i do kinda have to be sad because i'm leaving my friends. It's real hard tho...cus i am not in the mood to be sad right now. I am also kinda excited to move to kernersville...i hate this house with a passion. We are living beside a horse farm so i guess it's not  too bad! Anyways...Our Suckyass tv stoped working....and it pisses me off....JK...but it really did stop working...i guess you could say it broke.....SOMETHING in there must be broken, haha. I'll just go get tha one in the back room....I gotta watch real world re-runs...Right Kyle?! haha. Anyways...about 6 i went out to pick weeds for $15...i'm not done but ill do it later. While i was outside i found this g-ross earthworm and i ran inside with it and i yelled,"Mom! i found a baby snake look!" then i hurled it in her face and she jumped real high...lmfao...it was great. Well Thats about it...boring day :D....*im Out*
