I did, however, write some interestin slam in 10 minutes before the project was due:  White, and exultantly clean, ready to fly.  So pure, so undeserving of this serving, not wanting to die.  The crime you didn’t commit, sublime, and ready to hit  It haunts because you are different  And lacking of adornment  Before they see the core, they abhor you for I adore you  And because you threaten them,  Your reverence condemns all them,  Your numbers then panic them,  And threatens to deprive all them  Of this unrighteous power in an hour  Too dark to truly see through,  This vagueness washes through you,  Hitting and beating, scathing your life and your soul  As the shadows drip and slide out of control.  And you don’t see why you are not allotted  The time and right and the claim to be plotted  On this land in which you were born and raised,  Beaten and hazed,  Driven to craze,  But never then phased.  How could they blindly, wildly, snidely engrave this anguish upon you just because you long to live and breathe and see, and perhaps ultimately take wing to the sky, and finally fly. Their unchecked power and force Will lead to an end of all they endorse. It is their ignorance, their pride, For that is the locking word Who could ever bear to survive, they who kill a mockingbird.
