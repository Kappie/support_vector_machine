What does Garth have in mind, Something of which we could find. And what's on Gena's list, Just give us the jist. And a shopping we will go, To all the stores that we know. So that when on Christmas night, you find a package wrapped up tight. You'll know from a far, that in our thoughts you are. Merry Christmas! Diana ________________________________ Ho, Ho, Ho, a shopping they will go...   If it's the gist of Gena you want, try instead for little things, you know... Not partridges, nor pears, but little earrings all a glow.  Like everyday hoops or a bit dangling low.   For Garth, that artist boy at school,  think not of science nor of tool, but try Music CD's of the latest groups that are: TOO COOL! [I suggest Not too banging of the head]      Nor too soft though, he said, And Karen suggested a gift certificate instead!      Last year I got Karen an easel,   an with some paints she creates everything, except a weasel(?) Some seeds of herbals and smells of the garden, but we've got many books of the jardin, Or try something to warm her heart, and tummy too, Try a little cocoa  coffee to brew.  For Gunnar, who's got most everything how about an extractor that shaped like a spring, A corkscrew, or opener, for those corks that need a fling,  How Seussian! But not that movie, not that thing!   Oh, how merrily the words do flow, We wish we could see you, but it is a bit far to go.  Have a Merry Christmas, really.... Ho, Ho , HO
