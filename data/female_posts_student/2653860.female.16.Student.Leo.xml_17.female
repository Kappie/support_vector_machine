Dad is resigning from the Richland Academy, and here's why. Well, this is at least the straw that broke the camel's back.   The Academy got a grant, so they decided to offer HMC for free this summer to bring in new people. About 25 kids signed up. But an age-limit ws put on the class. 8th grade. And someone else is teaching it. And Dad wasn't even told.  Yeah. They just gave his job to someone else without even telling him. He found out through a newspaper article and confronted Mary Ann, because otherwise, he would have come in to teach it without knowing that the job had been given to someone else. So that's the deal with HMC, tarah. You wouldn't have been able to sign up anyway. But dad's gonna try to move it to the Arts' Center in Ashland. We'll probably have to call it something else, but it will still be HMC and it'll be much more affordable at the Arts' Center.   So that's the Deal. And I"m upset, but kinda glad, too. Stupid Powers That Be! GRAWR!
