Anyway for those who were wondering what has made me so happy... apart from those lesbianic rumblings going on in jenni's room...! I will inform you. As you may know (well, as you do know as I have already mentioned this in one of my previous thingies) yesterday, I got through some pictures of my girlfriend lucy.. Now, having inspected them for a very long time, I have decided that (apart from being a bit of a kev) she is quite cute and that I love her more and more every day!!!! Noone believes me when I say I love her but I do... step aside miss belcher, you are no longer top of my list!!!!! la di da di da... ok... enough about lucy although I could talk about her endlessly!!! :-) i need to put some pics on my blog........ how does one do that??!!! If anyone wants to see the pictures they only have to ask!! I will be happy to show you and talk about it for hours on end.... I've been playing my guitar... v. relaxing... suddenly felt the need to come and write in my blog! 5 in a day... I think I am becoming obsessed with my blog, so i am going to resist writing anymore... I'm off to moisturise my legs and play the guitar some more... oh and Deya "Who's so phoney, always surrounded? stop your screaming - noone can hear. The scars on your skin 'post no bills'.. who you were, was so beautiful, remember who you were. Hide from the mirror - the cracks and memories. Hide from your family - they wont know you now. For all the holes in our souls hots no thrills. Who you were, was so beautiful. Memories who - Who you were" I love you... remember that xxxxxxxxxxx
