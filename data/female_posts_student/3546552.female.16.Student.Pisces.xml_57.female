We had a great time watchin this really wierd movie about a lady in drug rehab...lol,  Sandra Bullock  stars in some of the strangest things. So then, at around 7 I went to  Shaun Eide's  for cell group and we all decided to go to the fireworks at  Mitchell park  in Brookfield! When we got there I saw some people from church and we all hung out together in one big area and watched the show! Afterwards,  Alli, Shaun, Sarah, Andrew R., Jason  and I went to Kopps and had some drumstick custard! Now I am home and getting ready to clean my room cuz it's drivin me insane! I can't find anything and nothing is where I remember putting it! LOL, yeah it's 1130 and I'm gonna clean...haha...o well, mom will be happy.  MR ... ngiyakuthanda ...lol, figure it out yet? I'll give you a hint...I've said the equivalent of it in French to you...   bonne nuit.  ~kendra
