But what comes with expressing yourself can come a horrible disease - the inability to see other people’s point of view.   There are all kinds of different types of music out there for everyone to listen to, and everyone has different tastes in music. But when people are talking about music, and find out that one does not have the same tastes in music, they can lash out, either verbally or physically.  Some people like wearing black clothes. Other like wearing preppy clothes. Some others like a totally different style. People will gang up and destroy the minority’s opinion, and right to express themselves.  The world would be a much better place if everyone was able to look outside their believes and see things the way someone else might. Atheists looking at what Theists believe. Punk rockers seeing the world through a classical eye. But it is a gene, a disease that is almost incurable that destroys some people’s individuality by not seeing why they do what they do.  Critics are open-minded. They have to be. Movies, art shows, exhibits wouldn’t survive without someone reviewing it and giving their thoughts. And if these critics were judgmental and biased in any way, then one might miss an opportunity to see something truly amazing.  If people starting thinking outside of their box, and looking at others, then maybe opinions would be shared and appreciated more, battles wouldn’t need to be fought and everyone would be happier.
