A lot of people were saying they liked it today + didn't believe that I actually cut it.  But I did.  Next time, I'll go for a run. Waste my energy on other things. *This boy* I know is dumb. He wants my poon + he is always all over me. I hate it. He wants to talk to thisotherkid for some reason + be like:"Is it okay if I like Elyse?" I think that is bullshit. I am no one's property + he shouldn't involve thisotherkid. Besides I don't even like this dumb boy. He always makes sexual advances towards me at school. Whatevs.  I wanted to hang out with Sarah, Matt, Jon  Another wasted Friday night.  Maybe tomorrow will be better. I leave for Bakersfield the day school gets out. I am excited. Kinda.
