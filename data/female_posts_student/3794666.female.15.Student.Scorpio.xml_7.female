Which I don't know if I believe in such a thing or not.  But that is not the topic I want to get into anymore.  I wrote in my other blog, about the world and that if I had a choice to enter it that I probably wouldn't enter it.  The fact remains that I probably still wouldn't.  It sounds like I am probably a really depressing person, and at this point in time I am really depressed.  There are so many things that are changing around here and it makes me so very sad.  One of my best friends moved in the recent months before. Janis, the best director of plays that I have ever met is moving. Which probably means that  the drama program is probably going to be fed to the dogs.  The  friends that I do have are great, but they have other friends that they hang out with all the time.  I can't believe that I am really saying all of this for the first time on this blog.  I told you some of it in my other blog, but  there is so much more that I want to let out of my heart, things that would probably make you want to take me to a shrink or something  and because other people, that i dont know and know, are probably going to read this. I will just sound like I am feeling sorry for myself, in fact I  probably already do. I think of this blog as kind of a stress releaser. I hope it will help.  I dont really know what to name this blog.  It really shouldn't have a name. It doesn't deserve one. O'well. On a different note, Our cast of little shop of horrors got together one last time to watch the dvd that they put together of our show. It was great. At the end of the showing, my dad came and I had to just leave. I was so very sad. This was to be the last time that  our cast would get together, be together. It makes   me so sad.  I would love to be on broadway when I grow up, but my mom always talks me out of it.  Well anyway thats enough. See you later
