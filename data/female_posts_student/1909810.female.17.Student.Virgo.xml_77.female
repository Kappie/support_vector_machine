I took a shower and got into some pajamas.  A very lazy but amuzing day.   Peace was cancelled though, i was a little sad about that, it seemed kind of silly, by 4:00 the roads weren't bad. Oh well, there's always tomorrow.  My friend and her boyfriend...sheesh.  They are a cute couple and all but sometimes it's like...just get over yourselves.  If I'm ever over at her house and her boyfriend calls she can spend HOURS on the phone with him while I sit in her comfy chair in her room doing nothing (I stormed out once...i think she felt bad...) but if I EVER call her while she's with him 5 seconds into the phone call she quickly says "I have to go" and hangs up.  She's blown me off because of him...and I'm just tired of them.  I'm not being the jealous type or anything...but it would be nice if she at least acknowledged my presence when she's with him...or if she wouldn't blow me off without telling me until  I  call  her .  Oh well, I guess she's just the kind of person who puts boyfriends before friends.  Anyways, fairywings.net has a new layout :D and I'm working on a site for peace...although I might decide it's dumb and not finish it.  I haven't made up my mind yet.  I need to go study...I procrastinate too often...
