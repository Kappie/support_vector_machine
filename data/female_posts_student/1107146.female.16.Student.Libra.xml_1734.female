For us poor folk, the natural social obligation, and rung in the social ladder, is to go out, get a job, get money, and work our way into the world because that's what everyone else does, or did about a thousand years ago when they were sixteen. And if you really think about it, it's nice having a car, but at the same time it's a lot of junk too, like maintaining it, foremost, then, like, when mom wants some eggs or mayo, and she chrows (as in, "throws") you inna the car and sends you packing to the store.   It's interesting how unsurprised the store people are when you come in really late and buy weird stuff, tho. That makes sense, I guess.  But that wasn't the point. Blah, I forgot what it was. Driving's lost its flair with me. My parents made me drive everywhere with my permit so as to put the fear of God into me, I can remember not driving TWICE with my mom, which is whose I drive 99 percent of the time.   But HEY, you might get the one-armed man. Abby and I have seen the one-armed man. I took my test with him, he was cool, albeit a bit silent. I think he hates two-armed people tho, and the fact that he has a very low paying job showing stupid people how they suck at driving, talking to him in languages he doesn't understand most of the time (and that's not bigotry, that's fact) probably contributes to his loathing of the human race.  I made up a really big story about the one-armed man and how he lost his arm and thus detests the race of man and plans revenge upon humanity, and it sounded really good, but: 1. I forgot it, and 2. He probably just wasn't paying attention and got it stuck in a grinder or something. Not so epic as being punished by the Mongols after he took his special time machine back to the dynasty wars to avenge his ancestors, or something to that effect.  It was cool.  I had caffeine today and it shows. I never really make lots of and/or elongated posts much anymore ("thank God!" breathed the world) since I quit burning out. What a loser I am.  I like being cool, boy howdy.
