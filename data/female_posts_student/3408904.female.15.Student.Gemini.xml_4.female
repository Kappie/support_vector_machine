It reflects right on friendships and relationships, I'm not particularly biased against my friends or what. I'm trying to show down here they theory of my quote, I felt very sorrowful ever since the split last year 2003. It has left a deep impact on my friends and my life greatly. Haa, it sounded just like boy-girl relationships, it does leave impact, aint it? Those precious times we spent together were not gonno come back again as enjoyment, instead, it's memories that we have left behind.. Time cannot reverse and put everything back to pieces again especially those precious moments that are important to us. Maybe you felt that this is totally crap but deep in my heart, I'm in dilemma to decide what to do and when to do. This has bothered me every now and then cause I'm not a very open up person, it seems like an easy job for you to make alot of friends in reality. However, to me, it' a tough job to get to know more people as I'm unrealistic...
