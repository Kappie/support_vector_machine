Hafner now has 17 homers and 75 RBIs on the season. His 11 RBIs over two games tied the Indians' franchise record set by Earl Averill in a doubleheader against the Washington Senators on Sept. 17, 1930. It also was the second time in a week that an Indian has hit three home runs in a game -- Victor Martinez did it against Seattle on Friday. Jake Westbrook got the win pitching 7 1/3 innings limiting the Angels offense.The Indians are only 4 games back of Minnesota in the American League Central Division and play a critical 2 game series against the Chicago Whitesox at the Jake beginning Wednesday Night.     .
