It feels good all over; as opposed to feeling horrid all over, which is what it felt like for the first few weeks. On monday, Herman told me something along the lines of "If you sprint all the way back (from halfway) then I'll give you a special suprise!"   I thought to myself, gee, self, you love suprises AND special things. So I ran all the way back, and today when I tried to redeem my special suprise, he told me it was the "joy of running" and that now we could start the running sooner, i.e shorten the warmup part. Wow. Thank you Herman, you fabricating crizznatch.   Speaking on the topic of general health, I've been starting to do all kinds of funshine healthy type things, not even knowingly, in the last month or so!. (sidenote: to breanna and chrystal... now that your gone, I can walk around in my underwear again. mom and dad are so used to it they don't mention even when I ask) I borrowed this tape on visualizations from Elizibeth, one of my dad's psychologist worker people, and aside from visualizing it also talks about funshine BRAIN facts. OoOOOOoOo! I want to share this joy with you now. It's a Herman joy.  This is my summary of my collective knowlage of the brain, some of it is deducted so bear with me.   Interesting Thing A   Your brain is oriented in one of three ways:   visual : most people are visual thinkers, oriented around sight.   kinesthetic : touch has the largest impact, most athletes are this way. People who like to hug alot. remember textures and such.   auditory : think in sound and thought, alot of musicians are this way.  There are more catagories, depending on what system you use. Bre told me there are seperate ones that catagorize how you learn, they are different but very simular. All they do in my opinion is expand on the 3 mentioned above, which as they are still apply to learning as well.   When I say oriented I mean its your crutch. For me, when remember things I hear them before I feel them. When I describe things to people I always go back to the way they sound. When I write fiction, ambience is the easiest and most affective sense I use when illustrating things. Of everything, music sways my emotions the most. Last night in the car, during the climax of a song I gots chills down my entire spine.  You can use more then one though. I use two very heavily when I really think about it, but I don't think anyone is naturally great at all three.  I'm also a visual. When I took a bunch of intelligence tests (legit ones, not internet ones) I scored highest in the visual-spacial areas. That makes sense. I'm always drawing infinate lines off of surfaces and seeing where they cross, noticing patterns in shapes and placement, have an odd sense for color congruency and can rotate 3 dimensional objects in my head. I'm also good at proportional type stuff and depth. I learn really well through visual too; i,e last night, with Jen. She was showing me music theory and I had to picture the fret board of a guitar. It's easy for me to make sense of WHY theory works when I use it to find patterns in the lines and dots of where the strings meet the frets. Then I had to draw it out, and the connection I was trying to make made sense.  I think I started out as a visual, but during school I had to develop my audio because during class I couldn't see the board for four years. That combined with getting into music eventaully triggered me to use my audio alot.  You use all of these, you just depend on one or sometimes two more then the other(s). When you visualize though, you need to use all of them at once, and its great for your brain. The more senses you engage at any given time the denser the wiring in your brain gets (the axons) and the more complex connections your brain creates between cells. In studies, the better problem solvers were the ones with denser wiring. They could solve more complex problems while using less energy.   Interesting Thing B   Now, you also prefer a side of your brain. Its common knowlage. (The sentence that went here was wrong.)  The left brain = linear, logical, verbal. relies on intellectualness. It's about intelligence. Reading, writing, math.  The right brain = musical, creative, non-verbal, patterns, big picture, emotional. non logical but generally accurate. It's about intuition and wisdom and the like.  I notice society labels the right side of the brain as being your "heart". However, our society is focused mainly on the left side of the brain, or the "head" (head vs heart). School really messes little kids up. Thats what I think. Every subject in school demands left brain action, so kids as they grow weak right brain functions like imagination, empathy and the most importent communiction skill of all: that of the non-verbal. I think that the reason that alot of later labelled geniuses do horrible in school is because they don't sacrifice their right brain.   Einstien's parents thought he was retarded. He later ended up succeeding because he learned to use both, first the right side then the left. His ideas were all  very big picture  ideas he later used logic to prove. It boggles me that science is so associated with the left side of the brain when the progress part happens almost exclusively through a combonation of right and left brain thinking.  The moment you decide to live entirely through your left brain your also deciding to be incorrect, esspecially in science as it's always being revised and changed.   Interesting Thing C   Visualization exercises the right part of your brain, which is a good thing. When you visualize your nervious system switches from sympathetic (ready to trigger fight or flight) to parasympathetic operation, which tends to be more creative. This is because the sympathetic lies in the beta range (of brain waves) while the parasympathetic lies just below that in the alpha range.  beta: alert - high frequency -  alpha: calm - high ampitude theta: profound, dream state, visions - high frequency and ampitude - the subconcious delta: sleep state, regeneration  Beta is where most of us are most of the time. Any time your nervious, any time your body is tense, any time you have anxiety. Meditators usually put themselves in alpha, your brain can handle more powerful thoughts, just not as quickly. Visualization occurs on a borderline alpha/theta state. Hypnosis is entirely in the theta.   When you visualize it puts your brain down into alpha. It won't happen very quickly at first, its something your brain has to exercise. In my college success class a tip that applies for almost everything is to keep yourself relaxed, in class, on tests and during homework. Thats because you recall and memorize things more easily, as well as have more complex thoughts. The opposite to that would be freezing up mentally during a presentation. Fight or flight works well in the jungle, but not in soceity. Not unless you live in New York.  Borderlining theta, which is where the subconcious lies, is where visualizing works the best. The subconcious cannot tell the difference between what you imagine and reality. This makes sense to me, because I often have childhood memories which actually were dreams I had at the time. This is why visualizing works.   Hypnotism occurs in the Theta, and it is unreliable because you have no reality filters. The hypnotist can suggest things that will become memories in whoever's hypnotized through the uber power of imagination or visualization or whatever.  In Psychology we talked about how if a person can imagine themself doing something, then they are definately capible of it. Visualization works kind of in the same way, execpt when its optimized its working around the theta level. So far for me this has only worked as a motivation technique, because I tell myself I like studying and I now I do. I don't expect anyone to be impressed by that, but the results are mostly long term. There are numerous examples on the tape I listened to, he talked alot about athletes and how they visualize making baskets or running faster, and also about guys like Nikola Tesla, and about how he invented the electric motor through visualizing over a period of 3 months, before building it. His first model surpassed prototype standards.  Visualizing is basically a way to bypass the beta/left brain limitations you place on yourself by injecting whatever you want into your sub-concious and altering things from the inside out.  Alot of people already practice this and don't even know it.  For instance, in my junior year of highschool during algebra, I'd place my head on my desk and picture this Donkey in an old style show suit doing a tap dance on all fours to some 20ies motion picture style piano. He had a top hat on too. I visualized everything from the courseness of his hair to the colors and the lights and the sound of the audience. At the end he'd flap his lip a little and go "Shibbity!" It served no real purpose besides putting me in a good mood and getting relaxed. I'm not sure if that really counts as an example.. but its still visualization, as long as you engage all your senses.   Conclusion: visualization = good   "Every authority that is not confirmed by true reason seems to be weak, whereas true reason does not need to be supported by any authority." - John Scotus Eriugena, 8th century
