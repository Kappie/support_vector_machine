Matt’s financial aid for the summer just came through, at the very last minute.  You see he had to file an appeal for financial aide suspension –he had apparently attempted more hours than he had completed, by way too many.  His appeal was approved yesterday and his financial aide just came through this afternoon at 4pm.  Today was the payment deadline for the summer I semester.  Had it not come through we would have had to come up with $248.00 to pay for his class.  Thank God for small miracles!  So now we are all paid for and while we may be flat broke, we can at the very least pay for our classes.  A huge amount of stress has just fallen away from my shoulders.  I think I have the beginnings of an ulcer and this stressing out is doing me no good, no good at all.  Still, I can’t help but stress out about things that warrant being stressed about.    Matt always frowns at me and tells me to stop the worrying that it’s only making my health worse!  DUH, but I just can’t stop worrying.  It’s truly easier said than done.  However, not that that has been taken care of it’s taken a huge load off my mind.  He’s getting to take his calculus classes for both summer I and summer II.  I would really hate to be him.  Calculus I  Calculus II but he loves math so he should do well.  I myself am taking English 1301 (Freshman comp.) and National Government.  It should be a right boring semester for me, but the upside is that they are both Internet classes.  Internet classes make me smile as they mean that I can do my class work whenever I feel like it and I don’t have to attend any classroom courses.  Internet, the way of the educational future! The only down side is that they offer very little in the way of instruction as they are self paced.  If you don’t read the books and e-mail your teachers when you have a question then you’re pretty much left in the dust.  You may pass but the chances that you’ll learn anything are slim.  Take for example the Fall 2003 semester.  I took Business Law as an Internet class –I was still a paralegal major at the time.  Business Law is a hard class; it requires a great deal of instruction combined with intense reading and understanding of the concepts.  All in all it’s a damn hard class.  I made the mistake of taking it over the Internet.  I passed with a B but I really can’t say that I learned anything.  I am hoping to take more interest in my English and Government classes this summer.  I also want to get my books today but Matt is insisting on waiting until after the first day of classes.  The problem with that is that the bookstore is hell after classes begin.  The lines are an hour or more!  He is the ultimate procrastinator and it drives me crazy.  I guess I knew he was like this before I married him but still, it tends to make my stress worse, which makes my beginning ulcer hurt like hell.    Well, now that I’ve gotten that ranting and raving out of the way I’m off.  My fingers are hurting terribly today –I think I have arthritis in my fingers and because it’s always so darn cold in the apartment, they have been hurting terribly.  I can hardly hold a pencil for more than 5 minutes, typing is not as bad, but I am still in some pain.  ~Kristyn
