Things had got really bad again, and I wasn't coping and I kept trying to tell people but they wouldn't listen. They kept telling me that I was being silly, I should just go home and be a good girl, stop making a fuss. And I was shouting at them, crying, begging them to listen but they wouldn't.  I went to the GP and they wouldn't even let me see her.  The CPN just kept saying 'now come on Karen, just stop being so silly, you are making mountains out of molehills'.  And I was like running down the street chasing after this whole group of people, but they wouldn't stop. They glanced over their shoulders, looked at me and then turned and kept walking.  I couldn't get them to stop and help me. So anyway that freaked me out a bit.  Decided to have lay-in today and watched some TV. Morning TV is crap but I felt like just blobbing.  A friend gave me some of her diary to read last night. Which was cool because it means that she trusts me. Not sure I'm ready to do the same quite yet though. We'll see.
