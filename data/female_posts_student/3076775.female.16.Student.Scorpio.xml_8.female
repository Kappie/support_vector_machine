He gave us a tour of our house. It's so pretty!!!!! *ish a wee bit jealous* eh, I'll leave. Maybe I'll kick his brother out and start living there......that probly wouldn't work out though. lol Anywho, it was reallly sweet of them to think that up, cuz I didn't know a thing about him riding home with us today. He just kinda hopped into the car. Then, after Chelsea and I went to my house, he called and said that he didn't have his notebook. So, we had to go to his house again. Not that I minded, lol. I mean, I really like him, so it doesn't bother me. ooh! we might go play tennis Thursday, me and Chelsea I mean. Maybe Nick could come too...??? *ish hopeful* hehehe... umm......................let's see, I think that's all for today. It was a really nice day.  Love, Shannon "I need your arms around me, I need to feel your touch."--Cake
