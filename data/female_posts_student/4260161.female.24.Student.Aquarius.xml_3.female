And that one was linked to another, which linked to another and so on. It's an entire community of law school blogs. So then I tried to find a blog written by a prosecutor or an assitant DA because that's what I'm interested in. I found numerous blogs by defense attorneys and public defenders. But no prosecutors. I probably didn't look hard enough - or not in the right places. So I decided to just start my own.  I'm fascinated with criminal law. Not the fictional t.v. shows like CSI but stuff like Court TV and documentaries on A&E and Discovery. The   urlLink  Innocence Project    facinates me. What sparked my interest in criminal law? Watching   urlLink  The Fugitive    with my parents and later learning it was a true story. The details are mind-boggling.  So, anyway, I decided I'd start writing about my experience in law school. I'm a rising 2L and classes start next Monday. I bought my books yesterday. Just under $700. ouch. That doesn't include supplemental materials.  Last thing: I highly recommend summer school. I think the professors are in a better frame of mind (even though I hear they get paid less for summer classes). And I think they curve higher.
