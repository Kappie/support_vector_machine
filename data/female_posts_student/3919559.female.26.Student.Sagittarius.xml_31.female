Governor Resigns, Admits Gay Affair : "At a point in every person's life, one has to look deeply into the mirror of one's soul and decide one's unique truth in the world, not as we may want to see it or hope to see it, but as it is."  - Gov. James E. McGreevey  The problem here is that McGreevey should be resigning over the corruption scandals clouding his administration, not because of an extramarital affair, regardless of whether it was gay or straight in nature.  So the whole gay thing - which should not be an issue and and the fact that it is speaks volumes about the state of American tolerance, society, etc. - clouds over the corruption.  BUt you have to give the guy credit for his frank admission and wonder how in the world he campaigned  twice  for governor and served for three years without it coming out until now, unless it was the worst kept secret in NJ.   urlLink Wonkette  has some interesting thoughts on this:  "We hope that someday it won't mean much to go on national television and announce, "I am a gay American." Someday, we hope that kind of announcement comes at the beginning of someone's political career, not the end."  "Sean Hannity, by the way, is having a little conservgasm over this.  "UPDATE: What was I saying? It's a huge conservgasm."  And so was Robert Novak on Crossfire.  Why does this guy have to be so nasty?   More:  "Calm down, my right-thinking friends. This is what I meant yesterday: McGreevey's speech was stunning, inspiring and perhaps even profound. . . It's too bad he's so corrupt.  "One of the reasons McGreevey's speech worked is that while he apologized for what he had done, he didn't apologize for being gay. He made it impossible for anyone to use his sexuality against him and the bluntness with which he did that raises the bar for every public figure who has to cop to a personal crisis on national television. We admire that.  "What would have been really great is if he'd also fessed up to ethical lapses that actually matter. We dream of a world in which McGreevey would have to resign not because he's gay, but because he's at the helm of a political machine driven by cronyism and kickbacks."  And so does the ever-enduring Rep. Barney Frank on coming out:  "I came out at 47, too, though not under threat or anything.  There was a period in my life when I was clinically depressed, on drugs, seeing a psychiatrist - I wasn't functional.  You can be a dysfunctional member of Congress, but not a dysfunctional governor.  In Congress, there are 434 other people. You can't put a governorship on autopilot."
