 It was also our one year anniversary that day. So yay for us! Well technically, we didn't have our first date until June 6th, but we "hooked up" (i.e., kissed  ALOT ) on his birthday  (alcohol was involved- hehe).  We haven't celebrated our one year yet- but we're planning to climb Mt. Pyramid to celebrate it on the week of our houseboat trip (last week of  June). More updates with pictures soon....
