I have known him since kindergarten. Then we left and went to different schools in 5th grade, and he ended up at Grace. Coincidence? I think not... His name is Blake Combs. He's 15; 6'2; blond ish brown hair' blue/green eyes; so sweet. I could go on and on about him, but i better not... I'm going to Florida on June 13 (11 days from now) and will be gone from the 13th to the 20th. Kayla is coming with me... we'll have a good time. Amber is over here. So i'm gonna go and spend some time with her. Buh~Bye
