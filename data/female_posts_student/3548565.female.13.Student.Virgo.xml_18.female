The bad news is, my practical exam is on the 5th of July (note: Shane's birthday!:D) Oh well...having another theory class tomorrow. Ah, lucky me, I passed up my book to the teacher last week, so there's no extra work to finish off today. :)  But I DO hope that my answers are correct lol.  Anyways, I've done my sticker thingy last night. Strained my fingers lol. Trust me, it's no piece of cake! :P  Ah..will be off to pick Rach and Connie soon. I better go practice my exam pieces now. Byezzzzz!! :) --Fluffles--
