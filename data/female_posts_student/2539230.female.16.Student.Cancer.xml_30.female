Now women and whiskey, they ain't the answer Lord, well I just know that this here is true  But the way that I'm feeling, I just might be thinking Lord, tonight they just might have to do  I've spent a lot of long and lonely nights in honkey tonk taverns  I was two fisted drinking and fighting back against the wall  And I know it's a problem, a no win situation,  but I can't seem to resist that old whiskey call  Mister pour me a drink Hell, give me the bottle Set me down in the corner 'till we're two sheets gone And don't tell me no stories, about a good hearted woman I wanna hear "Your Cheatin' Heart" and cry all night long  Now me and my buddies We've got a lot in common We all wish we could take time and just turn it around  Take us back to the good old days of hard work and cowboy ways Take us to a swingin' door saloon  This is what we'll say  Hey Mister pour us a drink Hell, give us the bottle Set us down in the corner 'till we're two sheets gone And don't tell me no stories, about a good hearted woman I wanna hear "Your Cheatin' Heart" and cry all night long  Yeah, pour us a drink Hell, give us the bottle Set us down in the corner 'till we're two sheets gone And don't tell us no stories, about a goodhearted woman I wanna hear "Your Cheatin' Heart" and cry all night long
