I hoped you would come, to help me out, but I found you never really cared." 8-20-03 I hate people who make assumptions about me. Not even half of the people I hang out with really know me. They know the shaded side of me. The front that I put up. If I really acted the way I am at home, I would probably sit in the back of the class, in the corner, thinking of so much, that it means nothing at all. People see the happy side of me, and they think im depressed, I would hate to see their reaction now. (and to everyone who has read this, or is reading it now, im not a mental case. dont even think about it..) I can't help it though, I try to talk to people. They all just seem to depend on me to hear there problems, and deal with the problems for them, but if I would try to talk to someone, they would just blow me off and start on some completly random subject.  I think the problem, isn't so much a 'me' thing. Everybody else is just way to self centered, to give a damn about how I feel. And if I would be sad, or angry, it's not like I could tell anyone, because I can tell that most of it, is just out of pity. I wont stoop down to that level.  On the brighter side of the rainbow.. Tonight is our first preformance, woo..(in sarcastic voice...) I really dont want to go. I just want to sleep. I mean, we march pretty good, and sound pretty good..It's just that, this means I have to see everybody,  and cover my front up again. And I am not in the mood for that. I rather slip into my emo mood and sit in the dark, while playing some music, and think more about  why I am like I am. But thats just me. I might go and try out for 'Romeo and Juliet.' KSU is doing a production, and they need a 14 yr. old. right up my ally. Plus I already have more than half memorized, so it wouldnt be too hard.  I dread the day that school starts. UGH! I'll probably end up spazing out on someone, or freaking out, and that's never too pretty. I hope I dont. But hey, im unpredictable.  After dad leaves, I think im going to go and rest. I need some sleep. I need to think and relax. This day sucks. I'll write tonight when I get home. Someone save me.
