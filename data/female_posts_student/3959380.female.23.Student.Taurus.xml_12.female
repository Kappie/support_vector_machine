He reckoned that SUGAs could have taken Silver or Gold, which is reasonable, but he also thought that they were the only team that put their girls to use.  That's such bullshit.  Not only have I never played so hard and well, but I have never had so much of the disc and so many compliments from the team.  And it wasn't just me, it was Liz and Loz as well.  Apart from the fact that we had to play savage after Suse did her ankle at the beginning of the first match against SUGAs, so we did stand in the stack a little to conserve energy, they absolutely  did not  dominate us other chicks like Will claims.  Some of the best (and sometimes easiest) D I played was against SUGAs.  I absolutely agree that Monash and BUF weren't making much use of their girls, but no girls were tougher than Loz and Liz who both played through some injuries.  I'm probably just biased, but I reckon that Will, like Andy, wasn't really watching the games so hard.  John asked TD Bart last night who he thought were the stand out tournament virgins on our team, and I was mentioned.  So I'm not shit.... but I'm still biased :p
