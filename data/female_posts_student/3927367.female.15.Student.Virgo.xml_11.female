Then we went home, and i just sat around for the next 2 hours, trying not to distract him from packing, which he still had not done. I played with his dogs, talked to his mom, and just hung out. Then we had a steak dinner and his friends (shay, seth, and jeremy) showed up. They certainly made things interesting. After dinner we all went into the study and watched strongbad emails from  urlLink homestarrunner.com  and from  urlLink joecartoon.com . The gerbil cartoons are the best. I would suggest joe fish. That one is hilarious. After all that the guys went to carls junior to get more food. Damn bottomless pits. They left Tyler and I alone. We just sat in his room and talked about everything and nothing. I had done so well the whole day, and then mrs.goodnight came in and said that matt would be taking me home at 9:30, which was an hour away. She left and I just totally broke down. It was completely ridiculous and retarded of me. I have known ever since last October when we first started going out that he would eventually leave for college. I know a part of me knew this, but i think another part of me didn't want to believe it. I believe it now. His mom and him ended up taking me home that night. I watched him drive away, then i went to the kitchen and sat in darkness for a half hour. I then went to my bedroom, sat on my bed, and cried. I know i fell asleep sometime after midnight, but i'm not sure when. This is only the third time that i can ever remember crying myself to sleep. Sunday morning came. I got up to do the paper route. My mom was ticked at me because i hadn't gone downstairs saturday when i got home to tell them that i was home. She said that she didn't even know that i had gotten home. "Well, that's your fault now isn't it." is what i was thinking. While waiting to go to church i was sitting downstairs. My dad asked my i was so melancholy. "You use to always be my little ray of sunshine!" he said. "Yeah, when i was what, three?!" was my reply. As these little excerpts of my day may show, i was in a very depressed and angry mood. Sunday was a black day. I did get to talk to tyler though. At nine i called him, but it just kept ringing, so i hung up. a minute after i hung up the phone rang and it was tyler. He's doing good. Having a fun time. Hanging out with dalari and whitney. I love whitney to death. She's so funny. I really dislike dalari though, for retarded reasons of my own that only one other person knows about. Unfortunately, i can't help but thinking that once his school really starts, and he gets busy, i'll either be mostly forgotten, or completely forgotten. Whatever happens happens i guess. All i know is that he is gone, but such is life. And time moves on.
