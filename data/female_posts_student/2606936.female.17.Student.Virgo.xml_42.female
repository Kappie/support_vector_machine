But i just realized if you go into the thingy, it shows you where peopel got referrals, and how they found me on search engines and stuff.  It was kinda freaky bc last night, one of the addresses was a Google search, with a query about "pictures of naked little boys doing" something I don't especially want to type on the internet. Sure, I'm a publicity whore, but i don't want THAT kind of publicity. (please don't lead them back to my page now.)  However, my Simpsons love has helped a bunch, since the biggest searches were stuff like "puppy," "goo," and "milhouse."  OH NO. I just realized i no longer have the link to REJECTED. Ahhhhhhhhh.  Homework? Psh. Pssssssssssssssssssh. High school kids don't do WORK on the weekends, especially a 4-day weekend! Especially when we feel like losers and stuff like that. No, we blog and im each other and ingest caffeine.  I think I'll go mess with my new bangses. Have a charmed evening.
