I feel I have gotten way closer to God...I now see things in a different light, I find the reason behind things, and that I'm thankful for. I realize why some things may happen and some things may not, but I'm okay with whatever reason I find, and that I'm thankful for.  Thank You God for helping me through this summer. Thank You God for my family. Thank You God for You. Thank You God for all You've taught me this summer. Thank You God. Thank You God. Thank You God!
