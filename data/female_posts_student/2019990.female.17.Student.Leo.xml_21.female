I do have one going away "reception" for one of the foreign exchange students on Teusday, but other than that I think I'm done.  What a relief, and now I know how to do it for next year.  I wonder if I'll have as many next year.  Sadly probably not, even though I will be a senior.  Lol, how ironic.  Oh well, they don't like me, and I don't like them.  It all works out.     Tomorrow I have to go to Great Spoons, and find dressy clothes for my trip to Pittsburg.  I am job shadowing my aunt, and I have to be dressy while I'm at her office.  that's 10 days, and I certainly don't have 10 days worth of dressy clothes.  I have maybe 4.  So Wonder Woman helped me put some stuff together tonight.  So far we have 6 outfits, but that's four short.  Hopefully my mom is understanding with her checkbooks tomorrow, or I'm going to struggle.     Tomorrow should be a good day though, I don't have to go in to yearbook since it's a holiday, so I have time to go to GS, and then relax later.  That's all for now.     I'm sorry this post is written so poorly, but I'm really spacy today.  I too two really hard naps.  It was tough to wake up.
