We went to Oban on Saturday and had a look round and on Sat night we went to a pub in the middle of nowhere and got pissed, eventhough the pub was miles from civiliazation i still managed to meet a couple of people knew!!  Sunday got up late and chilled most of the day. Did manage to do a little study but i couldnt be bothered.  Iv been studying this morning at work tho but dont think it will help much, im looking forward to having a few days off after my exam and not have to think about anything like work or results or exams.  May not be any posts for a while as going away, so there will be not computer access. bye for now and behave!!
