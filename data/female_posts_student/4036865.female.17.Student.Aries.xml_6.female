Poetry seems like a good topic, i have some of my own, perhaps i will share it in time. i've been thinking about how superficial people are, how shallow our society has sunk, its sad. i would rather not think about it, but its something that is there, that is all around You. people shunned because of what they look like, what they wear, what they act like , ever who they are friends with.  Cliche. For all of those people who are feeling down...Carpe Diem (or is that ei? either or, You know what i mean) In summary, this has been a pretty good day, yes, pretty good. i ate too much at lunch, felt rather ill, but instead of complaining, i should be happy that i actually have enough food that i can eat so much i feel like im gonna explode...which at the moment, was a thought that i embraced. i wore heels today, for what? so i can be 3 inches taller? no...not that, i like being short, i just like the way they look, and they are actually excellent on the legs, and posture to a certain extent. However, now i have a blister on the bottom of my foot, makes me want to cry. i had a good cry a few days ago, it wasnt out of pain, or anxiety, or fear, or happiness...i just cried. a cleansing. Does anyone notice how wonderful it smells after a good rain, how that rainbow peeks out, how the birds greet the sun? That how it felt, i felt way better, clean again, it washes away all my hatred and anger and sadness, and leaves me with a clean slate.  Thats it for today.
