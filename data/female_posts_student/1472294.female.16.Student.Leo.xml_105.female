He sounded ssssooo confident that all of us were able to go to JC -__- I am unsure if I should go to JC....  Anyway, on a happier tone, today our school gave out lots of prizes. That included 'B' Boys Basketball players and 'B' Girls Volleyball players. Both won and created such a commotion that they gave glory to god bfore and after the match. That's why they won....  The science and maths competition.... -_____- I sat until my legs were numb and 'sleeping soundly' (>_
