Firstly you have to know the language of the geek, it's kinda like ebonics...only for not ghetto people. It's called 1337 or 'leet' short for elite. It was mainly used by hackers in the late 1990s, now it's mainly a joke. A good place that will translate 1337 is: urlLink h4x0r . I'll finish this post later... have to catch some zzz.
