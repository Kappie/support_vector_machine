So, yesterday, took the SAT.. for not studying and talking on the phone till 11 at night... i feel pretty good about it.  It rained yesterday, oh i like rain, it's not snow, and anything that isn't snow is okay in my book.    The test was at Washington so i stopped by Jamie's to talk a bit.  I really miss talking to Jamie, i wish she and I could hang out more often, but with JO volleyball and homework and whatnot... the schedules just don't mesh.  Youth Rally is going to kick butt though.  A whole weekend w/ Chad, Kayli, Jamie, Aris, and Hillary too!  and...... I GET TO SING.  I really love singing in the praise band.  just 4 days till Rally, oohh it couldn't come soon enough  Yesterday I just hung out all afternoon, Chad dropped off a CD of the Great Gatsby and i then i fell asleep around 11.    This morning I sang in church, played bells, and then had a pancake feed.  It was a lot, and we made a bunch of $$$... and I mean a BUNCH.  I read the Great Gatsby all afternoon and just relaxed!!! for once in the longest time.  I went to Cell group... which was really boring today.  Chris actually had a lesson plan... see we don't do planning... give us a topic and we'll discus it to death... just don't try and come in w/ a plan... we'll kill it i guarantee it.  Went to bells... got yelled at... a WHOLE lot by Pat.  Apparently Chad and Kayli and I talk a lot???  or something like that... i don't know i was talking to chad i didn't listen.  Then i took Geoff home, no...stopped by Subway first and he bought subs... then i took him home and we talked a while.  I've decided i don't want Geoff to "fix" anything.  I say, just let it be, I've had too much bad experience and wasted too much time trying to change someone's opinion of me.    But I am procrastinating horribly, i need to finish my reading for the Great Gatsby.   ~Dibble
