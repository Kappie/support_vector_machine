I finally had some time to watch FLCL and so I got this idea to take this quiz again... and suprise   You are Haruko! You love to hit people (mostly with a guitar) and are somewhat insane. You get those mood swings, one minute you'll be angry and the next you're bouncing off the walls. You ran over Naota with a vespa and now you're curious as to the things comming out of his head.   urlLink   flcl character quiz     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I love VESPA's so much!  My sister also got the invader zim dvd.  So much fun SO MUCH.   You are GIR. You are... completely insane... and, quite possibly, the most lovable creature in the universe. Whether you're screaming and running into things, making soap with bacon, watching mindless television programs, or devouring everything in sight, there's no question about it--you are filthy with cuteness... like a baby... except... metal.    urlLink   The Greatest, Most Advanced Invader Zim Character Profiling Quiz EVER!!!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   so .. i took another quiz...  I need a new keyboard, the c's dont work no more and random other keys go out.  Yup, way to much food spilling on ths baby... And on that note my ear is horribly infected!!! Great time for my insurance to change. Ah, my sister is growing up, and she now has a xanga, yup I remember those days.  She's thirteen and anything I did she can't do until five years after the age I had done it at.  So... at 13 that would put her at, oh my god she's cloned erin.  But i really do love all my sisters.  in little ways they remind me of myself.  me and all my sisters went though the insane stage of being very little and talking outloud to invisble things and singing... well i think we never grow out of that. shit did i say that? and well M is going through the stage where she curses a whole lot, and so if she's anything like me she will grow out of that at about... whenever she has children. I am glad to be home and I am able to devote more time to art, gardening, wicca and everything else I have been ignoring, mostly myself I think.  So I love you all... I think, and if we haven't talked in a while drop me a line, i really miss you...
