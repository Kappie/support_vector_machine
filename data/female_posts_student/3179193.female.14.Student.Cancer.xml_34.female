Well, good news. I messed around on my guitar yesterday and wrote a song. Yeah... iunno... it's crap so yeah.   I went out today to try on my grad dress. Still need some minor alterations. That was around 6pm. Then I came back and went to Rachel's house with Jae. Haha...! Jae was on her computer going through her files while I just sat on the bed talking non-stop. Then, Jae got tired of going through her files and got off. I went on the computer but sadly, her internet didn't work so I couldn't blog. Dammit. Then, Jae wanted to get back on the computer to play on the tennis game on her VBA. Haha! He and I fought for Rach's chair. Big meanie Jae! >O
