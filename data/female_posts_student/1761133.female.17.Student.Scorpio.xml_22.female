Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing ring ting tingle-ing too Come on, it's lovely weather For a sleigh ride together with you  Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "you hoo" come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go let's look at the snow we're riding in a wonderland of snow Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand just holding your hand  we're gliding along with the song of a wintery fairy land  our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we We're snuggled up like 2 birds of a feather would be  Let's take the road befor us and sing a chorus or two come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
