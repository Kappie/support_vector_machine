Man of my dreams my ass. That is the biggest asshole I've almost ever met. I called him one night and he was at 'his party' and I was like 'OH thanks for inviting me'. and I was joking and he got all serious and was like, well how r u gonna get out here. Is your mom gonna drive you out here and pick you up... did u expect me to pick u up. Then I just hung up cuz i wasnt gonna be made fun and sit there and take it. So his friend calls me back and is like we have plenty of beer if your mom's gonna drive you out u can come. Like no asshole I was just kidding.... and after about 15 mins. of argueing i just said fuck it... then i brought up the fact that he called me a psycho bitch and told carm all i did was complain. when i asked about this he got all frustrated. and he was like babe i was just kidding I wouldnt call u if i thought u were a psycho bitch. So we argued and I was like oh whatever im going, and he was like tonight is not a good night to talk.. I'll just call you tom. .. Guess what... he never fucking called... fucking pussy!!! Ya so now I'm calling him... WOW..... Carms talking this could be potentianlly bad... ( I'm a lil tipsy so im having a hard time spelling)... this is going great... anyway!!!  Ya so now that I'm done talking to him, I guess we're straight.  i dunno whatever.  I went on a 'date' w/ paul wed. It was good i guess. We went to a movie and saw harold and kumar go to white castle.   it was funny.  He's a nice guy... and cute... i dunno were this is going but it could go somewhere.... ok i forgot what I was typing ill just ttyl... peace!
