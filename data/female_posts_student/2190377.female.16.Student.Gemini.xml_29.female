I DO remember me and Vidya being psychotic children babbling in fake swedish about swedish fish and practicing our retarded scooby doo laugh before mondays game... haaaaaaaah.  what a weird week.  OOH GOOD STORY  So I run into Octavian and Annie in the hall after Chem or something right?  And she waves and says "Hi Ashleigh!!!" and  THEN she waves to the passing Mr. Majeskie, who promptly gives her a really sour look. I start laughing hysterically.  Annie doesn't understand why.   You see, on her hand in huge bold letters is written, "FUCK" Her other hand says "me." Apparently, it was Octavian's doing, but the fact that she didn't remember it and was unknowingly cussing out everyone she waved to that day makes me smile :) ok bad story.  it was so funny. you had to be there  evilkennyoo 7: aw man... most embarrassing moment of my life today evilkennyoo 7: at least between me and my mom spaceypiXiechick: uh oh spaceypiXiechick: how so evilkennyoo 7: i was eatin one of those yo crunch dealys (white yogurt) at the computer and i accidentally got some around the keyboard and i didnt realize it then my mom went down and was like "kenny... i think you should clean up after yourself" evilkennyoo 7: i thot i was gonna die   ALSO! Jose made my day.  That rhymed. :)  He gave me a mountain dew.  Now I am happy.  oh also  I give Rachel a ride home right? and she says to me as she leaves, "Ashleigh you know how much I like you?" me,"how much?"  "a whole poptart much!" and leaves a strawberry poptart on my dashboard. haaaaaah   -_-  I am obsessed with poptarts.  and carrots.  and trailmix. omg i could live on them forever.    do you like how i alternate between big words and unintelligible internet lingo?  especially when i randomly decide to capitalize/punctuate sentences  I have many many Jose quotes, but John Jarvis wrote em all down for me during HUM.  Don't worry, I'll get them  ASAP!!!!!
