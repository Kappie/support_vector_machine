       
      The eye drifts Down the leg, The perfectly fitted, starched leg of faded blue jean, To the pointy clad foot Sticking out from under the hem. The hard heels Pound their surly Manhattan beat, Ankles holdind their own, Wobbling, threatening to keel over, Straining to avoid a strain.  These women and their shoes, I hate them so much.
