I'm still not done...sigh.  Renee came down Friday night and we hung out with some people from work.  During a game of Mafia, Bruce and I proved once again that we are too smart for ACSO.  But alas, we're stuck here for the time being.  I was supposed to be seeing Thomas this weekend, or so I thought, but the lines of communication broke down somewhere along the way, and he ended up only being in Florida for 24 hours, during which he was celebrating his Mom's birthday.  He may be moving back to Florida sometime soon, which is exciting stuff.  I've missed having my best buddy in the same city, and 3 states away has been rough.  Tomorrow the new interns start, so it's gonna be a long week. Hopefully working out will happen sometime this week as well.  Sigh.
