I told him that he needs to close his doors, since he is constantly sitting in his room, through the thin walls and blasting his "I'm the Original Gangster music", while the rest of us actually have stuff to do, plus it echoes to our end of the hall. Its the music that never ends. He was apparently under the misconception that he had title to decibel rights. Not so. And I told him that the exact reason i dumped him in feb still obviously existed. He doesn't think about how he affects others. Plus his little solo last night while we were all talking....he sang Regulators....in his booming voice, above the roar of the crowd so (once again) all had to listen to him. He sang the whole song. I was like Okay, come on, everyone's trying to talk I can't hear the other side of the table. His answer, "I don't give a *%$#, you shut-up." No thanks jerko. I can't believe he went to Rice. He crashed my friends little pow-wow and then had to act like an ass. I think I will just become a nun and never date again.
