I'm still halfway through TLCing a column I did yesterday on a big scale anion addition, that looks like it wasn't so selective because I think there is some bis addition product (although maybe not any mono addition to the wrong lactone).  I didn't finish it yesterday because it was international/mid-year orientation and I was manning the frisbee and dancesport tables.  We got a few people interested in ultimate from the UK, USA and Canada.  Hopefully a couple of them a girls who have played before who we can get to come to AUG.  Spent most of this morning running around between computers, trying to transfer and delete old spectra from the Unity300 because TK said it was nearly full.  Got rid of a load of Cuzzupe's files, but there are still a few files from Lucy, Ferdows and Yi Ming that are a little redundant.  Also wrote some instructions for those morons in my group who can't handle Unix.
