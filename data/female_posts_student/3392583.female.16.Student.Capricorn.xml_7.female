That would suck ass.  i'd have to spend my senior year taking those fucking classes all over again instead of doing what I wanted to do.  Two more days... I'm dying.  I need to get out before I kill myself.  a number of my better friends graduated this weekend.  i'm already feeling more exposed.  It feels great, except not.  This guy I dated for a while was at several of the same parties as me... he's a thespian too.  I tried talking to him and it was all cool, because I stil kinda like him, i guess.  But I put him through too much shit for him to be able to forgive me, and so the best I can do is act like I'm not really, really pissed at myself right now.  So I'm moving on.  But it's hard when he's there, laughing (in a nice way) at my lack of ability at fooseball, or watching my other classmates playing video games while I run my hands through his hair (hey! my friend was playing with my other ex's hair!... god, that sounds wierd.  but hey, It's a dysfunctional group)...  I should probably control myself better.  He's not even cute, really.  nice, yes.  Smart, very.  he's so goddamn smart, i feel like I'm nothing just talking to him.  But he can make me feel like I'm better than him when he wants to.  That was nice, when he did it.  Now I can only kinda touch him.  things get wierd when I'm behind him, running my hands through his hair like I'm fascinated by how curly it is, all the while hoping that he'll tell me to either back off, or that he gives a shit about me.  Because he's said nothing either way.  he won't tell me he's pissed, he won't tell me he's ok.  And yet so many times in the school hallway, he tries to go in the opposite direction of me, whether or not there's ten more yards to go before we actually pass each other.  Why the fuck won't he ust tell me to fuck off?  Because, man, i need a reality check.  i'm going crazy.  I really llike him.  and of course, being the fucker that I am, I screwed things up.  figures.  Meh.  I just gotta worry about school right now.  Forget him.  he's just a guy.  I'm too young to worry about guys right now.  Grades.  Geeze, if I get an f...  Ok, then.  too much self pity in this entry.  Whoever reads this is gonna love that...  but who reads this piece of crap blog anyway?
