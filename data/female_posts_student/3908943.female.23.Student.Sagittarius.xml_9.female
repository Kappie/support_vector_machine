You never know what you're going to see while you drive.  And even when I'm bored I can find things to easily amuse myself.  One thing was to see how many different state license plates I could find along our route.  38 states represented along the route from Decatur to Texarkana...  Another thing I do sing obnoxiously loud to cds and stuff.  See even 12 hour drives can be fun!     I've got stuff to do in the next couple of days.  Tomorrow is laundry and errand day (again).  Friday I leave for Joliet to see Augy before he leaves for Boston.  We're going to his friends bar that night to spend time with his friends and his cousin (I'm guessing).  I head back Saturday, and hopefully Sunday I'll be meeting my old high school friend Sharon for lunch.  It's been a long time since we've spent any time together, not since the days of high school.  That seems like a lifetime ago now.  It'll be fun to catch up!  :-)
