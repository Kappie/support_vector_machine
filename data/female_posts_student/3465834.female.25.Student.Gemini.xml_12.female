I am not preaching in least, if anything I am playing the pot calling the kettle black as I too am plauged by the social need to look like Brittney Spears or Jennifer Aniston. Is it really possible to have a world of 5'10's  120 pounders? If every person weighed about the same and looked about the same without their clothes off, who then would we aspire to look like? Would then the ideal image change from Britney Murphy clones to maybe Rosanne Barr, or maybe a little less dramatic like any one of the Dixie Chicks? I'm not going to make this political and go into the disasterous world of eating disorders etc., but I was just wondering what the world would be like if we all had killer abs and flat tummies...? I wonder if when one of the killer ab'd folk dies and a loved one is reading their eulogy, do they say something like, "what a wonderful, kind person, always so giving etc etc (cuz you can't say bad things about the dead - even if its true) and man what killer abs". I mean at age 60 - 100 what will the ab's have turned into? Ever watch those infomercials like 6 second abs, or ab-meister and the like, there's always that token 60+ year old to intice even the senior's market into buying the equipment, it's gross. And can we talk about what having a grandma with better ab's then me would do to my self image? Aren't most women on average a size 10 anyway? Why on earth would my grandmother want "great abs"? I mean not to say that just because she's a grandma she shouldn't look good, but eeeww a six pack on a 60 year old, what would you do with all the skin? Ha, ok now I'm just being ignorant, and I probably lost my point somewhere a couple sentences ago, so I'll shy away from senior's weight lifting. If I didn't lose my point or fail to make an argument so far I'm about to, because I'm gonna go for a run and do some sit up's so I too can look like Brittney Spears and Jennifer Aniston!!! If there was a way to roll my eyes on this blog, I'd be doing it right now. K p.s. I wonder if having a great body would make me a better person? I wonder if I had killer abs would I have to forfit something I already have like a charming personality in order to have both? Can you have the best of both worlds? Can you have killer abs and be a killer person? Probably, and I envy you. I however have never had killer abs so I wouldn't know (well except when I was 15 but no one knew cuz well, I was 15 and having killer abs wasn't in 10 years ago for a 15 year old) I mostly wore big t-shirts and was awkward about my skinny, muscular skiing body. Ahh the good 'ol days!!! Ha ha ahhahahahhaaaa!!! p.p.s. Why are the most finely fit and tuned athletes in the world, the 5 most top athletes and most of the people going to the olympics not all 6-packed out? I noticed recently that they are more just flat stomached, they don't really have a 6-pack, and they are the most fit ppl in the world? Hmm makes you think? Abs or fit?
