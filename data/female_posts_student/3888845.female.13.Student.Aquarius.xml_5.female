I don't want to be the one to ruin it for you!) My favorite bit was at the end when donkey and dragon had little baby's! They were little Donkeys with wings, and instead of a mane they had little spikes! (They were so cute!)      Ha! Ha! Ha! My Goldfish are staring at me! There in a big tank and there staring at me! I just hope my dad feed them this morning! There is a black and white fish which is mine called Panda, 2 Calico fan fish (hope I spelt it right), called Tasuki and Amiboshi, and 5 small glow in the dark fish called Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Wood!      Shhhh...My little Dashund is crying because my dad has just gone out to the shop for some random reason!! Wow I get to go to the Sealife Center today, to see the new Jellyfish, yeah.....That's not very exiting is it?      I'm watching the 'Black Night' Its a really cool film! At the moment the night is giving the medieval person some trainers?? (what's that about?)    Any way see you later,           Bye x x x
