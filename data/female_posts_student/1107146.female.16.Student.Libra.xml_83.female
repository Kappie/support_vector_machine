There's something in one of you that's trying to say "it's over but it's still ok to act like we were when it was going on". Perhaps inadvertently; however it is superfluous trying to explain this reasoning to your ultimately ineffible logic.  Gunter will still be an asshole, why, because he judged me groundlessly, whereas I had every right to, considering I had all the instances to do as such.   Your insistantce in trying to make me see this eye to eye is worthless.  So is it with me.  So drop it.
