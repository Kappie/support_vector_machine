Its ahrd to explain and I don't feel like telling everyone....Anywho...I woke up at 2 and I thought it was like 6:30 so I was like yippee woohoo. I will go open my stocking, so I did. I got a sue-wheat wallet...and something else important that I forgot. :) But I then I was like wow..I am tired. So I went upstairs and I found out it was 2 so I went back to bed...but I didn't really sleep. Finally the clock struck 7:47 so I went downstairs and we started to open gifts. My two brothers got Ipods...Again. Matt already has one but he wanted a better one. Hah..okkayy..    Thenn..Hannah got 50 billion things, like always. Its funny how that works out. You would think the oldest would be spoiled but no...but I am not angry. :)  My present was pretty spiftacular.  First, I got  a bunch of Stilla makeup  from Hannah, a CD from Jacob, and a Branches gift card from Matt. From my mom I got a book on how to take good digital pictures. Then I got a memory card.  (my mom thought I didn't know what I was getting Hah...sillly mom)  And..I got a shirt and a watch. I don't think I got anything else...maybe I did *shrugs*  Well, duh i did.   But I am going to tel you NOW!   Its a gorgeous...  Fujifilm Fine Piz S5000  In case you can't tell, its  a digital camera.    A prettttty  digital camera.  You can record video with it! Its pretty sue-wheat!  Yup, now my relatives are coming over.
