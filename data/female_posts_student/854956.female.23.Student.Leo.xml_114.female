Monday was the worst day, but we expected that.  We only have 3 vet ASK staff... all the rest of us are new... and on Monday we were short staffed because one of our gals had foot surgery on Saturday (because of some accident).  So, we don't know when she'll be back to work.  :-(  In the meantime, this makes things hard for us!!!  Our groups are all capped for ratio... even Greg has to jump into ratio, and he's not even supposed to.  However, I've been lucky with the kids in my group.  All but one are absolute delights.  They're all very helpful, and we had fun yesterday, and look forward to it today!!!  Hopefully we can actually follow our lesson plan for today, but that all depends on whether or not we can get our groups together more quickly and through bathroom breaks more quickly so we have more outside time.  Anyhow... tonight we're all going out to eat for Ricky's birthday.  I don't know where we're going... but somewhere we shall go.  :-)  So, that is what I'm doing after work... I'm probably just going to bring a change of clothes along with me and change at Ricky's before we leave for dinner.... otherwise it'll take me forever and a day to change at home and make my way over there eventually.  OH YEAH... and we're getting new windows.  Today is the second day that the workers have been here, and it should be done today.  SHOULD be....  They look nice... much different than the piece of crap windows that were in there before.  Hopefully it'll help out our AC/Heating bills.  :-)  Anyhow... off I go... I need to start getting ready for work, and then eventually leave here to work my ass off today...
