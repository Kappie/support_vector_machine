I can't wait to get out and figure out what it is that I am going to do for a living. This blog is a perfect way for me to get some sanity from all the craziness going on in my life and vent somethings via frustrations and be excited about other things via elations. I hope you can at least get a kick out of some of the wacky things that happen to me almost daily.    Frustrations- I am taking six courses this summer in order to graduate. Now that sounds bad enough right? Wrong..this past week my computer crashed. I lost almost everything because I hadn't backed anything up. I'm borrowing my dad's laptop at pres moment. Now after that happened on Tuesday night I cracked my front tooth in three places and ended up at the ER in Plymouth. This resulted in me having to have a root canal yesterday $800..ugh! and going to have a crown put on today. Geez..I guess when it rains it really does pour. But thats enough complaining for now. I have had some good things happen too.  Elations-I got a motorcycle last week. Its a cute little red Honda Rebel. I was prompted to buy it after going with my boyfriend, Jon, to Laconia Bike Week in New Hampshire. I've been practicing riding and am going to a motorcycle safety course next week where I will hopefully earn my license. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I'm also getting ready to go to Florida next month and am getting excited about a fifteen day cruise that I am taking with my mom in the Mediterranean.  Well thats all the time I have for now. I have to run to my lovely dentist appointment. Take Care~Until later...
