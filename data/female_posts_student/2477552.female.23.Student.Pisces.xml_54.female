The school is hiring for placement in the fall for the writing center. I want this soo bad. It would be an awesome thing for my resume and awesome experience for teaching editing.  I made the appointment at the same time as two guys, so hopefully they'll be wooed by my  charming feminine wiles.  eh? lol.   So send me all of your positive thoughts at eleven...I really want them to say they love me and that I'm a great writer. lol. I mean, c'mon being compared to some guys...I should win hands down! :)
