So I've basically felt like sleeping for the entire day since that point. We're trying to set up a new web portal here... I'll let you know when it's up. Our newest site design idea is for a website where you can meet new people to communicate with on AIM/ICQ/Y!/MSN. Anyways, I'm probably about to fall over in my chair by this point, so I'll call it quits.     Last song I listened to:   Enemy  by Eve 6.    Last album I listened to:   Copland - Appalachian Spring .    Last meal I ate:  Spaghetti with garlic marinara sauce. It was really good!    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Why, listening to more drum cadences, of course!   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I do not know.   Last person I talked to:  Steph.    Favorite song today:  The Cavaliers' drum cadence.    Favorite food today:  Spaghetti :).    Most interesting thing I did today:  I played tennis for 3 and a half hours. I think that sets a new record for me :P.    Funniest thing that happened today:  David struggling with the MySQL server :D.
