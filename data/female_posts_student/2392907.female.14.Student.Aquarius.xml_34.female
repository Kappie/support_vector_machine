I've found me a band.. Well nearly. We've got 4 members so far." "What are you called?" "Kara's Flowers." Janey gives Adam an amused look. "What? It's cos of a girl called Kara." Janey emits a small laugh. Silence as Adam sits there nodding to himself while sipping his latte for some reason. "What have you been up to?" "Me? Not much really. Well.. I'm alright. Yeh." Nods. "I set up my own company... I have Yao and Ben working for me now. Hahaha.. Well Yao is my deputy and Ben.. You know, I don't actually know what Ben does. I think he's a toilet cleaner or something. Hmm.." "Oh. There's a Yao now, is there?" Adam says, clearly jealous and curious and annoyed. "He's just a deputy. It's a growing company. Yeh. It's called Google." she says proudly. "What's that?" "Do you have the internet?" "No." "OK then. Don't worry about it." Long awkward silence while Adam wonders what the hell Google is and whether Yao will be a threat. Jane thinks about Adam's hair. "You know.. I have to go now Adam. It was nice meeting you again." Jane starts getting up. "Um, can I have your number? Maybe I'll call you some time." Pause. "Er, sure." Jane scribbles her number down, secretly thinking abuot how she must NOT wait beside the phone as soon as she got back from her meeting. "Ok, bye then." "Bye."
