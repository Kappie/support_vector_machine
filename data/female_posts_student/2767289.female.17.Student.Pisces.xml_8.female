Yes, sure, it would be quite nice to have a million bucks lying around, and being financially secure and what-not…  It just pisses me off, though; how some people are telling me “you should invest.  You should buy mutual bonds.  You shouldn’t be an employee; you should buy your own company and be the boss. Yada yada yada…”  You know what??  First  you  do that!   You  try buying and running your own damn company when you have never even worked in your life and have no experience in the real world.   Once  you become a fuckin millionaire,  then  will I only listen to your small-minded advice!!  Personally, I would feel a lot better about my self, of who I am, if I were to serve the community somehow and get paid for service.  I don’t even think I would need millions in my life.  I just can’t seem to see myself doing stocks or whatever…trying to be rich.  I wouldn’t be able to go through everyday having to check if I should sell or buy or fire or hire a new broker…. I think with all that stress, I’ll die too early and wouldn’t even have a chance to see my riches.  LoL.   Sadly to say, people are never happy with they have.  They always seem to desire for something better, something more superior.  So if they were to have that million, will they be happy with that??  My guess is no.  I mean, if you can’t be happy with what you have now… how can you expect to be satisfied with something more??  Wanting is an addiction. Now I’m not trying to say that doing stocks, investing, etc, is considered greed and its evil…ooo… no!  Not at all!  It’s just that I’ve been noticing that lately that’s the only thing on people’s minds!  They don’t seem to see and enjoy the simple pleasures of life.  Nothing has significance to them!  They’re like robots!  Work/School, sleep, eat, repeat, etc.  It feels like we’re losing culture.  We’re losing those special moments that appear before us, but we just don’t realize it cause we are too caught up in our oh-so busy lifestyle…  Pity.  Life has soooo much to offer than that...
