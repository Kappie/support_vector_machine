So mom and dad start talking about how im a witch and all this stuff so they call me over and i start talking about somethings that have happend. Like the tarot readings i did with *someone* about a friend and how everything was pretty much dead on. Well....turns out that....grama starts saying "im sorry to tell you this stacey but tarot and witches are.......well..evil."My face turned bright red...i was so angry. She says have faith and stick with God..believe that jesus died for our sins. >then she says how Crystal is a real christian and how she was down the same road i was I worked for everything i've done ....god had no part in it. I went to church maybe a few times in my life....i never understood it. And to tell you the honest to goodness truth...when i was little and i'd pray b4 bed...id get terrible terrible unearthly dreams. I'd wake up sweating and crying. I totally stoped praying after that. And then i come to find out that my friend went to a baptist church just to see what it was about...(he's methodist) and they start saying 'god doesn't love you...your evil' shit like that..do i want to be apart of that?....hell no.   Plus....the bible says not to hate and love thy neighbor.....what if your neighbor is wiccan? or jewish?......whats gonna happen then. don't hate.....what about ppl who are gay?......illegal for gays to be married? thats a load of bull shit to me.  I don't want to be apart of that. I want todo what i want...be myself my own person and not follow someones rules. How do we even know god exists...like francesca said..some drunken person coulda written the bible and just sold it to someone. I'm not trying to bash anyone elses religion even though it may seem like i am but im just trying to stick up for what i believe in even if i have to lay it down for grama...my own blood doesn't even except me for what i believe in...im the same person that i've always been....just..wiccan. My friends understand what i believe....and i understand them too. I mean....has she even read the wiccan rede? 'An ye harm none, do what ye will' in other words...do what you want just dont hurt anyone in the process?....I don't care what religion you are...catholic, jewish, satanist, voodun.............frankly i don't give a u know what......as long as your doing what you think is right...go for it............question is why cant my family feel the same way?   great....they're back now so im going...
