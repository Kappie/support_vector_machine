Thirdly (?), I have some strange addiction to chocolate.  Well...I don't crave it. But when I have chocolate in my possession I sort of lose control.  I went to break off a piece (I have a giant, hollow Hershey's Kiss)...and one became two...and two three...and a few more.  Then I forgot the INITIAL reason I came into the room: to get my books to begin my homework.  I also had difficulty turning off the light switch.  Something is not right with that picture.  But, more later. I have papers to write!
