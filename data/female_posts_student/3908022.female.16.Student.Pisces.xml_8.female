But it still hurts.    I was sick. With depression last year and the beginning of this year. It started somewhere around September 2003 and ended in March 2004. But, really, it started before that. Actually I think it's been there for as long as I can remember.   The uncertainty. Never daring to trust anyone, at least not for real. I'm very reserved as a person. Even though I talk openly about things. I don't open up to just anyone. There are a few select people that get to see who I really am. But, there are even fewer that I really, truly trust. They are the peopleI love to death.     You know that thing  where you're supposed to fall back into someone else's arms when they're standing behind you? You're supposed to trust them?  Maybe you don't know about it...   Anyhow, I've only dared to do that once. Once in my 16 years of living.  People always nagged me about it. But, I think I have a problem with trust. But, only one way of trust. I mean, I trust a few people with my feelings and my opinions. But, the real kind of trust. Where I'd put my life in someone else's hands. That's the kind of trust I have a problem with.  How ever, the only time I ever did that fall back into someone's arms - thing was one time last year. With one of my best friends.  She's someone I really trust. Because she's so honest with me. And no matter how much honesty can hurt sometimes, there's nothing I appreciate more.     I was sick.. Back to that.   I was sick. Depressed, doubting everyone who claimed that they loved me, hating myself. Truly hating. Sometimes I would stand in front of the mirror wishing I could cut the skin off of my face, without anyone noticing. And I think I would've cut it off. If I didn't know that pealing your skin off gets you attention and not the good kind.  And that was the last thing I wanted at the time, attention.     But, I cut my wrists. That'sanother one of those  "All teenagersdo that"  things. AndthereforeI felt that it didn't matter somuch if I did it too.  It felt so good. Putting theknife to my skin. Feeling it cut through my skin, all my pain just pouring out.   In the form of blood .  It sounds sick, I know that .  But that's how I felt . It was an outlet for my feelings.  I wanted to die. To leave everything behind. Let go of it all, not having to worry anymore. But my friends noticed that I was hurting myself. And they were crying and screaming at me not to do it. I hated seeing them like that. But I still couldn't really feel that it was my fault. WhichI know it was.    I also had eating disorders, weeks could go by with me just eating an apple a day. And I just wasn't hungry. That's what I said when people asked. It was logical to me. I wasn't hungry. So, why eat?  I had this thing I did: In the morning, I didn't eat breakfast, so mom was worried and asked me why. I said that I'd buybreakfast and eat a huge lunch at school.  Of course I didn't buy breakfast! Where would I get the money to do that?  Then at lunch, my friends were worried about me not eating, so I said that I had a big breakfast and that I was going to eat snacks when I got home from school.  Then at dinner, mom's worried again, and I tell her that I ate really much at lunch.  It worked most of the time. And I didn't see that there was anything wrong with it. Which is crazy to me now.    Igot help. Or, rather my best friend found out and forced me to get help.  I talked to a counselor, and I really thought that I was better.She was proud of meand I felt happy again. Not happy all the time. But normal, the normal ups and downs. And Iatethe right way, too.   Everything was normal,  until last night .    Suddenly, I just found myself thinking: "nothing changed! I'm still as ugly as I ever was. I'm still stupid. And what makes me think that my friends love me? What haschanged? Nothing!!"    SoI started thinking about all of that. And I cut myself.It just felt so amazing.Once again, my problems and all the hurt justwent with the blood.  Not thatit bled alot, because it really didn't.  But it felt good.     And now I don't know what to do.    I don't know if it was a one time thing, last night.    I hope so. Because I really can't go through that hell again.  I don't think I'll survive that again.      I hate my self pitying.
