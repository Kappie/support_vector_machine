He's probably having a really great time, getting high and hanging out with his friends and shit. I'm semi- jealous of his freedom right now.        I went to Wonderland today. I was never big on amusement parks, I get sick easily. Rhiannon and I both got a bit nauseous, but mine was mostly from the bus ride to Toronto. I realized just how much I shouldn't be allowed coffee, and how much I love rollercoasters, but no one would go with me on Tomb Raider, which is a new rollercoaster, and no one would go on Top Gun with me, or Cliffhanger. I was upset. I know if Rem would have been there I would have went on all three of those.      I feel sick and achy. My back muscles are killing me and missing Rem this much is crazy, its making me sick. I need to sleep most likely. I can't wait until Rem gets home... its insane how much I love him and how amazing he is.      There is a serious lack of adjectives to describe just how he is so incredible. Quite possibly, love is blinding me from things that could possibly end up being an issue, but right now I dont want to have to worry about those things and just love him like I do. Which brings to mind how difficult I am making things for him sometimes. I guess I just subconciously test peoples love and trust because everyone always bails when things get difficult for me... there has never been anyone who has always been there for me... Rem and Rhiannon have been there for the hardships I have gone through recently and I can only hope I will have them for a long ass time... life without them just doesnt sound like living... right now, they are my life. They keep me sane, healthy and stable. It's bad to depend on people but they are helping me out alot.      My eyes itch for sleep. Night.     .:Sam:.
