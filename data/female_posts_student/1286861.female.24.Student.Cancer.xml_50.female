Basically, it likes to make the gaming world and the gamers in the world laugh...usually at the expense of themselves. urlLink  Brenden  introduced me to the site with these two "Victims". He said they sort of reminded him of me. Take a gander.         urlLink   Traci-Like Victim #1        urlLink  Traci -Like Victim #2
