(See previous posting from before seeing the show when I ragged on what I thought was going to be another 90210 deal.  But it's so not and I am hooked.)  Anyway, so Adam Brody is in this movie, he is Dustin, best friend to Eric.  Eric is played by Mike Vogel (also in MTV's Wurthering Heights and I also believe the new version of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre).  Eric is on a mission to get noticed, he is an exceptionally good skateboarder in the midst of mediocrity and with no sponsor.  He involves his best friends (one trying to go to college, one trying to get away from a girl's father, and one who seems just psycho and willing to follow Eric anywhere) in a scheme to get noticed by following pro skater Jimmy on his tour.  By the way, Jimmy is played by Jason London.  So anyway, they go on this road trip and get shot down time and time again but continue on their way to gain sponsorship and go pro.  I thought this movie was very funny and it was just fun in general.  It was slightly generic and very predictable but I laughed most of the time and the music playing throughout the movie was great.  Anyway, for those of you who have coulrophobia... be very worried because there is a whole scene with people in a school of this nature.....
