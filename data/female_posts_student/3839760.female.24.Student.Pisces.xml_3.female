I am trying not to stress out about the whole thing...first I start thinking that somehow I will miss the bus and not get there in time, then I think about my apperance and then what if I don't get the job and get totally stuck in this crap one I have now.  However, I need to stop and just be faithful and be confident that things turn out for a reasons, yet all that seems really quite useless to me at this moment. Well..until then, I will see what happens.
