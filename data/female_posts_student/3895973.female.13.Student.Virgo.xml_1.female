Most of the time i play The Sims Online and i dont really sleep alot im mostly up from 6pm-11am i like the night its alot more peaceful, I guess the day is just well to bright haha. I like to watch tv i have a couple favorite shows and thats the only thing i watch. I dont date to much i guess i just havent met anyone that i feel comfortable around.
