Hurley , yeah that's your favorite brand You want to fuck a dog in the ass Upon your ass is where   I   want to lay my hand I wish for show and tell I could bring you to class.  Your voice and  music  inspires me When I sleep you are what I dream Your smile and perfect teeth fill me with glee If I ever saw you in  naked in a wheelchair  I'd scream  I love the way your  hair  falls in your eyes Sometimes you hold it to the side with gel   I   want   you  to  lay   your   hands   on   my    thighs  for me to meet you I'd go through  hell .  Looking at you and hearing your voice is orgasmic You make me all hot and wet If you ever had a  bo  ne  r  I'd ask to touch your  dick  And  Ava she will grow up and be great so don't fret .   Your wife is the luckiest person ever I wish I could be the one you  kiss  goodnight If you asked me if I would ever hurt you my answer is never For you a million bulls I  would  fight .  I love you  Tom  this is no lie I want to stand in front of you and  gaze into your eyes  Knowing that you will never be mine makes me cry If you ever needed one I'd let you have my hair tie.  I don't want to sound like  every  girl out there But its hard not to when  everyone  wants you  Now  I see why  everyone  says life's not fair All I know is that my love for you is sincerely true.   Okay, so I admit it. I didn't write this poem. But the person who did most be my friggin' clone because thats exactly how I feel about Tom Delonge. If you don't know who he is you have major issues and you're a loser.      In other news...
