Oh man, and today in Mrs. Foote's class, we got to watch Ice Age, which I'd never seen before...and it was sooo funny!  It was great...me and Florin were passing notes across the room like the entire time..until Mrs. Foote caught me, lol.  But we kept doing it even after that.  Then in 4th, all I did was talk to people.  After school, I was almost in a wreck (haha, j/k, but I did have a close call)..then I got home, had some oreos, debated on whether or not to go running, decided not to, and played some piano.  :)  I'm so glad that I don't have to go to school until 10:30 tomorrow (for exam review)..that means extra sleep!  :)  Ahh, life is good.  Later  >
