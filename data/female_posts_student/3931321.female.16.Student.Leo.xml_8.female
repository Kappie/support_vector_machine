We got some lovely FRENCH beer thrown at us... (I have always said that french people should die!! So I am saying it again!). I got in a lil fight with a red haired kid who is about 13. So after he almost died... me and hamilton and vanessa and jodee went crusin in the TOPAZ to Dairy Queen. We also saw the Topaz's twin... whose name is Marcel. So we went cruisin' home playing with some MARSHMALLOWS!! and windows. and even the fuckin' doors. Yeah. We ARE RETARTED!     ........and that was my day.. I have a hair appointment 'morrow. TO FIX MY EDGAR! (thanks carolyn!)I really wish that people would fuckin' be online so I can talk to hem But sadly... they are losers and not spendin their night on MSN!
