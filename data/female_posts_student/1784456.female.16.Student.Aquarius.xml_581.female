(Hallelujah!) *don't start* Then we get a big piece of popcorn and we get a pink giraffe to eat it and then it blows up like a balloon. We send it to the White House and the oh so clever George Bush thinks it's an alien and decided to pop it and eat it. Little does he know that the pink giraffe has also eaten a chemical that makes you believe whatever some one tells you. So George, being the good guy that he is gobbles it all down and then we burst into his office and tell him he's a monkey. So he wanders off, acting like a monkey and the whole world gets thrown into turmoil becuase the pink giraffe turns out to actually be an alien, a blue one. So we jump in and claim we're aliens too and take over the Earth! Good eh? Sorry, majorly bored! Eugh, gotta go do something! Bisi! Hehe... shopping on  urlLink amazon ? Sounds good to me! :) :) :)
