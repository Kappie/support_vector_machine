Teachers are the most crule ppl who ever lived on the surface of the Earth...especially ours who have this knack for pulling us like rubber bands and i feel that someday i break like one *TWANG* and thatll be the end of me and the mental balance i have retained till now.If i knew that we were going to be treated like this i wouldnt have worked so hard on retaining my mental capabilities. Teachers come into class and tell us that there will be no tests today.....no science tests no geography tests....oh and that they forgot to tell us yesterday even though they knew ...WOW! thats pretty nice u just "forgot" and made us sit up like sleepy donkeys drinking coke,red bull and mountain dew and coming to school like zombies....ever heard of beauty sleep?i got a pimple cus of the teachers hmmph!!and then the fukin asshole we have for a principal saw me copying a sum out of this gals book oh man im in shit....  Singing arabic hymns is just not my thig but how do u explain to teachers? i dunno sumone please get me Alanis Morissetes Ironic.....
