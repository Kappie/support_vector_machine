Tomorrow is my first day of Vocational training program. I am not really looking forward for it. I dont know about tomorrow. Feeling abit scare... Attachment in a new enviroment and alone.  It's a catholic hospital i know. I know i'm not alone, as God is always with me. But no... Hope I can start this whole attachment good, though alone...   He, he... can he please give me comfort... I guess he doesnt know how i am feeling now... He must have too much to care, then to care for me... and also... even if i tell him my feelings, will he care much....  Seems like there are more others who give more concern than he gives...  But what i said the previous line, is it fair to him... haiz...
