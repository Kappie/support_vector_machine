I realize it's only one of the issues, but my friends, this nation has never, in two centuries and more, made a worse foreign policy mistake."    Now, regardless of where you stand on the U.S. involvement in Iraq, surely most of us can see that IT IS NOT EVEN OVER YET, so perhaps it is too soon to be jumping to conclusions.  Oh, and...ahem...can anybody say "Vietnam."  I don't think this war is quite to the Vietnam stage; it may get there--I don't happen to think it will, but it is a subject on which there can be valid disagreement--but I don't think we're there yet.  And I think it is a strange, and potentially dangerous thing, to make historical judgments about a given event when we are still deep in the midst of it.    That, and he should have said "in two centuries and change," because it just sounds cooler.
