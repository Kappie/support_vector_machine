I read some  Harry Potter  throughout the day, only to be yelled at 1,000 times by my mom, because I wasn't helping her clean. I managed to get out of cleaning pretty much all day. I just cleaned her car, that was my only contribution. My mom and I planned a college visiting trip to see Purdue and DePaul in Chicago. I hope that goes through. But I also want to see Drexel in Philly and University of Maryland- and my mom says if my dad will pay for it, I can just fly there and go by myself! Isn't that crazy?! I would have a nice time by myself.  I went to CVS to use my coupon for 50 digital pictures for $10, it took me like an hour. Some hick in front of me couldn't use the machine, and ooh it was stressful. I developed this old picture of me and Erica in Stratford, and the lady goes, "Oh are you related?" I thought she was kidding so I was laughing and saying no. Then she goes, "But you have the same smile!" I still thought she was kidding, but then this other woman, who hadn't seen the picture, asked if we looked alike, and the lady goes "Yeah, they do." But there was no sarcasm to her voice. I think she was serious- what an idiot! I got really random pictures developed.  Earlier I watched Best Month Ever on VH1- it was just all the best parts of Best Week Ever compiled into one show, but it was still so funny! That's like my favorite show, along with Last Comic Standing, I love to laugh! Did you know there is a Best Week Ever blog? It's great... http://bestweekever.vh1.com/  But eww they're saying that Hillary Duff and Joel from GC are dating! That's so gross, I'm going to find him at Warped Tour and call him out as the white trash perv he is- trust me I have no fear of that piece of ass. It's horrible, but I never plan on using violence against another human being, just the power of my words to show them that they are nothing and stupid and have no purpose on this Earth, and that I am their queen. WHAHAHA. I also watched Stevo 32 from Sum 41 on Cribs. He is really funny. Deryck was there eating a hot dog- my two favorite foods: Deryck Whibley and hot dogs. NUM NUMS! At one point Stevo goes, "Here's my boy: Bob Barker!" and it scans to an autographed picture of Bob- I loved that show! Dave Brownsound and Cone were there too- I really miss them/will never see them live. Maybe one day. As I've said, Carrot Top is our link to blink. Now I'm just rambling. But you guys- Lizzie showed me this great interview with Tom DeLonge about his support for Kerry and all that- it was so hot. I'm super attracted to boys who are involved (aka that kid I've talked about, even though he's blonde) and I want to help out too, it's really important! So go out there ladies and be political, that's all I have to say.
