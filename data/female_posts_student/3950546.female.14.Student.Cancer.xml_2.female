LOL Dont ask why I named my blog this, I guess its cos of my strong hate for Avril Lavigne, lol, its not just me that hates her skanky guts though, I was looking through the msn groups the other day and found heaps of Anti Avril army's, I even joined one! Yes, well enough the so called "punk" and more about me! (-: Well, my name is Alex and I live in the great country of Australia, where it's very hot, ~wipes her brow~, and no, I dont talk like Steve Irwin and have a pet Kangaroo. I am into all sports except tennis, cant stand it. I play soccer and netball, my positions are left wing, goalie and defense for soccer and I only started playing netball this year and am experimenting with all positions but my faves so far have to be GA and WA. I really like eminem, 50 cent, Chingy, Simple Plan, Outkast, good Charlotte, Avril Lavigne (just kidding), Evanescence but my favourite is Blink 182, they rock ma socks! Well, thats all I can think of right now, cyaz p.s. - its my bday on Tuesday! Cant wait!
