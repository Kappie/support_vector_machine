I had a diet coke and the 4 of us split a cookie. (it was a big cookie) Then we walked to Rachel's house. We started watching Kill Bill Volume 2. I hated it a lot. It was so boring. Then Joe came over and he and Rachel got into a long discussion in the back room and Christian and I psycho analyzed Rachel for a while. Christian got really mad. Then Jeremiah left and Christian and I ended up sitting outside. Then Christian got mad and left. He was mad at me because I wouldn't leave with him. I mean Rachel was clearly having a problem with her boyfriend and I think that if we had anything to say to her, it needed to wait until she wasn't fighting with Joe. Then Joe and Rachel resolved what they needed to resolve and we hung out. It was a lot of fun. I have never had a problem with Joe, I think Christian wants me to hate him, because Christian hates him. Then Joe went home and Rachel went to band practice and I went home. Then dad and I had pizza and watched some of Addams family values. That movie is so funny. Christiana Ricci has all the best lines in that movie. ( Amanda Buckman : Why are you dressed like somebody died?  Wednesday : Wait. ) Then I went to bed at about 10:45. This morning I woke up at 10:30. I watched some ER (the one where Abby deals with her mothers Manic depressive disorder) It was disturbing for me. Then i did some packing and some laundry (oooh fun) and watched some Lord of the Rings extras and I watched emperors club and now I am watching the commentary. And I still haven't had a chance to talk to Ben! I did talk to Kimmy on the phone and yea... He's odd. I miss HCT a lot. It's so sad. You spend you're whole year waiting for these five weeks and then before you can even blink it's over. I hate that. And who knows when I will have another chance to see all these people. And the really scary thing? I almost always know what my next show is and this time I really don't. I was going to SM for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Heather had asked me to earlier in the year but now she is not directing it. I have emailed Rick about it but they don't have a director yet. I am really hoping to get to work on it and I hope a lot of the kids will too. Especially the kids who have graduated from Discovery Company. They are really great kids and I hope they don't leave. I"m really afraid of us all growing up and leaving. I suppose the most important thing is how much fun I've had and how much I love HCT. It's sad though, how everyone's leaving. So many people have left this year, graduated, moved, or just left. I miss them. Earlier this year something made me think about all these people who are gone from HCT. It was frightening to think that all of these people who, like, are HCT for me, are people who have been gone for years. Sometimes it's odd how it seems that all these things that happened 5 or 6 years ago (god it's been a long time) seem like they happened just yesterday. Well I think that this has actually been a rather short post! I will end this with listen to Wicked it's amazing! I really love that musical. Andrew asked me last night what the most beautiful song I had ever heard was. I really don't know. It puzzled me. Leave a comment if you have any thoughts.  I've heard it said
