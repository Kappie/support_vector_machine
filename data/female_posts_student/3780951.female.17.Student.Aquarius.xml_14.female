I cant be as creative as the person who write the BIG TRUTHS. ;-) so i'm just rambling. dont get me wrong, dont think i get sad because people dont post (;-)). and i am i happy child. look at the people i hang out with, susan, amy (we still havnt ran 3miles), jonathan, randy, linds, and all you other great great people. its just at 11:30 theres not to many people to talk to. the ones you want to talk to are in Hilton Head or Hawaii. and the other ones have jobs and have to get up in the morning. but i am entertaining myself watching Footlose. this is the frist time i've seen it. i know i'm a little behind.   i ate mexican tonite. it was quit delectable. then i went to see my g'ma. she's great. quit the wise crack!! now i'm talking to angela about my hot math teacher mr. ramsey. he was in tiger roar...mmm mmmmm good!! LOL JK!  i'm out...HOLLA
