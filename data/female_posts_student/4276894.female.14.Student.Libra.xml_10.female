This summer started out the same. Sat by the pool, sipping a cocktail, getting a nice tan. Then, one unfortunate day, you notice a cloud looming over your so-far promising summer. And just like that, the rain starts. First, Hurricane Alex, then Tropical Storm Bettie, and now Hurricane Charley. So, in short, fuck Florida for sending us there shitty weather!   I have reason to believe that Hurricane Charley is going to severely disrupt my party, and I am very displeased at this! Why is it that last year was glorious sunshine aaaall summer and this year has been truly crappy? Because England's weather completely sucks!   This summer has been like living in a bloody rainforest. It's hot and humid, then it rains alot, so everything is wet, hot and humid. When it stops raining, we all race outside to grab as much sun as possible before the next downpour. Nothing can ever get dry, because as soon as it starts drying off, it rains again. So, all outside furniture and any other poor things you may have left outside will spend their entire summer wet and slowly decomposing.   This post wasn't that exciting. But, I'm very cross at the moment. It's sunny right now, but there is a huge black cloud hanging over Basingstoke, which is where I'm going later. Oh, joy.... I can't wait to stand in the rain, huddle under an umbrella, and then run to shelter in the 5 minutes between showers. Grrr... it pisses me off.. just as you start venturing out from the shelter you have found, the rain comes down in all it's glory!    But, the worst thing is, England doesn't make an effort to store any of this water, in case of drought. No, they say, it will rain again. After all, it always rains in England. It's like the fact that England is the windiest European country and yet we have almost no wind turbines and even the ones we try to build, people complain about.   Anyway, I'm starying slightly from the point here, my point was the weather sucks and don't we all know it! Stupid meteorologists.... ruining my day         Peace,
