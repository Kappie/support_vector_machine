Stealing is BAD. Violence is BAD. Drugs are BAD. (Sorry, I've had my chocolate today.    Unfortunately.   )  Yeah, I'm shuddering, too. Alim'to is like braces. No one should have to go through that.    It's highly nutritional, though. You Tau'ri put too much stock in taste.     I see. Maybe we could have done without the fronkeys. To be truthful, the angels described in the Bible sound just as freaky-looking.  *Sees what Elizabeth did to Jack and helps him up.* What you do to these poor people trying to make an honest living!  *sics Garshie, a black husky mix, on Inuyasha* You know what, dog face? I like Jenn. I think she's got a great sense of humor. I'm not going to let you insult her, got it, mutt-boy? I think you're cute and all, but I'm not letting that get in my way. *Garshie chomps down on InuYasha's puffy red pants and doesn't let go, despite the half-demon's flailing.* And don't you dare laugh, Sparrow, or you're next. Garshie isn't quite as tame as he looks!  Umm... Church? You alright?  Wait, a   demon   likes the X-files? *rolling on the floor, laughing. Garshie returns to sniff Sarah's face.*  *Sarah composes herself.* I like your Jack Sparrow accent, Jenn. It's better than mine!  Alright. Sorry to be rude and all, but who invited all of you? (Hakkai, Sanzo, Goku, Gojyo, and for the most part, Buddha)  Oh, food's the problem? *whips out several unmarked plastic bags with mushy stuff like grits and chicken salad in them* If you're really hungry, the base cafeteria insisted I bring some of this home. I don't really like it, so you're more than welcome to take the whole stock. *whips out chocolate bar and starts to eat it* This is more my    *spits out chocolate* I will   not   have any of that near me!!!    C'mon, Vinnet? I'll let you eat some peanut butter when we get home....    Fine. *pouts* As long as I can eat enough to rinse the poison from my mouth.    Um, Vinnet? It's   my   mouth. I hope you realize that.  How nice of you guys to play two of my favorite classic rock songs! Anyone know "Breakfast" or other Newsboys songs? The really famous Switchfoot song? Audio A?  Well, um, Jenn... I've heard you sing a little....  Wow!! Mr. K, you know a word I don't know! Happy, happy! You should be chuffed!
