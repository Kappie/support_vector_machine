Apparently he's into me too, which would be totally awsome, except for this one little thing. He's got this thing where he told himself that he wouldn't date, cuz he doesn't see the point in it at our age. I totally can see his point of view, and respect that.... at the same time though, I'm sad, cuz i like him a lot. He's such a nice guy, and a good catch. The fact that he likes me too doesn't help my situation any, but there's not much i can do. So, any suggestions? My predicion: even though he says he doesn't date, something's gonna develop anyway, then that'll be real confusing!   -Ali
