So many dates, and goals and things that I thought I would have during the month, I have not yet come to do. All I have done was simply push back all the plans and crammed it to the last 10 days of the month and am now facing the consequences of being a lazybum.   Stuck in a tornado field at the moment. My mind spins in all directions, picking up everything around me and being my own big plasma membrane - taking in what I need and pushing out what I don't need. Only thing is, my cell's plasma membrane actually knows what it's doing. I have no idea whatsoever. All the taking in and excreting have no connection, no use, no facts. I'm just doing what I feel is right. And that's usually never good as I'm 99.9% of the time dead-flat wrong.   I go around feeding myself fallacies I've created on my own.  "Kim, you're fine."  "Kim, you've got this under control."  "Kim, you'll be okay. Things will calm down."  It's such a paradox when you lie to yourself. You know it's all lies, but yet you feel better. I'll never understand our emotions, ever. I don't think anyone will in general anyways.   And I guess I've been just wallowing here, by myself. Slowly, but surely in my own melee. Nothing to mewl about, nothing aberrant. I could ask for succour but it'd just be a waste of time, and the persons time. It's just one of those phases we get through. The kind we go through atleast 2438473 times a year - only difference is we all take it differently. I, as we can all tell, don't take it as winsome as I should. I choose to be weak and just drown in my melange of complication, depression and anxiety.   I'll snap out of it eventually.  Hopefully anyways.  It's been a good month. Not so good with the rush and everything - but nothing I can complain about. It was rather mild but somehow rather ... disturbing. I'll never understand these things. I'll never know how to explain it either.   Maybe I'm right about the phase. About the lonely phase we often get. Everythings so loud, everyone's pretty much everywhere; yet you're in a glass bubble. You're alone and you're unheard.   THAT or I'm listening to too many angsty, lost, and sad music.
