Good news!  I found my cell phone and my coat in the span of a week.  Maybe I'll find some other stuff I've lost, like my first three retainers. Why do you think some people are mean?  We were discussing that during chemistry, and I can't come up w/ an answer.  Is it a need to look good?  Is it a pent up frustration?  Is it just cruelty?  Here's what Shaheen says: I believe people are mean because it makes them feel better about themselves to put others done. It is a twisted trait, but such is human nature. It's all perception.  Here's what my cousin Stephanie says: i dont know. Another deep question: why do we instantly hate some people and instantly like some people?  Most of the time hate or like/love develops over time, but sometimes it's instant.  Again, Shaheen's perspective:  TDMonMon05:  why do u think we instantly hate or like/love some people   TDMonMon05:  u there   Winkalink:  pheromones  Winkalink:  yes   Winkalink:  sorry, I was talking to Michael  Winkalink:  and I got sidetracked  Winkalink:  but I am here   TDMonMon05:  o     Winkalink:  yes:)  TDMonMon05:  what are pheremones   Winkalink:  pheromone:  Noun A chemical secreted by an animal, especially an insect, that influences the behavior or development of others of the same species, often functioning as an attractant of the opposite sex. Etymology Greek pherein, to carry; see bher-1 in Indo-European roots + (hor)mone. Other forms pher'oÂ·mon'al adj. Well there u have it.  I wonder why chemicals can make us instantly attracted or repulsed by someone (by this time, my cousin was away so I didn't ask her). One more deep question: beyond pheremones, what causes a person to dislike or like someone (not necessarily instantly).  Shaheen's perspective:  Winkalink: behavior towards one another Winkalink: first impressions are a huge part TDMonMon05: well my first impression of u was that u were rele nice and u had pretty hair Winkalink: haha thanks :-) TDMonMon05: lets see...since ur talkin to michael, I thought he was rele smart and had nice eyes [a few deleted lines cause it's not nice to talk badly about people, which I realized today cause it's just as bad as teasing...so no more trashing people in my blog unless I'm really mad] TDMonMon05: I do remember mine of Cory, which was in second grade though Winkalink: ah, Cory:-) Winkalink: I remember that TDMonMon05: for kindergarten and first, Wells, and second through fifth Curtis Winkalink: I thought he said his name was Horn TDMonMon05: haha Winkalink: it was september 4, 2001 TDMonMon05: I didn't like him very much cause he called me Nicholean the donkey (our teacher read us a story about Napoleon the Donkey) Winkalink: in geometry Winkalink: he was sitting with scott TDMonMon05: first day of school? Winkalink: who I thought was spot Winkalink: yes TDMonMon05: haha Winkalink: that's when we met TDMonMon05: were u in Mrs T.'s class? Winkalink: yes TDMonMon05: cool  As you can see, Shaheen's a genius.  I'll leave you with my usual quizilla results and this conversation which will serve as joke of the day.  Winkalink: I'm helping Michael start a classical music collection TDMonMon05: well I think that's about all as far as the deep questions. Winkalink: :-) TDMonMon05: haha make sure to get some Pink Floyd, Elvis, Joan Baez, and The Eagles Winkalink: no no Winkalink: not classic rock TDMonMon05: good music from every decade except the 90s Winkalink: classical TDMonMon05: those are the classics Winkalink: no TDMonMon05: o like with violins and stuff Winkalink: the real classics Winkalink: yes, with violins and stuff TDMonMon05: get mozart, bach, betovhen, tchaikovsky, and wolfgang puck Winkalink: :-) TDMonMon05: o wait wolfgang puck's a chef Winkalink: I've got them all Winkalink: except that last one Winkalink: lol Winkalink: wolfgang was Mozart's middle name TDMonMon05: o  Well quizilla is broken, so no quiz result today.  I'll just have to settle for a newfound knowledge of Vivaldi as taught by Shaheen.
