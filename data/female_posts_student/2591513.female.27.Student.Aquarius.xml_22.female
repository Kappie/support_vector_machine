     
      I have been out of the loop...maybe trying to figure out life, maybe contemplating the tests that I am being brought to.  I don't know.  I am however looking forward to planning my daughter's chirstening, which sadly took the back burner to the drama in our lives.  So anyway, just letting you all know I am still here, just contemplating life...I will be back on here to write what I have come to the conclusion about it.
