I 4got 2 tell mi Mum 2 wake me up at 7.15 instead of the usual 7.30, so i get woken up at 7.30, screaming "Shit, Shit, Shit, KC's 'sposed 2 pick me up at 7.25!!!" I  jump  out of bed, and then I see Casey walking up to my door, I'm rushing to put mi clothes on, while Mi mum is trying to put lunch in mi bag, I rush out the door, ready in a record 30 secs (no over-exaduration) I jump in KC's car half-dressed, breakfast and hair-brush thrusted into mi hand, mi half-packed bag being dragged along behind me while at the same time I am busting 2 pee and are still half asleep. It ended up that once we got 2 the bus stop our bus was  20 minutes late!  So I ended up at school late anyway, and had no time 2 eat and get ready before I had 2 rush off to class! Torture, i tell you torture. Not 2 mention it was freezing!  Well, the infamous Criddy strikes again. 'Cept this time she's the FUN NAZI!! She arrives into class with her prostitute makeup on - think bright red lipstick and blue eyeshadow! (about 2 seconds after I rush in there half-ready) and has another physco at Hannah and I because we were pretendin 2 be DJ's and making lots of DJ like CD-scratching nosises -"Settle down girls!" she croaks (hahah - mission "antaginate Criddy" complete!) Mel decides to ask  WHY  she named her son Bead, and then she started 2 tell us about how it was actually spelt Bede, and " NO , it  IS NOT  short for anything!", and how it was one of the oldest most  amazingly wonderful  names in history. All this while we r trying 2 stifle our laughter. Mel started to ask her if she had had a haircut and Criddy took it all wrong, and had a physco at poor Mel who was just trying 2 make convo, and threatedned 2 send her up to Dr. Kamperos office! hehehe.....  Quite an eventful day. Although I arrived home feeling sick again! :(
