My expectations were not very high really based on the number of times I've been out of the house to do kawad Bomba since the beginning of April.  Didn't emphasize too much on my studies that time because it was just too exhausting but equally fun to be drilled in such a way that your coccyx protests by giving problems for a freaking week.  Took it all in without any complaints as this is my last year in school.  So where will I be after this? Oh god, I hope not in National Service.  Just dread the idea of "community bathing".  I'd love to get someone's opinion on this.  Oh yes, I sidetracked on the subject of my exam results.  Nothing to boast about and I still don't have the feeling of urgency in my studies which proves why I am not performing very well at this time of the year when I really should start kicking my own butt.  Looking back, there were and still are, plenty of distractions-tv, radio, Spongebob, parties and now, it's the deadly procrastination habit that has to be rid of from my brain.  Ok, let me set this for the record: Now that everything has settled, meaning that the party's over , my only focus has to be on studies and from now onwards it's "  WORK HARD, HAVE EVERYTHING LATER".  To be more specific, almost 4 months to put everything in order and then it's a new, endless freedom to break free from this idiotic, monotonous school life that really bores me to death and doesn't have much to offer.  Still scared of driving actually but nevermind, I'll have to tumpang somebody or maybe just find the courage to face Friday night's traffic to Bangsar.  There's a perfect reason to go there, right Maha?
