Towards the end of class she was bouncing on her computer chair and then switched to a sort of pelvic thrusting motion. During her humping of the chair she winked very obviously at Gabe. Not a joke-ish sort of wink either, more of a "See what I'm doing to this chair? I'd rather be doing this to you." sort of wink. Gabe just stared in horror.   Last night was horrible, I got a total of 2 1/2 hours of sleep. It was horribly hot last night, which is odd because its never warm at all here. At least not this time of year. So where the 88 degree night came from I do not know. The windows in my room are the double-window sort and since the outside ones had not been removed it was impossible to cool the place down. At 4AM I was completely prepared to march outside with a screwdriver and a ladder and fix this problem but my dad stopped me. Evidently he didn't want to pay the hospital bills that would have resulted. So I spent most of my night petting Harvey and reading. Bah. Lack of sleep had surprisingly little effect on my day though, nothing copious amounts of caffeine and make-up couldn't hide.  Alice is back from New York. She's bought me a t-shirt and a new watch too. Thank god, my last watch is still somewhere in Australia... Don't even ask.   Steph and I snuck into the lunchroom today, possibly the saddest thing ever. They should really stop locking it during classes though, people still need food you know. Anyway we snuck in through the kitchens, humming the theme song from "Mission Impossible" the entire time. The lunch ladies just shot us nasty looks though.  So, normal day altogether...
