This winter I listened to it every morning on the subway on my way to school. It can lighten up any shitty swedish winter day, though the sun hasn't rised when you get up in the morning and has already gone down when you get out of school.   Today wasn't like that, though. I woke up really early, like nine... Now in the summer I have to set my alarm clock to wake up before noon, and today I had promised Ellen and Nicole to meet them at eleven. We were going into town to get some fabric, to sew a new bag for our water-pipe Mohamed (Yes, we named our water-pipe! So what?). We met about one o'clock... But we found some great fabric though, orange with the right 70's touch. Love!   Haha. Right now my brothers cellphone rang. I put on some really funky disco music and pumped up the volume... He locked himself in the bathroom. That's what brothers are for!   After our shopping tour we went to the beach. We have to take advantage of the only sunny day of July this far, so we managed to catch some of the evening sun...   On the way home from the beach on my bike, I just leaned back and let my hands off the handle. And it worked! I know, learning to bike without holding on to your handle by seventeen is... well, stupid. I had a friend, Ellinor, who tried to teach me that in fourth grade, but I just couldn't do it. I was so happy when I biked past her house todaywithout holding the handle! I'm reallystill a child, but hey... If it makes me that happy it just can't be a bad thing! Right?   Now after dinner I'm sitting here listening to "Me and Bobby McGee" with Janis Joplin, waiting for Ellen, Nicole and My to come over so we can start sewing our bag. I've started working on a CD which is meant to be a collection of old summer songs... Like "That summer feeling". It's absolutely impossible to find anywhere, so I'm really annoyed. It's a great song! Has anyone of you got it? Cause I'd really like to have it, my summer CD wouldn't be complete without it! Please tell me if you happen to have it on your computer...Pleeease?   Oh, now Ellen and My came over... Bye bye  Hug
