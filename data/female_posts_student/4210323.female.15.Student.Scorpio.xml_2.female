And perhaps they'll never disappear But knowing that you’re here with me, Makes everything easier to bear. I realize, that if we have never met Right now, I wouldn’t be here You say that you never really cared Or that you never really helped But you also say that you’re useless And yet you’re always there when I’m a mess You also say you never do anything But you never stopped listening You also say you’re not a good friend But you always had a free hand to lend and a shoulder for me to cry on The fact that you were there and that you never left me Meant more to me than anything else If you still don't believe me Then there’s nothing I can ever say or do To make you believe this is all true But even if you refuse to believe, just remember That for everyday that I’m alive It’s all thanks to you, and that’s not a lie.
