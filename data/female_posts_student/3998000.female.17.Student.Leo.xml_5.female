That last privilege is one that will impact many, many lives, more so then usual, and if all us "young people" do not participate in this very important act, things could go horribly wrong. Tonight I was schooled on this, and I was forced to grow up a little bit.  In order to vote properly, you have to have a set of ideals, know whether any of the candidates share in these ideals, and be willing to compromise on their ideals you do not share. I was never one to follow politics, its so messy. Candidates are too concerned with getting votes than just showing who they are and what they will do. Its about getting elected, not leading the country. I knew that this was something I'd eventually have to get into because I hate the thought of being a stupid "young person" who doesn't care less about where the country is headed. I just didn't expect it to come so soon.  So I joined my new roomie and her friends at Fridays tonight for some late night munchies. We began discussing Kerry and Bush (there were 2 VERY SUPPORTIVE Kerry-ins) and everyone else didn't have much to say. I decided to play Devils Advocate just to see where it would go. From the Presidential Election we moved to Gay marriages and progressed to Religion. We were a bunch of late teens discussing the major debates of society. It felt good.  But as good as it felt at the time, I look back on it now and realize that I like to discuss topics, not get in heated debates about them. We almost got to that point tonight. And with my firm beliefs about my religion and the good man upstairs, sometimes people get defensive when discussing these fragile concepts. Case and point: Do not get into a discussion about the differences between the Roman Catholic Church and the Episcopal (Anglican) Church with a Catholic and an Anglican... It may get ugly. But the point I'm trying to make is that if everyone could put their thoughts aside for a moment and realize that sometimes there's another way of looking at things, maybe things would be a little bit easier. Maybe this scramble for presidency wouldn't be a competition for votes, but a a competition for values. Things get interesting between two people when they can listen to each others differences without taking it as a personal offense.  Maybe I'm just too naive to realize the harsh realities of life. Maybe I just need to take off these glasses... Maybe I have a point.       Sleep tight.  I now travel to my dreams, where forever I will be young
