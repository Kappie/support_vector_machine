The school day was an uneventful, dragging, and paradoxically lethargic nuisance, but at least lab was entertaining, even as Patrick and I argued jokingly (I think). We're getting along well, and I'm relieved. I was initially worried that we wouldn't get along because we are very much alike although the resemblance isn't easy to see immediately. Overall, though, I believe that there is a mutual liking of each other and each other's mind. We had a very good conversation about snot yesterday, as a matter of fact.   I'd like to thank both Kim and Mr. Coleman for the cookies. You can't begin to imagine how much better I felt after eating them (again, the Aleve wasn't too gentle on the stomach).   Anyway, I went to the Pottery room dopo scuola to wait on Lyndsey, who had to do some makeup work. Met a really cool girl, Leigh, and while we were talking and Lyndz was throwing on the wheel, I said, "Hey, I wanna do that!"  So I did.  To begin, I was doing pretty well. Eventually, Mr. Sizemore came into his room and helped me, too. He seems as though he were a really awesome teacher. He is one of the VERY few art teachers who believe in actual self-expression through art, and he is really nice, too. I would really like to take that class, but I don't have any room for it (not to mention that I am convinced that I would fail).   Eventually, I ruined the cool vase that I was creating, and I learned that one can't simply start over from a prior disaster. It is A LOT harder to do than it seems, this throwing on the wheel. I made a mess and soaked the throwing wheel area with clay water (which we then cleaned up well), and I had clay all over my jeans (still do), but it was so totally worth it and quite an exciting experience.  We left the school at approximately five o' clock, and we went to ATL Bread Co. to get  muchly deserved Cafe Mochas. It is really true that ATL Bread Co. Cafe Mochas make everything better, and the coffee was saliently good tonight. I had never seen the girl who made it before, but I doubt she was new. Perhaps, she may have simply worked when we weren't there (although that would be very little time to work, if it were so).   Had a good "no pressure over cafe mocha" (hehe) conversation about various stuff. 'Twas nice and muchly needed.  Went to Lyndz's. Talked to 'rents. Fun stuff. I love those people. Mr. Lee tried to show me how to thingy the bow, but my performance with it was very poor because I wasn't strong enough to pull it back. Lyndsey pulled my arm while he pulled the bow-- 'twas a tug-of-war between daughter and father, with my arm as a medium. Lyndsey pulled it spontaneously (without outside help, get it? Oh, stop giving my blog odd looks, Kim. We just finished the chapter, cut me some slack! =-P), but she is stronger than me. It was fun all the same.    We were on the verge of playing SC II when Kevin called about a fight that was supposed to happen. Lyndsey was, for some reason, excited about it, so I figured, "What the heck."  We went to the supposed there, and they decided on a different location, initiating a messy mission of follow-the-leader-in-your-car (which, by the way, is pretty interesting with the Noir song which plays during killing missions--"Canta per Me"), but then, they scoowampled to go elsewhere and eventually to a stupid high school party, a proliferation of plans we resolved not to catenate with them on. We returned to Lyndz's instead, and I'm very glad we did so. Kevin's a nice guy, but he seems like an idiot. Not a mentally challenged case, but simply an immature, fun-loving, idiotic high school kid. This isn't to say I dislike him (no sarcasm intended)!  When we arrived, her dad said, "I got some cans out in the yard for you."   I more than obviously grinned and took up the invitation to shoot without waiting to be asked twice. Lyndz and I shot a while. I think I'm getting better. ^.^          Only played with the rifle, though, and learned how to put it on safety.   Sat out on the cool swing on such a wonderful evening. Then, played some good, quality SC II. I've become sucky at it versus Lyndsey, but it's still fun. Then, came home.    I had a really good time and needed it, badly.   It's really good to be able to simply kick back and have fun, as I am still a kid and that's what I'm supposed to do. I'm glad it's good, (mostly) safe, clean fun although the idead of going out and impersonating an utter imbecile seems inspiring, from time to time. I'm really glad we didn't do that , though.   Asia should arrive tonight, finally. She's completely black with green eyes. I need to set up a kitty litter box for her.I'll do that in a bit.   I have a concert tomorrow at First United Methodist at 7 pm. If you have nothing better to do, feel free to come, but don't expect much-- the NHS choir sucks to insufferable extents this semester.  Ms. Bizarth got really frustrated today and walked out on our class. She said it was the most immature group she's ever had to work with, and I believe her. I do admit that I'm perennially whispering to Kim if I have a chance, but I try to respect B all the same. What it all boils down to is that the current sophomore class came in and totally screwed everything up. I remember when I was a freshman, the mixed choir was awesome. When I was a sophomore, it was a little less awesome, but we still kicked butt. Now, it's just trash. So, B gets bitter about it; I think I understand, actually. It's her life. Music is what she does. To see it all go down the drain because of a stupid little jerkoff who can't respect anyone and affects the rest of his section negatively (Grayson) would make me mad, too. So, she gets bitter and mean, and we, in turn, get bitter and mean (and start to detest Ms. B like I'm starting to do). There's a lot of hatin' going on in our choir, and that's a problem. One can't make music if he/she/it can't get along with the people he/she/it is making music with. Sure, it's possible, but it is nowhere near as majestic and rewarding an experience as it could be if there were harmony within the participants. There has to be a common love for music and feeling of relevance of the activity, or else it's trash. Right now, I feel as though I were totally wasting a class/credit, and that makes me mad. I wanted to be able to make music with good people daily with a good, sane conductor, but I'm not sure that'll ever happen again.  Oh, yeah, and I'm doing a County Honor Choir at some point soon. I think the performance is April 1 for the inauguration of the new Performing Arts Center, though I can't remember when rehearsals are and I don't have music yet. But I committed to it, and Kim's participating with me (w00t!).   I need to work on All-State music. That's coming up in 15 (14 tomorrow) days. Yikes! I may do that a bit tonight.   On a side note, I am mad at this: I have been trying to get 311 tickets for virtually 2 weeks now. While doing homework, I kept the phone right beside me when listening to 99X. I would so make up an excuse to take the History exam early if I could go to the 311 concert. But nooooooo! No 311 tickets for Fran no matter how hard she tries! Ughh!  All right, well, I leave you with a bow.  *Bows*   "No Pressure Over Cappuccino" by Alanis Morissette   And you're like a 90's Jesus And you revel in your psychosis  How dare you? And you sample concepts like hors d'euvres  And you eat their questions for dessert  Is it just me,or is it hot in here?   And you're like a 90's Kennedy And you're really a million years old  You cannot fool me They'll throw opinions like rocks in riots  And they'll stumble around like hypocrites  Is it just me or is it dark in here?   You may never be or have a husband You may never have or hold a child  You will learn to loose everything  We are temporary arrangements   And you're like a 90's Noah  And they laughed at you as you packed all of your things  And they wonder why you're frustrated  And they wonder why you're so angry  And is it just me or are you fed up?    And may God bless you in your travels  In your conquests and queries
