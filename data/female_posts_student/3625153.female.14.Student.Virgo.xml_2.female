Te quiero... One thought of you And the pain is diminished. Around everything A bright light, A feeling of hope. Te quiero... You leave And the pain lingers. There is no breeze, No light. And the darkness can consume my soul. Te quiero... Forever and ever. Do you love me? I can't be sure Even if you tell me. Te quiero... But you are a mystery to me.  ill post more poems later..
