I liked it but it's not one of my favorite cartoons. I liked  Shrek  better. I also liked  Iron Giant  better.  Atlantis  didn't move me as much as the other two animated films did.    Speaking of animation, the one that we are  really ,  really  looking forward to is  Final Fantasy . I really don't care how much of a story it's got.. I'd watch it even for just the animation !!  The previews look amazing !     Mom is coming over after work today. She's bringing Logan. I am really looking forward to this afternoon because we will play, play and play. Tonight, Brian and I will attend the weekly Swing Club gathering at WSU. Brian has really come a long way. He knows lots of different turns now. He even knows a lifting move !  Dancing is so much fun !!
