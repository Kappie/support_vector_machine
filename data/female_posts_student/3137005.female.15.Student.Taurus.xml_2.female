Enoch Powell.   Are you happy now Jess, see what you're making me do, what enoch says. I know that you are a big pile of phelgmmy grossness with sam, a dfigested dung beetle stuck in you, but there is no reason to drag me into your sick little games as well you evil little fiend of hell!!!!! Ahem, and now boys and girls the nasty lady wil stop saying disgusting things to her friends and get on with her blog. My mum is out so I have the entire house to myself, a fact that i am very proud about as this alows me the freedom of running around my house like a mad man singing into hairbrushes without the constant punctuation of the phrase, 'STOP IT YOU MAD BUGGER YOU'LL COME THROUGH THE ROOF!'. Not that i can actually run more hop! I think that I must be one of those artist people who is never really appreciated until they're gone, and then everyone decides that even if they were carzy, they were pretty cool, and they should of had the chance to be even more crazy. I love the romeo and juliet soundtrack, espeically track 7, which is my song of the day, and probably will be for a while. I think it may be my fav song again, since i've just spent the last hour with it on repeat.  Oh update on my poorly toe, that i fell down the stairs and hit by the way.  It is now roughly the size of a wotsit, and is turning a wierd shade of grey/purple, in a little ring all around it. Nothing special, i think i've broken it before anyway. Now that should be enough to satisfy, the evil slave drivng Jess Wylde who does not know the difference between A design brief and a problem, and won't tell me!!!! By the way if you do know please tell me.
