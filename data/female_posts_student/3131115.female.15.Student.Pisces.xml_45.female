I'm such a bitch..I'm so mean. :(  The other day, Ashley IMed me..and asked me if I needed someone to talk to. Sure enough...as soon as I was going to open up again..my computer froze and I couldn't do shit about it. Not only did it freeze, but when I tried restarting it..it wouldnt work, and by the time I got it working again she was already away. *sigh*...I feel bad because all this shit happens and then I feel like she doesn't believe me. Oh well..:-/.   I'm kind of pissed because a week before Christmas my mom ordered a POD shirt off the internet. They took the money from her account, but they never gave me the shirt. I was trying to tell my mom this morning to check her mail, to see if they sent anything about it..but her response was throwing her hands up and saying "I dont even care, that was a long time ago" but I do..I didnt get my damn shirt!   Bill and I decided that we're going to start to chill out more..and if "drugs" will make that happen..we'll try it out. Now..If we start..IF..We're not going to turn out big pot heads or anything..just once in a while to chill with eachother and stuff. Also, if we do start..Nobody will know. Everyone I know who does "drugs" wants everyone to think of that when they think of them..they want to be KNOWN as a pot head...but me, I dont care..nor do I want anyone knowing. I guess I've never actually been 'high' before..the shit I did with Zack was PCP..which just kills braincells and fucks with your brain, so I never really got a 'good' high..I got a shitty one that was probably twice as bad as anything 'normal'..Grr. I'm kind of proud to state that I finally (maybe) quit smoking cigarettes. I still get the urge to, but..I dont htink I'm going to give in. I have 4 left..but, I dont know..I dont really have the desire to smoke. I mean, I do..but I'm sick of sneaking around and shit...when I turn 18 I'll probably start and then I'll do it whenever the fuck I want. Anyhow..I dont want to talk about this shit anymore..it's already taken up too much space.  I'm sick of the excuses that you want me to believe I've been understanding giving everything you need Using me is over now and soon you're gunna see Im done with you..Im done with you  Will there be a difference if I follow what you say taken from my mind and I cant seem to get away using me is over now and soon you're gunna see Im done with you..Im done with you  Everyone is the same quick to point the blame all I know is that life is a struggle I cant seem to escape all the games that you play all i know is that life is a struggle -ADEMA-  That's to a sertain someone..but I dont want to get into that now. I will upset myself. I used to talk on Yahoo and shit..I loved going into chatrooms, and sometimes I miss the chatrooms but I dont miss the stupid guys. Once, I talked to this really cool guy..he was wicked cool, but..I dont like yahoo anymore. I dont like yahoo because guys always ask to see my cam, and I dont like people watching me. It bothers me..its bad enough looking in the mirror..but having OTHER people look at me? :( Just staring at me...It scares me. I'm really glad that nobody reads this. I kind of wish that it was a private journal so that if someone I know goes on here..they can't stumble accross it. I dont want people knowing whats going on in my life..well, besides *you*. This is the only way you'll ever really know how I'm feeling...because this is the only way or time that I put my feelings into words..or think about my feelings for that matter.  Anyway..I'm going to leave..too much post for one day.
