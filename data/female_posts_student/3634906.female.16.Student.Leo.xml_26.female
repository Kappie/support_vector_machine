And during all of this I have been doing my laundry because everything I own smells like cigarettes. I still have another load to do. Ick. And now I am on my own for a few hours. My brother is visiting Mariah in Door County and my parents and Dannylin are at karate. I'm at a loss of what to do with myself. I'm not feeling like being social and at the same time I dont feel like sitting here alone. I think I am going to go for a walk. I feel like a fatty, because I've been so lazy lately. So hopefully going for a walk will make me feel less lazy. We'll see.    My sister's due date got pushed back to August 22nd. Yikes 11 days longer than it should have been. But I think its better if she doesnt have her until then because she doesnt have to worry about having her at work. That would really suck, and to tell you the truth she isnt really even dropping yet so I think that she will probably have her near the 22nd. I dont know though, I obviously dont know anything about having kids. Thank God. But someday I am sure that I will. Not soon though.    Last night I was at a loss of what to do with myself so I decided to start reading Slaughthouse 5 again and also I started reading the bible. Weird I know but I would like to read it once through. I'm not really that religious but I mean I have been confirmed so maybe reading it is something I should do. We will see how long that last, by tomorrow I will never want to pick it up again.     Well I am going to go now. I am going to get dressed and fix my hair and then I'm going to go for my walk.    -gabby
