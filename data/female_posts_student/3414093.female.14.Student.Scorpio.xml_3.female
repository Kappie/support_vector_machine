And I am NOT going to see a movie with my mom.  haha, I tried to convince James to hop on a bus and come to Perth for the weekend but his parents are nazis and would slaughter him...but he really wants to and I really want him to.  Maybe he will come down next weekend...Jeffrey too!  haha, Camping: my mom wants to talk to Ursula (Bob's mom) to make sure she is aware of the camping trip and that there will be boys and girls alone in the woods.  She is worried we will have 'too much fun', meaning sex of course. I asked James if I should bring my tent and he said that i should just to make it look like we WON'T be sleeping together...of course we will be...but hey!  Anyways...Khala wants we to go to www.illwillpress.com so I'm off to check that out...bye!  XOXO
