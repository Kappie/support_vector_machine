Thought I would show all my adoring fans my killer tan line in the first photo. It's hot. Guess that's what I get for opting out of the nude beach though. And, if you're wondering, its all natural baby. No tanning salons for me. I promise. My family seriously spends just about every weekend at the lake. Nothing but natural-melanoma-causing UV rays for this gal. Mmm hmm.  Damn straight.   Anyway, watched John Kerry's nomination acceptance speech tonight. Suffice it to say that I was thoroughly impressed and captivated. He hit a home-run, as one of the news commentators aptly put it.  He'll make a great president, god willing he gets elected.  I won't be old enough to vote, so my fingers are crossed.   Have acquired strange obsession with making hemp bracelets and necklaces, bordering on compulsive behavior. Made probably 15-20 today.  I am wearing 8 as I type this.  Is that neurotic?   I wanted to say a quick hello to my newest online acquaintance, Sarah Beara, who may be the sole reader of this blog.  This may sound pitiful, but you made my day by posting a comment.  So, thanks in that regard.
