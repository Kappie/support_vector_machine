The idiot boy previously referred to. Is now back from Budapest and he has yet to contact me which means he is avoiding me. Which even though I know I shouldn't give him the time of day bother me! I'm trying my best no to think of him BUT ....A broken heart is hard to heal.  Next my school life is currently in upheaval. I mean I have tons to do but I am getting more and more afraid that what I am doing is not going to give me any result at al because the project was too big to start with and so the design is not strong! And What ticks me off is that me, who has little to no experience in the research world and has only lately been introduced to the world of spinal cord injury is the one who the fault for the project...If it doesn't work out...Going awry. But in reality it is because I was not very well guided and I was given a project that is too huge! How I am going to salvage this mess is beyond me. In the depths of my heart I know that somehow it will work out but the how and the when is starting to get me down.  Third I'm trying to decide if I should take the MCAT this august or wait until April. I only have two days left to decide and I just don't know what to do!  Fourth I'm SO thankful for the people in my life who support me. Those who do so by listening to my endless prattle and those like my adopted Grandpa who understand that I have BIG dreams but not the finances to support those dream and so he surprises me by buying me a wetsuit. Which by the way is SO totally awesome! I've just been putting it on and taking it off I can hardly wait for the weekend when I can take it out to a lake and try it out!! So excited.  Fifth there is something else going on in my life but due to the first thing I'm not really sure what to think or feel. So it leads to me being confused. Anyways enough prattle for now. I should get to work!
