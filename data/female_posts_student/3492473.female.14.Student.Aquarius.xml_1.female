Here I am just typing a post to you guys and watching some music videos and the damn computer freezes! So, there I am trying to somehow open the page and save this but I couldn't so I just restarted the thing... go figure . Do any of you ever feel like these types of things only happen to you? I look around @ all my friends and wonder why everything is (or just seems) so  great  with them  and not me ... Throughout the last few years,  a lot  has changed. Once again,  go figure . But when I say a lot has changed, I don't mean things like I've gotten taller and that stuff.  I mean mentally  a lot has changed. These days, it seems like I can hardly get through a day without bawling my eyes out, flipping out at a member of my family, or just being a bitch. I always ask myself why people consider me a "preppy bitch" but in a sense I can understand why people would ever say such things. I'll admit, I'm not the nicest but neither is the majority of my grade  so why should they be the ones to call me names  when I kept my mouth shut about them?  And I hate it how people tell you it doesn't matter what others think of you.  Because to me,  it does ! People have such an influence on the other people in their life that they hardly realize. I know many people who are bulemic and anerexic(spelling?)  because their friends call them fat . I know a few people who  cut  themselves because they feel like the pain they feel on the outside can be eliminated by the pain they inflict on themselves. I know people who drink their problems away and think they don't have a problem. I know people who smoke only because older siblings smoke so it automatically makes them  "cool."  Our world is so screwed up and  it seems like a waste of time just to image how I can make a difference.  Right now I feel so lazy. I should be working out, finishing my health test, or writing poetry. But here I am...being a complete computer geek and recording my thoughts on a website that probably only a few people will just "glance" at. Life is so sucky that sometimes it doesn't even seem worthwhile. Yesterday while I was at Annie's, we got to talking about how we'd kill ourselves if we ever decided we were going to. I can't even remember how we started talking about it. The fact that we were is just a little scary. I mean everyone has suicidal thoughts a few times in their life, am I right?  I mean, I'll admit it. I have thought a few times that  death would be a lot better than living.  But luckily, I have some really good friends who remind me that it wouldn't be. Ya know something else I hate? How adults think being a teen is  so easy ... BULL SHIT! I don't know how it was for them but now it's a lot different.  If you're at a party and people are smoking and you don't, you're a loser.  That's what I hate about this culture, you can't make your own choices without being so heavily judged. And I mean, why would teens wanna do things such as smoking or drugs? If they really think it'll solve some problems in their life, they really need to go see a therapist or someone who'll help them. Ah...I think I'm gonna save this one and start another...
