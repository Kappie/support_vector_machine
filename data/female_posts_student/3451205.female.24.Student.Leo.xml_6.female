Had to do a presentation on blogs at school a few days ago and realized blogging is actually a cool thing to do.. so here I am..  you want a short description of myself? well, crazy, openminded, thinking too much about too many things, and with a pretty dark sense of humor. but sometimes I can't even help laughing about movies like, I dunno, The Naked Gun or some pretty silly stuff like this..  hm.. I'm not that good at characterizing myself.. so, why don't you see for yourself?  Enjoy your stay!
