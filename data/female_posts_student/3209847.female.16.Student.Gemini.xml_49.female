"rational and irrational behavior: who's to say?"  that was my second choice so woot!  and i know the names and email addresses of the other 14 kids in my seminar and two of them i've already gotten in contact with, so double woot!  i already have friends!  or people i know at least.  and my freshman advisor emailed me too.  she's premed psychology, which is exactly what i'm thinking of doing, which rocks.  she sounds awesome.  i'm getting really excited about school.  whoa.  that's a new feeling.  lol.  okay i had to tell somebody and everyone's asleep so here it is.    bye
