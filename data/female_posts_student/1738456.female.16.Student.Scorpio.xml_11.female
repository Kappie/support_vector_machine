The doors were all the same, and I had no way of knowing which door was the one I was supposed to open. I walked to the center and suddenly felt like I was falling. I reached out and grabbed at the air to steady myself.  Looking up at the doors, I decided that I would eventually have to go through one. But I would have to decide which first. I counted from the door in front of me to the third one and walked up. I leaned in to peek into the hole.  “Not that one!” The voices kept coming out of the air in this place.  “Why not?” I challenged.  “Well you see three is always a bad number. If you go for that one, you’re walking into certain death.”  “Oh really, and you wish to keep me from dying?” I twisted around trying to find the voice.  “Well to put it simply, yes.”  “Where are you?” I didn’t like being watched; I always had that feeling here. A mouse scurried across my foot, and I jumped. The hands on the grandfather clock to my right whirled faster than my head. I walked to the door across from the one I where I was. I peeked in the peephole, and I saw a mirror on the other side.  “Can I go in this one?” I asked the room.  “If you want,” I felt the room shrug.  “I won’t die if I go in this one will I?” I put my hand on the knob, and waited for the answer.  “There’s always a chance of dying, but I don’t think you will in there.”  “Thank you,” I called out and walked inside the door.   There was a full-length mirror in front of me. I stood staring a moment at my face, and then I put the mask on. I smiled at the hidden face in front of me. I turned around, and the door was gone. I had no way of getting back into the talking room, so I decided to see what was behind the mirror. I didn’t get the chance. The room tilted, and I slid quickly down into a hole in the floor. A long, blue, and loopy slide lay before me. I couldn’t stop myself at all. I screamed.  Suddenly I was aware that I was shooting past stars and planets in this long black tunnel. I stopped screaming, and reached my arm out. A handful of stardust came off onto my hands, and I poured it onto my head, laughing. The stars began shooting by me slower, and I saw a light below me. I tried to stop myself with my feet. It was too late; I crashed, with a thud, into a matching pair of large, oak double doors.  Standing up, I dusted myself off, and checked for any rips. There were none, nor did I have any bruises. I adjusted my mask, and reached out for the door handle. The doors both swung open at my touch.
