Kim was disturbed by the movie, I think - eroticism and cruelty may be an effective combination, but also pretty discomforting.  Braveheart was good, but I liked Rob Roy better.  Probably because Liam Neeson is just so awesome.  I'm not familiar with "The Restoration", and am more familiar with Downey's tabloid escapades than his movie work, though he did a brilliant portrayal of my brother-in-law's umfriend, or someone just like him, in "Home for the Holidays" (one of MY favorites).  Other cool period pieces: Fellini's Casanova, The Lion in Winter, A Man for All Seasons, King of Hearts, History of the World Part I...  Daf
