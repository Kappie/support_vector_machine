He seems to be doing well, still in the greater DC area.  I think he's just waiting for me to come up there and hang out.  :)  Work is going to be hellish this week.  Jason is on vacation in Switzerland (must be nice) and expects me to do his job (shut up Ryan) as well as mine while he is gone.  Considering my job is really the work of like 3 people, I hope he enjoys his vacation while it lasts becuase he's going to be playing catch up for many moons to come.    Gator is this weekend and I'm looking forward to it and dreading it at the same time.  It will be nice to give Bruce a glimpse into that scary wonderland that was my life in college, however, I'm not looking forward to seeing a few of the people that come along with the tournament.  It's going to be depressingly reminiscent of my freshman year, with recent events and whatnot.  But perhaps, as Susan suggested, it will bring the team together and maybe give Kellie a little relief from the bitching and moaning for once.  Well, I'm off to bed.  Us old people go to bed early or stay up all night eating cookies.  Considering the clean-the-car wager Bruce and I have going, I'm going to hit the sack while I have the possibility of not having gained weight today on my side.  That and Zoe is giving me the "Sleepytime" face.  Toodles!!
