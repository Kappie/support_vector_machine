"cool" i kinda miss her.  saw "ladykillers" what a pile of shite.  maybe it was cause i was distracted by the young couple who were sitting diagonally from me, with the boy was fingering the girl and pulling constantly.  fucks sake.  learn manners!  left sophie's present off with leo.  and i started making tracks towards home.  dropped over at the internet cafe outside south ken station, and whilst i sipped on the hot chocolate, miss badger caught my eye, posting what looked like student reports, through the letter box. she was in her jeans and trainers. something about her, that makes me sad. she is a nice, kind, generous, sweet person... i dunno.... just always looks so sad.  we love you miss badger.  plus andrew rory and jonathan are complete simpletons.  sorry, am i just re-iterating something we already know?  xxk
