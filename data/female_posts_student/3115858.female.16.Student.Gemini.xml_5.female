(aftermath-ish thingy.)  i'm wearing the same shirt that out-of-town boy wore on friday.  and the only other person i know who has this shirt wore it today too.  (it's a radiohead shirt.)  i think this and my dreams are signs of what will happen to me in the near future.  i don't like it.  (i don't know what the latter signifies, but maybe it's an opposite of personality or something like that.)  :/  i think i'm going to quit music, too.  at least after i'm finished with high school.  i might keep my guitar around, but as for french horn, i think graduation is it.  when will i use it after that?  there is no way in hell that i would be able to make it in the world as a horn player.  i'm not very good at it, and it's good that i'm realizing it so that i can spend my time on other things.  i have no desire to continue my education on french horn.  i'm not capable of much else on that, as far as i can see.  you might call it "giving up."  i call it prioritizing.  for once. it's what my parents have always wanted me to do.  i hope they're happy.  they're the only people (between the three of us) that get anything close to what they want.  i'm struggling to survive.  literally.  i'm being strangled.
