Jenn and Matt and I walked the Freedom Trail, or as far as we wished to go...we made it all the way across the river to Charlestown and then gave up and took the T home. I don't understand this weather: two days ago it was raining and I was more than comfortable in pants and a long-sleeved shirt. Today, I just want to hop in the shower. I will, after this.  Damnit, one of my roommates just got in the shower.  I guess this tour is just one of those things you have to do when you're in Boston. It took us five weeks to get around to it, and even so, we didn't cover the whole thing. It's funny...by the time we got across the river, we didn't really see anyone else. We snapped faraway pictures of the Bunker Hill Memorial and the USS Constitution and desperately decided to find the next T stop.  But yeah. I'm just really, really hot and sweaty. Ew.  Tomorrow's going to be August.  Wow.
