We both had our problems and we both talked to each other about it. She made me realize a lot of things that I knew but ran away from. I was in denial... and I know it. I don't know what to do now. I have two choices and either way somebody's gonna get hurt. Myself or him. I've sheltered him from most of the hurt already and I'm at the point where I can't stand to take more of the hurt and troubles. I don't think I can shelter him any longer. I can either bear the pain myself and jeopardize the chance of letting it "all fall down" or I can stop sheltering him and let reality hit him. I don't know. I'm getting really tired of this. I'm sick, and I'm tired. If I take any more of this, I'm gonna blow. I mean it. Is all this really worth it or not? So many things I don't know... so many things I haven't seen.   KFD (got the codename from PFF) was real. That I know for sure. Itm wasn't real in the beginning (real in another sense) but eventually became more than real. I realized that. But I couldn't let it go on.   I don't know if RD is real or not. I want to know. Either I get hurt in the truth or I hurt itm. I don't know. I'll see... Gotta go. Sister wants computer. I'll blog later if I can... or if I want. Don't know.   I'm glad I went outside with Moca... maybe it'd have been better in than if I went outside with Nima in the sense that I learned something and I got advice on my issues. Dunno.
