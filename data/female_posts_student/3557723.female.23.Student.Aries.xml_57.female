I'm not risking my fiancee having a look before the wedding. My best friend and I put our heads together and put ideas together resulting in the dress. Thank you chickie babe! I could not have done it without you.  We went to three bridal stores yesterday. Now, we did have an idea of what to expect. It was a Saturday. We hadn't made any appointments, but these stores do not require appointments. You would think staff would be happy to help and appear to be friendly. In two of the stores, the staff either ignored us, were unhelpful or downright rude, and one particular staff member managed to do all three!   urlLink Cupid's Bridal  was our first stop. This is the only store that I can reccommend. It was extremely busy in this store so it was quite understandable that no one approached us instantly and we were quite happy to look around. Despite being busy, staff members who were serving other bride-to-be's found time to say hello and to offer assistance when their customers were in the changing rooms.   urlLink Cupid's Bridal  does Made-to-Measure. They're open to all sorts of ideas, colour, cut, style, theme because they make the dresses. Fantastic to any bride-to-be who wants a personalised dress. I will be approaching this store to see if my dress can be made by them including dressmakers. We were even allowed to look at embroidery samples and encouraged to take them and to hold them against dresses around the store.  In HobNob, we did encounter one helpful and friendly staff member. Unfortunately, she was assisting with a bride-to-be. She was also open to ideas though the oriental factor did throw her a little. I do admit, it's not easy to find what I want. But she was able to show me a dress that had been done in red even though it wasn't a blending of cultures. We then went to walk around browsing.  It was here that we encountered the staff member that manage to ignore us. We approached her when I found a dress that caught my eye. I was told that it was not available in red and in the same beath, she said that she wasn't sure. It would be fair that she checked though isn't it? When it was made clear that I wanted a red dress and I wasn't compromising, only then did she check with another staff member.   And then when she came back to tell me that it was definitely not available in red, she proceeded to tell me that there were lots of shades of red, she could only name two, pillar box red and burgandy. Like I didn't know. I am the one looking for a red dress, and hello, I'm Chinese for crying out loud. We love red!  If that was not enough, she started to ask how much I was willing to spend. I replied that I was collecting quotes to see how much I had to spend on what I wanted. Then she cut me off by saying that dresses were around the $2,000 mark. Nevermind that I want something that she obviously couldn't cater for or that I wanted something that wasn't the norm. The only way that I could possibly fathom a budget would be collecting quotes on what I liked and then adding the cost of additions needed.  Unfortunately or fortunately, we did see a blue dress in the store above HobNob that had the perfect cut. Wrong colour but they can do it in red. I'll be checking whether they have any ties to HobNob before I spend a cent. I do not want any of my money going into HobNob's purse.  The third store isn't even worth mentioning. They were utterly useless. They didn't do Made-to-Measure. I don't hold this against them. However, the staff were unhelpful and talked down to me as if I didn't belong in there. I can't remember the name of the store at this stage.
