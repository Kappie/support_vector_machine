They have regressed to helpless baby-talk, and any attempt to have a serious conversation is interspersed by cries of 'awwww - you want to play with my toe?' and 'there she goes again - zoom.'  Hopefully I'll have a couple of good pictures to post later on. At the moment, Nixie hasn't managed to stay in one place for long enough for my parents to get a good picture of her.
