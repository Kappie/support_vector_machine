But the nice thing is that my first class is at nine (Introductory German . . .yes, the drugs I'm on *are* nice, since you asked. ^_^) and my last one ends at two thirty.  So, not bad at all.  I'm taking an English, a "conceptual" science class (Hyper, I got the English accent guy!), ummm . . .something on the American Revolution, and Intermediate Yoga.  I was going to take Beginning Yoga, for fairly obvious reasons, but it was all full so I'm taking intermediate.  How good are people in intermediate yoga?  I'm kinda worried now.  *frowns*  Is this class at the point where I'm supposed to have found inner peace - or even a sense of balance, cause I haven't done that yet!  I leave for the UK in almost exactly a week - I'm entirely freaked out.  And I'm going to miss all of you guys like crazy.  No, more than crazy.  Heck, orientation was too long away from you strange and fascinating people, how am I going to survive almost two months, and then school???  Oh, right, and about *school*.  There were over six hundred kids at the orientation, right?  I saw Eve, right?  These people were too white and preppy for Eve.  She called them "jappy," which they were, but without the jewish, really.  All the girls wore the short summer skirts and tank tops with the long Jennifer Aniston hair and were all flirting with the guys - all of whom had on striped polo shirts, khaki shorts or pants, and backwards beat up baseball caps.  I'm going to *school* with these freakishly normal upper middle class Americans!  *screams*  And they're all going to be accountants or lawyers and I swear the only good thing to come out of this had better be a white guy for Hyper . . .and anyone else who might want one.  C'mon Zenman, I know you do. ^_~  I guess that panic attack is all for right now - oh, but right, I have a cell phone!  It's for emergencies or something, and my aunt won't tell me the minute plan so I'm really afraid to use it except for after nine pm and before midnight, but still, it's weird.  Probably only keep it this summer.  Still weird.  It's some GSM plan or something.  All right, I'm rambling . .off to bed.  G'night!
