I know I need to sleep, I've had like 8 hrs total in the past 3 days, and I just realize I have dark circles under my eyes. ahhhh....I seriously have way too much on my mind. My aunt, my grades, and David. Which thinking about him really helps me, I just wish I could talk to him :(. So I guess I just need to stop stressing, deal with it, and go to sleep. I hate it when I get in these moods. Like right now, I seriously have an erge to do something, that I have promised I'd never do again, but I can't help it. It's nawing at me, it's what I do to relieve stress and other emotional crap. And no it has nothing to do with drugs/alcohol/sex, it's more...ahhh I can't explain it. Only Rhonda knows what I'm talking about, she can relate. Sometimes I feel like getting into bed and just never waking up, but then I'd miss out on life and in life to get to the happy stuff you must get through all the bad...so I'm not just going to give up. All I want is David, but he's not here...I know that if I was in his arms, nothing could hurt me, his strength and love would be enough...:::sigh:::   hold on to me love you know I can't stay long all I wanted to say was i love you and I'm not afraid
