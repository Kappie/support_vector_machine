Often the reason that people say they can't do something is that they've tried things in the past that haven't worked. But remember - and I've used this phrase again and again throughout my life.   Your past does not equal your future.     What matters is not yesterday but what you do right now. So many people are trying to drive into the future using a rearview mirror to guide themselves! If you do that, you'll crash. Instead you must focus on what you can do today to make things better.  If you look at any of the most successful people in history, you will find this common thread: They would not be denied. They would not accept no. They would not allow anything to stop them from making their vision, their goal, a reality.   No problem is permanent.   urlLink   No problem affects my entire life.   urlLink   This, too, shall pass if I continue to take massive, positive, constructive action.   My message to you is simple, and in your heart you know it's true: Massive, consistent action with pure persistence and a sense of flexibility in pursuing your goals will ultimately give you what you want, but you must abandon any sense that there is no solution. You must focus immediately on the actions you can take today, even if they are small ones.
