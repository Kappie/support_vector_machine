I know.... sitting in front of an electronic device having to press little black buttons in a particular sequence to convey a message may only SEEM easy to some...but to the vast and growing majority of the American people that would rather sit on the couch and watch an infommercial instead of getting up and finding the remote.....or (god forbid) actually change the channel manually....the whole having to come up with a logical and coherant entry has proven more difficult.  I just made that whole last paragraph one sentence. One big, long, run-on sentence.   I have had a semi-interesting week.   1.) Signed up for golf team.  2.) Cheer pictures. 3.) Discussion Speech. 4.) Worked the fish fry with Marissa. 5.) Subsaquently messed the crap out of Marissa's blog. 6.) Wasted a whole Saturday night cheering for Shores at Grand Haven with only three other cheerleaders because the rest of the squad didn't show up.  The fish fry was fun....except for the old people. For an explanation, I can only urge you to view Marissa's blog.  Ah well....  Its 1:24pm and I am going to go take a shower now.  Aren't the weekends just WONDERFUL????
