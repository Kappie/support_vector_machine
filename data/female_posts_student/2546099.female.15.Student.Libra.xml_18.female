Wait i remember. In about 4 weeks i will have 2 make 1 of the hardest descisions of my life.

Neway i cant be bothered writing about it so ill see wat happens.. i dont want 2 stop dancing it is my life, it has been there through failed friendships, fights, boyfriends and everyhting, the 1 thing that has made me happy 4  5 years.
