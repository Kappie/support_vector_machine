Or maybe its a government conspiracy behind it. Hmmm.  Remember that rebate check we got from GWB?  Yeah, thats it, thats where my tax refund went to!  Waaaaah!  I wish I was back in College when I could be claimed by my parents and I could get a better tax refund. (And then?)  And then I could have more money for parties (And then?) And then I could go to buy more beer and get wasted drunk (And then?)  Dude, youre thats starting to get annoying.  (And then?)     (_)_) Net    Last Look at the lights @ Ground Zero....
