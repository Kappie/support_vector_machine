In addition, we were completely fooled by Lauren's "love" for Vaughn when she set him free.  I can't believe that I was deceived by her; she is better at being double-faced than Irena ever was.    The one problem I had with this episode tonight was that no one informed Syd of Vaughn's kidnapping.  I was waiting for her to come and save the day, but she didn't.  I think it would have added to the plotline if she had to choose between saving Vaughn or her sister.  How all of the sudden did she wind up at the hospital at Vaughn's side?  I think that was too big of a gap to leave--I mean, no one even told her about him.  The previews for next week were ambiguous.  She was fighting with two other women--I don't know.  Until next week, I remain on the edge of my seat!
