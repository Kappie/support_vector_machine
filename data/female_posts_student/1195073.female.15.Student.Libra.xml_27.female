Well, some people's behavior at the dance and the book 'The Catcher in the Rye' got me thinking.  I have come to a conclusion: I know a lot of phonies.  You know the type.  The one's who are sooo nice to your face and talk crap behind your back, or they do that to somebody else.  I was like that, but I got sick of it.  And yes, I'm writing this for a reason.  UGH!!!!  I am soooo pissed off right now!!!  And here's what I'll do: I'll confront the person who I'm talking about (there are a lot of phonies, especially in Language Arts, where I counted 13 in our class) and tell this person what I think about what they're doing, and then, we'll get into an argument, and then, we'll make up and be friends again.  Our friendship is a big gamble, yes, but this person is really pissing me off!!  And the funny thing is that when I grow up, I want to be a politician or an actress!!  I want to go into the fakest industries/professions there are!!!!  Oh well, I will keep it real!!!!  I will update you tomorrow and tell you what happened with the person who is making me mad!!!
