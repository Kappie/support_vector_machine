Don't be too harsh on Michael.  It ended well.  At first it didn't, when I hung up on him, but then I IMed him, and things kind of straightened out a bit.  I'm much better now.  Done moping.  I finally got my 35 cards done in study hall, while the bell was ringing.  Anyway, I better keep going on this research project.  The more I read about Lennon, the more I love him.  I'm even starting to like Yoko, or at least understand the principle behind why he loved her.  I was flipping through stations while my mom was in the hospital and on the History channel was this documentary about famous murders, and that day it just happened to be Lennon, so I watched it. When I finished watching, I think I had gone through a box of tissues.  I never knew that I'd be that emotional about something that happened 23 years ago...hmmm...it's going to be hard to write about.
