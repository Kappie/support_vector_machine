I decided not to try out for the UIL competition of Macbeth. It's just that all the freaking varsity, senior people are going to get all the good parts and if I did make it, I'd get one of  those freaking no line parts where I am just sorta onstage randomly, I mean come on! I've had like one freaking lead role, I can handle it, but no I guess the turtle bitch Ms. Welch doesn't think so. Oh well, one day I'll prove it to them how good of an actress I am, especially when I have my oscar in one arm, haha beat that! Plus, I hate do Shakespeare =p!   Dude last night I got like so freaked out. I was literally burning up, I had to turn on the fan and kick off all the covers and stuff. I guess it was because of getting that pierced. Plus, I was kinda worried since I've heard it can cause hearing loss or paralysis, so yeah, it's all good now, I'm sure everything is fine. I know if I had one thing last night, it wouldn't have been so bad, everything would of been good and I wouldn't have freaked, because when I'm in David's arms I feel so safe that nothing can happen...   When you smile I can feel All my passion unfolding Your hand brushes mine And a thousand sensations
