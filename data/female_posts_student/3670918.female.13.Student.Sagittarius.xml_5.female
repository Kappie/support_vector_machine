My sister, Amy, Jaime ane I walked over to a baseball game to see if someone yes a boy was playing. But he wasn't. After that my sister was the first person to play and she sounded soooooooooooooooo good that everyone was talking about her. Then this other grouped played then two girls sang one of them sounded really good and the other one sounded really bad I mean really bad. Then a couple more groups played. My sister got really mad because they told her that she could only play a couple songs and everyone got to play for 25 minutes so she went out to the car then I fallowed her and I got her in a better mood of course. Then when we got back they were voting of who should win. O yeah and there was this really really hot guy that came and was taking notes. My sister and I were total in love with him. After everyone was done voting they started to tally them up. There was 5 prizes two free pizzas, two gigs out side of rockys and the really big one a 4 hour recording session. They started to hand out the prizes and the first two prizes went to the two girls who sang witch was the free pizzas and the next two prizes went to the two bands and that was two gigs at rockys. My sister got so mad and she was like there is only one more prize left. And they said the 4 hour recording session goes to Stephanie keesler my sister literally started shaking so bad and she was crying my MOM ran out having a fit like she won. All my family was crying so bad including me. After that we went out to eat at ponderosa it was yummy. By the time we got home it was almost 10:30. Well that's the end goodbye.
