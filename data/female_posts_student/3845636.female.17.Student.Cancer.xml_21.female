Going through thick and thin with us and being the head of the family. I'm glad to say I have such a wonderful him around. Although domestic conflicts do occur all the time... and I would say that it is like a daily affair... but through these misunderstandings and disagreements, we have got to know each other better. Do not think that within your own kins... you do not need to make the special effort to understand them better... actually the truth is that they are probably the ones whom we have always been taking for granted and we may tend to neglect them subconsciously. Sometimes he makes me cry... but I know the reason why. That's not a need for him to say much when he is annoyed or unhappy with me. A few words... a little change in his facial expression will send the message clearly right to the bottom of my heart. I realise how important my dad is to me...   He was there to guide me along and I can proudly say that I'm glad to be from the Leong Family. I really do not know how long all this time and precious moments will last (not as though I'm trying to be pessismistic)... the fact is, life is definitely unpredictable. We do not know what will happen next. Only someone of a higher power up there have things planned for us... what we can do, is to try to comprehend them and to deal it with the best of our ability. My dad just told me something today... which I felt truly touched... he said" Let me fetch you when it's late... I do not know how much longer I can do so."   Of course upon hearing this... I said all those stuff like 'touch wood!' and all. He tried to rectify his statement by saying that he may be going overseas soon... but anyway the point here is, whether I misinterpretated his remark or not... what he said had really struck something in my mind. Guess it's time I really learn to spend more quality time with them... and to manage time better so that I will have enough to spent with my studies and my love ones (family and friends...and all).   Although we don't say it often but as long as you sincerely use your heart to listen... you can definitely feel the love those dear ones around you are showering you with. There are times we feel very insecure... very uncomfortable... very lonely... but as these fears accumulate in us... it will gradually subside because we know that there's someone always there for u to give u the moral support! yup... had the sudden inspiration to write all these after hearing what my dad told me. yeah! He is my role model... and I try to remember the precious advices he gives me each time... hopefully things will continue to sail smoothly... =P Hee~
