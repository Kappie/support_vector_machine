Other pictures that we took had orbs in them but this was one of the scariest ones. I know taking pictures at a cemetery is creepy and demented. Sadly, that's one of the most exciting things I've done this summer. HA! I wasn't actually there when this picture was taken either, because I was too afraid, my best friend took this.   urlLink
