Anyway, today i sailed olly's new boat again, and it was at the same time, the most enjoyable and the most terrifying experience of my life. It is also the quickest i have ever been in a boat. My hands now hurt. RE revision will commence shortly, if anyone wants to watch. I am listening to dire straits.
