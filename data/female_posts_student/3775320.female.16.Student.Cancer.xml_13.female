       
      Sometimes when I see other people having fun, people my age, who I 'know', I feel like a kid.  They're all so mature, and I'm just someone who ... I dunno.  I just feel like a little girl.  And like I'd never fit in my own age group.  I missed something halfway. I know it, and it's because I moved.  I wish my life was just straightforward.  'Cause this has made me hang in the middle for so long that I've totally missed the opportunity to really grow.  I missed my growth spurt both physically and emotionally.  I'm 'short' in more ways than one.  And I can't catch up.
