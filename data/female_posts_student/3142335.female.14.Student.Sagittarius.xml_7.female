We saw Shrek 2!!! Well, when we first get there my mom is kinda skeptical about leaving me with Austin b/c she just met him like last night and then so she made us sit there until we saw someone and she was askin him alll these questions and then out of the blue "So what do you want to be when you grow up??" He like busts out laughing! It was hilarious I was like please make her leave!!! So then she was like well I'm bored ya'll go on, I'm goin to Wal-Mart.. So then I was like I am SO sorry about that..He just laughed about it. It's kinda funny but I don't knwo I was thinkin the whole time he is never going to want to go somewhere with me again!! Aha we had fun in the movie..I was sittin there and he looked back and then was writing a text message so I'm thinkin hey he saw some people and he was gunna send it to them well her hands me the phone and told me to turn around so I did and there's these 2 people like ALLLL over each other I mean it was gross! but hey obviously they couldn't o it anywhere else so we let them be.....wel, then the movie ends and he saw some friends of his and was like uh oh Austin's on a date with a "hot little white chik" I was liek we aren't dating he goes oh you gotta friend? I was like uhhh no? then we jsut walked over to applebee's and ate and had more fun it was great except these people lied and said they were us so they got our table!! kinda funny in a way but hey guess they were really hungry ..who cares aha we had fun then I came home and he went to another movie with those guys so we had fun it was a blast! Look forward to more outings with Cato! It was great! He's a great guy he's hilarious! Gotta love him!! ok well bye!!
