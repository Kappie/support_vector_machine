Way to stereotype - and be really nosy. If you think we're so bored, then what about yourself? Do you have nothing better to do than read journals of people you never have met and then condemn them? You can't judge a person by what they write when they're ranting or what they figure no one will really read anyway. Forget it - I don't know why I'm wasting my time even writing about you. Go get your own life.  Gee,  that was kind of mean of me... Anyway, it was a pretty normal day... Good Luck to Jenifur in her lacross game!! Yeah GL!
