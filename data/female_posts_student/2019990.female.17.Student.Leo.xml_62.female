I'm so glad I'm leaving, and don't have to deal with the completion.  Yey!  Next year however I will.     So 20 hours and counting until I leave for a month.  Augh! there's so much to do, and so little time.  And one more time. Augh!  okay, I feel better. Oh wait, I"m still on the computer and haven't accomplished anything.     I have so much to do though, I'll try to write later, but I have to go to a reception now for a friend who's going back to Germany ( she was an exchange student) see you all later.
