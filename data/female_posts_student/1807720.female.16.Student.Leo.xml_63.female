I finished my CALM stuff today and did my Chem homework.  I finished some of my religion but I am going to have to go early Tuesday to finish my Religion stuff cause I brought home the wrong religion book.  I got distracted by Travis yesterday cause after school he just showed up at my locker.  And well it kinda creeped me out though cause I was like "I thought you didn't know where my locker is" and he was like "Oh I was following you."  Like ok that kind of creeps me out when someone is following me and well since I have Chem when he had Science he was following me again on the same day.  And well I would have finished more Religion if I wasn't dumb and brought home the wrong book but I guess it happens and I will just have to live with that fact.  Tommorow is going to be ALL math.  I set aside ALL of my Sunday just to focus on my math.  I need to figure out what I am doing and PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE.  That is all I can really do at the moment and try to understand it cause this unit is REALLY CONFUSING and yeah FRUSTRATING and just about everything else.  All I did today was eat mounds of food like seriously tommorow I am going to have to majorly cut back because well I don't want to gain any weight but everything I thought about how much I don't understand and how I dread the math test I just kept eating the cookies and chocolate.
