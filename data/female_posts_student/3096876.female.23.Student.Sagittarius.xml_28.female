May 25?  Yeah, regular semester ended April 7.  Mom and Dad have already started in on the "so when are you moving out?" bullshite.  I really don't want to deal with this right now.  I'm finishing out at least the summer at my current job.  After that, everything is still up in the air.  Maybe I'll work through September, make some serious cash, then go for a little trip.  Maybe I'll start a new job in September (one that won't force this Hons. B.A. to stuff friggin' envelopes.  Yikes, that sounded snobby.  I recalled with "fondness" the last time my boss called me into her office.  She said she had a special project for me, because she felt that they hadn't tapped into the full resource of my creativity.  Yup, she had me design invitations for a stupid motivational exercise, then "carry it out" by bitching at people for not participating.  Faak.  Yeah, I really felt creatively exhausted after that.

Is this a project for my creativity, or a make-busy project?  So fear not Mona, you will not need to  force  me to quit or get me fired, I'm sure I will do so all on my own.  I issue this challenge to you, however: if YOU are still working there in a year, (heck, after Christmas?) I'm gonna find a way to get you fired.  Yeah, that sounds just about right.  Had to go to the hospital for a pre-op appt today.  At the bus-station coming home I bumped into a kid I went to highschool with.  He looked just the same as ever, talked. acted just the same.  It was an interesting introspective moment that followed (aren't they all?) because I wondered,  am I the same too?   I'll try to commit to a more detailed post when I get home today, lots of stuff to talk about -- a date, my trip, what I've been doing all day, etc.  You know, what ev.
