Last 2 days,I had just gone to a hall for FOMAD(Festival Of Drama  Music).On the way going to the Spastic hall,i get a really good nagging from my dad.Soon,i saw Shan Lei coming towards me.SHe seem moody about the way she going to chruch.Then Chui Wei came and we had gone approached her.Shan Lei is just so shy.Then we went to the counter and I saw Yean Ruey sitting there and hand me the CD that I had wished to borrow.Having a simple chat,we get a hand band from Abel and go into the hall. In the hall ,I just being so attracted to a girl that wear red band.So cool...She's the 3rd person I had being attracted too.Shan Lei and I enjoying ourselves playing the digital camera.We had took few photos.Soo,Dharine and Farha come and join us.Silence again....Shan Lei and I decides to walk bout.Then Yean Ruey introduced my net fren to me Sin Cheng Yeong,hotdog stall's boss.haha... Shan Lei and I back to our seats and Weetat the gang came.Weetat and Yean Ruey jus came beside me and start to sabo each other like kids.So funny..I just couldn't stop laughing for that.Nazalea also meet her partner,a boy from EC(cool hair). Then I borrowed Kenneth my camera,but in the end,he only took 2 useless pic and let the battery ends.Shit lar..I should take more picture be4 hand the camera to him.Sigh... The beginning part of the show is quite interesting.A special intoduction by Li Jie and his singing band is just great.Then drama,singing and....CONVENT DANCE!The girl that attracted me was on the stage and their dance is great.Soon,the show become lame.Shan Lei and I decides to buy something to eat.There got sell sandwiches,hot dog,ice cream,burger and drinks.SO little than I thought.But still I didn't buy the hot dog as ONE of my fren said is not very nice.hehe...But Shan Lei still got eat a hotdog with no bread and I went to buy a chicken burger.Then Shu Pei came to me  and we have a little chat. I not really remember what happened next.But nvm,hehe.Shan Lei and I back to the hall and watch a really stupid(funny?) drama of 'The Pearl'.Then Mark joined us after the drama.He said Shan Lei looked like Chui wei(Weetat said b4 too).hehe...Then cause got a irritating person sit beside me,I quickly went to find Yean Ruey for a chat.But....we just good friends since primary school,and he has girlfriend liao,the other people thought we what what pula.Futhermore still took picture...At first I teasing Yean ruey cause none of my business actually,but then I start to think will his girlfriend come and find me and giveme a slap?Hope not...I and Yean Ruey just a very good friend. Then Shan Lei,go to church with Chui wei and her gang,hehe..She seem enjoy her day. I was so lonely and I phoned my sis to pick me up earlier.After had a short chat with Mark,Yean Ruey,Bryan and Weetat,I went to the main gate to wait for my sister.Weetat and bryan came and acompany me(make fun of me i guess?).Almost after half an hour,my sister came in her boyfriend car.I bid Weetat and Bryan goodbye and went straight back home. I quite enjoy my day as I met many of my friend.Opps forget to say about wei-xun.He had become taller than me......sigh.....
