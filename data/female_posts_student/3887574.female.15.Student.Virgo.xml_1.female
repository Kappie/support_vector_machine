I was pleasently suprised to see that "I Love The 90's" came on TODAY and not TOMMOROW, so I got to see Dom early. He was dancing, it was damn funny, LOL.  Gah, don't do it Superman! He's at War World and has to fight Mongol and has to lose BADLY to him. J'onn is all weak and Hawk Girl  Green Lantern are looking for Superman now. I'd just like to say that The Flash is the best Justice League hero ever. LOL. The best superhero of ALL is of course Spiderman. Eww, Spiderman Unlimited is horrid. He has a FUCKING CAPE, ok? The hell, that's the GREATNESS of Spiderman, he doesn't have a cape like conventional superheroes. He's not like most superheros: he's a teenager with actual life problems. What other hero do you know like that? Not very many, 'cause Spiderman is different! Stan Lee didn't have anything to do with Spiderman UL, so it was just some lameass attempt at creativity. Looking pretty dumb, I'd say. LOL, I love superheros. :)  I need to diet. LOL  Man, it's really hot here. Kinda annoying. Ah, I forgot to link that wallpaper. LOL, I'll do it. Eventually. LOL. My cat is being odd. Haha, ok I think I'm done for now. Later.
