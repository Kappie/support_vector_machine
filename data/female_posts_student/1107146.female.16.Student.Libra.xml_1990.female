But that wouldn't be so great since that would require dying, and I don't think I'd like it so much. It would be violating the "no suicide rule" with Abby, probably. And anyway, I'm supposed to save my death for the end of a heroin syringe at 25 (craaaazy ever-changing number that it is!) y.o.  Wow, I must be tired or something. I never talk this much.  And don't quote me on that, you lot.
