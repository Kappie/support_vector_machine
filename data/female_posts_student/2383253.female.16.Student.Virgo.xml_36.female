I applaud Leela for her efforts, and most of the people we met there were nice and cool to talk to, but the youngins there were getting on my nerves. So were the slutty girls that were putting out in front of the Persians. Met some pretty nice people, and I appreciated the marshmallows and the hookah (which was green apple flavored, not orange, Matt). Gotta try that stuff more often. Oooh! And they said I could pass for a Persian girl! How's that for being ethnic, EH, MATT?!?!  Well today, I've been bored stiff again...watching stupid MTV bullshit reruns and putting off getting dressed and out of my PJs. I think I'll go do that and decide how to make the most of this Wednesday afternoon, evening, and night.
