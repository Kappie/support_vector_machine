I am also a scaredy cat, so of course I keep thinking I hear something when it probably is nothing.  I am kind of hungry, but won't eat because it is too dang late and I shouldn't be eating this late. I am just going to think about what to do today...hmm..bowling...it should be a lot of fun.   HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!   ALthough I don't know if any fathers are reading this, so please tell your respective fathers that I say HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!  I am glad my dad is home. I miss him.  I would work full time to just have him come home more often.  In fact that is why I got the job so we can afford for him to come home.  His pay gets docked a lot when he comes home for visits...so he doesn't come home much.  I am so going to enjoy the time he is here.
