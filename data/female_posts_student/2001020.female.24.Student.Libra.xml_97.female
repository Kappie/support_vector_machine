Didn't feel like graduation, didn't feel like people were as pumped about it as they should be...a big fat letdown overall.  And I haven't really gotten to hang out with PB for a week now, so I'm just gonna get my stuff together and go home.  I know nothing will happen between us and he's just going to move away and that'll be that.  I'll miss him but apparently nothing was meant to happen...
