I'll make a list of some of my "activities" as I remember them:  -15th Street/Powerhouse Park -surfing -tanning -Fish Market -Red Robin -party -alcohol -ganja -hookah -cigarettes -La Jolla Shores -bonfire -political debate -boys :D -RB -In'N'Out -WT crack lady  ketchup -Epicentre show (whilst under the influence) -honking at random people -chorizo -fireworks -Encinitas window shopping at hippie shops w/Insha -SNEAKING OUT (a trillion times) -late night driving -random people -hot boxing car in garage -secrets, secrets -three college guys: shrimpy "baby," the hot one, and the pushover -sleepovers -measly attempt at surfing w/Chris -"Fahrenheit 9/11" -phonecalls from a drunken bitch -waking up and having no clue where I am -embarrassing pictures -random bug bites -fun fun fun  And this is only the beginning. Tomorrow I'm leaving on a trip with my family for Northern California. We're driving up to Napa Valley and visiting a bunch of colleges: UC Davis, UC Berkeley, UCLA, etc. Then we're just gonna poke around there I suppose. When I get back in a week, I'm having my wisdom teeth pulled on July 14th (boohoo). Then I'm probably gonna get back on track again with my "activities." :)  Welps, I miss all of you. Insha, Matt, Azaam, Leela...I hope all of you are having a great summer. Keep in touch! :)  Love always!!
