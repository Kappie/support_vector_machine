Yea, as usual, I went to  urlLink mugglenet.com  and  urlLink blink182.com  to check for updates. I knew from yesterday [or was it the day before? Hm... My memory continues to fail me!] that  Blink  won  best love song  for "I Miss You". Let's take a moment to say, "Awwwwwww....". They also won  best tour  alongside  No Doubt  who toured with them. - Source: those blink sites I always visit.  Mugglenet.com also provided the list of winners becuz  Harry Potter  won  best drama/action movie . Wait, is that right? Urgh, whatever, just know that it's something like that.  Yay! My obessions have a connection! [which I think you're clever enough to realise: Teens' Choice Awards 2004] I know you're calling me crazy, my theory [or connection] is pure fuckin' crap. But I sometimes wonder if  Tom  reads  HP  books. I think  Mark  reads them, he's like the most ideal family guy. I don't even think  Travis  reads, but I'm not a genious either.  I thought I should mention,  Paris[Hilton]  and  Nicole [Ritchie] , the  Ho s are hosting the awards [as stated in the last post already].
