Basically depressed all day, so I slept most of the day...At one point I was going to go back to sleep but decided to check online and lo and behold Austin was on. Some other people were too...with away messages...or just...nothing and I didn't want to talk to them.....But you know, Austin has problems with communicating on the internet, so I just decided to call him. Let me tell you, Austin has officaly made my day with that 30 minute conversation. He's just hilerious. I don't know what I would do without him. And we didn't talk about anything negative or what not, just random stuff so all was well. And I rarley talk to Austin on the phone so it's always interesting.... So anyways, we just talked about how if he ever comes to visit me the first thing that we are going to do is he is going to make me watch the last Lord of the Rings movie. Like, the second he gets here. No hello's. No hugs. Just the movie. Since I haven't seen it, and he's quite disgraced by that...And then we came to the conclusion we were both going to be single for life after sharing the updated stories of "crushes". Hah and how we are going to be very very bitter and be at like Jessa's house in the future with all her kids running around and how we will throw things at her kids. But it was funny, cause I told him if he ever did get a girlfriend, me, Jessa and Jessica will have to interview her before anything happens. Like sit her down in a room. With Jessa and Jessica sitting down on chairs in front of her and then a chair next to them with a phone on it. Which would be me :) And how if she sits down on the chair with the phone on it she is automatically elimanted!!!!! Hah, she must respect the phone. Wouldn't that be a good idea, Jessica? I told him he had to find one soon just so we could do that. Hah and then it was horrible cause I was talking about how it would just be too weird for us to witness Austin having a girlfriend, cause we've known him too long, and I said "Yeah it'd be kinda freaky to go to the movies with you and the girlfriend and see you like making out with her..." AND THAT MOMENT MY MOM WALKED IN. Oy vey. Talk about how people need to learn how to knock in this house.  But anyways on the topic of that...shtuff...afterwards while I was straigtening my hair, listening to Yellowcard, I decided I will never ever again tell a boy I like him. Like, being the first one to say that and all. And how I will never ever again make a move on a boy first either. So Self-Control 101 here I come (hah Katie...). Cause none of those ...ever....ever work out. I think I did that with like the last three crushes I've had, and yeah they all just ended with me being all sad and rejected like. The first crush I had doing that, it was just random and weird and blew up in my face like right away. The second one, I did it a little more slowly, and I thought it was working out until...it blew up in my face. Then the third one, I thought it may work out and was really hoping it would since that was the most I ever liked someone, but that also blew up in my face. So...NO MORE! No more self inflicated emotional pain. So for now on...I am just gonna sit back...relax...and watch absluotly no boys notice me. As usual, but at least I won't be making a fool out of myself during the process.  So I will be single for life.  .....Great.  .....just great.  Sigh...ok I admit it, I would really like a boyfriend...cause just the idea that someone actually likes me in that way...would be awseome....since no one has... :/... but...it never works out that way and I don't want to try to force anything on anyone. Cause that would be rude. I'm already a horrible person, but I don't think I need to become any worse of a person.  But whatever, everything is ok right now in that area, cause at the moment I'm alright without a boyfriend. Well ok so I've always been alright without a boyfriend...obviously...but right now it doesn't really bug me....it just bugs the HELL out of me that I am a 16 year old girl whose never been........ GAH!  Ok end of topic.  How was your day?
