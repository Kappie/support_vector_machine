Wish I had been a little more with it--I still had eye boogers and I hadn't had my morning coffee.  We went to some steak place with giant slabs of meat and rolls as big as softballs.  His dad's running for state rep now, which I find more than a little amusing.  I kind of called that one.  He was so into his son doing it that I could see he wanted to have his fingers in it.  I was afraid he would be weird about me because I am a little older, definitely not conservative, and definitely not East Indian.  I think these worries were unwarranted.  I'm pretty sure it went okay, but I still need to find a cup of coffee somewhere.  Anyhow, to hell with Kansas today.  It feels like an armpit outside.  The sky's all gray.  I feel awesome, though, probably more than I deserve.  I stayed up all night reading Bellwether by Connie Willis.  Such a good book!  It always reinforces my values a little bit, and it also pokes a lot of fun at cool people, which is very gratifying for a nerd like me.  I remember that one of the better ways to be an activist is to live what I believe in and hope it catches on.  Recycling, remembering to tip, patronizing the library, being friendly, voting, not littering...These little things really make a difference.  I often feel like I'm totally powerless against this tidal wave of bad politics, war, environmental waste...But I can take control of my own actions, and hey, that's a good start.  Last night I dreamed about my first boyfriend.  He was a big-footed, long-haired country boy who played role playing games and wore a shirt with a Superman insignia on it.  He lived with his mom in a trailer home on a wild patch of land on the outskirts of town.  The whole thing was done in sunflowers.  Man, it was crazy.  She had her crocheted sunflowers, her clear plastic sunflowers, her sunflower afghans, candles, cups, flip flops, coasters, cookies jars, curtains...None of them really matched.  (My roommate calls this "conspicuous consumption, and she says it affects the poor and uneducated.)  It was like some surreal garden in there, and everyone of those flowers was a little dingy, asphyxiated from the long white cigarettes she used to smoke.    My boyfriend's room was the only sunflower-free area.  He had Heavy Metal posters and plaster of paris dragons and swords and comic books and Star Wars toys.  He probably still does--All he ever talked about was how great it was to be a kid.  He was a really really big kid.  I guess he never crosses my mind anymore, but he was my first genuine boyfriend.  We dated for almost two years.  I wonder how he's doing, but I know I won't bother finding out.  I dreamed we were  in this pretty sunlit room getting cozy together on a blanket of many colored yarns.    So I am broke again.  Broke broke broke.  I have been a spending fool.  I've had so many gifts to get.  Wedding gifts, birthday gifts, graduation gifts.  Plus the usual bills and crap.  And of course whenever I go to the store to pick up a bottle of detergent, I walk out of there with a basket of plastic hair clips, fruit scented shampoos, sugar free chocolates, and cute panties.  I am a big sucker.  The musak goes to my head and I forget I can't even pay my tuition.  I need to visit Billy Talen's Church of Stop Shopping.  Add that to my sizable list of self improvements.
