All the talk has been, and the supposed purpose of the Commission is, to asses the response to the threat of 9/11 in order to preven it from happening again.  But watching this morning, I was struck by the animosity some of those from some of the Commissioners toward Dr. Rice, particularly in those "questions" from former Senator Bob Kerrey.  Now, I've always liked and respected Mr. Kerrey.  But he seemed to take this opportunity to learn more and use it to score political points, first urging Dr. Rice to use her influence within the administration to signal some change in the current actions of the U.S. in Iraq.  This is something so blatantly without the scope of the Commission that even Kerrey's preface that he would not get another opportunity to speak with her about his feelings was not enough.  It makes one wonder what the tone of the secret meetings of the commisssion have been like, without cameras for everyone to play to.    I felt Dr. Rice held her own pretty well.  She was forceful and firm when needed, without ever being rude, even when subject to what I would characterize as rudeness from members of the Commission.  I'm not sure the testimony really cleared anything up though.  I'm not sure it was all that productive.  Perhaps I will glance over the transcript later and see if I can glean something from it.  The whole point seems academic anyway, since 9/11 did happen, and while I think the goal of preventing future attacks is a worthy one, the Commission seems to be putting itself more to the uses of attacking what wasn't done, rather than trying to use it as a learning experience.  But I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  If you put a bunch of lawyers and politicians in a room with cameras, and a lot of buzz assuring a major audience, they are going to resort to things like this.  Everything is political after all, especially in an election year.  Silly of me to expect something different when the topic is as serious as this.
