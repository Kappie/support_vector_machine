(haha.. and this is only the third time im going to post..) i promise.. this would be a little longer than my other posts... hehe..   last friday.. my friend jaymee and i got stranded in school.. if you're wondering how that happened.. the angels were crying at that time and practically flooded EDSA walk.. haha.. we were hanging out at edsa walk.. we were listening to jaymee's cd(it has nice songs in it.. nyahaha..) and then we realized that it was already flooded.. so we decided to evacuate.. haha... we continued sound trippin' at the kostka benches.. hehe.. and like any normal teenager.. we eventually got bored(rili bored).. hehe.. so jaymee dared me to wave/smile at people.. and since i was rili bored.. i dared her back.. (pretty smart of me huh?! nyahaha) anyways.. kumaway at ngumiti kami... pero some people didn't notice us.. and one girl paid too much attention to us.. hehe.. she asked us if we were from Gabay(it's an org..and we are not from that org..).. so we came up with plan B.. what's plan b? wla.. hehe.. de kidding lang.. we made a sign that says "SMILE".. it's cute, mind you.. nyahaha.. so.. while listening to jaymee's CD's.. we held the sign up.. para makita ng mga dumadaan.. other people smiled.. others.. didn't.. others tried not to..(they were trying too hard!!! they looked so cute! esp. the guy eating a lolly.. i saw you smiling!!) when asked y we were doing it.. we just said "we want to make other people happy!" and honestly, it felt rili nice seeing other people smile..     we started a smile crusade and i rili think it's nice if you start your own.. make other people smile.. samahan nyo pa ng hug wars.. hehe..   a smile starts within a person's heart..it comes from true happiness... sa mga ayw ngumiti.. if it makes you feel better... we will all find a reason to be happy.. and i'm sure that it would bring a smile to our faces..   it's a nice feeling... promise.. so just SMILE!!!    >rOgEe
