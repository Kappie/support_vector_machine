I think I was running on will power on the last couple of days since I came home and slept from 1am-11am and then 2pm-5pm...I think that's around 14 hours of sleep. I think I can honestly tell you all that I've never done that before. (Josh I now know the power of cherry coke=energy) Anyway I loved my roommates and I'm going to miss them, the randomness of our songs, the pregnancies and births, the veggie tales, the red-neckness, and the FON's/ DWH's. Ask me sometime what those means....each has a story that I don't have the coordination to type out but they are amusing to say the very least. I have a stalker and so did my roommate. I met some awesome guys and gals in my mission track team. I now have my own body guard that is HUGE...but he's in knoxville and he's also a youth leader. That came in handy when I told him that Fletch the stalker was being too friendly.  I think I'm going to try to get in touch with Cityteam...my favortie mission track. they're a drug rehab place for Chester. Chester was the good part of town to be in they it went down so now you can't walk outside after dusk or bad bad things happen. But i loved it. God's love was so alive there. Here in Brentwood it's common for people to take God's love taken for granted but the ones that were saved in Chester, they had suffered much but they also knew the greatness of God and they worshiped with a passion that I find lacking in Brentwood. I went to M-fuge to partly test my faith and see if I truly did believe...I found instead that passion for living in Christ that I've been lacking. Most don't know but I've been a christian ever since I was 7 but I drifted throughout intermediate and middle school. Those were horrible years so I've never told you before what happened then. If you guys really search, I don't think you'll ever find that I've really mentioned my middle school years beyond the fact that I hated them, I went to FMS, and I knew Arden and Christina. Becuase of those awful years I started at BBC and I have worlds of thanks to give them. I found a loving and supporting group where I did get to know Him more and now he's my Friend. I can't wait for school to start. I've failed so many times and yet he's still willing to see if my faith lasts and I pray that it will this time through out the school year and beyond. I love you all guys.
