My bed frame chose a very opportune time to break, but that was about the worst of it. Yesterfay was saturday the fourteenth, also known as valentine's day. It was lovely, it really really was. Mom finished my dress at like, 5:30 but it was so beautiful. I kept getting comments like "you look like a princess!" I loved it. I had dinner at alex's house (heart shaped pizza and a salad which was quite good). It was a really wonderful night, the best valentines day I can remember. Every thing just went right. Everything as so perfect. You have no idea how much it meant to me. It was just so perfect...   Sorry, back to the real world (I got lost there for a sec) So today I went to church and then to southwic to learn that the walden's book store was already closed. Poop, at least I still got miyuki-chan! I had a really good day with alex. We went back to his house after shopping and watch underworld. Well, I watched it, alex fell asleep on my tummy. Teeheehee, he was snoring. But it was a really good movie, and alex was very warm, so it was a rather wonderful experience. Have you ever heard the song "I miss you"? Have you ever heard the song "I miss you" and wanted to cry? Have you ever heard the song "I missed you" and cried so hard that you wished you could run over to their house just to make sure it wasn't a dream?   Sorry. Back to the real world.
