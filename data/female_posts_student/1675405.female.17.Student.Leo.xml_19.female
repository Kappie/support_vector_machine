Marie is really being horrible towards me recently, and I know its because she knows she can get away with it and still have me there for her when she's down. Today I said something about Aaron and Jessie, and she said "Well maybe it's weird, but probably because you're jealous of her because she got something you wanted but could never have." Me, being the better of the two, left the lunchtable, and went to sit in the lobby by myself.  Heather and Jen are talking, and I read an email. I knew Jen would lose it in college, and she did. No specifics, because I really don't feel comfortable with putting them on the net, but I am really worried for that girl. She used to be a sweet little 4.0 girl, but now she's horrible, and I'm glad I don't have anything to do with her.  But what really irks me is that Heather told me before that the only reason Jen is acting like that is because Heather was a bad influence on her. Well, if that is completely so, then this is Heather's fault, and Heather is one of my best friends!!!! How could this happen?!!?  I'm really iffy about homecoming. I was excited when Wade asked me, yes, but now I realize that he probably asked me because that was the closest he could get to her. I feel horrible, probably because I don't know the boy very well, and am entirely too shy to do much about it. I know Heather gave him my number, but if he doesn't call, then it's just going to be pretty bad. I feel bad. If he is going to pay for everything...I'm going to feel pretty darn bad, but no one will know because I'm not going to open my mouth and ruin everything for myself. I'll just smile and pretend I don't think about anything. Argh!! I feel like screaming.  Today in tennis I screwed up my right wrist even more than it has been screwed up. I couldn't even hit anymore, and had to sit out the rest of practice with ice. But, the good thing about that was that I got to talk to Ricky and Tyus, both of whom have been incredibly nice and polite towards me lately, and it really makes me feel good. Like I've got some good friends. You know?  Jessie thinks that I hate her, but really it isn't her. Nor is it Aaron, directly at least. It's just that I would expected a lot more out of him, but I guess he's hormonal and now the typical boy. Funny thing is, I really liked him before because he wasn't like everyone else, and now he is. But anyways, she thinks I'm mad at her because what,  she stole Aaron away from me?? Oh my goodness! Things are so wrong!
