Yesterday I saw my "stalker" at the BBQ and thenI saw "IT" again today at the grocery store. Then i sware"IT" drove past my house today. O well maybe it is just my imaganation. I hope it is just my imganation. But today i went to the mall with Jacob and got my ring. It is really pretty. I am so excited.I am really hyper for some reason tonight. It might have to do with the yummy shake i made. SUGAR GOOD!! Well tomorrow pre-camp starts, kinda. We have the picnic tomorrow and all the freshmen find out who thier masters are and everyone finds out who is in thier cabin. I am not to eagar to find out my cabin seeing that none of my "friends" are in it. If you are wondering about my friends in quotations it is becuz as of right now i feel like i have no friends really. Like even Jessie feels like she is drifting away from me. She is always somewhere else having more fun then she would ever have with me. O well it don't matter i got Jake and a couple of other friends and that is all that matters. O yea Brenden won't be in band this year. he was over in Europ and he hyper-exstended his knee and tore a ligament. I feel so bad. That is just really REALLY suckie. But Matt returned home safely,I think. He said he was gonna come out and see me when he returned but he hasn't, o well he is probley doin better things then bug me. WOW i can't belive that the summer is almost over with, it has seemed so short but yet somedays it seems like it shall never end. I will be glad to go back tho. I want to see my "friends" again. I think b4 the summer is done with tho i want to take a cuple of friends and go play laser tag. It sounds like fun. I know that Katie would enjoy it. Megan might go with me again too. ok well i am done talking to the wall now so peace out ppl   ~*~Karebear~*~
