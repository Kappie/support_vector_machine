Well, as it draws ever so close to the Backstreet Boys album release time I am reminded of why the Backstreet Boys have meant so much to me.  So here it goes. I am reminded of how much their music has meant to me and how I supported them right from the start.  I suppose you could say I never really lost the desire to keep the kid in me. I know that I'll never acutally be a kid again but I can capture the moments of my care free teenaged years when I listen to the Backstreet Boys.  They keep me young and vital something that just doesn't happen with other groups.
