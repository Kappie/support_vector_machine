APES takes the lead by far, today we went outside and played some challenge game, that had nothing to do with environmental science at all. It consisted of reading people's minds, jumping on walls, and Harry Potter. Ms.Brongo rocks, that class is so much fun with her.  It's thundering, I love thunder. Especially those really loud claps that scare the hell out of everyone...scared people are funny. And it DID rain today.  I have to make food for history tomorrow...  my thoughts are so spontaneous.
