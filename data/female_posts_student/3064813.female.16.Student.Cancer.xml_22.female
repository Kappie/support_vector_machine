Come down on the street and dance with me     I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting  I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me     I asked you to go to the Green Day concert  You said you never heard of them  -How cool is that?-  So I went to your room and read your diary:  "watching Grunge leg-drop New-Jack through a press table..." and then my heart stopped:  "listening to Cio-Cio San fall in love all over again."     How stupid is it? I can't talk about it  I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart  (How stupid is it? Won't you give me a minute  Just come up to me and say hello to my heart) How stupid is it?  For all I know you want me too and maybe you just don't know what to do or maybe you're scared to say: "I'm falling for you"  I wish I could get my head out of the sand 'cuz I think we'd make a good team  and you would keep my fingernails clean  but that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize  'cuz I can't even look in your eyes without shakin', and I ain't fakin'  I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon.   -El Scorcho, Weezer   ONLY THE COOLEST WEEZER SONG EVER!!!
