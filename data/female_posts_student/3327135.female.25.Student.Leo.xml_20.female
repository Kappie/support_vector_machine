She committed suicide. :P  Sigh, after the long wait for episode 5  6, I have to wait for episode 7  8.   The story is getting better. The preview (shown in K-100) shows that Kou Shan's mother had an affair with Hui Man Piu. And Kou Shan was crying, suspecting herself as the lovechild of her mother and HMP. But, I think this scene is just to mislead us. I think probably, Sze Ching (KS's cousin sister) is the lovechild. Hehehe... I wonder whether I had guessed correctly this time.  Kou Shan -- Flora Chan Morning Sir -- Roger Kwok
