Things have been fantastic lately in my life apart from a few bumps along the way. Im officially on school holidays now, I had my last exam yesterday. I publish my results when i get them, if they r not too bad that is. My Deb was last saturday night. It was a fantastic night. I was pampered all day! I got my nails done, my hair styled beautifully, fake tanned and my face was turned beautiful wi8th a great job by mel from giannis with my make up. All this with my beautiful dress and matching jewelery i felt like a princess. I could definatley do that for the rest of my life lol. It was amazing, after the formal part was over I swarmed by my guests with cameras. Clicking everywhere, smiling and poseing all the time. It was fun to be in the limelight for once. Anyway i have to go ill talk about all that has happened in more detail l8er. Cya.
