If these people don't want to ensure that they get enough food, a good time or any of the important stuff. Well that's it, they can just go fuck themselves. I've done all I can now all I can do is hope that they show up for Raven. The really important people will be there. Myself, Beth, Cate, Laura, and well Raven. If we are lucky the others will show up too. if they don't then there will be hell to pay. She deserves to have her friends there. Already they've made it difficult but I refuse to allow them to make this day less than fun. I'm still trying to figure out if this will be a sleep overy type thing. Must bring that up as a plussish bonus deal thing. Maybe we'll watch Willow, I know raven loves that movie. If there are others around then we'll have fun with that as well.   I haven't done as much in the way of editing as I would have liked to. But I've gotten a good deal done. I'm going to finish up the parts that I've stated, and leave the rest to Beth. She should like that I know she's missed editing. I'll tell her to lay off until the 15th or so though so that she devotes her time to the party instead. Beth if you read this before I talk to you that's what I'm thinking.   At the moment I'm in a state of pissed off at my computer. It won't let me send, or save emails that I write. Which I think is odd. As well it won't allow me to read Laurell K Hamilton's blog or see her entire menu. It also doesn't want me to go onto my writers board. It normally is more then happy to let me go there. I want to read the stuff damn it.   I want my bethie. I'll give in now. She's coming home today, I'm allowed, becasue she's coming home. Late, might I add. I was under the impressiont that she was coming home on the tenth, no. I was like "well she's coming home on the 10th so I'll call her ont he 11th" Well forget that, if it's not too late she'd sure as hell better call me. Well even if it is late she can call me. Post! Dear god post, I'm ok with that f you post I will respond! Damn I miss her. Bloody hell I'm trying to refrain from being poetic.   What's worse is she'll be home long enough for the party and to go to the lake with me, then next week on the 20th I'm gone, and in the middle of me being gone she'll leave and then I have to wait for the beginning of august to see her again. Well I'm leaving now. I have to go maybe I'll eat a double brownie, that I made, that tastes so good you would cry.
