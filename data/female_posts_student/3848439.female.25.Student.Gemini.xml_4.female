And my really spiffy iMac has a CD and DVD burner.  Yippee that!  Anyway, at the beginning of last school year I went on a bit of a downloading and burning run.  So here's the play list from my music collection entitled "Oh Happy Day!  Disk 1 of a continuing series"  1. Let's Groove - Earth, Wind,  Fire 2. Alligator King - Muppets 3. As - George Michael feat.
