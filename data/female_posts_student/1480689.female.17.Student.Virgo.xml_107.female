I don't dislike her, but christ, my b-day party isn't open invite. arg.  excited for friday and at the same time, dissappointed that i can't go to see embrace this night and the red letters. fuuuck.  then saturday, ohhh hooray! i've decided that I'm gonna go get my hair cut, then  work from 1-5 then have my party from 6:30-11:30. yep, full day.  whatever.
