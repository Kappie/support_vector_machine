The clan came and picked me up and we went to the video store only to decide that we really didn't want anything, so we went downtown Naperville for a bit. It was good times.     Then, I felt bad for not going out with Matthew as I said I would, so I went out with him and Chris for about an hour. And, I can't believe I'm still up. I need sleep but, Chris wants to sneak out, so I'm going to take a walk with him. It shall be fun.     Today was pretty bad other than that though. It's not great being blamed for something that isn't your fault ever. It just made me very angry. However a good friend of mine said tthat I have a terrific laugh. It made me really happy because he seemed so sincere about it. Just him saying that one thing to me made my day a ton better.     But anyway, it's sad. I wont get to see the clan for so long. :( Maybe they can pick me up from my sectional tomorrow night.  Plus, I want to go see Mary Clare and Stephen while they're working. Maybe the clan can take them out to lunch.     For those of you who don't know, the clan consists of Stephen, MC, Tom (even though he has since left)  Jeremy, Chen, Amit, Roger, Kels, Kath, and myself. It's a good clan.  It was really the boys to begin with, but Kels, Kath, MC, and myself have kind of....pushed our way into it. :)
