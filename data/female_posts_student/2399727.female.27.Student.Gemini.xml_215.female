Most valuable for those coping with vision loss in one form or another, I think, but it contains many lessons for the fully sighted as well.  I was most taken aback by the reactions of the sighted towards the blind and the injustice that still exists.  His reluctance to use a cane, no doubt imbedded in him by the hatred of his mother towards the blind world, and his ability to overcome that and acquire Corky were inspiring.  I loved the line about wondering whether inflicting opera on a guide dog was a form of cruelty to animals.  Wagner, perhaps!   My favourite part was Kuusisto's vision of the planet of the blind on page 148:   On the planet of the blind,  no one needs to be cured .   Blindness is another form of music , like the solo clarinet in the mind of Bartók.     On the planet of the blind, the citizens live in the susurrus of cricket wings tinkling in inner space.   You can hear the stars on the windless nights of June.  On the planet of the blind, people talk about what they do not see, like Wallace Stevens, who freely chased tigers in red weather.  Here, mistaken identities are not the stuff of farce.  Instead, unvexed, the mistaken discover new and friendly adjacent arms to touch.  On this particular planet, the greyhounds get to snooze at last in the tall grass.  The sighted are beloved visitors, their fears of blindness assuaged with fragrant reeds.  On the planet of the blind, everyone is free to touch faces, paintings, gardens – even the priests who have come here to retire.  There is no hunger in the belly or in the eyes.  And the furniture is always soft.  Chairs and tables are never in the way.  On the planet of the blind, the winds of will are fresh as a Norwegian summer.   And the sky is always between moonshine and morning star .   God is edible.   On the planet of the blind self-contempt is a museum .   (Bolding is by the author of the blog.)
