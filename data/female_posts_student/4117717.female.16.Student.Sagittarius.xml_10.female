Last night I wrote down who I was completley. I hate myself, more now then I ever have before. I don't know if I have enough strength to change. I'm so sorry to everyone I know. I really am a horrible person, very selfish. But I will find the strength to change, I just need something to believe in. I keep thinking that might make everything a little better.
