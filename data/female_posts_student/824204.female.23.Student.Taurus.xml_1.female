I'm ready to go out there and tackle the world and do great things like.... my laundry for example!!  My laundry has piled up so high I can barely look over it, well I'm only 5'2 but imagine that!!??? Can you imagine it!?  I wish I had a little friend who does nothing but do the laundry, like one of those little dwarfs or elves in the Filipino fables who does things for you while you're asleep or when you're not looking.. Yeah.. I want one of those.. then again.. I'm delusional so who cares right?  *little friend little friend... won't you do my laundry* if only......   Speaking of friends... not to sound like I'm advertising... but you need to try FRIENDSTER... it's awesome!! I can't believe I'm reconnecting with people I haven't heard from or seen in such a long time.. makes one realize how small the world really is when it comes to the internet! Of course reconnecting with people from your past means also bringing the past back... well at least in your head.. you think about the "GOOD OLD DAYS"  if they were any good that is... and then you think of your past relationships all those failed friendships and such.. ITS DEPRESSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *counting 1...2...3* Ok I'm calm again.. Well gotta face the world and do my laundry.. so til next time..........
