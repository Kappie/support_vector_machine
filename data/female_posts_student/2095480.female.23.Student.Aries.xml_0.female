Saturday was a football game here at #2 in the nation in football VSU. It turned out to be a really close game, won in the last quarter, and we definitely had God on our side. They had the ball on their two yard line with 10 seconds... how we defended, I'm not so sure, but we did. Anyway, it provided for about 5 minutes of playing the HEY song followed by a few repetitions of the fight song and the "Defense cheer" that we now play from the movie Drumline. Those of you in the band world know what I'm talking about.  After roasting in the sun at the football game, it was time to come home, recover, and get all cute for the opera. I had too, because two days of being in a band uniform is enough to make anyone want to feel pretty once again. So, I got all "girled' up in a little black dress and strappy heels. Not to brag, but I'll give myself props on this one. I was really surprised with how it all came together, as were my friends there. Okay ya'll, I do own cute clothes, and I do know how to put it together, I just usually don't because there really isn't a reason to look "cute" for class. Why anyone would want to wear top fashion to a 9am computer class is beyond me. Jeans and some sort of tshirt usually works just fine for me. Anyway, the Marriage of Figaro rocked, and I thought it was one of the best VSU operas I've ever seen (out of five). Afterwards, I went to dinner with Keith and Russ, and we talked about the "old" times of VSU. Not too old though, I'm referring to the late nineties. We had a great time, and I finally felt like I was "living" life for a moment.  Sunday I spent mostly sleeping, which is absolutely required once in a while. I'll leave that statement where it stands.   Monday, today, was not so fun. Yeah. Okay, here's the deal. Due to one advising error and 3 over-lapping classes, I can not graduate until December 2004. I was very ill with the situation at the time, and poor Mom and Dad got an earful from me about it. I know its not their fault, but I had to vent at someone. I guess I am kinda fortunate. Its another half-year of college. Its just the principle of the thing that got to me.  Well, I can not leave with out another thought.  "Education has for its object the formation of character." ~Herbert Spencer (1820-1903)  Okay, so I have absolutely no idea who Spencer is, but I like the quote. Without the challenges, defeats, and complications one experiences at college, character would not be built. Not only does the education taught in the classroom teach us something, but so does the education we get from dealing with people, and with dealing with ourselves while at college. Maybe God wants me to have one really strong character for something in the future... that would explain yet another semester here.....  I did get to talk with two of my best friends tonight. I don't know what I would do without Irene and Scott. Of friends:  "A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of Nature." ~Emerson  That's it for tonight. Peace.
