Like, for instance, my brother comes into the bedroom, and starts to talk to “Mr. X” we’ll call him.  Well, Mr. X just starts shit with my LITTLE brother.  And it gets me thinking.  What the hell does he think he is doing, as well as anyone.  Why do people think they have the right to bring others down?!  People do it to me all the time.  Big deal.  All I care about is what I think, and what my friends think.  And obviously I am not doing EVERYTHING wrong, because if you have read any of the other articles, you would know I have some pretty amazing friends.  Back to the point, I don’t understand what it is about some people who say whatever they want to whoever they want.  Now, I’m not saying in any way, shape, or form, that I don’t bring others down.  I do, just as much as any normal human.  But I mean those people who bring everyone down, all the time, everyday.  Why?  To make themselves feel better?  To make everyone else focus on the problems of others and not them?  I know I do it, I am the first one to admit it, but I always feel remorseful, and I wish I didn’t do it so much.  Most of the time, its something stupid that I don’t mean anyway, but Mr. X was just taking my brother down, and it made me mad.  There is no reason for anyone to continually bring others down, for whatever reason.  Ever.
