"From  Beauty at its Source:  If you go on as you plan, I think that as you learn to love beauty at its source, all the missing pieces will come to hand, and in the end you will have made a beautiful picture out of what was formerly only a puzzle."  " Futures:     I had rather expected that you would begin to worry.  It is encouraging because it means you have begun to look ahead.  You are examining the future, seeing its trials, its patent impossibilities, and you are experiencing them beforehand.  You are really crossing many bridges, or endeavouring to cross them, before you come to where they are.    I say it is a good sign, but you must not allow yourself to be upset by it.  I think we often make ourselves ill with needless worry.  After all we cannot change the future very much anyhow.  You need only make just a little distinction in order to have done with it all.    There is a future of whose coming you can be certain.  It is the end of your life, say forty or sixty years away.  "Ask and you shall receive" and with God's grace you will be ready when it comes.  Final perseverance is His gift, but you can be very confident that He will not refuse it.  Then there is another future which does not frighten you.  That is today and some of tomorrow -- but not much of the day after tomorrow.  You know what you are going to do today and I do not imagine you have any great fear that you will not be able to carry on till sunset.  These two futures, or aspects of the future do not worry you so much.  But all the days that come in between?  About those we know very little and can do very little.  They are full of dark streams spanned by perilous bridges, uncanny footpaths, and robbers and wild beasts and all such manner of things.  At least you think so.  But, you know, all those tomorrows are only todays coming after one another.  If with God's help you can carry on till sunset today and then until sunrise tomorrow -- why then you can go on infinitely!  Now suppose you sit down quietly and sort your worries out, the way you would pod peas or sort socks.  Put a tag on each one of them with the date written upon it.  Then go over the dates.  If you find any dated "today" or dated "the end of life" -- those you may keep.  But all the others dated in between you can pitch out the window.  They are neither edible nor usable.  Maybe that is what our Lord meant -- sufficient for the day is the evil thereof."
