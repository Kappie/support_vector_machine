So this gives me a huge advantage when coming to getting the latest info on the latest games that squaresoft makes and produce. One such project that is coming out soon is the movie DVD Final Fantasy vii Advent Children!!!!!! I've been waiting for like i since don't know when. Espeacially with the fact that this only comes out in Japan, I can't wait till I get hold of it. Man am i lucky to be born partly japanese or what!! This is gonna be so exciting with the fact that I already finished the japanese Final Fantasy VII!!!! I just wanta know what the new sort of threat is and that what actually happens after the game itself. The trailer itself was good enough for me to just want it even more!!! UURRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!(*_*)
