My yiayia is in the hospital for pnemonia. I REALLy want her to get better. On the phone today I says, "Παρακαλώ; Ακριβώς το δοκιμάστε έξω για μερικούς μήνες. It's πραγματικά μόνος εδώ χωρίς σας και σας χάνω alot. Παρακαλώ; Θέλω πραγματικά να σας έχω με." She said she didn't know if she would, but I REALLy want her to come to live with us!! To have her with us would be    HEAVEN   !! Uncle Vasili is really lonely in Athens and my Uncle Tassos wants  him  to come and live with  them . O, well. Greek family life is SO complicated. Everyone knows EVERYTHING about you.  It's quite amusing.  Hey Adrastosmou! S'gapoe! Kali nixta kai na klanies oule nixta!!! LOLOLOLOLOL!!!   S'gapoe,  Kali Nixta (really!!)  Athena (lol. Inside joke....remember last festival??)
