I will put a picture of her on the web site later.  Today we are going to Harriet's for her son's birthday. He  one now. Austin and his kids are going to be there. I think Uncle Barry and Aunt Ginger will be there and Grandpa and Aunt Rossetta. Not sure who else will be there. It should be fun. Well gotta get going so I can find a gift for him and get me and the kids ready to go. Until next time.
