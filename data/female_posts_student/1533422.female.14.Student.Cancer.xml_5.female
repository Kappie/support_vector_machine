I keep coughing up phlegm (you really don't want to know this) and Katherine reckons I've got TB.  Always so optimistic, is my sister.  But TB is blood, not phlegm, right? Anyway, I woke my mum up at one this morning cuz I was coughing so much.  Don't know how she heard - must have supersonic hearing or something.  (Remember Sonic the hedgehog? I used to love him.  What was the squirrel's name?  I can't remember.  I'm not even sure it was a squirrel.  Oh well.)  So anyway, she went to get me a honey and lemon thingy, and can I just say that they are so nice!  It stopped me coughing a bit too.  I always get colds in the holidays.  Wonder how I'm going to manage it in the summer.  My immune system fighting a disease is like a small jut of land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, only big enough to hold half a penguin, trying to take on the rest of the world.  Or just the half-penguin trying to take on the rest of the world.  It really is crappy.    I'm getting my hair cut tomorrow!  After I have a filling put in ... according to the dentist, it's not like a proper filling, but just some stuff to fill a hole that my tooth grew with, so food doesn't get stuck in it.  My mum had a go at me for having too much sugar in my tea (four sugars, minimum) but the dentist kept saying it was the natural growth of the tooth, blah blah blah.  I've given up tea temporarily, though - I was having too much and caffeine is apparently bad for a lot of things.  Plus, I don't want to become diabetic with all the sugar intake.  So my hair, then.  I'm quite nervous, because it's going to be all layery and the layers start off quite short - it's that model's hair from those shampoo ads in magazines that are good for long hair, or something.  I found a big pic in a hair mag that didn't have any writing or shampoo bottles on it and I thought it was really cool.  I'm not sure about losing the length though.  I bet, now I've had this stress, no one will even notice it was cut.  Although they should do ... but I suppose after the fallout, we're not going to be on absolutely perfect terms ...  About the fallout.  I just apologised to Charlotte.  I can't be arsed to carry it on because I just can't be arsed.   Nor can I be arsed to argue about that guy from Good Charlotte being fit.  I think Good Charlotte are really crap, but that one guy - Billy, I think he's called - is really hot!!  I can't stand Joel, though - I would happily rip him limb from limb. Heh heh heh ... she also doesn't think Elliott's fit.  Actually, no one thinks Elliott's fit, except me.  He is sooooooooo gorgeous!  So what if he's fifteen and fancies Claudia Schiffer?  She's not that ... well, she is that pretty.  But ... he ... I ... it's not fair!  God, I really hope no one finds this.  That inspires the question - why the hell did I make it then?  God knows.  I just wanted a purdy new blog *shifts from one foot to the other restlessly*.  I can't wait till my sister's party!!  It's on the 15th May, which is ages away, but still ...  I've got a pink swirly skirt for it from Dorothy Perkins.  But I also got this really cool dress with strawberries all over it from H  M, and it has a really cool swirly skirt, too - so now I don't know what to do.  It all depends on what shoes I get.  If I get the gorgeous black ones with the buckle from New Look that I'm not allowed cuz my mum thinks they're too high, then I could wear either, but I'd rather wear the pink skirt.  If I get pink shoes, then I can't wear the strawberry dress, cuz you can't wear pink with red unless you're going for the punk look.  And if I get red shoes I can't wear the pink skirt.  It's so confusing ...  I don't know what to do.  I know that no one will want me there, and if I touch any alcohol I will probably get roaring drunk.  I really can't handle my drink at all.  I got drunk in R.E. when they gave me and teensy bit of wine when I was part of the Passover meal thing (youngest person in the class, had to do it.  My best mate is the oldest girl, so she was in it, too).  And these Chinese people gave my a Baccardi Breezer - big mistake.  I was really tipsy.  I wasn't allowed any Bailey's Glide afterwards.  I can just imagine it, at Katherine's party, being all slurry and going, "You know what, Claire?  You're my only ... my only friend ... in the whole world ..." and then going to someone else, "Michael, if you were a man, and I was a woman ... heh heh heh."  Dear God, don't let me near alcohol.  But I really want a watermelon Baccardi ... I've never tried one before.  They look nice.  I think I'd better go.  I really have to be in bed early because 1) the dentist appointment is at 9:40 AM (!!) and 2) I don't want to be totally shattered, after spending most of last night either reading Harry Potter or coughing up green goop.  Farewell  *~Jools~*  Elliott, you sexy thing, wake up and notice I exist, dammit!
