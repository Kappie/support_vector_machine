Anyway I decide to start this because I know most of my friends probably won't ever look at this and it maybe a good way to get a lot of my anger out! It will be great!  To start toned I just hung out with family lets just say this was the WORST MAY LONG OF MY LIFE!!!!! I got to see my uncle tho.  But then I found out his girlfriend who he has been dating I don't know forever off and on and has been living with him hasn't slept in the same bed as him since there were here last like 3 months ago.  So my question for her is what made her decide that this amazing guy deserves to be treated like shit.  Thanks uncle for coming to visit us it was great! That stupid bitch needs to watch her back because the Pastl's can be nice one min and the next she wont know what hit her! TREAT YOU BOYFRIENDS HOW YOU THINK HIS SISTERS WILL TREAT YOU!!!! GRRR! As well tonight I went to my aunts who I thought was the most controlling person ever and she really isn't that bad!:D it was fun! I met my adopted cousin and my baby cousin who lives far away and he fell asleep in my arms tonight! It was fun! lol and I learned how to my Domino's with my cheating 10 year old cousin.  Yes I have a FUN LIFE!!! NOT!!!! ASHLEY, MICHELLE, MEGAN, JACKIE, RHIANNON WHERE ARE YOU GUYS!!!! I NEEDED SOMETHING TO DO TONIGHT!!!!!GRRRR!!!! MEH! Life will go on! haha sorry about the caps locked but that was my way of yelling! Okay so this week I had a mental break down and Devin yea DEVIN! Was there for me to talk to and I had the best talk of my life with him and the old Devin is back:D tear! It was awesome! And Neil gave me a great song too I will give you the lyrics tomorrow....Maybe! Anyway I am going to go since I kind of need some sleep later gator!
