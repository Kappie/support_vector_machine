But you read things, and you see things, and sometimes.... People are shitheads.  That's also a generalization, but it's true, too.  They don't.... Sometimes I think that love is the worst thing God could have ever created.  I suppose it's necessary to the human race, but it hurts.  And something like love shouldn't hurt... but it does.  Stupid God and his stupid inventions.
