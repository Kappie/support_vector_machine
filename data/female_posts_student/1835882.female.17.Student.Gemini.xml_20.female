Auditions are next weekend! that means next week is major crunch time! oh no!  for missing 2 days of school i got most of my h.w. all done w/ the exception of French and my math quiz and test.   i wonder what im doing this weekend...i have no clue...all i know is that i have to go to the game and that is about all i know so far...maybe Jaime and i will go to the movies...who knows.
