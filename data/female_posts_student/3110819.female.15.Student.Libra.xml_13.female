I have this thing called an antrochoanal polyp in my sinuses, and I have to get it removed. Thank the Lord I won't be awake during it, but it is going to hurt a crapload afterward. Only nice thing about that is I get to miss P.E., which is a waste of my time, so that makes me happy.  I worked at Work of Our Hands yesterday. It was really nuts cause of Tulip Time coming up and all. At least I finally learned to use credit cards there. Oh, tourists. Driving around at 5 miles an hour. Don't ya love 'em! Still, I can't wait till Tulip Time, even though I've gotta march, which will, as always, suck.  I cleaned today and did some homework. Hehe. Now I'll have money. Plus I cleaned out a buncha crap from my room to get rid of for the church garage sale next week. Boy, I've got a lotta crap.  btw, if you haven't see  The League of Extraordinary Gentleman , the title will make no sense. Although it's quite possible it still may not even if you've seen it....
