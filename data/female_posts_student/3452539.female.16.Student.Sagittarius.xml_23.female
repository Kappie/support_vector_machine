I could only imagine the reprocussions of that.   English - watched a bit more of Macbeth and could barely stay awake  Contemporary - listened to a lady drone on about her college that had no appeal to me  Study - went to the library and did a good chunk of work for my English final  Precalculus - actually took a quiz and answered all questions. If I had answered them correctly or not is a whole different story. I need to stay after with him and go over material for the final.  Chemistry - took notes and got confused all period. I eventually have to look at that material tonight. I am staying after for review for that final tomorrow.  History - watched a movie and Sjodin gave me her personal phone number to call her and remind her about bringing in another movie which I did around 7:15 pm.  My dad forgot about picking me up from school this afternoon but once he did we headed over to the middle school so I could give Michelle the applications and tell her what was going on. I also put in an announcement for the middle schoolers. I told her about my dorm experience and she was basically shocked. It was pretty funny. She and I need to chill sometime because we need to catch up and I want to show her my pictures n'such.  Got home, got changed, ran for 20 minutes.   A short time after I got out of the shower and talked to my stepmom about joining her and my aunt at the gym/getting a nutritionalist, the power died. For about 3.5 hours. I just used my cell phone to call everyone. I found a spot where I get wicked good reception. 40 minutes without a problem :-)  Talked to my stepmom about not volunteering this weekend. I am all set now. Time to rest a bit this weekend for the big upcoming one.   I also talked to her about my getting my own apartment in a few years. We discussed me maybe doing a dorm for 2 years, then a 5-year lease on an apartment in MA. My rents are actually thinking about moving out to Holyoke. After high school anyways, where I will have moved out on my own. But yeah, she agrees with me doing my own place, roommate recommended, but I do not forsee that as being a problem.    Well, there is a lot of work for finals to do and things are on a roll for FOCC. I am going to talk to people tomorrow night and get in contact with Rage about finally getting a large meeting in :-)  Oh, 2005 FIRST Update, compliments of RJ from Rage:   MyMountainDew173:  2005 championship criteria is posted  Jaenen6:  Oh  MyMountainDew173:  and only 3 utc teams are eligible  Auto response from Jaenen6:	I will be right back.
