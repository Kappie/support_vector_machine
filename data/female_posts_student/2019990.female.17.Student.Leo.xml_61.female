And then people have entrusted me with well over $1000 for the orphanages and childrens hospital, and I so very frightnened that I will be lose it.  And I'm gettgin nervous, because my stuff is already over the weight limit, and I'm not even done packing.  I still have some shower stuff to pack.  Augh!  I even have to use hal of one of my grandma's suitacases, because the stuff for the Ukrainian people fills more than a suitcase.  And it's heavy.  Sorry I'm stressing all over my blog.  *pets blog* That's not what blogs are for.     So Wonder Woman and I decided that I'm going to be the wierd girl in Pittsburg, because I'm going to sporatically burst into Rent songs.  I really hope the girl my age who's going to the Ukraine has seen Rent.  but that's unlikely.     So I was walking out of my last day of yearbook today, and I found a note on my car.  It was very cute.  Thank's Uma, from Wonder Woman as well.     So Wonder Woman and I were discussing today, as I was picking pictures out of my photo album to take with me, that I have a strange mental depletion.  (I couldn't think of a better word than depletion) I have this problem that after a few weeks I can't recal faces of people. even people I know realy well.  So that's why I bring pictures with me places.  She just couldn't believe that.  But that's how I am. But not to worry, i made sure I have pictures of all my blog readers, I'll never forget you.  Lol I have to keep reminding myself that I'm only leaving for a month.  Oh I'm getting emotional (well as emotional as a cold a soulless person can).  Oh I'm done.  and look at me babble.    Well I'm going to get going.  Wish me luck with the packing dilemas.  Mmmmwah!  A big kiss to all my readers.  Love you all.  Have a wonderufl June even though I'll probably post again soon.  Apparently I'll be in Pittsburg for 10 days befoer we leave, we leave for the Ukraine on the 13.  Good thing some one told me.  See you.
