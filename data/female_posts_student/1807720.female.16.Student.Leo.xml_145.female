I don't find it easy.  I find it the hardest, most difficult, most confusing.  I feel kind of stupid actually for not understanding half of the stuff.  It's stuff we did like way back when, but I don't remember what I learned like five or four years ago.  I need structure and so far, there has been like none for this unit.  It's hard to learn that way and I am extremely worried about the quiz on Thursday.  I don't feel like I really understand anything too well.  Honestly I don't know how I am suppose to learn from a bunch of fill-in-the-blank-handouts.  That is not my thing.  Why does every damn thing have to be hard for me.  WHY CAN'T I JUST BE GOOD AT BIO?!?!  I don't get it, I mean there aren't very many areas I excel it.  Why is it that when I like something I always have to be confused by it.  Grrrrrr.  It's very, very, VERY, frustrating.  You would think I would be used to it by now, but let me tell ya that things never get easier.  They only get harder.  Ok so now I have gotten off my chest how hard I think Bio is right now, I might as well say how fun active living was today.  We did social/ballroom dance which was soooooooooo incredibly fun.  We learned the Cha Cha and Chataranga and some other things.  My partner and I were like so amazing at it!  The instructor always "borrowed" me from my partner to do demonstrations.  It was so fun and not too hard until like one step at the end.  I could do the guys steps and not the girls, lol.  So then Swain was like "ok, I will show you" and like omg I got to dance with him.  Ok so it was like under a minute, but he is seriously hot and good looking and a good dancer.  oh and I went to go see Secret Window tonight, which was good and Johney Depp is amazing.  Tomorrow is also going to be great cause I have rehearsal from 4-6 and well hopefully Bio won't be as stressful tomorrow as it seemed today.
