First an application has to be faxed to the U.S embassy and the reply may come maybe in 3 weeks or longer. But if they “suspect” anything you don’t have the opportunity even to be interviewed.  Once a date is sent through fax for an appointment, we have to go stand in a line from 6 am.  They take you in at 8 am and then you go through a security check.  After the body search and everything, you sit and wait till you are called.  First you have to pay USD 100 to process the application and IF you pass the interview then you pay another USD 96 for the visa issuance.  Well let me also tell you what sort of questions they asked me when I was interviewed. The US officer looked at my grades and then asked me how I am doing in my classes. I said “pretty good”. And then after some basic questions the closing statement was like “Well you know, we don’t want any terrorists in our country..”. I was like “sure..”.  The whole interview procedure is like a cattle show. They might even turn you inside out, just to make sure that we are not terrorists.  Is this how America treats all countries? Oh I forgot to mention the most ironic thing.  One year ago, the FBI had to make a sudden visit to Sri Lanka as two US representatives in the US embassy had issued some visas to some Pakistanis.  According to the newspapers, these US officials were bribed to issue the visas by the Pakistanis.  Anyways the FBI arrested the officials and took them back to the US.  I found this ironic because America is digging their own grave yard.  Well anyway, I hate going to the American Embassy of Sri Lanka, as I feel that it is like going to get a visa to the prison. Air ports in America are also one place where any “Arab” look-a-like doesn’t want to be in.  They go through random checks, and I have noticed I have always been chosen for the random check.  I can imagine how Anna (Book Two – Homeland) must have felt when she was chosen “randomly” for a security check.   Well, I don’t want to be biased and be lambasting the Americans. The Americans have gone through enough already.  I guess people are all tensed and more careful.  Sometimes it is just hard to understand when innocent people be the victim of the harassments.   For a fact I wouldn’t like if someone says “F*** America”.  In the story of “Book Two” it says some Arab kids were screaming cursing Americans.  And some people where happy when America was attacked. This is not fair. We are all in one world.  Why can’t people understand? If one country goes down, it has bad effects on other countries too.  I don’t understand how this world works.
