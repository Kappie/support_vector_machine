I met some truely awesome people, and there were some awesome ppl I didn't get to know and I really wish I did.  It is impossible to say right now everything I did last week, it would take forever but if you have the time and want to hear about it, im me.  I did tons of fun stuff and stepped out of my comfort zone a couple times which was SO worth it!  For those of you who didn't do the swing, you missed out, it was EXTREMELY scary but it was wicked worth it.  I'm seein some people from camp around Concord and Acton, which is awesome, it's helping me to not be too depressed.  I'm still deciding whether to go to the Concord yl or the Nashoba Valley one.  I'll see....
