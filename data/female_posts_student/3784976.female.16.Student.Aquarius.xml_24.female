So we put Saran wrap and tape all over his playstation and controllers.  Then we put Saran wrap and tape on his bed, and wrote on it with whipped cream.  Except for the whipped cream started to melt and ran all over the floor.   Oh, and we also started to hang up his underwear all over the basement.  It was freaking hilarious!!!  Then, when Ben got home, he didn't even see anything.  He is blind sometimes.  When he saw the basement he got soo mad and went and woke our mommy up to tell on me.  She didn't even care!!! Muahaha!!! We got you good Ben.  Watch out, operation fool proof...is on!
