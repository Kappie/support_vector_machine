I got up today at 9:55 AM, I had to be at work at 10:00am, if that tells you anything about this morning. Got up, threw on clothes and out the door with tea in hand.  Finally got more tea, my body thanks me. After drinking mostly Soda for a long time, the Tea just gives me a much greater feeling of contentment, something Soda never does. Got an hour left of work, I've read all my web comics, and I'm kicking myself because I cannot seem to figure out what to write in my Ziggur Blog. I had a pretty good time, despite the fact my buddy Kretais was out most of the day. I spent the entire day out with Guild members on various assualts for my fiance and my pieces to spell quests, and finished the last portion of my soulfire drops. Spent the last part of the night with Kretais farming Sashes, which turned out rather well later in the night.   Tonight I've got more sashes to do, then once the busy work is out of the way(25+ sashes) then I've gotta finish getting my epic sword with it's 5 complete heals. need to also take the time to write up a Zblog and do some work on my Adventure for D  Oh yeah, a follow up on my organization skills. I actually sat down and completed about 5 % of the D origin story. Thinking about posting the collective thoughts of this DD Project on a seperate blog, using it kind of as a white board/forum for comments from readers.   But then again, isn't that just more for me to keep up with? So much to do, so little time in wake filled life to do it. isn't that always the case? maybe that's why I stay up till 4am and get up at 8am at times. 4 hours of sleep, some say it's unhealthy, I say it's the only way I can get anything done. I'll sleep when I'm retired or dead. That's my motto, there's too much in this world to experience or do, to simply spend 1/3 of my life asleep.  Consider it maximizing effeciency. As long as it doesn't affect my work quality, and as long as I can avoid passing out at my desk, I will continue to min/max my life.  For those who do not know the definition of min/max  Min/Max -   Abbv of Minimum/Maximum - origin: Roleplaying Game Slang  - 1. A person who does the minimum to acheive the maximum result. 2. A method of spending the least to get the most. 3. A person who takes advantage of a system to achieve maximum results with the lowest possible side effects.
