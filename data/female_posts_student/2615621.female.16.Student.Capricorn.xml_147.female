DAMMIT BITCH, THATS MY POSTER MY BEST FRIEND WON FOR ME. I DONT CARE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT  and  b-GAVE HER FUCKIN BOYFRIENDS GRANDSON ZACK ALL MY MOVIES OUTTA MY ROOM..NOW THIS INCLUDES MY SESASME STREET COLLECTION, GUMBY, LION KING, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT, AND MANY OTHER CHILDHOOD FAVORITES THAT I STILL FUCKING WATCH TO THIS DAY. I OWN LIKE EVERY DAMN DISNEY MOVIE EVER MADE AND I WATCH THEM ON RAINY FUCKIN DAYS. AND ONCE MORE..DONT TOUCH MY SHIT AND DONT GIVE IT TO UR BF'S GRANDKID. THOSE ARE MY MOVIES, MOVIES WHICH I KEEP UNDER MY TV AND VCR IN A NEAT LIL STACK, WHERE I KNOW WHERE EACH ONE IS.   dont fuck with my stuff or i'll fuckin kick ur ass. but shes my mom...so im going to wait until i have my graham colton concert tickets and then freak the fuck out on her. :D ...im breathing...im breathing...i want my fuckin movies.   my aunt is over an hour late to fuckin pick me up too..my dad woke me up at 6:50am to get ready cuz she was gonna be here at 9:00am. and it takes her about an hour and a half to drive here if there isnt any traffic. well..i get up...i pack my shit...i get dressed...im all ready. and shes suppose to call at 8ish and tell me shes on the way. but she never called..i figured she just forgot to call but would show up at 9. she decides to call at 9 and say she's headed my way...dammit..i could have slept in until at least 8 fuckin 30. but no. thats too much to ask him sure. so not only did i get maybe 5hrs of sleep but now im tired as hell sittin here waiting for this lady to show up and get me and i dont even wanna go! and of all things..caroline went to the ER this morning at like 3:30am cuz she was spendin the nite with a friend that has a little dog that stays inside and shes allerigic to some dogs and broke out and swelled up. it didnt stop until she went to the hosptial and got some shot. and thats not enough to keep me at my dads and let lil caroline rest?? no dammit its not. lets make julia go spend a few days with people shes related to but doesnt know and then lets give all her damn disney movies away and her poster..hmm..sounds like im starring in that shitty movie.   *much love and FUCK*..wow that felt good.
