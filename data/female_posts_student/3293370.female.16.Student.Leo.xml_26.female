But hey, you can't have everything right? Mark and Sara came to pick me up ... thanks guys, you're awesome!   So tired. So sore. Jammed my finger before lunch today and it's still swollen like mad. I can't bend it for shit.  Birthday on Wednesday. Apparently I'm going somewhere tomorrow with one of the girls from work to do something for my birthday since she won't be in town that day. Something about taking a picture? I don't get it. Anyway, hopefully it will be fun. But Jen's awesome and we always have fun together, so yeah. Whee. I need sleep, like nobody's business.  PS I could really go for a slurpee. Right now.  Yup.
