We continue to benefit from his views, so if his wife is not all right, he is not going to be able to focus. From what i read, Mrs Lee took care of the family while Mr Lee took care of the nation. any married man will tell you that that takes a lot of sacrifice. cost of medical treatment for Mrs Lee? At this time we should be asking, "Mrs Lee, are you feeling better?"  --  The Straits Times   It is ironical that some Singaporeans should question the integrity of SM Lee. it is indeed very sad. sigh. hopefully both SM and Mrs Lee recovers speedily.
