I am going to try and swim an extra lap a day with the hopes of building up my cardio.  I know that losing weight will be a long time battle for me, but it feel sgood to be on the road to doing something about it.  Thanks to my sister Leila, I think I can do this.  She keeps me motivated and helps when I am feeling down.  I have been depressed altely, keeping it to myself.  I feel empty, but not.  I feel broken.  I feel lost in a world full of confusion.  Show me the path to happiness, I will follow you closely...then reality sets in and I realize my own happiness depneds on me and not where others lead me to.  It is where I lead myself.  Change starts on the inside and works its way out.
