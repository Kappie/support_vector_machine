Sunday papers are the best, there is so much to read and I love how they separate it into different sections. I always read them in the same order; Sports, Variety, Star Mag, Education, Fit for Life, then the main paper. I'm so thrilled Maria Sharapova won at Wimbledon this year, I was just waiting for someone to dethrone Serena Williams. I mean, hello?? Give someone else a chance. Maria is one tough chick, and she's only 17. *whistles* I'm pretty amused by her screams on court.   Tonight, or should I say, tomorrow morning, is the final of Euro 2004. It's between Greece and Portugal. I'm banking on  Greece  to lift the title. They're the underdogs here, and I've gotten over them beating beloved  Spain . Also, Portugal are the hosts, so they have a certain advantage, so that's kinda unfair right??   Other Sports news, Alonso is in pole position for today's race! Yay! Go Renault!   Anyway, I watched  Malaysian Idol  today. I dunno whether to be amused or embarrased by some of the contestants. Caught a glimpse of my friend Shih-Ying on tv, wonder if she made it? There was this guy who really sucked, Kenny I think that's his name, he was in Penang when he sang To Where You Are by Josh Groban. He sucked still today, he's so gay. Yuckz. Pukez. There was one girl who was pretty good, she was beautiful too, and another who sounded like Fantasia.   Lunch today was awesome, went to my fave eatery, Woods, for a healthy, organic, microbiotic meal of spinach pasta in soy dressing. Haha. I know it sounds awful right? Well, to those who are not used it anyway. But once you acquire the taste for this kind of cuisine, it's really delicious. Plus, it's healthy. Not much sin there. Lol.   I'm really exhausted chasing the baby around. Oh gosh. If only he can be still for one second, that's all I'm asking for. Sigh. Am actually glad he's going back tonight. I dunno how much more of this babysitting I can stand. I haven't been able to get much work done, only did some maths and attempted to do LAN project. Oh well.   I've been trying my best to change For things to go back to the way they were But we both know better That we're almost over this time We try to fight it, we try to defy it I have a feeling it's too late  How do we turn back time? When your heart isn't next to mine anymore? What are we trying to prove? When there's nothing we can do No, we're running out of time  Maybe we've grown aprat We try but we're going separate ways It's like you've changed And I'm surprised that I have too   We try to fight it, we try to defy it We both know that it's too late  How do we turn back time? When your heart isn't next to mine anymore What are we trying to prove? When there's nothing we can do No, we're running out of time
