Thank you Bethie for colouring it up      This should be fun, and even though I smin in a two piece tank top and shorts set I'm still nervous about my Kung Fu people (as Bethie calls them) seeing me in my bathing suit. I plan on working out through the school year this year, so that should help with next summer but grrrrrrr, any how.     Well enough of that I must be off to the lake and off the computer before death arrives. Ta!
