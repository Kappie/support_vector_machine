HOW FUCKIN LOW IS THAT??? AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, SHE SAID IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE AND WHEN CONFRONTED SHE DENIES IT, OF COURSE SHE'S NOT GOING TO ADMIT SHE'S WRONG. I AM ALSO TIRED OF BEING BLAMES FOR EVERY SHITTY THING THAT HAPPENS AROUND ME OR TO ME, IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T WANT ME AROUND ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SAY SO AND I'LL LEAVE; THERE'S NO NEED TO GET NASTY OR RUDE, AND YES I AM REAL RUDE TO THE ONES I DISLIKE. I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE THAT SAY REAL MEAN SHIT AND THEN THEY WONDER WHY I'M SUCH A BITCH, NOW YOU KNOW. FIGHT ROOM PEOPLE ARE A JOKE, THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE TURMOIL IN THEIR LIVES AND THEY WILL GO WAY TO FAR JUST TO FUCK SOMEBODY OVER. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN THEIR SHIT THROWN OUT THERE AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE THEY TRUSTED THE WRONG PERSON, LUCKILY THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED TO ME PROBABLY BECAUSE I TRUST NO ONE. TONS OF PEOPLE HAVE PRETENDED TO BE MY "FRIEND" AND IT ALWAYS TURNS OUT THEY'RE ANYTHING BUT FRIENDS, AND FOR THE RECORD I DO NOT HAVE ANY "FIGHT ROOM FRIENDS". I REALLY HATE DRAMA, SOME PLACES ARE FULL OF DRAMA, I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE FIGHT ROOMS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ALL IN FUN; BUT THE REAL TRUTH IS AS I LEARNED, IT'S ALL FULL OF CLICKY PEOPLE IN THEIR CLICKS AND THEY RARELY LET NEW PEOPLE IN OR OUT. I USED TO TRY AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH THESE ASSHOLES AND THEY ALL BURNED ME, ALL THE THREE YEARS I HAVE BEEN VENTURING IN FIGHT ROOMS THEY STILL CALL ME RETARDED. I GUESS SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE, BUT IF THEY WANT TO BE LIKE THAT THEN FUCK 'EM-TO HELL WITH THEM. IT'S REALLY KINDA FUNNY, ALL THIS TIME BY BLOG HAS BEEN UP NOT A SINGLE SOUL HAS LEFT A COMMENT-YOU GUYS ARE NO FUN.
