Such a remarkable actress. Finally found the long awaited the polyphonic ringtone of Hard Fate themesong. Ringtone can be found in "http://loveflorachan.com", the best site dedicated to Flora Chan.   Hope all is well with Flora who is at Heng Dian filming her new series. Can't wait to watch it.. :)  Still many more of Flora's series that I haven't watch. Like the Family Man and A Case of Misadventure. Will watch them as soon as I have some free time!
