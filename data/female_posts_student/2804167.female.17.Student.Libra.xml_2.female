'what are you doing, jen?' asked the shadow maker. i looked up against the sun to see my own mother, come to visit, and my younger brother, not yet in school. he wore his puffy down coat that made him look like a fat blue marshmallow, stupid with his red rosy cheeks and button round eyes.  'i donno,' i think i said, inexplicably embarrassed to be caught alone at my solitary game. i straightened one of the scraps of ice self-consciously, still half kneeling on the asphault.  it was so clear and bright and blue that day.
