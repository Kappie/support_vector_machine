My throat isn't as sore, which is good I suppose. I'm not doing anything at all this weekend, except possibly going to set construction on Monday. I really don't want to, but I have to in order to get my Thespian points. Meh. I woke up at 7:30 today. Yuck! I hate being sick. Anyways, this whole new director situation is just a mess. I'm really disappointed in the way everyone is handling this. People are making this way more difficult than it needs to be. So much for a smooth transition.
