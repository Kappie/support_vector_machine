There were things I did callously when I was in high school, that I am pretty darn sure messed up my little bro. As such any reference to me having a problem, where no problem exists, when said to my brother, runs the risk of him reliving things that I will die before I allow. Ch. is my only sibling and as much as he probably would prefer otherwise, I think of him as my best friend. To do anything or say anything, that could bring back the symptoms of distress Ch. used to display, will ONLY be answered by unbridled anger on my part, and to a point I hope you would almost expect that of the eldest. I am defensive, because once upon a time I brought things upon him, no 12 yr old should deal with. Therefore anything alluding to my actions then, with reference to my actions now, will recieve anger because they are wholly untrue. Please do not come to me, as a recent email said, and claim that such statements were made off-the-cuff or jokingly. This is not something that can or should be joked about and I fail to see why anyone would think they would be received, especially in light of the circumstances as funny. I am not laughing. I actually refused to talk to my mother for two days over this. That indicates in my mind that something is awry rather than humorous.
