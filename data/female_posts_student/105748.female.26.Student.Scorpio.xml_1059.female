You can enter your pledge online or you can just email me your address and pledge amount and I will just add it to my pledge sheet.. What do you think?  BTW, I really like Buzznet!  I can't wait to get a camera phone so I can start mo blogging.. But it'll be August before I get a new phone.. I just have a handmedown T300 right now with a detachable camera but I want a T610 or my dream phone, which I'll prob never be able to afford in this lifetime, the P900!   I am waiting until August bec that's when Brian gets a free one from his work.. I am cheap and do not want to have to pay for it.
