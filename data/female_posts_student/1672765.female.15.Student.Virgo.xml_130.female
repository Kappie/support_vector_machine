I will hopefully put this on amazon.com when it comes out on video, but until then it will be here...I titled it:   It could have been so much better    [3 1/2 stars] I don't know where to start so I'll just dive right in. Some of the acting I didn't like. Sorry for being picky or whatever but it had this feel of an indie film that got big. The reports and news-anchormen and bystanders, I realize they aren't that important but still, you have to pay attention to the little things because they amount to a lot. I didn't like alot of the portrayl of people either. Alot of people's reactions to certain things I just couldn't get around. I just thought, "Nobody would react like that - that's so unrealistic."   Something happens (I don't want to spoil it) but it was a little twist/subplot - whatever you want to call it - it wasn't necessary. I mean, really, these people are in an ice age and you throw that in the movie - that's too much.   The little romantic subplot was alright, I normally hate romance in action/disaster films because but I have to admit that Donnie Darko (that's how I know him as...don't know his name)...I don't know...I like him...call me a sucker, whatever. But some of it was so silly - "You gotta tell her how you feel." Please. This isn't A Walk to Remember.  Now, don't get me wrong, it's a good movie and definetly worth seeing. I loved the idea behind it and alot of things that happened were great. I laughed at the parts that were funny because they were. Major props for that.   Somethings were a little predictable, I, myself, would have loved if it ended a different way but I wanted Lord of the Rings to end with Frodo keeping the ring and taking everything over so some may say I'm mad.  The thing that leaves me the most dissappointed was when it ended and the lights of the cinema came on and I looked around at all the people getting up, all the people going out to their SUVs, gas-guslers, to blow out their AC's at home, whatever. Just as the movies closed, impressing upon us all that this could really happen, our environment is in danger, we all should be doing something about it, I wonder just how many people care. I saw all the people going to see it - mostly teens, high schoolers just out to go see a movie, a place to make out, to goof off. I just wish more people would pay attention. I wonder if I'm too cynical, maybe these kids really are interested in global warming and the conservation of our natural resources. Maybe.
