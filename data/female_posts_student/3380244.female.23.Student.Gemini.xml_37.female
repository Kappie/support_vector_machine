"oh my god! i'm so sorry, my foot slipped off the breaks! oh my god!" my little saturn was at a complete stop at a redlight when his huge truck slammed into the back of me, and i went forward and hit the car in front of me! we sure got bumped around. so, most importantly... everyone is alive and okay. and actually, the only car damage that was done was to his big honkin' truck! which i find slightly amusing... so many people buy suv's or huge trucks because they feel safe in them, but in the accident yesterday, the huge vehicle is the one that had the most damage... his whole front bumper was smashed in and my saturn went off without a scratch. HA! because i've been in a car accident prior to this one, and have had neck/back problems since my other accident, i went right to the ER yesterday to get x-rays because i was hurting right away. x-rays came out fine and my only diagnosis is "cervical strain" which is fine- could have been a lot worse- but i am SO sore and uncomfortable!!! it's more my upper back than anything else... it huuuuuuurts!    i wanted to share a story though about the ER yesterday. so- i  really really really  hate being in hospitals, and especially emergency rooms! this probably isn't common knowledge about myself, but i don't know anyone out there that really loves  the place. so doug came with me to the emergency room, i thought because he was in the accident with me and was immediately complaining about back pain as well that he'd also get checked out. we drove separately to the ER (yes, i drove myself there)... so imagine this... i'm signing in and filling out paperwork when they put a neck brace on me and put me in a wheel chair. it looked a bit dramatic, but my blood pressure was sky high and that's probably standard for neck pain. so i'm sitting there (unhappy and scared, because i  HATE  emergency rooms) with my neck brace in a wheel chair when doug leans in, kisses me and says "alright... i'm gonna get going, my softball game starts in half an hour. i'll call you later to see how you are, okay babe?" i was in such shock that i couldn't even say anything! to be in an emergency room anyway scares the heck out of me, but to be LEFT in one all by myself?!!!! oh my god! i freaked out and demanded that i was wheeled outside so i could use my cell phone to "phone a friend." i called my melissa (my cousin's fience, and my new roommate starting in a few weeks) and she drove over in a flash and saved the day. THANK YOU, MELISSA!!! so i find it humorous that the guy that everyone thought was soooooo sweet and cared about me sooooooo much actually left me there in the ER by myself. i realize i was mostly fine, and i wasn't dying or bleeding, but c'mon.... have a heart!
