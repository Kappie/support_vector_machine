It deals with all different aspects of brain and behavior. A recent one was about brain chemistry (plus environment) and violent behavior.  It's amazing that you can look at a PET scan of a "normal" brain and that of a person with a history of anti-social behavior and see the differences as clearly as you can see the differences in people's faces. But what does one do with those scans?  A defense attorney actually admitted a PET scan of his client's brain in a murder case and got his sentence reduced. Reduced from death to life in prison, so it isn't as if murderers will now be set free. Most people already assume there are differences between most brains and a murderer's brain, don't they? Even if it doesn't start out that different the act of murder must change the structure of the brain. Changes occur all the time with lesser causes.  The topic moved to the possibility of using PET scans to identify which teens might be capable of mass murder. The question is what you do about it if an abnormal brain scan is found. My question is why would the scan be done at all unless there is already some disturbing behavior. And would the information be shared with schools? That wouldn't make much sense. If psychiatrists aren't sure what to make of the results, how could teachers ? It certainly has potential as a tool in a person't psychiatric treatment.  Another thing that blows my mind is why anyone would find a scan necessary to identify an Eric Harris or a Dylan Kleebold. I knew which ones in my high school had the potential. I don't understand how anyone can miss it. You don't have to live with these kids or have them in your class for 8 months to see which kids need help.  They mentioned an incident with one of the "school shooters" that happened a few months before his rampage. In the middle of class one day this kid suddenly shouted Damn these voices in my head! The kid was sent to the principal's office and a note was sent home for his parents to sign. He had to answer the question What could I do differently in that situation in the future. He wrote "not say damn." Parent and teacher signed and that was the end of it.
