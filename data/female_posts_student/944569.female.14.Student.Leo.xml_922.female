I am done finally...I woke up at 9:15 a.m. Started working at around 10:30 a.m. Stopped at 3:30 p.m. took a break for aboout and hour...started working until...10:10 p.m.  I am done all my homework..and i wouked for 7 hours straight..i am crazy.....I started sticking pens in my hair insstead of a apencil case...it actually is useful isntead of looking around for pens on your desk.  I advise girls to use this.  and boys with really long hair....I had to have 3 cups of Ginseng Tea (helps stress. it really works) Omg...And the verdict is....I will ace that computer quiz!i actually understand computers..yes, it is boring but i understand it...information goes in the and comes out either through a printer or "le stockage"..its a whole cycle...i am so proud of myself.  I AM GENIUS!
