BHS was ranked #298.  So multiply 1000 times 50, plus and extra like 2000 schools for Texas and California.  That means that we're 298/54000ish.  Which means BHS is in the top 5% of U.S. schools, meaning SCHOLARSHIPS!!!!  Not only that, but we were the only Tennessee school, both public and private, on the list.  I think that means YAY BHS!!!  and I'm not exactly one for school spirit either.  I went and borrowed all the books we're supposed to read for AP from the library.  Have I started on them?  No way, I''m not that motivated.  Anyway, I'm going to my grandmother's house to try to help calm my cousin down a bit about this baby thing.  Or at least help her realize that she really  is  having a baby.  I don't think it's fully sunk in yet.  But it should be fun...er, interesting.  I'll still be on the blog and on my e-mail and stuff though, so nothing should be changing, but if you need me, call my cell, and if you don't have the cell, then call Abby or Liz and they'll tell you cause I'm not thrilled about the idea of giving my phone number out on the internet.  Anyway, um, that's about it.  I sat on my bum today and did a whole bunch of nothing, so there isn't anything else to say.  I'll let you know when something interesting happens.  Someone get in a fight or something so I can at least be entertained for a while.  I need entertaining badly.  Ok, that's it, it's movie night, so I gotta go.  It's Whit's night to pick, so it could be interesting...
