No one ever comments on my blog anymore. :( it's sad. I havent been on the computer which is saying lots since I have been at grammas and the computer there is 100 times faster than this one. which I am just learning now. I honestly think that jim should just fucking re-install the whole windows xp. Or something. I dunno, just clear it out and get rid of all the  stupid pop up things that wont go the fuck away. bah, I wish I was as molerat. I dont even know what a molerat is but....I'd rather be one. OMF! there was alot of guyses there. and one had REALLY pretteh hair! I shottied him. But he looked like he was 13 or so. Well he looked young. But he was kinda hot anyways.
