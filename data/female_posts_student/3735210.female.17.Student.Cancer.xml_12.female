Leave your things behind 'Cause it's all going off without you Excuse me too busy you're writing a tragedy These mess-ups You bubble-wrap When you've no idea what you're like  So, let go Jump in Oh well, what you waiting for? It's all right 'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown So, let go Just get in Oh, it's so amazing here It's all right 'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown  It gains the more it gives And then advances with the form So, honey, back for more Can't you see that all the stuff's essential? Such boundless pleasure We've no time for later Now you can wait You roll your eyes We've twenty seconds to comply So, let go Jump in Oh well, what you waiting for? It's all right 'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown  So, let go Just get in  Oh, it's so amazing here It's all right 'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
