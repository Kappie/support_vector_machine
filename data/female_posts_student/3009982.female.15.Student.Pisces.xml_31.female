Manyak manyak hal telah berlaku dalam minggu ini. I feel pressured because a particular friend demands extreme attention from me. Sorry, I didn't mean to make her sound like baby whining for milk every two hours.. I think she just needs someone to talk and whine to, for entertainment, comfort, that sorta thing.  I got sick of it sometime last week. And I complained to SQ by smsing her. Haha SQ's response was funny you know. She didn't dare be direct to me. This was how it went: SQ: 'well, erm maybe you should tell her to give you your own space..'  and I said  M-R: "No, can't do that cos' I know she'd feel hurt" SQ: 'oh just tell her subtly la. should be fine wan' ....then I didn't reply till a few hours saying: M-R: "Hey, sorry I complained just now. I shouldn't. I should just bear with her, since thats what friends are for, to be there for each other." SQ: 'Haih, you know the answer adee wat. Nolar, you sounded so annoyed mah. So you should learn now..'  I've been puzzled why she didn't tell it straight to my face. She's pretty close, my spiritual accountability partner/friend actually, and she knew I wouldn't get hurt. And YET she just wouldn't say it. Why?   Talking bout indirectness, AL asked me a REAL direct question. You see, for quite some time AL had changed. I mean, like character change? Both AL and I are part of a group of friends- not exactly a clique but sorta, we do stuff together. And when AL changed, everyone in that 'group' noticed it and began talking about it. Nobody questioned her bout it, of course.. Nobody does. Come to think of it now, WHY? Why didn't we, as a group of AL's close friends, go up to her and ask why she was behaving differently... Anyway, back to topic.. That change thing was some months ago, she seems back to normal (?) if I may use the word.  And yesterday, AL and PK were talking in a corner, I joined them and listened. Suddenly AL asked me "Have you ever thought, at one time, that you didn't know me? Like I behaved differently, wasn't the AL you knew?" Wow, talk about hitting it right on the spot. Well, of course the answer is yes. PK was there as well, I knew her answer is yes. Strangely, she answered 'Not really', while I said 'Yes'. We kinda answered answered at the same time, and when PK heard my answer she looked at me but to be honest, I ignored her.  And then, it was time to go home, AL said we'd talk another time.   What puzzled me was that PK was one of those who  strongly  agreed that AL had changed just a few months back. And here she was saying 'Not really.' ?!?  Was she trying not to hurt AL's feelings when she said 'not really'? Or had she forgotten what had happened or.. life is full of stupid questions like this. And why am I the one who is asking?   Haha, that reminds me of what Alicia calls "Children's Politics". Not exactly politics, but what perhaps what politicians do? No, I wasn't referring to my case, it just you know, REMINDED me of it.  You know, I got lift back from Alicia after Church because the others had Worship Ministry meeting. Jonathan and Elaina were in the car as well. Duh. It's so interesting to see Jonathan and Alicia talk. Haha this sounds so absurd but I'm serious. They're so brotherly/sisterly in love, if I may. Ok ok, maybe  best friends  is a better word. Whatever, it's wonderful. =)  Nice to have your sibling as a best friend. Mine's great, just not my best friend. Probably cos' he's 7 years older than me. We can joke and fool around, no doubt, but nay, we can't talk talk. We do not go through the same stuff, he's so much more mature and I could never understand him. And me? I have so much nonsense on the surface he'd die of the stench before he got deeper. Is that how life is?  Speaking of my brother and our level of closeness, he's coming back this Wednesday. YAy!! M-R, say hello to lovely food, stupid jokes, and some dvds?  =D   *waves!!!!*
