Hmm, a little about me. Not much to say, really. I live in Carson, California, I'm female, White, single, and turning 18 next Sunday ;) . I have brown hair and play the glockenspiel (which isn't as nerdy as the name sounds), and I love jazz music and old-school rock. Right now I'm eating a chicken and fettuccine alfredo TV dinner. That's about it, I think.  I should probably send out a big hearty THANK YOU to Dusty Scott, the criminally attractive and witty author of Pork Tornado and Salami Tsunami, for giving me this whole new blogging opportunity and for bringing me out of a massive pity-party. This is how it happened, Dusty: I was having an unbearably crappy day today. I had horrible nightmares last night, and actually woke up with a knot in my stomach this morning, which I thought was impossible. It was my last day of work today, and while I didn't like the job very much, the $10 an hour was great, so having to quit depressed me. I also found out that my "friends" went off to Magic Mountain without even saying anything to me. My mom has been going through some sort of emotional crisis lately, is depressed most of the time, and cries at the drop of a hat. She also doesn't get a paycheck in August (being a teacher and all), so money is very, very tight. All that, coupled with the fact that the kitchen faucet broke and I have to wash the dishes in the bathroom, amounted to making my day one massive suck.  Then I read your Atlanta Journal blog about the crazy things you do in the office, Dusty, and laughed 'till I cried. It was the first big laugh I'd had in almost a month. I went to post a comment thanking you, but found I had to sign up if I didn't want to post anonymously. This blog is a result of that. Thank you so much, Dusty. You're my hero. I'd send you cookies, but you'd probably prefer cash, and I don't love you *that* much. ;)  Moving on...    ATTENTION ALL NON-FILIPINO GIRLS WHO ARE ATTRACTED TO FILIPINO GUYS:    Go out and buy a Filipino Club T-Shirt. Right now.  Being out of other clean shirts this morning, I wore my high school Filipino club T-shirt to work and was too lazy to do laundry when I got home. (Mind you, I'm not Filipino. I was conned into joining the club by my friends [the club consisted of seven Mexicans, one Chinese girl, me, and three actual Filipinos] and ended up loving it.) Later, I went to Albertson's with my dad to get something for dinner, and while I was there THREE cute Filipino guys asked me about my shirt. They were all impressed that I know how to dance the Tinikling, and I had very nice conversations with each of them. Now, I'm not particularly attracted to Filipino dudes, but it got me thinking that that could be a great market to corner. A Filipino girl wearing a Filipino shirt is nothing out of the ordinary, but a White girl (or any other non-Filipino girl) wearing one attracts attention. 'Why is she wearing that?' people wonder. It's a great conversation starter, and could be used as an ice-breaker at parties. Not only could you get hit on, but people will think you're culturally-sensitive. I might just start making T-shirts.  I have more stupid stuff to talk about, but this post is too long as it is. I'll save some material for tomorrow. It would be funny if someone actually *read* one of my blogs for once.  Today's word is:  Dilettante   dil·et·tante  n. pl. dil·et·tantes, also dil·et·tan·ti  1. A dabbler in an art or a field of knowledge.  (see amateur)  2. A lover of the fine arts; a connoisseur.   adj.  1. Superficial; amateurish.
