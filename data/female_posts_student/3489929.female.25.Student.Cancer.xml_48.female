I was run ragged this morning because Posh did not show up until 12:30, and everyone was bombarding me with their shit. So when she came in, I snapped at her and she snapped back and we kinda had a tiff.  I took her aside before lunch and apologized, and explained that I was feeling stressed. Then at 1:30, she came in the office where I was sitting reading a book at my desk.  "Come with me! I have something that will make you smile."  Okay. So I follow her into customer service, and she points out the window... and I burst out laughing.  Rebel had overshot her parking space and had landed on the side of the hill, almost under the building, and could not get her car back onto terra firma.  I almost peed myself, it was so funny. As I told Jefe, "You always wished we had underground parking here..."
