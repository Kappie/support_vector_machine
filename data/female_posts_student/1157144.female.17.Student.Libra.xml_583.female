When I see you guys there, I will go over and chat, but otherwise...  I'm reading! Not hanging out on Friday night though.  I'm reading the 5th Harry Potter, duh! This is really cool for Ryan.  I have been to plenty of those types of things.  But, one thing I dont' get...  eulogy?  of who?  who died? BTW, i'm calling B now to see when they think the line will get big.  Once I find out, I will blog it so we don't go too early, but I still think I will be there @ noon.
