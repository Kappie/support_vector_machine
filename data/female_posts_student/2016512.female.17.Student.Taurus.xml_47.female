"i've decided that i really like thursdays. i mean the only thing i do is dance for an hour after school. so it makes me feel like i'm active but i'm really not doing much at all. today was fun because i'm so tired that everything is just 10x more funny than it actually is. i mean i was laughing like crazy all day. from mr. barton's hip rendition of "Boom Dynamite" to the squealing in the hallway like a little 8th grader. you could not wipe the smile off my face today.  'the reason i'm so tired is because i finished a book last night and when i finish books i normally push myself to keep reading at night. so the night before i stayed up till 1:30am and then last night i was up till 12am. it's all caught up to me and now i'm struggling. the book was okay, kind of disappointing. but now that i'm done i can move on with my book reading plan. you see, i've accumulated a lot of books over the summer but i was always reading other books when i got them so i've finally finished them and can now read the new purchases...starting with Main Street by Sinclair Lewis.  'other news...PLANKY HANKIES beat HUMMERTOWN! it was really really cold but really fun to go see them. i rode the fan bus with Ambrosious. She was kind of mad about me getting window seat and her not be able to sleep because i move and stuff. i also beat her at slap jack *sorry* ...so the Planky Hankies are off to the Metrodome on saturday! it's not going to be cold! i'm excited!  if they win on friday they are going to play on the day of the recital. so i won't be able to go to that. oh well i'm sure we'll be listening to the radio.  oh yeah!  me and Lizabef O. are doing a duet this year. i talked mom into doing one. so it's supposed to be a comedy character number. we're not sure what song yet so if anyone has any ideas let me know. so far people want us to do chicago or i think spring time for hitler would be fun. also maybe next year me, pip, and tom could do Two Ladies. it would be a lot of fun. if only i could persuade pip."  well that's about it since i was so rudely interrupted last time i blogged. i don't think i can go much longer so g'bye  I Think I Broke Something, -Betso
