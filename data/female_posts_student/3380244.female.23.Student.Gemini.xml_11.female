(sounds like, "have you taken your medication today?"  haha)  i used to get so annoyed when he'd say that.  but it's true.  working out is my release, i gather up all these negative feelings and it affects my mood.  when i was in spinning class today, i felt like a superhero!  i worked my butt off, and it felt soooooo amazing!!!  i don't even know where all the energy came from, but there it was.  hooray for spinning!  i sent out resumes and cover letters for some jobs today... i'm actually feeling pretty hopeful about it!  the jobs i applied for sound super cool- and definitely something which will inspire me.  i'm super picky about jobs, i've realized.  it's quite a commitment and i want to make sure i know what i'm getting myself into.  i'm looking for something that will be inspiring, a job that will be motivational, a job i won't "get" too quickly, a job where i actually want to wake up in the morning and go to, as well as a job where i can help people.  lets just hope i find this amazing position!  :)  ciao.
