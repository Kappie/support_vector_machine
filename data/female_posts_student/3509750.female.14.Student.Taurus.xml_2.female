Kristina, I am so glad that we have been able to be friends for these two years, and I am so glad that we have gone this whole time without a BIG fight. Ruthie, I am so so so glad that we became best friends this year. You and Kristina know me like no one else does, and that's what makes you two so so so special to me. I know that you're leaving soon Ruthie, but we will keep in touch and there's no way that me and Kristina will forget about you! I love you tqo and NOTHING will ever change that!!  Bye
