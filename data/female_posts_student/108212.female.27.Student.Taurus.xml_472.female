But the movie never gets it on. Oh sure, these kids will marry at the close of the film (they have to -- we know they're destined to be parents to Luke and Leia), but their skins never close and wrestle. Somehow, in 2002, George Lucas is still a virgin, and he wants his audience in the same stricken state.      urlLink Hmm...  What an interesting take on the movie..
