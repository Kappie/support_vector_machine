Today I went and got my hair cut, and my hair dresser used some sorta shampoo to make my hair redder. It owns.  Some people don't realize that the point of life is to  live  it. The way I see it, we should live and be crazy  now , because, what happens later when we regret all those missed opportunities?  Mistakes are part of the beauty of life. Live with no regrets.  Bye bye you crazies!!!!!
