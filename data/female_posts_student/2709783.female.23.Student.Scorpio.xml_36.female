Okay, so I was really wearing a robe, sitting on the faux leather loveseat, eating Kraft Cheese and Macaroni.  But the concept is the same.  Something about my recent slackerness finally overstepped its bounds, and in the past few hours I have washed and detailed the pickup, started on the months' worth of laundry that has been stashed in my closet (I tend to buy new clothes when everything I own is dirty), and scoured my bathroom, as best I know how.  Domestic duties are not my strong suit, as evidenced by this exchange between Darby and myself:  Darby:  So I was cleaning the baseboards, and he says....  Me:  What's a baseboard?  I think that's what they're called.  Anyway, as a reward to myself for being productive, I got my nails done (I actually did this yesterday, as a kind of pre-reward, but that's not important).  While I was at the nail place, my suspicions that Southeastern Asians are going to make all of us lazy Americans their slaves were reaffirmed, as well as several random conspiracy theories I've been harboring.  First, it goes without saying that the people who do my nails constantly mock their customers without our knowledge.  Despite speaking conversational English, they insist on making comments in their native language and then laughing, while I sit there and smile, hoping they will not grind my finger completely off.  This reminds me of the linguistic empathy that Mom suddenly learned when I took her to Mexico for the first time.  "Now I know why all the hired help just smiles and nods when you tell them to do something."  This was just after the conductor on the train asked her where we were staying, and she smiled and nodded yes.  Also, I think the nail techs are making me their drug mule by mixing illegal substances into my manicure, then removing them when I return.  I'm not sure what purpose this serves, except to force me into possessing illegal drugs and maybe keep all of their operational materials away from their "salon" front, in case of a raid.  I say this because the smell of the stuff they put on my nails is exactly like the smell from when a meth lab caught on fire in Laguna Park and stunk up Lake Whitney for three days.     Finally, as I sat there and watched the news, a story came on about the  urlLink spontaneous combustion of Hondas , which I can only attribute to the plot to take over the U.S.  They have tried to blame it on the mechanics, but I have my doubts.  Thank God I don't have a foreign vehicle, and if I did, I think I would go with a German one.  They've already had their shot at world dominance.
