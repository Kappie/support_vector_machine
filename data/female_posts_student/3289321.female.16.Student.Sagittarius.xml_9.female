Oh well, I need to be getting in shape for volleyball season..:)  Lyrics that I have stuck in my head:  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend You could cut ties with all the lies That you've been living in And, if you do not want to see me again I would understand  That's a good song..and really easy to play on guitar too, might I add.  Gonna go rest up so I can hit the pavement in the morning. :)  Later  >
