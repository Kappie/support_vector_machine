Then I have the stress of all the fights I have with my mom. Everything is just so hard. My goal is to lose 25 lbs by August 25th. and lost 10 more by september 11,(when i go school shopping) I am not going to put myself through the pain of getting clothes that are bigger than i want, or putting them on and nothing looks good. for once i would like to feel good about my appearance. The main reason I am trying so hard this time is i want the lead in the musical this year and I am not going to be FAT in front of hundreds of people. Just not going to happen. Done Deal!
