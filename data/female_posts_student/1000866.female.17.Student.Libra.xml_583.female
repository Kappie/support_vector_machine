I'm having to do a ton of errands and stuff today. A lot more than I expected. Plus, Patrick and I actually planned to talk on the phone. :) That'll be so fun if we get to. Although, I bet I'll make a complete fool of myself.  Anyway, more errands to do. Gotta go pick up some supplies for tomorrow. :)
