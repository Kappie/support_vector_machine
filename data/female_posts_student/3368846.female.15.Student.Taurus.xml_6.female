Well as of today.. theres no major drama except the fact that IM MOVING IN LiKE 69 DAYZ :(  Well School was.. ok I guess.. Then after school I went to the baseball game with Britt and Wayne.. that was cool..  After the game I Talked to my buddy who I havent talked to in like FOREVER.. so Im happy.. lol..  Um... yea... im kinda spacy today like I cant think about ne thing cuz I get distracted wayyyy to easily.   Yea well.. I am soo happy... IDK my life is like perfect.. except moving :( but I am trying realy hard to not let it come up in my mind because I dont wanna focus on it anymore.   Well Nate and Kelli are gonna get married in December! and I get to be in the wedding! YaY so I'll be heading up there for a lil bit during christmas break unless they decide to do it down here at the breakers... I am soo happy for them because I kno how much I cried when I found out about his cancer but her.. I mean I couldnt imagine being with sum1 for 3 years then one day outta the blue finding out they have cancer :( I wouldnt be able to live. One of the hardest things about it is that Nate JUST Turned 17 Like April 10th.  If sumthin goes wrong IDK wut I will do... I mean we arent like brother n sister like me n Bryan but we are pretty close. Wow.. I just think about wut I would do if I found out Wayne had cancer *knocks on wood*.. WHOA.. I wouldnt be able to live...   Yep well.. I still have yet to do the dishes :x Lol.. So Im gonna do sum homework then do them..   Love Yaz!
