Have you earhtlings out there wondered why we can only remember things that don't strecth far back from the day we were born but instead only start at maybe 3 to 4 years of age. Surely, a memory as horrenduous as coming out from dear mommy's womb is not something very attractive. However, why is it that our brains are rewired intentially?  I was reduced to conversing with myself the other day, thanks to boredom, my very,very close companion.I started thinking about what I could remember from my days as a very little child. Somehow, I could only make out three, vaguely that is. I simply concluded these golden three were my earliest because I couldn't precisely make out my age from them and because they were as brief as a bolt of lightning. I have chosen to speak of only one though.  I woke up on a misty morning still shy of the sun. The windows were still dark in my grandmother's house and I was blinking repeatedly to get the blotchy feeling out of my eyes. I rubbed my them rather vigorously and heard the birds early morning chatter on the world news. My grandmother's powder room had the lights on, a clear indication that she was up and about. I reluctantly flipped my blanket and was welcomed by the cold breeze of the fan. Standing up, I dizzily walked to the kitchen knowing without a thought that she would be there.  I saw her, standing near the sink. She was peeling something or another and I went closer with the intention to help. Odd = somehow as a child we accept our roles outlined by the respective gender more readily than when we are adults. She handed me the white miniature pumpkin with a severe case of dry skin but refused to give me the small knife. She then briefly disappeared.   I heard the screeching of a chair being lifted up far off and then put down again very close to me. With one mighthy movement, I was carried and I soon found myself on a raised platform. Previously, without the chair, I could only reach the sink if I was standing on my toes.  Within a few minutes, I was dismissed. My little fingers couldn't compensate for the speed she wanted to work with..  That's all...unfortunately. I wish I could remember more on the time when I was a little child under the watchful eye of my grandmother. Those days when life was so simple should have lasted longer and cherished.   Having accounted mine, what's yours?
