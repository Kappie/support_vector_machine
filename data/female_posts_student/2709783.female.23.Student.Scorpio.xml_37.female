In the interests of shaming myself into behaving more appropriately,  urlLink here is the link to Sabrina's entry  about exactly what happened.  Keep in mind that if I'm ever under oath, I will deny these events like nobody's business.    I am thinking about sending flowers to the night shift at Taco Bell.
