There startin to come back cause this stuff all died off after a few years, i dunno why, but there's not enough to fish. there is alot of snakes though. and mom wouldn't appreaciate me harassing all the poor little squirrls. don't have the money for a paintball gun either, well i'll ttyl and ttfn, Cheers!
