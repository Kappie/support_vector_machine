I know what you all must be thinking, but come on, Jesse was the tax man of the household… and now that he isn’t home, I have to do all of the things he did for our household. Well any way… all id good otherwise. I still miss Jesse like mad, but then again who wouldn’t miss him, he is a wonderful guy to be around. I guess I miss having intellectual conversations with people, sometimes. I am not saying that everyone I talk to is not smart, most of them are very intelligent, however no one speaks to me like Jesse does, no one understands where I am coming from. I just hate missing my best friend.
