After that, I went over to Bryan's for a while. That was a lot more fun than my driving lesson. And now...I get to go downtown Chiacgo (Is there any other downtown?) and go out to dinner with my brother and mommy. YaY! I hope it's fun. We're going to some Italian place. Yum. I LOVE italian food. It makes me happy. Plus, I haven't eaten all day. So, even better...  Maybe 'I'll write more later. Maybe not though. I'm not sure I'm going to go online tonight. I don't think I will just so I can get a sort of decent night of sleep. It feels so weird to have to go back to school tomorrow. Tomorrow's definitely not going to feel like a Wednesday.  Hmmm, I still have to read Gatsby...
