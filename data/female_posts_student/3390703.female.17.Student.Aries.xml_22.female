I think Ash is mad at me cause I'm in here, cause I always come in here, but he's just cool!  I still LOVE her the most!  Forever and always!  She is my best friend in the whole wide world, ULTIMATE best friends!  We went to Taco Bell with Karolina, Ashleigh and Amanda!  It was great fun!  Yummie Burrito Supreme!  And then we sat in there forever because it was pouring rain!  Then we stuck into a movie (13 Going On 30) and it was really good!  It made me horny and I wanted love!  Then we started to walk home and it started to pour rain and it was really cold and wet and I was soaked to my underpants!  And there was lightening and it scared me and I screamed!   OOHH, Christian called me from the Dashboard concert and I got to hear part of a song and it made me happy because I l LOVE them so much and I need to go see them next time they are out here!  Ok, goodbye!
