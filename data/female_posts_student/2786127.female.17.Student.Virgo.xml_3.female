It started off okay, church, and then a little macaroni grill for lunch (no complaints there) and then....it just went absolutly nowhere! I sat on my ass, spent two hours making a cd for nate, and ate. What an exciting day for jessica. Nate needs to call me right now so i can go away from this house.  I went to the sweethearts dance last night. Way fun...my best friends makenzie and lindsay were there and they actually danced with me. yay! They said they wouldnt dance so i was sad but then they did so it was a better night then i expected. And yes...for those of you who have read Jon's blog I did in fact have some "black light" issues if you will. If i don't know what im talking about then well....for the better my friends.   So im still really bored. I thought maybe this would unbored me for awhile, but this all took me about two minutes to write, so thats two minutes of something to do, meaning...GOD IM SO BORED.  I'm getting my hair dyed tommorow. yay. i also have to visit good old doctor bob, my dentist, tommorow as well. not cool. I hate the dentist.
