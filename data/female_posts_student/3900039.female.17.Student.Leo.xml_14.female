To think this time in only a year(which isnt as long as it seems, considering how fast all of high school went) my friends and I will be saying goodbye and living on our own. I might have to actually learn how to fold my own burritos... The other day I lost my license and had to go to the DMV, my most unfavorite place, and get a new one. My parents also mentioned my registration was up. They wrote me a blank check and told me to go, and I started bawling and wanted them to come with me, which is something I never do. I am used to doing things on my own, and generally prefer it. I acted like a baby and refused to go without them holding my hand. I don't want to grow up yet... I love just getting to sleep in when I want and call my friends and go float or randomly go camping. I lovebeing able to spend someone else's money and the biggest consequence be having to return whatever I bought. I love only having to make easy decisions like what I want to wear today orwhether I'm going to do my homework or not, not decisions like what bills to pay with this paycheck or which groceries are necessary or how I'm going to pay for college or who I'm going to marry or where I'm going to live. Right now, it feels like my friends are all I have, and I know in a year, I might have to start all over in that department. And it frightens me... As badly as I want to be on my own and have a house and a family and a career, I am scared of the process of getting there. I have an issue with happiness I think... I've gotten to the point where I don't really believe in it, just the idea that I can create my own little happiness world where I can pretend everything works. But now I'm afraid that if I really were happy or I got happiness out of anything, I wouldn't be able to recongize it...and I'd push it away like I've done so many times before.
