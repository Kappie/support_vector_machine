Fantasy act one has just begun but i've seen the end he's going to get your heart which you won't defend those wedding bells are locked inside your head but can't you see you're flirting with the dead you're falling asleep oh girl he can't be in your dreams wake up and believe oh girl don't trust your fantasy that stage was built to break for that fling will fail fear not you have not lost love's left a trail
