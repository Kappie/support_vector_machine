So once you have it, don't let it go because it may never come back to you again...     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     hee~ regarding this quote, I think it really makes sense to a large extent. Yes~ love cannot be measured right? How can you ever weigh it... in fact only your heart knows how important that particular 'someone' is to you. Sometimes, it's a little mysterious... the more you know that 'someone' has taken up a large space in your heart, the more we are so afraid of facing the truth. Therefore we end up trying to run away from it...      Hence, we may lose the one we greatly love and by that time it's probably too late to let that person know how much he means to you... the fact is, we can never turn back time. It's an irreversible hypothesis... thus we should hold on to what we have... and to shower it with love and care whole-heartedly...
