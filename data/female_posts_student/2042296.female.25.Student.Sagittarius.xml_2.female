I don't have too much old school with me here (I miss my Iron Maiden and Judas Priest CDs!!), so I have to listen to Rico's Metallica. Actually I decided to do a hard core experiment and listen a whole CD of Linkin Park (so far I've managed to listen to a whole song from them), but I failed. I could listen to one song and then I had to quit. I just can't stand that numetal (no metal) bullshit "so now I'm gonna sing a little, something angsty and then da dude there is gonna rap a little and it's so fucking cool and we're gonna get loadsa money by fooling people to think that this is good music". Brr. Numetal is probably one of the worst things that have ever happened to the humankind. Silly looking angry young men in very large pants bouncing around the stage trying to be credible... YAAAAAAWN. Yep, I can't help it. I just love old school, black, death, progressive... At least in those genres people (in general) can play their instruments and the vocalists can sing or roar or whatever ;) Found some interesting links considering heavy metal and its history:  http://www.hardradio.com/framehistory.html  http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll  Under allmusic.com there are own categories for all genres of heavy metal, worth reading through. And a couple of radio stations playing hard rock/heavy:  http://64.202.98.75:8100/  http://www.hardradio.com/  Cool.  So, it's time to go again. Take care!
