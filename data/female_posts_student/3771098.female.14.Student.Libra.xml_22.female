It was a 70 mile ride there, so we just talked the whole way there. Once we were done, we ate lunch at the blitz site. It was indian tacos, which are delicious, and we didn't know until after we ate them that they were actually buffalo meat. Then we got to see 2 dogs going at it. It was so funny. When they go at it, the guy swells to they have to uh, wait until he "unswells" himself to get unhooked. It was hilarious to watch. The girl dog just dragged him around for like 2o minutes. Then a little kid tried to kick them apart, and we all got mad at him, because that's just cruel. We watched this for like 45 minutes. Then we drove to the trading post. Well that's like an hour and a half ride, and I had to pee so bad I didn't know what to do. After we left the trading post we went to Oglala college. Rather we rode by it.    On the way back to Shelem, we sang Colors of the Wind (me, Joel, and Allie). We also did the hand motions which are by the way, off the chain. Then everyone else joined in with a bunch of other disney songs. It was great. Then later that night after dinner, a huge storm started up. So Celeste, Me, Jenny, Joel, and 2 other adults went up to the top of the hill to look. It was a huge thunderstorm with no rain. It was crazy. We all got cacti in our shoes, but it was so worth it. I've never seen anything like it before. Then we went back to Kiksuya and sang songs, and went to bed.    Liz
