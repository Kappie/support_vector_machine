But I suddenly had the urge to write one like 5 minutes ago...so I started this one about this evil guy...it sucks...but he is evil...so thats awesome!! There aren't enough evil protagonists in the world (and yes i realize thats a little oxy-moronal, but I don't care cause to me oxy-morons make the most sense...paradoxes are awesome and you know it!!!)  So yeah, Kalam (my character. name derives from the word calamity) he is evil...he kills people and loves it...its potentially great...but I want ice cream and sleep so I'm going to go now...  Chera
