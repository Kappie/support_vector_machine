Saw a bunch of pple, visited classes, hung out w/ mrs. talley, etc.  Then went to mellow mushroom for lunch, then back to school, then my volleyball practice. Hopefully cuts were made today..but they might be made tmrw (not sure yet) then we went back to Chris', she packed, then school supply shopping @ office depot. Back to my house!! FUN TIMES RIGHT THERE! Showering, bed, etc. then this morning then...  FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!  Woah, snuck up from NOWHERE! It was interesting..dont feel like going into the details.  Ya know..its school.  Seeing everyone was great and working sucked.  JUST what i expected! Then this afternoon i had a physical..now im home and guess who else is? TONY and ruthie!
