And for all to see, it is Junaluska.  Just looked on my sheety thing that tells what to bring, etc.  Abby, we don't need towels or sheets, cause they're being provided, but we do need to take a snack.  I called Julie, and that's what she said.  Deech typed out the thing out himself, and as everyone knows how proficient he is at that, he left out many details.  Not as many as I would have figured on though.  Maybe next time... heheh.
