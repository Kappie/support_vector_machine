Sorry for the mass email, I'm going to make an end of semester resolution to stop sending these and actually keep in touch with you all individually, but we all know that, like any other resolution, this one isn't real likely to stick.   So I didn't get a chance to send a real good update in December because my grandfather passed away and things have been sheer chaos since then, so you'll have to settle for the late, quick version for now and if you email me back I'll fill you in on the details.   Well, the big news is that it is official!  Danielle is finally leaving Gainesville!!! Bruce and I are planning a move in August to the greater Orlando area.  He's going to work and try to get them to pay him to play on the computer all day long and I'm going back to school at UCF for another Master's Degree to start with and who knows what after that.  As of right now, my official move date is going to be August 9th, the day after the last day of UF's summer semester, but that may change depending on if they won't let me stay in my apartment the extra week, etc.    The most important thing that this means for those of you that are in Gainesville is that I want to try to see each and every one of you at some point or another before I leave (you wouldn't be getting this email if I didn't care about ya.)  I'd like to think that Bruce and I will have a 4th of July BBQ and/or pool party again but it depends on who all is going to be around.  (Let me know if this will definitely not work for you and we'll work something else out.)  What this means for those of you in Orlando is yippee!!  I'll  be around more than 2 weeks a year.  Woohoo!  What this means for those of you not in Orlando or Gainesville...well, if you're in Orlando, you'll have a place to stay (other than your parents' houses or Disney World.)  Other than that, it's just a chance for updated contact info for your palm pilots :)  So, as of August, here is my new contact information:  Danielle Malo  3146 Windchime Circle South  Apopka, Florida 32703  (407) 592-7847  3 important pieces of information: (1) NO!  I am not moving to Apopka, I'll be living in Seminole County that's just my mailing address.  (2) Yes, I'm going to have an actual house rather than an apartment.  With a fenced in yard...with a picket fence...and an orange tree.  It's all quite exciting. (3) As of right now, I don't intend on having a land line at my house.  I'll have my cell phone and do my best to keep it charged all the time.  I'll use my parents' number in other cases since they'll only be about a mile away.  Finally to clear up any rumors that will be/already are circulating around ASO, no, Bruce and I are planning a wedding and no we don't intend to live together when we move.  We are, however, very excited to be moving to Orlando together, and our first goal is to get Annual Passes to Disney world.  (Ryan and Avi shudder).  Well, that's the big news for now.  The rest is the same ol', same ol': Work is crazy, I am numb with stress, and Zoe still runs away if I let her out without the leash.  Some things never change.  But please keep in touch.  And email me back your contact information, I had a hard time sending out Holiday cards this year, I was missing a lot of addresses.  For those of you I haven't seen or heard from, I miss you and I hope to see you before I leave.  For those of you I only see in rare moments online, I hope that we can do a better job of staying in touch in the future.  To my interns: What are you doing reading emails from your boss during spring break?! shame on you!  Go to the beach!  Enjoy your time off.  Read this later!  Take care.  Lots of love!
