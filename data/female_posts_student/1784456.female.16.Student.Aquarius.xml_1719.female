Nah I'm a complete angle! *Hehe fools!* Ah guess I better stop eating all those aphrodisiacs... and start a new paragraph... Anyway I was doing good yesterday! I was at the co-op promoting fair trade products, surrounded by fair trade chocolate samples... But I held out! (for about two hours) Then I gave in and ate a load. :D I guess about two weeks of lent is enough really. Seeing as heaven doesn't exisit and all, it was more like a test of will and an experimental try and be healthy for a bit.  Guess it failed. Ah well, back to chocolate... Mmm... Green  Blacks Organic orange chocolate is definatly to die for!
