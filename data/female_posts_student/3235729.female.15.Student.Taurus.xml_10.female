I'm kinda pissed off right now because my brother is fucking around with my drumset and he fucking SUCKS at drumming. The funny part is, he's actually  taking  lessons. Yeah, it gets better. Like everything he does, if it takes work and effort, he doesn't do it. So I guarantee he will quit in 2 weeks tops. XD Yeah, I had a big conversation about that in the car on the ride home from my drum lesson, but I can't remember it. That's another thing. I find that it's really hard to remember simple things, such as what I had for lunch. That, or I black out. Lots. Like last Thursday, in social, I blacked out. I looked at the clock and it was 11:00. I look 5 minutes later, it was 11:17. It was kinda creepy. So, then I zone out and Mr. Adams is like, "JODI! you wanna join the class and maybe open your books now?" (Apparently I had blacked out on my binder) I look at him, and open my binder. "Yeah, this is what we call a rhetorical question." And he stretched out 'rhetorical question' as if he was talking to a 5 year old. I just look at him, then I go, "Well, if it was a rhetorical question, then why did you ask me it?" "Go sit outside! Get out of my classroom!" But yeah anyways my brother's being stupid so I'm going to go practice drums so he doesn't drive me nuts with his lack of talent.   -Joebie
