I mean it's not like I'm always talking about him (except in my blog, which I have every right to, because you don't  have  to read this and if you don't like it you can just bugger off), or stalking him like T does, or anything like that. I just think he is very cute and sweet and funny and an all-round awesome guy. How is that obsessing??? *puts down her telescope to look at everyone indignantly*   Hey, you know what's crazy? He pretty much fits every single thing I said in response to that perfect guy forward ^^; Look, ma! It's fate!   So anyway. I totally kicked ass in my science presentation, and I am very proud. Or at least, according to B I did ^^; I'll take their word for it, because I trust them and I like thinking that I kicked ass in my science presentation. Of course, the other thing that kinda pushes me toward that is that everyone cheered after. Which is always nice, because I like applause.   What is also cool is that tomorrow is a Day 3. I like Day 3s. I like Day 1s even more, but Day 3s aren't too bad. I have english first, which is cool, because that means Frodo's there and he's always fun. Plus, Murdles says she feels better so maybe she'll actually  show up  tomorrow, and Britnix will be there and so will all my other good buddies. Of course, we'll be working on those damn essays, so that won't be too great. But I'll live. Also! On odd days we have music! Yayy! I love music. I don't think I'll take it next year (A isn't taking it, and it's really hard, and I wanna stick to my social sciences so I'll probably be changing from economics to american history), so I'm trying to fit as much musicality into this last month as I can. Aiee! Exams in one month! Aw, crud.. *g* lol.   Hm. Does anyone really know what they want to do with their life?  So many people are like, "I wanna be a lawyer!" or, "I wanna be a doctor!" or whatever. I've got no idea. And not only that, I don't want to have an idea. I'm worried about university. If I go to university right after highschool... what more do I have time for? I mean, I guess I could do all my travelling after university, but.. where is the adventure? I still want to go walk across some country, or at least experience crazy things so that I've got stories for my grandkids. If I have any. Okay, rewrite: ... so that I've got stories for other people's grandkids. Sure, it's nice having an idea of where you're going, but if you just 'follow a plan,' where is the excitement? There is none. I'm just worried that somehow I'll get stuck in a box. I don't want a normal job. I want something that is challenging and lets me do my own thing. I almost (not quite, but almost) wish my life wasn't so great; sure, it'd be hell, but where are the stories? What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. And they give ya something to write in your memoirs.   If I could be anything... I don't know. I'd love to help out in Canada -- politics could work. Except I hate being hated; I'd either have to be really good, or not do it at all. I couldn't stand to do something that people hate me for. Philosophy seems to fit me really well too, what with me going off on tangents all the time about life, but what kind of career is that? Exactly. It's  not  a career. Philosophers died out with the Greeks and the Romans. You either teach it, or read it. Nobody does any actual thinking these days; our ancestors have done pretty much all of it. Or at least, I think so. If anyone knows of an actual, plausible career made out of philosophy (other than professor / teacher / etc.), please, let me know.   Another option would be writing. But as I doubt I'll ever finish a novel, journalism would be the only way to go... and I hate writing that way. I mean, I can usually do a pretty good job, but I loathe writing like that. It is painful for me to write like that. Bare facts are nice, but not my style. I like sticking in my personality and my voice. And if you do that in journalism, that's cheating; that is not giving the public what's  really  going on, that's giving the public what you  think  is going on. Not the same thing. Hopefully the doc and SC aren't reading this ^^; It wouldn't do for the newspaper staff to get wind of this... of course, I've already gotten the job, so what can they do? Oh ya! Me, AR and FR (whoever that is) got Co-Editor. And only 4 people applied. How great is that?? Of course, I'll be the only one in gr. 11, and with any luck FR will ditch us like she did last time, but ya know. Pretty crazy. And gratz to A for getting the managerial (is that even a word?) position at the Country Corner Store.   But back to my original topic. Or what's left of it. I don't want to live a normal life. I want stories and adventures that I can talk about when I'm older and there's nothing more to do. I'd like to be able to say that I went against the flow, and did something beautiful. Didn't bow down to the system, didn't lose the young ideals, didn't give in, didn't back off. Preferably, I'd like to be able to say that I never grew up, and that I'll be 15 forever, but I'm getting the feeling that's not going to happen. Ladies and gentlemen, it's official, Santa Claus doesn't exist, and Peter Pan isn't going to pick up Caleigh on his way to Never Never Land...
