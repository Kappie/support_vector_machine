Today was an abundant day, full of fun and very little homework. It's really nice to be able to take time to go to starbucks with your friends and relax for an hour. The Flame got sorted and SLA stuff figured out. As previously mentioned we went to starbucks (we being Trevor, Hannah, Erica and I; Diana and Sam couldn't be bothered and Chris is STILL grounded). i came home and played High-Ho-CherryO with Torey and then avoided calc for a while. For the first time in a while my world didn't feel like it was lacking something, which was good, very good.
