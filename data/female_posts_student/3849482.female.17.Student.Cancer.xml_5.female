Yes, one of them is because  Mercs  is evil and doesn't ever look at my sites anyway, you huge, huge, huge meanie!!!!  :P  Also, I'm not really sure how to customize this site and customization is vital in having an online journal, for me, anyway.  My new site is :  urlLink http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=starry_eyed_firefly   But maybe I will continue to post here at times since xanga is in no way private, and barely anyone knows about  this  journal, hehe.  Bye for now!
