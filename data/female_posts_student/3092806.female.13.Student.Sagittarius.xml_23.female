See, I've been trying to lose weight for a little while, four to five weeks to be precise, and I'm afraid my mom will tell the doctor that I'm not eating. I AM eating, just not as much as I used to. I cut some things out of my diet, like chocolate and soda. Basically my changing has only improved my health status. I've lost probably about ten to fifteen pounds by restricting my day's calories to under 1700. My mom is freaked out by this. She says I'm getting too skinny. Ha, I wish I was skinny... Yesterday, I broke my rules and had a Reese's and a Coke. See, I'm not totally restricting myself... I still indulge every once and awhile. If she tells my doctor that I'm not eating then they'll make me eat a lot for months and I'll gain back all the weight I lost. I think that I can deal with the weight gain but I actually like my meal plan. I don't want to have to change it. I've gotten so accustomed to it.    Anyways, let's forget all about weight loss and eating... Let's get moving onto my physical appearance. Rather regretfully I'm not all that pretty. The only physical attributes that I have ever beenpaid a nice compliment onare my hair, my smile,and my eyes. My sixth grade reading teacher, before I gotglasses,said that my eyes were hypnotizing and that once I got a boyfriend he'd love looking into them. Ha, what a laugh. Anyhow, for my smile my cousin, Donna, said that it was very cute. I have no clue on what she's talking about. I've got partially yellow teeth for goodness sakes! Lastly, the comment that I recieve about my hair is that the color is beautiful. Whatever... Like I believe that. I am no beauty. I'm five foot five, hazel eyed, brown haired with awkward red and blonde highlights, glasses wearing, zit faced, yellow teethed thirteen year old girl. No wonder why I don't have a boyfriend. Not only am I antisocial, but I'm ugly too...    Ugh, I'm gone...
