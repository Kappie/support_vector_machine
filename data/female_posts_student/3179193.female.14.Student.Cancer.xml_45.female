I couldn't read the Chinese online! It was the registration for the song-writing thing. I wasn't sure what was supposed to go where so I had to ask someone who knew Chinese better than I did. Haha! I'm gonna check again with my mom later. Just in case.  Read AL's blog and yeah... phew... itf's wise! I guess things that happen teach you a lesson and some people actually learn and take it all in. Itf's a smart kid... Itf knows what to do.  Oh my gosh! FTV just called me! The radio station thing with the song-writing contest! They called regarding my registration and they asked if I would be able to make it to Vancouver since they're recording the performances on TV there and I'm like: "NOOOO!" 'cos my mom would never let me go! *sighzZ* Oh well... maybe next time.   Disappointment... *sighzZ* I actually thought that this might be able to bring our band somewhere. Oh well. Whatever. Maybe next time? They have a contest every I-don't-know-how-many years and soon we'll be old enough to go to Vancouver so whatever.  *sighzZ* That taught me something. Don't put your hopes up too high. Oh well. Whatever.   Oh yeah, back to the Nima's call thing. He called to see if I wanted to go outside with him and Mark but I doubted my mom would've let me so I said no. Just stayed home and worked with the guitar.  Bruce just came online. Haha... talking to him right now. My mom is having second thoughts about letting me go on Saturday! 'Cos it's supposedly gonna rain. I personally don't mind the rain but my mom's afraid I'll get sick. *sighzZ* It's supposedly gonna rain on both Sunday and Saturday. Oh my gosh! It's like gonna so ruin my hair! Haha! Preppyness! Anyway... *sighzZ* So tired and bored. I wonder what we're having for dinner? Iunno... blah.  Gonna go back to talking to Alice and Brucey... I'm off for now.
