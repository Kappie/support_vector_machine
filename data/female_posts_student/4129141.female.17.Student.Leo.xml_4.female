Instead, it was one of my good ones, just like my junior one from last year- but they should have not used the yellow filter, that made my skin look weird in my school senior photo. I got jobs that I like this time,unlike yesterday. My job coach also gave me a lot of praise, and said I was working independently. I cleaned the outside of fish tanks and cleaned shelves.Maybe work isn't so bad after all.  *Happily Smiles*
