Since they had no place to stay they stayed with me... and given that it was his birthday we threw him a little party. I had a great time, and I hope that everyone else did too. I was kinda surprised at who didnt show up... I had invited a large number of Alpha Gams, none of which showed. Oh well... those that did show up seemed to have fun. Apparently my neighbor wasn't there, to which I say "whew".  I talked to Scott two days ago... we talked about my possible moving down there to find a job. I think I would like it there, despite the heat. I know if he can handle it I can. I just don't know where I'm going, or what I'll be doing. Rather scary if you ask me!
