Jesse has call twice since arriving in Kuwait. He told me that they were going to move him to a camp up north, but still in Kuwait. I worry about him, as I should, but not as much knowing that he is in Kuwait and not in Iraq. I am getting ready to send him the first hand written letter; sort of a test to see how long a letter takes to get to him. I am not even sure id postage is different when sending packages and letters to APO addresses. I think about him every second of my day and anxiously await his next phone call home. Jesse sounded really good when I talked to him. He told me that when he got to the new camp that he would see if they would place him on a night shift so that he can be awake when I am awake and we could talk more. I told him if he could do that it would be great. David got moved to another camp away from Jesse. Jesse said that David was not happy about this but the fact of the matter is that the decision to send him south was decided on partly because they wanted him to be in a safer location (with Abigail (his 4 month old daughter) in mind). I continue to pray for Jesse and David every night and hope that they, and all of the members of the 319th, will remain safe during their stay in the Middle East.  I am doing a little better… I am adjusting to all that has happened to me as well as can be expected, after the last 2 weeks, having to say goodbye to my Husband and dealing with the wrongful death of my Nana (Grandma), and after all of that, getting a viral infection that caused me to have to take another week off from school and work. I knew upon receiving the news of Jesse’s deployment that our lives were going to be changed… but I can safely say that I never saw this coming. I can only hope that the president sends our boys and girls home sooner than expected, or that this year will go by fast.
