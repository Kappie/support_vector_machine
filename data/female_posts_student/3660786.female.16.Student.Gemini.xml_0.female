My "mom" had aranged for me to go sell rootbeer floats at Safeway, to help support prostate cancer. I was fine with that, nothing better to do during summer than sell rootbeer floats in a hot parking lot, to support a masculine cancer.   It was almost 2:30, and I was anxious to get done so i could go to Subway and get something to eat. Suddenly out of the doors stumbled this drunk man. He came over to the table and was muttering about how his wife lived a few blocks away and he was going to tell her we had pop, or something like that. Then he went back into the store, and I watched him go to the meat department, grab a ham, and shove it down his pants! He stumbled back to where I was, and stood there apparantly looking for his vehicle... I was thinking "Oh dear Godm he is going to drive." then my mouth said something totally different. "Sir, Take the pork out of your pants." I was like WTF? Where did that order come from. But he looked at me, smiled, bearing his ulgy yellow teeth, and plopped the ham down on the table then walked across the parking lot to the bus stop. I was too terrified to touch the ham, to my friend Demi had to come ant take it away for me.  That was one of the very few adventures i hope not to remember.  I don't kow why all this stuff happens to me! It seems wherever I go someone is doing something ridiculous. one day, i will live a normal life, just to see what it feels like!
