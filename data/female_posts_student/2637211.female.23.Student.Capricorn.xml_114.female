Sometimes it actually works better, only I need to make sure I stay focused on a single theme, and then come up with what the point is. I'll need to do some serious editing, though. Hopefully, I'll get done early enough to get Liz to read it. We'll see. It always takes longer than I expect. I'm sure I'll keep you posted.
