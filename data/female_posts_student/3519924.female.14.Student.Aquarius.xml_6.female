It goes for almost everyone in the world, including me:  ***You tell me you hate/everything about me/you tell me I can't be wrong/you say I think I know it all/I think I'm stupid/I'm ugly inside/you're taking me down/when I've lost all my pride  Does it make you feel good/critisizing me/does it annoy you so much/I'm not exactly what you want me to be  Do you think you're perfect/everyone should be just like you/Do you think I should change/wake up and see/you have your faults too/nothing's that easy  Does it make you feel good/critisizing me/does it annoy you so much/I'm not exactly what you want me to be  We're so caught up in our hypocracy/who are we to judge/Can't you just let me be***   So for further news, I blame everything going wrong on this thing in my head. It has brought WAY too much negativety to my world. I've got problems with basically all of my friends sept. Andie.  And "I think I'm drifting away from the people I really need"-Trapt  Cori: *Pissed, she barely knows/cares that I exist anymore cuz she's little miss "happy go lucky, oh look at me 'I lie to myself'" and I'm not..so she found a new best friend who is just like her. Mandy: *Pissed, Mandy is a little poser now, who calls herself punk and claims she listens to all of this music that's she's never even heard...and she dresses like a prep, is a little goody-goody, but claims that she dresses like Avril Lavigne....lol. Rachael: *Annoyed, as we all know, Ray is lil wannabe-me... Brittany: *Weird, We do not bond anymore because I'm always depressed and she doesn't know how to deal with it..she's too perverted so we don't talk much lol. Ashley: *Annoyed, I love Ashley and the only prob. with her is she can be annoying Andie: *Sad, I miss her too much... Sam P:, *Hatred, hates me bc. she's cori's "little miss positive" and I think she needs to be slapped... Sam W., *Major Hate, Always talking shit behind my back, but yet, has no problem using me to make new friends Kay: *Uknown, actually, I don't really have a problem with Kay, sept. half of the reason that she hangs with me is so she can burn my cd's and do stupid shit with me...no prob here lol. Cheeto: *Guilt, I feel totally guilty about all the shit that I said to her, and I feel like shit...I just don't know anymore  News cont... I talked my parents into letting me keep the stray cat in the garage, he's pure white and beautiful..he has to stay in the garage most of the time but we feed him and take care of him. I felt like he was just looking for love, so I shall love him and we shall find other love together.  Phrase of the day: "Though shall not judge until the is perfect.."-Oh yeah, that was totally me Song Of The Day: Outside-Staind Event of the day: Eating like 1/4 of the gallon of Mint Chocolate Chip in the freezer with a spoon (although there is no spoon)...and seeing the bear in the tree outside of my window
