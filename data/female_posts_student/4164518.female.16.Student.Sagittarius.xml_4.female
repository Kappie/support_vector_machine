I feel like I've been away for ages, I haven't but still.  I've got nothing to write about, but I'll still fill space with utter garbage. I want to go into town, but train fare will cost me £5, and that's pretty much all the money I have gone.  And then I'll need cigarettes.  My dad still owes me £20, but I doubt I'll ever get it.  I have no idea how I'm going to afford this week in London, especially with Josh's party, all my money will go on drink.  There's the gig at the Grapes tonight, it's some guy called Paul and a couple of others doing an acoustic set.  I don't think I'm going. Hardly anyone's online, wish they would be, I'm so bored.  Can't think of anything else to write, think I'll go make a cup of tea.
