WISH YOU WERE -OR- ANTI-VALENTINE  post opinions...  "Positive Thinking"  --Intro thingy:-- Something inside/Is holding you back. You just can't shine,/But I care. I'll be there all the way.  --Chorus-- Try to have strength./Try to have faith. Try to carry on./It'll be okay in the end. Don't be afraid./Don't hide your face. Don't want you to cry anymore. Just hold your breath./Take it in. Someday you'll win./Never fade away.  --We'll just call this a verse-- Just say a prayer./Call His name. It's there for the taking./Be welcoming. It's hard, I know/To have positive thinking. But it's okay./We can dare to dream. We will succeed./Never worry. Thank my Lord.  --Chorus x2--  Try to have strength./Try to have faith. Try to carry on./It'll be okay in the end.
