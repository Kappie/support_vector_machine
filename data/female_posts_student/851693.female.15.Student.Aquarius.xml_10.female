Rehearsals are not really fun ALL the time, they can be quite difficult you know, especially for the directors cos we have to oversee everything and be vigilant always. Actually how do you feel towards acting? I personally think acting is fun cos you can impersonate someone else and walk in the shoes of another person for a little while.. And lose yourself in that character momentraily.. Ain't that good?  Its perfectly fine if you don't enjoy urself to the fullest during rehearsals. Luling is not a cheerful charcter after all.. If you're feeling blue in the midst of acting means part of you has already become luling. That's not a bad thing exactly. Its never easy to get yourself absorbed totally in a charcter. Maybe you'd be wondering. Who am I exactly? But its important to concentrate completely if not your attention will be diverted easily and you can't do your job properly. You need a paradigm shift. Rehearsals are hard work, but once you're 'lost' in them, you'll enjoy them already.  In my previous production I even found rehearsals painful because it felt torturous sometimes to get on with those rehearsals. But on the day itself, everything will seem different and feel different. Once you went past that "hu3 du4 men2" you're luling untill the curtains draw to a close. When the production is over you'll feel glad, probably, but sad as well because you'll find that a feeling of emptiness swallows you. What you will be left with are only memories. Tears, frustrations, scoldings, compliments, hard feelings--- all gone.  -not tezuka.
