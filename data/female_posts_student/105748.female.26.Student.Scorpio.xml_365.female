CHAT -- as far as the username and password; if you have not been there yet you will need to register a name for the chat.  Click on the "register here" link.  After you sign up, you should be good to go.  You'll use the same username and password to login to the chat every time.  I'm hoping that we can all chat as a group one day -- see if the thing really works.    SHE: You use the username and password that I emailed to you for the FTP.  If you deleted it, I can email it to you again.  Now you can upload your pictures through the web!  Cool, huh?    APRIL:  I have not set you up with webspace yet; but if you want to have your own space to FTP to just let me know and I will set it up.
