Well I went to work and it was crazy- it was soo busy, I don't think that anyone really got a break.  :-/ if I wasn't at school I would have came to help them out.  BUT I WAS AT SCHOOL.  Speaking of school there are only 7 more days that i have to wait up.    7   woo haha thank the LORD.  Dr. Bachi worked today- whatta fun guy lol he's soo cute.  Hm.. I think that's all, I'm gunna post some quotes just cuz i'm bored.  "Say you'll share with me, one love, one lifetime, warm my heart with talk of summertime. Say you'll need me both for now and always, anywhere you go let me go too, love me, that's all I ask of you."  "So this is what I'm going to do: I'm going to hug you. And I'm not going to let go for a really long time. And I'm going to tell you that I love you. Which is actually a pretty good deal. Because it means I'll do anything on the off chance it'll make you a little less sad" --Dawson's Creek  Life is like a pillow...it starts out fluffy and then gradually gets all beat up its not comfortable anymore...it can be refluffed to a point...but there are times when u just need a new pillow....and someone special to share it with :)  I still believe one day you I will find ourselves in love again   *A true friend is a person who is there for you through thick  and thin. They don't judge you by the clothes you wear, or the  size of your house. They love you no matter what. They are a  shoulder to cry on, or a partner to laugh with. They stand by  you in your times of need, and listen when you are excited.  They know every little thing about you. They stand up for you  when others don't.*  *Well it was a million tiny, little things that when you added them all up, they meant we were supposed to be together . . . and I knew it. I knew it the very first time I touched her. It was like coming home . . . the only real home I'd ever known. I was just taking her hand to help her out of a car. It was like . . . magic.* ~ Sleepless In Seattle   That's all 4 now.. i'll probably post more later! :) Bye
