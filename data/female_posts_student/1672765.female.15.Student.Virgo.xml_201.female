I have a "consultation" with my oral surgeon today at 11:15 in Lynchburg, so I have to leave around 10. I am so sick of  consultations . That's all I do, nothing ever gets done, they just talk to me about what will get done to my teeth. I was at the orthadontist Wednesday and he said that anytime after two weeks go in to Dr. Todd and get all that stuff we've talked about so many times done. That puts my surgery right around the time I go to the Warped Tour. I don't really want to be in all that pain and everything while I'm rocking out to Tiger Army (ha ha), so this time  I  might be the one pushing things back. Oh, the irony.   I watched Jeopardy last night, because I wanted to see that guy who's been winning so much. It made me so sad. I feel so bad for the other people, who get left behind in the dust because that one guy is so smart. How can anybody be so smart?? He has to be cheating...somehow.... I mean, how can anybody remember that much?? I remember things for tests, then I forget everything. But I guess that's just me.... I was rooting on the other guys, namely Lou because he has such a happenin' name. Lou Lou Lou. So cool. This one guy, Tom I think, got a Daily Double and he like doubled his score and was  ahead  of whats-his-name and I was so excited but then Ken (that's his name) went ahead of him. He irks me...  I refuse to be bought by this easy HTMLing.
