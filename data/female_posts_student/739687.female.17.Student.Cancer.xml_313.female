Sunday= hangover, rest day.  Monday I got my license! Whoo hoo, it's about time. Still, however, my car's in the shop. So I'm forced to drive the mexi-truck. Oh, also Monday, I got hired at Whataburger. I'll be working in Roanoke until the new one in Keller opens, which should be soon!  Tuesday....didn't anything really of importance.  Wednesday I went down to Dallas with my dad to find the asshole that sold us my car illegally, because he didn't finish all the papers. So we got that taken care of, got my car registered, now it just needs to pass inspection, which it didn't do Tuesday.  Yesterday I started working...which was cool. I work today and Saturday again from 4-8.  I'm going shopping in a little bit, so I'll be heading off to go do that.  So there you have it, my week, short and sweet without the long, drawn out details. I figured I'd spare you all.  Oh! How could I forget...my schedule. (Seeing as how school starts Monday!)  This Semester:  1st Period - AP Statistics - Garrett 2nd Period - Pre-cal Pre-AP - Benbow 3rd Period - BCIS - Folger 4th Period - French 3 - Curry  Next Semester- 1st Period - English 3 Weighted - Shannon 2nd Period - Physics Pre-AP - Hanifan 3rd Period - French 4 - Curry 4th Period - US History AP - Murtagh  Well, that about covers it!  Have a nice rest-of-summer crazies! (Err...try to.)
