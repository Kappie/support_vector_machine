I meant to leave at 10am, not leave the city on a bus westbound at 10am, but sure enough, I got into that bus forgetting that I was supposed to meet my ride at 12pm, not 11am.  Somewhere around 35 minutes into the ride my mouth dropped open and I gasped, "Oh no!"  My mistake suddenly hit me.  I'd have to let my ride know not to bother to pick me up, or I'd have to wait at the bus station for an extra hour.  What a twit.  Feeling very uninspired today.  Maybe a little diss. work and leave the Psych until tomorrow.  More to come...
