I was especially impressed with all the cool cinematography stuff, that definitly is cool. My one real 'beef' with the movie was the whole Sirius Black thing. I dunno Gary Oldman is cool, (Sid Vicious!) but he didnt portray the Sirius i was thinking about when i read the book. Like in the book dont they describe Sirius as being this handsome guy whos all scruffy cuz of the whole Azcaban thing? I dunno, i also thought he would be younger... but w/e. it was still good. The guy who played Lupin was cool to. I wasnt a big fan of his little moustache thing, it looked like he had a cut they sewed together and left a scar so the hair wouldnt grow! *sigh* But as usual the HP cast got a lot hotter and more pleasing to the eye. Emma Watson (Hermione) is gonna be one hot momma when shes older! Same with Dan (harry) hes lookin pretty fine himself and Ron looked like hes been workign out! hes buffed up a bit which i thought was cool. Over all it was a good show and i recomend it to any Harry Potter fan. P.S. Props to the new director, hes got a new style that i liked in the HP series! P.S.S Y Tu Mama Tambien was an awesome movie (I reccomend that one too)
