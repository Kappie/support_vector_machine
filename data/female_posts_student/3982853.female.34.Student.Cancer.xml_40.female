Her mother, Madame de Moerder, was the wife of a Russian general. She had abandoned her husband and settled in Switzerland with his three children. She was accompanied by Alexander Trophimowsky, the children's tutor. Trophimowsky was an intellectual and former Armenian Orthodox priest turned atheist and Nihilist, who had abandoned his own wife and children for Madame de Moerder. He was the father of Eberhardt, who took her mother's maiden name, and quite probably Augustin, the older brother for whom she held a morbidly romantic affection.   Trophimowsky encouraged non-conformism, and gave Isabelle an eclectic education, which included six languages, metaphysics and chemistry. He did not stand in the way of her occasional adventures dressed as a boy, or the growing interest in Islam she shared with her mother. By the 1890s, the de Moerder household had acquired a number of Moslem friends, and Isabelle was corresponding with a French officer stationed in the Sahara. Augustin had been in the Foreign Legion and remained in North Africa. In 1897, the household moved to Bone in Algeria, where Isabelle and her mother converted to Islam, and lived in the Arab section of town.   Not long after settling, Madame de Moerder died, which affected Isabelle greatly. Before a lack of money forced her temporary return to Europe, she bought a horse and galloped off towards the desert dressed as an Arab man, wandering for as long as she could. This was to set the tone for the rest of her life.  Trophimowsky died in Switzerland, and Augustin was estranged by his marriage. Restless and troubled, Eberhardt craved a spiritual absolute, which she came closest to in the desert. On her return to Algeria in 1900, she flung herself into a nomadic, Arabic way of life. She could speak and write the language fluently, and found herself at home in the Sahara, coming to know it almost as well as a native.       advertisement          advertisement   In the desert, the contradictions of Isabelle's life came to the fore. She adopted the persona of an Arab man, calling herself Si Mahmoud, wandering incessantly and earning a meagre income as a journalist. She was despised by the European community, but became a valued adviser to the French administration. It was known that she was a woman, certainly by the string of Arab lovers she took, but she was accepted by the Arabs as a man. A European acquaintance said of her, "she drank more than a Legionnaire, smoked more kif than a hashish addict, and made love for the love of making love".  Islam forbids alcohol to the faithful, but Isabelle balanced alcoholism with deep religious convictions. She was prone to moments of ecstasy, and would often lose herself in contemplation of the desert. She even managed to be accepted into a religious order, and had what was possibly more than a spiritual friendship with its grand master.  For all her sexual adventurousness, Isabelle was devoted to the Arab soldier she married in 1901. Slimene Ehnni must have been a remarkably forbearing man. He tolerated his wife's random affairs, as well as her bouts of alcoholic misery, her religious retreats and her frenzied dashes into the space and solitude of the desert.   For all the wild freedom of the life she had chosen, Isabelle dreamed of setting up a small business with Slimene. It was not to be. In 1904, she sought hospital treatment for her recurring malaria in a town on the edge of the Sahara. A flash flood brought a strange death - she drowned in the desert, aged 27.
