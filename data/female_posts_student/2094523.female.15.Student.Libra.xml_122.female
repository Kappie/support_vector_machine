Its so weird and it seems like ure wasting your days away. I've always told my self that id make the best of each and everyday and live it to the fullest but after awhile i guess i kinda gave up on that so here I am wasting life away. its sad.   Anyways some people that piss me off arent the ones i have anythign against, arent they ones that are annoying or cocky or arrogant nor the ones i hate and want to die... theyre the ones im jealous of.   Ppl may say im fine the way i am btu they never act like i am. I mean if i was so "perfect" the way i am you wud actually give a fuck bout me and not dedicate your attention to someone whose obviously way better than i am and you realize it. You can tell me so much but i know theyre only words. words that dont mean a thing which is why i rarely believe what anyone says. If you spoke the truth I wudn't be here sulkign bout it wud i now. yah thats right. You tell me im perfect but u dont act liek i do, you act like every other person is but me.
