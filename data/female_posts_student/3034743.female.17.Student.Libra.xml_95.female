In math, Tommy had a chipmunk, so we got to play with that for awhile. It was a baby, and it was so cute! Lunch was fun too. Erin and I got into a cake fight. Holli had made cake because it was Ben's (or as Amanda would say, Jamin's) birthday. Well, me and Erin shared a piece, and we made a mess of it! She threw some at me, so then I got her back, and so on and so forth. It was fun, and messy. Those were really the only highlights of my day. Other than that, it was pretty normal. Tomorrow I have to give a speech in psychology about interpersonal attraction. I finished the paper yesterday, and I have decided to put it in here. Read it if you like, or don't. Doesn't matter to me--it is nothing exceptionally good. Well, I'll blog later.   Interpersonal Attraction  A man and woman have fun together on their first date.  They laughed at the same parts in the movie, agreed quickly on a restaurant because they like the same kind of food, and enjoyed the conversation.  As the evening draws to an end, however, the woman wonders whether to agree to a second date.  She thinks he is a nice guy, a good person, so why doesn’t she feel especially attracted to him?  As a man enters his apartment, he notices his neighbor leaving her place and they exchange smiles.  Once inside, he wonders why he finds her so attractive.  He knows nothing about her, but he always thinks about her and what she is like.  What is it about her that he finds increasingly appealing? In another scenario, a woman finds herself attracted to a coworker based solely on his exceptionally good looks.  He is clearly wrong for her, but she is captivated by his physical appearance.  Could she really be falling for Mr. Wrong just because he’s good looking?    Liking someone but not finding them “romantically” attractive, becoming attracted to the “familiar stranger”, and favoring someone for his or her good looks rather than deeper qualities seem like all too common cases.  This is due to the fact that most of us find many different people attractive in different ways (Weber, 2003).  In social psychology, attraction is described as an attitude of liking (positive attraction) or disliking (negative attraction).  In interpersonal attraction, one can see that there are many factors that attract us to particular people as potential friends or partners.  The four main determining factors of interpersonal attraction include physical appearance, similarity to ourselves, evidence that our attraction is returned, and proximity (Rathus, 1998, 472).  Physical appearance plays an important role in interpersonal attraction.  This is because we generally tend to notice a person’s appearance before anything else.  Since people have different perceptions, there is no single answer for physically attractive “standards.”  However, there are some things that are viewed as attractive to many cultures.  An example would be a smiling person, for they are generally perceived as more attractive than a person who is frowning.  In a study done, British and Japanese people were asked to identify features that they found to be attractive.  The facial features found in “attractive” women include large eyes, high cheekbones, and narrow jaws.  In another study, infants were studied to see what they found to be attractive.  It was determined that the longer the gaze towards a person from the infant, the more attractive that person was.  Infants, as young as 2 months, preferred faces that were also rated by adults as most attractive.  This evidence suggests that we may be born with a predisposition to find certain types of physical features attractive (Rathus, 1998, 472-73).    Facial features are not the only aspect studied dealing with physical attractiveness, but as well as body shape and type.  Preferences for body shape vary greatly, and there is a great deal of variation in people’s standard for attractiveness of body shape.  This includes both the shape we prefer for others, and the shape we perceive ourselves to have.  In a study done amongst college students, men and women were both asked to describe the “ideal” body shape.  Most of the men said that their body shape was near the ideal standard, while most women thought that they were heavier than the ideal shape.  This suggests that females are more likely than males to incorrectly think they are too heavy to be attractive (Rathus, 1998, 473).  There is also evidence that physical appearance has a greater role in the attraction of males to females than vice versa (Gale, 2001).  Other people’s physical appearance influences perceptions of our own attractiveness as well.  When observed simultaneously, people of average attractiveness tend to be judged more attractive when they are with a same-sex person who is very good-looking, but they are thought of as less attractive when with someone who is unattractive.  When observed sequentially, however, the reverse effect occurs.  In heterosexual relationships, although people’s overall impressions of a man appear to be influenced by his partner’s physical attractiveness, the same effect does not hold for a woman (Franzoi, 2003).    Besides physical attractiveness, it is also noticed that there is a tendency to be attracted to others who are similar to us in particular characteristics.  This is known as the matching hypothesis. Friends and partners also tend to be similar to one another in race, ethnicity, age, level of education, and religion (Bersheid, 1988, 92).  In fact, similarity of attitudes is a key contributor to attraction in both friendships and romantic relationships.  People also gravitate to others who are like themselves in terms of characteristics related to affiliation, including sociability, friendliness, and warmth (Gale, 2001).  Being attracted to people similar to ourselves can be traced back to the fact that people desire cognitive consistency or “balance” in their thoughts, feelings, and social relationships (Franzoi, 2003).  It is only natural that we want to be around someone who shares similar views and feelings, but we also like to be around people who like being around us as well.  Another major aspect dealing with interpersonal attraction is called reciprocity.  Reciprocity is the mutual exchange of feelings or attitudes (Rathus, 1998, 474). Interpersonal attraction theorists view reciprocity as an important contributor to the emergence of positive feelings among persons (Hallinan, 1999).  It makes sense for one to want to spend time with someone who enjoys his or her company as well. If given the choice, most people wouldn’t prefer to spend time with those that don’t like them compared to those that do.  Research has even shown that people are more open, warm, and helpful when they are talking with strangers who seem to like them (Rathus, 1998, 474).  If led to believe that another likes or dislikes us, we may behave in ways that confirm that expectation (Franzoi, 2003).  For example, Blau argues that an interaction is rewarding when the partner in the social exchange communicates approval of the person (Hallinan, 1999).  Reciprocity is, therefore, an important stabilizing factor in an interpersonal relation.  Proximity is another category that helps shine light onto the mysteries of interpersonal attraction.  Obviously, in order to meet, two people must share close proximity.  The sharing of this space will help one to get to know a person better. In some cases becoming more familiar with an individual can lead to a dislike of that individual. More often, though, getting to know someone leads to a deeper relationship with that individual (Bersheid, 1988, 85).  The case of proximity could be the cause of the attraction that the man held in the scenario towards his female neighbor.  It is logical that people develop feelings towards those whom they are in close contact with.  Interpersonal attraction can be better understood by studying the factors that compose the subject.  The components including physical appearance, similarity to ourselves, evidence that our attraction is returned, and proximity all help to make sense of the riddle in which attraction is hidden (Rathus, 1998, 472).  Every component, in a sense, is intertwined with the other.  Proximity will determine the number of times we come into contact with a person.  Before knowing anything about the person we come into contact with, we see their physical appearance and judge the attractiveness of it.  If some attraction is there, we may pursue them further and get to know them better.  Soon enough, we will be able to tell how similar the person is to ourselves.  Then if we want to continue any form of relationship with them, we will determine to do so or not based on the way that they perceive us.  If everything goes well, we will have a new friend or companion.  It may seem like a complicated process at first, but when broken down into smaller fragments, interpersonal attraction is not only easily understood, but it is also fascinating as well.  Interpersonal attraction is the reason and science behind everyday relationships, making it an important aspect to comprehend.
