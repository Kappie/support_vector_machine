I lay starving to death, and he called and was equally starving and tired as I was, so he brought some chicken wings and we ate them, then Alex narrowly missed a windshield while hitting a baseball, and all the while I shouted odd noises that echoed off of nearby houses and sang such songs as  Chinese Freestyle ,  Santa's Coming  (cKy version of course, "Is there anything you can do? YOU CAN GET BACK TO WORK!), and  The Skeletor Song . There's also a really cool dood down the street named Cody, he has an electric scooter and he was riding around helping us get the ball back when we hit it, and he brought up that he can play guitar, so Alex and I naturally looked at each other and watched each other's lightbulbs come on, and we ran over yelling "SCOOTER KID COME OVER!" He said he had to go, so I invited him to the session tomorrow where we will test him out. If he isn't much good, he can just do all the rhythm and I'll take the leads. I'm just happy to have a dood now, I dun really care how good he can play as long as he can play. He looks like a punx0r kid tho...so time's gonna tell on this one.  And also...Kenzie's not out of school tomorrow, so we're short one demi-bass player until this weekend, whereupon she has consented to learn the bass parts from me. Lily might also be coming to watch, so she can report back about the wonderful joys of a session. WHEE! Sessions are only good if we're hyper. Other than that, we just like hearing ourselves play the songs and making them feel good...hence the audience is bored. However, you should have seen the practice sessions for  Freedom , and look at the end result there. The sessions were boring even for me...that has a lot to do with the fact that I only did one song, tho, and I had to watch Joe tell bad jokes and try to sing rawk songs, the poor guy. But hey, I'm pretty sure that we were well-liked by all.  So w00t. I went to the mall today, for the second time this week...and consequently, for the second time this week, I've met Ryan Jones both times while walking out of Hot Topic. Today he was talking about being stoned and screwing...I had no idea what he was talking about. But he did talk a lot and I just sort of sat there and let the pot fumes permeate the essence of my being...it was HELLA STRONG. But yah...at least it was worth it, I found something cool in HT that is, in fact, incredibly cool.  But otherwise, this day has been a real downer. When I ran today I was so tired that I passed out when I finally got back. But then I watched BET for a while and Chingy was on so that made up for it. Then I redecorated my room a bit and got my pedal board working, after having it broken for the last, what, six months?, so I was excited. Then I put up my pics of Abby on my nightstand and admired them for a while, she looks so nice. My mom went on another date tonite, and my sis was at Colour Guard, so again, I had the house to myself.  Alex is now officially my bitch. He said if I let him take this combat knife I have and stab it thru my door he would play anything I wanted him to. In fact, I let him do it four times. It doesn't matter since we're getting new ones, and he knows it, but still. My door looks hella wykd now, it's got a kick mark at the bottom from where my foot met it once, the beginnings of a scratching of "Stranglebox" in the wood, several dart marks, four knife marks, two of which went all the way thru, and a punch mark where Alex got miffed and decided that my door was to blame. I beat him mercilessly for that one, that was before my mom goes, "NU DOORS, W00t!" But still. He f-ing punched a hole in my f-ing door. *cry* No more privacy for me, not that I'm really doing anything to warrant any mistrust but still...my piggy had two and a half curls on the tail...har har har.  That personality test, the one with the pig, told me that I was optimistic or a realist...meaning I'm no longer a downer...WHAT? What happened? Did something profound strike my manically depressed soul in the past few days?  Actually, yes.  Been doing lots of thinking, and I figure the past isn't worth holding onto if it's covered in spikes, and that not every situation is exactly the same...I had that prob for a long time, that and thinking that the world was yin and yang, a balance in everything...it doesn't. Some things are one or the other and the world is good with that, and after all, it your perception of a matter that counts, not whether the situation is innately "good" or "bad".   So that's mein philosophics for the day. Congrats to all the Latin/German peeps for losing Shinky, I'm crying right along with you, you lucky bastards! And good luck to all, and to me too, for this wonderful year.  And dudes...we have to do Firehouse again, who's in?
