Lazyunistudent posted a comment regarding the interlinkages of livelihoods and well-being for the people I'm researching in Jiuzhaigou... and a whole lot of stuff I've looked at today confirms that opinion -- that they have simply been interlinked for so long that there is a time-lag with regards to this changing people's thinking. A seminar I went to today about public services in Africa confirmed this with some research regarding education. Even when education is provided by the state, it takes a sixty year period for it to be totally integrated into the culture. It requires firstly that parents be educated -- they will then almost automatically school their children. It requires that inequalties be signifcantly reduced between the quality of education available for rich and poor. It requires improved health, in that sick families will often keep (especially girl) children home to care for sick familiy members. AND it requires a diversified local economy, in that there has to be a reason for people to be educated -- if the only livelihood option available is farming, then there is no point wasting time and money being educated.  So for Jiuzhaigou, until recently, health (i.e. strength in their view) has been essential for the types of jobs available in their local economy -- farming, small businesses outdoors servicing tourists in all weather and so forth. Also they haven't had government handouts until 2001, so of course they have not got used to the idea that they don't have to earn a livelihood yet.  Secondly, I chatted to a development studies friend who pointed out that health is not the point of my thesis and I just needed to choose how I was approaching well-being, note the limitations and go forth with writing it up.   My supervisor later said the same thing, basically. That I had supported my decision to look at livelihoods fairly well, and to note that it was not strictly necessary according to present conditions for people to feel this way about well-being, but that according to their history and their distrust of the government it made sense.  So there we go.
