Yes, I"m still sick, but being home alone, sick has made me realize a few things that also make me laugh.  Go figure.  I have discovered my hatred of caller ID.  Since my parental units are not within shouting distance, I am now refusing to answer the phone if I know its not for me.  This is disturbing, as I realize I've become one of THOSE people.  Before you know it, I"ll have an answering machine and I won't be answering until the person on the other end starts saying..'Rian, i know your home...pick up Rian...'.  How rude!  Also, I've realized for probably only the second time in my life, that I lead with my heart.  Within the past 12 hours, I've spilt my heart (well, not my heart, but my true emotional feelings) and I've been burned....again.  Although the again is not necessarily referring to the same person.  I"m not stupid to spill twice and get burned.  And as always, I say i will be more careful with who I trust with my true feelings.  However, I know that in a month, or a year, I"ll be back here saying the same thing. Maybe its true what people say....what is it that people say?  I dunno.  And I don't care.  I"m becoming jaded. Bite me world of indifference!  However, I have gone through the day without seeing that damned Exorcist: The Prequel commerical.  The day might not be over, but I"m fairly confidant that i won't see it.  So I"m considering this a good day.   Random thought for the day: Why did they replace Belle Black three times in two weeks?  Or more importantly, how many Floridian's will it take to relect G. W. Bush, Jr?
