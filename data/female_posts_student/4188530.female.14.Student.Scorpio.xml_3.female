First of all I'm pissed at Mr. Strock for making us do another run-through. Run-through your pots Mr. Strock! Sorry but yeah being in the brass line and all we get to be in the back and while we're trying to get in to put our instruments away the woodwinds are in the way. Well we're fixing the whole thing tomorrow so it won't be a big deal anymore really. Enough about that. Hmm... I realized I did a ton more work than I had to in English so I was like laughing at my whole stupidity. For moment I think I have the feeling of one those people that's like about to blow their shoes off. The school work is finally getting to me but it's too soon. I'm not going to let some stupid paper make me go crazy. If it's a battle that paper wants, a battle it shall get. I think I just declared war on a paper. I thought I still had some insanity left. Although right now I'm dealing with some stuff that's been acrossing my mind so I'm a little better. However there is a moral to this story... can someone get me some watermelons I swear I can't remember what a fricking watermelon tastes like. That's not it but it's better than nothing. How about this. Say No to drugs and wear people in tutus.
