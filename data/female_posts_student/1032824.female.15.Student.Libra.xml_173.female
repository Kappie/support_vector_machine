I had different answers for the Compre multiple-choice section when I compared my question paper with Karen, Jeremy and Amelia. As for Paper 1, Mdm Liu Jian kind of spotted the  Gong-Han  question for us already, so many thanks to  lao-shi ! Then, I attempted Question 4 on Whether we thought Singapore was an Ideal Homeland. Anyways, I would also like to thank my Chinese tuition  lao-shi ! I love you lao-shi! :) Thank you so much for sacrificing your time for us. Lao-shi taught me not to give up and put in my best in whatever I did, and most importantly,  pray . So KUDOS to  lao-shi ! Most importanly, I would like to thank my family members who have been constantly praying for me. :) Mommy thanks for the essence of chicken, hee hee, and Daddy, thanks for all the car-rides! You guys rock me and my peanut butter! In addition, many thanks to: Mrs Chua, Mrs Raja, Fiona, Nanoko, Amily (with all her blesses), Jiax, Karen, YongJie, Kalyn, Hamann, LayChoo, Narin, Brian, Sheena and all the people who wished me luck via. phone, etc. (I'm sorry if I left anyone out!)     Anyways, Jeremy, Simon, Fiona, Geets, Jiax and I went to see  The Day After Tomorrow  which was incredible. A mixture of Sci, Romance, Humour, Family. The type of movie you would never regret watching. Amazing! :) After that I got home and because I was bored and didn't want to touch my books, I went walk-a-jog! ALONE. :( * Sniffle * Haa haa. Because Kalyn dear went on a shopping spree in town. But anyhow I saw Ma'am Vivian! I should jio her to go jogging next time since we live in the same block. Hee hee :) Anyone who lives around Bt Batok, let me know if you would like to work out. Because I would be moving back to Bt Timah soon.. Yupp, so I would like to spend more time to get to know Bt Batok. I've been living here for about 4 years already, but I still have no idea where Avenue 3, etc. is. What a dork.    Well, I'm really glad that it's all over. I love you all! * Huggles! *
