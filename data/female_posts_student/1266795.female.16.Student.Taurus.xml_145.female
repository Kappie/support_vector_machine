You all might hate it, but I like it. This has not been the best summer, and I want to put it behind me a.s.a.p. Seriously, not a happy Ashley tonight.  :-(  I'll get over it. There's some people I need to talk to though, and after that I should feel better. But yeah. Highlight of my summer so far I went to see the air show. I love it every year, but this year it was sooooo great. It was beautiful weather and I got to see the P 51 mustangs fly. yay! I am so going to fly one day. Seriously. It's my dream, and it has been since like 5th grade.  Betcha didn't know that, right? I'm also going to join the air force. More on this when I feel like writing. "The strawberries and pineapples are having a nice, big family reunion. What were you thinking?"
