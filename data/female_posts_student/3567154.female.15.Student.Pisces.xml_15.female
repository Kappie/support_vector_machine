I thought that ast night i still had really strong feelings for him but i think i was just in the moment. Today he came up to optimist where i was working and brenden was working with me and it was the worst thing ever. I finaly relized that i want to be with Brenden for a while and Jake is just like always there afarid to let go. Even Kim told me she doesn't think that Jake is getting it throught his head. I talked to Jake just a lil ago i stoped writing to talk to him. He said he might go out with Kristelle again. I don't really care anymore. Well i do but i just don't want to confess that i do. Life is so confusing to me. I just know that i want to stay with Brenden for a while. I do love Jake don't let urself be fooled there. It is just that i feel like i love him too much! is that posable? Well i guess now it is!!! O well. I'll write more tomorrow i must go watch eurotrip now ttyl
