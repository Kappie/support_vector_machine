 until I had the time to get everything properly organized... you know,
 the cast list, the all-about-me page, the cool links set up... but, I
 just want to write. So, all of that can wait. I'll explain as I go
 along for now and get to the details later. 

 In Sunday school with the three-year olds, we were talking about Palm Sunday. 
 
 Me:  And the people of Jerusalem were   so  
 excited that Jesus was coming to their city that they put their clothes
 down on the road so he wouldn't get muddy. And they waved--

 Danielle:  Teacher... *tugs on my pant leg* 

 Me:  Yes?

 Danielle:  Teacher...  *with a look of horrified fascination on her face*  Does that mean they were   NAKED??  

 Me:   *stifling laughter*  No, Danielle. It was only their   extra   clothes, like their coats.

 Danielle:  Oh, and like their sweatshirts?

 Me:  Yeah, like that.
  Seriously,
 what else can you say to that? It was a pefectly logical question...
 and next time, I'll make sure to say they put their    coats    down, not their clothes!
