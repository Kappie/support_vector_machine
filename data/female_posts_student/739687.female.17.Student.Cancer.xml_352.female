I'm just waiting for my moment.*  You know what I've realized? I did a great thing. I won over my enemies with unfaltering kindness. For months...I never sunk down to their level. I refused to fight back when they verbally attacked me. I stood strong, even when it was so tempting to fight.  And for a while I was losing hope that I would ever accomplish anything out of it. But even through my doubt I  never  echoed a word of spite.  And I've come to realize that...it worked.  I feel like a stronger, better person from that. I used to think that just taking discriminations and accusations without fighting back would hurt my *oh so precious pride*, but in the end I feel much more proud than I ever would have.  :)  I kick ass.  Haha  "The loss of friends, you didn't have..."  Anyway, things are okay. Not to say that they are good, because they aren't.  Life is adequate enough right now that I can wait things out...let things calm down (hopefully).  Sort of. C'est la vie. Parfois, j'ai peur du futur...j'ai peur que ma vie devenira un grand disastre. Je dit souvent (et plus souvent je le pense): "Ceci est ma  destruction fantastique." Et c'est vrai...Ma vie est ma destruction. C'est une drame...une drame fanastique. Et je deteste la drame. Mais JE SUIS une drame...Est-ce que je deteste moi-meme? Non...je deteste ma vie. It's sad really. Mais je ne le deteste que parfois.  Okay...most a good amount of time. It just kind of comes and goes. It empties, refills, and cyles through and through.  Okay, fing Physics.  I hate Physics crazies. Don't you?
