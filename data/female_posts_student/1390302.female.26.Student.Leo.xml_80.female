Breaking out the 2nd ed. Books and giving it another go!  We’ve decided that with all of the inconsistencies of 3rd edition, we just couldn’t take it anymore.  Something is wrong with a system that allows you to level up one level per night if challenged!  It makes me wonder if these-guys even play tested the thing!  So with a great deal of hope we turn back the pages of D history for a system that is truly a work of art. A gaming masterpiece in its own time, 2nd edition has been tossed to the curb for a system that frightfully and sadly could have been something great under the right game designers.  I frown upon you Wizards of the Coast!    Of course there is no offense intended for those who enjoy the system, I simply say that we don’t!  So wish us luck in our endeavor to break out the ol’ time machine and traverse to the golden days of gaming!  ~Kristyn
