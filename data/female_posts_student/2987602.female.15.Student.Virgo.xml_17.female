Yesterday we took Dani out for a movie, Spiderman 2 it was OK i personally liked it better than the 1st but like most of them didnt, then we went back to Christina's house and suprised Dani w/ a party! Well not really a party we just kinda set her basement up w/ balloons and signs and stuff... But like then Tory came and she definately wasnt expecting that so she was very suprised lol. We had pizza, cake and then watched I Know What You Did Last Summer, and we just hung out. I had a good time. We had a balloon war, and invented a new game, and I ran on the treadmill for awhile. Dani opened her presents, and at the end we popped the ballons. That was really hard lol. I had to like jump really hard to pop them, and then I was tryig to sit on one balloon to pop it and then I was bouncing on it and then Tory popped it while I was in midair so i landed on Christina's rock hard floor and hurt my butt!!! ouch!!! Don't worry, one day soon i'll recover. Well i think that's all for now. I'll update soon b/c ino it will crush you if I don't lol...
