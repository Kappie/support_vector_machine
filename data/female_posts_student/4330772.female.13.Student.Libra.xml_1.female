Man I hope George Bush doesn't win. I'm not saying that John Kerry will solve all our problems, but I think he'll do a better job.  If any of you are reading this, I need some help. What kind of digital camera should I get? I'm a tad bit clueless, and I need one before September 11th, when I am to be attending the Franz Ferdianand concert.
