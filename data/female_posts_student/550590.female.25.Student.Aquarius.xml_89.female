Take it away cuz I don't want it anymore...oh, and while you're at it, do you want to go to Orlando this weekend and spend it with my family doing absolutely nothing for the third weekend in a row?    At least last weekend I got to see Thomas who my father had affectionately dubbed "Top of the Shitlist."  His reign however has been short lived seeing as he has once again been replaced by David.  Well, more the 16 year old bitch David used to call his girlfriend than David himself...but he's not on my good list either right now.
