The main threats to it are from factories dumping, governments not regulating, and logging. The first two are easily preventable, but the third, which causes a large percentage of the damage is not so easily stopped. The logging is mostly in countries like Brazil or the Congo, where the people rely on it for a living. The logging industry provides work for thousands of people there, and the land cleared provides farming land for thousands more, whose food provides sustance to millions. If the environmental activists had their way, these people would all starve, and it would severely depress the economies of these growing countries, hurting even those who arent in the logging industry.  In the first world countries like Australia, the U.S., or even Tasmania (maybe a two and a half world country), the logging should be cut down on, at least in first growth forests. Also, Uma Thurman is the hottest chick alive, and Jennifer Aniston is the best girl next door.  Admin. This just in- James is gya.
