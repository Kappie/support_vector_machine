Aside from some well-shot (though overlong) ballet sequences, the movie is a sloppy, ill-conceived, unreleasable mess. Still, a friend of mine notes that Altman has achieved the nearly impossible: He's made a two-hour film about dance which features not a single openly Gay character. That's like making a film about jazz with no Black people. So much for the director's legendary "honesty."   Heh.  This blog is quickly becoming one of my favorites.
