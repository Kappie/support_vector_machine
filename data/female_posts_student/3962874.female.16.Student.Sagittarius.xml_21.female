Sure we hung out once and a while but not like we used to. I missed my friend and we had an awesome time. Kit and Sarah are both really really hyper so they all jump around and entertain me and Kayla. We seriously laughed all day today. I was flashed by Sarah at least 20 times. Oh yeah and we taught Sarah how to drive my car. She has a car and her liscense and everything but she had never learned how to drive a stick. So we taught her. And amazingly enough she only killed it like four times of driving like all over the place. She did so good I was jelous. She started on her second try. Wow. I think I witnessed a miracle. If I didn't mention before, I was also the one (along with my dad) who taught Sarah how to actually drive, an automatic. It was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. We went down some hill and almost flew off the road. My dad was reaching for the steering wheel the whole time. But now she's good. With a little practice, things do get better. Oh yeah and today we watched Moulin Rouge (Sarah and I's all time favorite movie), we know most all of the words and definately all the songs. We sang all of them, and Kayla, Kit and Daniel had really never seen the movie before so they yelled at us the whole time. It was great. At the end of the day when I was driving them down to the ferry, we decided to go drive by the swimming hole and flash the people there. Guess who was there? All the islanders who hang out at my house. Sarah stood out my sun roof and started to flash them but she chickened out so I had to drive by again, and this time, I honked the horn tons of times and everyone looked just in time to see her. LOL. It was great.
