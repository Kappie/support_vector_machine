I asked about how bullets work, how they are shot, I loaded the clip, looked down the barrel.  It was a small gun, a 22.  Lighter then I ever would have imagined, so much easier then I would have thought.  It was me and three men.  All of them had shot before.  We were up on BLM or National Forest land.  The wind was blowing, cold, and sunny in the early afternoon, clouds rushing through the valley and snow in contrast patches on the ground.  We shot at cans mostly.  The first time it went off, when my friend was trying it out, I flinched hard.  I was startled by the pitch of it, the higher groan bang of it.  Till we got through the first ten rounds I blinked hard at every shot.  At one point I became aware of the sour tang of gun powder floating in the air.  We smelled like it.  The casings flew to the right, jumped a good six feet before landing.  They were so small.  I loaded the clip, learning to push in the bullets with my thumb, learning the oil feel of the copper tip of the bullet, watching as I made cans jump into the air, making the first solid shot on a coke can that had been giving us problems.  My heart beat in time to the shots, fast and loud, confused.  Guns are grey.  At one point they were not so grey, more black and white.  I am not sold on guns, and I don't think that I will be a member of the NRA anytime soon, but there was a strange solidarity to it as well.  Standing on a windy day with my friends, my boys, taking turns, watching and making comments, becoming more steady, learning how not to shake when I realized that there was a possible death in my hands, becoming confident with loading and slowly, evenly, firing.  Weapons are a strange place for me.  They are made, for the most part, as tools of violence to use against other people.  This, for me, is bad.  On the other hand, I don't want the people in power to be the only ones with these weapons.  I trust my friend who owns this gun.  He is educated about it, careful, respectful of it, and gentle with his knowledge about it.  There is no way to know about people.  Shooting was easy, simple in the motions and the stance, and though I am not a pro I know that I could shoot this gun again with out trouble.  It was simple, and it was very complicated, understanding the inner works of me in it.  I expected to be very excited, or unimpressed.  I expected some strong gut reaction.  Truth is, I did like it.  It is something I would like to learn to do decently, something that I should know more about.   It was not, however, the biggest high of my life.  I was nervous, but after two rounds that wore down.  I want to go shooting again.  One of my friends said that we should all get a gun, so that we can go together and not switch off.  I don't know how I feel about that.  You see, I feel that to have a gun of my own, I would have to understand it all, and I would have to be willing to use it for its purpose- to shot someone.  It was not built for shooting cans, or coyotes, but humans.  It is something to contemplate, but I feel more educated, which I think is always good.
