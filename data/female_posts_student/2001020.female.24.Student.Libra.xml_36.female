Maybe that has something to do with it. And my hands are sticky from the orange juice I was just drinking. I didn't get drunk last night, just sat around with my friends D, A, A, and D's fiancee D. We talked about E, therapeutic, but doesn't solve shit. D (the fiancee) has his male theories about how E probably isn't feeling bad about what he did now, but in the long run, he'll realize that he's not gonna meet another girl like me. Greeeeat. I wish I didn't have to believe that all men are fucking scumbags. But I've got a guy telling me that it's really just about testosterone and it's not about who, it's about when. Is this the reality of it? If so, it is pointless to date and fall in love...they're always searching for someone! If it's not you, it'll be someone else to stick their dick in. Ugh, don't want to think about this bullshit anymore.
