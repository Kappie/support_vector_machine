I applied in late May I think, or maybe early June. They called yesterday and the guy was really nice and today I have an interview!! Yay for me! I just hope it goes well so I can start earning back some of the money I so recently spent on clothes!  Oh and I'm feeling better to anyone who was wondering. I can actually swallow and breathe through my nose! Great timing with the interview and all!! YAAAAAAAAAAY!
