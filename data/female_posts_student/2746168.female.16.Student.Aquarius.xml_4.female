See at the bottom of every post where it says "# Comments"? (It'll probably say 0 on whatever you're looking at.) If you click on that, you'll be taken to a page that has just that one post on it. On that page will be a link saying, "Post a comment." Clicking on those words opens up a box where you can leave comments about what you just read. It's pretty swanky, and you should try it if you wanna voice your thoughts or just drop us a line down here. Go on, I dare you. =)
