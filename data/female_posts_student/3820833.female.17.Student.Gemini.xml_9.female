Besidesthe practices,assignments and Add maths homework pile up like mountain, when can I finish them?? Help me!!    I attended a birthday party last night. It’s boring. I did not talk much in the party. Maybe I’m not sociable. Further more, I was not feeling well last night. Fever. Haih… =(   Final competition count down - 3 days.
