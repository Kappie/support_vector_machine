So, last night I was supposed to have a sleepover with Braun, but apparently when she was getting her ears pierced she pissed her mom off somehow, and she could only hang out for the night. So I'm talking to her on MSN, and then 5 minutes after she told me she couldn't have a sleepover she said she couldn't do anything at all because she was arguing with her mom and she swore, or something to that effect. So, I called Kailie and My dad and I went to pick her up and we watched a movie, then decided we wanted to go to 7-11. So we're almost out the door and Autumn phones me and says she's off grounding for the night and asked if I wanted to sleep over. So we picked her up and went walking around a little bit, then I got Kailie to get her dad to pick her up from Autumn's house, and then I just slept at Autumn's, and left at about 2:30 this afternoon. Yep, that's my day.  And then after supper my dad took me driving. I  hate  driving with my dad, because he's  always  bitching/yelling at me about something, like if I make one mistake he'll tear my head off about it. And when he does that, I get really nervous and end up screwing up worse and then he yells at me more...lol...I'm getting used to it but still! It's fucking annoying! And then I tell him to stop yelling at me, and he's like "I'm not" and he's semi-civilized for like 2 minutes or until I make another mistake...he should fuck off...today was my second practice day, and I was in that fucking truck which I hate! Oh well...today we were in the Superstore parking lot, because Superstore closes at 6:00pm on Sundays, so I basically had the entire parking lot to myself. There were just a couple other cars driving around aimlessly (like me), and I'm guessing they were students practicing because I don't think if someone had their licence they would sit there driving around the Superstore parking lot...that and they were driving at half the speed of smell...but I can't complain because I was driving that slow too. But hey you're supposed to drive slow in parking lots! And anyways so we're done practicing for the day, and he's driving home and he stops the truck about 160ft before the train tracks heading towards Centennial School on Dalgliesh (I had figured he had run out of gas; he made a comment earlier on how he was almost out of gas) and he looks at me and says, "Ok, drive home from here." To say the least I was nervous. But I actually was ok! I had to drive 40, which seemed fast at first but I started to get used to it then had to slow down cuz we had to turn off of Dalgliesh (I'm...still not used to it). You may think 40 is really slow, but try being used to 15-20 for 2 days then having to switch to 40-45 just like that! But yeah I did alright...I'm way better in the streets than in a parking lot for some reason...Probably because the street is a way wider space, and that seems to work for me. Meh.  Anywho I've run out of topics to turn into bloggedy goodness so, later!   -Joebie
