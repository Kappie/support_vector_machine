Apparently Tommy's mom said Tommy should ask me out. Let me explain...Ok, Tommy made a quote list for me. Well yesterday he showed his mom the quotes, and his mom told him that he should ask me out because I seem nice and funny. I didn't believe Tommy, but then he promised me it was true, and even told me I could ask Bobby about it. I decided not to ask Bobby, but to just believe Tommy. I just find that funny. Nothing else exciting happened today. It was an average Tuesday. Maybe tomorrow will be more exciting.
