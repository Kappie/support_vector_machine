Anyway's I did that. And then Daniel and I went to Target to pick up a birthday present for his nephew (Ryan) because I totally forgot it was his birthday. Then we went to his birthday party and all of that was done by 8:30. Then Zack came over to my mom's house and we hung out for a while. We were going to watch a movie but Zack had to by home by 11 so we didn't really have time, so instead we decided to go drive around which ended up being really boring. Then we came back here and have been sitting around doing not much at all. Zack has to leave really soon and my foot itches really bad because apparently there is some mysterious nasty spider in my bed who likes to bte my toes. One night I got two bites on my second smallest toe and then lastnight I got two more, one on my big toe and one on the toe next to it. It itches so bad I want to cry. Anyway, I really need to go shopping because I have some money now and I need to start buying school stuff. Mom said something about going to a movie tomarrow we are thinking about seeing the Bourne Identity but I don't know if I want to waste money, I think I would rather buy clothes.
