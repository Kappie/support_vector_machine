Anyway... yeay! I'm going on Saturday at 2am! AHHHH! Well it should be fun, we get to meet a non *well kind of* materialistic society! *is there such a thing?* We're learning about cultures in English.... does ours suck? We've got the whole rich / poor divide, we've still got racism, sexism etc and we still have corruption. There will always be one person who sticks to this though, sad aye? *sorry if i'm talking shit, i'm hot and tired!*
