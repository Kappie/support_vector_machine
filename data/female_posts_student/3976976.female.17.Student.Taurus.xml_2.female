Time By Â©GinnyStorm Time is sleeping softly now,  As though it will never awaken;  And here, now, in this moment,  My heart is being taken. This day will last forever,  Though I know that it's only a day.  And soon, you will have left me,  Like a cloud floating away.  And yet, time is looking right at us,  And this hour will never end.  But time is ever cruel-hearted,  And like a thief, is stealing my friend.  This second will last an eternity,  As seconds sometimes do;  And I can say that I have spent Eternity with you.  One moment can last a lifetime,  And though we soon will part,  I vow that I will always love This thief that stole my heart.
