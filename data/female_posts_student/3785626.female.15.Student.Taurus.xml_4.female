I did nothing, then about noon I went to the store, got some stuff. I saw Claire. Then I went home and did nothing. Called Tregory about 3. Wheee! Fun. Then I did nothing. Now I'm doing nothing. Tregory called a few minutes ago. I'm so Happee!! Lol He got to go shopping. Lucky him...Anyways I think I'm going to stay up ALL night. I'm bored. I have nothing better to do. I don't wanna go to sleep really. I might clean the whole frikkin' house, who knows. Anyways I'll holla. 3 Cherry//Boredom Has Struck
