It was goldenSOMETHING.com ;) My preliminary searches turned up nothing but milk  cookies to the person that can hunt it down.  I don't claim to know much about competing in an Olympics or any sort of national/international events (shock horror!), but I was slightly disturbed by Leisel Jones'  urlLink comments  after her  urlLink shock finish  in 3rd in her pet event the 100m breaststroke:    "I guess I'm just not meant to win," a deflated Jones said, no doubt remembering winning silver at the Sydney 2000 Games as a 15-year-old.... "I believe thoroughly that things happen for a reason so this obviously means something."    Yes, it means that you're unable to perform when the pressure's on; when it really matters. Some would even call you a choker:   choker  noun 2: an unfortunate person who is unable to perform effectively because of nervous tension or agitation; "she could win if she wasn't a choker"  from Dictionary.com   But nonetheless, she'll be back for Beijing and maybe then, she can shake the tags off.  The mens gymnastics team final last night saw the USA winning their first mens team medal in gymnastics from a non-boycotted Games (should 1984 medals really count at all? :P) and it also saw a little success for the Romanian men in the form of a bronze medal. I guess it must be nice after sitting back and watching the women dominate and wni the medals. I've decided I prefer the womens gymnastics to the mens because I like the events more; I'd rather watch the uneven bars and the beam than the rings and the high bar.   Coming up next post : Canadian swimming (disaster), Aussie women in beach volleyball, feel-good story of the day  white water kayaking.   p.s.  Hugs to  urlLink Barista  for linking my blog in a 8/17 post - isn't it just the little things that make your day that much better?
