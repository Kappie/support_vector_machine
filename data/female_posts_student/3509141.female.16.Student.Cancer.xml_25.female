I guess feelings like that don't flow easily to parents. Anyways, I told him to go away, repeatedly. Then he got mad and got a broom stick to scare me. I new I couldn't fight him so I left for a walk in the cold. On my way out, he said that if I left, he'd lock the door and not let me back in. I didn't even hesitate, I had a key in my pocket. I distanced myself from my house. As I walked, I thought and talked to God. I realized what scared me so much about my parents. I didn't no if their love for me was like God's, totally and absolutely unconditional, or if they would abandon me as soon as they got news that I failed to get into the university of their choise. The more I thought about it, the more I believed it was the latter. It was cold and since I was wearing a t-shirt, I turned to go home earlier than I would've. Nevertheless, I dreaded going home. All I could imagine were my parents going on about how stupid it was to just walk out like that. On my way back, however, my mom found me. I didn't even c her since I was looking at the ground. She brought my sweatshirt and jacket. So... maybe she really loves me after all. I don't no. And there hasn't been a lecture, at least, not yet. I've been avoiding my dad since I came in so I haven't talked to him yet. And I haven't talked to my mom either.  So, what now? What else is gonna happen? Will we resolve our problems and be one big happy family? What will happen tommorow? And ya, I was crying. I was crying when I walked around outside and I'm crying now. I don't care about image. Think of me as a sissy who cries a lot if u want. I don't care. I'm just so sick and tired about not noing if it'll get better or worse. I g2g again. Cya tommorow.
