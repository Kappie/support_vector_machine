Because I didn't really remember what he looked like, and then I was like 'oh yeah...damn he was hotter than I remembered.' So I guess I will have to make it a point to answer those phone calls more often and...hang out and shit.  So last night was adventure night and even though it wasn't a super-insane outrageous adventure of death it was pretty cool. And I ended up in the back of a police vehicle. ;)  Hahaha I'm so dumb.  Keller is starting to feel more and more like a small town. Maybe it's because everywhere you turn you run into someone.  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  Yuuuuuup  Okay okay I'm done that's enough.  Oh oh I added commenting to my blog. Please feel free to use or abuse.  blah blah crazies *boom*
