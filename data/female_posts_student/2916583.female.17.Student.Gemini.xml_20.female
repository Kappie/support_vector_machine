I must have eaten five Krispy Kreme.  Sooo good but so fattening.  I can feel my stomach going from sticking out to pot belly.  God help me if I ever become an alcoholic.   Anyway, this girl in my chemistry class found my site and checked it out.  More and more people are starting to read this!  I better keep the I. trashing to a minimum...that wouldn't be good if my site went the way of the "Girls of Chester" (a site describing all the Chester sluts).  Anyway, I'm just waitin for my mom to come so I can go home and do some MORE hilighting.  I've already gone through 100 pages.  I'm tired of hilighting!  I really want to take a nap, but I should probably make some progress on my research paper. Oh so many pimples erupting on my face from Krispy Kreme goo! Well I should probably wrap this one up.  Let me just get some Quizilla results on here and I'm done.  Later.    Pop punk...  I'm not really that fond of you, but you can churn out some good stuff...  Old punk doesn't really like you but you couldn't care less...besides it's all about having fun isn't it?    urlLink   What genre of rock are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Good Charlotte!  Yay!
