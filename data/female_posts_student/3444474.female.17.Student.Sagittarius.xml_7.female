Go me, and go Greg for being so damn creative :P  On a completely unrelated topic, I have wasted away another day. I'm good like that.   Ooooh, Sic Transit Gloria just came on...yay Winamp, and yay Brand New. :D  I don't know why I like such depressing music sometimes.   I mean, this whole song is about this guy's sexual experience with a girl that will never love him...there's other stuff in there too, but mainly...it sounds like it goes badly.   "He whispers that he loves her but she's probably only in it for the s-..."   I mean c'mon, lol.   I think that I like the music because...it sounds a lot like my love life, from my perspective, and the perspective of those I dated in the past.   Messed up, isn't it?  I've only had a few relationships that weren't totally fucked in some way.   Make that like...one, lol.   In another completely unrelated topic, I really wish I could get out more.   I mean...go out with my friends. Unfortunately, most of my friends are boys. This in mind, my mother thinks I'm going to go out and fuck all of them, because I would do such a thing, right?  And in the past, yes, I would've, because I was completely immoral back then, and really didn't give a shit about me, or my body, or what anyone really thought about it. But I'm different now. And I suppose she doesn't totally trust me, and that's okay. Eventually she will. One day.   When I'm married with my three kids and my dog in suburbia, lol.   And even then...maybe she won't.   She and I have been good lately though. Which is nice. No arguing, no screaming matches, no calling me a whore or me calling her a bitch.   It's been peaceful.   I like this.   And I think that me moving out in August will be good for us.   I'll grow up, and she'll let go.   It will be a marvelous thing. :)  I hate missing people, but there are only a few people that I will really miss...they know who they are.   More later, when I feel like posting something meaningful.
