So I just thought I'd write you back to say "Hello!"   And I have to go to confirmation....boooooooooo. It sucks so bad. He acts like the St. Pats kids are so much better than the public school kids, it pisses me off. They know more about the bible, sure, but how about music! Boo-yah, bihatch! Just messin, had to get that out before I went. So now I will write you an e-mail until I leave.   I am very nervous for tryouts. I think I will get the routine down soon, I know the first part, I just need to piece it all together. I don't think I will make it, but I will try my hardest anyway! I just have a request though, if I don't make it, please don't say your sorry or anything. Just pat me on the shoulder or something. I just don't want to be told that people are feeling sorry for me.     I just thought i'd put that in my weblog so ya'll know what I've been doin. Not like anyone reads this, but what the hey! Go to www.geocities.com/queen_orda06 to tell me if you are reading this! Well, that's my life! Gotta go to confirmation...peace out homies. HA!
