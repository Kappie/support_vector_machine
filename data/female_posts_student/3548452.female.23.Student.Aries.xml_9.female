People get mugged other places but rarely do you ever hear of it happening here. I dont feel afraid to walk down the street by myself; these streets were my playground growing up. If I ever doubted that they were, just being alive and well and being able to have a neighborhood bar "where everybody knows your name" like the song says, lets me know I"ve earned this right to be here and to love my city as much as I damn well please and you may not like it, but that's too fucking bad. I love Flint. You can talk about how bad it is here all you want, but I dont see it that way. I have lots of family that isnt by blood- especially on the eastside- which everybody thinks is so bad. They say we have prostitutes- there's prostitutes on S. Dort, but ya dont see them talkin about that like they do ours. There's some on Saginaw Street but ya dont hear em talkin about that either. Really there's a prostitute or slut pretty much everywhere you go, but for some reason it's not talked about unless it's on a "bad" side of town- but all four sides are bad so what's the difference? I guess the reason why I'm saying all this is because I feel totally out of place taking my friends to my "neighborhood" bars... I have three right now- Art's Pub on Lewis (yes lewis street where the hookers are LOL), Jans Tavern on Davison Rd, and Ragtop used to be my absolute favorite but they are closed. Ragtop is the home of the Big Ass Burger- guaranteed to give you a big ass *grins*. Hiller's is across the street and they're okay too but, I like my big crowds and bein able to hang out and get a lil rowdy. :D Last night I was at Art's- havent been there in at least 5 years (yes thats right, I was a youngn when I was in there shhhhh!) and my friend Lori manages it so I promised her I would come out. I get there and not only is Lori there, Crystal is (girl from highschool) and just a bunch of people. My big brother Steve is there and then here comes the karaoke guy. I'm a country gal at heart myself so when this big tall guy comes in with his cowboy hat and boots and his nice fittin' jeans on, I just sat back an drooled. I heard my new favorite song all the way through last night too- Redneck Woman oh yea I will be singin that hot puppy a lot. It was fun once again to just sing my heart out and get to hang out with some of my fellow eastsiders, friends, people that i've known for years. Danced with that cute Karaoke guy Scott a couple times *drools* and got to meet some really cool new people, ogle some hot boys, just have a really good time. It reminds me of the good old days when I had just turned 18. Me and my friend April went to the bar 7 nights a week to do karaoke and it was between Arts and Ragtop every night with our favorite Karaoke Host, CK. Ya ever notice how most karaoke guys (not the ladies) are either very preppy or very country- even CK wears like, the nice dress shirts and the nice pants... and he's bout as down to earth and eastsider as they come LOL. I love him tho. I go to JW's too, but considering my panic attack the other day, I prolly wont go there much lmao. Oh- my cheeks hurt from laughing and smiling so much... there is something to be said about being able to just have a good time with no fights, no shootings, no arguments- nothing at the bar. Most places, there is at least one. The last couple weeks goin to my favorite neighborhood bar, there hasnt even been a skirmish that couldnt be resolved before I knew about it.
