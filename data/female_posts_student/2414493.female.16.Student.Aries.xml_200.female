My back just did a lovely crack--it must be from all this slouching. I think there's an actual indentation in my flesh where I slouch. My back makes a lovely c-shaped curvature when I'm on the piano bench. People don't like it. I do, it's comfy. Too much effort sitting up straight anyways, wouldn't you agree?  My day: coming home, showering, some simplex, cereal, nap, dinner, orchestra, SAT scores and sitting down for 2 hours 1 minute and counting. I was getting milk for the Cinnamon Toast Crunch when I seriously wondered what I would be doing otherwise, if I did have something exigent to take care of. I shrugged it off. That's how apathetic I am. In fact, boredom headaches are common these days. The climax today was probably the SAT scores, which isn't even exciting at all.  Ellis is sending me music. Wonderful!  Anna couldn't stop talking about how Irene should have been secretary. Maybe she doesn't understand. NHS offices are determined by popular approval, not handwriting like 12pt Times. I can't pinpoint why I don't really get along with Irene--I used to. I don't know if it's change in me or change in her, but sadly I don't miss the friendship much. It's almost this unwillingness to change, remaining forever the hardcore student. It's almost a fobbishness, too, but I don't like to admit that. Nigel says you can totally tell if a person was born here or somewhere else. It's a certain awkwardness detectable in Barbara, in Irene, in Tyffany. I don't think there would have been enough support for Irene. I'm not the only one who thinks there's something not right.   But in pinpointing what I don't like about other people, I wonder what has changed in me. Like most other people, I couldn't even go back to freshman year and say I liked myself back then. I changed in some indistinguishable point sophomore year. Maybe it was mock trial. Or the trio. Or Tiff and Nige. Every year I get out of school and swear that these past ten months were the best ever. And maybe I'm being truthful. But I know I'm growing up. I like it, but I almost feel guilty saying that I'm having a good time as if teenage apathy and wishfulness were standard. But think about it: I'm surrounded by great people. School's actually holding up ok, I won't have to worry too much. I do the things that make me happy. I like what I see in the mirror...to a certain extent. I don't do major drama. I have peanut butter and jelly for lunch. Life is good.  I need sleep. Yawn.
