The only things to do here are either to hang out in front of wal-mart and smoke.  I personally wouldn't consider that fun.  The other choice is to go to applebees and then a movie.  Even when we go eat I always get the same thing.  One day when I drive, Veronica and I are going to go to the "big city" and walk around downtown.  She also mentioned we should all go to Barnes and Noble or something which I think would be fun.  Any suggestions of things to do in a small town that's rather boring.  I want to go ice skating or something.  Something would be along the lines of going to the "big city." I mean when I go hang out with Maury all we do is go eat, go to a movie, or go to a play.  I've gotta find something new to do.  Have I mentioned that yet?
