Gary and Katie kept on teasing me everytime i missed the ball, saying very loudly that i was "distracted", which i'll admit it...i was!  Their bodies were so perfect and sculpted and omg i'll never forget that day.  They were sweaty and hot and rolling around in the sand.....oh man, best day of this year i would think.  Too bad they're graduating and i won't get to stare at them for another year.  Anyways, back to the actual volleyball part of this story.  Me and Ashley spent most of the time trying to hit the ball and then running into each other, then getting distracted by the hott guys, then falling into the sand, then making the occasional good hit, hugging and celebrating, get distracted and start the cycle all over again.  After the hott guys left though, we started playing better....but then we were all too tired to do anything and we left.  It was all and all a good time, we should do it again next weekend.    Oh yeah and when i went to Quizno's to get dinner.....the guy who works there knew exactly what i was going to order!!!  with all my extra stuff and everything!!!  it was exciting, i guess i go there too much lol!   Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
