He said stuff has happened. We didn't have much time. But I apologized and he apologized more. And he meant it. And we hugged. And I feel so much better about it now.  He's a different kind of friend. But I think maybe, considering the apology was given, without any asking from me, that he's not all bad. And maybe I could possibly consider forgiving and being his friend.  It's so weird. We just  talked and were actually honest and I realized how much I had missed him. Not necessarily in a romantic way. Just as himself. It's weird to lose a good friend.  Only problem, in the chance that we do become friends?  EVERYONE ELSE WE KNOW.........
