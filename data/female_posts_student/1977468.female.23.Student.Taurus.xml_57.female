This usually is not difficult, seeing as how I rarely do my laundry I don't have much to wear anyway. Then I tranverse the expanses of the house multiple times, sitting in every chair and lying on every couch, and inspect each room accordingly. Then I go to the kitchen, and with my hands on my hips I assess my food options. After it's clear that I need to live at Wendy's for awhile, I call someone I know. It doesn't really matter who, I don't tell them I'm nake-ed. It's one of those inside jokes thats a  *really*  inside joke, as only I am a part of it. Then I sit down at my computer, and write in my blog.   Do you see where I'm going with this?  I'm nake-ed. Nake-ed as I type this. I hope this doesn't make you feel uncomfortable or anything.  Anyway moving on, I have a situation that needs attention. Somehow this girl called "Kiwicrgrl09" got on my buddy list, I have no idea how. I attempt communication with her regularly, but she continues to blow me off basically. This lead to questions... questions like "why"? Needless to say, I have begun to scientifically document the happenings as of late.

I'll give you one more chance. res0nation: Hey, it's person A.  res0nation: whats that? hmm... I think I know what must be going on here res0nation: your illiterate? res0nation: your probably making wild hand motions and crying out, trying to communicate. res0nation: Don't worry, I know you don't understand a word im saying. res0nation:  ME  res0nation:  WANT   res0nation:  TALK  res0nation:  YOU  res0nation: ...  res0nation: oh well, I give up. res0nation: Here's something to study up on though in the meantime.  il·lit·er·ate    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (-ltr-t) adj.   Unable to read and write.  Having little or no formal education.   Marked by inferiority to an expected standard of familiarity with language and literature.  Violating prescribed standards of speech or writing.  Ignorant of the fundamentals of a given art or branch of knowledge  res0nation:  NOW  res0nation:  BYE                     Notice in this article she did not return any notion suggestive of intelligent life. As everything about this person including the her origins and how she got on my list remains a mystery, it would be easy for one to assume that she is incapible of conversation or has no hands to type with. This is what I first started to believe as well, until this happened:  res0nation: woman of the kiwi! res0nation: it is I  res0nation: the guy who always IMs you with that very same line! res0nation: not feeling the love right now. not that you love me or anything. ok wait. res0nation: not feeling the attention res0nation: there we go res0nation: there's a certain amount of mileage that should follow along with being a person who has a mind and can type things. It should go at least as far as you responding. res0nation: I mean its not like im cussing you out or anything res0nation: ......................................... res0nation: GOSH! there's only 2 people logged in at this hour, you and some other guy who's boring! what do you expect! Kiwicrgrl09: what? Kiwicrgrl09: Hi Kiwicrgrl09: You should really do something more productive then res0nation: hey now res0nation: I just got off work res0nation: and that my friend is like the definition of productivity Kiwicrgrl09: where is that? res0nation: I am an officer of hygenic law res0nation: i.e janitor Kiwicrgrl09: cool Kiwicrgrl09: I'm going to bed, goodnight res0nation: sometimes th- huh1?

Previous message was not received by Kiwicrgrl09 because of error: User Kiwicrgrl09 is not available.  Note that although she responded in this instance, it was brief and barely conceptual. We do now know however  that she does sleep . It has occured to me that as much as I want to study this case, her perception towards my screen name is biased to say the least. Therefor I will conduct further expiriements in the near future under different names with different font colors and style of speaking, so that she does not suspect it is me. However, it would be much easier for me to remain as one of the masses if we created some masses, so  PLEASE FOLKS, ANNOY Kiwicrgrl09 AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE  .  I have been monitering her online-offline activity and have deducted that she is never on for more then an hour at a time, during very sparatic time intervels as you can see here.

The briefing is over, now get to work yall! Thank you. From now on I'll be adding quotes of interest. I bought a book about the early years of the Beatles so the first ones will be form that.  "They were doing four solos on one song, which was unheard of in those days; you'd do the song straight from the record. People stopped dancing. Instead they walked forward and just stood and watched. We thought, something strange is happening. The Beatles were jumping on chairs and smoking on stage, Paul McCartney was playing this guitar with four strings on, and Pete was pounding out his powerful drum beat- oh , and John Lennon was having a fight with someone at the back of the hall. What a night." - John McNally
