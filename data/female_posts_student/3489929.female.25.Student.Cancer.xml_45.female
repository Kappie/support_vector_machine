I'm so bored, I keep running my mouth to Lisa about a mile a minute about nothing at all, and I think it's starting to piss her off a little, since she can't watch her  Animal Planet  while I'm jawing.  I just feel like I finally regained some purpose in my life, and school just can't start quickly enough. I'm restless, and that's a dangerous state of mind for me, because I become unpredictable and a little reckless when I have nothing better to do.  Lord, please don't let me screw this up. Give me something to occupy my time for the next month-plus.  Please????
