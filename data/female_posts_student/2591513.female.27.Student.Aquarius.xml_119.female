UGH  The funny thing is that I took it off for bowling purposes, mainly and also because the upkeep of nails is very expensive for a broke soul like me.  I have been blogging a lot, are you guys getting bored yet?  haha  You know I was thinking the other day that my mind is like a sonstant ramble.  I have a bunch of thoughts just popping up like those annoying pop-ups, maybe that is why my blog jumps around a lot.  I don't know.  Anyway, that is all I wanted to blog about, popping off my frickin nails.  I better do well in bowling tomorrow...what do you guys think?
