It is a sad thing to think you have to go through things alone....but she always makes sure I don't walk through these problems alone.  She is always standing by me and reassuring me that I will get through all this and for some reason, when she says I can get through it, I start believing that I can.  I am so blessed with such wonderful people in my life.  I have to just remember that.  So the dookie is about to hit the fan...my cousin is about to receive word that my mom has filed official charges against him.  I am sad it has come to this, but we are in a very bad way and he won't communicate with us like adults.  I only hope that his family understands and sees where we are coming from....but that may be wishful thinking on my part.  Thanks to my personal cheerleader Heidi, I am in good spirits...a good friend can do that for you.   THANK YOU GOD FOR HEIDI!   Thanks to the many others who have kept me in their thoughts and in their prayers...I love you all.
