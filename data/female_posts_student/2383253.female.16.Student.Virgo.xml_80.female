Northwestern is so amazing. I'm having a terrific time and I'm learning a ton about journalism. It's so cool. Tomorrow we get to go to Newsweek and the Art Institue of Chicago! I'm so excited. Haha, and today we have our ONLY lecture on design... I'm turning into a...a... writer.   Oh, and I got my first (hopefully of many) articles published in the Daily Northwestern. It's about a giant penis (figures, right?). Check it out here: http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/vnews/ display.v/ART/2004/07/08/40ecdd057636e.   Good for you Insha, getting started on those apps! A lot of people here talk about college, so, yeah, that's on my mind too. And Heather, going out there and doing some visits- that's supachill. Hope you are feeling better. Wow you guys... this year is gonna be amazing.   E-mail me if you want, mfranks@san.rr.com.   I'm gonna go fold my laundry (a la more procrastination). Miss you all!
