It's a neat course, although it was completely lacking in structure, and I need structure real (rei) bad.  So I'm writing a paper where I have to illustrate how a particular piece of advertising is a cultural text.  I used a cosmetic ad from a women's mag.     It's supposed to be ironic: using the image of the atypical 50s housewife, holding a tray of baking, except it ain't cookies, and they ain't for you little rug-rats.  This is mommy make-up and it's just for mommies.  Wait a sec, I don't think this chick has ever had any kids.  In fact I don't think she's ever had any cookies.  But it's appropriate to the modern woman as defined in our culture, because it's funny.  Funny and true.  If it's not cleaning house and cooking meals to keep men happy, it's putting on slooty dresses and slathering on the make-up.  OK, that was a bit snipier than I meant it to be.  And that's why it was important to go see Mattee.  Yes, yes, I went over there to smoke pot, and yes, yes I did smoke pot, and yes, yes I'm rambling on and wasting blog space... But my good friend Mattee is going to be the best damn art director...as soon as he graduates.  And he's gonna go work for  urlLink Leo Burnett , or  urlLink J. Walter Thompson , or  urlLink BBDO , and be even more rich and famous than  urlLink Jerry Goodis  (yeah, for some reason, Mattee didn't know who that guy was when I dropped the name...hmm).  Anyway, Mattee had lots of very good constructive comments.  Not a whole lot of insight as to where I should take the paper, whether in another direction or deeper into the direction I've already embarked on...  But hopefully, I can get this done without too much pain.
