Its just fucking typical, and everyone loves Laura, blah blah, shes so great blah blah. Annoys me, and he ignored me? Twice? What is with that? Then i get a wave? I don't give a shit if he actually cares about her or not, he cheated on her one day in to the relationship with me, and he wanted to, end of, he doesn't care, he can't, hes a cheater and will always be a cheater. I'll never cheat on Lisa, those ways of mine are over, *cough* BOLLOCKS!*cough*   ~Lisa~
