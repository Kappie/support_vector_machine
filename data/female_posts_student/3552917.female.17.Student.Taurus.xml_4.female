Then Jamie and I called and said she was "stayin the night with me" and I said I was "staying the night with her" and then we well kinda went and met up with Justin and them and went up to Section to the little house. We didn't really do anything but hang out and stuff.. I didn't sleep all freakin night and then we left there about 9:30 this morning and took Lindsay home and Jamie and I came to my house and we laid on my bed and passed the fuck out.
