Given that I felt like I had been hit by a truck, I didn't make it to my ling. discussion.  I hate missing class, especially when it's a class that I'm fairly lost in.  Ah well.  This weekend promises to offer at least a little bit of a respite.  It's fall break, meaning there isn't class on Monday or Tuesday, although our prelim topics for the week do include the origins of agriculture, which means gobs and gobs of reading.  Of course, I took a whole class on that in undergrad, and did it again in two classes last year, so I should be okay.  I think.  I hope.    So, Columbus Day is Monday.  I don't really see why it's a national holiday.  I will instead jump on the Canadian bandwagon and celebrate Thanksgiving, instead.
