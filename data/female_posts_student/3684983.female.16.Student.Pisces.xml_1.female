Seeing couples on the street, i do feel happy for them, but somehow all around i am alone one self. I have envious before, jealous before and even cursed before, but the one that truly belongs to me still haven't appear. Or perhaps, he appears in front of me, it just that i have missed it... I don't know myself. I always thought i have love this guy whole-heartly but it the end, i found out that i actually never really loves a person before. I mean, i already hate myself that how could i possibly loves a guy, not to mention whole-heartly... Now i told myself, don't yearn too much of it, or you'll never get it... But somehow the more i don't care, the more i become heartless. I become more cold to the people i know... I told myself that, this is not my fault, its all my future love force me to. I know all these are excuses for me to carry on with myself. If i don't find excuses for myself, i doubt i can live until today... I am just stubborn in this way. It was because love turns out to be too scary for me. I fear it for i have been deeply hurt before in other ways. Frankly speaking, nobody will care how a person feels unless you care for that person. I doubt that there will be people who care to read at my blogs too... I don't expect too much in return, as long as i can find a way out of this reality world, and freely expressed all my agnoy and worries, i'm just fine with it... Love is a burden for human being but somehow people still yearn for it so much... Aren't we too lonely? I always do believe that there is more than in life. I doubt the thing is love. I do admit that it brings happiness to people but if it only works out to the people you love. Or else, hell shall it turn... People gives love many definitions but which one is true, which one is false?  PS: why do i think about it so much? when love comes, just fall in love and that's it...
