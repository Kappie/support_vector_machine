I'm seeing Less Than Jake and the Eary November tomorrow. I'm really excited to just go crazy. Plus I LOVE ACE! I had a little pow wow with Lizzie and Erica at Panera yesterday and we discussed how we are going to get ACE, ACE, ACE, ACE, ACE to love me tomorrow!   So this is the plan:  Need: 1. Get a milkshake 2. Find hot man after his show Action: 1. Slowly walk up to him with milkshake in hand 2. Break out into a rendition of "Milkshake":          a) "My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard"                      aa. Use hands to motion him towards you           b) "and they're like it's better than yours" 3. Start smearing the milkshake on his face while thrusting your body in very unflattering movements 4. Begin to lick the milkshake off his face 5. Being a new song:           a) "I wanna lick, lick, lick you from your head to your toes"                       aa. Begin to violently lick this strange man's face           b) "and I wanna know what, what, what's your fan-ta-sy!"  6. Strongly suggest moving this party to his clip-on truck thing where the doors will be locked and his pants will come off  7. Congratulations, you've found yourself a rock star  So I think that will work. Too bad I have gym tomorrow and then have to bolt over to the Newport. Oh well, it's going to be CRAZY. If you thought I was crazy by being apparently "stoned and drunk" on prom night, wait til you see me at a concert--it's like I'm hopped up on Opium, OxyContin, straight Vodka, intravenous drugs, and I have a bad case of herpes.   Today was okay. Senor found Shameem's blogs, therefore ALL ACCESS TO THE LAND OF CSG BLOGGING COMMUNITY. OUR ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE! WHAT WILL WE DO!? He's too wimpy to do anything, anyways. I helped Ms. King with a math problem today, she's so great! We're both worried about the test tomorrow. Tiarra baked me cookies and everybody was sweet again. Okay so yes, elections have come and gone, and it didn't go the way some (hem hem me) might have liked. Without boring you, I'd just like to say a few things that I learned yesterday: 1. Nothing is more important than the loyalty of your friends and family. I never knew how many people cared about me. People cried with me and told me how important I was and how much they loved me. I was never alone in the day, somebody was always with me taking care of me. I love everyone of my friends. My mom cried all day and so did her co-workers. You never think people care, but they really do, so don't forget it. 2. Even if you don't win something, never back down from what you believe in. I could have given the sugar cookie speech, it probably wouldn't have helped, but it could have, but don't do that. Stand behind what you believe in no matter what, you'll never regret staying true to yourself when it ends up the way you weren't hoping for.  3. Don't be afraid of failure. I always have been, but it taught me how amazing and lucky I am to have friends like I have. It was a sucky thing to make me realize that, but I learned something very important. So you might fail at the task at hand, but you will take away something much better.  4. Keep living and take care of those who helped you, they will really need you one day, so show them how much you love them. With that being said, thanks to all my unies who have supported me, I love you soo much! Liz, Eri, Anna, Ariel, Katie, ANN ELISE KELLEY (SWEETEST GIRL EVER!), Alana, Christina, my locker buddies Nikki and Kristen, Georgia, Chels... EVERYBODY I LOVE YOU GUYS SOOOOOOOO FREAKING MUCH!   So I must do some homework! Have a good night!
