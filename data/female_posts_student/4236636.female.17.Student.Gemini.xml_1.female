I didn't get any sleep last night, I don't know why, I think it might be cuz i drank so much tea that has caffine in it?? I went to bed at like 11pm but then woke up at 1am and couldn't go back to sleep till 5am and woke up at 9am. It's a weekend and I only got 6 hours of sleep... and not good sleep for that matter. Now I have to go play tennis in like 30 minutes and I'm really not up for it. Atleast I don't have vb today.   My sis is making pizza again, hopefully it turns out a little better then last time which might be a challenge since we don't have any sauce... GOD BLESS (you and our pizza)
