I got these capris and this cute shirt and some socks... socks?... yes, socks.... and just a few other little tidbits. I got this awesome like body powder that tastes like marshmellow and like 5 pairs of underwear in Aeropostale (thats spelled right, right?) which was cool. Gotta love good underwear deals.   Yeah... I'm mad excited about my trip out there. Ali told me she would be mad tired if it were her and I probably will be but I'll try get a 2nd wind... well by that time it might be a 3rd wind.  I'm just really worried about Debra. She needs to have surgery on her knee cause the stupid doctors had to wait till she had two tears in her ACL to realize something was wrong. I hate doctors. One says one thing, another says another thing, and then if you go to a third for a tie breaker you end up with zilch anyway.   School tomrrow... why?... because God hates us....  just kidding .   NEW SEASON OF SOUTH PARK TONIGHT! 9:30-10 YOU ALL BETTER WATCH!
