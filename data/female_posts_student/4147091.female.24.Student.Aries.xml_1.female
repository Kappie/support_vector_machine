I live in a sad world, but I love sports and anyone who dares to insult that can bite me.  So I leave in a week.  I'm getting use to the idea that I will soon be living in a city that values its beef and country music more than fish and Irish music.  I"m being teased by my friends that I will return in Dec with a thick, 'mainlander' accent.  I find this somewhat funny and amusing. When I was living in Cape Town, I lived with and made friends with many Canadians, all from Ottawa west.  But the whole linguistic divide became very apparent when a Canadian from Victoria moved in towards the end of my stay.  She had a very obvious, flat accent. Mutual friends of ours from Cape Town noticed very early on that we had different accents.  But none of our friends from South Africa had ever heard a 'newfie' accent before so I was not able to elicit from them whether they thought I sounded more 'east coast' than she did.  i personally don't think I sound like a newfie, especially when I've been away from home for any length of time.  but while in South Africa I was constantly asked if I was Irish (from my colouring and hair, but also from my accent).  Even when talking with my Canadian friends, people from South Africa would consider me Irish.  Ah well.  Similar things happened in Ireland, outside Dublin, the Irish thought I was from Dublin.  Inside Dublin, they knew I was from Ireland.  (I can't explain how happy it makes me when people actually know where Newfoundland is and can recognize it)
