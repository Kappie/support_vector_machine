It's not going to be too much fun...but hey, at the moment I really need God and I know it's not true but I feel like I lost him over the past month or so because of some dumb stuff that went on. When I come back, I'll find some time to write an entry on, first, what happened with Nick and why it's okay now, and then about camp. A GIGANTIC thank you to all of my friends who helped me this week...Tay, Allycia, JJ, Chris, Ben, Kurt (yes even you), Dani, Christa, Sarah, and Diana...just for diving into the fight just to make things better again. It worked. I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH, I didn't know I had so many friends until this week when you all helped me out...thanks for the prayers, the listening sessions, the advice, the hugs, EVERYTHING. Well, I'm off to camp, PEACE!!
