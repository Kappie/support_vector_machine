The people that are really special to you, you hold them close to you, so close like to the point where you get the opportunity to strangle them. People like this I love them to no end.  A "friend" of mine, well it is a very special human being.  It loves it'self; it doesn't care about anyone but it'self; you can tell it your problems but in a matter of 30 seconds, it returns the conversation back to being about it'self and nothing else; it thinks no one is better than it; it thinks it is full of problems and it wants to die, but instead continues to seek attention in telling lies about how it's life is so terrible; it doesn't listen to your advice it just rebuts it with saying it is scared; it has panic attacks over thinking about things; it refuses to take a look around and look deeper into anyone elses' life, just it'self. And concluding, it is very obsessive to a point where it becomes a disorder to the point where it needs rehabilitation. Oh and one last thing, it really thinks you care about what it has to say.   Truthfully said in my mind, I don't care about your emotional self-centerd problems, they only pertain to your own little self centerd self. You become emotionally attached to people who highly dislike you. You constantly tell people you cry all the time and that you need help BUT you don't listen to advice, don't let people help you. and can't take medication and your scared of hospitals, therefore your scared of help. (how can that be?- you should ask yourself sometime) You constantly say you have problems but you don't listen, therefore if you don't listen then people are either:  A) not going to help you.  B) won't even listen to you or  C) just ignore you like you don't even exist.   Choose wisely.  I know everyones starting to choose all the above. So you should: A) Blow up your self centerd world and look around B) Just sit there C) Keep complaining...  *sings* some of these answers, are just like the others...  Choose wisely again! :)        -amanda
