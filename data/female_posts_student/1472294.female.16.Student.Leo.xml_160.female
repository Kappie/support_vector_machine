Not interested in X-Men Evolution 2 today, coz something bad is going to happen in this episode. I also never watched Xiao Qian yesterday night. Too tired even though I drank coffee, muz be the cause of tution, espescially chem tution. Mybe watching Kim Possible at noon after that. Want to watch Fabric Of the Nation on Channel News Asia but the speech so long, will watch the news on Channel 8 tonight. Haiz... my block downstairs is building a stage and it is so noisy and afterwards, there will be annoying kids jumping on the stage *BOOM BOOM* My RC sucks. Will also be checking the music store later to see how the S.H.E album looks like....
