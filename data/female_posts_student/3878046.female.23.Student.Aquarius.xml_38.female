	 
      shattered teardrops
beyond repair
sting my eyes
like razor sharp needles
a million teardrops 
fill a chasm of despair

a broken reflection 
of a broken self
splintered glass
razor edges
that cut my life
to painful shreds

shattered teardrops
crystal shards
prick my skin
like crimson velvet
rivers of blood
the emptyness within
