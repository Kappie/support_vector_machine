Mom tells me that Kristine might be going to Mac and I was like, "Damn, now I can't go to Mac!!" What in the hell is wrong with me? I mean I just be happy that somebody I know is going to Mac! And guess what, Brenda's going too. I don't like that girl. She's a tad eccentric. She's only going there for Arts. Pfft, I ain't gonna call her stupid but she is good at music.   Why oh why has the St George acceptance not come yet? I heard that if you get accepted to the Scarborough Campus, you won't get accepted to the St George campus? I really hope that isn't true. Still, I don't know anyone who applied to both but me, well except for Joseph. He got into both though. Hmmm.
