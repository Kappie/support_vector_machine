Really sad, i know...im actually really depressed...i wish that i could be back at summer school with all my friends...i really miss them all. I mean it would be nice to get in a get together again..im listening to Faith Hill, "Breathe" Exciting stuff huh? I love Davis and all, but it has NOTHING on San Francisco...i wish i were in San Francisco. I love San Francisco, its all i have. Its the only thing that i know that i can hold onto it. And then ofcourse some damn terrorists will come and blow it all up. I have to go...i dont really want to write right now...im probably gonna go finsish a layout i started and never finished. Okay then...and then code dolls again...i miss all my friends so much! I want jo and kristin back and zack and jennifer...i dunno.
