Here are the rules. I left her a comment. Anyone who wants to participate and has a blog or journal, leave me a comment, preferably with an email address. Although I understand if I'm too freaky and you just want me to comment on YOURS..... *sigh*   1 - Leave a comment, saying you want to be interviewed. 2 - I will respond; I'll ask you five questions. 3 - You'll update your journal with my five questions, and your five answers. 4 - You'll include this explanation. 5 - You'll ask other people five questions when they want to be interviewed.      1.  What is the funniest book you've ever read?   Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal SNogging,  et al. To commit the reductive fallacy, they are "teen" novels about a weird English girl. Sooooo addictive, and I laugh out loud while reading. I suggest them to anyone, because they're too good to be "tenn books"..... they're even funnier for the culture shock.     2.  Where in the world would you most like to visit?  WIlliamsburg, VA, right now. I want to go to college there but my parents don't like that idea, so I may never get to go.....    3.  Who is your favorite non-Simpson resident of Springfield?  Milhouse. The show would have no emotional drive without him. "I swear, I don't know how that scrunchie got in my hair!" ....... "I wish I was a free man. .,.... Oh, no! Puppy Goo-goo! MOM! Where's Puppy Goo-goo?" *recieves toy, cuddles* "Oh, Puppy Goo-goo, fetch me a dream!"   4.  What music do you play when you are feeling happy and/or optimistic?  Sheryl Crow,  C'mon, C'mon  album. "Soak up the Sun"...... Need I say more?   Actaully, this one is versatile. It expresses so many feelings, but always with this overtone of hope. I listen to it when I'm in a good mood, but also when I want to be in one......FYI, it's also great music for packing and unpacking suitcases.....    5.  What made you decide to study German?  FATE. or an accident, if you prefer...... I can't roll my R's, and I really hate the sound of Spanish, and my middle school had the choice of Spanish or German. I chose German, unlike all my friends. But it has been so worth it. I mean, I'll have done six years of it before college, because it just rocks. I love it and I thank god I didn't take anything else! I need to blog in German sometime.    5a.  Optional bonus question:  Have you ever seen the Wim Wenders movie Wings of Desire?  No, but now I think I'll have to. Does it involve German?   NOW GO COMMENT!
