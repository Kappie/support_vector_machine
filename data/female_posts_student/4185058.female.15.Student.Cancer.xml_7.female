I just started this, i don't no why its another question added to the unanswered, watch me not blog here very much...even tho i wont have much else to do since Niki left me for like all of August and Lauren does camp EVERY day lol. And Then theres Sam, who got pissed at me this morning I don't exactly understand why but lets hope it all blows over! I have more friends than that lol but its summer and people go away and you don't really keep in touch with the people you do during school. Well shall we hear about my boring day...i guess so since thats what this page is suppose to be for isn't it? Well Got up around 10:30 Yay! lol and went and fed neighbours cat and fish and watered there plants like i've been doing since Friday...my first time house sitting how exciting lol, then i pretty much sat around, finished reading my book called One Hot Second (a serious of stories) it was kinda weird but meh i like reading, and while i was reading i listened to my brothers fight outside...did they no they were outside where people could see them try and kill eachother? lol i hate brother,anyways i went on computar for a while no one was on, went outside to tan but the sun disappeared...and as i look out the window at the moment i see that it has returned, decdied to bike down to library got a few more books, went to zhers on the way home to see if my pics were in yet(i'm so excited i have ones from rugby then me and my cuz on it) but of course 3 days isn't long enough for them to develop 2 films for me! lol like i'm the only one who brough in films...if only. And yea that would be my day boring huh? I have a life...not a big one but still one that i do get out! but liek i said its summer and people are on vacation! Oh yea nad thats not all my sis came home from drivers training and had to call zhers, but the guy left 2 different numbers so she decided to yell at ME sheesh but yea she finally got a hold of them they wanted to see if she would like to work there...turns out they work between 3-5 hours a week...what the hell is that?! I work 20 hours a week and at my sis's other job she works 40 hours a week i don't tihnk she needs 5 hours a week, i hate jobs. lol Well that was fun now wasn't it? lol maybe i will return another time and let you no more of my boring life! yay lol
