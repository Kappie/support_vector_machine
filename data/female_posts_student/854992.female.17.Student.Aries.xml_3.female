I felt numb and faint as I stumbled blindly over to my bed, reaching under the massive block, pulling out the tattered box of heartache. Opening it to remind myself of the pain I've been through, the hell, the heartbreak.   I need to remind myself of all that is horrible in love. I need to wash you off of me. Your scent lingers in my mind, my bed, my life. Your voice echos in my ears, in the empty membrane of my mind, your smile hovers in every empty picture frame. Yes, I need to wash you out of my life once again.   I sigh and push the box back under my bed.
