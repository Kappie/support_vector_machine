Hey, sorry for so few posts lately. I really do still have a couple of good ideas rattling around somewhere in my head. However, they've been superseded by the following announcement:  

   I CAN HAVE KITTENS 
IN OUR NEW 
APARTMENT!!!!!!!!!     

In case you missed that, let me just repeat:  

    I CAN HAVE KITTENS 
IN OUR NEW 
APARTMENT!!!!!!!!!      

Whoo! And I've found the kittens I want to bring home. They're currently at a rescue shelter called  urlLink The Itty Bitty Orphan Kitty Rescue Shelter . Ok, first of all, how can you resist a shelter named something like that?? Seriously! So, here we go, the first introduction:   

Meet  urlLink Reilly   

        

And  urlLink Gwynith   
       

How could you possibly resist these two??? I mean, really? So, I'm still going through the interview process, where they decide whether or not I'm a suitable candidate. I submitted the written application today and was invited to come meet Gwynnie and Reilly, so I think I've passed the first test. Think good thoughts in my direction and, while it may be a silly thing to pray about, I'm also asking for prayers. I don't know why, but of all the kittens I looked at through  urlLink Petfinder , these two just tugged at my heart strings. I think, silly as it may sound, that I would be heart-broken if I couldn't bring these two home. Don't get me wrong, I would still go look for another kitten or kittens, but... I'd be very disappointed initially.   

So, obviously, I have kittens on the brain and very little else. I'll tell you what, though, those two cuties have given me more motivation to finish packing up my house than anyone or anything else has! So, I'll be disconnected starting either tomorrow or the day after until we get moved. Not so much because the connection will be shut down but simply because I need to pack my computer and quit collecting junk over here. So... I'll be back. Promise. Just may take a week or two. And then, prepared to be flooded with posts about kittens.
