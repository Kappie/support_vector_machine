Friday night was a nice night at home relaxing after a very exciting rugby game and then Saturday I hung out went to drivers came home and did papers then I went to Ashley's place we hung out there with Amber, Travis, Justin, Bunny, and I.  It was super fun we played with the kitties we jumped on the trampoline that was fun! We even named the kitties! The fuzzy one is Lily the one with its eyes close together is Shania and the Black one is Electrode? I think and it means Amber lol! I wanted one so bad but my mom wont let us get one even if I take care of it and pay for everything I want Lily or Shania I love the color of them! My famiky just doesn't like cats I guess THING TO REMEMBER!!!!  Never ask Amber if she is in gymnastics when she is jumping because then she falls through the springs! lol!  We watched   Texas Chainsaw massacre  . What a movie! lol it was good but very scary its not something you can watch more then once because then you know everything that's going to happen.  I kept trying to tell myself that the movie wasn't real I was so fucking scared but then its based on a true story that has never been solved so it wasn't working that well! Ash and I found out 10:30 on sat how good Pina - Coloda smells! It smells like coconut and EVERYTHING that smells like coconut smells so good! And tastes so good well not really but I don't know lol! Anyways! Then Ash and I stayed up way to late and slept till 12 and we had to eat and shower and get ready SUPER fast! lol.  It was a night to remember! Then we picked up my little sister for the Rider game and she brought a friend HER FIRST GAME AND THE RIDERS WON!!! lol it wasn't that great of a game but it was still fun! I saw Mike Switika(??) there and we were looking for Jason Weist but couldn't find him but then I later found out that he was sitting 4 rows infront of us LAUGHING because we couldn't see him! That made me mad when I found out I really wanted to see him but hey Jason and Mike are both coming to choir concert on Wed! It's very exciting! I cant wait to give Mike his present but I lost a piece of it so I have to go buy another one on Tuesday or Monday. Oh! That Reminds me Rhiannon do you think you could brign that picture soon please?!?! I really really need it I want them to see it on Wed!;) I don't want to go back to school tomorrow! I think I might go to bed early today? hmm...I don't know I want to look refreshed tomorrow because we have to sing in front of the school once again for a freakin mass which I am okay with I just don't like to sing in front of our school its kind of weird! lol But meh I might read a lot tonight that will be exciting.
