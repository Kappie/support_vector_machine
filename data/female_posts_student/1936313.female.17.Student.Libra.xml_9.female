For those of you who don't know what the River Styx is... its from Greek Mythology... the river which souls of the dead were ferried across into Hades... fun hey? Is exactly where I feel I am.. standing on the banks of the River Styx and debating jumping in.   New Artist Update... High Holy Days... these guys rock.. anyone remember my days as the die-hard Creed fan? Thats probably why I like them so much, their music has that hard to find.. i dunno.. sound I guess... Creed had it.. in their bass and guitar... I can't quite explain it, but take a listen or something.  High Holy Days - Website  Their alblum doesn't come out until the end of March but theres some sample music on that website.. cool stuff...  I'm going to jump into the river...    - - Treachery like I..I have never seen, so never mind your sorrows, your demons live for me. What are we doing in this place again? You know you've got the answer boy, your lying to yourself.. and I found you at the River of Styx all alone...- -
