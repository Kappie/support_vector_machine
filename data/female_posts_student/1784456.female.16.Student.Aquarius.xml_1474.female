It's just hard to tell when to leave people alone, when they go off sulking, say that they're alright and to not worry you stay with them of course! But then some people get angry because they actually meant it. Hmm... I'm in a random mood I guess. Yeayyy! Cheese cake and salmon sandwhiches! *Mmm salmon* I actually like salmon now, all that force feading actually worked! (But it still smells, hah! They'll never convince me otherwise!) Ahh I've got one million and three things to do, but I really can't be bothered to do them! (It's always like that with me) Damn homework...
