Especially Track No.9   which is one of the themesongs in The Family Man series. A very good song.   Yesterday night, I had watched the last episode of Hard Fate. Luckily, there is a happy ending, though it can be a lot happier if Ceci did not die. Definitely not one of my favourite shows. Current favourite is The Family Man.  Three more days to Flora's birthday which is on May 30th. I wonder how she will be spending it. Any idea?
