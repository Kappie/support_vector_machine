For those single and/or undersexed girls or merely those looking for a little change, I introduce to you.  THE TALKING VIBRATOR, VIBEY 3000: Pre-Programmed to Love and Pleasure You All Night Long (or until the batteries wear out).  I know that there are vibrators on the market in which you can record your own messages, but my idea consists of pre-recorded messages designed to fit your particular sexual mood.  There is:   Vibey the Romantic : Let Vibey's deep, soothing, and sensual voice make sweet, sweet love to you as you reach the heights of pleasure.  Feeling a little kinky? Let  Vibey the Freak  talk dirty to you with your choice of 1) dirty 2) Naaaasty or 3) Downright perverted!  This vibrator would also feature optional fetish talk customized to fulfill yourdeepest, darkestfetish.  For single girls, get all the satisfaction of being with a man without the hassle and arguments. No need to wonder if the Vibey 3000 (pending a better name) really likes you, cause he tells it like it is, bitch!  In a relationship and but wonder what it would be like with another man? Well, the Vibey 3000 allows to you simulate the feeling of a secret lover without any of the guilt and lies.  What ever your sexual needs may be, the Vibey 3000 satisfies all of them. Just ask our distributor and satisfied customer, Ron Popeil!
