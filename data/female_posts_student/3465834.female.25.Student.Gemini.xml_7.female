I am as usual procrastonating on an assignment and have come to the realisation, I'm just not going to make it in the real world.  I have no respect for time management and no adhearance to deadlines.  Today is Fathers Day, and tomorrow is the first day of summer, my Dad is at the cottage and its 14 degrees out, what does that tell you?  Nothing?  Do they have a kids day?  Probably...  Ok this is probably my worst blog ever, I have nothing of importance to talk about and from the looks of it so far, nothing is even coherent.  Clearly this is just procrastonation, and I can't even do that right.  Better get back at it!
