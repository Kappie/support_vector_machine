We didnt really do much in the morning!  We ate breakfast and then we started to watch A Clockwork Orange, (( never finished it ))!  Then my mom daddy told me that Amanda could come to the BBQ with me so it made me happy because none of my cousins like me because they are all weirdos!  Really they are!  Ok, Jeremiah and Kaleb have both been in love with me!  And it's sick because yeah, they are my cousins ... Maybe not real cousins, but step-cousins is close enough! At the BBQ we umm ... ate and tried to tan, but it didn't work because there wasn't enough sun!  Amanda said that you tan more in the clouds, I don't understand how that would work, but I believe her!  I played with Olivia (( my 2 year old cousin )) and it was fun!  She spilt ice cream all over her little baby foot and to be a dork I licked it all off and she laughed at it made me so happy because I love when little kids laugh!  It is so cute!  Then me and Amanda sat around and ... did nothing!  She flossed my toes because she is a dork, so I did hers too!  ... Don't ask!  Then I called Lori and she told me to come over!  Yay!  I love Lori! My grandpa drove me, Mark, and Amanda back to my house and made sure that my car started (( I wasn't able to drive last night because it said service engine, but my grandpa said it was ok to drive because he is bringing it in to get it fixed again tomorrow )) and then we all drove over there!  While I was driving there I saw Steve leaving and I was like Oh, that's sad because I love Steve and I want him to stay!  When I got there her dad ordered pizza, and it was sad because I had already eaten so much food!  But, I ate more because I'm love with food ... it makes me happy!  Then Lani came and she brough Lord of the Rings and we watched it!  I don't really like those movies, but thats ok!  I watched it anyways!  Then yeah ... I don't know!  I told Bob that I loved him and instead of saying I love you back he kept saying "Olive Juice!"  That is so 3rd Grade, words of Amanda!    Now I'm at home and I have nothing to do!  I showered, because I haven't showered since Saturday afternoon!  EEWW!  Actually, I don't care because I don't have anyone to impress!  Mmmm, I need to find someone to impress!  Becaus I'm not good enough the way I am now, and I want to be loved by someone, and I want a boyfriend!  Ohh, how sad!   Ok, so I am officially stopping with all the bullshit!  I want to make peace with everyone!  And I figure that the only way I can do that is if I start fresh with myself!  I need a personality makeover!  I'm really stopping with the drugs, I don't want them anymore!  Even if they are around me I am going to say no!  And smoking, I'm not gonna do that anymore!  I never really was a smoker, I just did it on occasion ... but now I'm stopping for good!  And I'm not going to drink because I really don't like the way it tastes!  It makes me tummy feel sick!  Umm ... I'm not going to lie anymore because lying only leads to problems!  It makes you lose friends and that is never a good thing, because I love all of my friends, OLD and NEW ... even the ones that don't consider me a friend anymore.  I'm not going to cheat anymore, on anything!  At games, on people, on homework ... it is stupid because I don't want to be cheated and I shouldn't do to others what I don't want to be done to me!  Yeah, that makes sense, right?  Hmmm ... I know there is something else!  ... Oh yeah, no more liking my friends family memebers!  That means Ashleigh, I'm not going to like Kyle anymore!  Lori, I'm not going to like Steve anymore!  Amanda, I'm not going to have a crush on your cousin, if I ever do meet him!  Hmmm, I know there is some other ones, I just can't think of it right now!  I'm not just saying this all for the heck of it!  I really do want to change because I want to be a better person!  I've been feeling really ... depressed lately!  And I couldn't think of why this could be!  I mean I have my best friends, Lori and Amanda!  And I have my family, that I'm finally starting to get along with!  And ... I don't know ... I should be happy!  And I'm not!  I miss people ... and I really shouldn't miss them because they have been really shitty to me in the past week or so!  But I guess I haven't been the best to them either!  Oh, but I want to change!  Nobody believes me, but I'm serious!  I don't think I've ever been so serious about something in my life!  Ahh, ok ... I'm done!
