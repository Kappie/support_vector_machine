Mom had to go to the store and seeing as i can't drive i decided to go with her and then go get shannon. Shannon came over around noon. We ate a pizza and watched Head of State. After eating and watching the movie we decided to swim. So we swam for a long time and then laid out in the sun. I think we got a little burnt. We then came in and i took my shower while she talked on the internet. We had to be at a basketball game at 6 and Shannon finally got off of the internet at like 5:15. We ended up being late. Only to be shot down by Niki because my friend from Lousiana is in town and she didn't like her style. O well. My grandma was going to pick us up but she was late. So we just sat outside. Shannon's boyfriend even left us sitting outside the gym. When grandma came we were hungry and wanted to go harass Shannon's brother at work so we went to were he works, but he had the night off. We then went to Wendy's and ended up eating in the car. Fun. We took Shannon home and now I am here writing in my blog. How much fun.
