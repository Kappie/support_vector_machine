People who have made me feel better: -Heather -Liz -Kailey -Andrew -Emily (on the good days) -My cat -Julie ...more people im forgetting...   if youre not on the list, dont worry...it doesnt mean you put me in a bad mood or anything.  eh, i have to go continue cleaning my room and then go to blockbuster...  heres to eric keeping his hands to himself tonight! i wonder if i even want to know? sigh... it would be just perfect if it happened during this period of time when i feel like i dont know her very well too. just perfect. gar. stupid life.  anyway, cleaning and then blockbuster and then grocery store.  i wonder if liz will get my directions?  id put my pizza tiger on here, but its not possible if its not hosted by some site or something. it was a nice picture though. which reminds me... i have to send jenna and dana and erin and olga and jessica those pictures... hmm....gotta get to that.  i wonder what my parents would say if-- ha, i dont even want to think about that... too crazy and too improbable and too far in the future.  you know what i was thinking about this morning? im such a crazy hopeless/helpless (which one is it?) romantic. urlLink      urlLink Quiz By Lady Paje    urlLink
