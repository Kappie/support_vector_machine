I ordered that new Bacon Mushroom melt thingy... it was ok, I thought it was going to be better. Before that we went to the gym. I used the treadmill for 20 minutes and I did 1.25 miles. I REALLY need get into in shape. My legs are really killing. My brother just gave me a cup of his protein shake. It's not that bad. It's peanut butter and berries. It tastes like a liquid for of PB and J. Well... tonight's entry was short. *shrugs* oh well. =)
