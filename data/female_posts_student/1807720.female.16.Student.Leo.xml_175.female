Ok so like I think I am sick, my mom cracker her tooth down the middle, and now today me Dad flew in yesterday and was helping Ben with the house and he fell and broke his ankle.  Ok so yeah that wouldn't be that bad on "NORMAL" circumstances, but my sisters wedding is this upcoming Saturday.  So yeah my Dad will have to like hobble down the aisle instead of walk my sister down it.  He is more of a pain in the ass that sits and watches T.V. now - certainly not much of a help.  I am also really proud of myself right now.  I studied so much for my Bio, I did all the concept questions as I went through each chapter and I have read them more than once.  I plan to read them again maybe later tonight, but I really feel like I know the info so well.  I always study, but I have never felt this way before.  I feel as though I could be ready to write it tomorrow and you know what I probably am.  However, I will use the one day extra to my advantage.  I might as well, more review.  I mean no matter what I score on this test, I really know I put my 150% into it.  That is all I can do.  I know what I want, I know where I want to go, and I know what I need to do to get there.  So bring on the Bio, yeah cause I can handle it!  OH and here are some pictures from the play:
