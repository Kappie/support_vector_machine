I’m using Seth’s li’l laptop right now, this little devil has brought happiness to both me and Seth, he gets his own computer and I don’t have to stay up till the wee hours of the morning to talk to people if I don’t want to! *wink* On Vagrant tonight I read a thread about racism, it really made me want to pull my hair out. I don’t know what to say about it...its so vast...yet so stupid and small.  Wow, laughs, I sound like a genius tonight.  Oh so deep! *rolls eyes* I can’t do anything tonight, because I have to watch the kids, but I have got an itch for doing something exciting, like going dancing, I know I just posted something along these lines a couple of hours ago (loser radar sounding) but now its just turned into wanting some reason to dust off the curling iron and pull out some pumps.  You know, have something to look ‘foxy’ for...LAUGHS!  Foxy indeed....
