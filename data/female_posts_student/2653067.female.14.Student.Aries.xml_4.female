Well, the aforementioned is bleeding because curiosity got the best of her and she cut her thumb with an X-acto knife that she got a hold of.  I'd expect this sort of behaviour of a younger kid.  I can feel for her though, because the same thing happened to me.  Except I was like four, not almost fourteen years old.  When I was four, I was at my dad's store for the day.  A shoe store can be p-r-e-t-t-y boring for a four year-old.  So what do I do?  I find an X-acto knife lying around on the counter and cut my thumb with it, just to make sure it's sharp and in working order;-)  Man did it bleed!  So I can relate to how freaked out Julie is feeling at the moment.  It bled and it bled and it bled.  It bled so much that I thought I was going to bleed to death.  Hey, I was four.  Thankfully my Dad jumped in to my rescue just as I jumped in to Julie's rescue.  I guess being qualified to save lives does pay off once in a while.  I'm sure Julie will be here shortly to fill this blog up with many posts of her own. So until next time,  urlLink Vanessa   Edit: I failed to mention this earlier, usually when someone starts a blog they're like "WTF do I write for my very first blog entry?!?" and then the introduce themselves or something.  I just wanted to point out that Julie has a perfect 1st post in my eyes because it says something about her, and it's not her that's writing her  Historic 1st Post , it is I that is writing it as she is incapacitated (and because in order to publish this blog on the 'net it needs to have a 1st post.)  Once again I just thought that I'd point that out.  Now pay homage to the literary genius that I am and show me (well...my sister) some love in the form of comments.  Yes.  I have no shame.
