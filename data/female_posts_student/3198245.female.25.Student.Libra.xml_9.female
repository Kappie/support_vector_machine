It's gonna be fun and exciting! Lucky for the next batch they have people like us. Well, we'll get first shot at the hotties and the cuties so that's incentive enough. I hope we go down in history as the best party class ever... I think we're doing a good job living that reputation already.   Can't wait for next year and start partying again!!! Oh, and study, of course.
