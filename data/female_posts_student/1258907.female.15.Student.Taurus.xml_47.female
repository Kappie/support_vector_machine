I thought it was obvious But again, I am wrong I thought it was obvious That I just dont belong  Can you tell that I am scared? Can you tell that Im unprepared? Can you tell that I am weak? Can you tell that Im a freak?  It must be obvious That Its not meant to be It must be obvious By the falling debris It must be obvious I cannot see It must be obvious You cant disagree
