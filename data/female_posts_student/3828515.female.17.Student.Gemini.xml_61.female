We didn't stay there for very long; we just walked through the gardens for a little while and left. We then went to Gino's East for pizza and brought some home for David. Tonight was exciting :P. I played some intense ping pong with my brother and then we washed my mom's and dad's cars, which I really didn't understand because the point was indeed to wash mine, and we never ended up getting to it... Hmm... Anyways. As I am typing I am still a little wet from doing that. And that is all, my friends.      Last song I listened to:   Damage, Inc.  by Metallica.   Last album I listened to:   Some Kind Of Monster .   Last meal I ate:  Deep dish pizza.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .
