When I found out I started hyperventilatingandIfelt like I was going to faint. I tried typing the news to Henna, but my fingers wouldn't work. An overreaction maybe, but still: OH MY GOD! So happy. Really. And interestingly, the prince referred to in the title is neither You Know Who nor Harry. Can't wait to learn more, 'cause I'm a Spoiler Whore. Hee.   In other news... My cousinTasia is becoming a teen, which equaled a lot of ranting to Henna on my part; my brother just decided to spill about 200 Disney Charades cards on my bedroom floor; Henna has her own  urlLink blog  now; Natalia's left us for piano camp (which will mean lots of "One time, at piano camp..." stories); I spent the night with Henna's extended family in Boston on Friday (don't ask); until today one of the windows in my room was missing, causing me to find six new mosquito bites on my arms nightly. Pray that I don't get malaria.   Unless you hate me, in which case I'm fully okay with you praying that I get it.   Currently Watching:  Monty Python and the Holy Grail ,  Gilmore Girls: Season 1: Disc 1, Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock: The Animated Version .
