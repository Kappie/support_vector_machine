ALL day! lol. haha we didnt even stop 2 eat. lol we got a lot of it done tho. so now im just sittin here waitin 4 tony 2 come on, and tiffany is workin on the puzzle. again! lol. o, i got my schedule! i had thought i hadnt gotten it, but really i had and my aunt had already opened it and evrything and had it in her stuff. couldnt bother 2 tell me about it lol. i even asked her about it! but yea, i think im the only one out of all the ppl i know who's happy w/ their schedule. xcept i didnt get SAT prep. but at least i got my alternate. every1 else's is just totally screwed up lol. well im gonna go help tiffany w/ the puzzle till tony comes on.
