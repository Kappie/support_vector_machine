I spent the hour between 7 and 8 this morning hauling garbage cans of outdated files to the dumpster that is 30 yards from the back door of our office.  Said dumpster has not been emptied in at least a week, and the weather here has been alternately wet and extremely hot, conditions that are sufficient to bring things in the dumpster to frankenstein-like life.    Needless to say, even at 7am, I sweated enough to render my makeup useless, and to add insult to injury, my valiant efforts to organize the files here gave me a blister on my soft little hand.  And somehow, I've noticed a pattern as to the height of my heels in relation to the amount of manual labor I do that day.  The taller my heels, the more crap I have to move around.  At one point, I moved about 2000 lbs. of documents from one room to another while wearing 3" heels.  I looked very fashionable, but my back was killing me.  Today, I'm down to about a little over a 2" heel, and I'm estimating that I trucked 300 lbs. about 100 feet.    All of this to say, "cushy" office jobs, as it has been implied on  urlLink others' blogs , are not as cushy as they seem.
