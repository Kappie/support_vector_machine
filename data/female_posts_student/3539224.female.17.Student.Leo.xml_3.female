Prom was a night I will never forget, my date was a total gentleman who showed me all of his attention, I really appreciated that. I'm glad I went with my good friend, well at the time he was a good friend to me, but I guess sometimes people just drift apart even though you don't want it to happen it does. If there was anything I could say to him it would be that I was glad to be his friend even if it had to come to end (it was over stupid shit). My dress was absolutely beautiful, well I'll describe it to you, it was very poofy and white, it had purple and silver beads down the front.      Now I'll tell you about prom day. I got up at 8 to start getting ready, I showered. After I was done my mom did my hair around 10ish since my brother had a baseball game at 1. My mom and I made a last minute trip to walmart to pick up some last minute items from prom, then we headed over to the ball fields to watch my brother's team kick some ass (they are coached by my dad). My friend Stephanie was dropping off her brother and saw me with my hair done, she commented and said she liked it. After my brothers game was over we headed home to put some last minute touches to my hair. I got a call from my date saying he was coming over at 4 to get pictures. Well I then put my dress on and did my make up and all the other girlie things you have to do to be ready for a big day like this. Bryan (my date) showed up in his moms car which we took to prom and his mom was following him in Bryans truck. We took tons of pictures, then hung out for a bit at my house. We left my house and went to Bryan's to pick up something he forgot. After that we headed off to the Grand March, that wasn't too bad!!. After the Grand March we went to the country club and stood in line for pictures, and we did that then had dinner. Prom was over all the best night of my life, the most memorable moment was singing Hey Mickey to Mr. Blatnik!.       ...Cant wait till prom next year!!!...
