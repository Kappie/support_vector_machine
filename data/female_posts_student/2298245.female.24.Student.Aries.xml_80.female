       
      Exam #2, the dreaded Tax exam, will be starting soon.  Working on my last minute magic, just hoping at the point that I FINISH the exam.  I'm really worried about it, almost as worried as I was before my first law school exam ever.  I almost got sick this morning I was so nervous.  And the pressure is only going to continue to build over the next couple of hours.  So if I survive, I'll see you on the other side.
