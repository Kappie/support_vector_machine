Kind of like a HE SAID .. HE SAID (actually Point/Counterpoint sounds better).  I'm such a hick!  LOL!  I'm welcoming all sorts of contributors from all walks of life because I didn't want something homegeneous.  I like diversity.  Anyway, if Net will give me his ABOUT HIM descriptive article I can load his tech post.  I've got some cartoons that Brian is contributing but I'm waiting for his BIO NARRATIVE too.  I'm working on mine and I can't wait to get it done so I start posting my own stuff.  What did you think of the layout, though?  It's really simple but it works for me.  We can work on beautification later I guess.   I'm content with having a functional site for now.
