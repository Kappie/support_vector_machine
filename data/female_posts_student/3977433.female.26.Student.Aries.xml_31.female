I'm getting drunk tonight. Some people are coming over. We're going to swim and listen to music. (can i make it sound any more exciting? (sarcasm)) I'm sure it will be fun. But I'm very worried about 2 people right now. It's weighing heavily on my mind.       I'm going to nap so I acutally have some energy before anyone shows up.       I smell like bread and grass. Anyone wanna hump?      Have a good day.
