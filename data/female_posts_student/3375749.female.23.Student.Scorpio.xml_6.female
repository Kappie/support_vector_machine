I've been in college, on and off now, for about 4 years. I still have no clue what I want to do. I wasn't one of those kids who ate the age of 12 was able to tell everyone, "I want to be a fireman/doctor/bus driver when I grow up." My head has always been in the clouds too which sometimes makes things worse. For instance if someone asked me today what would I be if I could be anything in the whole wide world I'd say the next lead singer in the Dixie Chicks band. That's right. But let's face it, I'm 23 and not getting any younger, I don't happen to live in Nashville, and I'm not the best singer in the world. (Shocking, but true.) So this leaves me where? I once thought I wanted to be a elem. school teacher. Then I started taking classes and volunteering and found out what it was all about. No thanks. Did you know that if a kid shows signs of suicide and actually commits suicide, they can blame it on a teacher for not seeing the signs? Stupid, stupid, stupid. Parents are ruining the whole teaching thing. They blame everything on the school system. So I x-ed that career. My friend Megan just graduated from USF and has moved to Syracuse, NY to get an advertising job. My other friend Kelly graduated from UF and has since went on to graduate school in Boston for criminal justice. Kristy became a nurse. Andrea works for an eye doctor. Jill's one year away from being a dental hygienist. Claire's graduated and can now get a job as a high school physics teacher. Leslie has a graphic art design degree....Must I go on? And what am I doing? Working part time at a golf course still twiddling my thumbs saying, "What do I want to be?" (Sigh) Jeff's mom told me I should get into real estate. It's only a 2 week course and then you take a test. I think I'll take the classes through the community college. At least then I'll have a real job. Maybe I can take night classes too once I get into real estate. Maybe by then I'll have figured out what I want to be.
