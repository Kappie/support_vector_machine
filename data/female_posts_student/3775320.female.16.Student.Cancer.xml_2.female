It's not a creative work, but I guess it does come from inside me, so I'm putting it here instead of on my blog where I just write my feelings. This dream made me really think. It also made me really scared. Here it is:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   There was a nasty old woman who wanted money from us.  I think she was the landowner of our old house on Waterloo Road Hill, Man Fuk Road.  She was being really mean since we didn't actually owe her money at all, so my dad said he was going to go over and reason with her. I don't know why, but I went with him.  We went down the elevator, and it seemed to take a long time going down.  Didn't we live on the 6th floor?  Anyway, when it reached around the fifth floor [why did it take so long?], it started plunging, and I instantly knew that this was my end. I just remained sort of calm and resolute as it went crashing down.  When it hit the bottom, it exploded.  I felt the heat, and the pressure, and the wave of energy.  I could feel the fire all over me, but before it started to hurt and blister, everthing faded to black and sort of froze.  This low voice said simply: "You are going, to hell."  My mind felt like it exploded then, but I was in complete darkness. There was nothing there.  I wasn't sitting on anything, but I didn't seem to be falling.  Or maybe I was, but I couldn't feel it, since there was no air resistance or wind or anything.  I felt scared, disappointed, ashamed, lost, a bit angry, hopeless, empty, but most of all, lonely.  And they all felt more intense than anything I've felt before.  It was millions of times worse than total despair. There was nothing but me.  I hugged myself, but that didn't comfort me. It just reminded me that the only person there to hug me was me. I was so sad I didn't even cry. I felt so bad it should've killed me, except I was already dead, and then I woke up.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------  I'm so confused I don't know how to say it. I wrote an email to a friend though, and this is what I wrote:   "When I woke up, I could feel my skin tingling from the 'explosion'. or maybe the fear. I can't remember the tons of things my mind raced through about why I'd gone to hell, but there was an awfully long list. And the thing that stood out the most was that I'd always doubted in the back of my head whether I was saved. They say when you accept Jesus as your Savior then...etc. I accept it, but I don't know if I really accept it deep down, in the 'actually happened' way, or if it's just a sort of 'oh ok' thing. And I don't feel very saved. But then I've never doubted that God does exist.  I feel like I'm so sure and unsure at the same time. And I don't really know what I think. I try to harness my thoughts but they keep contradicting each other, so I don't know if this is making sense. And it might not even be what I'm trying to say, because this morning after I calmed down and after the sun rose [the sun makes everything better], I tried writing anything down, but I couldn't really make sense.  After I think it, it's gone, and I can't even remember what I thought. The more I try to remember, the more confused I feel.  So, this email has gotten rather depressing. I'm still feeling bad whenever I think of it, but when I manage to forget then it's like it never happened. I know this dream has significance. I'm not a good Christian.  Am I even a Christian when I doubt so much? Do I actually doubt it? I do accept it all. I know it's not fake, but it doesn't seem like I think it's real either.  What do I think? Well, I still feel really messed up inside, but I don't want to swarm you with too much of this [though I think I already have]."   So, there.  I'm one confused girl.  Still scared.  But I try to be less scared.  I just want someone to understand everything without me telling them, because I really don't know how to say it. I tried telling my mom, but I ended up more confused, and she became sort of patronising.  Anyway, I have to stop before I go off again.
