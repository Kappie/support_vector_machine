I really should read more. There are a few books I'd really like to go get, so I might go to the mall this weekend, cuz there are a bunch of CD's I need to pick up too. I'm really starting to have very eclectic tastes in just about everything. I've come to realize that I can be whoever I want, and no one can really say anything about it. Well, I need to go study for that crazy English test tomorrow. I'll catch yall later.
