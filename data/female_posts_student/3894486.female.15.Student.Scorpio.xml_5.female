I went to wedding at like 12.30ish cuz I had to hand out programs but that was fun because I got a purty coursage and got to be in the program..the wedding was beautiful and my cousin corrinne(the bride) looked stunning! after the wedding and all the pictures were takin' we went over to see my aunt mary...later on we headed to the reception...the food was nasty till they brought out choclate covered strawberries!!!yummmmmmmmmy!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol but yeah...we danced the night away! and the pilewski boys(my dad and his brothers) were so wasted it was hysterical!! the pilewski clan is crazy! lol but yeah me and my sister whom I haven't gotten along with since we were itty bitty, bonded and danced together the whole night! it was awesome!! I loved it!!! but that was my night....the reception didn't end till like 1am so I am absolutely dead!!!
