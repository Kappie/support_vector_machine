Now I usually think that this show is a total joke, but I dunno the more I watch it the more I think that it is real. But anyways, Brandon couldn't come over last night ): But I know that I just have to try and understand with him moving and all, that he's not gonna be able to do something for a while until he's all unpacked. It's been 3 weeks and one day today between us...he asked me out on October 27th. It's funny how we've been together for so little time, yet we have so many inside jokes and memories, it feels as if we've known each other for ever. Me and Brandon I'd have to say are a perfect match, it's weird cause I always knew that there was that one person out there made just for me. But, I never knew that I would find him this quickly. It's the best feeling in the world to be with Brandon and I hope it never ends...
