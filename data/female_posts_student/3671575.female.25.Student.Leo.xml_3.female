Struggling to find that piece of myself that can write with the fluidity of a good cosmopolitan sliding down your throat, especially after a day where your feet have long since declared mutiny.  Although I fear this is just my declaration to the people of the world, that I am a failure when it comes to punctuation. What can I say I am a fan of the fragment sentence, and am in desperate fear of the dreaded semi-colon.  Perhaps this my entirely selfish and lazy way of keeping my friends in touch with my thoughts and such, or just another way to make myself feel overly important. One might never know, either seems a bit pretentious.  On a rather real, and more boring note, I am out of school for the semester. It seems in between school full time and work full time, there is not a day where I don’t have some schedule to meet. I loathe my alarm clock, which now doesn’t have to go off everyday. My big decision now is what to do with all the courses which I have taken, like where to get my degree, and of course the dreaded moment of choice, what to major in. Of course, my primary interest Psychology and Nursing, however, I will have to make it specific and final. This has always been one of my biggest fears… In other news, my back injuries from a car accident I was in about a year ago have put me out of work for a bit. I started with epidural injections, then facet injections, and now on to a different therapy. I am confident, however, between my time off and the new treatment that I will be looking soon at some relief. I have learned a whole lot how much your body depends on your back being in good shape, and have had the bad experience in learning that chronic pain does not make for a good tempered Jen. In fact, I found myself more bitter and angry than I’d even been. My negativity was consuming. I found myself changing from the ideal of the person whom I’ve struggled to become. A gracious, kind-hearted, sometimes clumsy and over zealous at times, but nonetheless, good-natured. I am in search of the girl that I once knew I would become; I am search of her love and laughter. I will find her again…perhaps this my path.
