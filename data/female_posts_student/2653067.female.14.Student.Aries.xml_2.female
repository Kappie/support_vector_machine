As usual, it was locked so I made the effort of kneeling down to get the house key out of my bag.  I held on the the key tightly and inserted it into the lock.  I jiggled it around a little bit, took it out of the lock, grabbed the door handle and pushed into it.  Nothing happened.  Thinking that I had not unlocked the door properly, I tried to unlock it again.  The door remained closed.  Frustrated, I rang the doorbell constantly, I figured that Jasmine was on the other side of the door and was trying to make a joke.  After I looked in the window and saw that Jasmine wasn't there, I figured that the door is broken.  A few minutes later, I walk over to the side of the house and try the side door.  The lock was fine but the door was locked from the inside so it wasn't much help.  Several moments later, I walk to the back of the house.  The back door was locked and all the windows were aswell.  Jasmine then arrived and asked why I was outside.  I explained to her what happened with the door and told her to go to the neighboors to ask them for help or to call our mom.  Jasmine called and got the neighboor to come over and check out the door.  15 minutes passed.  The neighboor got the door unlocked and we were then able to go inside.    After having my door do this to me, I have concluded that it was probably trying to get revenge on me.
