I have the keys in my pocket and I'm going to take my first independent trip in a few minutes--to Mr. Francis's house, no less. I don't think the implications have hit me yet, but it's so much more freedom for me. I know Mom and Dad will place restrictions, but what the hell, I won't test them quite yet. It's just so awesome. I almost thought I wasn't going to pass, too, since I kind of stopped at a stop sign and then I officially stopped somewhere in front of the limit line, but it was all right.  And for once, I'm not hungry. I guess being sick gets to you that way.  So yeah, no more bumming rides, though I still owe people (namely Jess). A little more sense of self-worth. Oh, it's a sweet victory; I've been waiting for this for ages.   If only I could get rid of this nasty cold.
