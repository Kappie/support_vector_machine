He's flying out today but since it's such a long flight, it probably won't be until tomorrow when he gets back into the States.  Yay!!!  I'm so excited for them!  It's been so hard for the both of them this past year with him being in Japan.  Not to mention the fact that it was their first year of marriage.  But now he's coming home, wooooooohoooooooooo!  Of course this means that they're going to be moving to North Carolina soon.  Probably within the next two to three weeks.  That'll suck, because I won't ever get to see them.  But when you think about it, how often do I get to see Shelley anyway and she's right here in town.  I will have to spend some extra time with her before they leave for NC.  If I can get her out of the house, if you know what I mean.    I'm working all day today because I don't have class.  Then tomorrow classes start, and I'm going to be super-busy.  I'll have one of my math classes from 8-930am on Monday-Thursday, then my second math class will be from 415-715pm on Tuesday-Thursday.  Not too happy about having to be away in the evenings, but it's what I have to do.  However, it's only for a month.  Not too big of a deal.  I sure will be glad once it's over though...  Yet super-nervous because then I go into student-teaching!    I need to get off here so that I can start getting ready for work.  Have a great day!!!
