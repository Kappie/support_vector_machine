Some people could argue that this is a good thing, but I just found some things out. Things that should make me jealous. But I'm not. I'm not jealous. I can't feel this emotion that has driven me to do the stupidest things in the past.   Is it because I can't care enough about something to cry when I know it's not, and never will be true? Do I just not have it in me to love something so much that once it's no longer mine, I feel worthless and lost?I hope that's not true. Maybe it's not. Maybe I'm finally becoming the person I want to be.  I've always had this ability to love. Atleast, people think I have. If I can't be counted on to do anything else, people count on me to love them, be there for them, and  care  about how they feel.  This is the person I wanted....want to be. I want to be selfless and generous and caring. I want to be someone who will put others' feelings before my own.  All the time .  I've pretended to be this person for so long. I felt so fake, though. This wasnt natrual. I felt like I was forcing myself to care about other people and forget about myself. People would ask me sometimes: "How the hell are you always so nice?". I'd tell them that it was just how I was.   I lied.  I want everyone (who cares) to know this: It's hard. It's so hard for me to be the person everyone sees me as. It's not who I am. It's who I wish I was. I don't know...it's hard.   Maybe there is some truth to the Maddie people see. There has to be something inside me that makes me want to be like this so badly.  I want to care.  I really do.  Maybe this lack of jealousy isn't because I didn't care enough about what I lost. Hopefully it's because, finally, I'm truly being who I want to be. And I'm happy for my friends, because I know they're happy.  And that's all I could ask for.  That, and for the snow to fucking stop!
