I realize this while I'm talkin to Shannon L., and I attempted to guzzle the drink, hoping it runs in the family (seriously, my dad can gulp down a 16 oz in one breath).  I'm about a third of the way through, and my eyes are watering...I'm about ready to spit it out cause it burns sooo bad.  Luckily, I didn't, especially since I was standing near someone who I really didn't want to spit all over, plus a bunch of people in my chemistry class who would be a tad pissed if I spit coke on them.  Never doin that again. Found a few more pictures, but I forgot to upload them...theres a cute one of my cousin and her date almost kissing (pause for a collective awwww).  Can't wait till tomorrow and Friday.  That reminds me, I have English hw (like Hamlet, hate Boswell's assignments on them). Thank goodness that SOLs are over.  History and English were "ridiculously easy," to quote Julie Ann, but the chemistry was really really hard.  I'm just hoping that I passed.  It's funny, cause I managed at least a teensy bit of studying (in the form of, "Ashley, quick, call these to me" like two seconds before the test started in History) for History and English, but the one I needed to study for, Chemistry, I did absolutely no studying for.  What the hell is the empirical formula, and why the hell will I need to know it in the real world?  While we're on what the hell type sentences, what the hell is the Nisei, the Bataan Death March [yea Shaheen thanx for tellin me it's in the middle east...it's right around the Philippines (update: she was talking about Bataar, not Bataan)].  Another thing, why the hell do we need to know Jonas Salk?  If that's what keeps me from a perfect score or close to a perfect score in History, I'm gonna be pissed (or keeping with the hell theme, mad as hell). On a totally unrelated topic, I believe shivers are the best way to gauge how good something is.  I don't mean those grossed out shivers, or shivers from being cold, or some kind of weird dance thing.  I mean those shivers u get at the end of a terrific song, or a stunning movie, or a powerful TV show.  For example, I was listening to country on the way home, and I heard that song "Don't take the girl" (dunno who sings it), and I was shivering like mad, even though the car said it was like 80 degrees outside.  I still shiver when I hear little Jenny's voice on Forrest Gump ("he's my Jennae," rite Ashley and Monica...don't worry about it, its not sum1 I like).  I think the best shivers are the ones you get when ur lookin rite at some1 special, especially rite in the eyes, and he's glancing right back at u (again dont worry bout it no1 i like rite now no matter what u say). Well I g2g...suppose I should explain the title.  My stomach hurts...stupid Jennae (my sister Jennifer).  Later.
