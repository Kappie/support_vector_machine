Let’s just face reality and accept the truth that everything changes. We people encounter a lot of changes in us. It may either be the changes in our personality, in our being, in our body, in our environment or the people around us. Some changes occur fleetly, it’s like a flash without knowing that it suddenly happened and some changes occur sluggish, it’s as slow as a swamp turtle. These are just normal things that happen to us… and it’s really hard dealing with it. It might cause a bad or a good outcome. But the best way to deal with it is to accept these changes.   I do believe people change. Some people change for the better… for the best… and sometimes to make things worst. I’ve been facing a lot a changes happening to my life. I myself, admits that I’ve changed!!! I knew I was greatly influenced with the experiences I’m going through. Maybe some people might have noticed that changes in me. Maybe, it indeed evokes a good out come. Or maybe it evokes a bad one. I may not know the answer, but I, myself know that I am truly happy with the new being I am. There were also changes with the people that surround me. At first it was hard for me to admit and to face a lot of things happening in my life. I’ve encountered a lot of problems in my own home. I grieve. I cried. I felt really down. But nothing happened. The problem still haunts me. And so the best thing I did was to engage myself with this world and learn to adjust. I even encounter “culture shocks” that made me realize that this person have changed a lot!!! And I just can’t believe how that person was so indifferent from being the “old” one before. I never knew how that happened…. And how it suddenly occurs??!!! Really surprising isn’t it?… but we’ve got nothing to do but to accept it!!! That’s Life and we should just go with the flow. Though sometimes these changes hurts us. Lets just learn to ACCEPT and to ACCOMODATE with it…Ü
