Lately and at every turn life has been trying to get me down and normally I let it, but lately I just can't seem to make myself sweat the small stuff.  Life is good, Matt and I have a great relationship, and though we are not where we'd like to be, we will be someday.  I have also been rather inspired of late.  I am starting to write more, screw the technical difficulties!  I realized that if I don't just jump in with both feet and do it, I may never do it at all.  My skidish concern for weather I know enough about grammar or have great story ideas is flying out the window.  I really am trying to look at my life more positively -which is something I don't do, ever!    Normally I'm the worlds BIGGEST pessimist!!!  As anyone who knows me, they'll tell you that the glass is always way less than half-empty for me.  Normally I let life get me down, crawl into a little corner and cry... But lately I just can't make myself do it!  Three cheers for me!!!  So while I am not sure how long my new found optimism will last, I am hoping it will last a very long time.  I really like the feeling.  You only have one life after all!  On another note entirely, I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of  Incubus Dreams  by Laurell K. Hamilton.  Its the next book in the Anita Blake Series -which I can't get enough of!  Laurell is a great, fabulous writer.  I only hope that someday I can be a great writer like that!  I ordered from a girl online a picture of one of the scenes from one of the books, and it's a great drawing, I am really enjoying it.  She's a really talented artist... check out her site  urlLink purple passions .    Okay, I am going for now.  I hope that all of you are having as good a time about life as I am.    ~Kristyn
