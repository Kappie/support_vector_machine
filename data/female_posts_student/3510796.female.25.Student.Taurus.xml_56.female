Pretty much got into it and ended up dancing in the kitchen.  Oh well.  It's MY kitchen!!  DMB plays tonight in New York, oh how lucky they are.    On a more disturbing note, there was an article in the paper today about a woman who left her two kids in her car,ages 10 months and 3 years,with the windows just cracked, FOR 3 HOURS!  Now the court has to prove that she left them alone knowing it would harm them.  This happened in 2002, and the temperature that day was 88.  She went into a salon to get her hair done.  Gives new meaning to  Missy Elliott, get my hair did .     LOS ANGELES (July 2) - Marlon Brando, who revolutionized American acting with his Method performances in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and ''On the Waterfront'' and went on to create the iconic character of Don Vito Corleone in ''The Godfather,'' has died. He was 80.  Brando died at an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital Thursday, attorney David J. Seeley said Friday. The cause of death was being withheld, Seeley said, noting the actor ''was a very private man.''   I got an email today from tCj telling me that she read the story and I guess she is still trying to decide who the winner will be.  It has been mentioned to me to write more, but I feel like there is only so many ways you can talk about sex.  My creative side has been dormant since high school.  Maybe its time to let it out.    peace.love.dmb.
