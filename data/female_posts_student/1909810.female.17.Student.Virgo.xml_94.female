It sounds like a therapy session but rather than the therapist being on the outside, she's on the inside so she's upset while asking my father about reasons for things, her tone of voice though, I can't even explain it.  Maybe this is normal married couple conversation...if it is...I don't think I wanna get married. She drives me crazy.  I'm just gonna stop, and try to not listen to their conversation at the moment.  bleeehhhhhh
