I put my heart, my soul, my everything into this game.  Then my partner screws up and we loose.  I have been crying ever since.   I can't hold it in.  Its not only this game... its the frusterations of this entire season.  All the sweat.  all the time.  All my everything.  I put it in to tennis.  I don't deserve to loose.  I have tried harder than anyone on my team.  I have shed more tears.  I have practiced.  I have spent so many hours.  I know I am better than this.  I don't deserve to be the worst.  Everyone on the team just thinks I am bad  But I am not.  sigh.  I wish I were dead.  I am going to go cry until there is not a single tear left in my eye..  until they turn as red as a skittle.  Then I am just going to lay in my bed and never get up.  Or maybe I will just die tomorrow.  Then everything would be better...
