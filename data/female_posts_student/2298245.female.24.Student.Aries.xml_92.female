First of all, it made me feel a lot better about myself on a day when I really need that, so praise the Lord for that.  Second of all, it made me think, because I never really thought of my decision to come to law school as admirable, or anything close to it.  To me, it was the easiest choice to make at the time.  I always thought it was a bit of a cop out for me to come straight to law school from college, without even trying to make it in the real world.  I always felt like I was running away from something, deferring growing up for as long as possible.  It just goes to show that what seems like an easy or compromising decision to you can seem to be the most difficult and arduous decision to someone else.  And we don't often get to find out how other people really view us; it doesn't often come up in conversation.  I don't know what any of this means; I'm nearly delirious from lack of sleep and studying for Tax, but it just struck me as interesting.  It made me re-evaluate the way I look at myself, and made me think that maybe I should give myself the benefit of the doubt, and not assume that every decision I've ever made in my entire life was to put myself in the most comfortable situation as possible.   And it's so true, because law school may be many things, but comfortable is not one of them.
