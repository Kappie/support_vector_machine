Today, Im going to try and go shopping. For what? I dont know. Just to go and get out of the house. Or maybe I'll take my mom out to lunch/dinner. Yeah, that sounds like a good plan. Drew left for Maryland yesterday and didnt even call to say goodbye. Oh well. Maybe we need the break from each other. But, what he said Thursday night on IM really hurt me. He tells me he loves me, and I beleievd him. And I fell in love with him. I know I love him, and I want to be with him. But he said that 'I dont love him and all Im doing is looking for another hookup.' And that really hurt. When you love someone you take up their side, no matter if their right or wrong. And you believe them over anyone, no matter what they have done in the past. I would usually take it and move on and still love him. But not this time. It's going to hurt now, but I guess it will be better in the long run. Maybe we are supposed to be together, but not right now. I'm going to try to be friends with him, if he lets me. Wow, we've heard this before... But this time im going to stick to my word.
