I must admit I have lost interest at this point as to who the nominee will be, since I am just to the bad side of ambivalent about Kerry, who it seems now is almost certain to be the nominee, though it is not "official" just yet.  But read the piece anyway, for a thoughtful and nuanced position...from the left (I don't care what Hitchens' compatriots on the left say about his so-called political conversion - he is still a man of the left)...on the importance of the issue of the "War on Terror" (for lack of a better designation) in the upcoming election.  If ever I were to advocate voting based on a single issue, this would be it.  Hitchens puts it much better than I ever could, but the if the problem of terrorism (both foreign and domestic) is not dealt with, if it is not front and center on the agenda until the problem is significantly eradicated, then the other issues simply don't matter.
