There are so many things I want to talk about, but I'm just going to have to limit myself a little bit longer.  So I'll just do the highlights:  Sunday:  Saddam was captured.  If anyone missed this, then I pity you and your little oblivious self.  I don't know how big this is, politically speaking.  I mean, I don't know how much it changes, because I think Bush was pretty much unbeatable before.  This certainly doesn't help the Democrats in general, though I think it might help some and hurt others, though it is really too early to tell how all the reactions will pan out.  Apparently, Dean believes that capturing Saddam does not make the U.S. safer.  And maybe he is right.  But the other Democrats, particularly Lieberman, Kerry, and Gephardt have jumped on these comments.  So only time will tell who it helps and who it hurts.  It should be interesting to see what happens in New Hampshire next month, to see if the Dean magic starts to slip away.  As for me, I'd like to see it help Lieberman, as he's the only Democrat I'd consider voting for out of this crew.  Also on Sunday was the Great Con Law Review.  It was fun.  No, really, it was.  Monday:  The sickness came over me.  Didn't get as much studying done as I should have.  Was very lazy.  Tuesday:  The Torts final.  Thankful that it is over, but wish it had been a wee bit easier...oh yes, and more than that I wish I'd been taught something by the professor to help me on the exam.  But perhaps this is asking too much.  The evening was much better.  I got to hang out with cool friends and eat food that was really bad for me - well, I always eat food that is really bad for me, but the cool friends thing was nice.  Then, I wimped out on them, got lazy, and went home to watch hours on end of TV, the highlight of which was "24."  I can't say enough good things about this show.  I missed it last week, which was very disappointing because a lot happened - luckily I know cool people who were willing to take the time to fill me in - but this week was really good also.  I only started watching it this season (over the break I hope to be able to watch the first two seasons on DVD), but so far, I really like what I've seen.    I swear there are few things better than good television.  Maybe good gin.  And good food. And good friends, of course.  All four, and I'd think I'd died and gone to heaven.  There's all the latest.  Now, back to work.  But never fear...I shall return.  And sooner than you'd think or want.
