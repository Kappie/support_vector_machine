Eric was there and he was fucking annoying like last time so I gave his brother a water balloon and had him hit him with it for me it was cool. Me and merri and everyone had a huge water balloon/italian ice fight and i got covered and soaking wet. I was kidding around and I put a water balloon down my shirt and said i had a third boob and then it popped right in my shirt. I was drencheddd. *sneezesneezecoughhh* x.x bleh I got sunburned a little cuz i didn't put on sunscreen boohoo. oh well it doesn't hurt too bad. We played DDR at like 1 am and i'm very bad at it i kept getting E's on light mode and D's on easy. I suck and can't dance on arrows. oh well. The most fucking hilarious thing happened at the block party. These guys who were only one year older than me were wasteddd drunk and they got in the middle of the dance floor, took the microphone from the DJ, made him put on Backstreet boys "I want it that way" and started singing it at the top of their lungs. They were dancing sooo gay to it and we went over and watched them and we were on the ground laughing our asses off. It was so funny. Rory was at the block party and I don't really like her cuz she acts like a man and at one point she even put joey in a headlock he's only 10...that's stupid. I dealt with her though.      Simon why you always make posts about girls at work and stuff. Just wondering...   I surrounded by guys in school and none of them like me and everyone always tells me i'm pretty so i don't get it. I don't think it has anything to do with the way you look i think it's cuz your quiet and shy, i'm quiet and shy too. People just leave quiet people alone because they are intimidated by them. People would much rather be around a person who is loud and talks alot you know. You can't change your personality though just let things happen instead of wondering why cuz if you always wonder then you'll drive yourself insane. There isn't anything wrong with you you just haven't found right person yet who likes a quiet personality. Don't worry about it there are tons of girls in the world. *coughcoughxlikexmexcoughcoughsneeze* But you know like if that girl does like you then you should go for it you just have to find some confidence it doesn't have to be alot just a little...      *sighcougohcoughcoughcough!*      After Merri's block party i went to my cousin's grad party for 10 mins and i found out i have these cousins who are insane. This kid is like 7 and he kept grabbing my boobs and my sister's boobs and walking up to us and saying wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world and squealing really loudly. Ugg it was annoying he was cute though in his own weird way haha.      AHHH I CAN'T TAKE THIS SICKNESS ANYMORE! *crawls into bed and pulls covers over head*      bai people
