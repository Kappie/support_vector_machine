Something like my cell phone used to be her best pal's old phone.  She leaves me puzzled. This is an example of what she makes conversation with me:  Mystery Girl supposedly female age 14-17: Oh God, Tessa, why aren't you there?  I need you to call me *sniffle*.  Andy's been acting weird and...Oh god.....*blows nose*....I need you to call me....What if he dumps me, Tessa?  Do you think he thinks i'm.....ugly? *sniffle*  Oh Jeez...Everyone's saying i'm too clingy.  He probably think i'm too faaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!!!! *bursts out in tears* I think he's going to dump me, Tess.  He hasn't called me for 2 days.  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!  I really need your comfort. *whimper*  Me: *groggily*  It's 4 am.  Why did you call me?  Mystery Girl: Is this Tessa?  Me:  No...  Mystery Girl: Put Tessa on.  Me: This is my cell phone.  I don't know Tessa. You must have the wrong number. I have a tip for you.  Don't be so clingy about this Andy guy whatever.  Also, don't call your friend at this time.  She might be sleeping unless she lives on the other side of the world and if so, you should call her home number.  Goodnight.  Next few nights she called me a few more times before she got the message.  Ugh.
