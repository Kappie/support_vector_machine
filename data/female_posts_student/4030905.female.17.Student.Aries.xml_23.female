Priscilla asked a question in the bible study material: How do you confess your sin?  I was very sleepy and bored, so an answer came to my mind. And of course, I shared my answer. See ah..to confess sin.  Step 1: Commit a sin. Without a sin, how can you ever confess?? Step 2: Do some reflection about the sin. Step 3: Confess and you shall be forgiven.  Common sense answer right? No sin, how to confess? So must commit a sin in order to confess. haha..nonsense la.  I was very satisfied with my meals today. Didn't eat breakfast. Had one energy bar, two packet of watermelon, one packet of honeydew for lunch. And of course, sweets during lesson time. As usual. For dinner, I had one packet of hello panda, one kiwi and one green apple.  Hope to lose more weight. No pain no loss.
