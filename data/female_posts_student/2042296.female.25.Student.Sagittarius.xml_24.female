NO, I won't let that happen! It's just so difficult for me to study in the day time, when there are so many other things to do. In the evening it'd be better, but then Rico is here. He doesn't disturb me but I keep on getting disturbed by him. His presence is enough to keep me from reading.  I missed my friends like hell yesterday. I talked long to Leena, one of my best friends, in MSN Messenger, but that only made my home sickness worse ;) Yesterday was also otherwise such a stupid day again...  Actually, what the fuck am I whining about my doing nothing here instead of DOING something? I'm sometimes such a sad creature ;)
