She is her own person and i love that about her. She is amazing in everything she does (get ya mind outta da gutter) and i love how she doesnt care what others think. She's really something. :D love ya girl.*  I'm sitting here talking to Mikel. He tells me he saw his friend Brad Gentry at walmart. Brad and i go to school together but yet i dont personally know him but he's in my spanish class. He starts talking about this "cheerful blonde girl" and the more the conversation goes on about this "girl" mikel realizes its me he's talking about. haha   Mikel: He just mentioned this cheerful little blonde girl. He didn't know your name, but we talked for a while, and I'm like "WAIT is it Julia ?" and he's like "Yea, okay, that's the girl"  haha well i guess he wasn't talking bad about me, he doesnt even know me, and mikel wouldnt have mentioned it if he was talking shit..lol but hey, i like it when people say good things about me to people they dont think know me!! hahaha   Jordan is going over to my friend sarah sampson's house to see her friend amber, this new chick he likes. He wanted me to go but hes going after 9 and he cant drive past 9 so his mom is taking him. dammit..i cant go now cuz i figured he would drive me, but nooo, and my mom isnt going to take me to sarah's house all the way in dobson in the middle of the night. I dont know his mom but what mom takes her kid out at 9 about 30mins away and then turns around to go get him in a few hours...dude...lol he is the only child. i guess that has something to do with it. I betcha he doesnt even get to go..hahaha that would be funny. i do want to go with him , so maybe he'll change his mind and go one afternoon to her house to meet amber. I just want to go so i can see how they get along together! haha   I've finally decided i'm offically OVER Lorne. I don't think about him anymore and i've already told Kristen that i dont like him. IT'S OFFICAL. I'm glad he said he didnt care, takes more off my mind. i havent talked to him at all today.  One more day until my daddy comes out!! yay!!! Going to the mall...going shopping...getting to see him...YIPPEEE!! I need a boyfriend. lol
