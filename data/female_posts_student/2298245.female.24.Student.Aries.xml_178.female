For instance, it would never occur to me to ask for an extension on something due at school, even for a one-on-one project (like my directed research) simply because in my mind, things are due when they are due.  I tend to think of due dates as immutable.  It wasn't until I was talking with my professor, and I asked him to confirm the due date for my research outline, that he suggested that if I am a little behind it would be OK to turn it in late.  Now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense.  Obviously, he'd prefer to have it in on Friday.  But he'd also prefer it to be well-done.  Me, I'd half-throw it together to get it in on time, rather than take into consideration that he might not want to read it that way, and would rather a better finished product, even if that means that it takes more time.    That said, I may not take the extra time anyway, because something still seems wrong about it, to me.  Like I'm getting preferential treatment or something.  Which I guess isn't always such a big deal - it happens all the time really.  I guess I'm just extra-sensitive about it because I grew up taking ballet from my mom, and she was always going the extra mile to make sure it didn't seem like I was getting favored treatment.  It's kind of ingrained in me.  Which just goes to show: no matter how rational we are about anything, old habits die hard.
