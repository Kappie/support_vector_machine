I think that Katie Sims has only convinced herself that she makes no sense because there is no evidence that it has been said or the idea even put forward by anyone else.   Also the idea that she is stressed could have just be brought around by her imagination, as a way to explain how she is feeling right now.  (GRRRRRRR I sound like an agony aunt, back to essay!)  Mayby Katie should consider aromotherepy or hitting Izzy as a way to let her stress and anger out.  It is my opinion that two, no actually three of the best ways to combat stress and anger are; 1)Do some house cleaning, imagine that the surfaces are the cause of your problems and work away at them untill they sparkle. 2)Go for a run/jog/walk, and let your legs feel as though the weight is sliding of of them and that your stress and anger is coming away as your legs get lighter. or 3)Punch the lights out of the person that is at the source of your anger and stress.  I hope that this has helped you and that you enjoyed my essay!
