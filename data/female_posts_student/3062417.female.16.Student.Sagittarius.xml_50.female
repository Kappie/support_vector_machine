I thought the essays were hardish but I'm not at liberty to discuss the test because I signed at confidentiallity statement. lol. So I ended up only going to 2 classes today. Good deal huh? And I found out that my solo fest time is at 3:15 in room WWR. And then I went to Kim's softball game with Carol and Sarah. They kicked Poland's ass like 15-0. Yay for them. And now I'm home about to eat dinner and then I'm going to Wards for ice cream and then I'm practicing for solo fest all night.  So thats what's going on. And now I'm leaving because I'm bored.
