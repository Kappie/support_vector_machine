To Officer Salerno:  your rude attitude, condescending manner and ability to write me 2 tickets while threatening to give me a myriad of others will just give me the aggrivation to get motivated to get a work out done.     To Andrew:  for putting up with my insanity this past weekend.  I appreciate your patience and your ability to cheer me up when I'm in one of my moods.  You're the best. *mwah!*
