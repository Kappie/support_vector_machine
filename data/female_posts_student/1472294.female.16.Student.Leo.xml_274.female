But in reality, silver seems pure, to me. ~.^  What was the last film you saw at the movies? : "Fantasia" or something like that. It features TWINS, Jordan Chen, and others. I watched it during New Year's eve. Oh, did I tell you I am not really a sucker for movie? I will only watch my fav "Harry Potter"... (drools)  Favorite cartoon/anime? : Anime ah.... I have not watch anime for a long time already, neither do I watch cartoons... Oh! I remembered! I watched "Black Jack" a few weeks ago at Arts Central. "Black Jack" is not really a anime, right? But I really love to watch! It is always late in the night because of it's not very "suitable rating" for kids. Ya, I will be looking out for "Black Jack" comics...  What did you have for breakfast this morning? : Nothing. I rushed out for my dental appointment and later went out with my friends for breakfast cum lunch. So I took wanton noodles.  Who would you love being locked in a room with? : As in human being? Nobody in particular. But I really love to lock in with Doremon coz it has everything I need and want! Ya, there was this incident and joke about Doremon we had this afternoon. Haha!  Could you live without your computer? : Not really. But I can live without it for a few days. But not forever! 0_o  Would you color your hair? : Yes, I have already colored my hair already. So far, so good. No Discipline Master tailing me or asking me to dye back. But in the future, I better leave it to the hairstylists....  Could you ever get off the computer? : Ha, I am very good at it! Give me half an hour, and I will automactically get off. Unlike my brother, he will take more than an hour to get off after playing his RPG the whole night.... -__-  How many people are on your buddy list? : 47 in all. 6 close friends and remaining are all classmates. No cousins or relatives.
