The Hong Kong Observatory put up the amber rainstorm signal, so Step phoned early in the morning that her mom didn't allow her to come...hum...that certainly had lessen my excitment...... Nevermind...then changed into "beach style", packed loads of snacks, food and drinks and leave home at 8:30a.m.  Many fds and relatives have already arrived the Kowloon City Port when we arrived. well...this cruising really involved many parties...haha....my whole big family, dad's boss and his son, 8 ventures, another scout leader and his friends...about 28 ppl in total...wou..  The ship...oh..shall I call it a ship? ...It's not VERY beautiful, but comfortable enough...air-conditioned cabin, can sing K ^^", and spacious coz the ship was for 40-50ppl originally... It started off at 9 sth towards Sai Kung 大浪西灣. It took about 1.5-2 hrs...We took photos, played cards, ate snacks, rested..................and arrived 大浪西灣 at about 11:30. I knew that it was beautiful, just I havn't been there before.......It's really beaufitul...yeah...^^" Sky was clear...waters clean and blue...and the beach was NOT crowded....   I and my cousin coz immediately jumped off from the second "floor" of the ship into the deep cool water..haha...It was the first time I jumped off from THAT tall...^^" a little bit nervous before jumping...but....erm...erm...erm....I couldn't be beaten by my one-yr smaller cousin! right!??? haha....tell you...the fright when you look down the sea before jumping and the 離心feel when jumping is .....similar to that you're playing 跳樓機!!! or even more frightened  hah!   Al'right...then we swam straight towards the sandy beach..about..150-200m...on my way towards the beach...guess what was on my mind? SHARK!!!!!! Man...I've watched SO many Amercian shark scary film....^^" My motive was to swimswim and swim until I reach the shore before I saw any dark figures under the sea...^^"   The sand there was .....sandy.....real small grains...I couldn't even find small rocks there....so beautiful....a venture brought a floating bed and we played for half an hr...Then I and Cheron (my cousin) swan back to the ship...This time the "jorney" was shortened coz of the tides...  We were the first one to jump off the ship..and we were also the first one to have lunch...hehe...快, 是最緊要的嘛.....We've chicken wings, 糯米雞, some 內臟s...^^", sausage and pineapple....so on and so on.....After some time, we again jumped off and swam towards the shore again....-_-" under that sunny sun....( It was after I went home and bath and saw that VERYVERY deep swimming suit SEAL on my back, then could I sense how stubborn I was not to apply suncream on my back...-_-" my back really burns....my shoulders so painful...sigh....I mean...you always get so excited when playing and won't think of the consequence...you don't usually care much...-_-" and that's it....except those part covered by my swimming suit...all other skins are darkened 99%...-_-" really wanted to scream when I first saw the mark on my back...-_-" dammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammit!)  okok...then we played on the beach and then swam back to the ship....jumped off the ship again and again...-_-" Then played "cum" 棉" toi" with the venture. They said the one who lose have to jump off the ship...haha...of coz I was not the one who have to jump...I'm sooooo quick-to-react....hehe...We played til 4:00pm and had to return. We chatted about scouts...CEs (others)...and many other things....um....in fact we were just 7+1ing... nth special...We arrived Kowloon City Port early...  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The first thing dad did when arrived back home was of coz turned on TV...^^" 天龍八部finale....=P Then I watched The Apprentice finale...Bill won...^^" The finale was really exciting...made me couldn't sleep until 2...-_-" I had like....sleeping-on-a-boat feel already...and I was SO tired...and my back and face burned...-_-" red hot....so damn uncomfortable....later I slept...*fainting..so tired* ..^^"  but still...cool day....
