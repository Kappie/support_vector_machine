Sex...it's a nebulous thing ain't it?  i, for one, am very confused as to whether this era of sexual renaissance for women is anathema to feminists or a byproduct of their cause (i guess it would depend on whether i'm talking about feminists or post feminists...?).  on the one hand, there's no use denying that sex sells, and this can be no more evident than the four week winning streak of the females on the apprentice (best reality show by far!).  on the other hand, we refuse to be viewed as sex objects, sincerely hoping to be esteemed for our brain and not our boobs.  but regardless of where the glass ceiling hits in the office, i guess the media is at least catching on to the concept that women have a need for fulfillment in the bedroom just as much as men.  for this service done to female sexuality and equality in the bed, bath  beyond, I say hurrah!...with bated breath.  I think it's great that women are no longer ashamed of our bodies and our sexualities (if you have any doubt that we ever were, please remember that corset-wearing and foot-binding and muslim veils were all imposed upon women  by  women!), but I hope men aren't gonna overzealously misconstrue this as a season pass to having sex with any girl that shows interest.  to be fair, i guess i can kinda see it from a guy's point of view, circumstantially speaking.  Girl dresses promiscuously, girl wittingly situates herself in a drunken orgy of strapping libidos, girl makes sexual innuendos, girl basically gives off every signal that she is willing to have sex.  Now  urlLink research  done by some bored peeps at a canadian university have proven that men can't think straight after just looking at photos of attractive women.  can you imagine what happens to these fools when they're completely aroused??  but i gotta say, especially in light of the recent colorado football rape charges, the bottom line is that once the girl says no, at any point in time, the guy has got to stop. cuz that's the law. so regardless of evolving sex roles, no still means no, and so does "zzzzzzzzzzz" for that matter.  the second thing that kinda concerns me is how sexual pleasures are being openly promoted without some warning label like "to be used only by the sexually responsible."  i mean if they make them for hot coffee, i don't see why they don't make them for hot sex. but seriously, don't you ever wonder how Samantha on sex and the city could have sex with the whole city of new york (and probably some peripheral states) and not have contracted some form of STD by now??  i absolutely LOVE that show, but i think that was an irresponsible oversight on the part of the writers. I mean, I totally understand the whole physicological aspect about peeps needing to be sexually actively ( urlLink this  even says it contributes to good healthy and longevity), and I don't think peeps ought to be judged on whether they're having premarital sex or not vis-à-vis the many other things to measure a person's character by. But still, too many peeps out there are having babies who shouldn't be, or suffering a lifetime of pain for a few minutes of pleasure. so i came upon this "golden rule of thumb" for sex that says peeps should only have sex with someone that we're willing to make a potential baby with, and somebody that we're willing to die for, literally. then maybe nobody would have to bother with that whole abortion issue, and those labrats could better spend their time looking for a cure for cancer instead of aids.  so yeah...about that essay on campaign finance reform...
