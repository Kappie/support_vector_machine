YESYESYESYES!!!! of course it is but then i remembered our little money crisis, aparently we didnt have enough cash in her savings account and our hopkins house was sold for less then our new one, and mom wanted to pay in cash... were a bit chort on money... Is she trying to buy thisLOVE she speaks of from me? if its that, then what      the       fuck! she also said that Bill was going to move out(again, he already has had an appartment for about the past 8 months, but doesnt live there because apparentl;y(again) somebody wants to kill him.so he thinks its safe endangering his mother and cuddley baby sister!), that were going to rent it out. there goes my second bedroom....yeah.. elliot found two mice in the shed today after the gasoline canister got knocked over. he then tried to kill them. there was a hole in the floor that they went through so he took the gas canister and POURED and sloshed it over the hole!this coming from a christian AND an 17 year old boy with his mother right outside the doors! he then blocked of the ground route to get out, and i took a really pointy, sharp, sgardening tool and jabbed it countinously into the hole. but whenever i pulled it out, there wasnt any blood...0_o
