On a more positive note I've become more interested in reading, preferably about history, which in turn increases not only my knowledge, but ability to intake knowledge, which, can be considered a good thing. So here I am, 17; a youthful age, and this time in my life is perhaps to be considered the best years of said. Too bad. My life isn't going to be too much fun now, is it? I guess you could say I have a few friends, only a handful. I do have a significant other, I'm quite fond of him actually. All in all, however, I AM sitting at home on a Friday night. Of course, in all fairness I'm being punished (for something untrue, need I say) and I do have plans for tomorrow night. Alas, my motivation for remaining awake has faded, and I know revert to a state I would prefer to be found in: sleep.
