Anyways he gives me an address(somewhere in Table View) and tells me to come to his place to claim my price at 9pm...Why the hell do u want to go to a person's house at 9pm?(a person u've neva eva met or spoken to) So i tell him, i cant make it, i'm busy i didnt plan on it... He then keeps on tlking shit. So i said, "i thought your company was sponsering this thing, so why do i need to come to ur place? Why cant i jst meet u at your work place or something?" He says... they had been trying to get in touch with me and when they couldnt, they had decided to let him keep on trying and call me later to get the car. (this is probably the lamest excuse eva!!!) After hearing this i just simply laughed and hung up the phone. A minute later he fones again saying, "why did u cut me off? Do u know how rude that is?" So then i said, "look i dont know who the fuck u are or wat u want so just leave me the hell alone!" This guy is a serious freak so he says "srry, i'm really srry i bothered you, plz forgive me!!!" I'm like wateva FUCKFACE!!! And i put the fone down on him, luckily he didnt fone back
