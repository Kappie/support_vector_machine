Everytime I try i messes up!! Today, by accident, I put a cup extra water in the rice so it was like rice soup. It was so disgusting. Who in there right mind would eat this crap?? It seems odd that everyone in all poor contries can cook rice but I can't. Totally unfair.   Hmm..  My blog has been lacking creativity lately. Doesn't that sadden you? It saddens me.  Sincce I am trying to "build and educated vocaulary" I will post some smart, yet awesome, words.  Emulate- To strive to equal or excel, usually through intimiadtion. [Is it just me or does that word sound a whole lot like mutalte? Scary.]  Stymie- To thwart [TRY ME! No STYMIE! Wow. That didn't even make sense...ignore me.]  Apocryphal- Fictitious, spurious [does anyone even get the definition????]  Okay, so those are the three words of the day, use 'em and use 'em often!  I'm out like a man after his first frat party. [i'm a good little christian girl, I swear! I know nothing about frat parties!] Laura
