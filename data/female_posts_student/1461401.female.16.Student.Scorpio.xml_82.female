Cause I came here with a load, and it feels so much lighter now I met you. And honey you should know, that I could never go on without you."  My boy with green eyes. Not really my boy. Never was my boy. Never will be my boy. Never wanted to be my boy. Never intended to be my boy.  So why does it still hurt? I have a boy now. A boy who loves me. "Cause everybody wants everybody else." Damnit. I just want to stop wanting. I'm happy with what I have god damn it!  But what I don't have is killing me... "Cause everybody wants everybody else."  except me.
