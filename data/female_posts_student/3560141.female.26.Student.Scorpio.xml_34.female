I'm not deprived by any means or even chained to a wall with a dog dish for sustinence as I've made my current status seem to be...I'm just tired of being politically correct oh who am i kidding I miss never having to pop out the second story screen on the window, so I can smoke a cig...  So, it's been weeks, or realistically maybe just days you know since I've had a decent conversation with him....I would normally be typing away privately from some hotmail account, but I've been banned from using this form of communication...for the following reasons..1.)  put it like this if my child was missing, I'd probably just plan the funeral and skip the search party antics - translation:  I assume the worst, no room for having a bad day irrespective of me, actually nothing to do with me... 2.)  if I was a boxer, I'd hold up my opponent's glove and just consistently plant it square on the jaw, and bite my own ear off - translation:  I create my own dilemnas that seem insurmountable, my own worst enemy...how can anyone else solve my own problems..without medication..hmmmm 3.)  If there were a slight escalation in the wind velocity, I've grabbed my keys headed to the nearest grocery store, picked up bottled water, batteries, and a first aid kit...I've turned off all my fuses and I sit in the dark till the "storm" arrives - translation:  in addition to number 1, any small change, minor alteration in routine,  probably means everything's gone to shit...to hell...to the heaps of shit in hell. 4.)  If I got a tattoo that said "Om", the next week it would say "mOm", she would probably piss me off, and I would change it to "mOmOney", then I'd get sick of Puffy dancing the background of everyone else's videos and it would change to "mahOgany" (I don't know I ran out of creative manipulations)..point being, oh I mean - translation:  I AM FICKLE..., so e-mails conveying sentiments are not allowed, the running joke is this week I like him, but who knows depending on the weather, I may not ever speak to him again...ok so maybe it's more stable now..like I'll never not speak to him (this does not guarantee against foul four lettered words), and I'll never not have him in my life (he may be my future investor, or business partner, who knows)...  So, because he reads this...this is my passive aggressive stab at conveying, "I miss him, and sometimes my sadness translates into fiery e-mails..."..haha...  Oh yeah, a testament to just how fickle I am, in addition to the other three attributes previously described...read previous entries...
