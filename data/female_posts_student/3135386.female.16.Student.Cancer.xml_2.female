On the radio it was like 'Cancelled', 'cancelled', 'cancelled', 'and in **** ****, it's day 6! *eyeroll*. So anyway, I stagger to school, (it's that familiar, walk one step forward, two steps back that we're used to with winter. Get to school, and then the snow starts to fall. Again. But no, not in time to cancell the buses.   Go to first two classes, then dash between the two schools to go to band class. Get back into the highschool at lunch to find out that the buses have been cancelled, and that storm billets are being called to find out what to do with everybody who rides bus.  The office had probably 30-40 people crammed around it with people trying to use on of the two phones we have. Wisely, after grabbing a quick lunch, Robin and I head to the library where I know there is a phone that will be free. (This is just one of the many benefits of knowing the librarian on a first name basis. *grins*)  So I phone dad and get permission to go home. Robin does the same, and so we leave with Cara, our grade 12 friend, and her dad gives us a ride home. After a harrowing ride down main street, (lets just say, her dad likes to talk and gesture at the same time,"steering wheel? What steering wheel?") we finally get home.  Robin and I set up the anime chair, and watch about 6 episodes of Gravitation on the computer, the phone ringing constantly. Triss rang me up asking if I needed a ride into work. I said sure, since dad's stuck at work and mum's stuck in a city 2 1/2 hours away because the roads are closed. Then, a friend of mum's phones up and asks if her kids can come here, since she's working a double shift at the hospital. I say sure, as long at they don't mind being by themselves for a few hours 'cause I have to work. (The kids are 13 and 15) Immediatly, I phone Jordan (the librarian) and ask if she can work for me this evening, if I look after her kids in return. She said she'd pull some strings. (And these phone calls were made after several wrong numbers, busy lines, among other things)   Right after that, mum's friend phones up and said her husband actually made it into town and would be able to take her kids home. So I had to phone Jordan up and say I didn't need her to work affter all. Two hours later, and after several phone calls to mum to keep her updated on the situation, Triss phones and says she's leaving to pick me up. (work is a 5 min drive, tops) 40 mins later, she phones saying she got stuck twice getting out of the motel, and two more times down town and she can't make it here.   So, now I'm home alone, and don't have any kids showing up. *grins* Finally, I phone dad and ask him to come home, because he has to travel on the closed roads and if Triss got stuck twice in town, I want him home. So he says he's already trying to go, he's just digging himself out the drive. He gets home, and we live on a hill, right? So, he takes the hill fast to get up in the snow, pulls in to the drive, skids, and is no longer parellel with the house, he finds himself facing it. And stuck. So for the past hour he's been trying to dig himself out. It was hilarious, he was reving the engine on the truck and that freaked Dime out and she was barking, trying to nip the tires. *laughs* I got a picture and then disappeared in the house because dad's started swearing at the snow blower because it decided not to work.  LMAO! All in all, an eventful day.  I'll have to update again later.
