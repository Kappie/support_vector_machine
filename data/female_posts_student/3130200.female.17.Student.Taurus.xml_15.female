I just feel like I want to cry and assess everything I dislike about myself and how crappy my life is. I will spare you all those thoughts tonight, but eventually I will need to get around to them. Whether we like it or not.  So the family leaves tomorrow night...without me. That's my decision. It is far less excruciating staying here with my grandparents than it is to spend 4 days with my younger siblings and parents. At least when I am at home I can hop in the jeep and drive away. The grandparents have decided to leave Sat. anyway, thank you God.  One last thing before I have to go...well...nowhere, just away. I saw  The Village  the other night and I was soo dissappointed. I absolutely loved  The Sixth   Sense.   Unbreakable  was good overall.  Signs  was nearly unbearable. And  The Village  was just abhorable. It was a waste of my money (read: my dad's money) and my very valuable time (read: I actually had nothing else to do on a Sunday night).
