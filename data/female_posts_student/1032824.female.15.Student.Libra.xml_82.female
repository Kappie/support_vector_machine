Geetha mentioned that yam biscuits would be suitable for him whereas Jess felt that Yun Nam haircare vouchers were more benifitting. i thought it would be a GREAT idea to leave   our   mobile phone numbers in a box of ferrero rocher for his 3 sons.  Regarding my previous post, difficult times have helped me to understand better than before, how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way.    urlLink Chuang Tzu  quotes, "Flow with whatever is happening and let your mind be free. stay centered by accepting whatever you are doing. this is the ultimate."
