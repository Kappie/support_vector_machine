My feet are gigantuous (if that's even a word). Also, I have stupid braces that are keeping me from having my most beloved condoment: mustard... ::dreamy sigh:: I'm also wierd. I've been known as the wierd girl ever since I can remember. I'm usually really shy when I first meet people, but once I get to know them.... Well, let's just say that I become very, uh, perky? I just become my normal self, which really isn't that normal. Anyways, I'm starting High School this fall, and I'm so nervous. It also kind of sucks, because I'm not even sure if I like the class choices I'm going to take. If you guys could help me out, I'd really appreciate it. I can't decide if I should take Spanish 1 or Theater Arts.... I'm already taking Choir, which I love. And I adore Theater, but I really want to get a start on Spanish! Please help me!  Hugs and kisses!
