I won't go into them now, because I don't want to spoil it for everyone who hasn't read it, but all i can say is WOW. I'm on the reserve list for Angels And Demons now...that should be good too! This is definitely the BEST book i've read this summer, the second-best being The Lamplighter, by Anthony O'Neill. Dan Brown is SUCH a good author! Maybe in my next life I can be that good... DAMN! I think it may have been better than The Lady of Avalon. How scary is that??  Oh well, i'll stop raving about it. (Read it read it read it!!!!!) I have marquis tonight. That'll be fun! Bye, Ya'll April
