Buttttt... since i'm learning it  on my own  (yes without anyone's help! tssk), it'll prolly take me a coupla years -.-" Who knows, i might even give up in just a coupla' days. HA!  It's kinda fun though.. as i was chatting with zuhayr and  jeremy  online last night, i printed out the guitar chords and strummed 2 songs by  avril lavigne , i felt so satisfied. ;) it's very very difficult hey.. fingers pain le. I think i should get some tips from  bingrui  and  huizhen (whitney) then go to  phoebe's  place to do some major jammin with her drumset. that would be cool.
