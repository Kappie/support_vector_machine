Tomorrow's my only day off volunteering and I want to spend the day getting a few more of my site pages up. It feels like a load on my shoulders - I know it should be fun, and it is, but I just want it to be DONE already!! I want it to be all finished because I have this picture in my head and I know exactly how it's going to be and I want it in front of me. On top of that, I need to write at least 3 or 4 emails and do some research for upcoming trips to Seaside and Fiji. I know, I should stop babbling here and do it but this stuff is mindless.. it's about all my brain will produce right now.  If I was in better mental shape, I'd be launching in to some of my obsessions I am indulging right now but you'll have to make do with a list:  Ashlee Simpson, Nip/Tuck, North Shore  eBay.  Oh, and visit this site:  urlLink NotBush.com   I know it's not my country but I just hate to see colossal morons in charge of world super powers. Either way though, get out and VOTE! It's such a privilege and I hate to see so many Americans throw it away;  urlLink Choose or Lose .
