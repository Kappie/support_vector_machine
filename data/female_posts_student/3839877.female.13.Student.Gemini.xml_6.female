Downloaded a bunch of   Breaking Benjamin   songs, my new favorite band. xD Extremely bored, took a few more quizzes, quite proud of my results.  Went into   Hot Topic   to see if they had my   Foamy   dvd. They didn't. I'm seriously going to get those boots and that top. Wicked! xD I can't seem to find one of my favorite books,   Cut  . I think  Cheria  took it with her, she was reading it late last night. Though i'm not sure. Trying to   Adobe Photoshop CS   to work, no luck. -.- Still thirsting for  blood .  Watched a bit of tv,   Higher Ground  ,   Seriously Weird  ,   Weird Science  ,    The Tribe.  ect. ect  Went out to   Wal-Mart   for a bit, picked up another pack of   Pepsi Twist  . ^^ Did a bit more dreamweaving, fixed a few things on  ED . Killed my  parakeet . Nah, I wish. XD!  So bored...  12:30 AM Tired... I'm gunna go to bed in a bit. 'Night, night. x)
