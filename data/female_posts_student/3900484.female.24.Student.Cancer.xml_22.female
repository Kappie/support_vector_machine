I've been wondering when it was gonna happen, and not quite sure whether I should or shouldn't say something. Yay for the trials of friendship. I am currently worried about everything related to my career. I think I tend to space off about it, but I can't believe I only have 1 year, or more like 6 months to get my shit together. Then Im finally off. Far away. Scary. A little. Anyhoo, I suppose I'll start studying my standardized test crap soon, before I have to take it. So what did I do for my birthday? Had a Strawberry Margarita at lunch and then had a major shopping spree. Questionable timing, since I think I was still tipsy off of the liquor. Sad sad thing to get drunk off one drink when you are my age.
