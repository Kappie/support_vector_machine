I found out that someone I have liked for a long time (that crush) kinda likes me back.  That is soo much better than what I was expecting.  I was expecting to scare him and run him off.  Ohh well, it's a great thing I haven't, although I might before this is all over.  I am a freak... lol...  anyway, I still haven't burned anymore calories.  I beat up my little cousin, but I don't think that did anything.  I am going to be soo bored tomorow.  I am going to be here all day with no where to go and no one to see.  I hope I have a dream tonight, I haven't had one in a while.  I usually have freaky dreams anyway.  I don't want band camp to start, that means my summer is basically over... grr..  I have a question, how old is Bob Barker?  He has to be cryptic now.  He was old in the 70's, lol.  Well, I'm gonna go and hopefully live my life more interesting... Maybe I will post again later, Jami
