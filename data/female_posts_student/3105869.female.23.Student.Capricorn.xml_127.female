I am keenly aware of the little (or sometimes mammoth suckers) as a I have an aversion to cold blooded creatures in general. I think this dates back to the Frog Prince story and the childhood horror induced from 5 yr old thoughts of having to kiss one. As such, when I see one to this day I feel a sudden need to jump the closest fence, bus stop, street lamp, etc. Well, its been rainy and there is a river nearby and everything is green, but there are no frogs? Or there is a conspiracy to wait and jump me in mass when I'm struttin' 4 inch heels.     Movingright along. Went to Salzburg today. Rained. Big surprise. Did theSound ofMusic Tour and felt at ease and happy. It was sooooo great. They expect you to be cheesy and evenencourage it. However, theygave us the real story of the VonTrapps and smashed myhappy little fairytale bubble. But they compensated by playing themusic the wholetime on the bus. Beautiful. We stopped for a tobogan ride and I declined as my fear of heights is second only to my fearofcold blooded, reptilian icky things. I watched from the bottom and madefriends with a couple from Kuwait. Itold the wife that mymother would kill me if she saw me shoot down luge going a gazillion miles an hour with noseatbelt. She hugged me, squeezed my hand, and said "I'll be your mother on the tour." They even asked forpictures with me, so in keepingwith the general congeniality with my new-found-surrogate parents, I asked for pics with them too. I was glad I madefriends with them. When we had firstgotten on the bus, the tour guide [typical] asked where I am from, I told him the U.S., that wasn't enough for him, so I said Texas. I realized from the initial look on their faces thatthey didn't dislike Texans, but they well somehow unsure of sharing a bus row with me. So I started mission improbable to proveI was affable. Apparently I was a success, they walked me to the train station when it was all over. cool. So, the other adoptedfriends Imade were a group of Aussies, amiable type ofpeople as usual, and it was funny cuz leaving the tour we all said goodbye. I went up to my platform to wait a good thirty minutes and Ithought I was hallucinating, I could heartheirvoices. Anyway they were on my train. But in the scramble to get aboard, we were separated again and I thought I would suffer the ride alone. SoI sat and was busting out my MP3 player when whose voice boomed over the dull roar, but the Aussies. So anyway we talked all the way to Worgl when they got off, but when they did they did a very touching andnot typical thing for a non-Euro....theyboth leaned down to hug and gimme a kiss on the cheek. Then theykept turning around and waving goodbye from the exit of the train and after they got off, until their heads disappeared descending the stairs. I dunno why, maybe from hunger exhaustion and cold rain, but it was touching. The whole day turned out to be sweet.     Then I got back into Innsbruck and waitedfor the stupid bus, which skid and almost took out another bus, thatsone hell of a way to board a bus, immediately post-almost-accident. Then the Austrian comfortfood I sought in my exhaustion was closed, and I realized I would be doomed to order pizza. Apparently somebody forgot to give Innsbruck the memo that its Saturday!! So I descended the bus a stop early in hopes of find some yummy filling Austrian food, which functions likeLondon pubfood in cold rain. And one light was on...Gasthaus Prugger...but I remembered I looked bedraggled, no make-up, I'd been rained on since early that morning. I went in even though its also a very nice restaurant, at this point I would have bought anything I was so starved forfood I was getting dizzy, thanks to tour-rambo-Rachel's melee approach to visiting Salzburg. It was so good. Sleepy now. So long, farewell...
