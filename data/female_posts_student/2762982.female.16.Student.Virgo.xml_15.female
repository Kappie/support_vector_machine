So, thought I would get together with Myles again today...but ended up making it a group thing...sorta...  Kat and I decided some things need to be said, so we went to a movie and talked with Myles...wasn't very productive other then me learning somethings.  Yeah...I would've really rather spent all that time with us him...but oh well >.
