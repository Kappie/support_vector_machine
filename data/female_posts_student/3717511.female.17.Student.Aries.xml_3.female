"If you swallow a seed, you'll grow a watermelon inside you!" or,if by chance you're talking to a girl,"Dont swallow the black ones, or your first baby will be a watermelon!" WHAT IF the latter actually happened to some poor woman? I know, I know, it's not possible. But, WHAT IF...   I would imagine that giving birth to a watermelon would be exceptionally painful given its size--MUCH larger than your average baby. Perhaps the watermelon baby would be somewhat like a living human, but composed of plant matter--little vines for its arms and legs, a large melon for the torso and another slightly smaller one which  would function as the head. I suppose that the babies, being made of perishable fruit, would begin to go bad after a few months. As they would begin to rot their normal sweet dispositions would change to crankiness and displays of rebellion, and I guess they would also smell very unpleasant. (Normal human babies go bad at two years.) NOW, since these babies are fruits,and live such short little lives--with violent ends...would it really be so bad to eat them? I think this would be all the rage among Ethiopians and other starving peoples. Instant food! No land ownership required to farm.
