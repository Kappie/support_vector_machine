The solo in the third movement was sung by this choir boy who was blind - he was absolutely amazing.  Can you imagine how scary it must be to stand up infront of a huge audience and sing on your own when you can't even SEE them?!!  Was a bit annoyed with my friend though because we were supposed to meet at 5:30 in order to go for coffee beforehand and catch up, but she was late because she got talking to someone else and so didn't arrive until 6:10 and the thing started at 6:15. Anyway.....  Ok this morning I went to visit this Therapeutic Community.  For any of you who don't know what a therapeutic community is go to  urlLink www.therapeuticcommunities.org/faq.htm . But basically it is a place where people with certain mental health probs go for a year to apparently 'get sorted'.  I don't want to go because I feel like although life is quite tough, I AM coping.  But I went to have a look around anyway.  I am SO glad that I asked Debs to come with me, because it was SO scary. We got there and waited in the waiting room and 2 people came in and said can we ask you some questions. Sure no problems.  So they asked me if I had consumed any alcohol that morning, taken any drugs, or had any impending court cases? Well hello nice to meet you too.  After obviously replying no to all 3, we were taken into this huge room where 12 other people were sat in a big circle.  We had to sit down and then everyone went round introducing themselves.  About 3 were staff and 10 residents.  EVERYONE was watching me. I wanted to curl up and hide.  Then we watched this 30min video about what the therapeutic community is and how it works.  during this time another prospective guy came in, so at least there were 2 of us now.  Then we had like a question time.  And although there are lots of things that sound quite good about the place, some stuff is REALLY wierd.  Like if you have a problem at anytime of day or night, you have to approach one of the resident reps who are on duty and they then call a house meeting which all staff and residents have to attend (even in the middle of the night!), to sort it out.  So like I would tell someone if I had a problem!!  Anyway I really don't think I want to go there. But I have asked Debs to think about it and give an objective opinion.  It has been really lovely and warm here today. I even walked out earlier in just a t-shirt. Feels like summer is on its way - yipee!
