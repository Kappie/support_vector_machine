I was downloading anime episodes, so I kept the computer on all through the night. I was only able to get back to the computer at about 3:00 p.m today, and it turns out this guy was messaging me throughout the whole night. Apparently he wanted to download one of the songs on the computer, but kept on getting disconnected. n_n;; Poor guy. He wanted the song so badly he messaged me about 15 times. But then again, he got pissed off with me [duh! How the heck am I supposed to reply?] and told me that he had already downloaded the song off of someone else, saying that I was an 'ignorant bastard', and that I should go do a bear. n_n;;; MEN!    I'm currently looking up the anime,  Wolf's Rain.  I've been hearing that it's really good, so I've decided to look it up myself. From what I've read and found, I've been convinced to actually start downloading it on WinMX. n_n;; With that, I just have to say that I love  Google.  I usually find everything there. n_n What?? You thought I was going to say someone's name?? Heh! You wish! XD
