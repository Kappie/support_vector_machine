He works there despite the fact that he knows that most of the time his boss isnt up for any good. All these, well..because he has no choice and he enjoys cooking those crabby patties.   Spongebob has an egoistic colleague who acts as if he owns the place. Although Spongebob is the one who cooks the food that makes the diner successful, he treats Spongebob like shit. Talk about being insecure.  Spongebob has a stupid friend starfish who he has to deal with every single day. Spongebob has to endure idiocy at its best and still keep his sanity.   These are the things that every person, at any point in their screwed up lives, experience. This is reality personified in a cartoon.   And yeah, when u get stranded in an island, u dont get followed by a camera and u try to help the other people who are stranded too to survive. Because ur human, and that is just how it goes...how real life goes.
