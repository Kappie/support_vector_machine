I have a hat, Josh, that you would enjoy, I think, quite a bit.  It's a duck.  With glasses.  I named it Zoolof.  And today has been fairly good. No evil people trying to kill me...yet.  But we do have people (the Batsons, Linds...wahoo), that I don't really enjoy.  Oh well...maybe I can go out to dinner with my sis or something.   Well, I'm off to Florida-land.  I'm kinda annoyed because Kyndall checked the weather, and it's supposed to rain the ENTIRE time I will be there.  Which kinda defeats the purpose of a beach retreat.  I'm almost done packing....just the stuff for the 10-hour bus ride left.  This is going to be interesting.  TJ and Scott aren't riding in the bus and they are the two people who will actually make it fun.  I actually have to be social.  YUCK!!!!  I will talk to you guys again, I guess on Friday/Saturday...depends on when I get back.    Don't forget.  Satuday, Baskin Robins, Noon.
