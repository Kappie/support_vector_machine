I was also able to call AJ, Stretch and my mother for awhile as well. It's always great  to hear familar voices on the other end of the telephone line.  Okay, I have 8 miutes before I have to head to the Captain's office.  Just got off the phone with him. The greek's answer their phone with a "nayyy" word which means, "Yes?" Kinda rude if you ask me but I just go with the flow.  My conversation is always the same with the Captain but we have this routiene and if I broke it the conversation wouldn't be right.  "Good evening Captain, this is your social hostess, Shelly."   "Ella, Shelly." "Yes, Sir, I have your tables ready for review." "Endaxi, 6:30pm" "Okay, bye." CLICK.  Everytime, the same conversation. It's funny. We have a lot of younger people on board this cruise. That's exciting - rather than same 70 years plus.  No offense to our elders but jeez, remind me not to be so cranky when I get older.   There was beautiful sunset out of San Diego tonight. It was - yes - cold in San Diego. The temp was about 58-60 degrees. (Much different from Acapulco a few days ago). None the less, the change in temperature was welcomed since we have been in 80-90's for the past 8 days. I can't iamgine what Alaska will be like.   Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.    99 days to go. Cali Nickta.  (Good night)
