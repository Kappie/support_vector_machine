       
      Got a sad letter from a friend last night.  She fought breast cancer 5-6 years ago and won the battle, and she found out in January that the cancer is back.  It has spread to her liver and upper arm, and has affected her spine, skull, pelvis and rib cage.  Cancer is so awful.  It has taken too many lives already.  I don't want her to be another statistic.  She is undergoing chemo and indicates that she lives in Hope.  For her sake, I will too.  More to come...
