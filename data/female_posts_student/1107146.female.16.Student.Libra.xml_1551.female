Last night I entirely pwned EVERYONE, which has never happened before because I really suck at it. But I finished 90-37, everyone else was negative. HAR HAR HAR. Ok enough loser video game kid talk...altho more on my BLog, for those who care, heheheh.  We (my friends and I) play CS on and off...like, we'll play for a solid month or so, and then one of us will drop out, and then another, and eventually we'll stop, and then we'll start again. It's start again time, except I've become a god somehow, which is great because it definitely deflates their overly-blown heads...tho why they get such joy in repeatedly killing a n00ber that doesn't even move when the round starts is beyond me.   But whatever, how are all the BLog peeps doin'?
