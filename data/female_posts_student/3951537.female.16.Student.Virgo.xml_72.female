I am alone in a massive building with an iPod and a kickass stereo system, not to mention the internet, and...  Pride and Prejudice .  So okay, I'm not as happy about the last one.  By the way, for those of you who care or maybe, somehow, find it in you to sympathize with me and my pain, I finally finished  The Unbearable Lightness of Being.   I'd like to share something.  As many times as I get told what a great book ULoB is, I still can't quite feel that sentiment myself.  Partly because I'm reading it for school, but mostly because I... don't like it.  You know, most people would assume that since I'm here, all by my lonesome, I'd be thrilled.  No.  I'm not.  I'd feel far more reassured if there were people here.  I feel like there's some impending nuclear disaster everyone but me knows about.  The Club is NEVER empty.  Okay, so we've only been open 10 minutes.  I don't care.  Note to all you people out there: it is entirely possible to drive with an inflatable swimming pool in the back of your car.  Visibility isn't great, sure, but look: Emily and I didn't die in a car accident last night.  In all actuality, Emily and I died at the park.  Ah, I believe people have showed up.  How interesting.  Granted, they're not in the door, so there's still that vague possibility thst I'm hallucinating, so don't get your collective hopes up yet for me.  Yes, I know you're hoping for people to come, so I don't perish of loneliness and paranoia.  The boredom won't go away until after this shift is over, so don't bother hoping for that one.  This paragraph is ending now because it's become a monster of unclear wording.  Yes, people showed up.  Apocalypse diverted.  For now.  Still, no one else who works here has showed up.  I like it when this happens.  It's quiet and I can play my own music.  All right.  PP time.
