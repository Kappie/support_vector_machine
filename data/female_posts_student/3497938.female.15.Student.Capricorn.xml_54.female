We stayed up talkin and playin with Katelyn. Then Tuesday I came back home and we went to Tanger Outlet Mall. Then Danielle came over to spend the night *shes here now* and we stayed up until 5 or 6 and then got up at 12. *lol* Today we are just gonna chill here. We might go to church. But I dont know if I wanna go. *shame on me* But, Oh well. Tomorrow I wanna go shopping. Friday I should be going to my mom's house to help with the yard sale. ThenSaturday I am going to drive to Atlanta with Ted. *not fun, not looking forward to it* So, I should keep pretty busy. I might post in between. Who knows...
