Legend  how does it make you feel   I am feeling very warm right now Please don't disappear I am spacing out with you You are the most beautiful entity that i've ever Dreamed of  At night i will protect you in your dreams I will be your angel You worry so much about not having enough time Together It makes no difference to me I would be happy with just one minute in your arms Let's have an extended play together You're telling me that we live too far to love each Other But your love can stretch further than you and i Can see So how does it make you feel?  How does it make you feel? How does it make you feel? How does it make you feel? How does it make you feel?  Do you know when you look at me It is a salvation I've been waiting for you so long I can drive on that road forever I wish you could exist to live on my planet Well it's very hard for me to say these things in Your presence So how does it make you feel?  How does it make you feel? How does it make you feel? How does it make you feel? How does it make you feel?  So how does it make you feel? Well,i really think you should quit smoking
