For starters, I am getting tired of my responsibility to all of you who have nothing better to do than read my blog.  I feel obligated to keep this site up now.  But not to worry, deep down I do enjoy talking about nothing and knowing people really care.  I guess I'll use this analogy to explain:  It's like the first summer my brother and I discovered the computer game The Sims.  We loved it so much that we played it every day.  Okay, we were a little bit addicted.  Then there was a period in time where we found ourselves worn out from the same-old same-old.  But soon later we loved it again and played it a lot.  Kind of like blogging, eh?  Here's what I'm excited about:  This weekend Vaci (aka Veronika aka Bobby's girlfriend) is graduating from Santa Clara University this Saturday morning.  The only thing I'm not excited about is that the ceremony starts at 8:30am...and we have to get there early for parking, seating, etc.  But the post-lunch party is at La Paloma, the BEST Mexican restaurant EVER!  Hooray!  They have the most delicious beans IN THE WORLD!    Anyways, I promise to update more frequently...maybe after the graduation...and the BEANS!
