Not even someone to understand, just someone who might feign interest for five minutes or so while I say whatever comes to mind or mouth. It seems to me like I have done a lot of talking without thinking lately, and I'm starting to wonder if some people are starting to think I'm an idiot because of it. Oh well, just one more thing people think that I already know.  I'm lonely. I really wish I had someone to talk to right now. Someone to lie to me. To make me believe that things will be ok again. That is, of course, how I know they're lying. Home Coming is coming up soon. I'll probably end up going with friends again. That's how it goes.  I'm lonely. I really wish I had a hug right now.
