       
      I got called into work tonight, and my, it was nonstop action. Chicken was big-- yeah, obviously it is a Sunday night and people don't want to cook dinner. And God, I got bitched at tonight more than I do at home, which is a mild wonder, mind you. But hey, 6 and a half hours at $5.50 a pop--- whew! Am I racking in the dough!   Okay, Okay! In complete honesty, my day was actually kind of nice. And I feel completely insecure about that fact, as much as my last two statements diabolically opposed each other. I feel good, but I am afraid that because I feel so good, the only way that I can go is down. Something will happen that will hurt me; someone will say or do something that will allow what I have allowed myself to feel tragically come crashing down. I need to stop, I know I do, but I can't help myself.
