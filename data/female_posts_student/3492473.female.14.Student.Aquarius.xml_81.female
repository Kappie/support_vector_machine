So I went to bed and  just cried  for awhile. It started raining so I just listened to that and eventually I fell asleep. I woke up around 11:30, just as Eddie was leaving to go to my grandpa's to paint. It felt good to get to sleep in for once. And to get 10 hours of sleep. During school I'm lucky if I get seven. So I went to eat breakfast and then after I just went online for an hour or so. I talked to Gretchen so that made me happy. She's still in Mexico. She comes back Friday. It's quite depressing. She's been going out with her boyfriend for 9 months now. I mean, come on,  why don't I have a boyfriend?  Being single has been good for me and I enjoy being able to do whatever the hell I wanna but  it's still lonely.  Later I read some Tom Sawyer then and I finished the CosmoGIRL I've had for like a week. I always read my Cosmo's like the day I get them but since I've had to read Tom, I had to take a break from CG. Then I read some more Tom Sawyer and went online.  I just don't know anymore.  People are just so confusing. Like I don't know what's going on anymore. And I'm ready to scream. It's just so frustrating. Especially how people say crap to me thinking they're being sweet but they really have no idea what's going on.  Hell, I don't even know.  So don't say things that are just gonna make me sigh and be like, " I wish ..." I planned on staying in my PJ's til I left for soccer and I'm proud to say it happened. Ha ha. I was comfy, so I didn't wanna change. Eddie told me his friend Greg was coming over to mess around with his car so I was like, "Alright, just stay outside. I'm not changing and I look like shit." Well, actually, I looked cute in a way! And I even had to go outside a few times so yeah. Greg's kinda cute! :) It was five and I realized I hadn't even been drinking water and I still had to ice my foot and everything. See, I try to drink at least three glasses of water everyday before practice. So I started to freak out. I don't know, just a billion things were happening at once. I was trying to carry on convos with certain people but it wasn't working out. I was trying to get some info out of one person but that wasn't working out either. But I did find out my cousin Chris is coming up this Friday for the day and part of Saturday. So that made me happy! He was suppose to come up last weekend but his plans changed so he didn't. I'm guessing we're gonna hang out Friday night so yay! And I get to Matt so that's all good! Maybe I'll see my dad?  Hopefully.  So I went to change into my soccer clothes and since Eddie and Greg were both outside, I walked out of my room in just my sports bra (which isn't a big deal in the first place,  it's not like the damn thing is skimpy ) and I ran into Eddie. And I was like, "Whoa!" Just because he scared me. I didn't expect to run into him. And he's like, "God. You know I'm home so just put a shirt on." He thought I was whoa-ing because I was in a sports bra. Whatever. I used to take baths with the boy. And plus, he's my bro, so too bad. So then I went to soccer. Soccer was the same. Me yelling at people, my foot hurting like a bitch, but today I was ready to kill Donny. Ok, I can't sprint at full speed because of my foot. Even the coach knows that. I'm not gonna push myself at practice and just hurt it more. If I need to sprint full speed at tomorrow's scrimmage then I will. It's totally different then. But Donny just kept yelling at me because I wasn't going full sprint and all this bull shit. And I told him about my foot but he just said some crap and I'm like, "Screw it. Say what you wanna, but I'm not gonna do it. I know when to push myself and when not to." Geez. Then I had to go to Giant Eagle w/ my mom and Eddie. I saw some of the guys there so I waved.  I looked like a dork  in my cleats and shin guards and my hair was a mess. Oh well. Mark was the only hot one there. And I don't even like him so it's not like it matters. Nicole and I were talking about the hot people on the soccer team and what not today at practice. It was quite funny. I was limping all through the store. My foot hurt so bad. I started to feel sick too because I hadn't ate in 6 hours so I was happy to get home and eat some pizza. I filled a bucket with ice and water and have been icing both my feet all night. I'm nervous for tomorrow.  Tomorrow is my first high school soccer scrimmage ever!  Go figure. I don't know what to expect.  I just wanna prove myself . I don't wanna go and screw up and have everyone think that I suck. I just wanna play good. All of you should come and cheer the team on!! So I've just been chilling all night. No one called me or anything. But I don't really care. I wouldn't have wanted to do anything anyways. I'm thinking about going to bed really soon too. Mr. Willis told us to get a good night's sleep so yeah. I have to be at the school by 4:15ish.  So for all you losers who don't go , I'll tell you all the wonderful details tomorrow. I really wanna talk to someone though. So I'm waiting to see if they come online. I don't wanna call them at midnight just to discuss crap. I wanted to paint my nails but I'm too lazy. I found out my "grandma's" (Rosie) husband (George) is pretty much helpless. Like the doctors can't do anything to him so it's just a matter of time til he dies. At least my mom put it that way. God, that's gonna hard. Especially for Rose. Ah, why do people have to die? I'm kinda mad at Margaret too. Like lately, I've been telling her stuff about what's been going on with me  and she doesn't really care.  Which is weird for her. I don't know. She's in some weird phase. But it annoys me because I can't really talk to her now and I can  never  talk to my mom. My God, I was on the phone w/ Tina today and I was in the kitchen and my mom was in there too. I started talking about this one person and my mom's like, "Tell Kristina to hold on. Now who is this person?" She's so nosy and she expects me to tell her shit. Ha. Like that's gonna happen. I don't like telling her crap.  She can never be happy for me.  She always has something  bad  to say about what I tell her. So I just try to avoid these types of conversations altogether. That doesn't mean I don't wish I could talk to her. Because I  really  wish I could. I guess I was just always closer to my dad.  I don't wanna think about this now but whatever.  It really upsets me how he's been gone for most of my life.  I never understood why he didn't call or write a letter or anything. He had our number and he knew where we lived. And if he forgot, my cousins all knew.  It just sucks for me because Eddie's been the father figure for me all my life.  I just wish I had  my dad as the father figure  and Eddie as the older brother figure. It sucks because  what does my dad really know about me?  I don't even know. It just pisses me off because I think if given the time and all that, I could tell my dad everything. And I could ask him for advice and all that.  I think the two of us have a connection  that would allow that. And it still gets me how my dad has never seen me play soccer, seen me at a track meet or at a basketball game. It's just I hardly get through the pain, how can he go through that pain multiplied by three? (meaning my sis and bro) I'm not sure if this is okay to say but I'll say it anyways.  I think he missed me the most.  I mean Margaret lived with him til she was 18 and Eddie saw him a lot more than me. Part of me is still my daddy's little girl. I don't care how much I've grown up.  I wanna be that little girl again.  And the stupidest thing is I can hardly write about this. I mean I have a few poems about my dad but nothing I could ever give him.  They're all so mean.  And they blame him for everything that went wrong in my life. Granted, he was the main reason of it all. It's just hard to look around at these daughters and fathers and see them all so happy. I dunno when I'll be able to get over this all. I get in these stages where I care so much for awhile and then I just get depressed and don't even bother. Although it's really hard to not care. I mean I have this guys blood. I look just like him. I mean without him, I wouldn't be here. But then I think about when I saw him.  And I think about that hug.  And it's those kind of feelings  that keep me holding on.   I'm so happy around him.  And all of this seems to brings me to tear  every single  time. My family is so screwed up. I mean seriously. And I'm a perfectionist. (How did I become one anyways?) I don't know how anything fits together. But I'm hoping as I get older, all the pieces will just fall into place...Well, I'm out. Night night. I'm just pissed because I still need to talk to someone. Whatever.  I'm used to people letting me down...    HAPPY 13TH BIRTHDAY TO JENNY!! LOVE YA BABE AND MISS YOU SOO MUCH!
