It feels like theres a brick on my chest...I miss him soooo much. *sigh* Its just seemed like forever since I've seen him and it'll probably still be another few weeks...I noticed it more today than any other day how much everything around me reminds me of him. A car...driving by my house made me hold my breath for just a sec today. Theres always that hope of him being there...*sigh* Everywhere I look...there he is. I opened a book today...first thing I saw was Ross. *sigh* Im going crazy aren't I. Even tho he rarely calls me...everytime the phone rings...I once again hold my breath. Eh. I guess I did get myself into this...I was so bored tonight since no one was really on...well atleast no one of interest to talk to..so I started seaching the internet on Humboldt n stuff cuz hey I have no life...and I guess it just hit me. Yeah I know...im stupid but yeah...I just -really- miss him. *sigh*  But otherwise some stuff is good today. I might be on Varsity! :D Because someone complained about 6 on a sqaud so they changed to 8 and that leaves Jen and I as alternates and then 2 chicks might quit cuz they really don't like Duncan and don't get along with her to well so that puts Jen and I right in there. Wow. I never thought I'd ever make it...since I barely accomplish anything but yeah. It would be awesome if I did. I'd get to skip band! woo! lol goodbye marching band! :D lol so yeah if I do it'll just be great fun. We play Fort Dodge this year...odd since we like never have or w/e I think its some Christian school or something *shrug* Hell if I know. But yeah...its close to Humboldt :D. See there I go again...everything...reminds me...  Another good thing bout today is that my Grandpa is doing a whole lot better. But they did find a cancer spot on his kidney so they might just take it out..but hes not cold anymore which is really good...he was scaring us for awhile. So yeah...lots of good news n stuff...except well Im probably gonna end up doin bad in Algebra. I've just been slacking off to much...and yeah...it shows...ive gone down quite a bit but everyother class is an A so it'll all even out. Well I guess I have nothing else to ramble about...  Tara...
