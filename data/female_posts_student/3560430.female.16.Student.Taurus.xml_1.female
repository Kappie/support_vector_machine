This is sad and crazy I'm mourning the loss of a Bethie for ten days in which time I need to collect money and make serious party plans. This isn't cool. Well I'll figure it out:)   I find that my writing on this blog is much more disconjointed then my actual writing is. Puntuation in funny places, really no focus, well what ever, there is interesting attitude!   Got my marks today! They are better than normal, 98% accross the board in English 10/11 Honours. It's a beautiful life when that happens. Speaking of school (and I don't know why I am) Comparative Civilizations will be so cool! Expecially with Bethie in my class! Our parties are great but I think that our conjoined projects will be better! Trust me that's saying something.   Until July 14 I officialy have nothing to do. This means some serious vegitation time! I'm talking movies writing and a whole lot of reading! I'm thinking of catching up on some of the classics once I'm done with my re-read of Outlander. I'll do a classic and then read Dragonfly in Amber, or I'll read Draginfly in Amber and then a classic... Ooh this could be dangerous. I'll end up reading complete fluff all summer and maybe get in one classic near the end. I shoudl try and read one on my way to Calgary, that might be an idea.  Now to move on without any transitions what so ever... Oh never mind, let's go back to report cards. I also got my annual as well, lots of people signed it was great! So many of my friends have gotten hair cuts and that kind of bothers me as I completely believe that people should stay the same unless I say they may change. It's kind of a gradual thing with me. Some people  say I'm obsessive compulsive, others say that I'm just quirky. I say I'm wierd. That's just me. I also have a problem when people walk on the wrong side of me or when certain objects aren't perfectly simetrical. There's also the problem I have with colours. If specific colours don't coinside with other colours then I kind of go a little bit nuts. Of course they have to work in accordance with the structure and clolours they are with. Alright so I'm a bit odd. All I'm saying is that another one of my "things" is when people change before my mind is prepared. These were ok though, everyone's hair is beautiful.   Well due to the fact that I'm a trekki. Bethany shut up! I'm being called away by the computer to watch Voyager. This is the episode where harry thinks he's an alien. It's kind of sad but I really really really like it. I think it's genetic.
