What's even scarier than that is the fact that I'm not even all that worried right now. I mean, by all means, I should be scared out of my wits right now, but I'm not. And I don't know why. I mean, today, when Mrs. Kean (Valliere now) told us that nobody in her previous honors class yesterday has gotten above a 90 for the timed writing, I wasn't even a bit worried.  Maybe I'm getting a big head.  It must be Gabriel and all the classes (four! FOUR!) that I have with him.  Precal was beyond funny today. =D  beD XTC: and all your little gilry friends are there, too  hahahahaha. talking about the A day lunch. I found it funny. =)  9 more pages of WHAP to read, then take notes, then chem, then memorize, then precal. Aaah!  I'm glad I'm back at school. I've missed it. The pressure, the stress, the competition, the procrastination, that sense of triumph you get when you realize you got the highest grade in the entire tenth grade class, the sense of triumph you get when you beat someone you espeically hate, and most of all, getting a good grade for a bsed project.  Ah, high school. There's nothing else quite like it.
