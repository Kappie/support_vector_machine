White walls and instead of 4 walls there were 3 walls and one was a giant window there was a white couch and in a corner there was a tall white vase with white Lilly were no lights or fans. The room was very peaceful looking. I turned around and took off my shoes. I stepped in again. I headed towards the couch and looked in a mirror on the wall over the couch to make sure my back side was clean and I sat down. In another vase there was bamboo. It wasn't as tough you would get in trouble for getting it dirty but it was too beautiful to do so. It isn't cheerful but not sad either it was releasing and relaxing. It would be the perfect place for writing or art. It was the most plesant place i had ever been.
