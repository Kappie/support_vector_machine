Deep-rooted friendships will continue while others will drift apart.  Also, I think that some of us will end up going to the same colleges (I mean besides Maggie, who else really wants to leave California?)  I don't!  We'll all probably see eachother once in a while, until one day we won't even remember each other.  Laura won't remember Maggie's last name and Jessie won't remember why she was banned from Jason's car and we'll all go on with our lives.  It is a little depressing, but getting older means moving on...  right?
