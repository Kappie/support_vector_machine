Hossler is gonna be public affairs with me! actually she is above me but it will be fun!!! and i dont think she likes amy either! but i still have no clue if i'm an officer or an NCO. i kinda want to be an officer but if i dont get it i dont think i would care that much cuz i love taking pictures and i would rather take pictures than be an officer!!!  Oh and Jared's flight won the drill comp!!!!! Congrats Jared!!!  oh and miree is not the only person who reads this!! Jared does too, he just doesnt write comments!!!  please write me some comments baby, i dont care what they say just write me one! and that goes for everybody else too,if there is anybody else!!!
