I finally got his number and gave him a call today, but he's working right now...Maybe we'll do something later on tonight. Inever did anything with Ryan because of work, but I'm not sure ifI want to anymore, I mean I barely know him and I don't know how fun he is or whatever. I know with Nick I'll have fun though (he's so hilarious!). The one thing I like abouthim is that he smells really good...haha. Yeah I hate it when guyspractically pour their cologne all over their bodies, and then the scent just overwhelmsyou so much that you can't even think, and you'rechoking and gasping fora breath of fresh air....Well, that's notNick's case. He wearsjust the right amount and it smells really really good.He's sotallthough. I am already short,but he honestlyhas to be like a foot taller than I am. Well, it'll be interesting to see how all this turns out. He seems like a really nice guy though...Just hope that I don't get tired of him...Which I doubt!
