Drats! Oh, well there will be more. Anyway MOHAA is the most fun online. So many people to kill, almost too many... Maybe not. By the way the comics that i was drawing up will hopefully be up by the end of the week. It all depends on who has a a better scanner, and can get the copies to me the fastest. Peace out x))
