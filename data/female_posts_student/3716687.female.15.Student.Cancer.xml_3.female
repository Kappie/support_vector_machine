Several weeks ago we found out my grandmother was diagnosed with malignant melenoma in her liver. How she could have skin cancer in her liver, I don't know. But, she starts treatments for it today, and on Friday my mother, siblings and I will go down there to take care of her for about a week and some odd days.       Back about 3 weeks ago my mother had a physical, and the doctor's are concerned that she may have colon cancer. So she will be having a colonoscopy done right after we come back from North Carolina.       My birthday was last week, and so was missions. The morning we left for the trip, we pull into the Calvin parking lot, and I see a van that looked familiar, but not familiar from the church, I figured that it was some poor homeless family sleeping in their car, since we have several who do so in the parking lot.      We pull up to the front of the church and the van follows us around. All of a sudden I hear my brother and sister scream LOOK! IT'S MICHAEL!      Needless to say, he was there to surprise me for my birthday with a rose and my gift. I just couldn't believe it. But then again, I can almost never believe anything he does. What a wonderful guy.      On missions we worked for a man named Mr. Burns. He was a retired baptist minister who had fallen deeply into poverty, and we were there to repair his house. Honestly, it would have been better to burn the house down and start from scratch. But, we couldn't afford to do that. We worked until thursday, and came home on Friday.       Saturday I went out to breakfast with my family, went to Barnes and Nobles where I bought the Lovely Bones (my favorite book) and to 17th street surf shop. We came home and I went to the movies with Caitlin and Ross. We saw King Arthur which I must say was pretty good.      Yesterday was church where I saw Michael the last time for 3 weeks, but I do say I thouroughly enjoyed his father's sermon. I knew that he'd start writing sermon's about me the second time I went there....      Well, I'm off to take a shower and go on with my day. I've missed all of you terribly, send me an e-mail sometime this week or give me a call if you want to do something when I get back.      I love you all      Allison
