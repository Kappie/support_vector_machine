Sensationalism aside,[NZ] does seem pretty ‘staid’ in comparison with the crowd and colour of Western China. I did also have some quieter moments living in a small Tibetan village in Jiuzhaigou National Park, and had plenty of time for research despite threats of being deported by the police over visa troubles.   I might as well make a public confession now, that I spent just as much time working with the local villagers in their day jobs hiring out their colourful national dress to Chinese tourists as I did doing ‘real research’. However, this put me in good stead for later times of question-asking, and gave me something to do during those “what the hell am I doing here?” times that every honest researcher appears to go through! Basically, the job involved me (in my limited Mandarin Chinese) convincing tourists to rent out the clothing in any way possible – the most effective being trying to convince them that I was a local Tibetan who was born with unnaturally blonde hair and a rather big nose, and promising to take a photo with them if they rented their clothes from me. Of course, all the proceeds of this little adventure went back into the communal funds to be shared out among the villagers at the end of the day, so the locals were exceedingly happy to host me.   [Kai Li]has just returned from her fieldwork for her thesis “Examining the potential of mass tourism in the facilitation of community development: A case study of Jiu Zhai Gou National Park, Sichuan, China.”
