If it’s a fight you want, It’s a fight you’ll get Because you’ve made us mad And we want you to suffer by our hand You caused others injuries To cover up your insecurities On us, you look down As if you’re wearing a crown Who are you to give us our place? Who are you to choose our fate? You will never be our fear. Challenge us and you will die by a spear.
