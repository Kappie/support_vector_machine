They leave me broken hands, those diamonds from the coal.   They lace me along,  Giving synapse of white lines.  Then chasing the dawn,  Story book syntax.   Your eyes slit the throat, of all I know.  About myself and this life.  Silhouette lies.   And your eyes, speaking in tongues.  Vigilant still, filling my lungs.  Testing my will.  They leave me broken and, bruised and bleeding.   Your eyes, resting in flame,  Leaven me breathless again.  Like hydrogen spread on fault lines.  Or dead, kissing me with exposure to radon.   Your eyes slit the throat, of all I know.  About myself and this life.  Silhouette lies.   Your eyes, Your eyes.  Speaking in tongues.  Vigilant still, lead our way.  Filling my lungs.  Testing my will.   You slit the throat, of I know.  About myself and this life.  Silhouette Lies.   You slit my throat.  Because I know,  That this life, is a lie.  So slit my throat.
