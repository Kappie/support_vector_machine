(sure we did three weddings that period, one was with people who volunteered BECKY SMITH AND MATT GREENBLATT, eeewwww) yeah so anyway, she picked me because she said i was "avoiding looking at her" which i suppose it true but not quite. I always avoid looking at her. stupid cow. i mean.... no. that's right. yeah, have decided to hate breslin. So she's like "yay fuck you allie" and i married shane carlson. admittedly, could have been worse. And cheryl and hannah wrapped my sari a SMIDGE too tight. yeah. that hurt. It was really funny though because at the part where i had to feed him the rice i was just like "fick this, EAT IT YOURSELF" only less dramatic. I just like handed him the container and the fork, and was like "EAT IT" everyone laughed. Good times. no scratch that. Meh times. Or perhaps embarressing times. That kinda works. p.s. i want a sari, those things are amazing. But at least she didn't take pictures like Mr. Nolen did. BAHA MADELINE. p.p.s. if anyone wants to see Madeline's wedding check out Mr. Nolens room. It's the first room on the right in A-wing (BAHA MADELINE...again.)
