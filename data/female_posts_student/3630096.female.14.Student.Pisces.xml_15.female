The time was ticking away...which means my most worried fear is going to be here once more, the napha test. *gulp* I had no idea whether I can pass or not. I've been failing for years...not even passing once. My biggest problems are the standing board jump and the incline pull up. Somehow...I couldn't jump far and my hand had no strength to pull myself up. My brother couldn't pass his napha either. and it's national service to him... good luck, brother. =).  Satruday of course also means band practice. And the tutors are coming. And shiting with yina were not here... That means. I'm left with regina! *OMG* She's quite all right actually...confused between sharps and flats, fingerings, and her reaction is not fast enough.  Enough about regina...now about myself! I'm able to go through shenadoah more clearly now that there is less people, I cannot fret! Somehow, the feeling is lost. A feeling which I felt when the pressure which the seniors exerted on you. When I'm still with Jaslyn, the feeling is never gone. I can never be on task. I always depend on her. And when both of us dunno, I felt myself blushing. But now, I'm on task. I came in at the right beat. Everything is going on fine. Life is a lot more better than last time. (With the exception of regina's problem) Another problem is that the whole green file had gone missing. SIGH. I really felt like bashing up the person that had taken it away! That's  SO RUDE !!!The fingering chart is gone! REALLY! Gee... I only hope that the file can be in the cabinet by next friday...That's all I wished. That's all I wanted. Can't a simple wish be granted? I just want everything to be fine. But life is never going to be like that. Life is never smooth sailing... Human always wanted what they don't have. It's a nature. It's rare that once in a while, people get to appreciate things...
