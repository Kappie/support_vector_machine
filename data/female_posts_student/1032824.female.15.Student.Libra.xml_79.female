Anyways, i'm really anxious about tomorrow's campcraft selection. i'm not afraid of  not  getting into the team, i'm just, nervous that it might be too tough to handle. another cause of worry would be the attendance of my squad and my juniors. we are expected to pump 10 times for every NCO who doesn't turn up. and 8 of them didn't turn up during the previous training. *gulps*  I did  urlLink this  cos' i felt like i didn't have a life. * boredom envelops pearls *
