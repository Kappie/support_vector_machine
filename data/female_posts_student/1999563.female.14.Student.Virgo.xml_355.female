So me being stupid I was like lets go home so I can get my sweatshirt cuz i'm cold.  So we were in quite a rush.  On the way home all the sudden I saw these flashing lights and I was like  "Oh crap."  My brother got a speeding ticket.  Yup, my perfect brother. This is the first time I have ever seem him speed, ever. It was horrible.   So we stopped by home and my mom found out so i like started to cry.  So my mom was like "Lets go to tennis" So I went and my eyes were all red because it was so horrible.  And everyone was like "are you okay?" haha.  I was a half an hour late. It was BAD!  But my coach was all nice and wonderful.  Then they did the introductions where they introduce like the top jv doubles.  So I was just standing there being bored because they never say my name...  and like the fourth name they were like "Laura Warman" and I was like "what the heck..whats going on?  Then the coach was like "Your on! Get out there!"  So I was like "YESS!" then a girl on my team named melissa was like "I really wanted to play with you so I asked the coach if I could."  She is the nicest girl EVER!  Oh my goodness. It was crazy,  Then I played like the best game of my LIFE! I only missed 2 serves! I rocked! And all this while playing like the top jv doubles.  It was AWESOME!  Then when my game ended I hung out with Sara and Hope! it was F-U-N! Then i had to go home and Emily and Johanna came over and we worked on our spanish project. Its pretty spiffy!  Yeah.  I guess thats it!  Talk to ya'll later! :)  Laura
