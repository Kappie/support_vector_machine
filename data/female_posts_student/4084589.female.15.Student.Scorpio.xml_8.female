You think that the next morning will be when you start on the road to good health, rested and fresh. It's early, and you're sleepy. You think you can put your head down and be out, dreaming, floating. Your body will do the things it needs to do to function right. You'll be aces in the morning!  But what's this, now.  The pillow doesn't feel right. Your neck hurts, it's not the right thickness and your spine feels all strange. You can't remember how it is you've been sleeping for the last three decades -- on your back? side? stomach? How come every position feels wrong? There's not enough blanket. The sheets are tucked in at the foot of the bed, so you can't move right. How can you sleep on your side if you have two arms? Where in Hell do you put that other arm? Your circulation feels off. Are you breathing right? Listen to the speed of your inhaling and exhaling. Does it match your bedmate's? Why has this supposedly involuntary act suddenly become a skilled task of precise timing? Why isn't your jaw sitting right? How should your teeth be aligned while you sleep? Mouth open? And your eyes -- where do they go when you sleep, do they roll back into your head? Are they rolling back right now? The things you see moving around in the dark, are they inside your eyelids or inside your skull? Or are they actually in your eyes?  The mobile. Youput it to chargeit but you didn'tturn the switch on. Or did you? And what about thehidden fags, did you forget to hide it after the secret smoke, or is it safely tucked in the crack of your closet? Is the closet door open? Is thebedroom door locked? Did you set the alarm clock? Oh god, the clock, it's been a full hour since you got into bed, it's already tomorrow and you swore that wouldn't happen, you need to sleep! But the pillow feels strange, and can't stop thinking about how you're going to hit the snooze alarm again and again, and all you want is to sleep sleep sleep but it's really all a waste of time, lying here and worrying and looking at the clock. You could just get up and get some work done. How come you can fall asleep in English class, but not in bed?  Please, let sleep come and stop looking at the clock, put black tape over it and spin around until you're dizzy and sick and wobble onto the bed and fall...
