Most of us are in the same seats.  Seems like it should be snowing outside and the November mix is in my head.    I have enough room for my group's three page flowchart on Real Covenants.  Susan has an index for her 80-page outline.    Sadie forgot her disk drive, but will survive on the school's wireless system.    Wonder when the computer guys will get in here and tell us how to do this thing.    Once this exam is done, we'll be on our way and there will be no going back.    Still have 27 minutes to change my mind.
