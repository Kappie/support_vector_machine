It was so confusing for me...not that I wanted it to be.  I felt really bad cause I kept having to ask "how do I do this....how do I do that??"  I think I have a little bit of a better understand now but last time I thought that I just go confused so I don't want to get over confident.  I just hope I can really understand the stuff for the quiz.  I am very afraid of the chem unit test for stoich.  I am really trying but my work is non-reflective of my effort at the moment.  The first quiz of the unit I got a 48% and then today I asked to go over my second quiz and I got 25%.  If I can't pass the quizzes then well that of course makes me worry about the unit test.  I need to do good, but if I am trying for the quizzes and I am not doing well then what will make anything different on the unit test.  All I ever do is practice, practice, practice, but that isn't really paying off at the moment.  Today I actually thought the chem teacher was being nice.  I felt she was actually very polite to me and I think she felt empathy for me cause of how I did on the quiz.  It was actually a nice to change to how I feel she normal acts when I don't seem to understand something.  Everyone kept saying they liked me hair though.  I am not really sure if they were telling the truth or if they were sincere.  I wanted to be different today.  Going for the cute look ya know.  I think I wanna do something to my hair - but there ain't no way I am cutting it again..I HATE short hair...ECK.  Maybe a dark color...with a red through it...yeah that is what I like for winter.  I need a change.  I positive change for once.  Yeah treat myself of something.  Make myself feel loved.       Hmmm I am so gald there is no school tommorow.  I have so much to catch up on and do.  I have the religion test, the chem test, the social test, and the math quiz.  I have way to much on my plate and I thought cutting out extra curricular would be a good thing but I miss it.  I miss being always busy and doing things I like.  Now when I fail at school I feel like I fail at everything cause I don't do hardly anything anymore!  Sigh...there are so many things to worry about when your in high school.  Yesterday night Ben, Melissa, Me, my Mom, my Dad, Grandma, and Uncle had a big turkey dinner.  It literally felt like Chrismas holidays.  Oh and I bought...the Finding Nemo DVD cause I love that movie and it is awesome but my sis took it back to their trailer so I probably won't get it back til the weekend or next time I see her.  Newayz yeah it feels good to get all my thoughts down and clear em from my head right now.  I think I am going to go try to finish my math assignment.  I was looking at all the older pictures and I came across ones from my party and when me and Chels used to be like way better friends.  And well yeah over summer we basically spent our entire lives together, she even put up my patio set with me and we spend like a million days together doing a million things.  When I remember all the great things it's sad to think that we are not as close anymore.  Here is a pic of me and her in August on the day of my birthday at my house and yeah it reminds me of some great times.
