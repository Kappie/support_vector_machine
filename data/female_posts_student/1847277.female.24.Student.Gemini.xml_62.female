But you can't always get what you want...  Going out for Veronique's birthday tonight.  Should be fun.  Although I'm nearly broke so I won't be able to do much partying.  Plus, I have enough to do this weekend that I shouldn't be dealing with potential hangovers.  I hope Matt and I have time to go out tomorrow evening or at least have some quality alone time.  Okay, alone but together- you know what I mean.  It's that time again- waiting for email replies.  Of course, I'm familiar enough with people's communication skillz by now that I know who I will and won't hear from.  Meaning less frustration when certain individuals don't bother emailing me back...
