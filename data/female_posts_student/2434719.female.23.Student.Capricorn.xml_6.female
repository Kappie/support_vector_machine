(he was in reality sketching something, and looking in my direction, but let's just go with a hunch here that what i'm about to say didn't really happen... he's probably gay and staring at the guy behind the counter who serves spinach croussants.) and as he gets up to leave, he comes over and gives the drawing to me, and just walks out the door... and i sit there, in shock. becuase let me tell you, no description of this drawing can tell you how beautiful he made me seem in his artistic interpretation of me :)  so of course i get up and run after him.. and as i catch up with him outside in the perfect spring weather (no rain, sorry), i'm speechless...   ............and now i will allow you to use your own imaginations as to what happend next. (and no, kentesheia, i did not have sex with him in my day dream. sheesh).   i don't know i just sometimes feel like a silly little girl when i catch myself doing that. i thought maybe, just maybe, someone else does it too? i'm going out on limb here people.  help me out. :)   all i know is i want to love him and make sandwhiches for him for the rest of my life.    please don't make fun of me.  you'll break my silly little romantic heart :)
