I found this while surfing, can't remember where though. Check it out, it's really cool. You have to answer a couple of simple preliminary questions but you don't have to join anything and it's pretty awesome.  http://www.20q.net/index.html  Again I appreciate the comments and will post some more tomorrow on the situation and odd ramblings from my recently feeble and confused mind.  Especially to : Anonymous who has been most helpful, I'd really like to know how to contact you for general conversation or is that not allowed in the blog world? :o) I checked out the site you directed me to yesterday and I am learning alot from there, I appreciate the advice!! :o)  Dawn
