I met this girl Michelle, and I asked her to help me find a new best friend. After months, I tought I never found one. Then at night, it came to me, Michelle had become my best friend. I was really happy then. Ever since then, me and her became really close. My cousin Hitakshi had a friend named Kiran. I started to be friends with Kiran too. She was one year older than me but we were really close. I would consider her as my second best friend. But after a few months, I had realised that I wasn't close to neither Michelle nor Kiran. Instead, they became much much more closer. That really hurt me so I started hanging out with the bad girls which totally ruined me.   This year, Michelle was in my class again. I tried to forget everything that happened last year and the girl who sits next to me Stephanie, she's really cool. Then, Stephanie and Michelle became my best friends. We were in our own club, Club Sanity. It was VERY cool. People would have DIED if they were allowerd to join. Im serious, Club Sanity was quite popular. But, later on...Michelle and Stephanie were very close. It was like a deja vu moment for me when I realised what was going on. Stephanie and Michelle was a reminder of the Kiran and Michelle story. To make sure, I took notes on what was going on and I was right. I was being left out again and I was looking my best friends...   After that, I knes Stephanie wouldn't care on what I did. So I didn't care if I hurt Stephanies feelings. Stephanie is a new girl in the Baiduri (the first class among all four) class. She was a former Delima girl (Delima is the second class). She wasn't used to the former Baidurians like me. I didn't care if I would talk about boys all day long. I would be who I am. I know I shouldn't try to please someone and at the same time, I'm hurting myself. So I decided to be me again. Remember those 'bad girls' I told you about? Well, they are now my best friends and I dont care what my parents and teachers and my old friends think about them, all that matters is that I shouldn't go threw that 'deja vu' moment again.   Now, I have to say...seing Michelle and Stephenie get so close, I do get jealous at times...cause the friendship they share was once a part of me too. Stephanie is the shy and quite kind of girl. Michelle is the rude and smart girl. I am the loud and wild one. We were the best of friends at a time. Now, to me...that friendship was a history... the 'bad girls' are my future friends and now, the past is a choice. I can choose the old frienship I had which everyone loved and the new friendship I made which everyone dissapproves of...???
