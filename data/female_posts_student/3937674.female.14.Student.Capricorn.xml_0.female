I gave it up because the relationship between Ather and Lion would be way to far fetched. *********       								Prolouge 							  	A hunter prowled the shadows. The alley was dark, dank, and full of dark nooks and crannies. It looked to be straight out of a cliche. Someone walked briskly through the shadows, as though by her brisk, cold demeanor she could keep away the nightmares that lurked in the shadows. She was a business woman, dressed in a somber suit, and thought that she had grown accustomed to the darkness and undertone of fear that haunted the City. She told herself firmly that The City had one of the lowest crime rates ever, and those...things that were lurking in the shadows were nothing more than exhaustion and remnants of childhood nightmares.  She was perfectly safe. This woman was structured, organized, and prepared for every situation, up to and including attack. She had pepper spray in her purse and a gun at home, but neither were going to save her life now.  	She whirled. A faint noise from behind her left shoulder caught her attention. Shaking slightly, she passed the sound off as nerves. She quickly walked off, and on an instinct began to jog clumsily. Her heels clacked noisily on the pavement, the sound ricocheting off of the clammy walls, masking a faint growling sound that was her only warning. The creature leaped out of the shadows, at his hapless prey. A muffled scream echoed through the night, then all was silent.  *****   	Ai'Renn was a contradiction.  A 22 year old technogeek, college student, closet psychic , and sword enthusiast.  Her name was a bizarre gift from one of her foster parents, remnants of a puzzling childhood, haunted by shadows of reasonless fear.  She had survived highschool, avoiding drinking and drugs, but had been outcast from any semblance of a social group in her freshman year, due to a few slips of the tongue. She hadn't learned the value of discretion, and had revealed information that she couldn't possibly have known. She made it through only by driving herself scholastically to distraction. It was the only way she could escape the fear and loneliness. She had a certain fascination with swords, and after a long time of saving her spare cash, she could afford to buy a middle rate katana, and using books had taught herself Japanese swordwork.  She learned to write computer programs, another of her fascinations, and made a sum of money by doing quality webdesign. This, a well  tended savings account, and a scholarship for academic excellence had sent her off to college, in The City. She found that her tendency toward the macabre was fueled by the darkness of The City. She found herself loving the harsh skyline that the jagged skyscrapers  created. Though The City was highly modern, it had a peculiar trend towards a mixture of mod and gothic styles when it came to architecture and even interior design. Ai'Renn found The City's cool, apathetic darkness calming.    	 	She knew fully well why The City was reported to be so secure. Petty criminals feared what lurked in the shadows.  Murderers of any sort found that their prey had been taken by another predator. And the punishments for crime was to be given to the creatures of the shadows. Many things lurked the streets of The City, few of them friendly. Shifters, vampires, gangs of creatures unnamed. To encounter one was surely death. Which was the reason Ai'Renn was so fascinated with them. Ai'Renn was a hunter. She had discovered her own calling by way of revenge.  Jessica, the only person Ai'Renn had ever loved, had fallen prey to the self styled Merlin, a shifter with a taste for killing. Ai'Renn had hunted Jessica's murderer down, and avenged her. She swore that she would stop something like this from ever happening again, and had immersed herelf in dealing justice to the death dealers that haunted The City's streets.   	Her current target was a complete mystery. There was no pattern to it's violence, just that it hunted in the same area every time. And any other dark creature that entered it's territory came down with a bad case of dead. She had only one choice. Her allies had no information for her, she had no information about this latest batch of brutal murders, only the location of the creatures territory.  She could only go to the place where the others had died, and "read" what had happened. Dangerous, possibly deadly, certainly unpleasant, but the only option. She would not let this crime go on undealt-with. ******* 	Iris pushed her black hair out of her eyes. She put her head in her hands. One more day, she thought. Just one more. School was almost out.  Iris was a junior in highschool, who called herself Ather. She had a haunted look, fire burned in her black eyes, a smoldering spark of madness that threatened to break through. There were dark circles under her eyes. She had a vaguely Asian look to her, was thin, and small.  She dressed in somber black, lined her eyes darkly, hoping to mask the plain tiredness in her eyes. She had taken to wandering at night, in order to escape her home, and on the way, she had found Lion. Lion was a man, sometimes, and others.... no one really wanted to know. She had fallen in love with Lion. He was her Beauty and the Beast dream.  Ather knew she was insane, deep down. Something inside her heart had broken beyond mending. Her life was full of pain, sorrow, grief from the start.  She had Lion, though. Lion kept her sane. Lion couldn't speak, but she understood him. He cared about her, protected her, even when no one else cared.  But the only time she could get away to be with Lion was late at night.  	This is insane. The only person who cares about you is a half -human that can't talk to you. You should have killed yourself ages ago, Ather....
