The plans include this...my bro, Ben, my cousin Sarah, my wife Cassie, my Schimmoeller, my Candace, my Kim, my Eve, my Jessie, perhaps my Hollie, my Bams, gonna try to get a whole bunch more people to come, which i am sure i will, we fill that place, usually!  Belles is bartending too, my little pumpkin!  I worked this morning, it was a cool day, i had a trainee, then  i went to the superfitness to work out, i did a pretty darn good upper body workout,  i did bis, tris, and some pecs too...i need those, and then i did my ab workout and my cardio, got POURED on when i left, it was funny, i was soaked, i took Schims car home cause i broke my catalytic converter and the pickup is kinda laggy, boo..i hate that, but i got the cava....lier..ha ha, thought i was gonna crack on it didn't ya?  Well i really need a nap but i can't take one, i was up till one last night doing homework, well studying, now i am gonna hop in the shower, and get ready,TRY to look cute, my damn face broke out, i hate that, and head to flavors again tonight...hence the title, i am so catchy and gosh darned cute...hee hee....so for now, i am off, i am sure i will have more to say tomorrow....oh, after monday night, I owe RJ dinner, I have a picture of my yellow underwear, i probably broke Dave's back when i dropped him on the floor, Yost was hittin on my wife (not really, he's just a sweetheart and loves my friends) , Candace is bringing Jerry and Kara with her, actualy shit, she's not, I just remembered that, she's coming here, then we're going to sara's, ha ha,, wow.....i gotta work at eleven tomorrow too, boo boo boo, o well, signing off for now, Jess
