Everyday you think About your past, present and future Soon you realize that love Isn't anymore a relationship feature Well, it's ok You don't need to apologize Everything in the world Has it's day to die  As you walk away You know you can't love anyone else Your heart fades to grey And your life is meaningless Well, it's too late To stop and cry You should already know Time doesn't move behind  Everyday you think About your past, present and future Well, everthing that is good belongs to your past... Your future is to have a bullet in the brain And your present is to shoot it, at last...
