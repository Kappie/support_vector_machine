The first two days were beautiful. Sunny and warm. The water was so still it was almost like glass, so spent most of that time out on the water in my canoe. When I wasn't in the canoe I was fishing off the docks (FLOATING DOCKS ARE EVIL!!!) or coaxing my dog into the swimming hole.  Day number three my parents found a nice pike bed, catching quite a few good sized fish. None worth keeping of course, but better than the three inch pan fish we had been getting.   Days four and five we spent a large amount of our time inside. It was raining on and off, so it wasn't worth paddling out just to be flooded out. The wind was also making it hard to stay in one place. We occupied our time by playing countless games of Amun-Re, Settlers of Catan, and Uno (Uno being the only game I was able to win).  Now the cabin. That is a funny story. It was run down to the point that some of the walls were kept together with duct tape. The floors were so bad that when you got out of bed in the morning, you were forced to stumble down a slop to get to the door (Which was too tall for the doorway... IE, it was always jammed).   Because of coding, the owner was not allowed to build walls that went floor to ceiling so the wood-paneled walls where about a foot shorter than they should have been. The bathroom shower rocked when you took a shower, the furniture was cira 1955, and the water was straight from the lake.   This made for an interesting week. Even so, I enjoyed it much. With so little space separating myself and the other family members, I was able to get to known them better, especially Kyle, my sister's boyfriend. We talked about a lot of different things, witnessed a bird-window collision (The front cabin window), and learned was happens when one eats a hot pepper and cheese bagel.    I better go!  Ciao!  ambler
