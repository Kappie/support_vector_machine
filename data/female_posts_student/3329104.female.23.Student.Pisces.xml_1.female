Everyone in Spokane goes when they are in 4th grade and they go to this YMCA camp and spend two days learning about nature and playing games.  I guess it used to be sixth graders that go, but they changed it to fourth graders.  I had a cabin with seven girls.  The girls were great but I just thought it was amazing how many of them got homesick after two days.  I really wish I could have had a boy's cabin because they are much more fun.  The girls didn't want their hair to get wet, touch worms, or even put paint on their face.  I made the mistake about telling the girls about the "Monster in the Lake" and a couple had problems sleeping after that.  The boys were all telling scary stories with no problems.  I don't know, boys are just more fun at that age.    So most of the people who went as counselors were college seniors doing their final student teaching.  They are all graduating this year and pretty soon will be full time elementary teachers!  So two of the counselors were the meanest girls I have met in a long time.  They spent most of their time complaining about the "camping" and making fun of some of the girls in their cabins.  I could understand this kind of behavior from like the high school helpers on the trip but if anything these girls so SOOO much worse.  These girls have had at least three years of working with children so I can't understand if they didn't like kids why were they going to become teachers.  They were the trademark "sorority girls."  Don't get me wrong, I know many normal, friendly people in sororities, but these are the ones that you would see on that MTV show. Ok that's enough writing because I am going to get on the bike for a couple of miles.
