I'm guessing it is about JT...(duh?) Here it is, the chorus:    Everytime I try to fly, I fall Without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you, Baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you, Baby    Why is it that alot of songwriters write songs that relate to the artist (singer)? Do they sit down with the artist and brainstorm ideas from the latest traumas in the artist's life? It is odd.  I like it. What is she trying to portray? An apology maybe? It is a big contrast from her last two songs, Toxic and Me Against the Music. Reminds me of Xtina's step down from 'Dirty' to 'Beautiful'...although that was a dare (apparently). Brits should just get over him...man, he's not even that good looking. What ever happened to Love's immortality? Maybe this is the song I should sing on the Middle School Performing Arts night. (haha beth...) I like the tune, but unfortunately i can't relate to the lyrics. (as in a unfortunately in a singing POV, not like 'i wish sum1 just broke my heart'). Sorry this post has been meaningless...just thinking... Luv Casey-Mai  PS. Beth!  Is this meaningful!? I tried hard. :( I just blabbered on about things with no meaning....that is what every1 else does. Should I cram it with rhetorical questions!??
