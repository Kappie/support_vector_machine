She opened your eyes towards the sky And you left me with the confusion that is heart-ache.  ** Broken down trains, Burnt out planes, Out love faded in the dust Of your Camaro. Watching you head west Towards the sun And the endless freedom You found in saying goodbye.  I cried out your name Hoping you’d change your mind And come back to me. But our love was not to be. I was a fool believing you When you said that we Would always be My heart is broken and torn in two But I have vowed to get over you.  ** Broken down trains, Burnt out planes, Out love faded in the dust Of your Camaro. Watching you head west Towards the sun And the endless freedom You found in saying goodbye.
