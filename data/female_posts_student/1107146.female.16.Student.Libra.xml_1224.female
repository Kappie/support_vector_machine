I went to Target earlier, and then People came in the mail, so of course, I HAD to read it.  I mean, Matt Leblanc was on the cover.  It was too good to miss. And I remembered my Chem homework and that requires research, and so I should do it, that's only right.  And...um...yeh....I can't think of anything else that I can do.  Someone, help me, please!!!  Bummer about your computer, Will.  That sucks.  I would respond to other people's entries, but there are none.  Hummm...ok, fine.  I will go do my stupid math project, but I'm not going to be happy.  (Now is the time where I start cussing...in my mind, don't worry Linds).
