The exciting part is that I got to drive there (in a separate car from my siblings and with my dad to supervise, of course). It was going good and I even parked correctly this time! lol. Not something that's frequent with me.  However, after dinner...I swear my dad showed signs of PMS. What's his problem? Kept screeching about take turn now, no this turn!! Well, if I could concentrate maybe, just maybe, I could pay more attention to the light. Wouldn't that be much better? Not to mention, safer? I should just ignore him completely and only pick up when he's talking about turning. There. Well, it's seems childish--but that's how he's acting too.  Then, we came home after stopping for a few groceries from VONS (which btw he didn't help me upload or put them away--the selfish...). Oh, I bought a few magazines and some gum to add to the cart at the store in vengence. Do I need to know what the lastest trends for fall are? Maybe. Or what celebrity is dating who? Hell, no. But will it make my dad spend more money than he has to? Of course. (It's not as if I don't like teen magazines because I do read them but I can live without them.)  My brother Ryan, who's as irritable as hell, comments "Oh, you have no taste in food....oh, why did you choose that?" My response: where you there--NO, did you bring the food in--NO, then stuff yourself. That and I didn't tell him where the ice cream was or that we even bought it, well, Mr. Think-He-Knows-All can find it on his own.  Why is my family so damn moody?? Later, at home I found my siblings fighting over a ball. A stupid rubber ball. Of course, that triggered my mom. And well...the rest is chaos. Now, I'm not going to say that they're dysfunctional because they aren't but they freak out at the littlest things  way  too much.  On the plus side, I think I'm ready for my behind the wheel test. My permit expires on Aug. 14th and my test is on Aug. 10th. Think that's cutting it too close? It is! I can't believe it. One chance to make or I start all over again. I'll do fine if I'm not nervous though. And as long as neither of my parents are in the car with me (and they won't, yes!).
