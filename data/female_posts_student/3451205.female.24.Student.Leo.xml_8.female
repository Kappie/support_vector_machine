In case you haven't guessed it yet, it's time for the European Soccer Championship.   I think there's no word that would fit to describe how I feel towards soccer. I mean, it can be fun, and I played it a lot when still in elementary school, but as soon as you grow up and start thinking, you realize what crap and what hypocritical shit it actually is. I don't mean the game itself but the way it is played and dealt with in Germany. The media always repeat that Germany is a soccer nation and that "all" Germans are proud of their team, and so on.. well, guess what! I hate the team. They're a bunch of fricking losers who waste too much time fuckin women (never mind that they're married), driving fast cars, doing commercials, and lickin their money. It's ridiculous that some of the players get 2- or even 3-digit million dollar contracts and then all they have to do is stand around and kick some balls (well, I'm really talking about soccer balls now) without looking where their team members actually are. I've watched our women's soccer team play and some of the combinations they're doing are amazing. The ball's moving from one player to the next; no blind shooting, no fouls, just fair play. Our men's team instead is busy with spitting (oh, how I want to punch them in their faces when they do that), committing one foul after another, rolling on the ground crying because someone supposedly hurt them, and yelling at each other all the time. Our goalie is the worst. When he shouts at everybody else (and basically, that's what he's doing all the time), he really looks like a gorilla. Some clever fans even threw bananas at him during one game.  And of course, our team has no flaws at all. Whenever they lose, it's not the fault of the players but probably the weather was all wrong, or the opponent played unfair, or their shoes had not been broken in yet. Some months ago, there was a match between Germany and Iceland (which is like a match between the Yankees and some high-school team), and of course, our lazy German dorks lost the game. During the game, the announcers on TV made several remarks about how bad the team was playing, and they were right. I mean, it's their job to analyze the game. Now, guess what happened: after the game, the coach of our team insulted the announcers live and in front of several million viewers because "Germans are demanding too much, and we should stop expecting the team to win all the time." Hello?! This is Germany. Everything's about soccer! We're not supposed to lose against Iceland! Of course, the coach got away with his mean remarks, and he's still coaching the team. However, we lost the last preparation game before the Championship, and I just hope, we won't make it to the next round. We're in a group with the Netherlands and the Czech Republic; both nations have pretty good teams. I don't mean to be unpatriotic or something, but our team of losers (who are more aloof than you can imagine) just deserve to get their butts kicked.  So, starting this weekend, it's time for "Horaaayy for the Czechs and the Dutch!"  In the meantime, nothing has changed with the Mr Right situation. I haven't heard from him since that day when I told him to ask this girl out. I don't even know if he did it or how she reacted.  In fact, I really thought I was over him. During the past days I didn't spend too many thoughts on him, and I guess his telling me about his relations kind of roused me from my dreams. But then again, I found some old files of our online conversations yesterday, and they brought back the whole range of emotions. My attitude towards life is that everything happens for a reason, and I mean, this can't be it. He can't just enter my life so he could leave it again. I'm graduating in a few months and then I'll definitely go back to the US and visit him (unless he's engaged or something.. I couldn't take that). I know there's some hidden plan for us, but I haven't found out yet what it is.. well, I guess I'm back to optimistic day-dreaming now. At least, it makes everything much easier. And I'll cross the other bridges when I come to them.  So much for now.. back to studying hard now. Paaah..  May the force be with all of you!
