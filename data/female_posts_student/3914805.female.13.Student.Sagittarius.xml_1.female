I got home at half 1 and just blasted my music so so loud!mother's getting really scared about sprog who's on its way anytime within the next week (bound to happen the night of heidi's sleepover). i buggered off up the hill with Emma and Dave andi was unbeleiveably hyper when they got to my house. when we got up the hill i couldn't stop thiking about Darren and how i havn't seen him in a week and two days (sad i know but i did) and i think that he's avoiding me becuase well...he hasnt botherd arranging anything... texting him is like texting no one, i'll never get an answer. Kerry has no credit either so he can't contact me through that.anyway, dave emz and i have decided to make a film. a random scary/arty one. its gunna b like a summer prodject thinggy :D. anyway we left the hill and went bak 2 emue's place. we got a shit load of sweets nd redbull and ate them there. david walkd along emma's slippery floor and skidded only to smack into the bed jolt all the redbull up and crack up laughing. he turnd round and went "i didn't spill!!! no wait....yer i did..." it was the most halarious thing i've seen all day!!!!! he's such a funny dude and is SOOOOO going out with Emma in secret... hehheh... Well theres not much i can say now. Over And Out.
