Everyone at work always tells me that I should just take one or two shifts a week because my parents have money. I'm not a mooch, and if I'm going to have a job I might as well make as much as I can. Since this year will be my graduating year, I will likely cut my shifts in half since school will be starting and I want to have as much fun with my friends this year as possible.  Friday night I went to work and there was a strange, tense feeling going around. The owner and his wife had just found out that their 3 month old daughter has lukemia a couple of days ago. He is 35 and she is 37 or so, they'd gotten married about 2 years ago and she'd been trying to get pregnant the whole time and even went on fertility drugs to get pregnant. She is going to spend the next year in the Hospital in Halifax. I think it's safe to say the Boss's wife won't be coming back to work after all of her maternity leave is up. I didn't think she would anywaybecause she was excited to be a parent and would want to spend her time with her kid, but now I definately know she won't be coming back. He will be scarcely seen around the store now, too.  Mybrother's wifeis going in to the hospital on Wednesday to have her labour induced, and all I could think of is that something like this could happen to my new neice/nephew and it's scary. Anyway, I booked Wednesday off work so I could go over to the hospital with my brother. It's their 2nd child and she's only 23 and he'sgoing to be 25 next month and they're married and have a huge income. I'm pretty proud of them.  Next week I start driving school, I have my beginners but I'm going to go anyway so I can learn how to drive properly, the classroom part is going to be a waste but ah well.  After work I went to go see my Nanny tonight, I haven't been there since Papa passed away in May. It was so weird, but she's doing well. I've been thinking of asking her for one of Papa's old record players or something because one of the biggest things I remember about him is him listening to classical music.  I'm in a weird mood tonight.
