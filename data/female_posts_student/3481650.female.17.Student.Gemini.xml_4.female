From the 2nd to the 5th of June, Melanie McDonald, my best friend from elementary school, stayed with us; it was cool to see her for the first time in a long time. She really grew up. (But I guess I did too.) The Saturday that she left, my mom and I went to the airport to pick up another old best friend from pre-school. I hadn't seen Lindsey in 12 years, it was so weird, but neat. It was like having a stranger stay with me and being forced to get to know her. It wasn't like that was a bad thing, because we were both just really goofy and had fun watching like 8 movies while she was here (including Shrek 2.) After she left, I slept in my bed by myself for 2 nights. That Sunday night on the 13th, I left for church camp to Panama City. Sleeping on a bus has to be on the bottom of my favorite things to do list. But it was definitely worth it. I heard a lot of things I needed to hear while I was there, and worshiped God like I had never worshiped before. It was by far the best feeling I have ever felt. I'm glad to be home now, and it seems like I couldn't be any lazier than I have been for the past two days, but I can think of a few ways. Now I have to search for a job. I'm definitely not prepared for it, but I have to do it. :P  Mark wants to check his e-mail before he goes to sleep. Maybe I'll have fun this summer? That is definitely on my list of goals to achieve. I've been realizing that I am probably one of the most judgemental people I know. I hate it. I care what others think too much. I stress myself by worrying whether or not they're having a good time, worrying that they'll think I'm boring compared to other people. At the same time my mind is judging them, sort of making things up about them. It decides what I think about that person, and it sticks. It's hard to change it. That is also based on things I have heard about that person. I'm pretty sure I judge myself too much... I don't think I know exactly how self-centered I am. (But of course no one really does.) I drive myself nuts. Can sleep make these thoughts go away? Hopefully.
