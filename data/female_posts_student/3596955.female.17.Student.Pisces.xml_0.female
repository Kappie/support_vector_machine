The class assembled together in the *secret room,* stacked tables  chairs against the door  eluded any chance of making eye contact with him. Oh boy, he was mad. hahahah 'twas worth it!   over it.  After another amusing chat with 'the boys,' I managed to grasp a handful of definitions which I had never even deemed to existant before. Oh did I learn quite a lot that lesson. And let me tell you, it wasn't about computers hahah. Apparently, there is quite alot of gossip circulating the school! Let's just say a girl from Barker has become rather renowned, especially amongst the boys! Where's the dignity there? And you know what else is circulating the school? Conjunctivitis! hahah..the whole music department has it, another 5 people were diagnosed today. It's obvious since they walk around with sunnies on. Hope I don't catch it! Can't afford to get it *wishful thinking*  -- feelin greeat! --
