Omg....still feeling totally weird about not having anymore normal classes and stuff! CRAZY! I've made up my mind.....I aint gonna start stressing about exams coz If I do I'm just gonna flip. I'm just gonna go in and do my best! Thats what all my m8's have to do...expecially Rachel n Toni who's blood pressures are flying through the roof. You both will do fine! STOP STRESSING! Anyhow don't know what else to write so gonna shut up...lol
