The trip was good...a little too long to be away from my sweetie, but good nonetheless.   I'm only disappointed that I didn't get to see a lot of the people I had intended to see in New York.  The wedding was just insanity, it ended up taking almost 1/3 of the time I was in NYC and the rest of the days were spent running around like crazy or waiting for the old people to catch up with  me.  I finally got to see the Holocaust Memorial/Museum, took a tour of NYC at night, ate dinner in Little Italy, saw a ton of relatives and now I'm still trying to catch up on my sleep.  I've decided I'm never going to miss ten days of work in a row again, however.  There was way too much to catch up on when I got back.    Once I got back, it was time to move, to prepare for my wonderful interns to leave me (I'm SO sad about it.) and there was all kinds of family insanity to deal with as well.  It's been a stressful homecoming, but things are finally calming down now.  I'm just excited because Katie and I have plans to decorate my new apartment this weekend and I got my new leather couch and recliner to chill on.  Bruce and I have decided that they make excellent Nintendo-playing furniture.    That's all to report for now.  I'm still deliberating whether or not to post my pictures from my trip to my site since Bruce has offerred to "fix" it once I get my own domain.  That should happen in the next couple months.  Looks like I'll be learning html after all!
