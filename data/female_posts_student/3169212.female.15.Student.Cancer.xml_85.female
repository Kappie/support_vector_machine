Besides, it's more fun, messing with your mind and all.  Excuse me, but if they enslave humans, I don't think they'd "be more pathetic". Mind you, I'm not saying they're not pathetic; apparently, power and pitifulness have no correlation. I just want you to realize that you're stereotyping.   The Spirit World? Gimme a break! The "spirit world" can kiss my... Miss V's .... my ... boots!... for all I care. For one, I have a higher power working on my side that has got to make the "spirit world"'s apparent "power" look like a rubberband next to an ion cannon or a ballistic missile. For two, if most of us would be wiped out, I'd either be dead (in which case I wouldn't give a cow pattie) or ... elsewhere, where I'd work on finding a way to kick the butt of whoever did it, but I wouldn't be dead.
