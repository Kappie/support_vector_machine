We got some fancy sheet sets and bedspreads for our extra long twin beds.  Hermax called this morning and woke me up.  It's kool though.  But ya it sucks because he's going to Disneyland with his cousins tomorrow...and I'm going with his brother and roselle and my mom and our guests on Friday.  How gay.  We're going to the same place except at  different times .  Oh well.  Every time I talk with Hermie on the phone, it's so  awkward .  When we say goodbye, I want to tell him  I love him  so bad but its so hard for me.  I tried to think of why I'm like that.  I came to the conclusion that I am subliminally terrified of how he would react...  It's funny because I'm so  sure  of my love for him.  I know that I love him and that he loves me.

Everyone knows what happened between us (the whole cussing me out thing) but he acts as if none of it ever happened.  I don't really give a shit anymore.  And plus, as much as he annoys us, I must admit that I  miss  having him around.  Everyone konws that I'm NOT the kind of person to walk away from a friendship, no matter what went wrong.  Jenny Qin reminded me that friendship is  also  about accepting one another's flaws  .            flooble said that I am
