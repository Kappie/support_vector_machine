So i panicked, told morehead i wasn't ready, she said i could just take a 0, and i said fuck that. It took me about 5 minutes of intense studying and a lot of will power, but i DID deliver and i DID do better than some of the other people who had spent time actually learning the shitt. i only made a few mistakes, but she took off 7 points. I'm assuming most of them were "you might think you're good, but i still hold the red pen and i don't like it when little kiddies spend minimal time studying and still pull it off" points.   I tried   urlLink ASTRAL PROJECTION  last night. i got to the vibration stage had to quit because what came along and decided to scare the shit out of me? a ghost. a cute ghost that laced it's fingers with mine, grabbed at them, and left as soon as i asked them to. i generally try to keep all contact with ghosts/spirits to a minimum((except for maevyn, a very special cat that died)), but i guess since i was so... Open? At the time, that it was like a big neon sign for them. i suppose i am only afraid and keep them at bay because i would hate to run into an angry one((poltergeist)), and be freaked out for the rest of my life.  I was listening to some white stripes in the car with mom the other day and she asked me if i had ever looked up the meaning to any of the lyrics, i told her it was for the individual to interpret. It got me to thinking about how some people condemn things they don't understand. i thought, if you cut a Picasso into tiny pieces and organized all the pieces by color, you still wouldn't understand it any better, you'd only be left with a whole bunch of confetti, with which you could throw a party for dumb people. So think about that one, folks, perhaps the next time you find something you don't understand, look at the feeling, the mood, and never take anything at face value((unless it's money, and even then, it could be counterfeit money, or inflation could be moving so rapidly in the same instant you looked at it, the value would change)).  I was talking to jean today and she reminded me of a story. i call this story "Leigh Anne Sandwitch on Wheelchair Bread". in 8th grade i went to new Orleans on a class trip. We had an entire day to visit the French quarter. i was in a group with this extremely mean and evil girl named Leigh Anne. Nobody liked her, and it wasn't because children are cruel. She had broken her leg a few weeks before the trip and against everyone's advice, had still decided to go. Well since being in the French quarter required a lot of walking, she had been given a wheel chair. Everyone had tried to help her getting over bumps/cracks((the chaperone said we had to)), but she refused help from anyone. Because she had no guide, she was going wildly down the streets, yelling at us to leave her alone. Well she bounced along without any major problems((except giving us something to snigger about)), until we came to a large curb with a grate at the bottom, of course, we offered to help her, but she still refused. Well she flew over the curb, part way down the street, and into a big pothole in the middle of the road. The wheel chair and Leigh Anne toppled over, and the entire chair collapsed on that evil thing. Well she was fine afterwards, in fact i think the other people in the group suffered more from laughing so hard we couldn't breathe. It was a perfect comical moment.  Alright then.. Dinner is almost ready. I'm back on my diet today. I've gotten unusually fat over the last week or so and I'm sick of it.  I'm also sick of mom's drunk/sad/shitty/bad mood, which carried over from last night.
