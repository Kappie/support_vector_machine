I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you   I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear   I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]   I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you   I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you      I realised that my blog has somewhat become a music review site. Well, it's cool anyways. I love music ;)   I have been constantly thinking about my future. Contemplating about how my life in the near future would be like. Would I be in JC? Would I be in Poly? I would undeniably yearn to go to a JC. On the other hand, what are the chances of securing a stable job compared to a Poly student who has a diploma and more hands-on experience? These are a few questions that have been 'bobbing' up and down in my mind. Somewhat like... a 'sea' of confusion. And at times, the thinking accelerates like a  carousel.  To the extent of, hurting.     Ouch!  Haha. What am I talking about? Anyways, tomorrow is my last parade. I feel kind of, in between. Reluctant to attend training, yet excited to hand over the unit to my Sec 3 kids.      Off visiting Germany!  In my history textbook.
