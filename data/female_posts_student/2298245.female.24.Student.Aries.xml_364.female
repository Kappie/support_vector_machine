       
      I am taking a much needed break, heading out to dinner with friends.  Perhaps when I receive my grades for this semester I will be sorry I did this.  But right now, my sanity requires it.  If I don't do this, I may get better grades (though at this point, I'm sure it won't make much of a difference), but I might also snap before finals are over, which would be worse.
