(spelling?) my friend at school is now set on some africans are so sad and america must help them thing. and i really don't get it, because america really has too much on their hands right now, they're not being selfish. i mean, our educators, teachers, doctors, and money is out there, however their goverernment is corrupt and uses it the wrong way. but is that our fault? i didn't think so, and besides, don't we have the safety of the american people to worry about first? SARS, the war, deaths, murders, kidnappings, yada yada yada. i think people should research what they're talking about before they decide they know everything about it after watching some episode on the discovery channel about how a kid drownds every something or other time, and how innocent people are being suide and why isn't america helping again? oh  yeah ! i almost forgot!  we're at war now, and aren't selfish, its the presidents job to look out for america and the safety of those who live there  and president clinton was a good president? how about 1) trashing the white house after he left (how stupid is that? and childish...) 2) raping women, more then one 3) having an affair in the oval office 4) getting us in trouble with north korea (isn't the payback coming now??) 5) not doing anything about osama bin laden when he had the chance to put him in jail and everyone KNEW he was a bad man, and he let him go 6) bad mouthing america when he was out of the country... i mean how great is that president? sigh... exams and sleep now
