Yeah so me and laurel and anna are standing around waiting for nora and suzie and there are all these sticky gooey things hanging from the ceiling and we're like wow, ew. And then we couldn't remember what hockey sticks were called so we're like "hockey clubs? no thats golf..." So then the others got there and we skated for a bit then we went and got food, because we were hungry. So we're eating our ice cream (go figure) and we're having this conversation about common sense. Don't ask. So like everytime anna says something laurel goes "common sense anna!" it was good. Yeah and then laurel looks up at one of the TVs and goes "look they're playing hockey! Oh wait that's football" and we're all like laughing hysterically. And anna goes "common sense laurel. No, don't let the big green field fool you, its really hockey." And then anna is eating her ice cream and she snaps her spoon. "Common sense anna" and then throwing it away she gets her hand stuck in the trash can and "suffered major injuries." And then Laurel's like "I'm not gonna finish my ice cream, I'll just stick it in my pocket" A brilliant plan of course. Yeah so then while we were skating more these little kids with ice walkers like cornered me and tried to run me over I was like AAAHHHH!!! but then i speed skated and ran away. So then we're skating around some more and me and laurel are talking and i go "so laurel have you fallen yet?" and right as i say that i fall flat on my ass. It was very three stooges. My feet like flew up into the air. Anna said when we were in the car driving home "I saw you fall, well not all of you i just saw this skate fly up into the air and then i turned around and your like 'ow'" yeah good times. So yeah then we skated for a bit more. PS my ass still hurts. Yeah then we were gonna sit on the side for a minute so we're like skating towards the wall and anna's in front of me slowing down and I can't stop and i'm like AAHHH MOVE so i run into anna and we both run into the wall. And then Laurel comes and crashes into the wall and she's like "SHIT THE ICE CREAM" and its like leaking all in her jacket cus she broke the container. So we go back up to the snack bar to eat the rest of the ice cream and clean out her pocket. Yeah then we bought water. Then went skating more and we're like "ok we're not gonna stop anymore till we have to go home" which was fifteen  minutes from then. So we're skating around and my ankles were really starting to hurt. So we all went around one more time then got off. Laurel got off before me and had her face and hands up against the window facing me so i was gonna skate up and crash into the window right where she was standing, unfortunately i tripped and went like flying towards the glass and fell right in front of the wall. We both died laughing. I wish laurel had had a camera. Yeah so then we were waiting outside and suzie was going to take a picture of laurel so laurel throws her arms back (water bottle in hand) and hits anna in the face. And anna's all "what the hell was that!" she thought she had run into the wall. It was hillarious. Good times good times...
