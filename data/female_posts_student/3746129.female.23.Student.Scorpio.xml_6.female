Sun shines lighting the darkness Attempting to break my faith, The Holy Spirit invades like a flood Washing my soul clean and Strengthening my bond with Jesus. Brothers we are, Brothers we will be, When his glory ascends the heavens And his presence captivates the earth My roots are firmly plantedIn the soil that is God’s Word.
