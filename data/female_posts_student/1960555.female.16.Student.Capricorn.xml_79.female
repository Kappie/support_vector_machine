And yes indeed, I was the first person mentioned in her's!  Yay, Manda is special!  And secondly (or is it thirdly... I don't know anymore), Gucci, can I have your children?  You are my hero and I love you so much!  -hug-  It's so odd to have you giving me advice because I had a breakdown.  It's usually the other way around.  You have severally missed your calling in life if you don't become a insparational speaker.  Manda's self confidence-- up 100%.  No joke.   You want proof that Justine Prevost is the single coolest person in the entire FREAKING WORLD??  Here it is:     if its ment to be it will happen. and if he cant realize that every moment of your life your becoming more and more amazing, then he is the biggest wanker i have ever met. your smart, witty, lol your taste im music is sooo way beyond your years (in a good wise way lol) your pretty, hahah the fing funniest person to walk the face of the earth, and quiet possibly my drama queen kindred spirit. he is an idiot for not falling head over feet for you the moment he saw you.   Gucc, I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU!!! Holy crap, omg, what on earth would I do without you??  Oh, perrish the thought.    So, the point of this post is just to thank my very good friend Justine.  She always seems to know what to say and like I said before, she makes any shitty situation feel better.    Congratulations on your engagement to Ryan!  (So it's a little premature, it's an inevatable fact right?)  And woot to your Grandmother with her wise words of advise,  "A woman with out a man is like a fish with out a bicycle."   And on the topic of engagement, Ryan's home from Cuba!! Eeeeeee!  Happy happy everyone.  He have taken pictures up the wazzoo, or I'm going to kick him in the wazzoo.  (he promised me that he would take a bunch of pictures of Havana for me... come through dammit!)  So, The Haunting eh?  Good movie... well, good... interesting movie.  It's a hosh posh of like 5 other movies.  Whoa Nelly! Possesed girl at 8 O'Clock.  (The TV's at 8 O'Clock to me, thus the army position reference).  She's going a little batty if you ask my opinion which you didn't.  None the less, this movie just got a very interesting plot twist.  Interesting....  So I'm off, school in the morning dontchaknow.  Byebye, sleep tight, I love you all! -hug x 87-        ...you dont need him, hes an added accesory, and althought the accesory can sometimes compeate the out fit, your still stunning with out it. i hope i have helped...    Seriously, I'm going to cry.
