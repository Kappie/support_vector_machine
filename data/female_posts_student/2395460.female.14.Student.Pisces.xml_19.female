The Playdock works with the excellent  urlLink Delphi XM Roady Radio , essentially as a docking station that turns the Roady into a beach-ready boombox. You can use the Roady in your car, and then pop it out and use it anywhere inside the Playdock.   The XM Roady is a complete set for the car (receiver, antenna, cassette adapter) for about $120 and the PlayDock, which will be available later this summer will set you back about an additional $200. The XM Radio service is $9.99 a month.  Read the  urlLink Playdock Press Release .  Read about the possibility of PDA-powered XM Radio at   urlLink Engadget .
