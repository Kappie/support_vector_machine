Not a mile yet down the street, I noticed that the battery light on my dash was lit up.  At this point, not only am I panicking (my car is practically brand new), but I'm also on the highway.  I exit the next exit to get to the closest and safest gas station I know of to call my dad (my cell phone was dead - I neglected to charge it).  Not only was the gas station I had in mind really far away, but I got lost en route to it.  Christ.  Oh yeah, did I mention that at this point, my check engine light and overheated engine light was also on?  Hopefully you get the full effect of why I freaked the fuck out.  I got ahold of dad who said that If my car runs, drive it home.  Me, not noticing the steam coming from the hood of my car, drove the 6 or so miles left home since my car was, for the better part, functional.  My poor car was quite steamy when I pulled into my driveway.  The car cooled down, and we popped the hood to find an empty overflow tank and a drained radiator.  Me, knowing nothing about cars, said, and I quote, "Uhhh....".  My baby was towed to Toyota the next morning.  Not only did I not make it to my first class, but the news I received from the dealership was quite, if you will, disturbing.  Appearantly, a furry animal, probably a possum, crawled up under my hood and got stuck in one of my belts.  Subsequentially, all my belts (my alternator belt, my serpentine belt, and some other belt I think)  were broke.  The mechanic informed my dad that they figured it out after they found a gruesome mess and a "small animal leg bone" in an undisclosed location under my hood.  Needless to say, I'm still rather disgusted with the imagery.  I can only imagine what the mechanics were thinking.  Anways..  It's late Wednesday morning, and I dont have my car yet.  Hopefully, it will be ready today.  Dad was, Thank God, able to get me to my other class yesterday and pick me up, as well as drop me off this morning.  I might have to take the bus home tonight, depending.  Oh well.  I can only get worse, I think.
