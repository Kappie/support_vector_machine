Heather is sick--- yes, still!--- and I am pondering what to bring to her tomorrow to make her feel better. I'm going to make her dinner, bring some extra cans of soup, some movies, the newest Cosmo, Vicks, and DayQuil... I don't know what else yet. I guess I just realized that I am not the only person hurting right now, and sometimes I have to just paste on the "political smile," and be there for those that care for me, even if it is just a fraction of my feelings for them.     Lost Aaron's piano copy of "Aria," and called him just to tell him so. Completely dodging the verbal lashing I expected to receive, I can now feel just a little bit more relieved.    Well, I'm off to indulge myself in "Under the Tuscan Sun," and a huge bag of potato chips that just seem to be screaming my name from the opposite room. I'll be back tomorrow night, same time, same place. :-)
