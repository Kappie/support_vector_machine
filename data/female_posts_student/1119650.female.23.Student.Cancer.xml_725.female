It was so hyped from all of the people who'd seen it and by T.V. and so I figured it was worth a watch.  Andrew wasn't too into watching it, but he caved 'cause I suffered through Dreamcatcher for him.  Now maybe its just Andrew and I, but honestly we thought it sucked.  It was painfully slow, only moderately funny at best, there was no release, no real point.  Its just a couple more hours of my life gone, that I can't have back.  Maybe I'm some ignorant rube who doesn't get the "big picture", but seriously: what a boring, unentertaining waste of my time.    I keep having really violent nightmares at night and I can't sleep well.  They've even started to wake Andrew up 'cause I've started talking aloud.  Well, I dunno if I'm talking, but I'm definitley making sounds like mumblign or something.  I'm also nervous 'cause I started taking some medication that's supposed to make me violently ill.  I know other people who've taken this medication and they can attest to how sick you get.  They even gave me meds at the hosptial to counteract the nausea, but I haven't had to use one.  I'm scared the medicine might not be working, eeek!  Anyhow thats all that's new here.  You chicken fuckers better start leaving me comments even if I am boring, becuase I hate having no comments.  Poop!
