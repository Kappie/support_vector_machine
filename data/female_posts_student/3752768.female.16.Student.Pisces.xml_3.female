I went to the doctor and she said that it wasnt cancer that it was a real rare virus. I cant even spell it. But there isnt anything to worry about.  When we went to Kendyls cheer show offs she was so awesome...well I almost fell down the stairs and it was not funny...(ok maybe a little funny) Then after Kendyls cheer off we went home. Ryan came home with me and I started crying about everything. It was so silly but at the time it wasnt. I was crying about EVERYTHING! My mom asked me if I wanted some night night medicine. I told her yeah but that she had to take Ryan home at 11pm. She told me that Ryan didnt have to go home. So Ryan ended up staying the night and he layed with me and I fell asleep in his arms. It was so sweet!  I woke up this morning with Ryan nuggling next to me. (No he did not sleep with me) Then me and him watched Saturday morning cartoons and we made breakfast. It was cool. Then we went to his house and was just hung out.  I went home and got ready for work and 10min. before I had to leave. So he was telling me to have a good day at work. It was so cute. hehe. I love Ryan so much.  Work was boring I got to use the cash register and it was nifty. Well Iam leaving. Night Night people.
