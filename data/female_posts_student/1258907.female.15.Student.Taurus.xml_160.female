The chariot holding his beauty queen  What can he do to ease the pain inside?  What can he do instead of hide?  He needs to be loved, God  Please show him your love   I wouldnt mind spending every night  Praying for, this boy in white  I saw him once, cheerful and bright  But now he seems so sad and contrite  Always waiting to reunite  With his queen, it just isnt right       Where is his heart and where should it be?  The chariot holding his beauty queen  What can he do to ease the pain inside?  What can he do instead of hide?  He needs to be loved, God  Please show him your love   A tap on his window, a knock on his door  Outside his house the rain continues to pour  Tears from his eyes will just hit the floor  Screaming in pain, and just asking for, a minute more  Hes crying out to our Lord for strength  And the teardrops are wiped right off his face!       You know his heart and where it should be  You've got hold of his beauty queen  Your just waiting for this boy to decide  Will he accept You or will he hide?  He will find Your love  Yes Lord, he will find Your love
