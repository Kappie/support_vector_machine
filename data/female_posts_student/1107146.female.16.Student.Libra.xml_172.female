Well, I cut the bottom of the yard today, and the mower stalled about seven times, but after much undue toil and effort, I was able to get it done, albeit poorly. Afterwards, something in my head called me to go for a run, which I did; after the first lap, however, I tripped up the drive and slammed into the door, took a bit of the great ambrosial raspberry drink, sat outside, and recovered. It was a nothing-doing day thereafter.  Something vaguely troubling happened today. God, I hate dealing with these emotional struggles.
