When I was studying with my friend (the one who sit beside me in class), my BM teacher who is also my library teacher advisor came near and teased us. How? She joked “Kedua-dua kamu sudah janji belajar bersama-sama di sini?” It sounded like we are dating in the library. Haha… Weren’t we? Erm.. yes, I think we were. We have dated each other to do some revision in the library this afternoon from 2pm to 5pm. Hahaha…   One of the library users fell asleep, Madam Foo (the librarian) wake up the girl but she was stared by other students. Anyhow, she was just too tired; it wasn’t her fault. I was tired too. Somehow I nearly fell asleep too. The number of the Library users has been increased since last 2 weeks when the opening hours have been extended from 3:30pm to 5:30pm     ** Life's really tiring... =(
