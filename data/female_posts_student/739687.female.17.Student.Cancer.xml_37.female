But seriously, it really bugs me when people have to talk behind your back...it's just about the lowest, most immature thing they could do. If people have a problem with me, I'd appreciate it if they came to me about it. A swift kick in the ass would most certainly straighten them out.:-)  Anywho..some crazy people kept calling my cell yesterday. It was slighty amusing for a while...then it was just retarded. Well, I'm gonna get going now. Have fun everyone.
