I've been coloring for hours at a time and I'm to the point where I'm about to snap. Someone help me. Put me in a mall with friends and I'll be fine. Hurry...If you want me to live you'll put in the mall...Ahh....No just kidding. I'm not really dead but of course, you already knew that huh? But anyways, back to the point. I'm not babysitting for them ever again. Next summer I'm getting a job in the mall. I mean come on think about it! Air conditioning, getting to scope out guys all day, employee discount! It's making me wet just thinking about it. LOL.
