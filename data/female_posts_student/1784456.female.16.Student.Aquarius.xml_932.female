I feel really sick and oh yeah, being hit in the stoumach with a football really helped. Then afterwards I pigged out a bit in the tutor rep meeting. None of the girls were eating! :O I mean helooo! Free doughnuts and chocolate! YEAY! So I showed them how non-anorexic I want to be by eating every thing I was offered. Yep, I sure did, none of the other girls took any thing but  a few boys did. Woohoo! Go piggy little me! Mmm... good aye? Let's start an anti-anorexic piggy campaign! Actually... I have already! Better go play dumb games! Adios!
