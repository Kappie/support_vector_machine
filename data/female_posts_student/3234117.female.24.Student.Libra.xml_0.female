Either I'm pretty popular or I've reached 221 stragglers, since I really only have 1 reader---ME.  In anycase, more news on me.   So I started my Objective Personality Assessment class on Monday.  First day of class I get assigned 9 chapters to read.  Amazingly, it's 3:17 and I've read 8 out of 9 chapters for class tonight.  Normally I probably wouldn't read, but since we have quizzes now over what we've read, I have to.  I'm in graduate school--- what's up with the quizzes? To add even more pressure, if anyone in the class has an average below an 83 on the quizzes, we will have a final!  83 or a "B"-, is also the lowest grade you can earn and not be on academic probation.  Sometimes I forget I'm in graduate school.  Well, not really being in graduate school, but the fact I'm working on my Doctorate.  When my professor explained that in order to get an "A" in the class we needed to demonstrate Doctoral level work, a red flag shot up.  I'm thinking, I don't have a Doctorate, so how can I show Doctoral level work?  This is quite sad actually my thinking process at that moment, in fact, I probably shouldn't be sharing this with all my 222 viewers.  Oh well!  I've also been told by my friends that I need to work on my vocabulary.  I tend to say deers instead of deer or fishes instead of fish.  I also wonder about beer or is it beers? Ben and I were discussing this last night.  Which is it?  In anycase my friend Chelsea told me, "Rebecca when you get your Doctorate, make sure you say deer instead of deers".  I really do know it's deer and not deers, but it's confusing when I see a couple of deer walking by.  This doesn't happen very much, in fact never, now that I've moved to Dallas.  There are not any deers.
