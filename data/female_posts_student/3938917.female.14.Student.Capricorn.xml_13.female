Anyways he got online and the first thing he said was, "Have you talked to Tyler lately?" I hadn't since Thursday so of course I said no and then he said somethin about he was just wondering if he'd told me anything...which really got me angry because then he wouldn't tell me what Tyler's supposed to tell me or whatever, only that it's nothing I should worry about, but how do I not worry?? I don't know...it's so confusing and its made me crazy all day and so now I really need to talk to someone who knows...it's probably something tiny that he was just trying to make me worry about when really it's nothing to worry about at all...oh well, I guess I'll find out soon enough. -Nothing hurts my world, just affects the ones around me...  *My wrists hurt. They hurt bad; bad enough to make to make me forget about the blood that randomly drips down my head. I'm dirty and soaked with sweat, but it's a different kind of sweat. The kind that comes straight from your adrenal glands and makes you shake. Rope burn has eaten away the skin on my wrists and the sweat that slowly rolls down my arms reminds me that my nerves are frayed, but good enough to prioritize pain. How... how did I end up here?  I shift around in the chair nearly tipping over. I have no idea how you got me in this chair. It must have been during one of my classic blackouts; the kind that start on Monday and last for a days at a time. I challenge you to find a quicker way to the weekend.  I can't even remember how this drag race into a brick wall started. Christ I feel like roadkill. I assume I’ve done something wrong that you would have me in this chair tied up and padlocked?! For the love of God, padlocked? I don’t even know anymore; the blackouts are my carte blanche. This is all your fault anyway. You should know better. Moving into my place, bringing along a truck full of baggage in just two suitcases. I should have known better.  Nothing worse than throwing the two of us together. Nothing worse than you. I’d rather be doing shots of brake fluid than having to deal another day with you. Yet somehow, I have a feeling I’m going to get my wish; sans brake fluid. And there it is, right against the back of my head. The .45 I kept under the bed by the magazines and an empty bottle of Jim Beam. Not that I tried to hide it very well.  ”You never loved me.”  I let out a pretty good scream when you pistol whipped me on the head, but the real pain came when you circled around and followed up with a hit to the right side of my face. I thought my head was imploding, but no, just my teeth splintering and my jaw fracturing. That’s all.  I’m leaned over and I can faithfully say that this is the most pain I’ve ever been in. And now here I am at the quintessential point of existence, the end of it. You’re crying and shouting something at me. I’d like to tell you I’ll miss you, but lying isn’t the way I should go. I’ll miss this kitchen I’m about to cover, the burn that Jimmy B leaves as he cascades down my throat, hey I might even miss the thrill of the chase that got me here, but the shovel that dug me deeper can go back in the shed with the rest of the tools.  I'd like to go out with a line, give you a wink, a sneer, but I can't even breathe and you don't play with your food. You pull the trigger; a deafening pop and the silence of darkness.  From the silent depths of darkness, it comes back crushingly heavy and without warning; an ocean of conciousness drops on you and the sound is deafening. Black subsides to white and slowly you come to a hazy light in this room of your own design. Disoriented at best; the sweat, the blood, the fear and pain all fighting to register at the same time in your cranium. Your chest rattles as you try to breathe from the periodic bouts of crying and pain, the little you remember.  The crulest tricks are the happy endings your mind tries to write from the failures you have created. All you can do is wait to wake up. One thing stands out in this vertiginous shift in reality: The cold, round shape firmly pressed against your head. Your entire life balanced between your temple and the hammer of my .45. Cutting through the static in your ear drums, my parting love in a shouted whisper:  "Just remember baby, I'm fatally yours..."
