It's a big ass complicated paper about a subject that I'm not familiar enough with (international law...gimme a break, I'm only a 1L!), and life has sucked ever since that word entered my legal vocabulary. So, this is my second semester of hell! And of course, there is always life that is going on around you at the speed of light, namely boys, boys, boys. Gotta get them outta my head! Anyway, back to reading shit I don't even understand...hopefully you'll hear from me again after I've kicked the shit out of this paper.
