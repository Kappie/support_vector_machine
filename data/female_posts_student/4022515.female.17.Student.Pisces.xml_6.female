I'll wait, and pretend to be patient. **sigh** I thought he would never want to talk to me again, but then as I was making plans for tonite, he asked if he could come over. Of course i said yes, and so he did. We spent the whole time making out and rolling around on my trampoline. What does he want from me? More and more I'm leaning toward the friends with benifits thing. He is a boy... But I could never do that. I love him too much to just mess around while he dates other people and has no feelings for me. He even went on a fucking date with this chick my other ex, Marc, cheated on me with then broke up with me for. AWSOME! he even called it a date. When I went over to Mikes the other night, there was nooo romantic feelings at all, and I feel kind of bad about that becuase mikes a nice guy. On the other hand, I was too busy thinking about kevin for anything else to cross my mind. Ok, I've got to stop thinking about that. I'm getting teary dammit. On the up side, at least hes talking to me, the horny bastard. (I don't mean anything negative by the word bastard, if you know me, you know I call everyone that, especially cops). The longer he doesn't want to be with me, the worse and worse it looks for us. My dad said something today that made me feel a lot better tho. He and my mom dated for 4 or 5 years before they got married, and there was a point they didn't talk for 8 months becuase my dad didn't think it was going anywhere. But 23 years later, they're happily married. Still, I don't think I could handle not talking to kevin for 8 days, much less months.       On a totally different topic, I'm going to coach 5/6 grade volleyball for my grade school, MGC. Thats pretty exicting. Actually, I'm not for sure I'll be coaching them becuase I'd much much rather coach cheerleading. The only problem with that is cheerleading is a two season, 5 day a week sport, and I'll have so much else to do my senior year, with college apps and AP classes and parties and whatnot. We'll see what happens.      I think I'm going to try to get some sleep, even though I know I won't. I take that back. I'm going to watch TV or something, maybe he'll call.       grrrr (thats my tiger growl cuz I'm fusterated)
