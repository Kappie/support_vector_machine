I quite like the way Blogger has such simple settings and formats so that complete idiot such as myself can use them without getting completely flustered. We made four trips up to the new house today, each in the van loaded with boxes of Bathroom Stuff, Bedroom Stuff, Office Stuff, but most of all, Useless Stuff. I was entrusted/tortured with the task of throwing out the old shoes that no one wears anymore, so I spent a good half-hour rummaging through the old, disfigured shoes that a family of rats were using as their nest. Two garbage cans were filled with rat poop-filled tennies, sandals, and heels. I'm glad to say that we've made great progress. That's stated as I consume the last of the Spam at the very back of the cabinets and steal the rotten salad away from my sister for dinner. Just kidding. I wouldn't touch Spam unless I was starving, and we still have a reasonable amount of food in our fridge, as well as necessities around the house. But then again, the truth is, our refrigerator and cabinets are usually packed stiff with food, and we must have moved up five or six boxes labeled "Kitchen: Unpack me first" alone. Thank goodness our new house has a pantry, or else all the soy milk my mother stocked up on wouldn't fit. As for the rest of the moving, I would say it's going very well. My arms are thoroughly tired, and my back feels strengthened. I'll be living next to Stephanie Wong, and some Mexican guy on the other side. On Thursday, Lindsay, Jieun and I are finally getting together. I wish we could be all moved in, so they could come over to our house, but instead we're going to Jieun's. Movies I've recently watched: Fifty First Dates Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (again) How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days I hate Adam Sandler movies, in general, but Fifty First Dates was the best one I've seen yet, and I must say, it was pretty good. There was still some of the crude humor that seems to follow him around, but it was bearable, and at times funny, and the story was really catching. It was touching at times, endearing, and I woulnd't mind watching it again. The Return of the King, well, for the fifth time, it was still good. If you haven't watched this, go watch it, you dodohead. Actually, watch the first two and then this one. I'm thinking about having a Lord of the Rings-fest at my house, followed by a sleepover, for "Mr. S's lunchtime crew" minus Cissy (sniff), and maybe with some other people added in. It should happen once we move and settle in... How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days was cute. It wasn't great, especially for a chick flick, but I liked the plot ideas and Matthew McConaughey is just so good looking. Kate Hudson is really cute, too, but at times I got rather annoyed at her, although I knew that she was being purposefully clingy or overly-sensitive or whatever. A rainy day sort of movie.
