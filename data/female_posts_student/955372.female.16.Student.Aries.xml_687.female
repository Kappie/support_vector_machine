"You're wearing the pants of power on this one... and they're leather." "I could very much see myself starting on a Viking longhouse before lunch" "Listen I keep telling you mate stop doing my work!" from Linda... "You crafty little carpenter you!" "It's absolutely pissing with rain"  and side note... HANDY ANDY IS GOD AND I WANT TO HAVE HIS CHILDREN... ok i'm done now.
