It was fun! Haha i literall was rolling on the ground laughing @ tjmaxx cuz my mom was looking all over for shorts for my dad and she was mad cuz she couldnt find them! than BAM! we saw them and she was like YES~! and yanked them off the rack but they wouldnt budge so she was pulling and pulling and finally they came off and her expression was priceless! All fierce..haha i cracked up!
