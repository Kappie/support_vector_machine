Thalia was there too and we talked and stuff and danced around and entertained some of the little kids (neighbors and cousins) that were there. I got tons of pictures of deidra opening presents, blowing out the candels, and just hanging out. OMG her mom got her shania twain concert tickets! (I got so many pictures when she opend the card that they were in. she was soo shocked lol. One of the funny parts that me and thalia thought were hullairus was when the phone rang,now they have many antiques around the house but a normal black phone so dee's aunt goes up to one of the really old phones, picks it up and says hellllo? and she just didn't get it she was like...hello..hello? lmao everyone knew it was the other phone but i don't know it was just so funny. After the party me and deidra went to Old Town which was fun. I rode a rollercoaster lol....It wasn't that bad..it just had a few drops that kinda made me freaked out. I think I've overcome my fear of rollercoasters actually. Just as long as they have no loops. well...I guess I'll post again later if i have a chance.
