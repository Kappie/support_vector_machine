I've come to a conclusion that, whatever it is and no matter how many fucked up weird things may pile upon the direction of how to have sex; I shall forever remain faithful to the missionary position in bed with a guy. Forever and ever and ever.  Anythingelse will not go. EVER.   Paul will be having his 20 candles lit soon. We're not quite sure where to go just yet. You're all invited of coz. Shouldn't be many who would attend since like only 6 people read this blog, but anyways; We came up with 2 choices.  A) Fragipani - We'll dress up real sleek and all sexy and stuff (Boys included) and we'll just see which boy gets hit on by another guy first. Or maybe which girl gets hit on first.  and  B) KTV lounge. Paul really wants this though, but none of us have found dignity to release our voices publicly into a mic infront of everyone but HIM. Turns out, Wookookoo likes to sing too! Or so we've heard, so that's just made Paul want to do it more since now he has a found 'kaki.' But we're really not sure.  Suggestions, perhaps?
