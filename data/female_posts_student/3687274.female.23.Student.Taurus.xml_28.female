I can't hold them in, I tend to explode under pressure.   smoking.     writing songs while having never taken the time to learn to play the piano.    playing the guitar.     starting things and never finishing them.     my job.    fleas.  I have 41 count'em baby!  41 flea bites.      military life.    tomatoes.   salad.   vegetables in general, excluding baby carrots.     cucumbers especially.   flowers.  They smell funny and then they die.   being poor.   driving everywhere I have to go.   not knowing how to accomplish anything in reality.  In my head I'm SuperThalia!!   having a 1.9 GPA.   striving to become more than average.   boinking.   being overweight.   wearing the inner thigh of my jeans away because my fucking thighs rub together.   worrying about being overweight.   my size 12 feet.   my nearsighted vision and my astigmatism.   being confronted when I can't remember the insulting comment that I made about your big nose, flabby gut, back fat, bellyroll, love handles, nose hair, chest hair, ass hair, small breasts, cankles, buthigh, or any other physical characteristic you have that may be less than perfect because 9 times out of 10, if it wasn't your teeth or height (latter only for males), I wasn't serious.   being confronted when I do remember the insulting comment I made about your way of life, intelligence level, and/or whoristic tendencies because 9 times out of 10 I meant what I said and I won't change my story simply because you found the testicular fortitude to speak your mind, assuming or hoping that I would change mine.   controlling my anger. Sometimes people piss me off and they never know it because I breathe and count and remove myself from their sight. Someday I'd like to remove them from mine.   compromising situations in public places.  (Shiver.)   guys with small penises who are in such a fucking hurry to whip them out at first sight of a pretty girl.   forgetting to call my mom back.     Neko.  He's the one that gave me fleas.  Cat bastard.   depending on someone.   doubting any part of me.    constantly thinking that maybe he/she doesn't like/love me because he/she/they did/didn't do blank.   growing up and growing apart.  No matter how you sugar coat it, it stills seems pointless now.   having to decide whether I should stay or go. If I need to I should, but if I can't afford to I shouldn't. Even though I NEED to.   my lack of privacy.  -------------------------   finding more flea bites.  43.   seeing my family in the position they are in and knowing that I can't help them without hurting them and myself.   knowing that I can't save the world...in reality.   Cause you know, in  my head I'm SuperThalia!!   finding a new job.   meeting new people.   dating. I wouldn't mind an arranged marriage. I've decided to just walk up to that stupid boy and say hey, I'm not really into this whole dating thing, so if we could skip it and just go get married that would be great.   the fact that my father is dead. Dead, dead, dead. How much does it suck when somedays you wake up and (on some level) forget that. After 5 fucking!! years. Oh, just a lil'.     I think I may have covered every dislike I have.   Everything else I can live with.       Nikol, are you sure you tried calling  everyone  Saturday??  Well, I hope Trast feels better soon and you get some grown time too.
