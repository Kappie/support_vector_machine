Um, I went and saw Two Weeks Notice with Jennifer on Friday.  It was actually a pretty good movie.  Very much a chick flick, but good.  Um, I've been sick... so I've been at home a lot.  Just bumming around, and being sick.  Taking lotsa meds, sneezing, coughing, losing my voice.  It's great!  I have been practicing my guitar, and I've learned 10 notes and a bunch of little songs!  WAHOO!  I'm actually pretty good, if I do say so myself... ;)  I'm really enjoying my break, and not having to worry about lots of reading and stuff every night.  That's been really nice.  I pulled off a 3.0 from my classes last semester!  YAY!  So, it bumped my grade up a bit... I'm at a 2.89... I wish that'd round up to a 2.9... that'd be nice.  But, I think after next semester I'll be golden.  Um, we're taking the tree down, soon.  I'll miss it!  Of course, the past 3 days, I haven't been able to smell it anyways... Nothing going on in the dating scene really... I (thankfully) haven't gotten any more calls from Joe... but you never know if I will... he's so friggin' predictable, though... and with that in mind, I would guess that by Valentine's Day I will receive more phone calls... I hope he looks at it as an "I'm missing out...!"  GOOD!  He is... but I'll NEVER date him again... EVER!  There are many nicer guys out there... and I will marry someone who will treat me like a princess... :-)  He's not worthy of me.  Anyhow, I'll be going to Houston a week from Friday!  I get to see my brother's new apartment... and hit the town with him.  I hope I get to see Dave and Jana and Hayden!  I have a feeling that Wolf is going to bail out on me for Blast!  here in San Antonio.  Oh, well... if he does, then I guess I'll find someone else to go with me.  I hear thunder outside, which means the "tornado" is coming... yes, that's right... we have a tornado watch...  They apparently got "strong signs" of tornadic action... so I go now... I'll post more later... and fill you in on my crappy (sick) life...!  :-)  If I don't post before 2003.... HAPPY NEW YEAR to everyone!  I'll be pissed at midnight on 1 Jan 2003!  :-D  Comment if you must... ;)       urlLink  postCount('30Dec2002');
