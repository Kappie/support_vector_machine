I got a regular babysitting job from this woman who is getting her teaching certificate or her degree or something. They have two crazy kids; two little girls. One is about 5 and the other is about 3, I think. Lisa and Jessica. They had an 18 year old brother so they are pretty rowdy a lot of the time. Basically, we just watch movies, color, run around the house, and act all crazy. The people pay $9/hour so it is completely kick-ass. I babysit for them Mondays and Wednesdays, so no more youth group for me. :( Oh well. The only people who are worth seeing at youth group are Ellen (I see her every freaking day anyways), Cassie (I see her every day at school and at church), Brian (I don't get to see him very much except on weekend because we always get him grounded or he is working), Matt, Emily, Kevin, ... I think that is about it.   The reason that I was giddy last entry was because Brian had just asked me out that afternoon -- very adorable boy.     urlLink       ^ There is a picture of us at Senior High Gathering (me and Brian are the ones on the farthest right). SHG was kickass! Me and Ellen were in the same hotel room, and we went to the zoo too. I took pictures of every freaking animal in that whole zoo. And then there was a dance like there always is, but the music was so freaking gay. Me and Brian slow-danced which completely pissed off Ellen because she used to really like him and she still liked him then. So, she went off to pout with Michelle (annoying tag-along girl from our church who is friends with Cassie) and Karen (a girl that we knew from the year before). So, after the slow dance because everyone was leaving, we went into the other room where there was Pirates of the Caribbean playing on a huge screen. I was sitting next to Brian and Ellen was acting all pissy. Then Brian put his arm around me, and Ellen just got up and walked away with a huff. I went to follow her, but then I saw that she was going to the bathroom so I just let her be. Then when she came back she went to sit with Michelle. Later that night when we went back to the hotel room, the keys didn't work so me and Ellen and Brian were all outside the hotel room on the floor. Ellen was curled up in a blanket because she said that she felt sick, but I coudl tell that she was just plain pissed off. Brian was trying to talk to her and be friendly because she hadn't acted like this before, but she would barely talk to him. After we got in the hotel room, me and Ellen were talking in Spanish to one another because there was a sponsor in the room (Mrs. Goldsmith, Andrew/Frodo's mom) and we didn't want her to know what we were talking about. I don't remember much of the convo, but I kept telling her that "Tu tuviste su 'chance-o' pero no lo sacaste." She kept saying that she never had a chance, but struggling in Spanish to explain it was making us laugh a bit. That made things better, and she was pretty much over it by the next morning, though she did say stuff about how she would have bad memories associated with PotC for a while and how I had ruined her night. Atleast she was a lot more lighthearted about it...   That was Sunday, and that night we all came over to my house for a movie night. I hadn't sene Hunter since the Friday before when I had tried to ask him to Sadie, and all he did was try to make out with me. I liked Brian, but I still kind of liked Hunter despite what he did to me. Looking back, that was the stupidest thing to do -- ever. To take him back for even the little time taht I did.   LOL Brian just text-messaged me. He's not grounded anymore after we went out on Friday until 1am, and he lied to his parents about where he was and didn't answer their phone calls. My parents didn't even know that I was gone. :)   Anyways, back to movie night. Hunter came over to my house earlier, and seeing as my parents and my sister were gone, he started making out with me and I didn't really hold back. I don't remember why I didn't hold back now -- I just didn't. :/ I wish taht I could remember what was going through my head, but going on... Ellen and Brian came over, and we went out to Walgreens to drop off pictures from that weekend retreat. Then we just randomly went down Westheimer. We didn't know where we ewre going, but we just drove. Then Hunter was goign to show us where he used to live and stuff, but he forgot. So, while on Westheimer we found someone to race with. It was this black guy with a really awesome car. Brian has a kind of older Acura with a shitty engine so we got smoked each time that we were racing between stop lights. But we had less traffic in our lane so sometimes we beat him (like 1 time LOL). So we come back and we start watching American Pie, the first one, and it is all good. I am flirting a bit with Brian but mainly because he is flirting with me. Then Brian takes Ellen back to her house to go and get her stuff to spend the night. WHile they are gone, Hunter and I are making out again in the guest room and I don't resist at all. When Brian comes back I am sooo flirting with him, having pillow fights, etc. And Hunter is just sitting in a chair to the side of the room kind of ticked off. Yeah, he totally had a reason too, but I didn't see what I was doing at the time. I am a complete blond. So, it comes time for Hunter to go home, and when he walks downstairs I follow him. I was talking to him and he was pissed because he was all like "You can't just make out wiht someone and then go flirting with someone else." And then I saw what I was doing was so stupid. I apologized, but he was really mad and somehow I felt really bad about it. I said that I would stop flirting with Brian, but Hunter said that I couldn't. Ellen later told me that she and Brian were in the kitchen and thought that me and Hunter were kissing because it was so quiet over there. Then I went into the kitchen and Brian sat down on my lap, and I didn't resist at all. Then we watched the rest of the movie. When it was done, I went into my room and called Hunter while Brian and Ellen were talking in teh game room. I was trying to talk to Hunter to make up for what I did, but he was being stupid or I don't remember. Meanwhile Ellen said that Brian was asking who I was on the phone with and why it was taking so long. Then Ellen was laughing about something, and woke up my dad which really pissed him off because he had to get up in teh morning at about 5am to go on a business trip or something like that. So, she ended up not spending the night, having Brian take her home, and I going to sleep just then.   So that is what happened on Senior High gathering weekend. Next time I will probably talk/ type about when I picked up my pictures from SHG lol.   That was before he asked me out, but yeah... The saga will continue soon. I really need to talk about this because it helps me sort out my thoughts, but since Ellen prob gets sick of hearing about it (and since half of it is about her), I thought that it would be better if I could just put it in here. I don't know whether or not she checks this, but it doesn't matter either way. I try to tell things how it is, and I don't let my mind warp them into something that they are not. This is how I perceive things.
