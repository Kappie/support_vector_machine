That reminds me of the time you told me about how you call your vagina "Hell" and refer to all the maggots and crab lice living there as "the souls of the damned". Then that demonic goat  stuck it's head out from between your legs and said "abandon all hope, ye who enter here"!!! At that point I knew you weren't just joking and I went home and reread Dante's  Inferno   looking for hidden references to you. As it turns out they weren't so hidden after all. Thanks for the doctoral thesis topic in world lit., you loathsome whore.
