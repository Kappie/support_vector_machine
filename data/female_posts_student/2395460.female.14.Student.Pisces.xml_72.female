The Java-Log,by  urlLink Robustion Products, Inc. ,is theproduct of an ingeniousdiscovery by engineer Rod Sprules that coffee grounds burn hotter than regular firewood.Better yet, Java-Logsalso emit a "faint, sweet aroma," create less soot and CO2 emissions, are easy to light, andmake use of what would otherwise be pure waste created by our coffee-loving culture.   You can pick up a Java-Log for about $2.50 at Whole Foods, as well as other grocery and hardware stores.
