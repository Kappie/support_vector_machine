You wake up and you're absolutely ecstatic to open preasents but then after you do and you play around with everything, it's like, "oh...it's over." And this also means Joanne's leaving in 5 days. I'm just in SUCH  sad mood right now. I was like this last night too. I think it's just lack of sleep. I certainly hope so, because I loathe wallowing in self pity. Seriously, I feel so selfish but at the same time I feel like crying. I'm so overwhelmed with everything right now and I'm so confused. So very very confused. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. Not have to deal with school, and saying good bye to Joanne. Gosh, this ALL SUCKS SO MUCH!!!!!!   I've got this feeling that people don't genuinely like me. Really, I honestly thought people liked me as a person, and that's why they feel they can tease me and joke with me, because i'm a pretty layed back person, but i have this feeling that very few band people actually like me. Like...I feel like really no one likes me. I'm just kind of there.   I don't know. I just need to go do something...sleep maybe...
