"Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon."   "When you are a Bear of Very Little Brain, and you Think of Things, you sometimes find that a Thing which seemed very Thingish inside you is quite different when it gets out into the open and has other people looking at it."  "Poetry and Hums aren't things which you get, they're things which get you. And all you can do is to go where they can find you."   Pooh is oh so wise.  I wonder if someone would be nice enough to buy me the "Tao of Pooh" from my  urlLink Amazon.com Wishlist .  God, that was a shameless plug!  (::Cough:: I'd also like the "Te of Piglet"::cough::)
