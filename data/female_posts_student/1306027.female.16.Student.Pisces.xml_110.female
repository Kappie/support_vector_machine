It was a dark, stormy night... I was on crosswalk with the other condiments and the potatoes (ketchup (Frank Lee), honey.dijon (Kale.. lol..), and french.fries (Farf)), and ketchup randomly goes "Yea, you have to hold on to your luggage in an airplane because....Shift Happens." I was cracking up so hard. Lol, and tim could here me on the mic, we were cracking up together. It shouldn't have been all that funny, but since we were all lacking in the sleep department- it was HiLaRiOuS!  Yea, so, I thought we were past it, but apparently we weren't. Yesterday, whilst chatting with my dearest buddy SJ on crosswalk, someone goes "Yea I have never fell into a toilet". And, me, being the awesome witty and truthful person I am, said: "Yea I fell into a toilet once. My little brother had left the seat up.. and.. I didn't see."   Lol- so tim goes... "And when that happened- did you say "Shift Happens" ??  Omg, I was rolling. I fell of my chair I was laughing so hard. Then I felt that sudden urge to go pee... so I did a crotch dance and ran upstairs.   Yea, so that's the story on "Shift Happens". I hope you enjoyed it.   I leave you with this... never toss a cat downwind.
