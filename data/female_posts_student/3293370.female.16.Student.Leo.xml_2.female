When I got home, I gave Mark a call and he came and picked me up and we went back to his house to watch Shrek. It was fuuun. We were all alone watching a movie for like 2 hours and he didn't pull anything. He's too good to be true. I mean, there were a couple kisses, but it's not like he was trying to shove his tongue down my throat. He's such a sweetie, how did I get so lucky? I don't know either, but whatever happened, it sure makes me happy. Oh geez, he's so awesome.
