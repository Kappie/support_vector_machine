My life is one journey of déjá-vu Always on the road to eternal sadness All the same things each day Feeling the old feelings.  I'm sick of it I want to live something new Before I criend because I was depressed Now I cry because I have to.  Everything is one big merry-go-round Passing everything once more But not is all as it seems And my existance is far from a theme park ride.  It is a never ending escapade A trail marked by tears I only know where to go because I follow I follow the path of blood.  The trail is long and tormenting Is is very full Dieing people push each other through Because everyone wants to finsh first.  I am knocked to the ground And Jesus comes down to me He tells me of a better, empty path And asks me to trek it instead.  He is awaiting an answer While the damned joslt past I contemplate Jesus' offer "Fuck no" I say and continue on my journey to the School of Satan.     To be continued...
