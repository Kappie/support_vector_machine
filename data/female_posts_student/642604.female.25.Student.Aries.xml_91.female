It appears that this will be the finale to a great summer of Dave shows. Of course I still have more concerts to look forward to this year because I never stop! I think I still have Blues Traveler with DC Sessions (free concerts always rock!), I have John Mayer coming up sometime in the next couple of months at Constitution Hall and of course I am constantly checking all the local venues and my favorite little band websites to see who is coming when and where. Just can't get enough music. I am a friggin addict! I have spent all morning now scouring the Walther Productions Page just hoping for a glimpse of Deep Banana Blackout or The Recipe! I am going crazy not having my fall concert schedule not planned out yet! But to get my Jam Band fix... OH DEEP BANANA BLACKOUT JUST CAME ON! Way too coincidental for me!... I am listening to the Jam Band Radio which I connect to through jambands.com. For those who like Moe., Deep Banana Blackout, Phish, Gov't Mule, etc. this is definitely for you! So while I figure out what other concerts I can head off to this year I will still be enjoying those I still have booked... LIKE TONIGHT!
