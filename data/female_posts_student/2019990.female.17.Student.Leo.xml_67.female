We learned about picas the first day of yearbook last fall. But some stuff has been really interesting, we learned how to take better sports photos, I learned a bunch of cool stuff on photoshop even though I don't have access to it out of school. But still. Yeah, not too much to talk aobut. We got here, and there was no alarm clock, let alone a regular clock in our room, so we had to take an emergency run to Pamida to buy a clock. We found a lovelytimex number for approximatly $5, don't know who to set the alarm obviously, because it has yet to go off at the right time, but it does have a nice little nightlight that lasts for apporimately three seconds. Yes life at yearbook camp is grand. But we have team time now. Time to make up a sports page layout, and many other fun things. Have a lovely rest of the week.
