Ok so me and madeline had to present our science project today, and hannah was sick today so she has to present her part of the project when she comes back (well thats what Mr. samilenko said). So yeah but when we were presenting i was like hyperventalating and i was like about to puke! But mr. samilenko said that we did well, which is just WEIRD! but anywhat, i am so glad we at least passed! woot!
