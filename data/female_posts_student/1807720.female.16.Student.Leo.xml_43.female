And well me, chels, eric, and andy all walked to school today cause the buses were all backed up but we got there in half an hour and beat the buses.  But well yeah tonight I just started finishing up my math and well then I got to my chem.  And well the chem teacher seems to think we have no life or something or she must think our lives should be chem cause I just say there starting at like a million questions and she have us like 2 examples and like no offence but I DON'T learn from seeing two examples of something.  But I guess I realized how overwhelmed I am with everything and how stresses I really am.  It was apparent to me tonight because tonight was just different.  I have never felt that way I have felt tonight even.  I was crying on my bed for about half and hour and then well I went to the bathroom to blow my nose and stuff and well I just looked at myself in the mirror and said "I just want to die, I want to kill myself" and then I went through my drawers looking for a fresh razor.  I picked it up and just held in there my wrist.  I don't know why I did this, cause well I have never even come close to even thinking about that stuff and well as I held it there I felt a calmness.  It was strange cause all my fear it was all of a sudden gone, and everything just felt ok.  I can't really explain why I felt that way at the time but well I always cry at night forever and that is when all my sadness and pain really shows, but it never shows for anyone else and sometimes I kinda wish it did.  Things are just getting really bad and more than anything right now I would like to just to talk to someone about things but I don't know how to bring up the subject or how to talk about things in that kind of way, and I don't know who would take my thoughts and feelings serious.
