I love NDP, especially the parade (not the school  -_-) when everybody is working so hard to perform properly and it is especially more meaningful if you have participated in it before. But I kind of hate seeing Stephanie Sun singing this year's NDP song. I think she should not be singing again, let somebody have a chance, girl, you are going to dominate the whole world if you continue and persist. I never get into the colours OR the merit awards, so sad ...>_
