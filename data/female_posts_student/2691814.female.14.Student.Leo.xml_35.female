Oh well..can't sing anyway cuz my voice is always going out cuz of my stupid cold and im all stuffy and i can't hear myself talk in one ear lol. Sounds fun right? lol...anyway I went outside after doing makeup work. Maybe once a month i'll go outside to see Gabby and Cindy. But anyway, I went out there and we rode around on scooters,bikes,and skates for a while. Pretty boring but as time passed a bunch of funny things happen but im not gonna post it. Jeremy is being such a jacka** as usual, thank goddess he didn't talk to me and Francesca as much as he usually does. Whenever he does talk, however we just tell him to shut the **** up and turn around. Eww and omg, Ms. Dempsey...she was wearing this totally grose green dress that was way too short! it botherd me..it looked like the rest of it was cut off. I mean...It was just weird seein an old history teacher wearing that 'thing'. OH ya  and CONGRATS to mrs. Walker on her newborn!!! yay im so happy for her...she was my fav. teacher for wheele class. Well anyway...hopefully something more exciting will happen later on. so ttfn!
