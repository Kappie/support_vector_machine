I had a german test, a chem test, an alg 2 test, a rough draft of my argumentation paper for english due, and The Great Gatsby read, plus a line test for theatre. Well ALL my english stuff got pushed back until after spring break as well did my chem test and line test. So, all I have to worry about now is my alg 2 test, which should be fairly easy and I already took my german test on Monday. Lol, I didn't even know we had one until yesterday morning since I was absent and I still took it and made an 87, what what! Too bad this means alot of work over spring break, well not a whole lot, but some.   Dude, seriously whatever stomach thing I have needs to go away. I think it's getting better, maybe? Sometimes it hurts when I eat, not as severe, but I think I'm getting used to it. I wonder if I'm like lactose intolerance or something, since it seems to hurt only when some sort of dairy is involved, I don't know. I suppose I won't eat any dairy for a few days and see what happens.   Time to finish my english quiz I got to take home, woo woo!    Don't waste your time on me you're already  A voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
