It's already May and I cry everytime i realize that the begining of summer will bring the end.  I didn't leave him out because he doesn't mean anything, but because he does, i didn't want to get all mushy.  But here's the truth, i can't imagine life without him.  When i do, i can't do anything except sit there with a broken heart.  I think of that time i took him for granted and how i would take that month back in a second, i was so stupid.  He's never been anything short of wonderful too me (okay maybe once), and i am so afraid to see that go.  The past few months have put a strain on our friendship, with busy scheduals and college plans.  I'm trying so hard to realize i have to let go, but it's easier to shut down and not feel anything.  The other day, we were talking and i mentioned a movie i wanted to see, he shot back.  "What could you possibly gain from seeing a movie like that, why would you waste your time when there's so much more you could do?"  Well, I want to feel again, i'm not happy, i'm not sad, i'm just empty.  I just want to feel moved.
