She is so strong, she may get well again. It's just her attitude. For all she knows she's living until she's 120 years old. John and Luann are coming over at 7. Bonnie's not here yet, but she should in 20 minutes or so.  Tommorrow I'm gonna wake up early and finish re-writing my fanfiction. I signed up for phototbucket.com today so I can hotlink my pictures for The Underground. I also need something to hotlink because I am getting a custom made icon from this artist. I have some of her Harry Potter icons on the enter page of my site. I need to get a picture of myself and either another person, or a landscape. I've decided on that.  Bonnies here, I have to go now.
