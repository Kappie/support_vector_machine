I know I vowed to keep you in my heart until the end of time, but you just can't compete with my shiny new cellphone. Plus, you're never around. He's with me always. Even in the bathroom. You just sit here and expect me to come to you. I'm giving in this relationship and all you ever do is take. Take. Take. I'm sorry, babe.  We had good times. I know we did. We had lots of cool friends too. But you know what? They all left us. Why? Because they could see through our shining smiling happy front. They could see the problems that lay underneath it all. All those time I tried to update and you were "under maintenance". Seriously...why were you  under  maintenance anyway?   So this is it. The tribe has spoken. I thought I loved you, but I guess not as much as my new shiny new Sony Ericsson cellphone. I mean, even his name is cuter. Sony Ericsson. What's yours? 'Blogger' Oooh...spiffy.   Goodbye blog. I won't forget the times that we had. The stories that we wrote. The lyrics that we shared. The comments we'd laugh over. The pictures we'd post. Honestly. you've taught me a lot. You taught me html. I'll keep you in my heart forever. Just not as close as my shiny new cellphone.   Love,  Parisa   p.s. -- stay tuned for a new blog/journal/diary thing coming to computers near you. =)
