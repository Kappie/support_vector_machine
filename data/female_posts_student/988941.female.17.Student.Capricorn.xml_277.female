I cant beleive how tiring today was, i nearly fell asleep in my Pe theory lesson cause we were doign some well boring test. I cant wait until i can sleep in in the morning. But of course i will be revising for the rest of the day !!!! Only 6 days left till we leave. whoooooohooooo I find school so boring now so until the day we leave...
