I have very little interest in this area of law, I must say.  One thing that was rather annoying was that all of the speakers spoke for too long, leaving very little time for questions at the end.  All except the keynote speaker - he did a good job of keeping his remarks down, and there was plenty of time at the end for questions.  Lunch was good.  Though I stuffed myself too much with food that I didn't have room for dessert - gasp!  But it could have been a lot worse.  It wasn't even too bad getting up at 6:15.  Maybe I will start trying to get up earlier so I can have more productive days.
