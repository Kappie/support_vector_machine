I can't go anywhere, my favorite music store Penny Lane isn't open till 11: something or rather. And if that weren't enough, drumroll please... No. Cute. Guys. In. My. Class. I have nothing to look at when I'm done with my work. But there is one guy I like so far. He's in my bff's class. Curse you Kim!!!! LOL j/k.  ~Still Bored. Katie.
