Walmart on a Sunday (don't ever go to Walmart again btw) is hell on earth.  Walmart  on any given day  is hell on earth actually.  Yep, there's nothing better than topping off a few treacherous hours at Costco with a couple more trips to other supermarkets for a particular item that wasn't available or suitable from Costco.  That's always fun.  Dealing with situations that include overcrowding can be particularly frustrating.  That's my beef with Costco.  I didn't exactly dig the vibes I got at Save A Lot, either.  The misery just hangs in there like a horrible stench; so thick you could cut it with a knife.  Once I almost slipped and ate shit on some cow blood that was spilled on the floor in Save A Lot.  It was from a package of beef in the meat section.  I don't think they cared either, because they didn't clean it up and I know they saw it.  You might not know this, but they actually have a section in the back corner of the store that is a "clearance section" of sorts, where they sell packages of opened or damaged food at discounted prices.  You know, you have a box of ho-ho's with a couple missing; they're still good though...that's the thing, most stores would throw an item like this away but not these guys.  They have some good deals though.  I must give them that.  Anyhow, that's why I avoid grocery shopping like the plague.  I loathe grocery shopping.  Although, I like Trader Joes.  They don't have a Trader Joes in Chula Vista.  I loathe Chula Vista.
