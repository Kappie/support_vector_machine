All those stupid little character in those ugly station waggon things Lokiluna13: and, what if I don't want a fuckin pink girl? Lokiluna13: What if I want a blue girl. Lokiluna13: ?  I guess this is the response I got...since Lauren put it in her profile. Haha, Conor's a crazy kid.   ConMan1303: i think a blue boy would be too masculine ConMan1303: sorry blue girl ConMan1303: and then grow up to be a dyke ConMan1303: and date anne heche ConMan1303: until anne heche decides she's not a lesbian ConMan1303: in which your dyke daughter will come crawling back to you ConMan1303: and she'll have had such a high profile life ConMan1303: that all your friends and neighbors would know you raise dykes ConMan1303: and they would slowly stop talking to you ConMan1303: until you were cut off from the world altogether ConMan1303: in which case ConMan1303: you would take your station wagon ConMan1303: and drive it off a cliff to end your miserable blue life ConMan1303: that could have been pink  The things people say....
