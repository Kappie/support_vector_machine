Liz, I hope you'll be back too, because make-up work sucks, but like I told Will, don't go unless ou are REALLY up to it.  Rosie, CALL ME tomorrow after you get home from church.  Hope you had fun at mystery dinner.  I want details.  I'll talk to you then.  It's late, so I'm cutting it short tonight.  Those of you who are sick, get better soon.  Those of you who are well, stay well.
