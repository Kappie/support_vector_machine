Well, My Mom and Dad are my greatest source of inspiration, I'm so thankful to be bornt into this world with such loving parents. I LOVE YOU MUMMY! I love you so much you have absolutely no idea how much I love you mummy I LOVE YOU SO MUCH... :D      Happiness is the world of life. The prettiness of the flowers, and the love of nature within.      Just a thought,  list the 5 people you'd like to be in your presence right now, with money, location, or life/death status as no issue.     I'll let you know mine, Sonority, when I post the next time. Lotsa' love, sweetcakes.
