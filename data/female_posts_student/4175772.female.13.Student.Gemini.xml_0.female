Parents are being quite kind doing this.  Now I feel warm and fuzzy inside! :) Watched a lot of the Olympics.  The USA's been doin' good. M*A*S*H started over again!   Finally!  Oh the joy!  Henry and Trapper and Radar and Frank!  No more preaching, for a few months now at least.  And that is all from Bran Muffin Central.  Abysinnia.
