And best of all!  Lots of linebreaks.  What have I done this week? Sat in a boring house mostly. Monday was the first day back at school. I was not happy.  On tuesday I went up to aylesbury to see my brother's RAF passing-out parade. It was good. There was a nice travel inn that we (me and my family) stayed in the monday night. We had a nice meal and there was this huge dessert thingy! Yum. Ultimate Chocolate Challenge, I salute you.  Wednesday I was back at school again and at Ju Jitsu, as he has already said, I nearly killed Rob! Take that you bastard! Or, y'know, don't.  The rest of this week I have been thinking about dropping Maths and picking up Art or Psychology. Both would be fun.  Party tonight at Bri's house. I don't know where it is! Huzzah! Vicky's hand will guide me true.   Is this a long post? Yes. Is it because of the double line breaks? Yes. Do I care? Not a great deal, no.  Yum.
