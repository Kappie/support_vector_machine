It feels so cool and amazing to know all the things weve been through... and i love him. It seems like a few days ago we were in california, in alexs basement, in my hot tub, on dxm at jessies, walking along the sanfrancisco pier , falling asleep in my love sac together, losing our virginity, kissing for the first time by veeley lake, wrestling, bouncing on my trampoline, feeling loved, feeling unloved, going to a show, laying around naked, watching stupid movies, being walked in on, not being walked in on, excitement, showing each other off, drunken blowjobs, walking along pearl, riding up to his house with 4 dogs in the backseat of the car, at gamelan, having christmas, picking out a kitten, picking out a ring, being a mess, playing with the kitten, being happy, being sad, being squashed together in stevos car in the middle of summer, freezing at a bus stop, messing around in my bed, talking on the phone every day for hours and hours and hours...   i could go on for hours and hours, but i wont...there are people at my house.   I love you, dylan.   ~abby
