Leave a message, b.) write me an e-mail, or c.) rip off all your clothes and run around the block naked yelling "BOOGA BOOGA BOOGA."  While this may not help you get a message to me any sooner, you will quickly meet some very nice, understanding people in white coats who will be happy to listen to you.
