I was so pissed because *Simple Plan* is gonna be on tv like 7 million times this next week and a half and my satillite dish was blown over from the wind storm! Ugh!! I was like oh shit. So my and my dad spent like a day and a half getting a signal and a good location to mount it, but I'm alright that I lost my whole weekend because I'd do anything to see them on tv over and over.... no pun intended...ha ha sorry I'm in one of my corny moods I guess......
