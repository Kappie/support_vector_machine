No worries on her mind. Well, I feel kind of bad because she got neutered, but oh well, she didn't need sex anyways, right? I like my cat. My cat's my favorite. Sorry shimmy. Cocoa could kick your ass anyday.  I'm such a loser. I need more interesting things to write about. My cat and dog just aren't going to cut it.
