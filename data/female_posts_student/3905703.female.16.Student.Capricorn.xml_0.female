Then,picked up a fight, was rude to almost everybody and missed Sinha's debate (by 3 mins,when I reached the AVH, Akash's had just finished, really frustating). Well, it should have been a nice day, as it was the BIRTHDAY of one of my very good friend's (Kanika's ).   So I think I will just wish Kanika a very   HAPPY BIRTHDAY..        A good thing which has happened in quite a few days,other than India winning the match against the Lankans, is that Mukesh Sir is back, which has been a blessing. I mean we have a Computers MT next week , and it was becoming quite a pain to have different teachers, who literally taught us nothing.    Coming to the match, I think Dada showed immense captaincy. And I am not saying that becoz he is a fellow Bengali. Whenever he made a bowling change,there was always a wicket taken. And though before the last ball, he was biting his nails and changing field positions at the last moment, the way he exulted after winning the match was a sight to be seen. The most unfortunate of things is that i have Fiitjee on Sunday, when they play the finals.   I really hope they win the finals, it will make themsupreme in Asia .
