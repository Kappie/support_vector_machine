Today in the mail I received this letter:   Dear Stefanie,  CONGRATULATIONS! You have been selected in the Arboretum Foundation's July drawing to receive a complementary Individual level Foundation Membership (valid for one year), four issues of the  Bulletin  horticulture magazine and one copy of  Cuttings Through the Year  - a $50.00 value.   I actually volunteer at the Arboretum so I already get the gift shop discount but I also scored 2 tickets to the Japanese Garden and a free plant from the greenhouse. I'll always take something for nothing :D Well, if you count my 50 hours of volunteering as "nothing".   Anyway, winning stuff makes my day. I slept in longer than I wanted to so I didn't get as much of my site done as I wanted. But I spent literally hours on the  urlLink charm bracelet page  (under Half Crazy).   Season finale of  Ashlee  tonight :D I've given up on most reality shows, but I'm hooked on this one. Tis my guilty pleasure of the summer!
