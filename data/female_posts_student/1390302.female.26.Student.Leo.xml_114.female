It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves." ~William Pitt (1759-1806)   Matt and I are members of the NRA, everyone who knows us knows that.  We support gun rights, given by the second amendment, for law-abiding Americans.  This is seemingly the only freedom that is still allotted to Americans with limited restriction -unless you count the Clinton "Semi-Automatic Gun Ban."  Democrats and liberal lobbiests, such as the Million Mom March, work every day to take away our right to "Bare Arms."   In the words of the slightly radical Charleton Heston, Chairman of the NRA, "They can have my gun when they pry it out of my cold dead hand!"  My right to bear arms is, in my humble opinion, my most important right.  By law, a gun is an extention of one's personal property. A firearm cannot be taken away from its registered owner in a divorce, separation, or the like.  A gun is personal to it's owner and cannot be forcibly taken away -save in the circumstance that it's been used for a crime.    That rant being said, there is a group led by the liberal Donna Dees-Thomases, the Million Mom March.  This rally is held on Mothers Day at the mall at Washington D.C.  It has been held for the second year this year and it was a sad excuse for a rally, weighing in at a dismal 2,000 women (though Dees-Thomases claims 3,000).  This group of women should be ashamed of themselves, hiding behind the claim that they want to protect their children!  I'm sorry but that's the biggest lie I've ever heard.  These liberal activists and poor excuses for mothers, hide behind a lie and skulk around Washington trying to undermine the rights of card-carrying, law-abiding American citizens who have a right to bear arms by the very constitution, given us by our founding fathers, the framers of the constitution.  Still the dismal turn out is, as Mark A. Chestnut, editor of 1st Freedom (NRA magazine) has pointed out, is 997,000 short of coming anywhere near it's bold claim of "Million Moms."  For shame, for shame!  It does my heart good to see this, maybe the world is not going to hell in a hand basket after all, maybe...  It just hurts me to see that the opinion of our country is so low by liberals.  One liberal man, whom attended the MMM, Dick Berman said "If we had our druthers, [America] would be like England or Australia or other civilized countries."    What an IDIOT!  England is a Socialism and while that is sadly the direction America seems to be going, we aren't there yet.  If you want to live in a socialism, go live in England Dick, we will not be missing you.  I just wish sometimes we could send all the idiots to the Moon, or England, or somewhere.  The world would be a better place!  ~Kristyn
