Just a stranger or more like a friend who calls on the phone every night. And not even a best friend at that. Get this. He even accused my mom of using me. She's just been peacemaker between me n my father. If it was my choice, he wouldn't have been at my honors convocation. He wouldn't have been at my choir banquet. But now my mom has told me she won't interfere and try to get me to do things with him *yay*. But still, if anyone is using me, it's him. I'm the comeback for him. It sucks. When I mentioned my Fathers Day gift @ the party, ppl were like that's just harsh. All I had to say was if you only knew. If they only knew the hells I've been through because I come from a broken home and I have a father who is an ass. So that's why "Emotionless" by Good Charlotte is fitting. Not to mention that my emotions ARE whacked. I'm better off with just my mom even though that's kinda hard sometimes. We argue constantly, but everyone pretty much knows that. We do have our good times though. Example: My mom and me raided Garden Ridge yesterday and we had a hell of a time with this red fuzzy lamp shade that made an excellent hat. She was freakishly *gulp* like a goofy friend. But the next second we were arguing about something...go figure lol. I gave both my parents warning that once I start driving, I'm not gonna b around much to listen to their crap. Not that my dad would know or care. He's at his apartment or at the homewrecker's even though the homewrecker is really Jeremy or Walgreens. *lame excuses papa. even i could do better.* And I also warned them that after high school, I'm gonna move out ASAP for "college purposes." I can only hope it's somewhere at least 5 hours away. I'm tired of bitchin to the world...I'm out for now...
