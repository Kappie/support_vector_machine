Yes there are the special people who do fall in love at 16 and get married and live happily ever after but seriously i dont think the percentage of this happening is very high, good luck if you believe you are in love at this age and i hope it does work out, i am only giving my personal view that the word has lost its special touch and is becomming less meaningfull.
