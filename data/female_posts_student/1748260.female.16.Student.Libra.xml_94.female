There's something bout the way your lips invite,  maybe it's the way that i get nervous when your around.  And I want you to be mine and if u need a reason why,   It's in the way that you move me,  and the way that you tease me the way that I want you tonight,  it's in the way that you hold me,  and the way that you know me,  when I can't find the right words to say,  u feel it in the way, you feel it in the way.  There's something 'bout how you stay on my mind,  there's something 'bout the way that I whisper your name  when I'm asleep Oh no.  Maybe its the look you get in your eyes.  Oh baby its the way that makes me feel to see you smile.  And the reasons they may change but what i'm feeling stays the same.  It's in the way that you move me,  and the way that you tease me the way that I want you tonight,  it's in the way that you hold me,  and the way that you know me,  when I can't find the right words to say,  u feel it in the way, you feel it in the way.  I can't put my fingers on just what it is  that makes me love you, you baby.  So don't ask me to describe,  I get all choked up inside,  just thinking 'bout the way.  It's in the way that you move me,  and the way that you tease me the way that I want you tonight,  it's in the way that you hold me,  and the way that you know me,  when I can't find the right words to say,  you feel it in the way, you feel it in the way.
