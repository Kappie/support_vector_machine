Ha what fun for me...Yes well I was finnaly enjoying the slience after posting when the children burst in the door in a grove bearing a rented x-box...which is noisey and I hate already...I was very comfortable sewing in my chair in the family room where the big screen is, which they insisted on using, and so i just drownd them out with my I pod which worked other then the fact that I was forced to listen to my Good Charotte cd because I needed something guitarish to drown them out sucessfuly. and along with drownding out the children i drowned out my mother! Which really made me happy because she is getting on my nerves...massively...and I realised that she never leaves...and it makes me mad...At least my dad has been home and has been occupying her with house stuff...but the boredom has set in since Paul has been grounded for the weekend and i am left with no other people who are as pathetic as myself to talk to...they all have lives...grrrrrr on them...I'm gonna call him tomorrow and hopefully break the monotony of our insanley boring lives...And gotta see if we can do something on a random day... I start working on monday...steady babysitting job that is...5$ an hour for one of Brit's friends and his two siblings...the other details of this job are unknown because my mom was the one who talked to this lady who will be my employer...But hey it's money which i need...I am still conning myself into thinking that I'm gonna have a car soon. My mom has been making an endless loop of excuses from keeping for even going so far as to actually go to the dealership if only to look. Ha what a proposterous idea! But there has to be some magical way to find a good used car! Maybe it will just drive up someday! How could looking even make sence? Bah...evil her...i want her to go away but she won't...damn...yet agian the hope of the car sustains me...Hum....more paragraph writing! i love it...it makes me feel complete...and slightly less pissed, depressed and bored! Ha it's a wonderful life...ha ha ha ha ha ha ha....
