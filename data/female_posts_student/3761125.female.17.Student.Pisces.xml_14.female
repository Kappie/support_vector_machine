The thing with it though is, I have very high expectations and I've been reading various reviews of it and well... it's said to be very full of itself.  And that it's good but could be better.  BLAH!  I'll see it for myself and then I'll make up my mind.  I really hope it doesn't disappoint though, I've been looking forward to it since January.  This movie looks really, really good:   You know when a song hits you so hard it gives you goosebumps?  Well music does that for me as well as movies... the preview for this movie did it.  It looks really interesting and though I'm not the biggest fan of Will Smith, he seems to have done a good job.  So we'll see!  HMV still haven't called... it's only been two days though... *calm* Oh well.  It they don't call this week, I'll apply to some other record stores... and possibly a couple cafes.    Yesterday, I got Porcupine Tree's  In Absentia  in the mail off of amazon.  This album is truly incredible.  They take progressive rock to a new level.  I found out about them through liking Opeth and I can see some similarities... but definitely more differences.  Anyway, I want to write a lot more about this album but I'm lazy, I only woke up 20 minutes ago (1:30 pm) and I'm still dead.  later.
