However, my dad is to stubborn to open his eyes and realize how badly he's messed us up, then again I'm not even sure stubborn is a good word to put there.  It's really hard to go from having everything you wanted or needed, then one day someone robs your home while your whole family is sleeping. It ruins your trust in people - Forever. Instead of being wiser about what happened, my father packed what was left of our lives and moved us an hour away from our family and friends. After this all he did was work - We rarely saw him and when we did he was probably pissed off and yelling or sleeping on the couch.  Of course, life never got better but we were living in a beautiful neighborhood. But what did that matter? 3 years later his business went down the drain due to....   1 ~ Driving an hour an half to work. 2 ~ Stopped listening to my mom when it came to business. 3 ~ LIED, LIED, and LIED.  By the time, my mom figured out how bad business was - it was to late for her to even try to save it. A year later we were living in Tennesse with no house, no water, no electric - Nothing but everything we owned in rubbermaid tubs. What a fucking joke that was, no wonder all of us are messed up. Dad had this screwed up idea that if he built the barn first - Business would come pouring in and sadly that's never happened because he lies, he makes up stories, he doesn't listen, and he never finishs what he starts unless its something he wants.  It's been 11 years since we moved here and still so many promises that were never keep and never will be. They're still living in the apartment that was built for us to live in until the house magically got built and yet I don't even think he cares if it does or doesn't but really at this point - what the hell is the difference?   I know its not right to blame your parents for your fucked up life.... but hell who's fault is it in this mess? who dragged us away from our lives so many times? who promised us stuff and never allowed it to happen? It wasn't my mother because she always tried to make the best for us despite what was happening and now it's like she doesn't even try or care anymore.  I can go on and on with this subject and I'm not really sure what brought it all to the surface. I guess the fact I'll be in Michigan in less then a month - seeing all my family, which I don't even want to see due to realizing how screwed up we look to them.   It's like I've been able to sit back and watch what was going on and I've just been to blind to see it until now. I just wish I had the nerve to sit down with my brothers and see what they say about this topic because even there messed up. Brian's been in trouble with drugs, John's a drunk, and then there's me that turned to food and became really fat. Ugh. Apparently, we all have our choice of drugs.
