I have three tests, the math, the chem, and the chem re-write.  I didn't know that I could stuff that much knowledge in my brain at once.  And well I am really worried about how I did on that math test because I just lost my focus and concentration through it.  I wasn't scared or nervous or panicked for a math test for once and I think it kind of had a negative effect.  Kind of strange isn't it?  And well I am not sure how I did on that chem test.  I am sure the re-write went fine but for the actual test I just totally got confused.  I tried to understand stuff though, I really did try and I do feel really bad.  I always ask her over and over how to do things.  I feel like I I probably can get annoying sometimes, and it does may me feel bad because I never seem to understand alot of things.  She was nice today though, very nice.  She is always nice actually, I KNOW that she really did want to help me understand.  She even asked me how the test went, and like she has NEVER done that.  And then she was like "some day you will understand."  I sure hope some day I understand, but well with math I didn't get it ever as a kid and it's still hard, so lets just pray that she is right.  I WON'T give up my dream of teaching Bio no matter how hard I have to work to understand and no matter how things may be for me.
