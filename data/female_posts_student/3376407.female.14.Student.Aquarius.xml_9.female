Which means I have to miss Rivi swim team. :( We ( gus )won the last swim meet, though as I said before we knew we'd win. And even though almost all of our older swimmers weren't there, we still won by like 300 points. :)  Ellie  Quote:  "When it comes time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song, and die like a hero going home." - Tecumseh
