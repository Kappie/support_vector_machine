It's so easy to tell other people to do things but when you realize that you, yourself should be doing them...it's a completely different story.  Anyway, I thought it was kind of funny today. We had an, "all secure, take cover" drill. Now, they're sitting there telling us if something's wrong then we should all hide so that no one can see us through the windows from the doors of the classroom. I find this funny because the most potent threat is probably somebody actually in our school and they're probably going to realize, "oh, they're trying to make it look like there is no one in the classroom." Ah, intelligent minds.  I'm excited for the weekend to come. Once it does, I basically have a week off because finals are no big deal for me and I never actually study. YaY!   OK, sleep time or something now. Good night cow jumping over the moon...   ~~~~It's all waiting if you keep believing.~~~~
