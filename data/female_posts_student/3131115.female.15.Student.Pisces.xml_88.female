For a while I've been having feelings about my ex-boyfriend Justin...thoughts of being with him and not William. Everytime that I was with Bill, I was thinking about Justin and my stomach would hurt whenever I was around him. So..I told him. I sat down with him and told him everything, about how I was still thinking about Justin and how part of me wanted to be with him. Bill was very good about it actually, and it ended up being a great day in the end. I dont want to really get into details..just that I told Bill that I couldnt be with him anymore, and then I realized how much Bill is there for me and how much that Justin couldnt be. I left Justin messages on yahoo, (which bill told me NOT to do) but I did..I had to, and I'm glad that I did..because now I feel so much better about being with Bill. Justin and I talked this morning before Bill came over, and he told me that I've changed too much and that I'm not the girl for him anymore. I have a feeling that he was saying this because he wanted to make it easier for me...because when he left he was like "whatever"when I told him goodbye. I told him that I knew now that he would always hold a grudge because I changed...that no matter what, he would always be wishing that I was who I used to be. I believe it now. It's so hard for me though, because..I'll still always think of him as who he was and who I was before he left. I was happy with him, and I'll always remember that...my mind wont ever let me think of the bad things about him. Although, I'm happy with Bill now..we had a very short, but tremendously great day.  Now this brings me to *you*..I miss you. I'm really really thinking about asking Bill to let me talk to you now since Bill and I can actually talk without flipping out on eachother. Our relationship is so much better now. *sigh*, I really want to talk to you. Just our hellos and goodnights meant so much to me. I know that we didnt talk much, and when we did it was all random, but I cherish the random shit. I cherish our memories...Every time I look at my bed I think about you. It hurts..a lot, but I'm getting through it. I had so many great times with you, and you were one of the BEST friends that I've ever had...even better than Cierra, and Cierra was the best. So pretty much besides Bill, you were my best friend. I wish we had had more times to hang out and such. I wish that I could promise Bill that nothing would happen between us if we hung out, because maybe then he'd let us hang out. But anyway...  I dont know what else to write about.I guess there really isn't anything to say anymore. I know that it makes me so jelous when *you* talk about your friends in your posts. It hurts, because I dont have anyone. I'm not even kidding..I haven't hung out with anyone except for my cousin this summer..and that was only twice. I have no friends..and I miss having friends. *sigh*..oh well. You deserve to have friends...you deserve everything.   "The Street Lights Flicker Like This Match In My Hand(x3)..
