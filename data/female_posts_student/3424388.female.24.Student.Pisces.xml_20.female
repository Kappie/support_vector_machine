Enter  urlLink Mozilla's Firefox .  Life will never be the same.  With Firefox's tabs, I can have a seemingly limitless number of pages open at the same time!  I believe this has been the highlight of my week.  I must get out more.  So where's all this anti-Microsoft sentiment coming from?  Actually, I'm not anti-Microsoft.  I think it's going to be great fun to kick back and watch Microsoft squirm.  I had to do an analysis, and a rather pathetic one, of Mr. Softy this week in order to wrap up yet another management course, so I've had open source on the brain for the last week.    I'm a tech idiot (I'm learning, but it's slow going), but I'm seriously thinking about putting  urlLink OpenOffice  and, gasp!, running Linux on my next laptop.  I think there's some significance here - we may be approaching one tipping point (sorry to have to go and through that antiquated buzzword out) for the open source movement.  Given the recent IE news, I imagine others like me, the mildly-tech-inclined, will be throwing in the towel and looking for alternatives.  I'd always know of Mozilla, and a few years ago I think I briefly used a Mozilla browser, but the company's browsers never seemed like a viable alternative for me b/c I always thought I was too stupid to use them.      And, anthropologically speaking, I have recently become fascinated by the open source movement.  Not to get all mushy, but it gives me, almost, hope for the world.  It's really unprecedented, such large groups working together.  How does it all work?  And why does it work?
