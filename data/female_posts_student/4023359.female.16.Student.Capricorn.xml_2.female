I talked to Marla yesterday and I told her that I had to make enough in two weeks time to make a car payment every month, she said that she would see what she could do.  It just makes me mad when Jay knows that I have more then one free day.  I can work Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays...but does he schedule me for all three of those days? NO...he schedules me 10 hours in one Saturday.  GRRRR!  I work today...unscheduled, however.  Since I was saying that I'm not getting enough hours, Marla asked me to come in today from 2pm until 10pm.  Only 8 hours...not gonna be that bad.  I actually get to work a night at the Hartselle store.  whoo-hoo!!  Okie, well I've gotta go~ got some homework to do before work...so buh-byes
