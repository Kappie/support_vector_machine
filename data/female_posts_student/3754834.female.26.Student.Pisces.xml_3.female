Neither of which I did especially well on... sigh.  But serendipity came to visit on Tuesday.  I studied all weekend to get caught up on calculus.  Even though my professor is a thrilling lecturer, I dreaded going to that class.  Why?  Because I was so lost and behind I was afraid to be called on.  I did manage to perfect my ability to sink slowly down in my seat and shrivel up into a tiny point on the continous function in the space of my academic career.  I can take the derivative of my happy ass... but I sure can't seem to integrate it.  Tom would be proud of my slight physics/calculus reference.  But I digress...  Serendipity... I found myself with a quiz in cell bio on Tuesday, and I couldn't pick out cellular respiration from a police lineup and I wasn't going to have any time to study... or was I?  My cell bio lecture ended 45 minutes early, so I had an hour to read the chapter.  Then my genetics lecture started and 15 minutes into it... the fire alarm was pulled, so I had another hour and a half.  Then calculus let out early.  So I ended up with almost three and half hours of study time thrown into my lap as a gift.  I aced the quiz... my ego got stroked and I made the executive decision to cut back on the classes I take next session.  Then I found out I had more money than I thought, so I got to eat sushi for dinner.  Then I went to physics, only to find out Tom, my instructor, had to finish moving... soo.... class was cancelled.  So I went home and slept.  Yay!    But then... blood sugar mayhem ensued and I couldn't remember ANYTHING for the next two days and subsequently performed abysmally on my two exams.  Then I picked up a screw in the tire I just replaced two months ago.  My donut is in shambles so I am relagated to wedging the screw into the tread and airing up the tire on a daily basis and putting out a contract with divinity- please oh please oh please don't go flat on meeeeeee.... in the middle of the ghettooo... oh pretty please!!  But I did get to play with acid at work- washing sampling bottles for the cave and creek project I'm on.  Yes, working in the clean lab is not exactly exciting, but I do get to make a fashion statement.  I don on my mushroom hat and matching psuedo paper/fabric lab coat and go into a pressurized room  and look important for a couple of hours  :)    In other wonderful news, I managed to keep my car from getting repo'd this month and got a contract extension on my payments to get me caught up.  This car has been the bane of my existance for the last 4 years, and I'm not about to let the unfortunate coincidence of me lacking money to get in the way of my owning it!  In some other not so earth shattering but definitely seismic activity news... CAKE is coming to the Austin music festival in September!!!  Now I have to figure out who to make my new best friend to get a ticket to the Sunday performance.  I really haven't done anything fun for myself in over a year.  So, in the spirit of being less crabby and hermit-like, I've decided that going to see CAKE will be an excellent start.
