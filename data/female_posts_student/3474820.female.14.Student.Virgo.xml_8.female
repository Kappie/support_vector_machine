So sexy...uhh and now I am in school and its Wednesday and I am a free man. It's time to party it up ^_^. Talked to Lauren yesterday...she grounded. I am going to give up talking to her because she goes to centrevill too much and she prolly gots someone down thurr so imma just keep it pimpin. (I decided this last nite). I missed the bus this morning and im so fuckin hungry but that spanish bitch in the lunch line keeps fuckin up my money and I am super pissed. O well...pce!!!
