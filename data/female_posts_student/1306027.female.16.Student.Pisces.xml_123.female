I bought a new shirt and a new purse. Now, I'm not really a purse person but I kinda had to much crap to keep sticking it all in my pockets so I really had to get a purse. This doesn't change the boyish-slack figure that I have, it just means that I have a purse. So stop with the jokes already! Geeze.  Yea, so, I got to drive my mom on up to walmart early, where we shopped, and then I drove her back home.   After that time kinda blurred together and the next thing I knew I was at work. Work was a "blast" as always. I got in there today and a lot was already done. I was happy, and then I realized that there wasn't much for me to do. Then I got anxious... and then I started doing really weird stuff, like cleaning inside all the cabinets and in the microwave and such.. Crap I don't normally do unless there is absolutely nothing to do. Kara worked tonight. She was gonna leave early but Keith didn't want her too so she didn't. That made me happy. I was glad Kara stayed.  Righto. Well, that's all I have to post about tonight other than I thought I should let you know that I have 2 new links on here now. They are too my  urlLink photo center  and my  urlLink guestbook . I expect ya'll to visit both, and sign the guestbook. It's the least you could do ;-)
