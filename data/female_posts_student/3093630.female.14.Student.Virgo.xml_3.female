Yeah, but seriously... the I haven't seen the sun in two damn days and have been in a "Don't talk to me or I'll bitch at you" type mood since then.   Today... was long. I can't really say why... mostly because "z" kept talking about how she thinks "y" is totally checking her out. Guess what babe, I told him. He's not... So, Z, do me a favor and get over it because it's just annoying. Y isn't even that hot. I don't know, that's just my opinion. Personally, I think that "Q" is better. And, for all you who are wondering, that's not d.s.... this guy actually has a personality :)   Z was seriously annnnoyying me today! "Darcy's flirting"... "Oh Darcy, you're so funny ::insert fake laugh here:: Whoops, I didn't know you were talking to the boys"...  OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT- IF ITS SUCH A FUCKING BIG DEAL TO YOU THAT I TALK TO THE GUYS, FINE, YOU TALK TO THEM. I JUST TALK TO THEM SO I DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR DRAMA SHIT! From now on I won't keep boys as friends, haha... yeah right. Z, get over yourself.   Aiii... I either need the summer, or a big party, ASAP. Haha, but you know what- Saturday I get one of those.   I think I gotta go chill. Haha, heyyyyyyy... whats-his-name just blocked me... guessss whatttt... i. am. over. you... have been for a while.... At least make it less obvious next time. Guess you were too busy masterbating to actually think about the least obvious way to do things... ahhahaha, noooooo offense.  I gotta go studyyyyy Ciao... XOxXOOO *~*Darcy*~*   SHAKE it UP
