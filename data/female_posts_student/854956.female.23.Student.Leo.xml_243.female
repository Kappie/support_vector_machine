And being a creature of habit I, apparently, locked the handle of the door from the house to the garage. :-\ Ooops. Okay, my parents went to Kerrville to my G-ma's... yeah. So, I had no way back inside. I began brainstorming. "Mom keeps that window to the patio room cracked open. I'll pop the screen off and get into the house that way..." Yeah, I made it through the window (a feat I am very proud of, considering I'm not a size 5 and the window is about 5 feet off the ground... it's just lucky for me that I'm flexible) but the door from the patio room to the house was... yes, that's right... locked. So, I decided at this point, "well, I'll just jump through the other window from the patio room to the house..." yeah, it had a stick keeping it from being opened all the way. So, I then went back to the garage and began looking for something thin enough to stick in the door and pry the thing open. I found a screwdriver... that one didn't work. I looked for a smaller one... and that did. In all, it took me about 10 minutes to break into the house 2 times and attempt breaking into the house 2 times. I should break into houses for extra money! :-) haha Anyhow, the dog's nice and clean, and I've run 2 loads of laundry... I'm really feeling accomplished today (so far)!
