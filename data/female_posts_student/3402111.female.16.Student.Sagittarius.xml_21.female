He was about the age of the modern teengager's father, but had the body of the average teenage girl's boyfriend.  And in our early wake up aerobic, Scotty said that what ever you expend you will recieve back.  Of course he was talking about exercise, but couldn't it apply to life in general?  No, really.  This may seem kinda dorky, but when it is considered it makes a tad bit of sense.  See, if you are happy and concerned, then those qualities will somewhat rub off on those around you and they will be happy and caring, too.  Maybe.  Because, that is how it works in band.  If the leaders are psyched and engergetic, then the section picks up a bit of that chagre and become energized themselves.   Yeah, band talk.  But band definitely has its good points, even if we all have to wake up mondo early and stay there uber late.  (hah, I used "mondo" and "uber")  But we have now finished the first hard week.  Things are going to ease up in difficulty, if we mantain our spirits.    Tomorrow i get to see a couple of my friends that I haven't seen in a bit.  Now, of course a bit may not be that great amount of time, but I am looking forward to seeing them.  Yeah, I am out of topics, and I know it has been a lil bit since i wrote in here last.... but I am out of stuff to talk about.... (shrug)
