Little did I know that in just thinking it was only my uncles house and decided to dress nappily, there were boys there...Oops! Oh well, they'll be seeing plenty of me on other days when I'm sexy as hell...lolz ;) And of course I went to go see FIREWORKS!!! It's so cool, every year we go over to these people's house and lay on the lawn and watch fireworks as the come toward our faces...or at least that what it seems like. It's very cool. I watched in awe while getting attacked at the stomach by Brandon...my adorable and sometimes annoying baby cousin. We also bought the "TNT package" for 50 friggin' dollars!! ahhh! But they had these sparkler things or whatever, and it was like a strobe light. Well, the point of my story is that my dad and I started doing the robot. lolz... We had an audience too of like 30 people...good times good times. Hardy har har. When we got home, of course, we had a snack because we're fat like that...lolz. FOOD IS GREAT! So here I am...bored off my arse. I think I'm going to breakfast tomorrow with Sam and Jenn. Yummay! Till later toots!  P.S. Alex is taking me out on July 6th partially because that's when he can legally drive others and partially because i told him he is...and he's my bitch. ;) lolz..J/k I love ya! XOXO
