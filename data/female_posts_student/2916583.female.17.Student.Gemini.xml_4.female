President - Kim (I didn't vote for her, but she's going to bring back the Key/Keyette sleepovers, so that's good) Vice President - Lindsey (yay!) Secretary - Lauren (yay!) Treasurer - Shaheen (yay!) Historian - Paige (ran uncontested) Chaplain - Melissa :(  Most of the people I voted for won, which is good.   Hooray for a straight haircut!  My mom evened it yesterday.  Today I flipped it out and curled the end, and I don't look like my grandmother!!!  Yay!   Tip: When wearing skirts for a week straight, make sure to shave one's legs (unless you're a guy...that's not only fruity, that's weird).   Anyway, today's an even day, which means journalism, math analysis test I didn't study for, yearbook, and English test I didn't study for.  Well I can study for math analysis during journalism, English during math analysis, lunch and yearbook.  If you must choose between math and English, always, always, ALWAYS study for English.  That's a tip.   Well, I need to study for English, so I'm going to end this hand-crippling typing.  I'm probably gonna have arthritis because of this.  Later.    You are going to marry Orlando Bloom. He will always treat you right and is very romantic. He will do anything for you. He is very polite and has deep brown eyes and is very good looking (which is another plus!). He can make anything cheesy look really hot(like sliding down stairs on a shield shooting arrows or wearing pointy ears for example). Congrats!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry? (now 12 (i just added more, and still more to come!)results that have pics!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    In your face, Julie Ann!!!
