We had subs and stuff... lol then we played air hockey and pool and had the cake that my dad had baked for my mom for her birthday but because she felt really crappy on her birthday we didn't bring it for her.. plus she cant eat foods so we brought it and we ate that which was yummyness.  Then because my brother was being an ass I had to take the dog for a walk even though it's his turn to take her, plus I have to take her for a long walk tomorrow during the day because no one else is going to be home...but then again that can be a good thing because I'll have the house all to myself for most of the day and I can do basically whatever I want to do.   I'm debating whether to call chad.. because it's really likely that hes biking and I don't want to call him when hes biking. And if he was home he would probably be on the computer which would mean he would be on MSN which he isn't. Meh I wont... I don't wanna see like I have to call him all the time, if he wants to talk he'll call me, and if he doesn't well then he wont call... which no... it doesn't bug me.. well it does to the extent that I would like to talk to him but he yeah I don't know... It's another one of those things that make sense in my head but not when I try and put them into words.  So tomorrow I really should clean my room... I didn't exactly do that today... meh.. if the oppertunity comes to do something more interesting I aint cleaning lol.   Apparently I'm going to see the third happy potter on friday with a bunch of people... hmm I don't know, could be fun though... better than sitting at home and doing nothing thats for sure. But with my luck I'll commit to that and it will be the one day that Chad will be free to do something... but he has to know that I'm not free all the time and I aint going to drop everything for him just because he's my boyfriend... Plus he certainly doesn't do that for me.   Yesterday Meredith's grandma had her 75th birthday and yeah it was at Meredith's house and some lady said to Meredith about this really ugly pot that she like loved it and if she could buy it off of Meredith! And she asked Meredith how much to buy it and Meredith was like... I donno um maybe 5 bucks? And the lady paid for it... I wanna do that! lol.. make money off of some of the pots I make! That would be so awesome! And it's not like I need all the pots.. It's not even close to needed them all.. I don't even like use them, they're basically for decoration pretty much... And then theres the really ugly ones that end up in the box in my closet but that's okay! At least I don't make as many ugly pots anymore.. they're getting wayyy better!
