I talked to some other people and they said it was a mad house this morning, but that was probably because of the people trying to score extra tickets. I have to remember to keep my mouth shut about the possibility of having an extra ticket! I let it slip in front of my presentation partner, but I told her that I wasn't sure yet if it really was available. I think maybe Jason can go with Lisa, so that'll take them. So it's Mom, Alex, Catherine, Jerm, Lisa and possibly Jason. My dad'll be on a cruise to Alaska so can't come. I'm still a little bitter. I need to find out who is where when. And I need to get my announcements out. I bought the sticker seals today that I'll use as a decoration on the pages. I think it should turn out nicely. Oh, and I need to remember that I owe Liz money for the paper and envelopes! I'm not sure how much, we need to do some math together.
