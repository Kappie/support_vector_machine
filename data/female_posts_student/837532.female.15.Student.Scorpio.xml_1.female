Tormented Thoughts…    Crying My tears run like a never ending river They form of pain and hurt everlasting They are the blood of my wounded soul  Needing I’m lost and confused Wishing for someone to come hold me tight Tell me everything will be ok  Hurting My open wounds are rotting I’m torn apart like a thousand stabbing knives The pain is never-ending like the constant flow of my blood  Wanting My heart yearns to be filled with love My soul wishes to wash away the years My self being looks for a way to survive  In a world that doesn’t want anything to do with it  Ending Death can seem the only way out But in the end is it really? Is there a true end to the beginning Or does the cycle just go on…
