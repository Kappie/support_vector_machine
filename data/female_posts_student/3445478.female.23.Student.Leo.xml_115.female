Wednesday I took Nick to a park for the 1st time and he fell asleep in the swing! How cute. Nick has discovered his love for books! He loves to eat anything and everything he can get his quick little hands on! Especially if it's in your hands! Back to the Dr Appt...Nick is in the 99% for height, 98% for weight and 97% for head....SO to all who have teased Nick for being overly plump...Mom and Keely...Ha! He's on the more skinny side of being porportionate. ;) The shots went well. Nick cried but as soon as they were over, he stopped crying.-Because I gave him a bottle with sugar water right before and after the shots. He was very sleepy all Wednesday and Wed night into Thursday.  urlLink
