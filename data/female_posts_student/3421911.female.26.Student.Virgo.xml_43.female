Jessica Zafra, she gets to be on tv, radio, print media. she writes well, she's brilliant.  the only mean thing i think that she's had to live with is the fact her parents waited too long for her to arrive that when she was finally born, they actually thought she wasn't human (i got this info from one of her books).  other than that, what's her excuse?  i had a dream when i was younger.  i said that these people can think less of me all they want but their kids will be reading my shit  :)
