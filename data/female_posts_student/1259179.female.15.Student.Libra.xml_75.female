When you listen to the words, they actually get inside your skin and stir up your soul.  Well I am not in a good place and it's been a quite a while.  I am feeling pulled down and down and can't seem to get out of it.    I chatted with an old friend today and he, again, put a smile on my face.  It has been a long time since I giggled out loud.    Thanks Buddy, you are very special to me..  Keep being my friend    Anyways, I will check in my bed now and hope for a better tomorrow so..........Be Good
