Well, I'm really bored right now.  What is with people trying to get people against me? They're dumb. First of all, if you're going to tell people about all the horrible stuff that I do, make sure it's true. But...I don't care. People can say what they want. If you want to give me some bad rep, have a blast! Because actually...I find it amusing. LoL. And if you really really hate me, and you want me to back up my rep, hey I'd be glad to help you out! Haha...just kidding. I mean, I know I'm very far from perfect...no one needs to point it out to the world...everyone has their flaws. Big deal. Alright, that's all! Au revoir!
