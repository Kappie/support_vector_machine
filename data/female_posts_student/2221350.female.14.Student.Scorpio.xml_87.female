I find that lately I'm having to prioritize... a lot. So between school, homework, guitar, cat, chores, grooming((which, suprisingly enough, seems to require a fair amount of my time)), Sims and the occasional social outing, blogging has moved down my list of super necessary things.   So the good news is you only have to stop by once a week and the blog will now be less about my life in detail and more about stuff I think about((which is ok since my life is pretty boring anyways)). I do hope you all leave comments though, because I am the comment whore and I love the little notes I find lying around here.  I've noticed lately that the blogging community has slumped. People are writing less, reading less. All the energy has moved to the other side of the world. The balance is wrong, I don't feel level. Nothing seems to be happening, but it is, but we don't really notice, so it doesn't get acknowledged and it's soon forgotten. But then someone notices, someone who remembers to make notes, and then it gets written down, even if it has typos, BIG typos. And then everyone who ignored it while it was happening hears about it some years later and says "I was there". They weren't really there... They remember it like they remember being born, it positively happened but the details aren't really clear.  It's nice to see how far I've come since I started the blog. Things are easier to put into words, paper isn't wasted, there's no tinge of aggravation in me, I have two voices.  This week was good. creepily good.   Tuesday morning we pulled out of the driveway and drove about 15 feet before mom got a phone call from Steven. He pulled the "we need to talk" card. Of course mom flipped, made a u-turn and scrambled back to the house to take a bath and get beautiful for steven's little "talk" with her. mammaw had a dentist appointment so she couldn't take me to school, mom was busy primping, so I got to stay home! I chilled at the house all morning and contemplated surfing for some internet porn, but instead I played Sims and ate more peeps. When mom got home she wasn't a wreck as I would have expected, she just seemed a little aggravated and amused at the same time. It turns out steven's wife has been feeling neglected in the bedroom and he and mom are gonna have to hold off on the sex((which is kinda what they do all the time)) until stevey can uh... Get it up for his wife.   Tuesday night we went and ate fried catfish with our uncle mike who is not really our uncle but you get the idea. I happen to hate fried catfish, but I managed to choke down a whole bunch, and it made uncle mike smile, and that's all that matters.  Wednesday I made it to school for the first half of the day but mom came and got me in 3rd hour and we went and had lunch with Steven. We didn't really discuss anything important except for the play Steven was going to on Saturday night. When he noticed our interest he got us tickets too. It was called the "Forbidden Broadway" and it was parodies of all these famous songs.  On Friday I bitch-kilt on the tennis court and then played bingo all night long. I lost the stupid bingo, again. ((I should seriously consider switching to video poker))  Saturday mom and I had some bonding time. We shopped for hours and hours and then that night we went to the Forbidden Broadway. I looked sooo pretty! My hair was all curly and I had the camel pants and the wraparound black shirt thing going on. The show was absolutely hysterical, and it poked fun at everything from the lion king to les miserables. Mom and I had a great time sneaking peaks at Steven and his family and singing all the showtunes on the way home.   While I'm thinking about it, I would like to express my concern about the current fashion situation in the department stores. Ok... WTF?!? Who the hell is designing this shit!?!?  Since when are pineapple-laden cut-offs attractive? Why would anyone wear electric blue and fushia together? Do ALL the dresses have to have safari animals printed on them? And most importantly of all, how could they forget that lime green is a color only to be worn by LIMES! FROM LIME TREES! These clothes! It's crazy! I didn't realize that there were so many middle-aged Baptist PTA women who wanna dress in colors not found in nature printed with things that are ONLY found in nature all over them! Ugh.  Something I just realized a minute ago: I don't read blogs like I used to. All those blogs on the list directly to your left, I only read about half of them. The rest are sad little things, the product of over-zealous linking and laziness on my part. Tonight I think I will chunk all those retarded links and only keep the ones I actually read.
