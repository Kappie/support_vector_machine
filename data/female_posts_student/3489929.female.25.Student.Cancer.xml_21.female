Without him, I may have given up a long time ago and crawled under a rock to live out the rest of my days as an unwashed hobo. I feel like the world's biggest ass for not telling him about my plans to move to MS.  Here's why. Tuesday morning, he pulled me into his office and told me that he was aware that I have been very unhappy the past several months (yes, I am that transparent) and offered me a raise and bonuses and other myriad little enticements to perk me up. And it did, and I performed accordingly the majority of the week, but at the same time, I am eaten alive with guilt.  God help me, I care about this man's opinion of me, and he has given me so many chances, he will think I am deliberately shitting on him (for lack of a better term) if I leave. And I really, really don't want that.  Do I tell him now? Do I tell him later? Do I never tell him, and change all of my plans, and put all my hopes and dreams for myself on hold, and stay here and work at this job for the rest of my life?  Should I stay, or should I go?
