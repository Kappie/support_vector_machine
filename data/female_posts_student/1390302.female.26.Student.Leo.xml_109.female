First, she dates a married dancer who's wife is expecting a baby and causes them to seperate.  Then she married Jayson Alexander, stays his wife 55 hours, and dumps him in a head spinning annulment.  After that, she dates another dancer, to whom she is now supposedly engaged, who has a two year old baby and a girl friend who is eight months pregnant.  Britney seems to be attracked to those guys with pregnant significant others.   I think she does it to get attention, what other explanation is there?  Either she is so stupid that she doesn't realize she's breaking up families, or she so cold hearted she doesn't care. I'm for stupid, but I am also for cold hearted.  From what I've seen, Britney is so self-centered that she can't see past her own ego.    She can sing, though what she chooses to sing leaves something to the imagination.  However, the talent to sing is really rather lowly in the grand scheme of the world.  Music is important, some people will be remembered, some won't.  She may be remembered for a while, but she's not so great as to be remembered forever.  She's todays Madonna, but she's not as good as Madonna, not as timeless as Madonna, and she won't age half as well as Madonna has!    Matt loves her, uh er...for her voice, yes, that's it, for her voice.  Personally I think shes a bit trashy.  She came from nowhere, has a little talent, and now she thinks she's the princess of the world and can do anything, moral or immoral.  Immoral is her middle name.  Someday, that uneducated, immoral, wench is going to get what's coming to her.  I hope the paparazzi catch it when it does, I'd love to see it.  Don't mistake me for unfeeling, I just do not approve of anyone who makes such a large show of ignorant stupidity.  The saddest part is that someday she's going to age and sag and get all gruffy, then where's she going to be.  She should hop off her high horse and go back to ninth grade.
