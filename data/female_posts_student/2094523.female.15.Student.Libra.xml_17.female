Im not making my self an exception im prolly a really big bitch too just like every other chick ive ever met. I mean girls are just so.. frustarating...they hold grudges, they get these moody things, theyre gossipy, arrogant, and thinks as tho the world evolves around popularity looks and clothes.. i mean it may..im not argueing with that.. but girls are just sucky friends. No matter what girls say they think the world evolves around them..so much for self absorbness. And to those chicks who know theyre extremely hot and know they can get any guys they want..fuck u.. those who break others hearts are bitches man i feel sorry for straight men... Whoever is reading this, trust me chicks are lame and annoying. hey guys may be too maybe everyone is but im not a guy so i have nothin to say against that..anywho bottom line is i hate girls..  was this a weird topic? prolly..but im weird so i guess it works out..
