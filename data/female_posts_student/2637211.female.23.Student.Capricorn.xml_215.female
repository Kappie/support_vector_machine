What I'm really beginning to freak out about is my paper tomorrow about the development of the republican party... I have to go to Catherine's high school graduation in the evening, which promises to be awkward. I'm just going to go early, get Catherine a present, then spend the afternoon sitting at my dad's writing... why won't I ever learn to give up procrastinating? I'll start tomorrow, really.
