Something about backpacks and Allen and stuff that we've both just put in the past. I guess my old relationship didn't help much. We went to Middle Earth and I got a new poetry book, headed back to the parking structure and hung out at my house for a few before I took him home and headed to work to do shit that was utterly boring. I don't think I got all three hours in, but oh well... it's spring break what do you expect?  After work I hung out with Keith at Pennisular Park and talked some more, seems to be doing some good. Read poetry. Went to my house.  Printed some stuff off for his Geometry (pah... Geometry) project. Dropped him off and went back home to chill and finish the layout on the Tasteful Lemon. Charlie came over before heading out to the Necto, did his make-up, made a Margaret Cho desktop background. Ate apples. Went to pick up Tiki and drove around EMU screaming at decent looking guys before dropping Charlie off at his car, fixing his hair, and then heading to A2 and Espresso Royale Cafe with Tiki for some live music, writing, and wonderful beverages. At 10:45pm we went back to my place and chilled for a few. Talked with my drunken brother and Nick.   Blah... I called my mom about head up here (Fiji) today, she bitched me out, I hung up the phone and rested my head on my keyboard before deciding to head out early this  morning (against my parent's best interests). Whatever, they'll get over it. Probably won't spend the night but I'm almost eager to get back home and get coffee. Not really. It's something to do, and I really don't have that many friends available to hang today. Michelle is probably passed out on her bed from the long drive back from Myrtle Beach. Did you whore it up? lol.   Not much else. Yesterday was a long day and I'm hoping the final days of my break will be just as long... beautiful, as usual.  Check out the Lemon, tell me how you like the site... I think the main iframe is busted.... *goes to check the source* the background is fucked and I need to center the smaller iframe... I'll fix it when I get back to Ypsi.
