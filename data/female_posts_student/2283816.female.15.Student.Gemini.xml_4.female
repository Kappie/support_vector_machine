The Saturday stuck during a particularly uninteresting homily on Friday, during which I was subconciously thinking about Saturday and WHY HASN'T IT COME YET. I needed an S! And it stuck! My real name, however, is Laura, which I do like - I just needed a change.   Blahbety BLAH... I love the idea of this blog thing. Unfortunately not much interesting stuff has happened today - I'm about ready to read Best Enemies by serenity sea - really good stuff there. And Alias last night??? So. Freaking. Awesome. And you know? If the angry mob of S/Vers covince JJ and Company to break up Lauren and Vaughn - I'm all for the Lark. Truly. That would be so awesome.   And here is the end of my first blog post - I'll look back and laugh. :)
