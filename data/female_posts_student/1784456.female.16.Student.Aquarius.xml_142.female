The reason that wars happen are differences of opinions or beliefs. Sad how people have no empathy and won't even try. Any way... about walking home! Well first my brother and his friend nabbed my polo's! Shock horror! Then I was walking across the field and the kids in the junior school started running across my path and I was like arrrgh! Then they turned so I was fine, but then I saw the person who I randomly talked to and a load of other people about to walk my way! So I had to half run to get there before them. Then I walked really slowly behind some one. Is it just me or does that sound really stupid? Let's just hope it's really stupid! Eh? I think some thing's gone to my brain cause I meant to put some thing else! Oh on a finishing note: Izzy, don't jump to conclusions!
