Not in a bad way though.  Definately  not in a bad way. Test in Alg 2....easy. Test in Chemistry...easy. Chair test in the hell band...easy. French...boring.  So then I came home and took a 2 hour nap. Oh it was lovely. I'm still recovering. From it's greatness. Gah...gotta love sleep. :)***  Yes, and now I'm horribly bored. So I am gonna find something to do.  Au revoir you crizazies.
