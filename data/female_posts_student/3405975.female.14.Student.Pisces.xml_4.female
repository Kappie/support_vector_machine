Hmmm, though Xanga is much, much, much, much more easier then blogger. >. again  is because Hui Shin askes me questions about blogs since she has one now... Somehow, in one way or anothe, I wanted to have a blog again... A different blog from the one I had in Xanga. Anyway, that's it for first post I guess...       Ast
