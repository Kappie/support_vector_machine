Here are some facts about me, I go to the University of Toronto, I study Art History, I have a love/hate relationship with Toronto, I am in constant search for friends, I love Aquarius', I love Architects and Engineers, I wish to be an Architect...that is only if UofT grants me to be accepted to the MA Architecture program.  I love to dance, I started dancing when I was three, I love to get into my own little world when dancing to house or techno.  I'm a Libra, so I am very sexual, creative, diplomatic and balanced in life.  I like to "party", but I also like to be serious and relax with friends or a good book.    Check out my website: http://individual.utoronto.ca/fourthdimension/ My site is a very brief description of why I am interested in the fourth dimension.    I believe my life cannot be clearly defined, I live a unprescribed and free world even though people around this conservative city try to hold free individuals down!  Hehehe, that is my beef with Toronto, I can't stand the in your face "bling", snobbery and self-centredness of this city that could offer so much more.  I look to Montreal as a model for Canadian cities or Vancouver.  Okay I must stop this rant...later.
