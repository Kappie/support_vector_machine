Stress at home is a big factor, but also since I got fired from work (a long story, it wasn't my fault) I decided nothing's holding me back, I'm outtie.  Truth is, I will be coming back for every youth event. So you guys are sorta bringin' me back.   Just a short note, really. I must get going, laundry and packing to do. See you all soon! :)
