I went swimming in my new wetsuit yesterday and WOW what a difference. I was having to put in half the effort to go twice as far! It was amazing. I can't wait to see what a difference it'll make in my race times!  I had a very good weekend. I spent the majority of the time outside and exercising so today I am beat but...oh well. I only have this week to train and then next week is tapering for the race. I'm getting more and more nervous/anxious. One of my friends says that I can use his new bike...but I don't have the time to get used to it although if the difference is the same between swiming without a wetsuit and swiming with one. The offer is VERY tempting. I don't know though. I'll have to think about it a little more. Maybe if I put regular pedals on it....  I have to run a long run this week and see how my knee holds up. so far it has been doing really well so that is good! I love being able to push my body again!   Only one week to go til Bala
