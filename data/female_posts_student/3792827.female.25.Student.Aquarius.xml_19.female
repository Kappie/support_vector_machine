I have some issues that I'm dealing with now that involve my health, but I'll be ok eventually. That's kind of bumming me out and making me frustrated, but better that than PEOPLE. Hopefully in a month or so this issue will be resolved and I can get off of these damn meds. They make me SO sick to my stomach.  My mom and I were talking about my dad the other day. She said that even though they were divorced before he died, she still cries about him and wishes he was here now. I don't normally like to talk about him being gone though. I prefer to talk about the time that he was here. So, that conversation made me a bit sad. I've thought about making him a tribute page. He will always live on.   Fred "Flintstone" Roach
