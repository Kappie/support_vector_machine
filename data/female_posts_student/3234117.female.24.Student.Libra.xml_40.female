I have a lot of respect for her because she handles it so incredibly well! If it were me, I'd probably cry myself to sleep every night. My sister is the stong emotioned one. I am not. I can muster up some tears anytime, any place, anywhere. It's what I do!    Anyway now she's on the prowl looking for others. She joined this internet dating site called the dilly that her friend joined. This scares me. Her first guy she metis 21. His nameis Nate. Why a 21 year old would have any desire to be with a High School Senior is beyond me. It brings me back to a memory of mine though. After Travis and I broke up he immediately, well 3 months later, started dating a college freshman named Tara. Why else would a senior date a freshman? Anyway Ashley and I spent many conversations figuring out how we'd check this girl out. Our final idea was to go to the dorms and sell girl scout cookies in hopes she'd answer the door. Don't worry, we didn't really do this. I did end up seeing her. In a picture he kept by his bed.   Back on the topic. So this Nate guy lives in Fort Worth and they've gone out to some live music places in Deep Ellum together. The next guy she met is named Ben. She took me with her to meet him. He works at Pluckers so yesterday we went and checked him out. He's actually cute. If he were 5 years older, I'd date him. He goes to UNT though. My poor sister can't meet anyone that lives semi-close to her.    Luckily she'll be 18 soon so I plan on taking her out. Although there aren't too many places that are 18 and up. Anyway if you feel like checking her out, this is her  urlLink profile  on the dilly.
