It is true but it hurts. You know what I mean. sigh. Love. love. love.    Sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being. Each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light. - Albert Schweitzer   Yeah its true. I really wanna thank my friends who've been there for me throughout. I lvoe them so much and I'll treasure them forever!    The hardest things in life is which bridge to cross and which to burn. -David Russel   I know that and I've experienced it. I've  burned the wrong bridge  and  crossed the other one . Now I regret all those  wrong bridge  that I've  crossed  and ignored the deserving ones.    That's all for now...
