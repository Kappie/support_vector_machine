Later my mom and I are going to look at some cars.. she wants to sell hers, and get a BWM.. maybe. That would be cool, i guess. And then I might do something with Emily, at least I hope so. So if I see her then I need to get a birthday present for her.. hmm. OMG Paxton told me that his dog died and her told Jennifer that Mr. Fuentes' snake died. He is probably lying. I should call Mr. Fuentes and tell him that Paxton killed his snake.. nahh.. but that would be pretty funny. I'm still trying to fix my sunt's MSN, I hope it works.. cause I can't call everyone. It's 11:30 so I am gunna try to occupy myself somehow. Sorry if I spelt that wrong. hah. later.     urlLink
