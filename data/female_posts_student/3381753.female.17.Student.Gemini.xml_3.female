I am extremely tired, this is completely my fault though because I didn't have to stay at Adam's until 1:30 when I knew I had to be awake at 7:00 for work at 9:00. Ugh. I didn't go to sleep until about 2:30 and I woke up at 7:00. Lovely lack of sleep I would say.   Today I am supposed to be doing something with Ashley. I'm going to call her in a few minutes, I really wanna go to the movies, so we shall see what happens.  Ugh I am so tired, and this is all after I slept at Adam's for 3 hours. He had promised his brother he would play a game with him online before I had gotten there, so at 10:00, they finally started playing it and since I was so tired and had nothing else to do, I fell asleep. Then at about 1:30 I feel someone on top of me (gently laying, not sexual) and I wake up to see my Adam. Then I laid around with him for a while, and I could hardly keep my eyes open so I decided it was best to go home. He offered to follow me, but I said I was ok.   Damn period happening every month on our anniversary. But I don't know, he seemed very much less affectionate because of the fact that we couldn't have sex. I hope that our relationship isn't just sex to him, because that would kill me. Sex can be an important part, but not the entire thing, and definetly not the MOST important part.   I am beginning to think that all the plans for this summer, his special proposal, his already purchasing a ring and making payments on it, the whole theory of borrowing his mom's boyfriends pontoon, or renting an RV, none of it is going to happen.   I am not holding my breath. I love Adam dearly, I just think he's a lot of talk.
