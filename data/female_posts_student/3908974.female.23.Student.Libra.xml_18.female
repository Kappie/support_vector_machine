Which means I may be without it at work until the end of my days there.  Which will be this December, I hope.  Will begin teaching then, which scares me to death and makes me feel pleasantly adult at the same time.  So...I am just waiting for my man to call me.  He's back in lovely Kansas today, but won't be with me until tomorrow.  I feel so giddy and immature at the prospect of seeing him again.  In class today I tallied up the remaining hours of his absence.  Pathetic!  Whatever happened to being cool and nonchalant?  I think I should take a page from Jane Eyre's book and try to be more callous, at least to his face.  I am so gooey that I fear he will stop taking me seriously.  Is that true about men, that you always have to keep them guessing, just to pique their interest?  But he is a different sort of guy.    I don't know.  It's all a goddamn mystery to me.    So work stinks.  I forgot my coffee thermos, so I got this terrible headache.  Feels like a vise around my skull.  I have a shamelessly addictive personality type.  I find that I am easily addicted to routines, places, drinks, smokes, the computer, and all manner of hedonistic habits.  If only I could become addicted to exercise and stalks of celery, Wow.  Watch out.    I can't seem to get anything done.  Writing has not been inspiring, and reading my assigned books has been about all I can do in the name of scholarly activity.  I feel compelled to read nineteenth century romances and cry at the touching parts.  Oh, Mister Rochester!  Oh Jane!  Let me at least think of one worthwhile thing to note on my Blurty, some memory or feeling or revelation:  Honestly, nothing soulful today.  Just me and my frivolous use of my limited time, and not so repentant about it, either.
