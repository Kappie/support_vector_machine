As with most things, there seems to be a form or function issue. If you want good padding and plenty of space for files, CDs, and all your other junk, you're stuck with an ugly Targus bag that looks like a cheap suitcase from 1965. There are nicer-looking bags, but rarely with enough pockets and protective cushioning.   I think I found the perfect combination in the  urlLink Casauri New Portfolio . It's made of water resistant nylon, has tons of pockets outside and inside, comes with a detachable shoulder strap, and comes in all sorts of lovely colors like kiwi and navy. It's decently priced too, at $106.00.   urlLink Acme Made Laptop Bags  are pretty cute too, but they look rather flimsy and have one measly rear pocket on the outside. As cute as the pink polka dots are, the lack of space for even a power adapter is kind of a deal breaker.
