This afternoon, after a frusterating three hours packing, I went out to get a Blizsard at Dairy Queen.  When I was coming back, I noticed a well dressed man in a three piece black suit and shiny dress shoes carrying garbage out to the dumpsters.  Though I was not in a great mood, it made me smile.  I am chalking it up to the strangest thing I have seen, at least today.    I am dabbling in a book called  Fruitflesh, seeds of inspiration for women who write  by Gayle Bradneis.  If you're a writer and a woman, I reccommend this book.  She discusses in the introduction how the observation of a strawberry changed her life. The meditation exercises in the book revolve around the observation of different fruits.  The book is one that helps teach the power that observation has in each of our lives and how our lives can be inspired and enriched by simply seeing, actually seeing, what's around us.  It's a facinating read.  I am also currently working on my first assignment for my writing group and let me tell you I am having a blast. It's coming along nicely, though I will not say what it is and I am having a very good time.  I am also in school right now taking english and government.  I am not having the greatest time with either to be truthful.  I enjoy english, though the finer points elude me sometimes.  Government on the other hand must have been put on this Earth to torment and torture us to ultimate bordem and self loathing!  For those who enjoy government, I am hearly sorry, and not for my comments herein.    Kristyn
