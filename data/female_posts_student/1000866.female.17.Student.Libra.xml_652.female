Then, I came home and hung around my brother's party for a bit. That was alright. Then, thankfully, Bryan called and saved me. I went to his house and we watched Aladdin. It was AWESOME. I haven't seen Aladdin in forever. So, good times.   Today I didn't do like...anything. Eek. I feel so unproductive. I watched Chicago and the first Shrek with my family. That was ok I guess. Tomorrow I have to wake up early for that stupid parade. Booo. I don't want to go really. Oh well. What to do, what to do? Anyway, I think I'm going to go sleep for a bit but...I meant to mention this a few days ago to MC and forgot to put it in here. Staying away from those kilts I hope? Hah.   XOXO
