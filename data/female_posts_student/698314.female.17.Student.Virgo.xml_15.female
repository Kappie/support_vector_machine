Went to the beach twice that was it.  Then I started working.  I work at Lucille Roberts babysitting.  It's not bad.  I also started working a basketball camp for Coach Johnson.  That's interesting.  Last week was little girls (35 of them, not too bad- I had the youngest and I swear my team was special ed or something... it was horrible) Now this week is boys.  (80 of them! it's nuts- I have the lil ones again... it's ok... we'll see how this goes) that runs 8:30-3 so then I go home have a little break and go right to work monday-thursday. Just got back last night from orientation.  That was a lot of fun.  Met some really cool people. I'm ready to go!! Mom and I also drove around and saw a lot of the area... that was cool.  Also got my official schedule.  :-) I have Friday's off- oh yes, be jealous... be very jealous... other than that nothing's going on... IM me if you want to talk..... later
