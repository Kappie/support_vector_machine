We don't usually do it cuz we're so comfortable and not on anyone's bad side. Our car got broken into. How much more parc (look at it backwards) can happen this week!?!?!?    My grandma had a heart attack (dad's mom) 2 nights ago. We went to go see her yesterday, I'm hearing more lies about myself...people are talking about me...AGAIN, and now Daddy's softball equipmentand my glove has been stolen?? What's this madness, and why!?!?    Earlier this week, Daddy said he found 2 of our CD's in the grass and we were putting piece and piece together and figured someone stole our stuff..... I'll WBL, I'm going up to the field w/ Jojo to see if our stuff is up there....
