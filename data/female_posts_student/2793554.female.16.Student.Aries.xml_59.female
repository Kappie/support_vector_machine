I feel like dylan takes me for granted. dating him is like being slapped and kissed at the same time... i feel like a dumb housewife.  GAH! I dont even know. I'm insane. i love him more than ive ever loved anyone before... more than anything in my life... but i just... cant even comprehend why i put up with this shit sometimes.  i was reading my old journals and its just... the same thing. its like a vicious cycle that we go through every couple of months. i feel like i can never talk to him about stuff... i do all the talking and he doesnt and then we both ignore it until it gets way horrible and then we break up or something, and then we date again and this wonderful cycle goes on and on....  goddamn. everybody needs to GROW THE FUCK UP.and boys are stupid. its amazing the whole world isnt lesbian...  i wish i felt appreciated. Me and dylans 1 year anniversary is in 3 DAYS! ... i hope he plans something really cool and exciting... he should, he stood me up today and made me cry and was a shitty boyfriend....he should do something huge and extravagant and awesome to make up for it.  i feel taken for granted... i could really leave at any time....  pbthhh.  oh god, homework. and then sleep. I swear, i have insomnia... i never sleep and its horrible.  abby
