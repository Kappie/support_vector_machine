I've had this weird stomach virus thing since sunday night and, I've gotten blood drawn and got to pee in a cup and they still don't know what's wrong. And for those of you that have never pissed in a cup, let me tell you how fun that is! Ohh man goodtimes. Most akward moment of the week. Now I think I'm getting better, hey as long as I don't eat solid foods I'm good.   Woo! only like 4 more days till I go see David, yay! I need to go to sleep, lol. YAY kiera's over. Say hi Kiera, hey y'all. YAY!!!!  ok bye bye   I wish like hell I could go back in time Maybe then I could see how Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try But it's too late, it's over now
