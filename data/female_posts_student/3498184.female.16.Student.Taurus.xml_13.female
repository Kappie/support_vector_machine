Yesterday was awesome! Stina, Derek and I went to flowing lake. We burnt our feet on the sand when we were playing volleyball with some little kids. After that we went swimmin' in the lake. It's a nice lake, but it's full of rocks and it's pretty shallow. 400 lasted about 10 seconds....it's hard when the rocks were attacking your feet. I had flip-flops on though, so I was alright. When we were getting ready to leave we were feeding the ducks, and the ranger guy was like "DON'T FEED THE DUCKS! I WILL KILL YOU!" ....well, instead of "I will kill you" it was "it will make them sick" but it was almost the same.       We all went back to Stina's and made sandwiches. I made the best bagel-cream cheese-salami sandwhich ever. They had boring Ham and Cheese. haha. We drove over to Langis (Sure that's right) Park and had a picnic over-looking the ocean. Stina slipped on a water bottle when she was trying to leap over Derek and landed straight on her back. She was like pissing her pants laughing. :-D   At the park we played silly kids games, and swung for like 45 mins before we had to go home.   After that we all went to my house and chilled out in the hottub for like 2 hours. We talked, listened to music,and gazed at the stars. I SAW 8 SHOOTING STARS! I wasted all of them on one stupid wish too...       When we all got back to Christina's, we were all jazzed and not tired so we thought we could stay up for the Dane Cook DVD since Derek hadn't seen it. Nope, we all pretty much fell asleep on the couches. Stina suggested we go to bed, so we got ready and we all slept on Stina's bed. Stina was the pimp in the middle of Derek and I. Haha, at 6:45 I woke up becuz Stina wassnoring directly into my eardrum. I stumbled my way to the floor and fell asleep...The alarm went off at 10ish becuz we had to leave to pick up Colin at like 12. We all heard the alarm, and we all fell right back asleep. I was awakend by Derek getting up saying it was 12. Haha, Silly us.   We picked up Colin, then dropped him off, dropped Derek off at his house, and Stina  I went back to her house to watch TV for a while. Then at 4 I went home. Good times.      ~Bayz
