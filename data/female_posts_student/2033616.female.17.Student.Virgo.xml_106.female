He's a shallow heartless child... you just havn't taken off your rose color glasses yet  2. It is but hadn't ought to be...       Nothing is more painful than seeing every one of your fears and failures play out again and again.  What can you do... take the bullet and keep running.  3. The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool       Woe-is-me should not be met with sympathy.  Go to someone who's wise enough to tell you "you're a screw up, but it's okay, now what can you change?"  4. How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard       When they leave, why do we pour over the sadness of the end.  Get your head out of the ground, just because you won't let the end come doesn't mean it won't.  They're starting new lives, doing new things!  This is exciting, not sad.  5.  The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart       We don't all hold hands in life and trudge forward, we do this on our own.  Sometimes it's hard to realize our paths stop crossing so often.  But I'm still here... i'm just walking an extra three feet to your left.  6.If you're headed in the wrong direction, God allows U-turns.       You're falter isn't your road to failure.  Surprise some people  and make them proud; dig yourself out... they'll help you if you need it.  7.One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important.       There's a little picture, and a big picture.  The big picture is the reward of realizing the little pictures really arn't that amazing anyway.  Don't stress.  Your fate will never lie in a single task.    8. Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy        Your plan will never be hitchless, your intention never fully comprehended.  Understand that and you'll be rolling before the punches even start comming.  9. If only we'd stop trying to be happy we could have a pretty good time.         Be cheerful, not happy.  Happiness will fade, but cheer is there in good times in bad.    10.Sometimes I wish I were a little kid again, skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts.        Life is sad, goodbyes are sad, broken hearts are sad, the world in general is sad.  But things will heal, the sun will shine, and maybe, just maybe you can work something out.
