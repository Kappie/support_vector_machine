It was telling me that I should care less what other people think, and what everyone else's opinion is. Because it's  my  life, and I need to stop caring about what everyone else thinks! It's repetitively told to me, but now that I'm even telling myself that, it has a stronger effect. Sheesh! Insane. I'd been trying to prove everyone wrong about that, and that what other people think is more important, but maybe I need to be a little more concerned with what I want and what I think. After all...it's my life. Wow...that hit me just instantly a few minutes ago...out of absolutely nowhere. Because in my dream, everyone kept swaying my opinion, and I made a huge mistake...but then I realized "Oh my gosh...what about what I want? What about my opinion, and how I see things?" And so I went and got back everything I'd lost, and all was well. I hope I still have time to do that.
