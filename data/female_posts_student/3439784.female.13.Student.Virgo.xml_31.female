Friend  ;A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.  wow!! thats crazy. i trust few people in this world. its a funny thought actually, you should really be carefull who you call a friend. i guess, there are your friends. your close friends. your bestfriends. and your real friends. hm..i'll keep that in mind.  i was reading someone elses blog when i got the idea..why not come clean on some things ive done bad in the past?  well, people are always reassuring me that im a great friend and blah blah. and i appreciate it and on the occasion i believe it. but really we're all just hypocrits. we all lie. we all gossip. we all make mistakes. its a way of living and if we didnt do those things we wouldnt learn. i know ive gone behind my friends back before, in fact endless times. i know ive bad mouthed, i know ive lied, and i know ive broken trust. i know i have done these things and i know people do it to me everyday. what can you do to change that? absolutely nothing. there will never be trust in this world because in the end the only person you can trust is yourself.  frik i dont know where i was leading to with that one. wow my brain thinks faster than i type.  is honesty   always   the best policy in a relationship? because the truth hurts right. you dont want to hurt loved ones so why do we tell the truth then? because if we dont we go crazy inside with guilt? then wouldnt that make us selfish, because we have to let out some lie thats making us feel guilty and to relieve that we hurt someone else.    [[That is soo tru...i mean...people today in the world are fightin becuz they are a different colour or they speak differnet languages. I think it is time they look around them and tell us what the big difference is that causes death and hatred! We are all the same on the inside...do we not each have a heart? or a brain? What is it that some people lack that makes others want to kill? I for one am so sick of racism and its results....! I think that the Lion King is a wonderful story that portrays that real meanin of life which is basically just ot be part of the CIRLCLE OF LIFE!]]   props to zo on that one. but seriously! why do we fight about the most insignificant things like religion and race and culture. people take those things too seriously. i mean we're all here to live, love, and die. if you're going to have a problem with someone, dont have it because of something they cant control. or something so innocent like religion culture and race.     what the hell is wrong with me? lol im so all over the place. disregard all of that above unless it  ACTUALLY  makes sense to you. haha let me know.  .chels.
