It was there when I needed it, it was there even when I didn't need it, and it will still be there in the fall when I endlessly return to it. Uhg.  Acutally I just really don't feel like writing my essay for honors summer reading right now, and I'm wasting time. I should be writing it. It needs to be postmarked by Thursday, so I figure that I'll whip it out tomorrow, have my mum edit it and then the mailman shall whisk it away. Ah the glories of the ever victorious mailman.   My dogs are uncool. Yes they are cute as your britches, but they are also as smart as monkeys.  They figured out that they can dig straight down and under the electric fence, and not get shocked. Seeing as half the fence was shorted out anyway becuase of mny families lack of interest in using the weed wacker, I'm suprised the dogs didn't figure it out sooner. They really are quite clever beasts. They have out smarted metal poles around the yard, 4 feet under the dirt, three feet of the poles visible (the poles were placed every six inches all the way around the yard. Those blasted dogs have out smarted the cement that we used to fill in the holes that they dug. They have out smarted the underground invisible shocker fence (of that I only have a vague I idea of how they conquered it.) And yet they have been the victor over the chains that we used to tie them up with. The dogs are just too smart. And they love it. Whereas other dogs love being walked and petted, our dogs love out smarting my family and I. Sure they love their walks, and they love being brushed and they love food, and they love attention, but those are all second to making us feel like stupid humans. So to solve our escaping dogs problem we put an electrified fence all around the yard. My brother and I were out repairing it last night and I grabbed it. what fun. There was no shock until I grounded myself with my other hand. Twas exciting indeed.  On Friday I start my summer job. Yeah, it is a little late to start a job for the summer, but hey, better Friday than never.  I shall be the canvas puller for the shakers. I'm willing to bet only .5% of the population of the USA even knows what that means.  My grandparents own a mongo cherry farm and run one of the biggest northern michigan cherry industries.  So lucky for me I get to work with them! Fun. But hey I already have my own bedroom there.  The Gramps decided to go about the cherry season with an old fashioned sense this year. Only family shall bring in the cherry harvest. Usually there are a bunch of migrant workers from mexico that come and do it, but this year the late frost and cold weather killed enough of the cherries that the family would manage it. So I, the unlucky (or lucky considering my situation of owing over two thousand dollars at the moment) granddaughter have been reeled into pulling the canvases under the trees while the big shaker machinery shakes all the cherries off on to the canvases. Delightful really.   I do enjoy cherries though, and maybe I'll work the apple season too, seeing as I need all the money that I can get. (Yes this awesomely huge farm also has apples.) I really prefer the apple season, because I love Macintosh apples, and ida reds, yummy. If you cut out the core of an Ida Red then fill it with brown sugar and nuke it in the microwave for a minute, you'll taste one of my favourite treats. It really is getting dreadfully late now, and I should be fast asleep. or slow asleep, whichever applies at the moment.  Buy a stranger a meal.  brie
