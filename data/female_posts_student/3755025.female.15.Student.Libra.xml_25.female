(that was delayed) then we had to go to newark.. where the pilot was missing...which also happened at detroit...except..the whole crew was in baltimore...  so we had to wait 3 hours for the crew to get there.. then the pilot got airsick (go figure) and then.. we had to circle the rochester airport because the airforce guard was there and it was closed...(goddamn government)
