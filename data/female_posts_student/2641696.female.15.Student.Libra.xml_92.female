BW and I got along really well, I made fun of SAC guys' skirts and 'glittery tube tops' (LOLLLL *falls off chair* C, mention that to J ^^;) and they actually had a sense of humour about it, TCS was just beautiful and, the best part of all: debating was awesome! The first time was, obviously, just insane, and I was very, very nervous. Since I was PM, I had to go first, and my first 5-min. speech wasn't too great. But my refutations at the end were awesome, and I had gotten used to it by then and aieee! Funnnnn! Also, the speaker and time-keeper were hothothot in my first debate. The time-keeper especially. He looked like that guy from  Swing Kids  and  The Dead Poet Society . All my partners were just great, too. Got along fantasmically with them all.   So, in the end, I came in tenth out of forty. Pretty damn good, seeing as that was the first time in my life I'd ever debated, I'd only known about it for a week, and yadda yadda yadda. Normally the first ten spots or so are reserved for experienced debaters. But yayyy! Since CDS is hosting the Fulford Competition next year, I won't get to participate, but I sure as hell will be a speaker / time-keeper. So fun! Met so many people!! And if T doesn't have a gf I'll be jumping for joy ^^; More on that later though, heehehehee.   All in all, though, 'twas a grand success. Oh, and one thing the judges all had in common: they all thought I was a very convincing and energetic speaker. I coulda told 'em that, ne? ^^;;;;;;;;;;;; *gags on her arrogance*   OH!!! And J came I think 3rd in the Senior division! Or maybe 4th. But either way he got a certificate thingy! JD didn't do too well because he was really, really sick (as in, he wasn't in the van with us for fear of barfing all over everyone (which he did in his car on the way there)). And while we were eating dinner, the 'big speech guy' came over to C and told her that she had a wonderful gift, and that she shouldn't waste it. Of course, she also managed to convince two gr. 12s that she was their soulmate, but ya know. I think she may have a new boyfriend. Maybe two. Not quite sure. At the very least, the backseat was steamy ^^; heeheheheehe.   And T was the awesomely skilled and adorable guy from Crescent. Funny, cute, nice blue eyes and he looked like a hobbit. Cute guy overload over there, man. Yayyy! So's anyways, expect me to be quite argumentative over the next few days. Hehee. *jumps for joy and runs off to do her much-procrastinated comp. sci. ISU*
