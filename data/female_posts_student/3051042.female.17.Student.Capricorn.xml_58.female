Mike and April broke up or are one a "break." I talked with Mike last night, he's alright. I need to talk with April, I'm worried about her. To tell you the truth I thought she broke up with him. Oops...  And as for the remnants of yesterday, I went to the mall and bought a dress (I know you're proud Michelle) after getting my car back from the Ford Service Department. I knew I wanted to by something, I just didn't know what. I changed my work hours. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday. Now only 4 days of work instead of 5. I don't know how I'll live with 6 hours on Sunday but we'll see. I need to find a new job.  I'm too lazy to go into detail of what's pissed me off the last couple days, but I should probably turn in my applications to colleges and companies.   8:00, I think I actually might go to class today.
