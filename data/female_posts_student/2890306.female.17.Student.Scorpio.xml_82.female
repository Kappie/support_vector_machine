I remember going to the circus and seeing clowns and going to the bathroom and crying the whole time I was at the circus. But, now, they don't bother me. In fact, my church has a group called "The Clowns of St. John." Basically, they go around to the hospitals and visit sick kids. So, in that perspective, clowns are good. But, who knows? Maybe it's just some big cover-up?
