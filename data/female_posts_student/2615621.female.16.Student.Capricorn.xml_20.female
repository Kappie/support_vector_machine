He can deal. He was just playing around ne ways..idk he then got offline. Oh well TDB. Kristen then begged me to go this weekend to meet these 2 guys..she gets on who she's been talking to and i get his friend..yay i always get the stupid friends, but hey i guess everyone has a friend..rite...well, he does have a kick ass name , so that made me want to go. Lorne. Thorne Lorne..haha that rhymes. I would have been a lot more excited about meeting him if kristen didnt go and tell his friend (the guy shes talkin to) that i was sweet and hot and a wild child. HELLO?! hot..um no...wild child...how about just not bright enought to understand what im doing LMAO..sweet...just maybe..to strangers at least. Kristen is always like..ohh ur so pretty i'm sure he'll like u!! uh shut ur fucking mouth. If i was sooo pretty kristen then i would have a freakin bf. Gah, i try but it never happens. Ne ways..i'm still going to the mall this weekend and she keeps refering to it as a "blind date" um..thats kinda weird. We're just hanging out. Who knows, maybe this guy is a real catch and i'm being superfical (i heard he had black/ dark brown hair..and usually i dont go for that). haha oh well, at least it adds a new guys list to my yahoo list. HAHA a new guy to talk to, so when someone asks who im talking to i can tell one more guys name..hahaha ok thats low, but it made me crack up. I did buy a new shirt today. i got it from marices and its purple and has a lavander stripe down the arms and it has some glitter on it..it's cute. It was on sale, only cost me like $11 some and it's long sleeved...stupid people already putting out spring and summer clothes. ne ways, i hope it snows..it better snow..i still have a map of the world to draw, lable and color...and a test to make up on it...damn.
