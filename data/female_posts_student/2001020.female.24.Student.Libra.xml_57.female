Something has to be different every day, doesn't it? Anyway, so I got laid last night, whoo hoo! M doesn't seem to have the sex drive that I do, and that's always frustrating. But last night he came into the bed, said, "I love you (I don't think there was any way that he was sleeping this time," and I said, "No, you don't," and then we proceeded to get it on. So, if he was sleeping during THAT I-love-you incident, well, then he was also sleeping during sex. I have a hard time believing that's true. So whatever. Anyway, I really think Property is calling my name, and since I have a shitload to review, I'd better hop to it. I took an extended nap today, which wasn't smart but I had no control over that, and so now I should be rearing to go...right? Hmmph. Anyway, laters.
