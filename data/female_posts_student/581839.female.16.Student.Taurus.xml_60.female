Oh! today i planned out (sort of) what i'm gonna do on my birthday since it's coming up, April 22. I'm going to invite Katie-Beth, Bess, and Danielle O'bannon over. we're probably going to go to a mall and dave n' busters or whatever (katie beths idea), and then probably KRISPY KREME! yeah baby. then we'll probably watch monty python, legally blonde, and we'll probably rent some movies before hand. I'll open presents (if i get any this year) and we'll probably bake brownies. fun fun fun! i know, i'm a master when it comes to fun. it's just my nature baby. oh, pancakes! byeya!
