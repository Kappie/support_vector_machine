" im hungry " " im tired" " im bored" " my ear hurts" haha... fuck! i think  i have an ear infection.. cos my ear hurts a shit load....and aww p drew me pictures.. :D  *pm1:55*       "You can't just love somebody, and say you love them, you have to show them, and nurture it"    This is what im doing to Markus. I don't like him, i dont have feelings for him , other than being a good friend. I know i feel this way, and i know how it feels to like someone, and he is not the one i like. I feel bad when i say " I love you " when i know i dont.       My step-dad and i dont have the  best  relationship. I have been wanting to get a christmas tree for the longest time now. I  love  decorating for the christmas holiday, and so does he. We usually always pick out the tree as a family, me my mom, my stepdad and stepbrother, but this year, my stepdad and i might be going to Half moon bay together to pick out our tree. I know that would make my mom  hella  happy for us to do something together since we arent always getting along, hell, we hardly even talk to each other unless we are arguing.... :D I hope we get to go...  *11:45* HEY.... eww i had a dream about Justin Julien... gross...
