Odd that now I come to think of it both of the last two have been about a lack of faith. Probably due to my brief sojourn at Lucy's house...  I got a postcard from my old French teacher today, which upset me really as French lessons were the main reason I   didn't   want to leave the high school. Sounds odd I know, but for me they incorporated the things I will most miss: being part of a group that has existed for so long everyone is completely comfortable with it; being a dominant member of that group (which I mainly experienced in French as my two friends who tend to drown everybody else out weren't in it); feeling intelligent for once in my life and enjoying working as a team with Cesca (hehe we made such a good pairing in French!!) oh i could go on but I've written so much today, it being that time of the month when i get weepy and over emotional and lethargic.  Sometimes you just want to put every aspect of your life on pause and take some time out to think without being plagued by splitting headaches! Everything just seems a bit messy at the moment... Ah well such is life I suppose.
