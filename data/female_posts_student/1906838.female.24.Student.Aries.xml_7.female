TWICE. and i still havent learnt my lesson. i seriously feel like kicking myself hard in the arse if its anatomically possible. if i werent so penggeli, id actually flush my head in the toilet to make myself SEDAR. WAKE UP. see the REAL WORLD. know who ur friends are. Know who the pple who actually CARE about u are.  hah .. im really screwed up now.
