But instead of throwing away that tough outer layer of fat on the ham, she made... cracklins... And I... Ate one.  and the shock of the fact that I had just consumed pork fat fried in -pork fat- was so overwhelming I had to try it again just to be sure of what I had done.  eww!  It's been yet another one of those loverly emotionally overcharged weeks in which everything is a nice blur with just a tinge of green.  FLCL, Fury Cury, Foolly Coolly, wtf? I suppose I should start from the begining on this one: I enjoy the occasional anime. Wild looking characters, plots that are actual plots, and well, that nice zombie feeling you get when you flick one on the tell. Most of the time I stick with adult swim's inuyasha and cowboy bebop, but in a bout of boredom I turned on AS and they were running the first episode of -that show-... The show that is -so cool-, nobody even knows how to spell it. Is it sex? Is it drugs? Is it drug-induced sex? Can anybody tell me? The only way to put it is, well, FLCL. It's one of those shows that you think you can just put your brain into neutral and enjoy some mindless entertainment, but NO! It's like one of those freaky enlightenment things where when it's over you're like "that was so wrong, it must be god". But anyways, I searched for an explanation of the plot online and the only thing I found when searching for "FLCL explain" was "FLCL is impossible to explain" or "anyone who says they can explain FLCL is a dirty liar".   alright, I don't know why, but you must watch it. It's like snorting the canned air that you clean your keyboard with. Need a preview? Well lemme see: alien girl cracks young unsuspecting boy over the head with bass guitar and suddenly he's got stuff popping out of his head but it's ok cause he's the special one and then he's all Stockholm syndrome in love and then the girl flies away.  this week we decided to move the treadmill that was in the garage into our room. Seeing as it was buried under the massive pile of shit that WAS our house, I probably exercised more bringing it in the house than I will using it. However after several minutes of lifting, pulling, yanking, yelling, and a bitch-flavored commentary from mammaw along the way, we got it into our room and fully functioning.   being in that smelly garage full of my old life makes my heart ache. I had such a nice life. I had my own room, 3 beautiful cats that I loved more than anything, there was always king vitamin and yogurt in the house, and it seemed just perfect. To think of where I am now, smashed in between my mother and my sister, always feeling indebted to my grandmother who is more bitter than licorice and earwax sandwitches, this house is like one big happiness sucker. That's what I think about every day when I get off the bus and stare around at everything and wonder: will they be arguing today? Did I do or neglect to do something that has now got me in trouble? Is Devon here? Because I like it when Devon is over at valerie's when I get home.  the thing that bothers me the most is the way my mother treats my grandmother. I mean, we live in HER house, we use a bunch of HER stuff, doesn't SHE deserve some shred of gratitude? Maybe mom is too proud to be grateful, and it doesn't help that mammaw resents her every movement, but sooner or later won't they have to come to terms? Why do I worry about this bullshit?  it bothers me to think that this is where my life will be. This is where I will finish highschool, live during college, and be connected to for the rest of my life. When I look back on my younger years all I will see is the fact that WE lived with our grandmother,  and that the grandmother DID NOT live with US. This place, this hellhole, this house, will be the bulk of my memories. I may touch briefly on other things: cross lake, my old house, my exstepdad, Tyler, and smile a little, but then wipe the smile off my face and think "divorced, gone in the bankruptcy, dead, trucked off with Rick to Canada, or maybe just lost"  Thursday Devon got into serious trouble. She went on errands with some other kid and her mom but didn't call momma and stayed gone for like six hours. When she came home she was bawling and squaling and absolutely pitiful. So, of course, all mom did was ground her from the phone for the week((which isn't even being properly enforced)). Because Devon is so horribly distraught and unable to leave the bedroom I get stuck with her chores and get, well, bullied by momma who is so wrapped up in the daughter she was going to "kill" an hour ago.   so I'm sitting on the bathroom floor putting away this amazingly large amount of toilet paper and mammaw walks in and stands over me and it like "when you finish that you can sweep". Like I did something wrong!?! helloooo! This is the good kid! So what do I do? I stop wrestling the plastic wrap on the toilet paper and look in the mirror and  make the kicked puppy face((it's my favorite face to make because it indicates the deepest and most gut-wrenching angst)). Everything this happens, I almost instantly feel better because I think about Andrew and the canoe trip where we and a couple other kids were playing a card game and I made this face and he was like "don't give me those puppy dog eyes, you fat puppy", and I tried to act all -abashed-, but instead I burst out laughing. Since then I always bring that up when I'm around him and he turns a funny color and I just laugh some more.   I had a story to write for morehead, and I really didn't want to, but I did anyway. I turned it in feeling like it was one of the most retarded things I had ever put my name on, adjectives like abysmal and repugnant coming to mind. I went back to her room with Emily later on in the day and she exclaimed that it was a great story and that it was one of my best. If ever my mouth has hung open, it did right then. So since crazy English woman though it was super great I decided to put it on here. Hopefully everyone won't read it and dismiss me as a fop.   here is the story, love child of a late-night coffee break and procrastination at the final point in it's cycle, desperate urgency:  ÂWeÂre uh, gonna have to take you down to the stationÂ 	ÂBut I told you everything!Â 	ÂYes mÂam but we gotta follow procedure.Â 	ÂYou mean IÂm... You think I...Â 	ÂItÂs just a matter of coverinÂ all the bases and explorinÂ all the possibilities.Â 	But still, the idea of me, me the one who never does anything wrong? Who always leaves time on the parking meters and helps old ladies across the street? Well I suppose I never actually helped any old lady down the street, but if I saw one, I surely would! All these years of putting my faith in the goodness of humanity, all the karma IÂm going to lose over this! Just think! One minute IÂm doing fine and the next minute IÂm being taken downtown for robbing a Starbucks? And the worst part is I didnÂt even rob the stupid Starbucks! Starbucks has more of my money than I could ever steal from them in one trip! So IÂm just sitting around and talking to my cat and the policeman comes to the door and is looking for this Frappuccino money that I found in a nice box on my doorstep. He tells me that the station got a call that the money might be here and sure enough, he was right! I was going to turn the money in, I told him, but I was busy! Busy counting it, all $112 and a few cents worth, thirty-two cents, but whoÂs keeping up? Someone has set me up! But who? Who doesnÂt like me so much that they would actually rob a place and leave me with the money?  	ÂWeÂve really gotta get down to the station, missÂ 	ÂI know that! Just give me a second!Â 	ÂYou know, last I heard there was a witnessÂ account that the robber was a man, all we need is for you to sign some stuffÂ 	ÂSo IÂm really really not going to jail?Â 	ÂNopeÂ 	ÂThe big house?Â 	ÂNoÂ 	ÂSkid row?Â 	ÂAh ahÂ 	ÂThe last mile?Â 	ÂNO!Â 	ÂUp the river?Â 	ÂFor godÂs sake girl!Â 	ÂTo the loony bin?Â 	ÂNow THATÂS a possibilityÂ  hope you enjoyed this week's installment.
