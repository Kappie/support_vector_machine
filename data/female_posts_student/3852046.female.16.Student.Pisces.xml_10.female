Well i have just finished my set work so far and so has one of the other girls in my class who i am becoming friends with she is pretty cool and so is her friend Damion.  Well it is nearly time for Tony, mum and I to travel up to Auckland to go see the US Consolate which means I have to have monday of tech so must talk to Chris about that.   I am unsure wether or not I have already told you that I had a fight with one of my best mates about another. Must go as it is lunch now. Peace
