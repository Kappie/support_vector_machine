It all started with the comment I left her:    Sister of mine, you have moved into the world of social behaviour! I am so proud of you! j/k. Glad to see you are following the natural progression of growing up...Helena isn't home, its where you grew up, where your memories are. It isn't even comfortable, its soothing... knowing that it will always be there even if you move. So keep growing exploring and plant seed everywhere...someday they'll grow into roots and you'll stay planted.     It got me thinking. How did I grow out of Helena, or better yet, did I grow out of Helena? Maybe it was Helena that grew up and not me...but due to observation I doubt that. My dad once said something to me and I think for many it holds true "Helena sucks so bad, it will suck you right back." Fortunately for me I have never been back for over 3 months at a go, but that doesn't mean that I don't miss it. Living 3000 miles away has made me remember whatI do love about MT, and why I love going back. Moutains, snow, forrests, fresh air, sun, beautiful sunsets. All of those things are memories I have, with each word I can think of a happy memory, and that is why its good to go back to Helena. What kid from Helena hasn't experienced the Parrot, or the Ox? You say those words and any true Helenan has some memory if not many memories of that place. It great.  But now I think and reflect to my current life, my home since I was 18 has been Seattle, Galway Ireland, San Diego, Derry Ireland, and I am sure there may be a few more before my roots grow and keep me stationary. I am not anticipating where that will be, I know God has plans and its my job to follow, and that is just what I have been doing. But the one constant that remains is Helena and my friends and family. The one thing I long for most (well 2 things) are friends/family and Montana. Its in my heart and in my soul. It has made me the person I am today and for that I am thankful, but its now my time to venture out into this wild world and create a home for my children to be that will someday be there place of soothing, and serenity. Until then, I hope my adventures continue to occur.
