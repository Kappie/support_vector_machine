Has anyone else got so much coursework that they haven't breathed proper fresh air for about 2 weeks or something stupid. I am absolutely swamped. Although I have to say I am getting quite into my media studies coursework (its fun ain't it lynne!!), just generally rambling on about violence in society and the media and such. Its nice to have a good old rant!!!! mmmm.... i'm hungry, think i mite go raid the cupboards hang on a sec.....
