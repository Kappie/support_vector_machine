LOL Oh it was such a trying day with a bunch of rude people trying to buy stuff they don't need (me included) but hey, at least I wasn't rude about it.       You know what I just noticed? I just noticed that this blog thing changed. WOW! I like it. I am feeling better today, nothing like some shopping to uplift your spirits right? haha I know it did wonders for mine.      My dad should be in Australia soon. He has been to so many places, how exciting. I have been here in California for the most part...I ventured into Illinois when Ed was in school there...then took a few trips to NJ, MA, VA, RI, WA, DC, NV (Yes only Reno and Vegas, sad, huh?)...oh and recently FL. But man, he has been around the world. One day. That is my goal to travel in my older age. lol       I have to pay bills...I hate paying bills...I hate credit cards, those evil SOB's. One day I will be debt free (maybe when I actually get a real job and a degree). I have to post some pictures of my kiddos sometime. They are growing so fast. My babies. One more and then we are done...our fmaily is complete now, but one more would definitely make us more complete. haha One day. I want to finish my school first. Oh gosh, school starts up in a month. I bought my paper and bookbag (tent sale). Let's just get done already. I don't even want to think about the amount of money I will be paying for books. UGH      OK I should get back to my boring day of paying bills. Have a good one everyone!
