Once again I'm lamenting this Bravo shit... and the fact that Danah will be GONE.. from my life... with NO SORT OF COMMUNICATION WHATSOEVER... for a WHOLE FRICKING MONTH... I hope I survive.. I honestly think I gonna lose a screw or something... gosh... Today I went to see my little baby... n n n he RAN toward me... n n n huggeddd me n kissedme on my cheek.. that was the best thing I ever got in my entire life ...
