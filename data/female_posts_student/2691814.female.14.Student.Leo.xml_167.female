I carry the heavy stuff from the grocery store, laundry, dishes. I'm mean i really don't mind, its just that im not very used to doing alot of this stuff.  I went to the highschool. we picked up registration packets and now today we have to return them. I dont really like the school. Its old...got some stories to it i bet. But, i guess its okay. I dont care anymore about it tho.  I just want to be back at my aunts house. I liked it there..i liked being back in Miami, seeing my old school and OJ simpsons house lol. I got to see the house that all of my aunts uncles and just everyone in the family grew up in...even i lived there. Old house, i miss it...it was just so pretty and grama had so many different things to look at.  Like the huge ass sword fish my dad and uncle donny caught. But anyway the ppl that own that house now...yes everyone who grew up there, we're gone but the ppl that live there now painted the doors white and it doesn't look all that great. They used to be brown and pretty. I only stayed there a few years until we moved to WV but, i LOVED that house lol. But enough about that. Enough about all of it. Im going todo my regular routine today:sit and watch stupid television shows that have no meaning to my life....nice huh?
