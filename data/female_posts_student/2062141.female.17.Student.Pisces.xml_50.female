I wanted to announce that it was a good day, because I wore my new cool 80s black-with-pink-and-blue-sparkles sweater and i was a sexybeast. I was the sexybeastiest. (I'm stealing your word, Charlotte, just like how you steal my witty remarks! I'm the Mary, you're the Rhoda. I'M THE MARY! I'M THE MARY!) I also got this totally awesome grey 60s minidress i got, heh so old school. Think Beatles Ed Sullivan Show. Ah. Wait... that wasn't something interesting to say. Oh well. You still read it, right? Mwahaha. I'm so weird. Man my entries are dumb when I'm content... I never have anything prolific and meaningful to say unless I'm unhappy. (SEE ARCHIVES) There are some pretty fucking deep ones in there. But I can't be unhappy, cause after tomorrow it's a four day weekend, and THANKSGIVING. Meaning I can listen to Christmas music without feeling stupid. And I LOVE Christmas and this has to be the best Christmas ever. (Homer:) Cause if it isn't.... This week is dragging on forever and it's only been 2 days. Oh yeah Vinnie English asked me out on a date yesterday, where the hell did that come from? I don't even really know Vinnie. I guess I'm just so irresistable. That's why I said no. Cause while I am irresistable, I am also delusional and am always thinking that someone better will always come along...   But it's all okay, cause tomorrow I'll wear my new dress, and rock out to the Beatles, and wait for Thanksgiving, and Christmas season...which, btw, starts officially on Friday.
