Well just listen,   Sometimes,  You gotta' set free what you love just to bring it back Would you ever lose me? Would you ever let go for that?  And if the love is real you gotta' let yourself go,  Just to bring it back.   Sometimes,  Just to bring it back.  Hiding inside my asylum i'm always,  Hanging on by a thread.  I can't ecpect you to respect me until i've,  Learned to respect myself.  I've let you down you've lost your taste,  I'm losing ground i miss your face.  Well just listen,  well just listen,   Sometimes,   Sometimes,   You gotta' set free what you love just to bring it back Would you ever lose me?  Would you ever let go for that?  And if the love is real you gotta' let yourself go,  Just to bring it back.   Sometimes,  Just to bring it back.  I've let you down you've lost your taste,  I'm losing ground i fall from grace.  Well just listen,   Sometimes,   Sometimes,   Sometimes,   You gotta' set free what you love just to bring it back Would you ever lose me?  Would you ever let go for that?  And if the love is real you gotta' teach yourself,  Just to bring it back.   Sometimes,  Just to bring it back.  Oh the love you're bringing back.  Oh the love you're bringing back.   Sometimes,   Sometimes,  Just to bring it back.  You gotta' let go.
