Am I true? Did the things I said I’d never do All that faith and luck and trust If it’s not real it turns to rust It turns me on when you say your mine All the things I thought I’d never find Your attention has it’s price But it’s never bark no biteI can’t stand the way you tell it Turns me on when you turn me down Everything inside me turns around Give me faith and love and trust Or just crush me into dust I’m not afraid to pay your price Because you’re never bark no bite   What I know still exists:   Cumbersome  she calls me goliath and i wear the david mask i guess the stones are coming too fast for her now you know I'd like to believe this nervousness will pass all the stones that are thrown are building up a wall I have become cumbersome to this world I have become cumbersome to my girl I'd like to believe we could reconcile the past resurrect those bridges with an ancient glance but my old stone face can't seem to bring her down she remembers bridges, burns them to the ground I have become cumbersome to this world I have become cumbersome to my girl too heavy too light, too black or too white, too wrong or too right, today or tonight cumbersome too rich or too poor, she's wanting me less and I'm wanting her more the bitter taste is cumbersome there is a balance between two worlds one with an arrow and a cross regardless of the balance life has becomecumbersome   What it is:   She's got a ticket but you need more than a ticket to get you there You need a string of good intentions and an easy burn Maybe some good luck with the cash tucked in the back of your pocket Maybe it's still not enough to ease your pain you get tired and say fuck it Each little mystery is safe in your heart you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do? Need to have a little conversation Find the truth behind the questions that are haunting you She says there's motivationtucked into the crease between the seats I looked through the box for cigarettes, maps, keys There's so much room in hereyou can put your feet straight out the dash She turns the radio on pulls me close to hear me laugh Each little mystery is safe in your heart you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do? Need to have a little conversation Find the truth behind the questions that are haunting you She rests her hand along the space between my neckline and my back I can feel her fingers runnin' through the feelingsI didn't think I had. Likemaybe this road we're on is the very thing that's come between us maybe it's the highway to the very place that might just save us Each little mystery is safe in your heart you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do? Need to have a little conversation Find the truth behind the questions that are haunting you Each little mystery is safe in your heart you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do? I hear you've got a little education It's not enough to satisfy what's haunting you
