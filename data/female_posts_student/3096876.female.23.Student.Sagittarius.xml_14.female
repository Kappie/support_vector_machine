Dr. Friedrich Bischinger, an Innsbruck-based lung  specialist, said people who pick their noses with their fingers were healthy,  happier and probably better in tune with their bodies. He says society should  adopt a new approach to nose-picking and encourage children to take it up, the Ananova Web site reported. "With the finger, you can get to places you just can't reach with a handkerchief, keeping your nose far cleaner," he said. "And eating the dry remains of what you pull out is a great way of strengthening the body's immune system." Children happily pick their noses, yet by the time they have become adults they have stopped under pressure from society that considers the practice disgusting and unclean. His advice? Pick your nose in private.    So, my little cousins were right???
