But yes, what an awesome day. Free cookies, awesome band class, hokey-pokey at lunch time!! Hooray for being the special guest! I never knew you guys did that before haha.. It made my day. That and the fact that our band sub knew every Pink Floyd song on piano so me and Lauren sat there after band class, him playing piano, me singing along.. Lauren looking very amused/bewildered. It was amazing.. Then well ancient history was alright, whatever, and then I walked home with Lauren Brad and Jillian IN THE SUN!! Only Lauren will understand how amazing that was.  Anyway, so I ended up going to bed yesterday at 6:00 PM! And slept till 7 this morning. Lets count how many hours that was..13, if my math is correct [and its most likely not.]  Thats a lot of sleep. But it was good. And the whole sunniness.. ahh I love it. Now if only Behn was here, then it would be stellar.  Funniest thing in gym class.. Ennett wants me to try out for the womans touch league in the fall or something haha! Cheers for extra gym marks.. which I need since the gym exam :S haha. Anyway touch is no fun anyway, you need the whole kicking of ass and tackling and all that. Thats what football is after all. Well thats what my dad taught me :)  Cant wait for the long weekend.. but this week is actually going by pretty quickly. Wednesday already, 2 more days then work, work, and BEHN! I cant wait. And its a long weekend and everything! So I get to sleep in monday morning!!! therefore making it a good monday! AH, what a great day!! Im talking to Cory about how people should be more open minded and its making me very excited! I never use exclamation marks!  Im going outside, and you should too!   Listening To: Disco Inferno- Bee Gees  [stop that laughing!its making me dance]  Word Of The Day : kinky
