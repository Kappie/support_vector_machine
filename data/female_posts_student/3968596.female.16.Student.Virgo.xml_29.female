She asked me questions about what I thought of the college admissions process and what i was doing to prepare for it. And she said she would ask her editors if it would be okay to photograph me for the article!!!! I started jumping around my room, shouting out exclaimations of excitement (when we hung up of course---I didn't want her to think I was crazy or anything...)  The reason why she called me was because I participated in the 2004 P-E Journalism Boot Camp. They didn't make us run laps or do push-ups. It was a work shop that taught teens, who were interested in journalism, about the whole business, how to get in it, how to interview, ways to improve our writing, etc. For a week I came to the Press-Enterprise office and stayed from 9 a.m. till 5 p.m. to be around professional journalists and learn from them. There were also GREAT luncheons. And they gave us bootcampers porfolios with notepads for interviewing, an AP style manual, and other goodies.  So when Kim (the reporter) e-mailed for a list of names that she could use as sources for her article, I casually slipped in that I too was going to be a senior going off to college next year...which just proves that you should never waste an opportunity!!!
