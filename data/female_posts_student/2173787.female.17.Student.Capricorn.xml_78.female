Yet still it eludes me to haunt my thoughts and actions, at least on this night.  The are no words to set it to, no way to express this sense of lost chances and emptiness.  It builds and builds and then suddenly seems to be banished from my thoughts.  It never goes far though, always waiting for a quiet calm moment to strike.  In an attempt to pretend it doesn't exist I move onto lighter subjects.  I have decided not to sleep tonight and instead to clean my room.  With exams and my natural tendency towards disorder it has turned to chaos and treachery.  I had nightmares last night of natural disasters and trying to escape through the piles of clutter.  They reached out from their clumps and latched onto me dragging me to the floor to succumb to whatever disaster was upon us.  Yet when I awoke this morning I chose to ignore the mess, as I have for the past 2 weeks, and it still exists.  Hence the need to clean...That and maybe I can work off this mood.  At the very least it's worth the work.
