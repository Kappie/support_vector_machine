I've been up til 3 on the phone for the last two nights... hm... Maybe that's why I'm tired. I watched West Side Story last night... I love that movie, it's like the best movie ever. I didn't finish it... Maybe I'll do that tonight. Wait I gues I'm supposed to sleep over at Rachael's with Caitlin and Amanda.. but I'm too tired :| -_- maybe I'll go and just come home late. Today was Nick's surprise b-day party, he wasn't incredibly surprised but it was fun anyways. Woo... I'm sleepay.
