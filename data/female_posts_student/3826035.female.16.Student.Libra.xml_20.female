And I think it's the best desicion. I can't afford to screw up again. I need to make something of myself, and the way I'm going, it's not going to happen.  Thus, I announce that I will not be returning to Victoria next year, but I will do all my schooling at home through St. Gabriels, online.  It's for the best. I need to buckle down for the next two years, with no distractions. This way I will be able to finally write my damned book, and I can get a good job.  I sat down with mom, and she said with all the money I'll save on transportation costs that usually go towards bus passes, (600$ a year), she'll take me to England and Ireland for a month or two after my surgery in a couple years, once I've recovered well enough.  I love all of you people at Vic, and you've been my family for two years. I thank you all for what you've done for me. I'll come visit as often as I can, and good luck to you all in the coming school year.
