I'm not sure how I felt about our presentation, people said we did good, but I felt a bit lame, and somewhat disappointed. I wish we'd had more group cohesion. I think it could have been better.  Now I'm off to the RMS winter encampment. After I posted earlier about not really wanting to go, Jerm got a bug up his butt and got all excited and enthusiastic about going. He even built a rope bed this week, which I must admit I'm a bit nervous about. Apparently it's an old Byzantine design, and is quite clever. I think Jerm has found his niche in the history world: historical engineering. People have been clever for a long time, and came up with some inventive solutions to design and stuctural problems. But now we're going to sleep in it, so we'll see how well he followed the design!  Thanks for the few emails of those of you who've checked this thing out. At some point I'm going to move this to Jerm's server and add some more features, like a comments section. I'll be gone all weekend, I'll write again on Monday.
