Maybe seeing too many blogs have influenced me to have a blog of my own. So here I'm am, creating a blog of my own :)  I'm feeling very lethagic, and this has been going on since poly started. Even after awaking from 12 hours of sleep, I still feel tired. I guess I'm still not use to schooling again after close to 8 months of slacking and enjoying life without school. I  need  my sleep and I  want  my sleep!   I'm back to hearing X Japan songs. After  Tears  kept playing in Windstruck, I started missing X Japan songs. They are a  good  band, wonderful music, especially the drums and guitar parts. Their english is horrible, but then... they are a Japanese band, oh well. If only hide didnt pass away in '98, then we could be still hearing good music as Yoshiki had wanted to "revive" another X in 2000. Damn.  Currenly playing: Tears - X Japan
