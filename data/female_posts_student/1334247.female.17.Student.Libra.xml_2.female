First of all, I found out that I only got 4 hours this week and 4 hours next week, so I am once again applying for different jobs, praying that one of them will hire.   Now, to the bad news. I was in my last class on Friday and I got called to the office. The secretary told me that some woman called to tell me that Matthew couldn't take me to the game that night. So, I went back to class, not thinking anything of it. 10 minutes later they said on the intercom that everyone should obey all the stop signs on the new highway by Argyle because there was a wreck. I got the pit in my stomach thinking it was Matthew, because he has to cross that road. Sure enough, after class I had a voicemail from his mom saying that he was in the hospital because he got hit my a SEMI!!!! OH, I was so scared. I called her back up and she said that he was fine, he was getting tests and X-Rays and all that stuff. So I went home instead of going to practice and Mom called the hospital (a friend of hers answered and told her everything that happened-he ran a stop sign because he was going too fast and skidded into a passing semi and got thrown from his car while the semi took off the front end of the car.) He's ok though...no serious injuries, just a ton of cuts and scratches and bruises-his face is really bad by his eye. He had to stay with me (at dad's) yesterday and today though because his parents went to chicago yesterday. So, we're babying him over here.   Now, the good news...C-Force got Grand Champions at West Burlington yesterday. We rock.
