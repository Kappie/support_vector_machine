You would think they're carefree, I have seen their trials, Frowning into Shakespeare and practicing their smiles, With every new idea, wondering if they've changed at all, Then they turn away, it happens every day.  - Dar Williams,  The Green World    I want to talk about responsibility. Oftentimes, I feel that pressure of responsibility, the higher moral obligation to make the world a better place for us to live. There are those individuals who mock my idealistic desires, but for me, being an optimist is the only way to survive in this crazy place. My faith in Godde prevents me from becoming the World's Greatest Cynic. I am a natural optimist, always wanting to see the good in people and their motivations, and I feel absolutely no shame about that fact.  Mother Teresa stated that, "In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love." Indeed, it is the small things that make the most difference. The environment is a good example of this point and I have made it a part of said higher obligation to protect the space in which I live. I drive a car that gets good gas-mileage and has the lowest emissions rating in the country. I car-pool to places when it is possible. I recycle paper, plastic, aluminium, and glass products. I take my own shopping bags, made out of thick cloth, to the grocery store and if I am forced to use the plastic bags, I keep and re-use them to carry my lunch to work during the week.  Perhaps it is naive of me to be so sure that my actions, alone, can change the world. Certainly, other people think in such terms. On more than one occasion, I have been labeled as a  bleeding heart , a  touchy-feely liberal , and a  hippie tree hugger . I have grown immune to such attempts at attacking my desire, my need, to keep this place clean. I refuse to believe that it is a bad thing to want to leave something beautiful for those who, years after I am gone, will walk this land. Godde did not give us this land to plunder with shameless abandon. When you rape the land, you are, for all intents and purposes, raping Godde, because  She is the land . This type of language, this violent metaphor, is harsh, but true. I am a firm believer in honesty, a trait which far too many individuals have lost sight of and no longer value. We are tied to this place. We are tied to Her. If we, as a society, destroy our planet, then we will be destroying the gift that Godde gave to us. We will be destroying our own lives, the lives of our children, and Godde Herself.
