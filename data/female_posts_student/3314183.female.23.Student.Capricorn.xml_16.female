Or is it worse to be feeling sucky and have nothing to do?  Maybe the bad dreams were a sign. But I just refuse to believethe sign.  Ok maybe now I should start believing. Everything's going off track.  Everything and everyone. Geez. Trapped right here. Can't breathe. Suffocating.  Disoriented. Seeing pepz starting school. Phobia. Arrghs..  Aaarghhhs.. him.. him again.. when can I ever be done with him..  4 months of hols ain't enuff to get him out.. geez.. restless today..  Quiet phone - squirmy. Him - disturbing.  -Nose pierce- hurt. sad. wounded. How?  -me- Out of tune. Berserk. Cranky. Life sux. Bad day.  Okay. Its gona get better later. Maybe its jus pms.
