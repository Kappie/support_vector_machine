Anyways, so I walked to the library. I was like Dora the freaking Exploradora! I hate that girl! I like Maggie and the Ferocious Beast- GREAT GOOGLEY MOOGLEY! Last night I had this really scary dream. I was Harry Potter and I was dueling with Voldemort in the backyard of the pets that I'm watching. I kept wanting to just give up, so I could go and be with Sirius and my parents, but I knew that if I died Voldemort could come back fully to power, because the prophecy says that only one of us can live. I had to keep fighting, but I was so mad at Dumbledore for lying to me that I just wanted to hand in the towel. And my guilt for Sirius' death was really bad. It was an INTENSE dream!
