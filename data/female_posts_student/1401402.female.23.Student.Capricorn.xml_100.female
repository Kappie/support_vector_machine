Did YOU know that others know what I did not know that love is blind? An old friend has just recently gotten in touch with me after two years of her disappearance. Today I want to blog about her!    She told me that she’s with a guy who treats her kinda fucked up, I would say as a living hell, whose three years younger then she is, who has a donut shop which she is working for but doesn’t get pay. She’s broke and its no joke. She has asked me to help her find a job. That she is very bored and wanted to go out with me sometimes. She also wanted to reach old friends from high school, she wanted to call and say hi.   I’ve got in contact with several agencies, trying to help this girl get a job of her dream. The entire agency asked for was for her to come in and take a test and turn in her updated resume. That’s basically it!!! I really don’t know whats who with her, she’s just so lazy in doing her part. I did my part and that’s all I really can do for her. It isn’t my fault.   I’ve got connect to everyone whom she wished to speak with. Now her so so called boyfriend thinks I’m just trying to break them up. He thinks that I am trying to find a new boyfriend for her. And that I am a very bad influence for her. We cant go out clubbin just as we plan this weekend because of his ignorance selfish dumb ass self.  He wishes for her never to conversant with me ever again.    I think he’s abuses her when ever she talked back to his face. She once told me that and that he’s always doing her wrong. She also mention to me that he would always pushes her out of his way numerous of time. Why is she living in hell with him? Why doesn’t she see that his just messing her life up? Why does she let him do so much harms to her? Why is she still with him?  She is now living with him, with his family in one house. His parents don’t even like her because she’s only got a high school diploma. They look down at her so low because she is living with them. You all know that Cambodian families are very strict once it comes to this.  Why does she do this to herself? Why? Why allow others to look down at you? Why allow others to treat you like trash? Why be at a place where there is no happiness? I don’t get it!!!  I don’t get it!!! I’m not so strong myself but I did what I could to survive. I’ll do what ever it takes to get myself in a better position, a better relevant, and a better stage. I think about my future more than I ever did. If I find myself not happy, I move on and look for more that god has to offer. I just wish Phira is okay without my guide. I did what I could to help. I just hope that one day she would open her eyes and see what god has to offer her. I just wish that she, one day will be happy for what she have. All that I am wishing for is for her to be happy but not the life she is living rite now. I want her to have a better life with a better future. I want her to know that I am always here for her.
