I will never forget my innocence and young confusion. Why would anyone do this?  Still in my head I can picture the house.I can clearly remember my first steps inside and how it all felt like a movie. I guess it hasn’t been until almost this moment that I have forced myself to look upon this in any other way than how it is in my memory. I can now see the dramatic impact that this event had on not only me but my entire family’s life. 	 A lot of questions arose that day. How could you be robbed in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon on a main street? What reasons did they have not to take our main appliances the Nintendo the TV? Why had they targeted my mums one – off jewellery? That day influenced a lot of change. It was the first time I had heard slanderous comments from my father towards my mother, the first time I had understood secrets may lie beneath my family’s surface and it was probably among one of the first times I questioned the way the world worked. But the irony lies in my original reaction. “Shit my CD players gone”  That year was a fairly miserable one. Two days after Christmas all my presents were stolen, along with my sense of security. My first CD player was a big deal. My friend since birth, god sister, and best mate and I had received the same one. I had played with hers but was not yet to put a CD in mine, and it was gone. I was devastated, shattered as all my jewellery and my expensive materialistic items were gone. I was too young and naïve to see the big picture though, my real loss. My sense of security.  I can still remember how cold that first night was. A chilly breeze glided through the house as our front door was broken and refused not only to lock but to even shut. I remember not being able to sleep properly. I remember awakening only to the screeching of angry adult voices …my parents, well my mum and stepfather they were angry, but not at the fact we had been robbed. They were angry with each other!  The screaming and yelling I heard during these nights will stay in my memories forever. I honestly thought that they were going to break up and I would be left again with my mother.  The time was odd. The police believed that it was the arrival of my father and I that had warned the burglars away. But I myself didn’t like that idea, for it meant that they were there when I was a very chilling thought.  The absence of my logical thinking was clearly present at the time. I couldn’t even remember the police phone number. And yet it was on the damn phone, as a big sticker. I remember searching through my room, happy that most of my stuff remained. My TV was there, my “treasures of the earth gem collection” remained but more importantly my new CD’S. Only now I had nothing to play them in.  Although at the time it was a fairly traumatic experience, a lot of good things did arise from the situation. Over the following few months it appeared that  Mum and Dad resolved some issued that they had seemingly been hiding from each other for quite some time. My sister and I became closer as we were forced to move house and share a room. Even though we were at each others throats all the time I know that our bond grew. 	 And I guess I was forced to grow up. I had to be strong as it seemed everything and everyone around me was falling apart. But maybe the most relevant thing to me at the time that changed was that I filled my ever since birth, kind of god sister and really good friend with absolute envy. I had received a new CD player. It had a three disc spin and it was better than hers. And I could play with it whenever I wanted.
