And it's all because of stupid guests attacking my friends. ='o(  It kills me when my friends are upset and there's nothing I can do...      Well, it's 3pm right now... I got home 2 and a bit hours ago.. I'm so glad the Society assignment's out of the way now.. I should've started the Religion assignment when I got home, but nyehh.       OMG, the heats for the talent show are either tomorrow or next Friday.. I'm not prepared!!! I still don't know what to sing!!! *starts hyperventilating* *stops* *goes to make another ham and cheese sandwich*      *comes back* Listening to "A Day In The Sun" by Hilary Duff... I'm just remembering how much I love this album.. Even though Hil's singing ability isn't anything super-stellarly-special, I still love the tracks. *switches to Come Clean*  It's been raining lately, which is good news for those who need rain, but bad news for me. It'd be good if I could go out and dance and splash in puddles like in a movie montage, but no. *ahem*      I know this sounds so totally gross, but the scab on my face came off! I'm so happy because I can see that the wound is getting much better. I'm getting closer to having a normal face again! ("Who said your face was normal before?")      I'm gonna go. >oP
