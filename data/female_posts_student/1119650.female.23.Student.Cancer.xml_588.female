I mean I know I am leaving this job to go to back to  urlLink school , but I haven't told them yet, and I haven't gotten the entire ball of wax rollin' on the whole scheduling thing for work so I feel sort of stuck here.  I'm not motivated to do much here, because I know come July 1st (yes, I pushed up the date) I'll be outta here, but at the same time I'm so bored that I feel obligated to at least do  something .    In a weird way I feel like I'm falling into some sort of a rut, I'm not sure if its good or bad, but my life seems to be the same thing everyday now: wake up at 6:30, drive home, shower, work, track with Billy, go home, shower and possibly eat at home, go to the boy's apartment, rinse and repeat.  Its fun and all, but I definitley think its gonna result in me ending up lazy and fat again.  Maybe its just because I'm getting a little stir crazy and I need to be out and about come spring.  Maybe I need to hang out with some of my other friends every once in a while.  Well, I  do  see Adam weekly, but everyone else is left behind.  Who knows.
