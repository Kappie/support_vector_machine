I stayed up last night going through clothes and stuff trying to figure what looks the cutest on me. I chose to wear things that I wear everyday, you know my style  baggy pants nice t-shoes, belt nice shirt,bandana, and hat cocked to the side bc I am pimptress lol. And of course all my braclets that I wear. It is 4 hours away til I see her and I am nervous as a mug. I can't wait to see her though OH my god I am so happy to see her. I hope she likes her b-day/anniversay gifts!!! I hope she likes me after she sees me lol. I hope still thinks i am cute. I hope her friends like me and think i am good enough for her. I need to hop pf though because i need to get all cute and smelling fresh for her so I guess that is all for today guys I LOVE YOU SWEETHEART SEE YOU SOON
