Helle yesseth!  As to being worthless, or good enough...I figure Linds wouldn't continue to date someone a thousand years away if he wasn't good enough, at least for her. Perhaps we have cause for misgiving, but that's no reason not to have a bit of trust.  My mom made a point the other day, that when someone breaks your trust, it's damn near impossible to get it all back. I dunno if I like the idea but it seems fairly reasonable on some level. Like, they may seem to get it all back, but you'll still be subconciously looking over your shoulder.   Unprovable, yes, very pessimistic, also a yes. True? I think so, as sad as that is. Trust is one of those things people look for to survive. If someone has stabbed you in the back before, what's to stop them from doing it again? Circumstance, yes. But should there ever be a great reason for us, doing no wrong, to be betrayed by those we trust in?  Rhetorical questions are awesome, but they haven't been effective since "give me liberty...". I think people have just become too smart for that kind of persuasion. Or too stubborn to think, rather. In any event:    This is the end of the post
