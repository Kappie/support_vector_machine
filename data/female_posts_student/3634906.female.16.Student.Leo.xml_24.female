I really wanted to get up and do something conventional in the morning hours while it is still cool, but it didnt happen. Maybe tomorrow. But even though I went to bed early I ended up reading more of the bible, because I'm crazy, and writing in my journal so actually I was up until 1:00. Which is really late to me. Oh well.    Well I need to shower because I smell bad and my hair is all over. Then I am going to call Emily and see what she is up to today and if she is busy I think I will take myself for a little walk. Maybe I'll stop up by Boz's if I walk that far or maybe I will call some random person. Who knows? Well I'm going now   -gabby
