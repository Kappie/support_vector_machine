Lets talk about things I hate, fun subject, eh?  Yes, so birds, I hate birds.  If it were up to me I would take out every last one of their incessantly chirping lives and send them to a place where forgiveness is historically more prevalent and free-flowing than from myself.  Austria in my officially unofficial opinion is overwrought, if I had an A.K. I would really be doing them quite a large favor.  In fact if the rest of the world suddenly went into bird-extinction, Austria could compensate.  Okay, so I would not really go Rambo on the birdies, but Yes I am thinking about it.  Have you ever noticed that birds only chirp, or squawk (depending on your personal outlook towards birds), during times when you are trying to read Bankruptcy (and are thus readily distractable) or when you would really like a bit of sleep.  Plus they are like WWII bombers, you can never really feel safe unless you are inside.    Okay I'm playing with my dad's camera now...picture time
