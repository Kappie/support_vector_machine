I admit that in the past I've been a nasty  They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch  But you'll find that nowadays  I've mended all my ways  Repented, seen the light and made a switch  True? Yes!   And I fortunately know a little magic  It's a talent that I always have possessed  And here lately, please don't laugh  I use it on behalf  Of the miserable, lonely and depressed  (Pathetic)   Poor unfortunate souls  In pain  In need  This one longing to be thinner  That one wants to get the girl  And do I help them?  Yes, indeed  Those poor unfortunate souls  So sad  So true  They come flocking to my cauldron  Crying, "Spells, Ursula please!"  And I help them?  Yes, I do   Now it's happened once or twice  Someone couldn't pay the price  And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals  Yes, I've had the odd complaint  But on the whole I've been a saint...  To those poor unfortunate souls   (...)(...)  Come on, you poor unfortunate soul  Go ahead!  Make your choice!  I'm a very busy woman  And I haven't got all day  It won't cost much:  Just your voice!   You poor unfortunate soul!  It's sad,  But true!  If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet  You've got to pay the toll  Take a gulp and take a breath  And go ahead and sign the scroll!    Poor Unfortunate Soul, The Little Mermaid!
