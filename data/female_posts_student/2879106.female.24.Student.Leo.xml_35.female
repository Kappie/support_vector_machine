I won't go into all of the juicy details with you but I can say that we just had a blast!!! Other than just spending time with Alek I also saw Nicole today. We went out to lunch, then to Value City and then to the Book and Music Exchange. We had so much fun and dida lot of catching up. Granted we see each other once a week but in that week so much always happens. Anyway, that's not the point of the story. The point is that I am looking to move out come December. I have someone in mind for a roommate who will be wanting to move out about the same time I do, but for right now I am not going to name names in order to not jinks things. So I have to start thinking about saving and figuring out a plan of action. I have been making the first steps in the last couple of days. I have talked things over with my mom and we have figured out a way to save 2000 dollars in the next five months. That will help out a lot when it comes to getting everything ready. I have priced furniture and I have figured out about what I will be able to afford. Plus I have been checking prices on apartments and utilities. I am hoping that with a little planning I can make this really happen. Now I just have to make sure my roommate comes through and everything should be fine. I just can't wait. I wish this five months would just fly by and the semester would be over. Funny that I want the semester to be over before it has even started. HEHEHE Anyway, I guess that's all for now. I will get back with you as soon as I know more.
