By the time I finish my B.A. I won't have any months left on my G.I. Bill.  Enough about that.  So I am trying to develop a plan for my weight issue.  I guess I must not be motivated enough because so far this week I have only worked out once.  I need to find the time.  Maybe I should buy the photos with the fat women on it and post it everywhere around my room.  I have time to work out but then I have been using the time to watch the free movies that I get from the video store I work at.  Maybe I should just work out in the morning.  I wish I were a morning person.  I haven't lost any weight.  I still think I need to cut down on my soda intake even if it is diet.  I need to drink more water.  I am going to have a salad today for dinner.  Maybe I can work out before I go to work tonight.  I do need to fit studying in somewhere tonight also.    Hmm...maybe I should be studying now....  good idea...
