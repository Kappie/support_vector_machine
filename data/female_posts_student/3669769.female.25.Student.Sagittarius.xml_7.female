Yet, it was there waiting to be remembered,  This sad little memory. A time when I was happily bundled in forbidden love.  Waiting far too long  For something I forgot was wrong.  Society was such a cold, uncaring fool,  Forcing me to unwrap myself from love's warmth  And find another better suited to It's choosing.  Remembering the way I felt then  And realizing how I feel now  I recognize how stupidly I threw away happiness...forever?  Miserable, I sit here listening to my regret,  Fearing that I'll never love again , And push repeat.   2000-by me -Quotes from Until I Fall Away by the Gin Blossoms.
