Everyone believes in different things.  Everyone  thinks they are right. No one knows for sure. No one, Micah. Christianity is no different from other religions in terms of belief. Do you not think other religions have holy sacred documents and shit too? I could sit here and argue about my truths, and what I believe in.. But I won't. There is no point. No one is going to change from one of our rants, so we might as well waste time on something else.So did you catch my drift? If not, here it is, condensed: Shut the hell up about your stupid religions, no one wants to hear it.
