So what if they think negative about you. i hate when people get all worked up when they find out someone hates them. OH MY GAWD! THEY DONT LIKE U? suck it up princess. not everyone is gonna like u in this world. you'll never be perfect.. like me. ha ha well ive been having an ok kinda week. oh wait.. its monday the week just started.. SHIIIIIIIIIIIT!  well on another day folks you have reached the end of me   ill leave you with this "The worst is over now and we can breathe again  i wanna hold you high and steal my pain away Theres so much left to learn  And no one left to fight I wanna hold u high and steal your pain."  -SEETHER FT.
