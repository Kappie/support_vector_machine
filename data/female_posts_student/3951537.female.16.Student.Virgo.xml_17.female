"this is goodbye." "goodbye diane." she walks out. sam turns to chase after her, but doubles back. diane's feet are shown through the window turning back down the stairs. she pauses, then goes on her way, leaving cheers. END OF EPISODE.  i mean, what the fuck?!? seriously! who ends a mini-marathon that way?!?! WHAT HAPPENS?!?! what annoys me the most is that they won't pick it up where it left off. i'm not gonna see the emotional make-up and catharsis. boy meets world wasn't on tonight. AT ALL. and also, will everyone please stop pointing out that i can't talk?! what is with you? sure, it's funny that i can't pronounce some things. acctually, it's really funny. but not when you make me say them over and over and over and over and over. it's ok if i deserve it, and am like "hah you dork, you just said 'supercalifradulisticSEXpialadsious!.'" then you can say "hey emily, say 'magician!'" but if you're just bored and feel like being an ass, leave me and my inability to speak alone. here, you can even just use this little helpful list and pretend i'm there saying it.   words i apparently can't say:  inner turmoil = inner toimoil magician = madician (i'm not the kind of magician who does magic tricks, i'm a mathemagician! -simpsons, 'grade school confidential') cupon = cuepon  if i say anything else wrong, please point it out. CURSE YOU NICKELODEON FOR ENDING ON SUCH A TERRIBLE NOTE!!! CURSE YOU!!!!!!  it's not that it was a bad episode. it was a great episode. ("my favorite episode. but you can be a real cunt sometimes. how do i look?" "....you look ready.") but why would they end a mmini-marathon on that episode? are they insane? the ross and rachel of cheers are over, because of a believeable situation, not "we were on a break so i slept with someone," but an actual, real-life kind of reason, and a real-life kind of break-up, and she acctually left. you don't know if she's really coming back. you  always  knew rachel would be back. from the pilot episode you knew they'd end up together. when she got on that plane you knew she'd be back. but diane is  gone.  she probably comes back. it's happened before. but not like that. damn it, the show's over, and i could just read what happened online, but i want to see! not that it really matters. coach dies, woody comes around, and that new boss lady shows up. diane has to be gone at some point. but damn it, i want to see the episode that comes right after the two-parter i just saw. and i most likely never will.
