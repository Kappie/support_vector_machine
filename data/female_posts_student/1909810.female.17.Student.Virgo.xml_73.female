I love it, I am reading it for English right now, and it's good.  I've decided that if I ever have a child, her name is going to be Turtle.   We get the cast list for Peace tomorrow, I'm excited, a little nervous, but excited.   And I think Barb liked the rape recovery scene that I wrote, it just needs to be expanded a bit.  I gave her the peace website address so she can look at it and decide if it would be cool for peace to have a website.  Yeah, not too exciting, but considering it's the only lame hobby I have... I have no idea how I was planning on ending that sentence.  Hmm.    I have a test tomorrow, didn't study, but I'm not too worried about it. Well...I'm going to go watch the lovely local news now.
