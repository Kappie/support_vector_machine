He had told me that he was going to be visiting Camp Doha for some computer training and I am almost sure that that is what he has been up to these last few days. I am sure whatever he is doing he is safe though. I am assuming so since I haven’t heard anything otherwise.   I know in my case I probably know more than I should regarding my husband’s whereabouts but it’s not like I ask him, he tells me. And I really don’t repeat anything that I shouldn’t because he doesn’t tell me the things I shouldn’t know about, any thing top secret. I just hope he is ok.   It has gotten to the point where I really have stopped counting the days. I know Jesse has been in Kuwait for just around 2 months, which really isn’t a long time but her hasn’t been home in over 5 months and that is the longest I have ever been away from him. Counting the day’s just makes it seem worse for me. I hardly ever really look at calendars anymore.   I try to avoid family functions where I know “How’s Jesse?” will be asked. I have to fight back tears sometimes and am really getting quite good at faking a realistic smile. The fact of the matter is that I really miss Jesse and everything about him, from all of the good things, all of the romantic things, right down to all of the crude and yucky things (like his belching – those who know Jesse understand that one). I often think of how wonderful that day will be when I am waiting for him to get off that plain and to run right up to me and give me the biggest hug and kiss he has ever given me. The look on his face when he sees me waiting for him but then I remember how far away all of this is and I have to wonder if the time will really pass quickly or very slow, like it seems to lately.  All I can do is hope to keep busy and keep my mind off of the things that make me sad, like missing him.  Jesse if you read this, I love you!
