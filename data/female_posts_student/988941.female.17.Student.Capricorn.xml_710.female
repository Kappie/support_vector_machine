I should probbably read all the blogs that I've missed, but to be honest I'm too tired to faff around with it! Holiday was great, I'll tell you all individually if ya want to know instead of boring all of you who don't want to know, but the basis was it was great, 40 degrees everyday, blah blah! Yeah. Um. I'm not really looking forward to Thursday (obviuosly), but I am in the aspect that we get to see all our friends together again, various people have organised parties and dinners and stuff which should be good! I was wondering if our gang are meeting up somewhere and all going up to school together, or whether that will be too stressful for some people? Let me know if anyone has, and I shall be there! Well got to go, mein vater is cooking me an omlete! Tah tah!"
