I find nothing wrong with any of these views or ways especially if your looking for marriage.But I on the other hand are one of the percentage that are often looked apon as the insensitive ones. i cant say they all arent but why is it that way. just because they dont give themselves (their hearts) completely during the many relations you might encounter I for one am not one to date but one person. as one of my best friends extremely wonderful mom told me you date for the experience so you can find what type of person you want to spend the rest of your life with. so do people that think like that need to change their views just because they can see the realisticness in things the fact that ya you probably will break up and ya it will hurt if you ever had any feeling. thats just life i dont dwell on it, im just ever mindful is there anything wrong with that?? I want someone to have fun with so laugh and go places with to know they are always there not a soul mate.... not now thats for the future. and you know it might seem like im afraid to get hurt, but i dont think thats it, its the fact that i would rather be the one to shoulder all the hurt if the other person could go free feeling nothing more than a mere sting. My sentiments and my emotions are the one part of my being that i actually have all figure out! i cant say much for the rest of me im a loony bin :)
