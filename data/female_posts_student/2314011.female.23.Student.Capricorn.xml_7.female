Still can't quite define what that something is, but it's along the lines of: "You're not good enough/You're not what I expected and I resent that/You're not in charge here/You don't get to be you here."  I'm sure I'm being completely overdramatic, but jesus fucking christ!  And it always happens while we're shopping and I won't let her buy me something I don't like/want/need.   Today it was in TJ Maxx.  For some damn reason she's on this luggage kick.  Has been since last year.  I have two fucking sets of luggage, but I need a middle size.  She was on it last year because I was traveling to London, at least there was some context.  But it was there again this year...whatever.  So, of course, I very gently tried to tell her that no, I still don't need another piece of luggage.   "You always say that," she said, as if I was deliberately trying to ruin her fun. "Well, it never changes," I replied, trying to explain why I still don't need it, and trying to figure out what the hell this was about, not thinking it was a big deal. She sighed, walked away and said over her shoulder: "I can see shopping with you is going to be sooo fun....like always."  As though I'd just insulted her.  I couldn't believe it.  "Ditto/Excuse me?!/What does that mean?"  All ran through my head at the same moment, but I couldn't get any of them out.  Instead, I just sealed myself off and followed her to the sock section where I picked out three new pair.   Then we didn't really talk for the rest of the outing.  We drove by the new house my grandparents bought, talked about what a mess that is and all, but we weren't really talking.  Still aren't.    WHAT THE FUCK???  It's never been any different.  And I know one of these times one of us will say something, but good fucking god, I just wish I knew what the damn deal is.
