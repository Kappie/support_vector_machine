I'm coming to your's at some point tomorrow (did you ask Kerry about that thing for me?)  so you may get it back depending on how embarrasing it is to ride through town with (no it wasn't Akira).  The Ext Eng (no i haven't started I am starting in about 10mins) question is:  "Establishing a Utopia would be an ideal solution for mankind's poblems." Prepare an argument for or against this topic, basing your arguments and examples on the set texts "Utopia" (I have now lost any hope of getting the whole thing back.....lol) and "Brave New World".  3-5mins.   I am doing for, just to be annoying and difficult seeing as everyone will do against.  I got my room 1/2 set up (the rest of my stuff is lying around outside hehe) and you don't know what extents I had to go to to make sure my parents didn't look in the couch draws (orange ex bed thingo) i literally had to argue with dad over why we shouldn't move the bed thing with the draws taken out. ahh scarey.  Brianna has Avian flu now. AND my nose is soooo sore from all the crappy recycled tissues we have.  Tata peoples. ~benj
