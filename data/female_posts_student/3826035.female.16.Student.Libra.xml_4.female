I can experiment a little more, and I'm developing a new style even. It's very fun now, that I don't have to force myself to draw.   I installed Bitcomet, with which I have been having much fun, downloading all the Malice Mizer movies, the newest episode of 'Le Portrait de Petit Cossette', as well as much Gacktness and other stuffs.    I dedicate this post to theinventor of 100+GB harddrives. You brilliant son of a bitch, you.
