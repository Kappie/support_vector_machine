My mum bought lots of organic fruit today and so I'm also having some of the freshly picked blueberries she got. They taste SO much better than the ones we normally buy from a place like Safeway. She also bought Date cake (my favorite dessert, ever) for tomorrow night when my aunt and uncle come over for dinner and it's homemade so when you look at the ingredients... it's simply dates, granola and cinnamon and not a whole bunch of other crap like it would have if you bought it from some grocery store. When you want to buy organic foods though, it's so much more expensive. So you have to pay more for something healthier. That whole system is fucked.        Work went all right today. We were off at 3 which was nice. The great thing is that I get to listen to music all day. The ones we listened to were The Strokes  Is This It,  Sahara Hotnights  Jennie Bomb,  The Hives  Tyrannosaurus Hives,  Panurge  Throw Down the Reins,  Massive Attack  Mezzanine,  Blur  Think Tank  and a bit off of Keane  Hopes and Fears.  Keane's album is okay... I know people are saying they're similar to bands like Coldplay and Travis but really, I'm sorry to say it, they sound like a poppy British boyband to me. Well, maybe that's kind of harsh. The first song was catchy but meh... I don't know... it didn't blow me away or anything.        There's this song, "Teardrop" on  Mezzanine  that is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life. Everytime I hear it, I picture Sean and I walking down a street, holding hands and just smiling at eachother every so often... that song brings that image to my head, I'm not sure why, it just does. Another absolutely beautiful song is "Sweet Song" off of  Think Tank.  It's one of my favorite Blur songs.        I was so hoping to go see a movie tonight but it turns out that out of all the movies playing:A) I've already seen it once or twice even,B) It looks like crap or C) I've seen it, it was crap, and I wouldn't see it again SO, no movie tonight. I might walk down to ABE's with Kate for dinner though.        All right, so apparently, every person in this world has at leastone other person who looks like them. Now, what if we all have somebody else who thinks just like us? There are bodies timed to give out at the very same second. Thousands. I don't see why there can't be minds also. But, when your body gives out, you die... and when your mind gives out, you die (they just call it  suicide.)         Hm. Random thought brought to you by Sarah. Reading over that, it doesn't make much sense, and I'm not sure where I was going with it either. *shrug*         urlLink  This band    is really awesome. Think happy-indie-pop that makes you feel all good and happy. Not to mention the percussion is a girl tap dancing!           That's all for now I think.
