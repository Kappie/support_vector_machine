Doesn't sound very tiring,huh? Well it is. I just I should start with Thursday. Kyle's dad came and picked me up to spend the day hanging out with none other than.. Kyle! Haha. So I went and didn't end up going home until eleven. We walked to Tim's, we played baseball with Brett (Kyle says I have a pretty good throw for a girl. I told him he does too) and we just hung out. But yeah, I slept for awhile Friday. I was tired. And I knew I was supposed to go to Kyle's sister's dance recital (which is a really huge event-his whole family was there- everyone from grandma to second cousins haha) so Kyle called for me at about 3 and I asked him what I should wear. He told me that it was semi formal so not to dress up too much, but it's not casual. So I wore a black and white skirt and a black blouse and put my hair up. I got to Kyle's house and his sister (who answered the door in all her dance makeup) told me he was downstairs and we hung out a bit before the show, before finally going upstairs where Kyle's mom then ooed and awwed about how cute we both were and how gorgeous I looked and then his sister made the brilliant observation that Kyle and I matched (he was wearing a black shirt with a white tie). All night all his sister's friends and his grandparents and aunts kept pointing out how we matched, it was so embarassing. We went out for dinner, the lot of us after the recital. Kyle and I sat across from each other in a booth with two of his sister's friends. Then Friend A asks Alicia (his sister) if Kyle and I were dating and Alicia yelled across three tables, "KYLE IS SHE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?!" and we just looked at each other, smiled and grabbed hands across the table. He looked lovinly into my eyes, then back at Alicia and said, "She's my fiance". Later on in the evening, Kyle's dad drove us home. It was about 12:30 and we had awhile to wait in the car. Kyle grabbed my hand and we held hands the whole way although we both fell asleep several times.   I got in at 1. I had to wake up at 6 because I had to take the 3 hour trip up to the cottage for work. I worked all day, completely exhausted. My day finally ended and my boss asked me to come in again the next day. That night, Bennet and CJ came over at 11 and demanded we start a fire in the pit. So I figured that'd be okay. But after an hour of campfiring we decided to play hide and seek and were playing until 2:30. I didn't have to work until 11 the next day,but still. I'm tired.  I am now going to sleep.
