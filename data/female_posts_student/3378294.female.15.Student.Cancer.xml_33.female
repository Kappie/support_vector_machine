Some people will probably think it's pathetic etc.. but i hated doing it and i hate it now. i smoked yesterday for the first time in about 2 months and as soon as i had started (although i felt alot less stressed) i was sooo mad at myself. So if anyone wants to be mad, feel free, i am!  DON'T SMOKE!!! IT'S A DISGUSTING HABIT N IT MAKES U SMELL REALLY BADLY N NO BLOKE WILL HAVE YOU IF U DO!!!
