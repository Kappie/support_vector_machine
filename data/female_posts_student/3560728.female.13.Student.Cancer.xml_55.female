Do you ever  open your window just to taste the rain in all it's sweet, faded glory?  Do you ever look in the mirror see what you've become and hide among sheets from the world you've bee beatewn by again?  Do you ever play games with my heart?  Would you ever leave me to bleed in my world of concrete and shadow where I'll be alone with my suicide notes and the ghost of a sick smile playing on my lips?  Do you ever run from decisions let fate make them for you as you just watch the scenery fly by? (green, gray, and aquamarine)  Do you ever  close your eyes and think of the what-if's, the maybe's, and the never-minds or are you just another boy that I've wasted time on?  Do you know  what it is to bleed or to feel so alive?  Yeah, do you ever? Do you know? Did you ever?   *    *    *    *    *  This is a one time offer take it or leave it you decide  I'm not gonna wait forever make up your mind  Do you want me?  You should know by now or do you want me to decide for U? If it comes to that forget it. Just forget about me and all of this.  *    *    *    *    *  Spit out your pleases and your thankyous that's all we want from U.   Now, please keep your mouth closed sweetheart it just overflows with lies you are deceit incarnate.  *    *    *    *    *
