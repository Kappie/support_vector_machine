Definately sticking to the beer...with the occasional Whiskey maybe.  She's right. If you ever meet anyone with an unhealthy obsession with tacky decor and delusions of power then run away. Far away.  Peanut butter and Marmite...greatest snack in this Galaxy and several others.  Ah, but Captain Jack, does it say Captain on your uniform?  Wait, don't you have some way of preventing that? Something about the brain being intact and then they cant bring you back? I'd swear Jacob said somehting about it but...i wasn't really listening. What? Carter and Danny were techno-babbling!  Howdy to the brand-spanking new people!
