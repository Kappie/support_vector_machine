I woke up at like, 11:00, and jessie came to get me, and then we got connor and alex and drove around and bought pieces for alex and jessie (and i got her old one.. woohoo) and then we went to alexs and everyone kept coming and leaving and coming and leaving, and then i had to go...   i dont know what is wrong with me today. Maybe i have a fat personality for only today... im all self-conscious and alone-feeling.  today i felt a way i havent felt for a very long time. i feel stupid, fat, unworthy, and unwanted. i dont know. Maybe i'm just moody cause of my birth control pills. whatever.  i realized today that if i became fat, dylan would dump me and then throw rocks at me or something. Fucking bully. I love him though.   i watched pieces of april today... really really good movie. It reminds me of how my family is so critical of me. I am the first pancake... you know? the one that is all lopsided and half-cooked and falling apart that nobody really wants to eat so they just throw it away and make more...  my aunt is taking me to england. Whee. Today she gave me this "you should dress more conservatively when you travel" and like... i dont know. Something about being in a big city makes me want to be all punk-rocked out. But she said something stupid like ' i love you and accept you BUT the way you dress is completely unacceptable" It was really stupid.  anyway. I'm tired. im going to bed. i love you all.  as is,  ~abby
