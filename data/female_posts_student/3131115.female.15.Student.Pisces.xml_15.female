That's basically everything that happened yesterday.  So, I'm not going to school today. I have stomach pains and such. Today is going to be a long and very ~blah~ day. I'm taking up drawing. I'm actually quite proud of my work. It's no good, but for me...it's good. I'm not good at anything, so ehh...the lines looking decent atleast works for me. I had a dream that my grandma told me that I should look at porn...hmmm. Quite a weird thing to dream about if you ask me, but eh. Thats my head for you.   I love William. I think that I love him too much that it's scaring me. I keep trying to ignore it and back off...but I can't help it. Every time that I see him and hear his voice, I want to be holding him. I wanted him to write in this Blog too, but for some unknown reason he doesnt want to. errr...I wonder why. I can't believe that I missed a day, that's too long. Shame on myself.   The babies are still sleeping. Nibby tried biting me yesterday, probably because I wasnt home all day to hold him and stuff. He's probably mad at me. :( I haven't had time to pick them up as much as I used to. Poor mamas. I want to find some blogs that I can read...but I dont know how. Hmm...My next challenge. Challenge=Not finding a blog...but finding a blog that I like. This could be tough..almost everyone and everything annoys me. Sooo...I'll let you know how that goes. I suppose I'll go do that now.   I dont know how to let you go. I've given to you all of me, all that we'll ever be, we share the same. Heart and soul I want you to believe in me. See through my eyes and you will know, Ill take my chance that you will come home to me. Even if it takes some time for you to work it out, I'll be there. -POD-    Inside I always knew, I'd find my way to you.
