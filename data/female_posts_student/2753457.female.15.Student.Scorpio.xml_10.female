I was like, "GO AWAY, I HATE YOU." But I got up eventually. Ate a grapefruit and listened to the Beta Band (Is there a the? Hmmm.) and my current favorite song, "I Believe" by Stevie Wonder, while I put on my makeup. Can anyone tell I watched "High Fidelity" yesterday?  The morning passed fairly uneventfully. We sang our pretty little song in chorus class and the trumpet song. Whoo. Ha, I fell asleep in health class. Doubt Peoples noticed. I had some lip gloss on, though, and it got smeared all over my glasses. Gross. When I woke up, I was so confused. I didn't know where or who the hell I was. So, I still really out of it in biology five minutes later. This wasn't good, because I had a test today, and not one that I exactly studied for. I was just like, whoooo, DNA! So, yeah. Lunch was pretty fun. We joked around about how I have a problem with eating children. (Where did this cannibalism come from? I really don't eat kids.) And I tried to carry Zak and dropped him. Ooops. I'm really sorry, Zak! But we're still cool. Does anyone know Zak's first period??  Then in C and C, I BSed my way through our quiz. Ha, we'll see how that shit goes. After Kifner's class, Chance, Sarah and I laughed at him (Kifner, not Chance) and talked about how ugly he is. And that his mom is his wife, and that their children would be born covered with fur (I don't remember what that part was about.) and that people should have a license to show before having kids. HAHA, oh my. Anyway, and now I'm here. I saw a little pizza-like thing in the freezer, so it's baking in the oven. Yay.  And now, I will recite a list of things I love (haha, Sarah):  Every one of my friends, illegal music software, my discman, my bed, good clothes, good shoes, my straightener, coca-cola, movies, music, boys, my glasses, AIM, singing, writing in my rainbow journal from Ashley, some aspects of Enloe, our new tv, uhhhh, what else? That's all I can think of now. I'm really shallow at this moment.  I'm gonna go do stuff.
