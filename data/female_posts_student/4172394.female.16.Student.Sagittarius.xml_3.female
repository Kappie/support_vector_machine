(sigh) I have to wait until next year to get the 3rd book in paperback. Oh! I want to get "Da Vinci Code" too, is around $17. Damn, so many things to get but I'm broke! (sulk) Ah, I probably will get my hands on "The Lone Drow" soon. Can't wait!      That game "Doom 3" has the honor of the first game that really spooks me. Fine, I admit, I'm quite a chicken when playing this type of game. That's why I prefer playing RPG's and adventure. Nevermind about that. Ok, I played arounf 20 mins of Doom 3, and that is enough for me. Of course, it didn't help that I played it at night. (my bro suggest I should have played without the lights on!) So now, I'm just an observer watching my bro playes it.      Anyway, is quite scary to have a bunch of moaning zombie surrounding you, with the damn lights flickering. And you don't know when something will jump on you. When you shoot them up close, the blood spattered on the screen. And yesterday, when my brother was playing it, there was this girl whispering away, and then a baby crying at the background. Now, how scary is that? Is pure spooky. Hmm...i might just try my hands on that game again. If I have the time during the day, that is... Lol...
