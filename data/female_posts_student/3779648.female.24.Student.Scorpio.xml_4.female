The plan is for me to stay with Andre at his parents house for about a month until we find an apt of our own:) Im excited for that! And then we havent set an exact date to get married yet but i guess it will probably be early november. I'm hoping, but not expecting, my sister Erin to come and stay through my birthday. I would be so happy if that could happen.   I will be applying for a resident visa which will allow me to live over there when im married for however long i want. I do not have to become a german citizen, and i will not. Not any time soon anyway.. if i feel its the right thing to do years from now (if i have kids or something) i might consider doing that then.   Its kinda funny to think that 50 years ago my grandma was doing this same thing but the other way around! She came here from germany to marry my grandpa. I am glad for that too because we have talked a lot about it, and i now have an insiders point of veiw on it. And i know its not going to be easy.   I'm hoping that maybe i will be able to see my friend Helena again since i know she is living in germany now as well. And hey girl.. if you are reading this.. let me know where you are and how to get ahold of you! You can help me practice my german and i can help with your english.. lol.   Tonight is my cousin Corys coming home party! i havent seen him in like six months so it will be good to see him again:) he was in africa for the national guard doing a bunch of cool shit.   Anyway, i really need to keep updating these things now especially since i wont be around much anymore.
