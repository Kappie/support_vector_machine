I would seriously DIE w/o the internet... Just WAY too dependant on it I guess. Well like if I had stuff to DO I wouldn't miss it. Like if I was at camp or something. But I'm not and this is all there is to do.   Well idk if Rachel's spoken 2 luverboi at all... *cough*Jared*cough* but my mom still doesn't want me 2 be friends with Rachel. OR Carolann OR Heather. Basically she wants me to have NO friends in High School, just like SHE went through it with 1 friend... She LOVES my friends, "just doesn't love their behavior." OK as if APOLOGY ACCEPTED means nothing? That's what friends do. Forgive. But not neccessarily 4get.
