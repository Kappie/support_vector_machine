No classes since it's EDSA anniversary, but i still have to go to school for dance practice. Arrived home just in time for lunch and although the food was great, my appetite wasn't up to eating, i just to go back to sleep and catch of on my beauty rest..(although i really don't need to...)hehehehe.  Oh well, i have to surf the net later for some research, but i can barely open my eyes....zzzzzzzzzzzz... I'll sleep now...Till later...
