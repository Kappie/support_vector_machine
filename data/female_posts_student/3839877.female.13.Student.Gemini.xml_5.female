I've gotten hardly any sleep... Speaking of which, I had an extremely sick dream that I fucked and married one of my male cousins... The one in the dream is non-existant. But its still quite creepy... Right now I fucking feel like killing my parakeet. >. I swear i'm going to kill M. Night Shyamalan. He's such a sell-out, and his movies suck ass major. I hate  Signs . I've taken a bunch more quizzes..  urlLink GO LOOK!  Trying to get Adobe Photoshop CS to work, total pain in the ass. Watched  One Hour Photo  for the thousandth time in my fucked life. So fucking bored... *Hums to herself for whatever reason.*  For a list of fucked things that currently happened in my life.. I slept on my shoulder wrong, aches like hell. Didn't see  The Terminal  as planned, its gone from our theaters already, i'll have to go to a different city to see it. I go see  King Arthur  today/tomorrow instead. ^^ A bit aggrivated, had to skip my bible study today as a result. Thankfully.  I'm half deaf because of a damn song that had weird noises, and I can't find the one I want; Fefe Dobson- Take Me Away.  My grandmother thinks i'm Manson obsessed; Both Charles  Marilyn.  Marilyn; DUH!     Charles; No! Once was. =.= This program isn't working; Guess. My dog is in pain; Flies biting her ears.  I think I'm off to bed...   3:13 AM Watching 28 Days Later. Still bored and really hungry, must eat... Might post in a few, dunno.
