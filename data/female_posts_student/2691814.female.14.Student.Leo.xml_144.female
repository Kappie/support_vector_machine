My parents met this girl i think she's going to be a sophmore next year but, i guess the school is holding auditions for dancers for a dance team. Which they'll be going to the Macy's t-day parade!....i think im interested now lol. Anyway, the warm ups were similar to courtney's so it wasn't very different. crunches, push-ups, stretches. But everyone else in the class just quit doing them half way through, like push ups, everyone quit and like me, this other girl, and the teacher were the only ones left doin them. frankly i dont care about pushups or crunches or situps whatever. But anyway, good news-she said i should go to like level 6jazz/hip hop which is the most advanced until the adult classes. They're not having modern this summer :( thats my fav. But, I'm really sore, i have a hard time sitting down and standing up lol. Atleast it wasn't as bad as the whole week i had classes....chorus,sitting up standing down having to get your friends to almost lift you. But, its worth it to me. I might go to Prestancia with dad(its a golf course) and of course, play golf. I went there today for the first time and its huge!! its sooo cool...but alot of things were the same i mean, c'mon i practically well i did live on a golf course lol. Both dad, and granpa had they're own golf courses. There were alot of nice ppl there too, everyone was just all chatty and smiling. lots of ritzy ppl...and the houses..the houses are amazing...its like a huge resort...well duh, it is sarasota, and it is like the retirment capitol of the world lol j/k. but i mean, it was cool. Sunday we're going to Kasy Key...i love that beach.  I want to see 'The Notebook'..really bad...Ryan Gosling~yummm~
