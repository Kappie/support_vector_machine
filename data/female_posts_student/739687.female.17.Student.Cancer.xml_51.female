Everything is going to hell, and I'm just along for the ride. I guess I'm just really stupid like that. And even when I can admit it, like now, I won't do anything. Then again, my life isn't all that bad right now. But I'm letting everyone down, and that's kinda pissing me off. But I don't even care to try to meet their standards. Meh...I'll learn a lesson from pissing everyone off...and I think that's what I need. Eh. What the hell am I talking about? Wow...ok...bye...
