By that last one I mean that he is all for producing cash, the only thing is that he isn't thinking about the environment or the poor people. A good example would be New York City, over the last two years the rich have gotten richer, but the middle class has started to disappear. Bush's hope with this is that the upper class's wealth will tricke down the economic prymiad. Not really working. Whenever I imagine the president, I imagine a little boy who has made a huge mess in his parents room, but manages to hide everything under their bed so that the don't notice. When the parents come to check up on him, they see how productive he is and give him some candy. That's the way that Bush is. I mean he has made a mess domestically and internationally, but right when he would be punished (right when Dean was becoming popular) they find Saddam. It's very strange. I think that they knew where Saddamn was for at least a month. The only reason they didn't capture him before is that he was their trump card. Right when reelection became a hot topic and Dean became popular, Bamm! They played the trump card and Bush is back on the top of the polls. Not many americans know what is actually happening overseas many don't even know what Saddam has done wrong or where their troops are fighting.  Hmm.... My opinion is that I hate and admire the Bush adminstration for their sneakiness, and that the Democrats have no chance of winning. In fact they have negative chances, they owe chances to win to Bush. BURN THE BUSH!!
