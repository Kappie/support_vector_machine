Speaking of games, Cody wanted my Harvest Moon 64 (cuz it's really rare and hard to find) so I told him he could have mine if he bought me DBZ:Budokai 2.  Which he did.  Good trade in my mind.  I somehow got control of the t.v. for a while and just played that for hours.  Beat it twice already.  It's better than the first, but really weird and fustrating.  (I will fuse Goku and Vegeta... damn you Buu...)  Other than that though, nothing's going on.  I saw Spiderman 2 today.  Better than the first.  Doc Oc was cool.  I could be watching the fireworks that everyone on my block is shooting off right now, but meh.  I don't wanna get chewed up.  Listening to them is just as fun.  Ok, so until something exciting happens (like me getting my contacts), I'll be off. later dayz
