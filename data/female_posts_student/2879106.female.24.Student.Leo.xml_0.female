I am not sure which road I want to go down, but there is one thing for sure, I am at a crossroads and I have to choose a path. I am so confused and scared but I guess that's what life is all about. Why is it so hard to let go when you know that it is probably the right thing to do. Sorry about being so vague, but this is all I can say for now. I can say this though, "St. Jerome said something along the lines that a friend who leaves probably wasn't ever your friend to begin with." This isn't a direct quote but I think you get the idea. Thanks to everyone who has been there for me when I needed you. My only hope is that I can do the same for you.
