Everytime it occurs to me that we are actually into July now, I am amazed. It sure doesn't feel like July!  Nothing says summer quite like berries [even if you are wearing a parka while enjoying them]. While many people will no doubt be scrambling to Super-Valu tomorrow to grab containers of fresh strawberries at 1.99/qt, I have to admit that I'm not all that crazy about them - the strawberries, not the people. My heart belongs to blueberries and blackberries, both of which, I think, have much more flavor.   The blackberries have come and gone. Their appearance tempting and all too brief. Despite the fact that I am relatively poor - full-time university student ... single mother of two ... no child support [you get the picture] - I broke down and bought a precious half-pint for 3.99. The smart thing would have been to make them into a dessert with a multitude of other cheap ingredients to lower the cost and provide a treat for everyone, but in a moment of selfish abandon, I ate them as they were, straight from the container, slowly, savoring every delectable, juicy morsel. I was in heaven until my daughter said to me - 'In the movie, The Good Girl, someone died from eating blackberries.' My enjoyment waned. That was my punishment for being greedy.  I've been more generous with the blueberries. They are cheaper than blackberries, yet still more expensive than strawberries. I find them more versatile though, so I don't mind paying a bit extra ... pancakes, scones, muffins, buckle, cobbler, tarts, slump ... the possibilities are delicious and endless. At this very moment, I have a quart of the little blue treasures tucked away in my crisper waiting to be transformed into a yummy, heartwarming dessert.  As for those strawberries, I'm sure I will be among the shoppers picking up a container or two, because what is summer without at least one serving of strawberry shortcake? Even if you are wearing a parka while eating it!
