I've been inspired by the folks at  urlLink caliblog  to make me a movie - I was also inspired by the great deal I can get on a camera! Yeehah - I love buy now pay later - means I can get whatever I want NOW!! Anyway I've been inspired and I'm looking forward to playing movie maker while I;m on holidays - even if I just get to tape me and my friends being dorks I'm happy! I'm going to visit my grandparents and uncle and aunty on sunday probably til tuesday or wednesday - it should be a nice relaxing time I'm looking forward to at least a little holiday on my holidays - cos thats probably all I'll get with all my moviemaking! Haha Unfortunately I don't really have anything super super exciting to report so I'll make it short... Have a nice day
