I don't get you anymore,  Are you crazy !?    Because right now this is no way of going about getting me to have some kind of  feelings   for you  anymore.    I was  seriously thinking  you know, maybe just  maybe things could work , but  you blew it  all, and you know what, i'm  not  going to  let myself  be set up, just so that  you  can  drag me down , again!   This is it,  never again.    I'm  gone.
