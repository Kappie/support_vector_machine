A date-rape drug on the market called "Beer" is used by many females to target unsuspecting men.  The drug is generally found in liquid form and is now available almost anywhere. It comes in bottles, cans, from taps and in large "kegs."    Beer is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their male victims to go home with them and have sex.  Statistically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of Beer and then simply ask him home for no strings attached sex.  Men are rendered helpless against this approach. After several Beers, men have reportedly succumbed to perform sexual acts on horrific looking women to whom they would never normally be attracted.  After drinking Beer men often awaken with only hazy memories of exactly what happened to them the night before, often with just a vague feeling that "something bad" occurred.  At other times these unfortunate men are swindled out of their life's savings, in a familiar scam known as "a relationship."  It has been reported that in extreme cases, the female may even be shrewd enough to entrap the unsuspecting male into a longer-term form of servitude and punishment referred to as "marriage."    Apparently, men are much more susceptible to this scam after Beer is administered and sex is offered by the predatory females.   Forward this warning to every male you know.  If you fall victim to this insidious Beer and the predatory women administering it, there are male support groups with venues in every town where you can discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner with similarly affected, like-minded guys.  For the support group nearest you, just look up  "Golf Courses" in the Yellow Pages.
