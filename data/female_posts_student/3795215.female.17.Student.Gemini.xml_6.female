Mirage  Never-ending starlight eternal glistening bliss Blue dusk of moonlight During the day I miss the calm serenity of night the mysterious quality of the dark The sweet lucious absence of light brings us to the journey on which we'll embark. Your loving nature brings me close I gently grab your hand You- the one whom I care for most- are taking me through forbidden land. One touch leads to a hug, which in turn leads to a kiss This moment I hope will never end My heart jumps as we enter the abyss Things move slowly and tenderly we blend My first experience with such lust -the epitomy of your heart- I turn to tell you- I feel I must- that I love you and hope we'll never part but as I turn to face you, your image disappears Frightened I blink and as I do so- lights all of our surroundings, too, disappear all but one thing- light I search for your face- your body But no one is there I seach for all familiarity but all I find is air. Awonken and shaken I begin to relalize the romantic evening never existed the face, body, emotion and deep eyes normally something not easily dismissed merely a dream hidden behind a romantic disguise, Such a pity- you were merely a          Mirage.
