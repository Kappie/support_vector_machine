Its a golf tournament that raises money for foundations, but you only get a spot to play with a pro if you, either: Have mucho denero to by yourself a spot, or, you get offered a spot by a sponsor. Marge got offered a spot by the company that was the main sponsor: covenant Health Care...She just so happens to work for them, so she had an easy chance! So she was 1 of only 5 women playing, she was in a group 5 people, 4 women, and the pro-- Pat Moore.  This Guy was apparently a pro...But I had never heard of him! There were pros there that I had heard of before though! Dave Roesch...He's from Menomonee Falls, and he had the lead at the US open this year for a round (then lost it!). So we saw him, and I saw another famous person (not a pro, but still cool), Terry Porter, the Coach of the Milwaukee Bucks! I also met the UW golf coach, Jim Shuman. We talked for a while about my scores, and about the Edgewood team, and he even said that I could come and visit him at University Ridge for a lesson...I was for it! I thought it was cool, we were the only spectators there! So I think I got a present for going! A free lesson from a great pro! Hell yeah! Well needless to say I already get good lessons from a PGA pro, Dave the Wedgie!   After the rain filled day, and seeing some famous people,we headed on home so the bro and sis could get to their baseball/Softball games. That was an interesting ride home! But somehow my dad fixed my brakes! We drove my car, and they used to be jerky brakes and I hopped in the car to go to my softball game...and they never jerked once on the way there! I was pleasantly surprised!   So my Softball game today was really fun! Hot..Humid..Mosquitoes...Couldn't ask for a greater night! haha...Well we played really well, and I had a pretty good game! No errors, and was 2x4! I didn't strike out like last week! Thank god! And I definitely flirted it up with the hotter older men! wink! hehehe. Can't help the fact that they do it first! And they play next to me...Or in front of me! (get my drift!?)...Todd! WOW anyway...We won 10-2, and we definitely need to beat them! I had 4 put outs, and had tons of balls hit towards me, but they either were foul, or caught by Todd in front of me at 3rd! So hey, cant complain about that one!   I'm going to be gone for the next 4 days, relaxin' in the Dells. Not the stereotypical dells, but the nicer end-Northern Dells, in the Forest! But we have big plans to hit up Noah's Ark, and Big chief to get some Go-Kart Action too!! It shall be fun! Ahh...This resort is beautiful! Its deep in the woods and on the Wisconsin river. So late at night you look out the window and you see riverboats paddling done the river with all their lights on! Its soo pretty! So I'll be back on Sunday with the results of my awesome trip up north!   Goodnight All!
