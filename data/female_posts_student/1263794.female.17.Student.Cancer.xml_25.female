Aproximently 9:30 while doing my APUSH hw I realized that I was not physically or mentally capable of doing anymore work whatsoever. Now I'm aware that this would not be considered a breakdown, but with the companionship of the screams  that seemed to roll off my tounge (sorry dad, wrong place wrong time) and the sudden urge to burst into tears I figured I could well consider this my first official breakdown of the year. I have a strange feeling there are many more to come......I can't do this folks. I want last year back.
