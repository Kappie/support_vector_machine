Well, I'm cheerful enough to stop thinking about negative thoughts. It started the day with a wet rainy morning. I just couldn't fall asleep. I kept waking up in between my dreams...oh dear. I woke up and of course cleaned up, ate breakfast and dashed off to school. I can't be late! But it was raining...and the car was travelling in such a slow speed. I finally reached there. But I'm late. Sigh. I want the bubble gum!!!  Then we fall in at 7.45 sharp. Did a little tiny bit of drills but it's enough for me. Set up the instrument and headedfor sectionals. But after about half an hour, we went back, because the tutor was not able to be here. So we went back and then we sat down at the trombone's seat. It's extremely bizarre to be sitting way behind from the front sit, but comfortable enough. We played and I noticed the good thing about sitting behind is that we can do things without the conductor or other people noticing. Ha.  I exchanged instrument with Peggy because Jaslyn suspect I AM THE ONE who is producing the airy sound. But hey! It's not me, all right!? I may be airy sometimes but not that airy. IT IS REGINA who is the culprit! Seeing her just makes me faint. The band needs more potential player even like shiqi but none of us will be sad to see her go, that's the truth. She's been sticking out during the blending in tuning and she can't read notes, dynamics, rhythm. I AM LOSING MY PATIENCE! OK, I admit I'm once like that but I can't imagine myself smiling infront of huiling or kokting when I can't play the notes! I can't really be fierce because the atmosphere won't be either. Gee. I'm really wondering how I'm going to survive like that. Regina is a hopeless case and Yina is slacking away! What kind of juniors are that? Last time, we don't dare to voice to things because seniors are fierce. But now, they're taking the chance to slack!    We're being reprimanded by the conductor because of our gleeful look, our heck care faces, mainly because of our attitude. Our band's fame had been completely being thrown away and we had the notorious reputation of being the cca nobody wanted to join (except those who come from musical backgrounds). This problem had been going on for a long time and it was being focused even harder than usual lately because the sec4s had left! We cannot even play the national anthem properly! The marches don't even sound firm! I've got a feeling that if we exclude the sec1s, we can play even better. There are players with potential in the sec1s but not all. But then again, we didn't have enough players. We can play better! We  can  do it! C'mon! But is everybody willing to strive for the best!?  No!  Surely there's someone who did not want to practise and didn't want to come for band at all! Gee. How I hope this band will be filled with people who want to play! But it's impossible...    Just when I am about to practise as hard as I can for this weekend, now, my instrument was sent for repair! GEE! I'm just about to be hardworking and now they're taking my instrument away! I guess that's how life is. It's great that now someone can send it for repair because this clarinet had not been working for ages. Furthermore, it's  new !! It's hardly a year old! And if those rusty clarinets can work and function properly, why can't this newer one be the same!? *groans*. But then again, when I don't have the instrument, I can teach the sec1s more accurately than usual. But I'm surely going to miss the clarinet. Sigh.    After keeping my instrument and giving the clarinet to the quartermaster, I hurried downstairs to fall in. Who knows there's going to be drills again!? It seems like Peggy is in a  very  good mood today. We had a mini competition to compete among the levels. It seems that we're the winner if I'm not wrong, but Peggyhad cleanforgotten about it. Sigh.    Then Mr Ong came down. We compete again. And we had the most solid bang without a timer!  *grins*!  That's our proudest achievement ever. Then later accompany both of them to lot 1 and then went to buy long john silver myself and headed home.     What a great day!  =) (Well, it's satisfactory for me!)
