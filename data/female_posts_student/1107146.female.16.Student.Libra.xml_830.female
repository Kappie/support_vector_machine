However everytime I start down to do something I remember how I was told to do it.  Whenever my mother speaks to me she uses a tone which I can best describe as the same tone one would use to a muddy dog whom just tracked mud throughout the entire house, including the vacuumed carpets and mopped floors.   How my mother even knows about these tones is unclear seeing as she never vacuums or mops.  And when I say every time I mean every time, such as "Good job, Will on your 99th percentile on (insert standardized test here)" and "Do you want to help me with scouts tonight" and who could forget "Fix [this computer that isn't working because I decided to try to play every game that I could find online and tried to get at least six trojans to detonate in less than ten minutes and no one but me has been on in at least two weeks so I am the only one who could have possibly caused these problems] NOW!!!" So after responding in kind I get screamed at for "yelling when I have not been yelled at" and "Never showing her any respect."  Would someone please tell me when it was that people felt that just on the fact that they have wasted more years of their life they deserve respect.  I have notice that lots of the people I have dealt with this year don't believe that respect is earned, but given to all "superiors" (people whom have less time left here because they spent it jacking off). So every time I start something productive that my mom told me to do, I grate at it continously.  How this is supposed to get me to do anything well.  It really does hurt my grades, think everytime I start to actually do homework or study or read or anything I just remember her screaming that I'm a spoiled shithead not worthy to kiss her feet and that my total worth is less than that damn non-existant dog that tracks mud on floors in other people's house.  What the fuck is her rational behind this god damn tone.  Well at least this has one up side, I won't have much trouble adjusting to college life, seeing as it can only be better than this hell. thanks Mom, really I'm grateful for you making my life one big living hell.
