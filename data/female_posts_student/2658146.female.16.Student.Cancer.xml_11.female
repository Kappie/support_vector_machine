Mum's birthday was Saturday, but she didn't come into town until yesterday. I hate my mum...  I had to help mum pack her stuff yesterday. "Lift with your legs, not with your arms." Well now my legs feel like they'll give way any second. Right thigh and left calf, both sore as heck. Stuff hates me like that.   Current Mood:  Indescribable
