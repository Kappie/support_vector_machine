You all and your sitting at a desk and "oh, I didn't know the square root multipliedblablabla". You call talking and thinking and going for lunch "hard"?! BAH.

About that cool suprise I was supposed to do Sunday night, well it's happening friday night, at the all-niter. Be there or be squ...really regretful. Yes, squreally regretful.   All of you who are bored...Yes, you are bored. DON'T ARGUE WITH THE PREACHER.
