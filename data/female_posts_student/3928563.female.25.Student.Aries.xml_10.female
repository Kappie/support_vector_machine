I am currently dealing with someone who's pretty uninterested in condoms because they feel tight and don't allow for any feeling/sensation during penetration. He keeps insisting that he has "really good control" and will not cum while fucking. This might just become a regular little exchange that we go through because I remain convinced that condoms are better for me and he remains convinced that no condoms are better for him.  I guess I should go visit the pharmacy and see what the selection is like because I'm sure it is vast, but it seems like you have a good idea of what's out there, so any suggestions for a lady in distress?   ---------------------   You're using  the withdrawal method of having sex, which is where you have sex without a condom and the guy pulls out of the vagina before he comes, coming instead onto whatever's handy (your stomach, face, a kleenex, whatever). The withdrawal method is favored by 13-year-olds and fundamentalist Christians. Do you want to be using anything these two groups endorse?  One of the major downsides of withdrawal is a very high risk of accidental pregnancy. I'm assuming you aren't using another method of birth control, here. Well, you should be. Even if your guy has "really good control," and would never ever get so carried away making love to your beautiful bod that he would forget to pull out just once, he can't stop precum. Precum is basically what it sounds like: a bit of come that helps lubricate the penis during sex BEFORE the guy has an orgasm. It's involuntary, it emerges from his urethra (pisshole) as soon as he gets hard, and there are plenty of little sperm swimming around in it. Some guys have lots of it (no, you're not a freak if your cock starts drooling as soon as you get hard), some guys not so much. But it's there, and it's fertile, and it's bad news for the ladies.   Second of all, guys who refuse to use condoms are at pretty high risk for sexually transmitted infections. Precum, for example, is a great way to transmit infection. And you know, if he's not considerate enough to use a condom with you, is he REALLY going to be so considerate as to tell you about that little bout with Hepatitis B he had awhile back? If you have sex with one of these gems, you're placing yourself at risk. I suggest getting a full battery of STI tests right away.  So, what to do with a guy that refuses to use condoms? My first impulse is to tell you to kick him out of bed and lock the door behind him. But sometimes the spirit is willing and the flesh is weak, so here are some other ideas (and if anyone else has ideas on making condom use better, post a comment below!):  1)  Forget  what everyone tells you about condom sizes being a load of horse crap. I mean, if condoms really were THAT stretchy, they'd be the size of a thimble when they came out of the package, right? I have seen a wide variety of penises with my own eyes, and they DO vary in size. Quite a bit. If your man is significantly larger than average, try using a  larger size condom . They really are better for the bigger man.   2) Remember how you pinch a half-inch at the tip of the condom while you're rolling it on, to leave room for the guy's load? Try putting  a drop or two of lube in the tip . It helps increase sensation for some boyos. Don't slop the lube on, or else the condom might slip right off into your vagina. And what good would it do there?  3) Your guy may have some other issues with condoms that he's masking by saying they're uncomfortable. I've known quite a few guys to, uhm,  deflate  when the rubber goes on. If your guy's not comfortable with you seeing him go soft, he may refuse point-blank to consider condoms. The time-honoured solution is to make putting it on part of foreplay. Roll it down over his cock with your teeth (but don't rip it!). Tickle his balls and do that thing that drives him crazy with his nipples while he's putting it on. He can also practice masturbating solo with a condom to get into practice and get used to the feel.  4) Remind him that  reduced sensation means he can fuck for longer .  5) You could try using the  Reality Condom  for women. This may be a good option for you, because it seems like your partner's not into negotiation. This is a female-controlled barrier method, made of polyurethane, that looks kind of like a really big condom with a small, flexible plastic ring at the closed tip and a bigger one at the open base. Basically, you put the smaller ring (at the tip) as far into your vagina as possible while leaving the bigger one kind of hanging out, making sure it completely covers around the opening to your vag. Then your partner fucks into the condom/your vagina. Remember to put the lube on the INSIDE of this condom. You can also remove the inner ring and use the condom for anal sex.  Upsides of the Reality condom: it's female-controlled, not tight at all, and not latex so people with latex allergies can use it. Downsides: anecdotally, it seems more prone to breakage than regular condoms, it's expensive, and some people complain it's kind of like fucking a grocery bag. In your case, reader, I really think it's worth a try.   I also think it's worth a look at why your guy is resisting condom use so strenuously. Ok, so sex educators are a little off the mark when they insist having sex with a condom is EVERY BIT AS GOOD as sex without. You know what? It's not. Condoms do reduce sensation. Cocks really prefer skinnydipping to wearing a bathing suit.   But sex is STILL pretty fucking amazing with condoms, and using them is sooo much better than waking up infertile from chlamydia, or having your liver destroyed by hepatitis B, or going through that annoying abdominal bloat that accompanies pregnancy. Considering women are more at risk for contracting STI's, that many STI's have more serious health effects for women than men, and that, of course, you'd be the one stuck with the birth or the abortion if you got pregnant, why would you stick with a guy who's willing to expose you to that?
