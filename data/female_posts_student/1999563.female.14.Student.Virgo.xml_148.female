I love history like this, not washington state history.  I love history from the 1800+ Its awesome. I want to be a history teacher. I would love that. I would bea  fun teacher. We would play history games and I could hand out candy.  I would also love to be a  teacher because you are so close to all these childrens lives. You can even change there hwole lives. I want to give every single child an oppurtunuity to be SMART and have many friends. I hate when people are all alone.  I think the only reason there is bullys in school violence and such is beacause first they are all alone. The "popular crowd" starts making fun of them. What do you think when someone makes fun fo you? if you are like me you get angry. Very angry. So these kids let out there anger on people.  If we could just be kind to everyone we could bring a stop to school violence.  It could happen. Think of Columbine, so many lives could have been saved if people would have been friend to the killers..   *sigh*  What a world....what a world.  Do people just not realize what that the thigns they do and say have such a great affect on a persons intire life?
