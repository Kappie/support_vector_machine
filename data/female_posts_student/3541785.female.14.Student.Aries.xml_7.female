Well,all because of this infection that i have fever and swollen throat.Much worse than a usual sore throat. This time i felt really cold!! Bad fever indeed.But i have to go to school no matter what tml. Life is so NOT great. But we have to appreciate the life we have now. Treasure it.. Here that boys and girls?
