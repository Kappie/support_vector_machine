I feel drained without having done anything of major importance, I'd planned to meet up with an old friend of mine but forgot totally to call her up and confirm. I remembered at like 1 am yesterday and by then it was too late. Oh well.   Today was weird, my dads away so we got to sleep in way later than usual, the place was a mess and I came down at about 12ish and found my mum and sisters watching TV. My mum surprises me sometimes. Afterwards I guess she reckoned we'd had too much of a lax system and set us all chores.   My mum went out today to visit a guy whose in hospital's mum. The guy got pretty beat up and is now in a coma. I just found out today that he's my friend's fiancé. I felt so bad, I mean I knew there was a guy in hospital in a bad condition but I didn't know who it was and I guess I didn't care a lot. Apparently am pretty heartless now or so I’ve been told. Oh well, who cares, right? When I used to care about everything, it only led me to being hurt and accepting it for ‘mercy's sake’.   Moving on, I’m going to Email Prof. Tariq Ramadan sometime, I doubt he'll reply, but I made some points to ask but didn't get a chance to during the conference on Monday.   Talking of conferences, I think I should try and go to more. I ended up learning a lot, and although beforehand Id thought they would be boring (Secretly) they actually weren't. Well, apart from the talks from people sponsoring. Like I think they were meant to be refreshers or short breaks, but I was thinking 'Please get offstage already'. Uuuugh.   With Monday's one, after I heard Sh. Qaradawi and Prof. Tariq Ramadan, I wasn’t really interested anymore, because that's who I went for. That sounds bad but whatever.   I want to go JIMAS now, but my mum was like 'I'm not leaving you to go all the way to Leicester by yourself, besides you need a Mahrem'. My only Mahrems are my dad and two brothers. I hardly see my dad because he's either out working or in the house (working). My older bro wouldn't agree to go to JIMAS because Sh. Hamza Yusuf is there and he's been brainwashed to think Sh. Hamza Yusuf isn't good enough or something.   My other brother hasn't talked to me for like a month now. So bye JIMAS. I can't go. Oh well.   I saw like 20 minutes of Kill Bill today, hence the title..its from the song at the beginning:   Bang Bang, He shot me down  Bang Bang, I hit the ground  Bang Bang, that awful sound  Bang Bang, My baby shot me down   I don't think Ill watch anymore. I'm not into violent movies.   Oh I was just having a txt conversation with Hum, there you go, I mentioned you.   Fi amani allah wasalam.
