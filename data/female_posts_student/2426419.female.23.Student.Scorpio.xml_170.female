Thank you, ketchup, for being on my soyburger on this midnight in March. You are so creamy and you make my food taste really special, even more so when you are mixed with a little Miracle Whip.   See, now you want to say thank you to a food that has made you happy. Go ahead. "'Tis sort of better to give than to receive."  Oh yes, and thank you soy products of every and all kind. May God bless those who toil on soy farms.
