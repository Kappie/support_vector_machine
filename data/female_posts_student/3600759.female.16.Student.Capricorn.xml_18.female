So that would be the only reason i wouldn't want the park to close. 'Cause I really want to learn them so i can finally start working deep shifts!  RAIN RAIN GO AWAY COME AGAIN SOME OTHER DAY, RAIN RAIN GO AWAY COME AGAIN SOME OTHER DAY, RAIN RAIN GO AWAY COME AGAIN SOME OTHER DAY!!  The rain is sooooo boring, and just blah, it makes you tired, and blah and want to stay in your PJ's all day and watch TV. Oh well, maybe it'll stop!!  ~~Mel~~
