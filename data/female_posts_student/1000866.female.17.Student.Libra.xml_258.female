Unless, I can come online, but...I doubt I'll really have the time to. I seriously just can't wait to go swim in the lake, and go on the boat, and just lie in the sand and read. Mmmmmm. I'm so so excited.   I've been thinking about a lot of stuff lately. Like, Joanne leaving in August and stuff. I'm just, really really going to miss her. She's one of the very few people I feel I can trust. I don't know why, but I really feel comfortable telling her important things. I don't think she'd tell anyone. I think she thinks so too about me. I mean, we don't really see each other as often as I'd like, but...when we do talk, it's really awesome because we can tell each other stuff. I still need to think of something to get her for when she goes away. It has to be small so she can bring it, but something useful...or, just, something really good. Ahhh! I need to think of something. I also need to think of something to get my mother for her birthday. Man, I suck at thinking of gifts for people.  Hmmmm, I wonder if my other load of laundry is done yet. Probably not. Probably I'm just wishing it's done. Probably I'm just a big loser. Probably I should stop saying, "probably."  I'm taking to Alex about my slight problem. I don't know what to do. I mean...he pulled me onto his lap, well, not Alex, haha, but this other guy. No guy has ever done that before. It's just weird, and I don't know what to think. I don't know if I should try going out with him. He is really funny, and nice, but...he does some stuff I don't like, and I guess....I don't know. I really don't. Trouble is, I really like being liked. Being liked just feels really really great. *Sigh* Ah well.    I wonder what the meaning of life is. I was just contemplating that question. I think that there isn't a meaning to life in general, but a meaning to each person's life. Like, there's a meaning to my life, and a meaning to the life of the person sitting across from me. Heh, you know what's incredibly mind-boggling though? Thinking of infinity. Or...black holes. It's just...wow. See what happens to my mind late at night? I get weird...strange...psycho...................  And then I start using dots. Heh, funny point Alex just brought up in our conversation. "Funny how everyone knows more than me." Heh. So true, in certain situations it's funny how you should know something, and yet, everyone around you knows first. It's just...ridiculous. And, gosh I wish I knew what people thought of me honestly. Like, it'd be nice to know who's worth really trying to be friends with. OK....'nother load of laundry to go put in...whoooo....
