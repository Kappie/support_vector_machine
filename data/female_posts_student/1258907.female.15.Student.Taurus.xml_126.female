When I need you most, your gone I believe That I was decieved And that you can relieve Me of this fear inside  Ive been pulled down Finally Your voice Echoing in my head So I sit, on the floor I cant wait anymore for you  It cant be over now Ill find a way, somehow Im losing me And I cant feel, Anything real Anymore
