(even though i was an avid Owl magazine reader.) and i wonder how much more interested i would have been if science was promoted through photos like  urlLink these   rather than through the rampant use of cheesy LED style fonts in all of my "science probe" textbooks.     for sure, my sister's thing with star trek (so often mocked on my friend  urlLink will 's blog) didn't help.
