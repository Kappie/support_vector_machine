Who knows, something may happen before then. But mostly, I've been watching them alot and thinking about it alot and I think the only reason they are still together is me and my sister. I think so. I hate that. That makes me so sad. But maybe it will get better after we leave...we are usually the object of the argument so maybe...Who knows.  I'm going to school tomorrow after staying home three days it's going to be weird, I won't feel like getting up I know. I wouldn't go but I'm going to Farmville with Tara after school. And I'd like to say goodbye to a few folks I guess, since I didn't Monday. I'll turn in my Latin textbook, too. Oh yeah, and beg to turn in my college form late. If they turn me away I'm planning to plead about needing this because I need as much financial aid that I can get...they don't want to shatter my dreams of going to college, do they?  I hope tomorrow goes well with Tara. I'm so nervous. Haha. I'm not big on just "hanging out" with people. I'm no good at making conversation or anything like that. I can either make really light conversation that takes about a minute and a half of time or really deep intellectual conversation. There is no inbetween.   Read  Whale Talk  by Chris Crutcher. It's the best book I've read in ages. I'm already planning to read it again this summer.     Music: End of Time - Danzig
