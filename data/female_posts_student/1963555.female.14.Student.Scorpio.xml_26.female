Yeah, your part of it! and how they played Piebald.... well the song was called American Hearts and I figured what the hell here's the lyrics.....  Piebald-American Hearts  Hey, you're part of it. Yeah, you're part of it. I walk the streets of a Carolina watching people pushing shopping carts. And there's a guy above me and he's washing windows. Making ten bucks a pop. And he says to me... And I say, "Sir, well have you heard that this country is unequal still? History continues itself. And I did not create the rules. " From all I've heard and all I've seen, this place has broken my American heart.
