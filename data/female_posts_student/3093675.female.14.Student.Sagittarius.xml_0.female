Jeez, it’s only my first day working here and already I hate it. It’s so trés trés chic, it makes me want to puke. I keep thinking over and over, if only dad hadn’t left, I wouldn’t be serving overpriced cappuccinos and espressos to business people and rich little brats who act as if I’m lucky to be graced by their presence.  Yes, my dad, “the most wonderful-est, coolest, kindest, caring-est daddy in the whole wide WORLD!!!”- NOT! What kind of father just leaves his wife and 2 teenage kids, no note, no nothing? A no-good bastard of a father, that’s what kind.  The funny thing is, I never cried, not once. I’m not the kind of person that cries a lot- and he wasn’t really worth any tears, to tell you the truth. Besides, if I cried, the whole world would probably be thrown into a frenzied panic- “Dear Lord!! Syd Wolfmann is crying!! The apocalypse draws near!! It’s the end of all things to come!!” It’s as if me crying is equivalent to the Four Horsemen just a-galloping in out of nowhere to announce that they’ve met their deadline, you know?  So I didn’t cry- I mean, every time he was drunk, he kicked the crap out of my 13-year-old brother and me, if anything, I should be celebrating.  The only problem is, that my mom was completely oblivious to that- she thought he was a fine, upstanding citizen. So naturally, she was devastated when he left. And then there’s the slight issue of finances, which, of course, is my reason for getting this second job at a fancy French café that’s half an hour away from my house in Hartford, near Kenelly School.  After 3 hours of face after snobby face, I was finally done with work for the day. I ran out to my car- which was actually the van belonging to my band, Asylum Street- and was surprised to see our drummer, Jade, waiting impatiently.  “FINALLY!! Come on, we gotta go to Sarah’s house!” she exclaimed.  “Jeez, I’m fine, how are you?” I replied sarcastically.  “Syd, I’m serious!! We have something really important to tell you!” she screeched.  “Alright, alright!!! And doctors say there’s no known cause for an aneurysm?” I mumbled in response.   The half hour drive back to the neighborhood that we all lived in seemed excruciatingly long- normally, Jade can’t keep a secret, but so far she hadn’t uttered a word about what the band had to tell me.  We finally reached Sarah’s house, a small yellow house on Yale Street. We ran down the stairs to the basement to see Sarah, lead guitarist, and Ashes- short for Ashley- our rhythm guitarist.  “Ok, so what is sooooo important that you had to drag me here straight from my first day at Le Café what’s-its-name, which, by the way SUCKED???” I inquired. “Well, remember when we sent that demo to SubCity Records a few months back?” began Ashes. I nodded, praying that they’d say what I thought they’d say. “Well…. WE GOT SIGNED!!” finished Sarah.  After 15 minutes or so of jumping around like the moron I am, I decided to walk home- it was only 3 streets away, on Exeter St. During the 5 minute walk, I started to think about what this could mean. SubCity wanted us to start touring the next summer, a short 4 months away. It wasn’t going to be a big tour, just the East Coast, and we’d only be stopping at really small venues, but it was a start. The best part was that we’d be touring with my other best friend’s band, Memento Mori. Both bands sent in demos to Hopeless/SubCity- SubCity is a branch of Hopeless that’s for charity bands, like us- and we both got signed. Ever since both bands started, we always said we’d both go on the same first real tour, now that was really going to happen.  There was only one problem. What about Mom and my brother, Dameon? Dameon would love to come with us. He’s always wanted to see us play shows for more that 15 kids at a time, but Mom doesn’t have a lot of love for our music, and she probably couldn’t pay all the bills- I mean, that’s why I got a second job, to help pay the bills, and if I went on tour, she’d lose all of my income. She would most definitely not want me going, and she would NOT want Dameon to go if I did.  I walked in the door of our house- it was relatively huge, considering the size of some of the surrounding houses. Dameon was sitting cross-legged on the floor, watching Rockzilla on Fuse, and mom was nowhere to be found- either she was working, or she was in her room crying. I glanced up at the clock- still some time for practicing bass before I went to bed. I ran up the stairs, making roughly the same amount of noise as a stampede of water buffalo- it’s a habit I have to make as much noise as possible for the sole purpose of annoying people. I slammed the door to my room and picked up my Mark Hoppus Fender bass from the corner of my room.   The next day I went to my job at the café at 7- I was going to work until noon, then go to my job at Hot Topic, which I’ve had for a year or so.  “Medium Soy Latte, please,” said a voice that seemed oddly familiar. I glanced up to see my best friend and the frontman of Memento Mori, Zack Broderick. “Zack!!” I exclaimed, surprised. “Yeah, thought I’d see how your new job is… is it just me, or do I not exactly seem to fit in here?” he asked, making a big point of looking around at the occupants of the café, all of whom had extremely disapproving looks on their faces- maybe it had something to do with his blue and green Mohawk, misfits shirt and plaid pants. “Yeah, it’s possible man. Listen, my break is in, like, 3 minutes, talk to you then- this little rich girl is gonna have a temper tantrum if you don’t move.” I said quietly, earning a glare from the aforementioned girl.   “So the tour starts this summer man- it’s finally happening,” said Zack.  “Yeah, it’s crazy, man. I never thought we’d get signed this early.”  “Seriously, me too. It’s insane, we’re going to be touring and you’ll be just barely 18. But… what about your mom, Joey said she’s depending on you to make money, and you can’t exactly work when you’re on tour?” he asked, mentioning my cousin, Joey, who played drums for Memento. “Yeah, I haven’t exactly told her yet, but I will… I just have to wait until I’ve saved up some money for her to have while I’m gone.” “Man, you gotta tell her soon- otherwise you’re gonna end up telling her the night before we leave, and she’ll have found out by then.” “I know, I know… I’m working on it, man… I just gotta wait a little longer, if I tell her too early, she’ll find a way to keep me from going.”  Well, even though I promised Zack I’d tell mom, weeks went by, until it was only a month before we started touring. I walked into the house, fresh from another day at Le Café de Torture, to see the house seemingly empty with all the lights off.  “I heard something very interesting today, Sydney.” Came my mother’s voice from the living room. Her voice no longer had the scratchy tone of someone who had been crying for hours on end, the tone that I was so used to. Now it was cold and even, and downright scary. Whenever my father had used that tone with me, I had been scared out of my Doc Martens. But not this time, I was sick of being pushed around by other people.  “What was that?” I responded in an equally cold tone.   “Oh, I think you already know exactly what.” She was going to make this as difficult as possible, wasn’t she?   “Let’s pretend I don’t, shall we?”  “Alright then, yes, let’s.” she agreed. “I heard that you’re planning on leaving on tour with your little friends.”  “Ding ding ding, we have a winner!!” I said in a sarcastically animated voice. “Your prize is $10,000 worth of ‘big whoop’ and a lifetime supply of ‘I don’t care’!!!”  “I forbid it.” She said simply.  “Too late, we’re leaving in less than a month.” I said indifferently.  “I should have known.” She sneered, her voice layered with icy contempt and spite. “I should have known. First you drove your father out, now you yourself are leaving! It was so clear- ever since you started that band of yours—"  she spat out the word ‘band’ as if it left a bad taste in her mouth “- it should have made perfect sense. All those years, I prayed that it was a phase, that you’d grow out of it and become a respectable young lady, but it doesn’t seem to matter, you still managed to become a bass guitar playing little bitch, become a disgrace to this family! How dare you? How dare you leave This Family?! Do you know what I thought when I first found out? Do you?! I thought about how much better off the world would be without you, how much better off I’d be if you were gone! Do you hear me, I wish you would die!”  She continued to scream and rant, but it was all meaningless noise. The last 5 words that registered in my mind kept echoing back to me- “I wish you would die…. I wish you would die…” These are undoubtedly the 5 most powerful words in the world.  I was vaguely aware of stumbling up the stairs and into my room, slamming the door, and sliding down on the floor. My thoughts were a blur. Now I knew what it was like to be Justin Sane, the bass player that swallowed a bottle of cough syrup, or Sid Vicious, who overdosed on heroin on purpose, or the kid at school who put a bullet in his brain. It doesn’t take insanity; it just takes 5 words- “I wish you would die”. I stood up shakily and walked over to the desk where I kept all of my drawing materials, including the knife I used to sharpen my drawing pencils. I picked it up and looked at the blade, smeared with graphite. No matter how many times I cleaned it, that knife was still always covered in smudges and stains of graphite. If the blood loss didn’t kill me, then infection certainly would, this blade was anything but sterile.    I stretched out on the floor, staring up at the ceiling. I started to lift up the knife, but then I heard a noise downstairs. I realized it was Dameon coming home from his friend’s house. I heard him turn on the stereo and then heard Pantera blasting through the speakers.  WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING??????!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  I sat up and threw the knife across the room. Mom was one person. Ashes, Jade, Sarah, Dameon, Zack, everyone else…. They were a lot of people. And the people that I’d make happy, there were only a few of them. The people that would mourn for me- there were just as many, if not more. I couldn’t let them down… and more importantly, I couldn’t let myself down by doing this. I couldn’t let one person’s words kill me, no matter how powerful those words were. It’s that simple.  I picked up a notebook and pen from my nightstand and started writing. If lyric writing had helped me through shit before, how come it couldn’t help me now? I scribbled, crossed out, and scribbled some more, until finally, several hours later, I had something that sounded decent. Then I put my notebook away and went to bed- I had to work and practice with the band the next day, and I needed sleep more now than ever.  The next day, after work, the band came over to practice. We played all our old songs first, taking up about an hour, then I told them I had some new material to show them. “Alright, then lets hear it!” said Jade. “Ok, I just wrote it last night- just bass and lyrics, I started on some guitar, but I needed you guys to help with that, I mean, you’ll be playing it- I didn’t even start on drums.” I played the song I had written the night before for them. When I was done, 6 minutes later, they were staring at me in awe.   “Sydney, I need to talk to you.” Said my mom as I walked up the stairs from my basement, where we’d been rehearsing. I looked over at her, not quite ready to talk to her. “I… I lost my job. They said I was out too often, ever since your father left.” She told me before running to her room and slamming the door, just as I had so many times.  Now I was faced with a new dilemma- if Mom still had her job, she could at least support herself if I took Dameon with me on tour, but now there was no way in hell. I picked up the phone and dialed my aunt- mom’s sister’s- number. I needed help, we needed help. There was no way we could survive without mom working.  “Hello?” said a voice at the other end. “Hey Aunt Katey…” I said. “Syd, what’s wrong?” she asked. “Mom lost her job.” I said flatly. “And I don’t see how I can tour next month if she’s not working, she can’t support herself, even if Dameon comes with me.” “Well, then it’s final. Your mother is coming to stay with me.” She said matter-of-factly.  “Huh? Are you serious?” I asked, suddenly realizing that there was some hope. “Yes, of course. If Dameon wants to go with you, then by all means, but if he doesn’t, he’s welcome to stay as well. “But… I mean, wouldn’t it be imposing…?” “Of course not, you’re my family too! Look, even if you stay, they’ll be out on the streets in a matter of months. If your mother stays here, it gives her some time to get back on her feet without having to worry about the mortgage. Give her some time to cool down, then tell her tomorrow.” She said. “Thanks!! Bye!” I replied.   The next day, we had another practice at my house, to finish writing the song. Jade had come up with a drum solo, and Ashes and Sarah had come up with some guitar.  We spent 2 hours putting everything together, then when we finally got it right, we decided to run through it one more time.  “Suffocation.  Your words force the air from my lungs, Air that now tastes cold and dead As images of days we had Run slowly through my head.” At first the vocals were soft and even, no signs of any screaming. But it slowly got louder and louder through the next few verses, until it was my signature shrieks and howls.  “Suddenly I can breathe again But the air still tastes dead to my lungs Now I can safely say  That my time is done…”  At this point, Jade flew into an angry drum solo, at least a minute long, followed by Sarah’s guitar solo, which started out as angrily as Jade’s drums, but faded into soft, mournful melodies. After the solos, I sang the last lines of the song, in the same tone as the opening lines:  “To those that I love, The ones I leave behind Please do not cry And please don’t try to save me tonight I still love you This is goodbye….” I glanced up, thinking I heard someone running away quickly, but upon seeing no one, I decided it was nothing. Still, I could have sworn I heard something…  We packed up and I went to find Mom and tell her what Aunt Katey said. I found her sitting in the living room. “Mom, you’re gonna stay with Aunt Katey while I’m on tour.” I said flatly. “I suppose Dameon will be going with you?” she asked. Her voice wasn’t the scratchy, crackly tone, but it wasn’t the cold, spiteful one either- she sounded resigned to the fact that I would go no matter what, and Dameon would be going too. “If he wants to. Sorry, but it’s for the best…” I trailed off. “I know.” I walked back downstairs to pack up my bass, thinking “And so it begins…”   From the Asylum Street online tour journal: We’ve been on tour for 2 weeks now- it’s so cool! We’ve been getting on each others nerves occasionally, but it’s no big deal- we’re finally living out our dreams, and it’s the greatest thing- well, ever. Dameon’s having fun, just like everyone else- he may be only 13, but he fits in really well. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from touring- and getting ready for the tour- is that not everything is as simple as we’d like it to be- JUST DEAL WITH IT. Remember to catch us when we’re in town- that is, if you live on the east coast. Check out the Tour Dates for more info.  Love, Peace, Unity, Syd   Hope you liked it. It was fun writing it.
