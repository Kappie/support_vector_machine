The men that are not so handsome, but are nice men with money think we are only after their money!  The handsome men without money are after our money!  The handsome men who are not so nice and somewhat heterosexual, don’t think we are beautiful enough!  The men who think we are beautiful, that are heterosexual, somewhat nice and have money are cowards!  The men who are somewhat handsome, somewhat nice and have some money and thank God are heterosexuals are shy and NEVER MAKE THE FIRST MOVE!   The men who never make the first move, automatically loses interest in us when we make the first move!  Now, who in world can understand men?
