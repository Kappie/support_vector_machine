So I decided that I should start doing that so you can get to know me better.  Since I am such a brilliant person I've decided to instate  a person of the day  section of my blog.     Today's lucky person is going to be my older brother Brian.  My brother and I are 13 years apart.  Yes, I know that is a lot but we get along better than most siblings I think.  In fact their has been several occasions when I wanted my younger brother and Brian to trade places...Brian come back and live at home and Tyler can move out.  Hey why not?  Brian is married to a wonderful woman that I'm proud to call my sister-in-law named Tami.  They were married in Las Vegas during the summer before my 5th grade year.  (I must say Las Vegas is an interesting place but can't really reach it's full fun potential unless you're 21)  Since then, they've had two boys.  My friends, still think that's strange that I'm an aunt but I love it!  Andy was born when I was in the 5th grade and Alex was born a year and a half ago.  Over the summer Brian under went brain surgery.  The hole connecting his spine to his brain was growing shut and needed to be reopened.  After two surgeries and several weeks of rest, Brian is back to normal.  You never really know how much someone means to you until you almost lose them.  I'm very thankful for my older brother.  Although I don't always talk to him everyday, I know he's there.  I love you!  Disclaimer: This doesn't tell everything about my brother.  Honestly there is too much to tell and my fingers get tired from typing a lot.    I have an award to give out on this wonderful day of school cancellation.  No, no, it has nothing to do with school.  This award is given to Hoobastank for having the best band name.  Wow! It is just so much fun to say!  Okay now everybody...HOOBASTANK!  I just love that name.  I've always thought that but have never really come out and said it.  So now I'll say it...they have the coolest name!  I hope the rest of you out there in cyber space have a wonderful snow day and use it to it's full potential!
