Because I have 100000 movies to watch and 1000000 minutes to waste. And I didn't do any of my huge load of homework yesterday, and I didn't do my laundry, and I feel crappy, ...and I feel like watching Aladdin, so this morning I was just like I'M STAYING HOME.  *              *               *  I don't want to think about school so I'm gonna think of things I want to do over Spring Break. Ummm... *mind goes blank*.... well it's Nick's birthday one of those days, don't know what's going on with that yet.... um..... wow that's kinda it. Oo I want to go to the zoo. Who wants to go to the zoo with me??? Haha the last time I went to the zoo was two years ago with my old southern grandpa.... "Nadlie, I want to see th' monkahs". Haha he's awesome. But yeah I want to see the monkeys! It's fun going there when it's all sunny. So yeah... what else... If it gets really nice, me and Charlotte and Erinn should camp out in the backyard! Yeah... wow I'm really bored.
