Paul can't stand me now. And apparently I don't say anything to people about what I think. Blogging is about the only way people know shit from me. They learn bits and pieces, but I'm afraid of letting people know me too well. I want them to know me that well, I just can't let go of myself. I did that once. Unconditionally, even. Unfortunately, it fucked up. Now I don't trust Paul like I should. Sometimes I don't trust him at all. Also, I rarely trust myself.      I give up.       I know everything sucks, yeah. And this is gunna be the last time you'll hear me complain.
