I called her at 7:11 (because her birthday's 7/11) but she was in Chesterfield so I just asked her sister if she could tell her I said Happy Birthday. This is really kind of a relief to me because I don't really like talking on the phone. It makes me nervous.  I was thinking of something someone said to me months and months ago and I finally thought of the perfect thing I should have said. I hate that. But don't worry, it's not like I was stressing over it all that time, it just randomly came into my thoughts and I thought of it. I thought about it alot when it first happened, though.  I've been listening to a lot of old mixes today. Back in the days I used to use Kazaa all the time. I do miss using it, though. At first when I got rid of it it didn't bother me at all but it does now. But I don't think I'd ever download it again because it makes my computer so slow and sickly. And then I'd have to get rid of my anti-spyware/adware program. Blah blah. Lots of work for just problems. I never cared about getting caught for downloading songs, though. I guess that's sad but hey.   Music - Give Me the Pen - Desaparecidos
