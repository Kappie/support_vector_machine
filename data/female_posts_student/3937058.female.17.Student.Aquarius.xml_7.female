Like Ben..."He has 2 eyes to seeee, and 4 feet!" lol, beautiful and obv 'mates' and 'the quest for sir dumbalot' (hope that's right!) rocked 2! Also, afterwards me, Helen, Holly, Stringer, Tom and Rob (nowt to do with Friely) went back to said Friely's abode and hung out heehee. There was much hilarity and seems Martin is now over Lukas and fancies Tom lol...he may try to deny it but we know the truth! Ah, poor Tom, I doubt he returns the love, not even the eyebrows could save him. Anywho, now I am bored again and TOTP sucks, want to see who goes on BB later tho! Gotta be Ahmed, that man is soooo annoying! As I have time to fill might as well tlk randomly...my hamster needs cleaning out, I'm sure u all wanted 2 know that but I am so lazy and can't be bothered to get hamster pee all over me just yet, I'll do it 2moro am, after a long lie in of course. Poor Matt, Amy, Helen, Simon, Becky, Stringer etc etc etc working on a Saturday, though I really need a job but don't think I can actually fit it in poo poo poo. Check u later dudes and dudettes. LAUREN OUT xx
