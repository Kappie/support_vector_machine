There's me thinking I kicked 5 modules ass's and I now have THREE more modules, NOT two, oh well, just have to do them. The paper sheets for this Module 8 has the answers to them which is no help to me, I want to learn without the answers in my face, just have to get my mum to ask me the questions without me looking.   Just got a phone call from o2, saying I can get more out of my phone, I listened, I hardly understand what the woman was saying and it seemed it went on for every. Why don't they listen when you say I am busy { I wasn't really }.   babydragon x
