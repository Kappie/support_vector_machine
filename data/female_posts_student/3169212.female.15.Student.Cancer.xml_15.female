They all turned to her with looks that said, "That's the smartest thing we've heard you say so far, but we have no idea.  This is just how The Creators want this story to go."  "Okay, I get the point, you guys are as clueless as I am," Baka pointed out.  "I don't think we're as stupid as you," Kuwabara commented.  "Oi, Numbskull, who's the one who got a  seven  one a  multiple choice test ?" Baka snapped back.  "Geh!  How do you know about that!?" he shouted at the bitailed demon.  "I'll never tell," she responded in a eerie sing-song voice as she shook her finger slowly like a metronome in front of Kuwabara's square face.  Baka walked on ahead of him.  Kuwabara stuffed his hands in his pockets and with a slouch of his shoulders he mumbled, "Creepy little prick."  "I heard that."  Suddenly a woman with light blue hair and a pink kimono flying on an oar landed in front of the group.  "Yusuke," she said in an annoying British accent.  "Oh, who are you?"  "I'm Baka."  "I'm Hito."  "And we're demons who are presently helping these idiots out," Baka said.  "Speak for yourself," Kuwabara commented under his breath.  "I heard that."  "Gyy!"  "Alright.  Well, anyway, Yusuke, an extremely powerful demon is heading towards Mushiori City.  He's going to kill everyone and devour them."  "Let me guess, Botan, Koenma wants me to kill him off, right?"  "Bingo!" Botan responded cheerily.  ***  They came to a point directly in the demon's path, weapons ready.  Every foot step the demon took, he shook the ground.  The demon was huge, but even that would be an understatement.  They had to tilt their heads all the way back to see the guys face.  All of them attacked at once.  Kurama wielding his signature Rose Whip, Hiei with his katana, Kuwabara with the spirit sword (*cough* lightsaber rip off *cough*), while Yusuke, Baka, and Hito used their projectile attacks.  None of them worked, he swatted them away with a simple motion of his hand.  "You can't defeat me with those pathetic attacks, you fools."  "Gah!  Bad breath!" Baka stated as she covered her sensitive nose.  With his abnormally large hand, the demon swept them all away, sending them into trees.  "Damn!" Hiei spat as he picked himself off the ground.  "Such insanely strong power!  How will we defeat him?" Kuwabara paniced.  "Drama prince.  This calls for my infamous tear-jerking jaw-breaker."  Baka pulled a fist-sized red orb out of thin air.  "What the hell is that?" Hiei asked.  "I just told you.  This is guaranteed to cause instant paralysis to whoever eats it."  She walked up to the large demon, only about the height of the demon's big toe.  "Hey, mister big, powerful demon dude.  Um, I've got something you might want to try," she shouted up to him.  The demon looked down.  "What is it?"  "Just a really tastey piece of human food."  "Fine."   What an idiot.   Baka climbed nimbly up a tree till she was eyelevel with the demon.  She handed him the small orb and he popped it in his mouth.  Almost instantly he froze up.  "Now!" she shouted.  Hiei took this opportunity.  He sliced through the demon like he was soft butter.  The demon disappeared instantly.  After Hiei and Baka had reached the ground, Yusuke asked, "What did you put in those?!"  "Special secret recipe."
