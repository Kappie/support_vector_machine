Birds always grow silent before the night descends Cause nature has a funny way of breaking what does not bend  A hero's torso built of steel and novicane His heart a bitter beat inside a bloodless frame There was a hole inside his soul a manicure could not fill So he found himself a whore to love while daisies choked on the windowsill  We've made houses for hatred It's time we make a place where People's souls may be seen and made safe Be careful with each other these fragile flames Innocence can't be lost it just needs to be maintained  A small town in Ohio, 2 boys are filled with violence As night in the darkness spreads it's legs for hate and ignorance. We are given to a god to put his faith therein But to be forgiven we must first believe in sin.  We've made houses for hatred It's time we make a place where People's souls may be seen and made safe Be careful with each other these fragile flames Innocence can't be lost it just needs to be maintained  Strange current pulling, a sleepless ebb and flow. Me, I drift sideways, and you, I don't know. I want to live bravely and love without fear. I want to always feel the wings of great near. We all will be Christed when we hear ourselves say we are that to which we pray.  We've made houses for hatred It's time we make a place where People's souls may be seen and made safe Be careful with each other these fragile flames Innocence can't be lost it just needs to be maintained.
