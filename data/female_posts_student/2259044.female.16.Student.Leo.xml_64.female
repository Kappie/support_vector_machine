On  December 26th  i basically said "when it's over it's over" then on  january 31st  i basically said i could have had what i wanted, why did i screw things up? then  February 1st  i said i'll stick around even though i should leave THEN on  valentines day  i said i want to be together  february 24, 28, 29  i was all peachy, i was happy about it! by  march 8th  i thot i'd hit "the standstill"  march 13th  i was talking about the right thing not being what i wanted  april 5th  i ended it all  april 6th  i wanted it back  april 17th  i said i knew it was the right thing to end it  April 20th  i was thinking about february 1st!!  i haven't written about that thing since, i was writting about friends, about new guys, about anything and everything BUT that! and now...here i am again...what am i doing? does he realize wut i've done to him, doesn't he see he should forget he ever knew me? but i don't want him to....so, summers comming, i guess i'll see...changedfish
