Chilling in the arcade was fun. They dropped me off and Jen n'the crew picked me up. We hiked and they brought me out to a dam which was awesome. It was very peaceful and I wish I that I had brought a camera with me. I should start doing that anyways. Rils called me which is always pleasant. Luv ya hun. :-D  Otherwise, listening to some of the conversation during the night brought up a lot of painful memories and thoughts. I do not think I have ever felt my heart hurt so badly. I feel very emotionally drained right now. I miss Tycho so much, I have really come to need him for me to even be okay. It is basically inexplicable. Whenever I get to talk to him I just become a happier, all-together more optimistic person. I become more of the person I really wish I was all the time - as opposed to having these down times.  I decided to try to cut out the pain by drinking more caffeine. Got Monster. I tried to drink it very quickly after only having a salad around 12:30 this afternoon and it started affecting me immediately. Like the No Fear from New Hampshire. What happened with the No Fear was that my hands and arms went cold and were shaking. I could not sit still. My heart was also racing a little bit.  Tonight was much worse. My heartbeat was astoundingly, and definitely terrifyingly quick. I could barely breathe. I do not think that I have ever been more scared of something happening to me from an energy drink. Actually, I have never been scared, nevermind terrified. I am not sure if I can give up on caffeine, but I am definitely staying away from it. I layed down and basically had to sleep it off.   No worries though, I am back to normal now. Just very depressed. I am sure that I will get over it quickly. I am looking forward to finally being able to sleep in. Of course I will not though. Just because.   I think I update too much in this. Maybe I do anyways. It is just nice to finally be able to freely divulge information, which has not been poor information really until tonight.   I apologize immensely for the negativity of this post. I assure you that it is strictly temporary. I can never really stay in a negative mood for long. As of the moment thinking of Tycho and Rils is making me smile, so it really is not that bad.   I just needed to get it all out. And I do feel that even after this post that I am still going to desire a small amount of support and/or reassurance. I hate to put a load of any sort, but I am sort of looking to Rils and Tycho for that. I know Marie can help me out, or at least help me to turn it into a joke so that I can handle it better. I need a ride with her I think lol. Rils and Tycho, no one is closer to me than you both. Neither of you could ever believe how important you are to me and how much I appreciate your presence in my life. I do not know what I would do. Marie, you never cease to get me to laugh. Whether I am just having one of those days, or there is a new grave and the day has been going along poorly, I always seem to perk up at lunch with you and Brittany. You can always relate, and can understand me. You and Rils always forgive me when I am being moody and act poorly towards you, and I appreciate that a lot.  I have written all that because I realized today how important it is to let people know that you realize what they do for you, and let them know how much it means to you. I do not want to loose anyone else. Y'all are my life. I could never wish to have better friends, because they do not exist.   Tycho- I really hope that you do trust me in how I feel about you. I could never imagine having the good fortune of being with someone as amazing as you. I am honored to even know you. By being who you are you have taught me so much. lol, it is still hard for me to believe that we are together, just because it was something that I wanted so badly and things never had really worked out the way I wished they would. I am so incredibly happy that this has worked out and I pray that nothing changes it. Thank you for being in my life.  Rils- From just starting to talk in the 8th grade to where we are now has been amazing. Our friendship literally just seemed to grow and grow. I have done some pretty dumb things, but you saw through them and stuck by me. That means so much. Bowling, the Hippodrome, World Civ, ridiculous movies, Spanish, Chemistry, English, lunch, sleeping over, freezing my ass off, just everying. We have had so much fun, and our friendship means so much to me. I am so glad that you know that you can call me anytime and that I will be there to help you. And thank you for helping me.    Marie- the morning rides lol. You catch me at just about every main point in my day and my mood can basically be determined and altered by our talks. In the morning when I am in a poor mood we are usually able to turn it into a joke that we are able to look back at and laugh about. Especially our graves lol. We have this uncanny way of being able to relate to each other, and you always understand me. Thank you for helping me through, and helping me to remember to smile and laugh.  Brittany- who probably does not read this, I am sorry for not really mentioning you much earlier, but you also mean a lot to me. Since 4th grade we have had one of the oddest relationships that friends can have. But that is just the characteristic of it. The point is, that we always end up back as friends. FIRST, student hosts, the dreams, the sleepovers, odd food mixtures, movies, becoming who we are together. Thank you for coming back, listening to me, and showing me a good time.   Well, aren't (stupid conjunctions, I avoid them as much as possible and then I get a situation like that) I being incredibly sappy? Like I said, I realized a good amount of things today. Perhaps I needed it.   I think I have said enough for one difficult evening. And I am feeling better. Please have a good day or night.   -J9
