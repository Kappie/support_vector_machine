I do however intend on keeping my house clean and sticking to a workout schedule from now on...  Thanks to everyone who came to the usual New Year's Eve gathering, it was a blast as usual.  To those of you who missed out, as Bruce would say, "BOOO!"  Thanks especially to my baby who braved a 2 hour drive in the monsoon that was last night's weather with a sore throat and sinus problem just so I would have someone to kiss at midnight.  I really don't deserve you.  All my love always, Dan.
