Combine the two, listen to Harry Potter on audio tape while browsing the  urlLink lipstick librarian , and you're in for a delightful evening.  Mike has reminded me about 12 times today that he gets to paint his theatre on Tuesday. When, you ask? Tuesday! Which Tuesday? This Tuesday!  A couple of days ago, we watched  urlLink Cold Mountain , which is absolutely the most depressing and excruciating movie I have ever seen, including Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan. I liked it quite a bit, but I think I would much more enjoy reading the book. On the other side of motherhood, I find it much harder to watch a dying baby left to freeze to death than I did before. The movie featured many fine actors, all of whom had a wonderful opportunity to die brutally on screen.
