I have been dealing with this pain for the greater portion of the last year and a half and now its finally getting to me to the point where simple tasks are getting difficult to perform, like pressing down the nozzle of a shaving cream can, or opening jars. So today I am going to call my doctor to see if I can get an appointment because I really don’t think I can take this pain anymore. This is especially not good being that my job is centered on using my hands to type and such; I work in a clerical position.   I just called the doctors office and they set me up for an appointment for next Wednesday. I hope they can do something for me. I also asked them to refill my prescription for Lexapro. I don’t think I can survive my life without them right now. I do hate feeling like I need to be on these pills, but I know they are helping and that is the important thing to remember.   I got to talk to Jesse last night on the phone. It was so good to hear his voice, same old’ Jesse. I am also almost finished with his surprise gift. I finished one of them and have one left but he still doesn’t know what it is I am making him. I love this because he keeps on trying to trick me into telling him but I catch his attempts and tell him he will just have to wait to see. All he has figured out is that I am making him something that involves sewing something. But he still has no clue… this is so fun. I should have the finished product out in the mail by sometime next week. Since I have Wednesday off I guess I should plan on mailing it then.   I wish I could see his face when he gets it though… Maybe I can talk him into having someone take his picture when he opens it up… That would be cool.  Any way, I don’t have work tomorrow so my plans are to go see my nephew Jacob’s school ceremony then I am probably going to go home and try to sort though the mess that has become my room. Sometimes when I am stressed cleaning helps me, which is funny because I really dislike cleaning my room.
