JCAHO are these people who come to the hospital every other year and make sure we're doing everything right.  Kinda scary.  We got a 94 though.  All's well there.  Home life, however, is fucked.  My grandma has a abdominal aortic aneurysm.  She'll probably have to have surgery.  Mom and Joe are in Illinois with hier.  Everyday, I feel more and more like an outcast with my roommates.  Nothing I say is funny or is as important as what they say to each other.  Is it because I haven't known them as long as they've known each other?  Am I just that stupid and annoying?  God only knows.    I've been becoming overly stressed about the X-Ray school thing.  Every fucking time I turn around at work, the Junior clinical rotation sheet is right there, staring back at me.  And guess what.  My name isn't fucking on it.  Everyone else's names are, but not mine.  Fuck That.  It pisses me off when people who have no desire, hunger, or passion get the gold, while the truly passionate and sincere ones get fucked and shut out.  Goddamn it.  I'm going to have my own little aneurysm here if I dont chill.  Later.
