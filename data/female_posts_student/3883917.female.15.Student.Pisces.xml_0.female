Well anyway, Thursday I slept most of the day b/c I was up until four in the morning with Lilo, Tay and Amanda and then woke up at seven, Thursday night I went to High Point *claps hands like a retart* ...Friday I hung out with Nick until I had to work, and the interesting stuff starts on Saturday. I woke up around nine, of course I set my alarm because I'm lazy and usually wake up around ten or eleven...but whatever, my dad said we can't wake up that late because we just don't "function right as a family" or whatever, I kinda see what he's saying but come on...I'm fifteen...So anyway, I wander around outside and shit until it's like ten thirty, so then I take a shower (the whole process of clothes hair and makeup takes about an hour and a half) so around eleven thirty I'm done with all that shit and I go and call Nick to see what's up and if we're hanging out. It was Chrissy and Mike's fourteenth birthday so duh I was going to be there before Nick and I had to be at work...so I go to his house and help clean and stuff (for some reason their house is really fun to clean) but before that him and I were in his yard whistling with the grass in our fingers (anyone who's never done that was deprived as a child). So anyway his mom rushes out of the house with the "WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON" look on her face, she's like "What were you guys doing?" And I held up a blade of graass and she's like "Oh, I thought you guys killed a bird or something..." yeah for some reason I found that really funny. So anyway, it's like four now and people start showing up (Mike's band, Chrissy's friends and a bunch of relatives)...at the time Nick and I were upstairs with Chrissy and her friends, sitting in her room (he was shittin around with her new guitar) but once they left we came up with the bright idea of throwing this HUGE inflatable palm tree out her bedroom window (it's three stories high and it faces the backyard, where everyone was) oh MAN that was so funny and then Kathy thought Chrissy did it so she yelled at her, oh man  good times  so anyway now we're on our way to work and we realize that it'sa WEEKEND GAME and we were supposed to be there at three, so we were two hours late...our boss wasn't so pissed but well my parents were, so for some odd reason they drive me back to Nick's for some more of the party, he talked to Haley on the phone (read the first entry, she's 18) or whatever the fuck was going on (I really just don't care anymore) idk his aunt called him up the hill (we were having a "love" moment down by the lake with the sunset) and he's just all happy OH YEAH HALEY'S ON THE PHONE and shit...it seemed like he was nervous about it too, but then when I was talking to his aunt (Haley's mother) while them two were on the phone he kept pulling me closer for God knows what reason, kinda contradicting if you ask me but I really don't care. So later on we cuddle on the couch and stuff and then my mom came, everything seemed okay at first but then she started screaming about me for being late to work and well uhh I had already taken the heat and stuff, she had me to the point where when we pulled into my driveway I was in tears and she thought I was "playing games" with her or whatever, but finally my dad talked with me and everything got fixed. You can never depend on having a talk with my mom without feeling like ripping her head off in the end, nothing EVER gets solved I swear...then yesterday (Sunday if you're a retart) we all went to Water Carnival and had a pretty good time, it made me completely forget about Haley and everything but oh well. It actually didn't hit me again until a minute ago, I don't know why...damn, I'm like gonna break down right now. I don't know why it's bothering me so much, it didn't before...this like came out of nowhere. I'll write more when I get over this...
