They all reported being high and dry but the  urlLink Loblaws  and Extendicare's roofs collapsed, the sewage treatment plant had to release theiruntreated sewageinto the Otonabee (ewww!) and the library, who, during the flood of two years ago decided to move all of their precious artifacts into the basement, collectively slapped their foreheads a la Homer Simpson and said, "D'oh!" Somebody wasn't using their head. The only relative with minor problems was my cousin who had a foot of water in her basement (but unlike many others in the city, it was just water.)     I was thinking of those Magic Eye paintings that were so popular a few years ago. No idea why, especially since I was never able to see them in  urlLink 3-D . Here's the most recent one of the week. Anyone who can tell me what it is will get a proverbial pat on the back.     urlLink     Magic Eye of the Week from magiceye.com urlLink      Poor Martha Stewart. 5 months in ClubFed and a stayuntil she is able to appeal. What is this world coming to?   Back to studying for my Psych test. It seems to be going okay so far but I'm glad I have another 5 days.     More to come...
