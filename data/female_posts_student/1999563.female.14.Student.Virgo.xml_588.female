I studied for over 3 hours for science today and I think I am going to die.  You know how I REALLY wanted to go to the half yearly sale today?? Two people in my family went on two seperate occasions today and no one even told me! I am so mad.  So my mom promised to take me on Friday...which isn't a promise she will probably keep or anything but at least she tries. *rolls eyes*  I am in such a crappy mood, sorry.  I was like "I don't get this science at all." and my brother was like "really? I got perfect on that test and I didn't even have to study! Hah!" So he was just making fun of me because I am stupid so I was like crying and quite sad and I was like "I am not good at anything,Matt is always better than me" and my mom was like "no he isn't!" And I was like tell me one time I was better than him and my mom said "Uh...at least your nice." and I was like Thanks mom, that sure helps.   Grr..  Then my mom was like "Do you even want me to help you study? You are in such a  bad attitude." And i waslike "Well, I don't want to study." and she was like "Fine! Study by yourself."  Okayyy....
