I've edited the prologue for The Marauders Four. It's a much more pleasant introduction than the previous one. Gulp. Still writing, wonders if I'll do a revised version of the Marauders Four after I completed the whole chunk of story. Oh my, that'll be a lot of work to do! But still, I enjoyed reading. I like Darkness Dying by Iniga. Forever Alive by Shaye/Mordred. Confusing matter, I don't know which one to trust.   Godric's Hollow was still in the change of server. Everything went on fine, doing a bit of stuff and homework.
