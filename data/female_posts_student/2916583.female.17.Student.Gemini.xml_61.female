She was shaking for about an hour afterward, and I thought I saw her having an anxiety attack a few times.  I really am not that bad of a driver, it's just been awhile.  I REALLY scared her when I was supposed to turn left outside the Old Centralia exit from school, where I usually turn right on Route 10 to go to my house (actually, my ride goes right lol).  Out of habit, I went into the right lane.  My mom starts screaming at me, and I swerved into the left.  Other than that, I did ok.  Oh yea, there was one other time, when I got distracted goin 50 down Jeff Davis (we were joking about all the "side business" at our town's finest hotels), and I went into the other lane a bit.  Yeah, I suppose I didn't do very good.  I do have seven weeks to improve, though (that's excluding yearbook camp, vacation and a few other dates).  I've ridden with people who have done MUCH worse; one time, I rode with someone (this person graduated, so I suppose it's ok to share it), and I warned the person that there was a stop sign ahead.  It's very hard to see cause it's at the bottom of a hill and has all kinds of shrubs and trees growing around it.  Anyway, the person's about ten feet away when I'm like aren't u gonna stop.  THREE FEET away from the sign, the person slams on breaks, barely missing another car.  Amber scares me too, especially when she pulls away from the school.  Celicas go from 0 to 45 really quickly, and it always takes my breath away for awhile, and my heart stops for a second.  I can't say every teenage driver is bad, cause I've been with some good ones and some terrible adult drivers.  I've never seen an old person drive badly.  Actually, I usually drive fairly slowly for the speed limit, except on the highway - I have a bad habit of checking my mirrors so much that I forget about the speedometer and before I know it the person with me starts shrieking about how I'm going 75 in a 65 area.  Despite all that, my sister still wants me to be her taxi as soon as I get my license.  Some people are just desperate, I suppose. Wow, I'm still a little tired from yesterday.  First, my dogs (two huskies who are about one and a half - they're brother and sister) got out.  I swear that the female, Rascal (that's her name), is Houdini incarnate.  For the gazillionth time, she wriggled out of her chain, and, to make things worse, she's extremely fast.  I'd be willing to bet she could give a grayhound a run for his money.  So the other one, the male, Rocky, is howlin like crazy (he's a huge baby), so I looked out the window to see what was wrong.  I clipped him on a leash so she would come to him, and there's Rascal, chillin in the front yard.  Rocky may be slower, but he's clever.  He ran really fast while I had the rope part of the leash in his hand, burning my hand so I'd drop it.  He ran off with her, so I got the bike.  I rode for about 3/4 of a mile goin everywhere trying to find them, and got Rocky on the most hilly part of the neighborhood.  I then proceeded to walk an additional 2 and 1/4 mile looking for her.  I finally found her after an hour, in the neighbor's yard.  What's worse, I walked another two miles to school to meet the new journalism adviser, and she wasn't even there.  Do NOT get me started on that (not the fact that she wasn't there, the other stuff that happened).   I have to get ready for work now, so I'll end it with this, paraphrased courtesy of News of the Weird (oh man, that reminds me of another thing I wanted to talk about, but I don't have time): this guy served 12 years in prison for burgulary and assault, and as soon as he walks out of jail, he carjacks a lady in the prison parking lot!  Later.
