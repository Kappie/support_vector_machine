I'm trying to be really hyper so I stop thinking about it, but it really isn't working.       I cried yesterday. It was not fun. I'm worried about Erich, and it's something I should be worried about. I wish I was shallow and didn't care about these things. Hurting kinda isn't that great... I was poking myself with a pin (lol) It's the closest I'll get to cutting I guess. If suicide is a cry for help, whats this? A wimper?       It's alright though, I'm just... going to ignore it? No... I can't do that... I'm going to try to understand. Try to see and then maybe I can do more than hurt myself with a safety pin.       .....................      I'm so scared...      Erich...      Terribly sad and need lots of icecream,   Sage
