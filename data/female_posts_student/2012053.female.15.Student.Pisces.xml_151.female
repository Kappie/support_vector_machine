The Floridian’s sunny smile was replaced by a dark and brooding countenance as she picked apart the remnants of her game following the 6-1 6-1 defeat.  The much-anticipated three-set tussle never materialized as Serena exacted revenge for Capriati’s French Open quarter-final win earlier this month in just 45 minutes on Centre Court.  The anticipation had clearly got to Capriati.  “I mean, when everyone’s talking about it so much, it’s very hard to just go out there and just completely focus on tennis,” she sighed. “You know, it’s like I can’t walk around with earplugs in my ears, you know.  “But what can you do? You’ve just got to do your best not to think about it or have that come into play because it does add more tension.  “It’s just very difficult to tune everything out. So, um, just that’s the way it goes sometimes. Not everything is always going to be the way you think it’s going to be.  “So maybe if you wouldn’t talk about it so much, it would have been a better match, I don’t know.  “The rivalry speaks for itself. You don’t have to even talk about it. It’s just there, you know, the people can see it for themselves.   “From the first press conference, from the first match, it’s already talking about the quarter-final match. You shouldn’t. Each match at a time.  “We can drop it now ... we can drop it.”  Capriati was entirely overwhelmed by her opponent and had no answers to Serena’s power and precision.  “She just played too good today ... she kept the level up,” the 28-year-old reflected.  “I would say today is probably one of the best that she’s ever played against me probably.  “I don’t think I really had much of a chance to get into the match and play. I was just feeling so much pressure from her coming off the baseline, the serve.  “Basically that’s what her game plan was -- to tee off on everything, and she was on ... so, really, I just couldn’t even get the rallies going.”
