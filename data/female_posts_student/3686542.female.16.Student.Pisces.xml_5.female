It was a very heart warming ep and it left you knowing that he still cares. :D yey.  I really get involved with my Joan of Arcadia.  Anyho I customised my top today but wearing my blue arm pieces under my black top. it looks cool. so my plan is to buy more 3 quarter length tops and more arm pieces and make cool stuff. :D   on the downside i have to wait til thursday to get my necklace and ring. And we still have no effing hot water. Bloody plumbers. I bathed in water like 2cm full. Then i got snappy cos i couldn't get the conditioner out. We have old pipes. :(  Quote: Friedman on grace kissing Luke. "Did he just convert her from mac to pc?"
