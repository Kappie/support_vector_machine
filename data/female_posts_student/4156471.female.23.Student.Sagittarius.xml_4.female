Because bars sounded more interesting then hiding in her room listening to memories of home she offered to accompany him.  Mistake?  Maybe.  She waited by the Dorm Pubs naming the trees after her friends from home so that she wouldn't be so lonely.  He arrived and he wasn't wearing a kippah.  she asked why and he mumbled soemthing about getting into fights in bars and not wanting to disrespect God.  Bee Rock?  Theystood outsie debating whether to go in.  And then the music reached her. Counting Crows. and in they went.  AT the bar they were offered bugles and olives and cabbage.  He bought the first round.  A german beer with a funny name for him  and Malibu and coke for her.  It was served as a double of rum in a galss and a separate glass of coke with a mixer.  The bar tender engaged them in toothpick games.  Make 4 boxes with these 8 toothpicks. Pinny was a real pleaser.  keeping the bugles filled up and fun coming.  Her companion downed his drink in second. and the girl had taken but a sip.  Her companion tunred moddy and strange.  growing very impatiend and silent.  she felt unconfortable.  She told him she would try to drink quickly.  He told he not to do so... but his action and expression were of the atmost impatience. Finaly they left.  The girl felt the need to apologise for the guys behaviour to the bar tender.  but she didn't.  The next idea was to find a bar called Publus which was supposed to be really lovley.  Bar Rock ws really lovely inside, decor wise.  So if Publos was even nicer. the girl was intrigued.  She thogut she knew her way.. and said so.  He disagreeed.  but then decided to try out her direction.  She had always claimed to ahve a great sense of direction but tonight it failed her.  Instead of a road.  they came to a sand path.  And thus they hiked in the dark along the fence.  listening to the soudn of night creatures.  in sandals , without lights she feared her every step.  He offered her a hand but she was independent and didn't want his assitance.  fianly they saw an opening in the gate.  they took. it.  suddenly a train appear!! IT's lights head towards them.  They stood back and watched it flood bye, beeping at them.  when the train had passed the crossed the track and were met by another fence.  At this point the girl wracked with fear and nervousness was ready to turn back.  The boy suggested walking along the track a bit.  they did.  and within 15 metres there was an opening in the fence.   they crossed into a neighbourhood.   he dodged all her questions.  Waht's your family like? who is you best friend?  The girl wanted to dig into the detail of this boys life.  She wanted to know whay he was so aggresive and why he was so aloof and impatient and extreme.  He didn't answer He didn't want to talk.  he wanted silence.  but silence made her uncomforable with him.  They arrived at Publos.  IT was a hole in the ground.  But a hole with charm.  They sat on couches.  the girl bought the round this time.  another German beer for him which he downed as quickly as the last time.  A banana cream cocktail for her.  Which he spilled.  In a clumsy just from couch to couch he banged the table and her drink spilled.  fine, cuz she didn't want to finish it anyways.  One of the stray cats in the neighbourhood was on the couch and  trying to eat his shirt.  (all the more reason why dogs rule and cats drool.. scary scary creatures).  The girl was eager to get out of the pub .  she was embarrased by his aggressive manner and clumbsiness.  Yet at the same time she wanted to be a firend to him.  She didn't know what to make of the situation.  She was happy that he was going away for the weekend and that she woulnd't feel the need to offer to see him again.  In sum,  the desert adventure had been thrilling.  But in the future, she would be more careful in chosing her companions.
