And uh, walking back into the house all wet lol, gosh seriously i haven't done really anything like that...its a rush when your tryin to hide away from the people in the gym walking out and the people at the table lol.  So ya anyway, im going to be babysitting for this 10 yr.old named Samantha. I've met her once before and she's a smart cookie, her brother is 12 i think and he's already been accepted to 4 colleges!! Im serious i swear to god.  So yup, im bored. Jesse called keith...wow his voice changed(jesse's) I answered the phone and he was like laughing and he was like......uhhh is keith there..in like a very low voice , i was like holy crap.
