Because I'm bored ... and I really should be doing homework - this is going to leave a LOT of work for me to do tomorrow night ... oh well! That's tomorrow, and Rove's not on tomorrow!   Anyway, hopefully you'll get daily posts from me, about nothing in particular ...  Anyway, since I've got nothing really interesting to say, I'll go now, and come back tomorrow night - hopefully with something good to report.  See ya!!!
