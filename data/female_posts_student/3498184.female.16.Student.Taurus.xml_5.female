I only have to work on sat and sun, but I have to give up a lot of stuff. I'm gonna start next weekend, and work until october. It's going to be long 10 hour days, but It's money, and I can sleep in on the weekends. Em said i'm gonna like the people there too. I hope so, hope they don't hate me...I already have an insider though...(Thanks Em ;)) Well, I can't go on my 4th of july vaca with Alex anymore, and I can't go on the "girls day out" thing I usually do with my mom, aunt and my grandma. It's sad, but true. I might have to give up my annual vaca with Alexia. I think it will be worth it though....good-bye childhood :(.   ~Bailey
