It may be for the fact I wanted to get married – for the sake of wearing a dress. It may be for the fact that there faced in front of me a seamless opportunity to get married – perfect in all ways mentionable – the weather, the milieu  (Darling Harbour – who wouldn’t?). It may be for the fact that my infatuation was rather augmented by the debutante which was held the following day.   One issue.  No partner. Hahah s’if I’d get married now.   Marriage is consecrated. Marriage is more than a sacrament. Marriage is the Dignity  enriching of human love; a special relationship designed to weather all kinds of hardship. Marriage is a summation – a bringing together of two people, two families, two societies  rich in symbolism  expression. Marriage is a convenant between man, woman  God. Marriage is God's love.   'You gave man the constant help of woman so that man  woman should no longer be 2 but 1 flesh  you teach us that what you have united may never be divided. Father you have made the union of man  wife so holy a mystery, symbolizing the marriage of Christ  His church.'   But who exactly knows,  'Who the one for them is?'  I mean, who would know, that upon encountering that special somebody for the very first time, that one day they would marry them  share a life with them. What feeling? What emotion? What love? Is it really God's plan? Is he/she really the one? How can you tell?   Love.  Only deserves the best.  You.  Only deserve the best in love - God 's love.  Love yourself.   How can you love somebody before learning how to love yourself. Accept your faults, accept your traits, accept everything you are. They will love you for you. Not who you are because of them.   You know who you are.  -- feelin good ;) --
