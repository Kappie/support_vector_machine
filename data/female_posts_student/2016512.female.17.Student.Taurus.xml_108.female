Lawrence was alright. it was nice, but it didn't really grab me as a "i should be here" type thing. Mac kind of had the same overall affect. i don't know maybe it's because i'm all toured out and would rather not listen to a student talk for an hourabout the many pluses to   *blegh* i'm also out of interviewing mode. i just got back from a crappy interview at Mac. i didn't like the woman much. but the people at UWS and Lawrence were awesome. *go them*  besides such excursions i have been able to do a good deal of thrifting. but i'm still in search of a lamp. i haven't come across a nice one yet. oh well there's always tomorrow. what else...well i've finished two puzzles over the week. one 1000 piece and the other 500. i guess that's what you get when you hang around with this sort o' crowd. ah well i love puzzles. i can even be a bit obsessive about completing, but hey i've got drive.   other happenings -i was asked out to a barbecue by some boy at a pool. that was odd. ummm...i've been deemed the navigator by my mom, who now believes that i might actually have a sense of direction. psssh. what a maroon. *circa 1920s* we haven't done much touristy shtuff, but i have been taking quite a few pics. at least 24. i only have one roll with me. lily would be ashamed, but i'll be alright. tonight my mom, aunt, uncle, and i will be "pigging out" after my aunts weigh in at weight watchers. she's going strong and i guess thursday nights are her time to endulge. we're heading out to Red Lobster for a night on the town. i think i'm going to the lake tomorrow with my sis. i haven't seen her for awhile so hopefully that will go well. and then perhaps see a play. woot!  sorry for all the horrible paragraphing and such, but i know you all can handle it.  How have you touch your community? (interview question from hell) -Betso
