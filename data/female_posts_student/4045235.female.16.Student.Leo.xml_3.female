I woke up at an unearthly time (5:30!!!) half asleep and got myself looking perfect  beautiful for my first day. I met Lisa  her mom a couple minutes before 7 and we drove to school. I had all my stuff laid out and crap, so when I got there all I had to do was drop of my Kleenex (one teacher asked for kleenex! i haven't seen that on a 'supply' list since kindergarten!) and head to first block... on the WAY, however, I was stopped in the hall b/c I was wearing spaghetti straps, and I almost had to go home and change because this lady was mean! I mean, it's my first day and I'm new... give me a break. But my teach didn't care and no one else said anything the entire day.... anyway, on to Honors Civics and Economics. Boring. The teacher was nice and I sat next to a soph. girl that was really nice. We did a couple partner and group projects and got a huge o' text book and were done. Then I headed off to chorus (I found out my partner steph had chorus next too, so I didn't get lost :) and I sat all by my lonesome in the front row, but some other new people came. I love the chorus teacher, but chorus today was really boring because we handed out forms and talked about rules and crap. But we did some cool warm-ups and I think it will be really fun. Then off to Honors Pre-Calc which was really boring and I didn't know anyone there. All our classes had assigned seats (except chorus) so... yeah. Pre calc was really boring and we're learning trig (again!) and we got tons of homework on our first day and there's a quiz tomorrow. Then I went out to eat at Arby's with my partner from Pre-calc and 2 of her friends. It was kinda sucky because her friends only said like 2 words to me the entire time, and I felt kinda left out, but oh well, I didn't know them that well. Then we came back (on time, yeah!) and finished up and went to physics. I think physics will be a little more fun b/c the teacher made some jokes and I like the kids in my class more (I saw Lisa again there) but the whole time we talked about rules and an intro to physics. I have no idea what we talked about actually cause I was almost asleep. Plus we got another book. 3 HUGE books. Not cool, but we can keep one at home, so that's all right. Then I caught a ride w/ Lisa back to my house and called Emily (hi Emo!!) to let her know about the big day and THEN I did homework (fun fun!) All in all, the day was all right, but it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be and it sucks that I have no friends there. I can't wait to meet new people and start hanging out, but the in-between process sucks. We'll see how things turn out. Love yall and wish very much that you were here! Mwah!*
