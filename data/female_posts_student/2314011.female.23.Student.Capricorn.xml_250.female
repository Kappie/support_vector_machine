The folks left around 10 and Joe will be home from work in a bit. Been ambling around, doing laundry, drinking coffee and will soon do some afternoon pages. Starting to feel better, like myself again, getting ready to head up to the unknown tomorrow.    We had a great conversation Sunday evening about holding on to these perfect moments because we would need them to get us through the hard ones. Of course, we meant the ones in November when we'd be stressing over this project or that class and wondering why we even signed up for this shit. We talked about the pause at the top and bottom of each breath, knowing that no matter where we are, it is always with us, carrying its quiet solace and we can always stop, hold on to it, and use it to get through the next bit.    Didn't know why I was such a mess yesterday. Kept thinking that if   I   felt this way, what must he be going through, which made me want to be with him all the moreand'carry' some of it for him, as impossible as it sounds. But maybe that's what happened. And now I'm pooling my reserves, holding on to the weekend, memoriesand breaths, getting ready to take them to him.
