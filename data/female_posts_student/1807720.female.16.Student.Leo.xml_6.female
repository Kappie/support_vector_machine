I wanted something a little bit more vibrant because I am not really the conservative type but it is very nice and I actually really like it.  I also met with Anne today to talk to her about becoming catholic and that went pretty good but I don't really know where I am going to find the time to do all of this while also trying to do my school work.  Also at Super Store today I saw Claire and her Mom and they couldn't stop saying how good I looked.  Maybe I lost more weight then I thought I did cause people are really starting to notice now and I actually feel really great I mean I really like it when I hear things like that.  In the past especially there are somethings I would like to forget and I haven't even told Chels about them which is how deep those secrets are but things are starting to turn around now.  I'm getting much more confident, thinner, and much more happier and I just hope it all continues to rise.
