And it's a very oppressive feeling.  I think this is probably why I so often have dreams where I am in trouble, and I need to scream for help, but I can't get any sound to come out of my mouth.  Things move very slowly and I feel like I'm underwater, and that there is this great weight on me that I can't throw.  And it hurts.  And that's exactly what I feel like when I'm upset.  And I guess I don't say anything because when it's a dream, I always wake up.  Only now there's nothing to wake up too, because I'm already awake.  Only that's not it at all really; that's only my way of rationalizing my own silliness.
