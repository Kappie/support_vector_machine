Although I don't want to take back what I said yesterday, I do want to add a little too it. I love my boyfriend very much and I never want to be without him. But I think we will have to make some changes very soon. I am a leo and he is a cancer. I am not sure if this has anything to do with how our relationship is going, but I know that am way too needy and he doesn't have the energy to give me as much as I want. By saying this I am by no means blaming either one of us (this is just the way our personalities are), and the fact is that I knew all of this going into our relationship. I guess I really need to be talking to him about this instead of crying about it on here. Let's all pray that we can figure this out and come to a compromise. I guess that's all I really want to say about that.  Next big thing is that I am so stressed out right now. I am trying to lose weight while working and going to school. Also I have a book report due next week and I haven't even started reading the book. I guess tomorrow I am going to have to do something about this. WHAH WHAH WHAH!!! Okay enough complaining about myself.   I guess the last thing I want to say today is that I am very happy with the way my life is right now. (Yes even with a relationship on the rocks, school, work, and trying to work out everyday) I just want to thank God for everything I have and no matter how bad things seem, things could alway's get worse. (Hell I could be working at TJMaxx with my life not going anywhere)
