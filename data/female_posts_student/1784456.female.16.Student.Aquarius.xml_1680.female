Hummm i'm not to sure about sleeping in the rabbit hutch, as much as i love your rabbit Katie, I really dont think me and her would fit in it!!!  Sorry about waking you all up, Jenny should really learn to keep her phone turned off!! I think she is a bit annoyed with me becasue she wont return any of my texts!!!
