I was the pitcher and second baseman haha .. it was a lot of fun. Steve and Carl also gave us shirts and wrote on them so we will remember them because they're leaving tomorrow morning. I'm so sad =*(  we're going to see if they can come back next year because steven will probally go to the camp again so that will be a lot of fun.
