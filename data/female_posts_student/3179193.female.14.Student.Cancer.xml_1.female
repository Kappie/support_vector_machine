I asked Nima why he wasn't at basketball and he said it was because his sister got in a car crash and stuff so he didn't go... he couldn't call like he said either 'cos of that. Haha... Blah... I just hope everything's alright. I talked on MSN a bit, and Candace mentioned something about walking home with Nima, Jordan, Safee, and people and that Nima was acting weird...? She said he wasn't acting like himself and was being mean... mean but not rude. I asked how and she just said he was poking people really hard and being serious and secretive... ookay? Well whatever it is that's making him do that... I hope it's not bad. Nima... he has changed a lot lately. It's just... blah. I hope it's not a bad thing. Guys really need to figure out how to handle their anger sometimes... not just anger, but emotions in general. Blah... weird. He said he'd call tonight but will he remember? Hmm... Blah. Tonight's Literacy Night...~ I wanted to go but I forgot to tell Rodway that I could help out. Oh well... I'll stay home instead. My sister's there to help out tonight.   Kortright tomorrow. Gonna bring money to buy stuff at the canteen. Don't want to bring a lunch. Too "mah fan". Aish... I'm driving myself crazy! Thinking too much! >_  I told Moca and Erica about *cough* today. I trust both of them to not say anything about it. Breathe not a word. I already told IngiEE about it a little while ago and she kept it low. I can trust her for sure always. I didn't tell Felis yet though... she seems to be pretty busy lately. Blah... I told Moca that it was gone but now it seems to have... come back a little bit. I trust myself... not gonna slip~ Hee hee! Wrote notes with Moca in History class about it. Blah... Gonna go bye-bye soon. Anyway... I'll blog later... not in the mood. Tired, arm aches, blah...
