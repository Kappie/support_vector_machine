I called Isaiah today and hung up before he picked up... naturally he called back, but a thought ran through my mind.. "would he even have called today at all??" (at this point it was almost 5.)  I felt like a murderer... I got my period today.. although i have so many reasons to not want this baby.. i was kinda hoping that i would be pregnant.... now that i am not. its really hard...   he should have called.. (in my girly eyes)
