So I read until three-ish.  Merh. Woke up at seven to the sounds of my dad fiddling in the garage.  Wasnt sure what time it was since I dont have a functioning clock in my room as of now.  So I read some more and realized how early it was a while later.  Got up anyway.  So tired. My stomach hurts.  I give up.
