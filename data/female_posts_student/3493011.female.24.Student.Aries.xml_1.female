My ex-company asked if I am interested to go back and work for them temporary while one of the ladies going for maternity leave... it'll be great working at Macquarie again...  I'm kinda in lazy and hungry mode..juz wanna eat everything and anything... it's so bloody cold..Oh yah I did heaps of washing by hands and now I'm having a sore back... I'm feeling so lethargic now.. but tonite got great shows like Queer Eye and OC... Monday nites are the best...   I'll be heading off for camp soon... on Wed to Sat.. I know God is gonna do amazing things durin this camp...last nite I ask God "God, what's my calling and where will I be in the future?" I was very persistent in getting an ans..and was being a real irritant (urm my QT lasted for 2hr) then God ask me to be still... and listen... I saw myself in a corporate gear but then I was surrounded by kids... and they seem to be Cambodian or Laotian... I look like in one of those Worldvision ads... Then God said to me, "you'll be successful, you can tread on higher grounds" and that's that... I wonder "successful in worldly terms or in spiritual terms??" I'm confuse and I ask but then God juz said "Love my people"...I dunno what this means but I'm ready to move forward into the future based on His terms.... that's why I reckon this camp is gonna be awesome...  God is Mighty...
