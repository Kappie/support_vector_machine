In other news; I am heading out to Penn on Monday, umm... visiting a bunch of colleges. Probably going to take my laptop with me (fucking ten pound rock). So if anyone wants to play starcraft: broodwars or Warcraft II or Neverwinter Nights just IM me (tevren7891), call me if you have my number or meet me in channel HSES at like 10pm. Oh by the way guys, tell me what's on the AP Physics test. Peace out.
