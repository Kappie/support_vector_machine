I Love You  I feel like I'm in heaven whenever i kiss and hug you I place no-one above you I'm serious when i say i love you You're my girl Pearls aren't good enough for you, because to me you mean the world I'm serious, you're very special to me Ask anyone who ever knew me 'Cause when I lie, you can see straight through me I'm not lieing I'm just trying to tell you how i feel Trying to deal because I know this love is real I know we're only fourteen, fifteen on the next page But who says, you can't love until a certain age? I can't even fit all of my thoughts into this poem Whenever I'm at home, and we're talkin on the phone I swear to god there's nothing better You know whenever we're together and it's cold, then I'll surely give you my sweater I used to think that love, was nothing more than a term A word, used by people who just had a lot to learn I thought that it would turn it's back on you at the first chance And storm out of the room, without a single glance But now I realize, that what the guys told me were lies Because I prove them wrong whenever I look into your eyes Danette, you're someone special and I just want you to know I hope that our relationship does nothing but grow I'm so into you, I don't know what I'm gonna do But I'm gonna show you that i'll keep on lovin' you  This poem touched me so much, and means so much to me. When Brandon gave this to me I felt like I was in the movies, because it's too good to be true. The words flow and rhyme like I've never seen before. For my first love letter, I'd have to say I could have never asked for anymore. For all of you who think that our love is fake, that the guy i'm with is using me and weirdly clingy, this proves you wrong. You can't break us apart, our love is way too strong for any of your mind tricks. I guess this is it for now, but I hope I made you all think twice about myself.
