We had church this morning, but that hardly lasts and hour in the summer. I wish I could get a job, but who's going to hire me for two weeks? No one, that's who. Do you know how bored I was today? I bought a college agebra book in Pittsburg, and I got it open, and almost started learning. (I just couldn't do it, too many painful math memories) Then I thought, well I liked spanish alot better than Math, and I bought a second year spanish text book at the library, and I pulled that out, and started to read, except I had no idea what they were saying. So then I went out and tried golfing into a net with my brother. That didn't go well. It only takes me like 5 mins to hit the balls now though. I'm improving. Oh, I coudl never be a housewife. Well I"m off to try to find something midly entertaining. Tata!
