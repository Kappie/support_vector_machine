Well, we were in her car when I noticed that I had spilled some chocolate ice cream on my sweatshirt. I was like "oh shit" and me and amanda just start laughing because I said it really funny. Then, as we were laughing I burped, and that somehow added to the humor. We both keep laughing so hard that it almost hurts. It was great. Well, then we finished our ice cream and were heading home. Little did I know that Amanda would take me to Tommy and Bobby's house. I was SCREAMING at her in the car to turn around but she wouldnt. So then she decides to call first, and she asks for Tommy, but he's in the shower, so then she asks for Bobby. She asks if Bobby would mind that I came by to say hello, and Bobby said he didn't care. So then, Amanda takes me there, and makes me go say hey. Well, since Tommy was in the shower, I just visited with Bobby for about 5-10 minutes, but then I decided it was weird enough so then we left. I'm not really sure what Bobby thought of it all, but oh well. I made it clear that Amanda took me their against my own will, so maybe he doesn't find me to be weird, but Amanda instead. Anyway, after that we are driving home and we pass Scott. He was on his way to work, so I was like "follow him!" and so Amanda turns around really fast and we begin to follow him. We catch up to him at Ricky D's (where he works) and Amanda's all like "we followed you" and Scott was all "I know, I saw you" so Amanda kinda got mad that she listened to my suggestion. We decided that we were even now. Hmmm...I wonder if Tommy will ask about me going to his house. Hmm..oh well. That was the extent of my evening so far, but I don't think it will be getting anymore exciting. I'll blog tomorrow maybe.
