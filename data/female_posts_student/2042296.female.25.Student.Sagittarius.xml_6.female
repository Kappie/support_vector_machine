We slept this morning somewhat badly, I didn't have enough blanket or space etc. We kept on keeping each other wake;) Then Rico went to lay on the couch, I followed him a little bit later and then we were there together, somehow in each other's arms. Sweet;) We woke up slowly and gently and it was wonderful. Then we went shopping, drove to Glattzentrum to shop in Globus. Globus has the best delicatessen department I've seen here so far. And the service is great! But then again, everything costs "a bit" more than elsewhere. WE bought some fine fish and large shrimps and some good wine and...and... Ooooh yessss... We also popped into the book store to look at some books and I'm still dreaming of buying muse-parfum (joop!) ;)  Hence, this day has mainly been wonderful sex, amazing food and wine... A perfect Saturday! So, gotta go cooking!
