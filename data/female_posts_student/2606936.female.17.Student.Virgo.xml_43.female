We were mad mad mad mad madly in love. We were best friends, and more, and soooo happy.   It's funny how double dates tend to highlight stuff in different couples. Like when Vicky and her bf of 2 years, and my blind date and I, went out together...... it was weird because they're so comfortable, while we we afraid to touch elbows. Stuff like that.  You see, it was a strange but great coincidence how my best friend and his best friend - we'll call them Boy and Girl - began dating a few days after us. Naturally, we double-dated all the time. Our relationships moved at the same rate and it was just nice - you get to spend the day with three of your best friends, one of which is the person you LURV.  Just, ya know, fun. Innocent, first-love excursions, holding hands in the mall or sitting on each others' laps at a coffee shop. The four of us, in our clearly-defined couples. So cute, so sweet.  Now, while Boy was much shorter than Girl, B and I fit that old "girl-should-be-smaller" standard. But not in a funny way, like Nixie and Timmy, who are 5'0" and 6'3", respectively.  So which couple got the stares? Which couple got looks ranging from amusement to disapproval every time they went out? Which couple wouldn't have been identified as a couple but for the linked arms? Which couple was just "wrong?"  I guess the little stuff does matter. Stuff like how I'm white, and B is black. Ya know. Just that.  It's weird for me, having been a sheltered white girl, raised without any trace of racism, how it works. How people I don't even know can look at me, standing with someone I love more than anything in the world, and tell me with their gaze that we're not right, that I can't love him, that it's unnatural, that it sickens them, that I'm being stupid and deviant and that I'm WRONG.   If you've never been there, thank someone.  Funny how that translates. How my thinking about this, my first actual encounters with prejudice, somehow led to that ongoing question everyone faces - "is it okay for people to be gay?"  And suddenly, I thought, "I'm not gay. It's none of my business whom they love, because it doesn't affect me at all. How could I ever turn around and say that people couldn't be in love after knowing how that feels?"  I realy wish all the stupid uptight prejudiced cowards of America would just take a friggin' step back and look at themselves. Thank God that you're not homosexual, because we will never have to live the life they do. We will never have to struggle for  the right to love someone.  We will be able to marry the people we love. We will not get those stares everywhere we go. We will not live our lives set apart from so many others who are too afraid of opening their minds to try and care about another human being.  What kind of world is this, that I have to be thankful not to be in a minority? WHat the hell kind of world are we creating for the future? There's no way I'm having children. I'm not bringing a child into a world that's so full of hate it outlaws  marriage.    My God, people! Live and let live! Not everyone lives by your religious rules!  WHatever happened to "majority rules WITH MINORITY RIGHTS"? Whatever happened to a man and woman being the same in the eyes of the law? Pursuit of happiness? Not infringing needlessly on others' rights, maybe? I dunno.  U.S.A.?  That's funny, I thought this was the United  Christians  of America. But hey, since the majority doesn't want to let gay people get married, gays obviously don't matter. Who cares if we're barring people from living the happy lives they deserve?  Some people think it's gross!   YOU KNOW WHAT'S GROSS? HOW MUCH AMERICANS SUCK. We act like "Oh, we love everyone, oh, we're so free and open here, and we all have our rights, blah blah blah" and then we turn around and complete ignore people. What a shitty era. God, I hate hate. I hate hate. I hate hate.  Nice country, where people are free to live and love and speak and work and learn and worship the way they want.   Maybe someday I'll get to live there.
