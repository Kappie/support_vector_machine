Hiroshi, a friend of mine who studies in Germany, bought a branded cellphone (a Motorola V525) from Vodafone and wanted to get rid of all these annoying softbuttons and restrictions vodafone applies to their models. Most of you who got deeper into this issue already know that there is a website called  urlLink MotClub  which provides access to most of the files needed for flashing. Hiroshi tried them all, but none worked, but fortunately he found another source to obtain the Flash file for the V600 (which is known to work even with V300 cellphones). Following  urlLink this  link will give you all the information and software you need to flash your phone (assuming you are a lucky owner of a datacable). The mentioned flash file works as expected, those from MotClub may not, according to Hiroshi.  Thanks to Hiroshi.
