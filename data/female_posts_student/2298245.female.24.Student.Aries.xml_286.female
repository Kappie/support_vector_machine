Money quote (as he would say):   My stomach lurches at the thought of another terror attack while Kerry is president. What would be his first response: reach for a dog-eared copy of the early Sartre? Look, Eliot is a spectacular poet. I've read him year after year after year. I dramatized the "Four Quartets" at Harvard. But that's not a qualification for the presidency.   There's simply nothing I don't love about this quote.  Eliot's my favorite poet, hands down, and the stuff about Kerry is right too.  Then, to top it off, Sullivan provides this Kerry statment, quoted in an  urlLink op-ed piece by Maureen Dowd  (this will probably be the last time I post a link to anything by her, so don't get used to it, but it really is kind of an amusing read):   "I remember flying once; I was looking out at the desert and I wrote a poem about the barren desolation of the desert. I wrote a poem once about a great encounter I had with a deer early in the morning that was very moving."   Look, I'm a writer myself, and I've written poetry from time to time.  But if I ever said anything as remotely silly as this about something I'd written, I'd have a lot to apologize for.  And I'm not running for President.  To quote Sullivan:  "Oh God.  Four years of  this ?"
