Today I don't have school so I slept in tilll 9! *woot* My sister was workng on school work so I practiced my piano for like an hour, I was THAT bored. Then I cleaned my room for like the first like in 6 months. It was odd. I found 15 cents! *woot* I am rich!!!!!! My sister is finally done so now I am here. What a boring day. Later, I am going to clean. Great... at least I get paid.   Â¡Randomness! "Someday my prince will come" I like Relient K I get to go to a Superchic[k] concert in 9 days!!!!!!   Gosh..that was short. My mind is laking this morning.  well...i guess this is bye.  Love, Laura   P.S. My poetry skills are lacking,        But Marquette still deserves a sacking.  :P :P  :P Thats for YOU Taylor!
