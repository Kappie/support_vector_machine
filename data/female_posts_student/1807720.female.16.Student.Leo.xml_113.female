That chem test today was so stupid.  Half of the stuff we didn't even learn or talk about.  I studied soooooooo hard for that and I am pretty sure I failed.  It upsets me so much.  Its so discouraging when I try and I try and I try and alot of times I fail and I fail and I fail.  It's like the more I try the more I fail.  It doesn't make anysense.  If I do fail that test like I predict then there is DEFINETLY something wrong because I ASKED A MILLION QUESTIONS and I STUDIED MORE HOURS THAN I CAN COUNT ON TWO HANDS and I KNOW FOR A FACT I PUT MY VERY  *BEST* effort forward.  I don't know what to do anymore.  I thought this was the chance to raise my mark, but I think that I was wrong.  I just feel so bad, and I think I really scared my friends or something.  They even said "don't do anything rad...no knifes or razors.  I must have been more upset at school then I remember right now.  But I am really upset.  But I made plans with Megz after the Math final and she is going to sleep over that night too and we are going to prepare our monologues for our the auditions for the play.  I can't wait!  Once I get through finals I get to have fun, but right now I am very concerned about my chem mark.
