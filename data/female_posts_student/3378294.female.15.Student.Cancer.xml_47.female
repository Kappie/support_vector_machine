She had been the bookies favourite for the past six weeks, but in my opinion it was either her or Dan who were destined for the stardom and money they deserve. it was soo sweet when Nadia's mother came out- she had come all the was from portugal and her and Nadia hadnt seen each other for over a year! it was... *sniff*  heart wrenching!
