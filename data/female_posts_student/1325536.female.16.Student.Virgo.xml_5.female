His current employers who also let him board with them had decided to leave for a vacation to the Virgin Islands. It was the twenty-one year old's second year working at Sweet Delight-- a lovely little candy store that was quite liked in the neighborhood. Over the time Joel had worked part time (he only worked full time in the summer since he was attending college) he'd demonstrated that he was more than able to handle the affairs for the next few weeks. Besides the responsibilities that came with completely taking care of the business, he was also babysitting their son, Damien, who was twelve.  When the car could no longer be seen, Joel turned around and headed back into the store, a bell ringing when the door opened. Light blue eyes glanced around the shop, making sure that everything was in order. Joel gave a content sigh, pleased that he didn't need to straighten up anything. He was also happy that the store would be closing soon. He strode over behind the counter and turned on the radio, tapping his fingers to the addicting pop beat. The song was sickeningly sweet and on the pathetic side. Joel preferred rock with angry, screamed lyrics, but obviously that wasn't suitable to be playing in this type of environment.  He looked down at his watch, growing a little impatient that he still had around thirty minutes left before he could begin closing up the store.  "Damien should be back soon," Joel commented.  And somehow that realization caused a small grin to form on his place.
