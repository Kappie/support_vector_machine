I have loved you since we first became friends back in high school and I will love you forever.  We're friends, best friends and that will never change in my heart and my mind.  So stop friggin doubting yourself and start focusing on your amazing qualities and everything that makes me want to be around you. I adore you and even when we don't talk and even when we don't see each other you are on my mind.  You're my family, you may not be blood but you will eternally be part of my family and I adore you.  Always remember that.
