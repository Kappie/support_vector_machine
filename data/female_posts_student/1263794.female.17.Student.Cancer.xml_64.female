I'm about 100 pages behind in Huck Finn, and Mrs. Schmitz made me feel so bad about not doing the reading that I'm actually really trying to complete it by tomorrow. Don't you hate it when teachers make you feel bad about not doing your work. O YEAH and I can't forget this play that Mrs. Rasnick assigned us to read by Monday. AHHHH my only easy class backfired.   On a higher note, I went to see The Fantasticks at Enloe on Thursday. I had actually been wanting to see that show for quite a while, so I was pretty excited but it turned out to be pretty corny. Don't get me wrong they did a great job, but it was a musical and I think there were a total of 2 songs I really liked. But it did make me laugh and it was an enjoyable night. AND we made it there on time. (easier said than done)  Katie's party was fun. The food was awesome, seriously they had like my dream snack table. NICE.   Halloween was fun too. The first Halloween I got to drive with my friends BY OURSELVES.   Well back to the books...
