We couldn't....hell season passes are the best way to keep kids busy during the summer...just have to be smart about packing a lunch.  I hope you guys all have a very HAPPY 4th of July.  Ed is going to be home until the 4th and won't be home until the 25th.  Geez...I hardly get to see him these days.  I pray that God give me the strength to get through the time he is gone and that God keeps him safe from harm.  I know all I can do is pray.  I am starting to have a hard tims sleeping at night due to anxiety.  ...and the cycle starts...
