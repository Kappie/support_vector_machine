YAY!!!!!  ahhhh.....  life is good!!  just watch, tomorrow will be crap.  we have the Mousetrap Derby on wednesday, but we get out early, so it's all gravy!!!  that means shortened classes!!!!!  anyway, the Grammys were pretty bad.  there are normally pretty boring, but they were espcially bad this year.  i honestly think norah jones is a bit overrated, but i'm also glad that avril lavigne got robbed, so it's balanced.    things that made my day good: 1. pizza hut breadsticks 2. hotties {see Feb. 11th post 3. extenstion on my language arts project 4. not a lot of homework 5. understanding algebra 6. understanding science 7. understanding social studies 8. life-size ping-pong in gym 9. listening to jay-z  things that made my day bad: NOTHING!!!  random ramblings: ~martin scorsese is the bomb!!!!! ~US Weekly is my favorite magazine ~i want to be famous when i grow up, but will not attend the Grammys unless they turn it into a disco inferno!!  *sings*roller coaster of love oooh oooh ooooh oooh oooh!!!!!*  quote of the day: "If it weren't for the last minute, nothing would get done." -- Anonymous
