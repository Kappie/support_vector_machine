I almost can't stand to look at Beth anymore after struggling so much with the paper, and I saw her handle the whole pile, which probably means that she's going to be reading them, so when she gets around to mine, she'll know more than she should of my thought processes. There are just some people in that class who are constantly more insightful than I am, quite apparent when they speak up in class, and that probably translates to more insightful papers. Unlike mine. It's just annoying, since I loved the class until we got to the paper. I thought hey, maybe psych won't have to be that great since lit will be, and I'll enjoy it--enjoy it meaning I like the material, and I'm good at it. But obviously, that's not the case.  And that's just lit to start with.   Anthro's all right except I only got a check on my second response paper, which I got back today. The last one I got a check-plus-plus (here I start laughing) and savored a little secret joy for the whole entire week. Apparently, I got a little too complacent...or formulaic? Jenn came up with this theory of how the second check on the first paper could carry over and I'd even it out...though I doubt it works that way. I get the impression that either the professor isn't stellar, or we (the students) aren't. Maybe it's a combination of both. He's a mild Ballard case: he'll go off telling stories of his field work in the Amazon, which is perfectly fine but then again I have to wonder the significance of even being a corporeal form in William James Hall at 1 on Tuesdays and Thursdays: the final is all based on stuff on handouts and in the books. And we're not that brilliant either. Either the adults go off on pseudo-intelligent topics or the kids are just lost. Or we're all too timid, generally.  More and more I've come to think that I only enjoy things when I'm good at them. Attraction and success are simultaneous and have to be instantaneous...life is just too hard not doing well.   So as I was walking back from Annenberg, I was seriously considering USC, as lame as that sounds. Harvard's still my dream school and will always be, but how much of a dream will it be when I get in and have to suffer the kind of academic strain that I saw in Vicky Ho? Won't life be easier in a school where the SAT average is probably in the 1300s? Would the prospect be sweetened by the 8-year baccalaureate/med program?  The only thing that honestly buoys me up is the company of friends. I almost completely forgot about that troublesome essay last night when we were just hanging out in 16, half reading and half laughing and yelling and eating microwaved cookies. Except I have to go back on the reading now and take careful notes. Jenn and Charlie and Matt won't be here on Sunday, which really makes me wonder what I'm going to do. Read Kafka? Anthro? Wander around and shop?  It's just this feeling that I just can't shake off. But as persistent as it may sound, I still walk around as if I'm in some sort of depressing daze, as if I  don't want to shake it off.
