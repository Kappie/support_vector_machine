You see, the Rock will give me better hours during school so i'll still be able to do after school activities, i'll also get to work more days.  But at Little Italy, i get better money. Right now i'm working 3 nights a week for 4 hours a night making in between 7 and 15 dollars an hour. But also in the waitressing industry, its never steady pay, people are jack asses and stiff you of a tip a lot. SO i'm making on average about $90 a week including tips and paycheck. Not bad at all. But at the Italian House, i can't dye my hair, can't have any visable piercings either. At the Rock you can. I'm trying to make a decision. I think i'm going to quit I House...... tell me what you think.  Really bored. I don't know what to write about..... hm.... Ginnie left at 4 in the morning today to go to Montana for 2 weeks. It'll be lonely without my wife for a while. :'( tear. My birthday's in 10 days! exciting... finally going to be 16! yes i know, its not really that big of a deal, but still! I'M SO EXCITED! eeeee!  The knitting needles are waiting.
