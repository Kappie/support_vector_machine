She asked me whats wrong, and I told her the same thing. She said you need to let go, i know you don't want too but you need too. Don't let him get to the point to where he hates you. I think thats the best advice my mom's ever given me. Then she broke down and cried. She said she knows I think its the end of the world, but it will get better. We all loved him, but you need to let him go. Trying to make him feel something that he doesn't isn't gonna help the situation. In the end it will all work out, you watch. I've never wanted to believe my mom so much before.   So God, if you read blogs please stop by and read mine. I pray that everything works out for all of us. I pray that someday things do get better and that I will reflect back and still think that all this pain was worth it. I pray for everyone who has been there for me. I pray that I will somehow manage to get my feelings in check, and learn that not everything goes the way that you think it will.
