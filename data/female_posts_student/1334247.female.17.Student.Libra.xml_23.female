I really haven't been out doing a whole lot, just work and hanging out with Matthew, but I've been having fun with it. I start my summer English Composition class tomorrow morning (8-11 AM). I skimmed through the book when I got it, and it looks like a super deluxe easy class. I'm not too worried, but watch me get in there and it's very hard....hmmm, I kinda doubt it. :)
