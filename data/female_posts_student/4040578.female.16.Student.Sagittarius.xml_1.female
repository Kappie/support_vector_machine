I know, that may sound childish, but I don't even understand why I am that way.  Sometimes, even when it just thunderstorms I rush everything into the hallway and just sit there and pray that the storm will pass quickly.  I do find it really embarrassing when it storms and I have guests over. Cause then I get into this like mean mode telling people to shut up so I can watch the weather station. Sometimes when it is really bad I freak out and start crying and pacing. And yes, I have done that even with a guest over. Thankful he was such a sweetie and just held me in his arms.   But yeah, I think that is also why I love the fall and winter so much cause then I don't have to worry about a twister or lighting scaring me.      Moving on, yes today was on the rainy side. I was awaken at 6am to take out the trash. Yeah, so that was weird, I was hardly awake walking all crooked and what not. So then after that I went back to sleep until 12. I sat around until 4. My dad came home and we planned on going to Khols. So I was like yay, maybe I can get a purse now.  But on one condition, that I take the empty trash cans back around to the back. Here my sis was already told to do that since I had carried them full out front in the first place. Well, her being the not responsible daughter  doesn't do what she is told and just leaves for work while she runs over the trash cans backing out...sheesh. So yeah, I did as I was told.  We finally left and went to Shoe Carnival and Khols. Shoe Carnival is having a sale on their "chuckies" , I so want a black and blue pair. But didn't get them. Then we leave to go to Khols.  Dad didn't buy anything there so since he didn't, I did not want to push it to get my purse.  We looked around a little more. But we didn't get anything there either so we left. By the way, when I walked it I saw some old Eagledalians. My boy Justin and then Jonathan. It was great to see Justin again. Brings back alot of memories. I did feel bad cause I wasn't looking my greatest  o well though, come on, it was an icky day out. So yeah, after all that I didn't get to see a radar yet so I asked my dad if we could just go home, and we did. Well, I came home got yelled at by Leah for not waiting for her to get off work to be able to leave with us. Question: Do I do anything right? So then sat around alittle more until Leah told me maybe I should apply at where she works, the Harrison. So I was like sure, I neeeeeeeeeed money. She says she will take me over there and fill out an application and then she can go pick up some dinner, I agreed.Question: Why don't people want me? I am someone who WANTS to work, yes...you read correctly, I WANT to work. Anywho,we were off. I got the application and sat in the car, filled it out, and turned it in. That application would be number 5. We went got her some Arby's and headed home. I walk in the door to find my mom sitting at my pc playing Literati. So, I give my mom a time limit for when she has to get off.  Mom was being sneaky, I think, and after one game she started another. I was like ooook, this IS your last game young lady. I thought I would be a really responsible person and I cleaned house while she played. That's so jacked. So yeah, I vaccuumed,puts some clothes in the dryer , and folded them.  By that time it was time for her to get off. I do so much, I need a break...hahaha. So now here I sit, I guess that is my break then.      Ok, well now the fun fact learned today was Br√® is a baby, waw waw. But a cute one, riiiiiiight?...hehe. I do appreciate the comments by my peepos, I feel special. So anywho, I am outtie!
