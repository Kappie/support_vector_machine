I've got the play, dance, KB, the band formerly known as pep, and homework.  so today i had piano. it was rather enjoyable. i finally get to work on a new piece of music. and i think i know my order for my recital. *te he* exciting. i do need some people to sing, dance, play an instrument, or recite poetry. it doesn't really matter. but i have 2 breaks so i need someone to fill the time during it. god knows i wouldn't last if i didn't have a break. 2 of my songs are 20 mins long. *sigh*   this weekend i have dance competition and state piano. i don't really care about either of them i'm just excited to see my sister. yay! it was her birthday on the 4th so it's kind of cool that we get to see her. happy quarter of a century!  other news...i'm missing two and a half days of school this week. it's quite a leap from the average--at least one day gone per week--i should really stay in school. oh well. life goes on.  the band formerly known as pep is struggling lately. i don't think the 2nd trumpets can read music and that makes me hurt. especially when i have to stand infront of them. goll dang it pick a note and play it. don't keep fumbling around trying to find the right one. -p.s-they didn't find the right note :(   And so ends our broadcast day (cue anthem), -Betso  P.S - This is fun-- urlLink Hobbit Name Generator --I'm Peony Bleeker-Baggins of Fair Downs. (I'm related to Frodo) *te he* And my Elvish Name is Silmarwin Falassion. That was fun.
