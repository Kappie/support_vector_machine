How could such a powerful elf such as yourself allow this to happen?" the owner of the footsteps mocked.    "Well, stranger, perhaps you shouldn't be talking, if you had to rely on 'a pathetic old man living on borrowed time' to capture me," Andolin paused to smile.  "I can sense your prowess.  You're aura is so dark; why didn't you use that awesome power to capture me yourself?"  "You are a sly one, aren't you?  Then again, your whole family is like that, Dragonrider."  "As if you even know my family," Andolin commented bitterly.  "Your whole clan was slaughtered, except you.  They had power to control dragons, but a dragon wouldn't even let you come within a five meter radius of it.  Your mother's last words were, "Don't forget your lineage," which she uttered while you were trying your best to save the last member of your family.  "What a sad ending to such an exciting story."  Andolin stood and walked over to the bars.  "How do you know that, wizard?" she asked with a slight hint of anger seeping through.  "Your mother died in the depths of the forest, did she not?  Trees rarely forget such morbid occasions, especially when a maiden as fair as yourself is crying."  Andolin's face paled slightly.  How could this wizard know?  They were alone when her mother's life energy faded.  Andolin sunk down to her knees.  "Brings back memories, doesn't it?"  "No!  I won't believe you!"  Andolin covered her head, trying feebly to block the sorcerer's voice.  "Lost your confidence?  Most do in the face of Death."  "I'm not dying!" the elf screamed.  "Not yet, but once I drain you of your soul, your life energy, than you will only wish for Death.  You will always see the Reaper close to you, but far away, hungry for a soul.  You will have immortality, but you will be a shell."  Andolin shook violently.
