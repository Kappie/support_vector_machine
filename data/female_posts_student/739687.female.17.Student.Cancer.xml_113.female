But year by year reality began to take hold My dreams fell victim to dust and rust I slowly let pieces of my past turn dark and cold But I couldn’t dwell on that past; I had to adjust.  It took some time to uncover my lost goals Though never again would they shimmer and gleam Now I look back with a sigh at my childish soul And my bright blue eyes, harboring uniquely crafted dreams; Dreams that now are gone.  Well, that's all of that. Luv ya, bye bye crazies.
