She said that she was going to be late for work, only she didn't say it in english. I told her that was fine. "Ok, bye Kyoko," she answered. I lay in bed for a few minutes thinking about the coffee shop, that's when I realized what happened. "I don't work in a coffee shop," I told myself, "I work at the salon, I own the salon." I jolted upright. Where was I? It wasn't my room, it wasn't my apartment. I went over to the window and looked down at the street and it wasn't my town. Then my mind faded and Kyoko's  mind took over. I showered and got ready for work. I got into my Camry and drove to Hair and Nails. On the way I got into a small traffic jam and rattled my long, polished nails on the steering wheel. I got to the salon and unlocked the doors, swept the floor, shook up some bottles of nail polish and turned on the open sign. Then a woman came in, "morning Julie," she chimed brightly, "where's Nat?" "She'll be in late today, I'm guessing her date went well." I heard my voice speaking english, the language I have spoken every day of my life, I could barely understand myself through my thick, japanese accent. The woman's name was Terry, she was middle aged, a little heavy set, and had a mass of tight blonde curls sprouting from her head. Terry towered over me, she was about 5-7 or 5-8, I probably stood about 5-1 at the most. Together we got the salon ready for customers. At twenty-three past eight, the first customer came in. "Good morning Ma'am, can I help you?" She told me what kind of hair cut she wanted and I took her to my station. I saw my beautician's license mounted on the wall above a picture of an asian woman holding sushi with chopsticks and smiling at the camera, she was my best friend. I had the customer sit down, I put the cloth over her clothes and picked up the scissors, then I froze. I didn't know how to cut hair, give me coffee beans and I'll make you a latte, but hair? No, that wasn't my division. I stared down at the woman's head holding the scissors in my left hand. I thought for a moment and transferred the scissors to my right hand and snipped the air. It was difficult, it didn't feel right. I moved the scissors back to my left hand and it felt natural. I picked up the spray bottle, combed her hair with my right hand, and then started cutting with my left hand. Just another day at the shop. Cutting hair, doing nails, this was my life.  During my lunch break I went back to being Carly again. I had gone to a restaurant and ordered miso soup. I sipped it, and spat it out again. "What was I thinking ordering this? I hate miso soup", I thought. But I didn't hate miso soup, it was my favorite thing to eat. Who was I, I wasn't myself. I picked out my brain, my name was Kyoko Yammamoto. But then why did Terry call me Julie? That was my American name, it was easier for people to pronounce. The woman in the picture with the sushi, my best friend, Takako, we came to the States together five years ago. It was a weird dream, it had to be, My name was Carly Morgan, my best friend was Tarissa. I had always lived in the U.S.  I took a deep breath, then another one, and another. I was having a panic attack
