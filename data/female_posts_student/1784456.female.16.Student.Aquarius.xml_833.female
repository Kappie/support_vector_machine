(cadbury's chocolate, get it?) okay so unfunny thing of the year. i think shiva is actually a really cool name for a cactus with eight arms. about ice skating i dont know when but not tuesday cos i have to go to the awfuldontist. do you that since i've had my brace theres a gap between my two bottom teeth that was'nt there before. correct me if i'm wrong but is'nt a brace supposed to mend gaps not MAKE THEM?
