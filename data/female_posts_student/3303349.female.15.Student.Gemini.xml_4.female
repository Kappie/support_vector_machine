An overwhelming amount of people said no. But the thing that really struck my nerve was a quote at the bottom of the article; "It's too immoral for most Montanans to even consider." What is so diffrent about a marrage of a homosexual couple from the marrage of a heterosexual couple? Other than the differing of sexs, of course. If two people are so in love that they fell they are ready to take the plunge and get married then what should hold them back? Certanly not the law. How about we just ban all marrage, that would be fair. fairer than what is going on. Consider that.
