I've learned so much through our studies, and I know that I will learn so much more on our trip. We're leaving from church at 3:30 on Saturday morning, our flight out of Indy leaves at 7:00, we get into Miami around 10:45, then we get to sit in the airport for almost 4 hours.  We end up getting to the Bahamas around 6 or 7 I think.  We will get back to church around 9:30 at night on July 31.  Please pray for traveling safety, outreach, and group unity.  It should be a great, life changing trip! *A quick note to my team- I have never met a cooler, more Godly group of people.  I love you all so much (even though I don't always show it).  It's gonna be awesome!*  And he won a free book off the radio.
