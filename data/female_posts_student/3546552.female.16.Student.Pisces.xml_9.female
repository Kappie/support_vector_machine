At lunch time we went to a character dining room where we met these two guys  Isaac  and  Ethan . We walked around with them afterwards and went on a river boat cruise for awhile. They were very friendly. Next the four of us went to  Space Mountain , but it was raining so hard we were soaked by the time we got there and didn't feel like waiting in the 90 minute long line. Instead, we went up to this abandoned ride/building and talked with each other for over an hour. At the end of the day we made plans to meet at the water park tomorrow and I am excited to see them again. It's nice to have more people our age to hang out with.  I hope you at home are having a nice time, ... let me know! Love you all... and a  holla  out to my  M.R ! goodnight all.
