We had so much fun at my dad's house playing v-ball, jet-skiing, tubing, swimming, "golf carting" and...ATV-ing...of course, the most exciting part was when Shaun and Andrew tipped the ATV and Andrew ended up in the ER, but otherwise it was a very fun, and quite successful party! I wish you had been there...and I wish you had called when you got home, like you said you would...unless you're not home yet...in which case, I think you are way to fascinated with airplanes! LOL, no jp, I hope you had fun and I'll see you tomorrow MR. Goodnight! ~BS
