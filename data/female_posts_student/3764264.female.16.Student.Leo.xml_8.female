I woke up this morning and my legs were wrapped around my blankets and I was thinking of Erich and I suddenly got this really good feeling. I thought of sex.     I started moving my hips on the blankets and got very  very  horny. I mean... Frig. in a second I could go from relaxed and half asleep to THAT. (mind you I was still half asleep) And ohhh... I was thinking how easy sex would be on a foamy*, (thats what my bed is partially made on) and I started pushing faster... And oh my god I don't think I could ever describe how I felt. It wasn't an orgasm... just ohh... dear.     And all of this happened in a span of less than ten seconds. Then I just fell back asleep. I'm not quite sure how, but lets just say it was a very nice sleep. When I woke up again I spent the good portion of the hour thinking of Erich and being on top of him. (To note: I had perfect clarity on the issue. Meaning I didn't  think  anything that would be... uncomfortable for either of us, physically or mentally... if he was really there) Which made the thoughts even MORE sexy for some reason.     It was kind of a release for me. It felt tremendously good and concidering the pressure I've been under, the lack of Erich being online, and lack of anything terribly fun going on.     I didn't touch myself at all. I find when I do, it makes me feel dirty and I  rarely even start to feel that orgasm thing startanyway... Unless Erich is there. At which point it doesn't feel dirty but I generally get really close to a climax but it almost... feels too good to continue. So I stop and the feeling leaves.     This though. This was a different kind of feeling that I couldn't possibly describe.... So I won't try. But I will say it felt wonderful. And I'll be feeling the effects of it for the rest of the day. *smiles*    I've gtg. I hope I'll ttyl later Erich.    Sage     *I've often thought that sex was alot of work and tiring *winks* so that, combined with the fact I was half asleep is where the thought came from
