I haven't slept yet because I have been talking to Michelle all night and I just uploaded my new profile picture because the old one was gay. Anyway, This is the only post I will be making today, Hey wouldn't you know it? Right at the stroke of midnight, but, now I have to catch some z's before I head into work in the morning. That's right, my whole night was ruined and I couldn't go over to Becky's because I probably wouldn't of been to work until 5 at night.  I told Michelle to post something tomorrow, I hope she does.
