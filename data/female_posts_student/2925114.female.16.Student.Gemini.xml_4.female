Anyways I have family down here. Aunt, Uncle, two baby cousins, my entertainment for the next three days.:D absolutley adorble. My aunt did this fortune telling thing. It was with tea leaves.. I'll explain.  1) You pours you some tea, with tea leaves in it. 2) You drink the tea (Imagine that!) 3) When your done the leaves are left in the bottom. 4) You flip the cup over onto the saucer. 5) You turn the cup counter-clockwise 3 times.  6) For the first turn you make, you think of a wish. 7) For the second turn you think of something you hope for. 8) For the third, you think of a dream you have. 9) When you're done all that mumbo-jumbo you flip the cup over and whatever is left in the cup is supposed to form a picture that predicts your future or says something about your life. But you have to tip the cup and let the remaining liquid drop from it, and the more tea that drops out, the more you'll cry over something in the near future.  So from my "reading" we concluded that I was going to have a huge cry in the near future. However, it would pass very quickly. Umm I'm going to receive a piece of mail (whether it be email or a letter) that's related to love. There was a picture of a cabin. (I have a little shack on my property for partying). There were three characters in a circle. My aunt said that these three were my friends aand I. SO I guess it's Me, Meliss, and Adrienne. Which is freaky because she doesn't know anything aboutmy life aat home let alone my circle of friends. And apparently a circle of anything means my wish will come true... YES!!! Umm there was a rabbit which meant that I had a n ememy I should look out for. My aunt said she had a feeling that the enemy was about something in my acting. Hmm I could name a few....there was some other stuff but I'd rather not make that too public for now.. Well that's my fortune not that you care, but hey just telling you.  I went to see Dawn of the Dead recently with my boyfriend. Best movie ever. And by best I mean worst I ever seen! They had to resort to severaal sex scenes to wake up the audience, and apparently there was a Bruce Cambell impersonation... I say apparently because I've never seen the guy before, I think they saaid he was from the Evil Dead movies or something.  Well Happy Easter to all and to all a good night!!  Ness*
