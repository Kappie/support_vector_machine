I know my school is in Harlem, but why'd she have to get all 8-year-old in the ghetto with me, man?!  Example:  Me: Hey that looks good. My brother: Yeah, you want some? Me: Sure, yeah! My brother: Stop beggin'!  BWAHAHAHA  That shit wasn't really that funny then and it ain't that funny now.  I'm depressed.  :-(
