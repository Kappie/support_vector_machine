Surreal art is generally what I like the most- (though not surrealism the art movement per se) art that makes me feel like I'm somewhere else, and particulairly places that are strange and almost seem like they ought not exist.   If you've never seen it, it comes with Crazy Theo's reccomendation. ^_^
