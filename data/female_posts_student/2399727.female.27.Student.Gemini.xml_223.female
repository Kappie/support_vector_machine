I did a lot of work on my dissertation today after my return to Hogtown and so some visits to three libraries are warranted in the days to come.  Also a trip to Dominion, to the ASSU who apparently have final exams from previous years that might be extremely useful, and also I have a very short meeting with my disability advisor to sign a form for OSAP that declares I am permanently disabled.   Two more chapters to read for my next Psych test before I start to study as well.  This is the kind of week I look forward to, one with no major events and that should be fairly gentle.  More to come...
