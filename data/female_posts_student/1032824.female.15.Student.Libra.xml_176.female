This is a song which Avril had written when her Grandfather passed away.  urlLink I am plugging her site  because she's cool, she's pretty, she sings and plays, and her site has all the tracks from her new album which you can listen to for free. On the other hand, that doesn't mean that you cannot buy her album.     Are there any rich, kind souls out there who would like to fulfil my wish - to purchase  urlLink this  kewlies Avril tee-shirt? * Dreams dreamily * I would be the happiest woman in the World if I had it on.     * Does the happy dance *    I sound like an idiot.     I can't wait for Monday.       She died-ed.
