I'm not a great one, but yes, I can still click the shutter button. So, I have created a photoblog so I could store all my awesome pictures and stuffs. Yea, you can find it  urlLink here . O, and there is also a link to it down on the sidebar. Yep, keep scrolling down. It's under "My Photo Blog"  Well, that's really all I have to say for today other than ARTURO WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU!
