Anyways, I hate to say it, but the "Washingtonienne" saga has inspired a journal name change, but for two reasons.  1) "Washingtonienne" sounds really cool and 2) it is *very* important to maintain anonymity in these blog entries!  So anyways, I think that's important to note.  I thought I had enough energy to write about this weekend, but I actually don't, so I'm going to sleep.  I seriously need a nap.  I've slept about 6 hours in the past two days.  I've thoroughly enjoyed my days, regardless, but I cannot stay awake any longer!
