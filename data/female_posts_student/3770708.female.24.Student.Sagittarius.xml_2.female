I have been reading a book on the art of  Alex Ross , and was inspired to create a design in a similar style, based on a super hero developed by my beloved web board. So I found myself in the bathroom, perched atop a plastic stool wearing a swimsuit, a nursing bra, a pair of Supergirl underwear, and a towel tied around my neck, supporting a digital camera on my head. Upon the unfortunate discovery of the photos later in the day, Mike and my mother had the grace and tact to stifle their sniggers before I poked their eyes out with my mechanical pencil. Gavin chose to draw on my new reference with a stump of banana, but as I am now completely out of printer paper, it will have to do anyway.  Michael, the innovative manager that he is, has taken it upon himself to paint the lobby and concession of his theatre. He has organized the funds, rounded up victims to help paint, and today we took a trip to Home Depot in search of paint and supplies. To my amazement, there were beautiful men everywhere, and I had a sudden, powerful urge to pinch bottoms. A genuine God sat in the carpet department, such an amazing example of muscle and chisled classic looks that even Mike was impressed. We weren't sure why such a creature would work at Home Depot when he should so obviously be kicking Brad Pitt out of Troy or posing for comic book characters. I really must work on my home improvement skills. I can think of at least a dozen household projects that need to be done, each requiring a separate visit to the carpet department at Home Depot.   If any bottoms are to be pinched, however, I am lucky to have such a fine one at hand. Mike, having gained an astounding 5 pounds since high school, decided he needed to work out more often. We bought him a new pair of running shoes, a few pairs of new shorts (rather short ones, too, as I saw to it) and off he went. There is hardly a nicer sight in the world than Mike, fresh from his daily run, shining with sweat and muscles quivering, his hair in damp bronze ringlets. He complained that tourists stared at him, as though they had never seen a white person in Hawaii before, and I had to chuckle at his innocence.
