I wouldn't as much if I knew what I was doing but I don't. I want to scan some pictures and put them on here but I can't seem to manage doing it. I can do it if it's on a disk but no scanning it is just to hard for me. I get as far as scanning it and then it won't work. Anyway, these pictures are really good and for me to say that then they can't be half bad. I got some headshots taken for drama last October and the person taking them need character shots for something so I got to wear this awesome dress and pose and stuff. It's fun now looking back on it. Maybe one day I'll be able to put the pictures on here. Doubt it but ya never know.
