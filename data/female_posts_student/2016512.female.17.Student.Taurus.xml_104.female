As well as, bring all my old stuff down to The Holy. Does anyone have a dress i could borrow for GS? *shrug* i'm so unprepared. some how i'll get this all done as well as find entertainment and a page turner for my lil' recital. i'm screwed on that part. i also need to shoot off film and figure out what my "Hopes and Aspirations" are. Anyone got ideas? i need it for the program. ah crap!  sorry this blog was pointless. it was more of a list with explanations. i asked a lot of questions. i hope some of you have answers.
