Therefore, for future reference, if I choose to whine or bitch about how my upper middle class life has led me to the deepest caverns of "emo-ism" and that being white has officially made me oppressed at my black majority school, I will add a disclaimer.  On a quite different note, after the occurance of my senior pictures which will exploit me as a 17 year old "wannabe prostitue" in black and white, I think I will die my hair. And not platinum like I did last time. I am thinking....brown? No black, though. That would throw me into the final pit of disgusting emo/punk kid and I would heave my lunch on myself.  Thank you very much! And, to Omaha folk, don't you fucking miss Cursive at Sokol Aud. on August 16th. Only a bastard rents pay per view while a Cursive show is happening.  ...and yes, I do know that my first two paragraphs were one sentence each, but this isn't fucking english class....
