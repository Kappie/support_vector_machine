The lit review is on hold though- the stuff that I'm doing in my other summer class is going to play into that a LOT, so I'm just waiting a little bit.   Also, I need to take out a lot of the gender stuff. I put that in because my professor last semester told me it was necessary, even though I didn't really want this thing to go in that direction. But for right now I'm leaving it as it is. I'm not sure why... maybe I'm just afraid to take it out.   I still havent' heard back from the school district. I am anxious about this. I really want it to work out.
