When we were washing the walls, Mel grabbed a soapy sponge and smooshed it right in my face, so I smooshed her back, and we ended up having a screaming, sponge-dodging fight. Mel also found it very amusing to paint my legs white, which I just spent 1/2 scrubbing off in the shower. She was also very amused to find me caught in the "owie spot" on more than one painful occasion. When we were cleaning out the brushes we had yet another fight, this time with the hoses, in which Hannah S arrived just in time to catch the last of it. Hannah arrived when we were having our break, and we ate pies and talked together. During which Mel hinted in the most un-subtle way I've ever heard, that Hannah and Pete Hayes should go out. The converstaion went something like this: Mel:  "So when's Pete gonna teach you the drums?"  Hannah:  "Ahhh, it probably won't happen.."  Mel:  "You guys should make a day of it, Pete could teach you the drums, then you could go to the movies together...  (winking from Mel, nervous chuckling from Hannah and hysterical laughter from me :P)  hehehe.  I had to leave at 2:30pm so I didn't get to put the actualy yellow colour on the walls. Mum wanted me to come see Harry Potter with the family. Yes, now I am posting this info in my blog under full awareness that I am probably going to be slaughtered by all the people whom which I have ridiculed and laughed at, while they have defended themselves, about going to see Harry Potter. T2 in particular. :P But neway, the movie was well..... what can i say about the movie? I had heard so many mixed reviews about it that it is probably impossible, under the circumstances, to present a true critique of it. But must I say, the change of director was obvious. The sets were different, but I think I was the only one who noticed. And I found the very unsubtle changes of season pretty corny. And, mi gosh, there is too much sexual tension between 13 yr olds, i mean come on! Apart from that nothing really stood out for me. I would say it was a pretty lukewarm movie. I wouldn't see it again.  But after this was when the torture really began. Mum decided it would be nice to go out for dinner. We ended up going to the eat-in Pizza hut at Warriewood. I can tell you I'm not going to be doing that again with my family any time soon! Firstly, we have to wait in a 15-minute line to get seated, and when we actually do, there is, surprise surprise, a party of little kids running around like lunatics. And my littlest brother, Michael, was being the biggest pain. We had to sit in one of those booth chairs, and of course, I was on the end, so I hardly got to stay in my seat the whole time, i was constantly getting up to let people in and out. They had no pizzas that i liked, they seemed to only want to cook the yuck ones. And my bros were just getitng on my nerves like you wouldn't believe! Only a person with two younger brothers could understand the struggle I was going through not to hurt them. And then, after we had finally left the damn restaurant, we drove home, with Michael once again trying to hurt Callum, and wailing in a high-pitched voice when mum got angry at him. Mum decided to play "Eye Spy" which was  the worst  game she could have possibly chosen for the mood I was in. Michael insisted on starting his turn with "I spy with my big pussy bleeding eye..." aaaahhh, little boys. Let me just tell you I was gald to get home...
