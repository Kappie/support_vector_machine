As I was walking towards campus, a guy came up behind me on a bike and alerted me to watch my left.  As the man passed, I was delighted to see a dignified 20-something year old guy in a business suit riding an El Chuck style bicycle with a huge seat and very widespaced handlebars.  He also had the seat set way too high so he was kind of balancing precariously.  Funny stuff.  Then, on the corner of Huron and Division, a corner I walk by nearly every day, I noticed renovations being done to a building that's been empty since I moved to Ann Arbor.  And what is moving into said building?  A Papa John's Pizza!!!! Yay!  I've been going through good pizza withdrawal for more than a year, and thus I am wicked excited.  I have actually spent a lot of time thinking about how much a PJ franchise could make in a huge college town such as this, and someone else obviously felt the same.  Yay once more!     Other than that my day has totally sucked.  Still no mail for Jamie, and I have SO much reading to do for my Ling class.  Many hundred pages by next Tuesday alone.  So I should probably work on that now.
