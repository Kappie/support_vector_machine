However, I'm incredibly stumped as to why Wolf and Druck's blog links are in purple... if anyone else sees them as different than the other links, lemme know... along with your theory of WHY they're like that.  :-)      Update    Okay... nothing else is really going on today.  Been doing laundry and some cleaning in my room and around the house.  I've also been picking exact colors to paint in my bathroom... I'm doing a faux finish... it should be fun and interesting.  In the meantime, my Dad asked me if I wanted to paint my room something else, and so I've decided that while in the painting and remodeling mood, that I should probably do it now.  So, I've decided on a navy blue for the walls, and for the baseboards and frame work a burgundy color.  Then the woodwork (like the window sills and the closet doors) will be a beige/light khacky color.  I'm also making a duvet for my bedspread instead of buying a completely new one or buying a duvet for like $60-120.  It's going to be navy blue, burgundy, gold and forest green.  I decided to use the primary colors in their darker shades.  My curtains are going to be a sheer burgundy color.  I'm excited to do this, because my room is long overdue for an updated look... and I'm growing quite tired of the blues, greens and lavenders.  My Mom's only concern was that the dark color on the walls would make my room look really small... but for anyone who's seen my room, they would know that's no big concern.  My room is very large.  The size of my parents master bedroom at our old house.  In addition to the painting in my room, we're going to paint in the living/dining room area.  My Dad is tired of patching and repatching cracks in the walls, so he's decided to put up wood paneling in the dining and living rooms.  Well, in the dining room it's really only going to be 3 walls, because the one wall has wallpaper that all of us are quite fond of (it's a beige/maroon/blue plaid).  So, we decided to do the other 3 walls in the dining room beige, and put a medium burgundy... borderline to plum on the living room walls.  Those rooms (since they are really more like one BIG room) are going to have wood floors.  Not only will we be painting this/these rooms... but my Dad said he wants a new color in their bedroom.  He wanted blue, my Mom doesn't.  Then she said she wanted this apricot color, and he turned his nose up at that.  So I have yet to find out what they put in there... but I think they've both sorta agreed on a peachy color.  I pointed out to them that with it on the walls, it's really going to look MUCH different than that.  Not as light, and since neither of them really like a LOT of color, I think it'll be just enough color for them.  Anyhow, I'm really excited, because I love painting.  I don't really like the moving furniture and taking everything off the walls and patching holes part... but, it will be worth it!    Another thing that they're talking about is finishing the clearing out of the patio room and putting a spa/hot tub in there.  We'll see what comes of that... but I wouldn't be all that surprised if the spa/hot tub ends up outside.  I think they may rethink it because they will realize there will always be puddles on the floor next to it in there.  Then maybe I can talk them into the idea I had of putting a pool table in there and making it a game room.  I think that'd be a better use for it... of course, it'd be really cold in there during the winter, because that room has to have its own heater... but still.  :-D  Okay... well, I've talked enough, and I must get back to the laundry and other chores for today.  Comment, comment!
