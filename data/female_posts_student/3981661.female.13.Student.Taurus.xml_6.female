Today I took the names Ichigo and Zakuro on habbo hotel xD Now their MINE forever :D        Yay! I'm gonna see Jazz (my best friend) today :D But first I have to go to the library and go to see my grandpa.^ _ ^       Yesturday I drew some more pictures. I drew Lulu (from final fantasy 10), a chocobo and Eiko (from final fantasy 9). I shaded the picture of Eiko, cause one of my friends said my pictures would look great with shading in it. It was the first time I'd done shading, andI think it doesn't look very good :I Mum says its good. I'll show Jazz later. If it looks rubbish I'll just blame it on Ricky (the friend who said I should shade) xD        I better gooo now. Times a wastin         Looove Zen xxx
