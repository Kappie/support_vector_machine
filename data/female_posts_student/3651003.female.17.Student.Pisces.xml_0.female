Yea...I think that's what is in order. I think I'm gunna get him that Los lonely Boys CD; I'm totally not kidding when I say I can see my dad sitting there singing that! Anyway...Well, since I haven't written it down yet, I might as well...I QUIT SHOGUN! Yes; it is true. But of coarse, before I can say why or say what happened, let me just note for the record: I already got another great job at Los Cucos and I'm getting payed $1.50 more! But, just for the record. (hehe)  Okay, so when I get back I'll write everything that happened the other night. Ciao Bella!
