G-ma was watching it too today, it was thuroughly enjoyable, if at least to laugh at. 3) Aww frickin' W00T you have your license! YE-AH! Today was mine and Abby's 3rd month anniversary, that's why it's special.  Everyone dressing up tomorrow? It's going to be AWESOME! Umm...it's "belt and shoes match", right? I thought that was it. What about the tie, does it matter? I don't think I'll even read this again before you all see me, but I thought I would ask for future reference, or to laugh at myself thereafter.
