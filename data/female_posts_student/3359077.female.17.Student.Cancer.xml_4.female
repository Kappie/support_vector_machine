Last night I only got one thing done. Big surprise. Yah, I just cleaned stalls. Instead of bringing Taffy over to work with her, I brushed out Ben's mane. It took me an hour! He had some major dredlocks going! So now his mane's all nice and pretty and long! It's like over 2 feet! He's so gorgeous, he looks like an Andalusian, but he's pure Arabian.   Tomorrow I'm going to school. Then I'm coming home. Then I'm going to bed. Wow, big day tomorrow, huh?!  I do hope that Mrs. Robbins (my English teacher) gives back the paper she collected on Thursday. She made most of the class redo their papers because she didn't think that they were "A" material. I had to redo mine, although I thought it was wonderful and so did various other people. Oh well, the one I just did should knock her socks off. Yes, it was that good. I happen to be wonderful at BSing.
