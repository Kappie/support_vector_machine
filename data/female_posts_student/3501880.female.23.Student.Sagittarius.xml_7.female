Listening to:  Jay-Z's Hard Knock Life   Watching:  Bridget Jones's Diary   Mood:  I got skillz, yo! ______________________________________  First day of my new job yesterday. Mainly, it went well. It's different than all my previous jobs. Usually, I would spend the first two weeks at a job sitting there, watching someone else do things and then turn around and explain it to me. It would take me months to feel like I actually knew what the fuck was going on.  I don't feel quite this way at my new job. Granted, I have to be told about a lot of things and pointed in the right direction, but I realize that I got skillz. I can be given background information, maybe a few pointers in the right direction, and then I am off.   And yet, I don't trust my skillz. In previous jobs, I had someone breathing over my shoulder, letting me know if I did something right or wrong. In my new job, there really isn't a right or wrong answer. Or at the very least, my boss doesn't necessarily know what it is, and it is my job to find it. This is difficult, because part of me desperately needs the validation of, "you did it correctly" or "no, that was completely incorrect."  Overall, I like the work, and it will be useful, hands-on skills. The work itself isn't bad, it is the lawyers that accompanies it that I hate. I really don't care who is sleeping with who and all that "political" bullshit. But alas, that is why I get paid the big bucks!
