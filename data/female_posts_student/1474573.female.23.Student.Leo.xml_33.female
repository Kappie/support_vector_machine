Once these papers are finished.....I'm all moved in..AND i secure a job that doesn't make me want to hold my bosses and co workers for ransom.....that all will be well in wonderland....I don't mind the debauchery so much when i can manage my success in tangible ways like say......saving money, paying rent....etc. etc.? I guess if i can focus on my writing then it doesn't really matter if I'm an asshole?
