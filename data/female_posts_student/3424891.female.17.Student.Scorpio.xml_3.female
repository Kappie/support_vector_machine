I will miss you and I love you!!! Briana I hope you have fun to! I have officially decided that dead week does NOT exist!! It is full of nothing but presentations, projects, essays and cramming for the finals...does anyone agree? If anyone wants to be able to post email me or Kayla. That's all for now.... Asta!
