It takes a lot to impress me though.   What's today? School starts the 30th of August. That's way too soon. But I just want to get it over with. At least there's winter break to look foward to.   I really don't know what I've been doing all day these days. Watching a lot of movies I guess. My sister rented Cold Mountain the other day and I was watching it yesterday morning but when I had about 20 minutes left my dad had to go and he was going to turn the movie in, so I didn't get to see the last 20 minutes. It was good so far though.   I can't really think of anything else to add... I guess I don't really need to worry about making posts interesting or anything since nobody reads this anyway. Though I saw people have visited my profile. That's neat.     Music: Am I Missing - Dashboard Confessional
