See...If I put a selfish spin on this, I will fool myself into a motive. Ssshhh...Don't tell anyone!  I am looking for a job in Orange County. Preferably in Irvine or in Fullerton. I am moving to be close to my honey Brenden. We are still together, almost 9 months strong now. We were discussing and researching a place together, but unfortunately he will not have the funds to leave the room he is renting while going to school, so I will be doing the same. I will look for a room to rent as well. (www.roommates.com, I recommend it.)  Been running into some people from the past as of late. Men from the past to be more accurate. Some are on good terms, some are total mistakes. I was speaking with my friend Jason, reminiscing and what not. I came to realize no matter what our relationship was before, that we can have a strong friendship now and in the future. One of those things that reminds me I am a grown up. Yeah...Scared the hell out of me.   Weddings...  One of my best friends, Josh, is getting married in June. I don't get to see Josh as often as I would like...Never really. But I could not be more happy for him and Christina. They deserve to be happy. Brenden's older brother Tom is getting married next year and has asked Brenden to be his best man. I think that means I am invited to the wedding...One can hope. Brenden, our friend Tony and I were in Tony's garage a while ago talking about Tom's nuptials. Brenden started giggling...When asked his motivation for the giggle he looked at me and said "Maybe we should make it a double wedding." Tony and I sat him down and explained that jokes like that with a girlfriend like me are not really a good idea.  I am slowly pulling myself from the theatre scene here in the AV. I had to turn down 4 offers to stage manage for the college and a few community groups. Made me sad...My reputation is finally getting around and I will not be around myself to see it. Damn me.  I will attempt to keep my blog up and running this time around. For me...Remember?
