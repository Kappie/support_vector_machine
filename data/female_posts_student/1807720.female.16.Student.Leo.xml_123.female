I guess I shouldn't judge if I did good or bad on it right now, but I am not confident that I did well.  I got confused on a lot of questions, but I studied a lot for that.  It's like I know the information, but when I get to the test something happens.  I don't know what because I can't exactly explain or describe it.  There was lots of reading charts and number things to, and that's just not my thing.  Besides we hardly ever read charts or answer questions on them so it's odd that there would be a lot of that on the test.  I just pray I do good because I deserve it.  I can't deal with doing bad on something that I know for a fact I know very well.  I guess I will just have to wait for tomorrow and see.  We did go Off-Campus for Active Living today.  It was really fun!  We went curling and like at first it was really hard, but by the end of it we were getting a lot better and at the end of the game it was a tie.  Swain and I teamed up against the other girls in Off-Campus.  Drama was really cool today too.  We had a guy that specializes in make-up and costume design come it.  He did a demonstration on Megan which was amazing!  He made it look like she had wrinkles and bruises, and even scars he could do with the make-up.  It was amazing!
