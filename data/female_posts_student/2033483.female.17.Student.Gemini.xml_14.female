This will not disappoint you. We'll start off with the complaining section 1. Study Hall=Study! Enough said if you need it explained to you then you're just like every moron that's in my study hall (no offense Renae) 2. People I don't like...What can I say about them today?   No one did anything particular that annoyed me besides the kids in my study hall. 3.  Didn't see boy capable of melting iceberg today. (tear)  Got a nod from Kurt.  The nod is a cheap way to say "hello" But, oh well, take what you can get, right?  Very uneventful otherwise.   Brett gave me a pamphlets to look at during reading period about democrats and Republicans which was extremely bias on every level because it was made by the Republican party.  So it was all bull shit.  But koodos to Brett for letting me read that.  I like that he gets into it like I do.  Must kids our age could give a rats ass about politics.   Which reminds me of something.  The news always talks about all the bad things kids do, what about the good things?  People think teenagers are so horrible.  WE ARE NOT!  I hate the stereotype that all teenagers are trouble makers.  I'm not!  I work my ass off in school give me a break!  I find it humorous that I can make such a boring day turn into a blog.   For Jessica, Renae and Erica's amusement:  Kurt is sooooo dreamy! haha...It makes me laugh too.  I really don't ever remember saying that but it makes you guys laugh so whatever.   Thanks Sean for listening to my complaining.  Word of advice, start your homework earlier!   ~tata
