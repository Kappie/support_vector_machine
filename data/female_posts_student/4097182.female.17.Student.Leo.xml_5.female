Going at her own pace w/o telling us which page n where she is at lor... I was so damn blur..... There r things to be copied, tt i noe, but problem is i couldn't find where or which line she's at!!! N when i finally found tt line, she move on liao... so in e end i ended up copying nth.... ARGH....    E angriest thing is tt she end e lesson liao then ask whether she need to tell us where she is n where to do wad.... I mean, this kind of thing still need to ask one meh?? of cuz u got to lead ur students along rite?! Otherwise we come to sch for wad????!!!!   Ok... Now let's tok abt yinghan's BELOVED room mate... Anyway, glad to say tt she's FINALLY awake n has given some USEFUL 'gong xian' to e discussion.... I mean, not tt she nv gif anything useful lah, but most of e time, she's messing our aspect n indicators up... She always thinks the other way round.... Haiz... Oso, mr ng finally drove some sense into her, n makes her believe tt things shouldn't be done only when everyone's  present... we've told her time n again tt things wouldn't be done if there's so many of us ard, but she nv listens... well, at least there's some sense drilled into her now!    Oh ya!! mr ng was like saying things should be done by everyone n not pushed to 1person rite? he oso said he only sees 1 person always staying back alone doing pw n wondering where e others r rite?? I have a VERY strong feeling he's toking abt our grp... Dun ask me y, but even yinghan n kim think so too... Anyway, sad to say tt i'm not tt kind of ppl tt'll "por" teachers n ppl n showing them tt i've done this n tt.... i mean this is wad u shld do lor... no need to show off one... doing this kind of biao mian kungfu is not my forte, n i nv accept it... u dun like it, ur problem, tt's e way i am!!
