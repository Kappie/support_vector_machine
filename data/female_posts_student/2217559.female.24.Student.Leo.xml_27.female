So, I woke up this morning about 9, lounged in bed for a bit and then Lisa called me saying, "Where are you girl??" It was actually 10:20AM. Hahaha. I freaked and threw on my uniform and ran upstairs to find tha tno one cared I was in at 10.  What a great feeling. No running to ECI like I used to do. Anyway, I worked until 1ish and then Lisa and I went to Playa Caracol to do some shopping. I was able to log onto AOL instant messenger to talk with ym mom and grandmother. It was really cool. Anyway, I didn't buy anything really - just some vitamin E, toothpaste and a new lipgloss. Lisa shopped like crazy but something about Mexico clothes jsut really turns me off. Besides, the only place I will wear these new clothes is to the crew bar and I am not trying to impress anyone there. Hahaha. Long story short, I was back at the ship by about 3:30 and back at my desk by 4.  I have had a great evening though. Lisa and I have been cracking up left and right about random stuff. We decided to have a "Shell Sister" reunion tonight with our friend Kim in the crew bar. Kim has been working the night shift for about 11 days so she is finally joining the real world again during the daytime. So, I guess we will go there, gossip, drink a few beers and go to bed. Tomorrow is a sea day which means we will all be really busy. I have 3 functions and a formal tomorrow.   Anyway, I hear that the crew gets a huge buffet dinner tomorrow night. It's an international feast where they cook each countries favorite dishes. I can hardly wait to see what they come up with for the US. =Hahah=  Lisa always jokes about me being a "dumb American" but I snap back at her about her "soreys and aboots" as she is Canadian.  We have so much, I swear. Just retarded fun.   Christmas day we are in Acapulco and I am helping out with a wedding -well, actually planning the wedding. Just call me, "Shelly the Wedding Planner."   I hope everyone is enjoying the much needed time off with friends and family. I miss everyone so much but fortunate for me I have made some great friendships on board. We are sharing christmas presents and we have plastic trees in our offices, etc. Not too shabby - definitely not close to being at home but a good try.   Lots of love, Shelly
