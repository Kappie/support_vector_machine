I don't feel like getting into how unhappy I really am, as I don't enjoy blaming my own bitterness on myself... but there's not too many other choices. So instead, I choose to shut up for a long time until maybe I feel better. (I'm going to be shut up for a very long time).  I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.
