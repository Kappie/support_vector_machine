I'ma nut so obviously, I have my own me-sized shell. My dad has a laptop that I use more often than he does so I can just kinda open my shell and bring it in with me anytime I feel like stayin in there for awhile.  I have everything about me posted inside mah little shell so usually I only go into it when I need to disclose personal info about myself.  I'm enough of a nut as it is, I don't need a shell to go with it...so I the shell isn't used too very often...I mean...I like scaring people, but not  that  much...I don't want to scare them completely away...you know...I wanna have SOME friends.  hee hee Ok that's all I haveta say for now. :-P
