Of course, with that comes some pretty intense nostalgia and second guesses about whether or not I really should take that opportunity to move to Cuba for 2 years in August.  It's just...2 years is such a long time, and with Brandi fighting this battle with cancer I need to be closer to my family.  There really wouldn't be that much of a difference between leaving for Cuba in August and waiting until the summer of 2005.  ::sigh:: I don't know.  The  urlLink Witness for Peace  job application isn't due until March, so I still have a month or so to make up my mind about whether or not I'm going to apply.
