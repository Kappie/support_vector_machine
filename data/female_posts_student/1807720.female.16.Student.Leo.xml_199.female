After the Bio final, I will be in grade twelve starting September.  I keep thinking about University more and more these days too.  I am pretty sure I know what I want to do, and I don't think it's going to change.  Getting into University scares me a lot.  I don't think I could handle rejection.  I mean I can barely handle Chem class as it is.  My biggest goals next year is to get into University and get a scholarship - Maybe one of those Habits of Mind Scholarships they give out to grade twelve's.  I have a good shot for that, especially since I am like miss-I-work-my-ass-off-for-ALL-of-my-marks-and-always-put-my-best-effort-forth.  I also thought that my English exam went really well today.  I took my time.  I concentrated.  I focused on what I needed to do.  I made a strategy.  I did the knowledge questions first, and then the reading comprehension.  This build up my confidence cause I thought the knowledge questions were easy, so when I got to the reading comp I was more relaxed.  However, I did get a major headache half way through cause the exam is like way too long.  Like sitting there for hours, just thinking and using your brain to ultimate capacity is hard on moi!  I so totally thank Proulx for helping my with reading comp. cause like after that it totally make me believe in myself and my ability to do well.  I also think that I might not necessarily have any type of learning problem like I thought before.  I think that I just get stressed out for tests and maybe like test anxiety.  I need for time for things and just need to be more alert and aware.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe that's my problem.  Yeah, I also forgot to post this pic.  It is the day of my sisters grad for graduating in the Youth and Child Care Worker program:
