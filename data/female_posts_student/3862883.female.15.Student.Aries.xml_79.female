An axemple is when tony describes how you die from thirst. This allready tells you how durante is going to die.  And at the end the discribtion that tony gives happens to durante in the desert. And the writter doesn't say that he dies. Only discribtion is used.The last sentance of the story is what gives it away that he is dead. The discribtion makes you understand that durante is that.
