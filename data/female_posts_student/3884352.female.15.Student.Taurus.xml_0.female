So i talked to him about it and i was like i just want you to be happy, but i do love you, and i was waiting for the right time to tell you..im so sorry i was just so worried about other things i didn't even notice, and then he started making more sense and was like im sorry i was just wanting to get it out so badly that i was confused about us that it came out wrong..and i just made the worst mistake ever..i still love you, god im stupid...so i forgave him right away cuz i loved him and didnt' wanna let go...so he was like let me just think this out...so i was like yea go ahead hun..cuz i figured he just needed to straighten himself up cuz he was upset..then the next night thinking everything was fine he goes "im confused still" and i was like wait but last night u said it was a mistake and u still loved me....he was like i dunno i was just confused...i mean he was being so unclear! everything just fucking was helpless! and then hes like but i still wanna be friends..and i was like yea thats fine...so i tried being "friends" but he like stopped talking to me and shit...i mean AHHH he was so frustrating..hes like well i thought u were mad at me i was like well yea i was pissed but i don't wanna lose u! we talk like every day for hours, ur what gives me that boost to wake up in the morning...so i still tried making and effort to talk every now and then but its like he doesn't want to..i dunno..and then his away messages are directed towards that girl...like winking smiley faces and shit, he even made point to tell me they were for her..then i found out he got head from her on the 4 of july..im like wow how wonderful not even a week after u break my heart and ur already hitting it wit that girl...and telling my friends about it! just he sent me a letter when we were close teling me how much i meant to him..and he would write me songs, and i always thought i would be the one that broke it off if anything..so thats why it just seems so weird...like i'd like to think he still has feelings for me, but i hate bringing it up or asking cuz its like i push him farther away when i do and i don't wanna lose him even more...but now i mean its like i've lost him so im just trying to find the right words to what i want to say, and i'll do it...i just need the right time..like it looks like hes going out tonight, prolly fuck around wit that girl, so i'll talk to him when he gets home...i mean he told me once that if we weren't so young he'd wanna marry me..and i kno this all sounds like it was just a corny mushy relationship..but if u were in my position and had someone u really cared about saying it to you it'd seem important...and he isn't the type to just throw that out there.  I want to move on but i can't find a guy, im so shy and hate flirting cuz i feel like i'll be rejected...all the guys that like me i don't like back it SUCKS...haha i want ot move on but all i really want is him..even tho he hurt me so much i dunno...and yea i kno people don't usually get lucky on their first love and stuff..and that teens always feel like "oh this is going to last forever" its just the way that it ended that keeps me up at night and thinkign about him all the time...it just never really ended...it was full of i dunno's...god if i was really gorgeous and skinny this would be easy..i could be like yea fuck u too..and go find some hot guy at the mall haha but nope..im like trying ot find a way to hold on to that one jackass that stumbled upon me...i wish i had told how much he meant to me when i have the chance..hmm...o well...i just wish i didn't care so much and i don't want to...but that doesn't change the fact he broke my heart...guys suck haha
