    
       Life is like running barefoot in grass.  It's little things put together that make it feel so good.  Life is like opening a present.  It's the feeling of mystery that makes it so interesting.   Every single journey starts with a single step. Life has its ups and downs.  Your look on life depends on whether you remember happy memories or sad ones.
