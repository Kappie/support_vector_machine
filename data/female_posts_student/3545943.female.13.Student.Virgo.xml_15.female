Did I scare you off darlin'? Was I just to far from what you expected? Is that why you left me, is that why you're gone? Or were you just too blind to understand?  Chorus: I'm waiting for you, all dressed in black. You left me stranded, said you wanted something better. And now you've seen the world and you're turning back. Didn't I warn you? Didn't I tell you? Didn't I show you the way?  Don't think for a moment that I'm grieving 'cuz I lost you. I'm grieving because you lost yourself. You took me for a fool, but now you've seen the light. But maybe now I'm gone for good.  Chorus  I don't know what to do about you. I'm not quite sure how much you changed. When you come back to me, how should I react? Welcome you or push you away?  Chorus  I'm waiting for you, all dressed in black.
