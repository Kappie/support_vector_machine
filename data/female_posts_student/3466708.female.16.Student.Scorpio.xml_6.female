Friday after school I left with my family for Vancouver where we went and stayed at my aunt and uncles place. My uncle and cousin who moved to Norway 3 years ago were also there so that was awesome. I hadn't seen my lil cuz in so long. ^_^  Sat morning we went for a walk..whee fun..heheh..then that night we went to my great aunts memorial service which went quite well.  A lot of people turned out and my uncle that I was staying with gave a speech type o' thing. They actually called it a "family reunion" because it partly was just that. I didnt know half of the people there. So it was pretty cheerful and whatnot. Well, until they showed the whatsitcalled..slideshow on the computer..I can't think of the word >_  So anyways. Sunday we went to White Rock beach and shopped and swam and it was nice.  My weekend was pleasant..nothing too exciting but good all the same.  I like my family lol Good people.  I got home at about 11pm Sunday night which meant I had no time to finish that socials project..then..the next day I forget it at home. I'm just so fucking smart. Aye yi yi..so I'll probably get a shitty mark on it. Fuck you Mr. Annis..grr.  I went and got my courses all done for next year. I have..  Yearbook( I think I'm in it now anyway. Mr. Hutchins is kinda dumb tho so who knows..), English Lit, History, Geography, Writing, Law, English, Career prep, CAPP, umm what else...oh art! So yeah, sounds pretty good to me.  But I'm a let you feckers go now because this is soOo long.  Just gotta mention though..I met a boy. *holds back the girly giggling* It's a LONG distance relationship..but I think we can make it work. I sure hope so anyway. ^_^
