My grandfather passed away today and we're getting ready to head up to Connecticut for the funeral...pending we don't get caught in the 2-7 inches of snow they're expecting overnight.  We're all handling things realatively well, considering the circumstances.  I won't put the details in here, suffice to say that it was not a pleasant way to go...  Other than that, the end of the semester is proving more hectic than usual.  Any thoughts and prayers offered would be much appreciated at this point.  ~Dan~
