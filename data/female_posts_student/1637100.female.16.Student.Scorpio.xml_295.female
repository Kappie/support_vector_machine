You are quite distant from emotion and people, but you have been made this way by one thing or another. Your are truly unique yet fail to see it, and are quite creative be it in art, music, writing, etc.. You used to let people in now you don't even bother to try having been hurt so many times in the past. Your attitude is that you don't need anyone but yourself, people are just trouble waiting to happen. But you really do want to trust someone no matter if you see it or not, deep down your waiting for someone to come and set you free. This kind of depression can turn dangerous, don't let them get to you. Not everyone in the world will hurt you, humans are humans and are not perfect. So most likely sooner or later you'll meet someone who feels like you do and perhaps your shell will eventually disappear.    urlLink   .:-|What is your true element?|-:. -With Anime Pictures and detailed answers-     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       interpretive    urlLink   *~  What kind of dreamer are you?  ~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       You Are a Werewolf    urlLink   A Quiz for the Odd and Extravagant: What Dark Ethereal being Would You Be?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    that was fun. yay!
