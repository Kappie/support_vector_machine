Plus I got out of the house and occupied my mind a little...  I was talking to Jorge earlier and I said something about 'my ex' and I didn't even realize it until I went back and read what I'd written.  That was kinda weird, and it kinda made me cry a little b/c the word 'ex' has such a negative connotation and it doesn't feel entirely appropriate for me to use it in this situation...  Idk...  I have to clean up my room tonight, and fold my laundry...  Mom bought me some new clothes yesterday, a new purse, new flip flops, plus a charm bracelet.  One of those add-a-link things.  There's a Happy Bunny charm at Claire's that I want to get for it once I get more money.  They had these cute little stuffed green and purple frogs at Kohls too, I want to get one of those too, they were soft and cuddly.  So were the little hedgehogs.  And I saw Nicole Petroff.  I didn't realize that she still worked there...  But yeah, that's been the small amount of 'Bright Side' to my entire weekend...  Hopefully tomorrow is decent.  Play practice is going to suck b/c I can't really talk above a normal tone... stupid sore throat.  Mom was going to take me to Urgent Care, but what will they do?  Tell me my throat hurts, give me some pain pills, and tell me to go home.  Come back if it's not gone in a week.  So why don't I just wait and go in a week if I still have it?  I'll just keep taking ibuprofen...  ARGH.  Life sucks.  Hardcore.
