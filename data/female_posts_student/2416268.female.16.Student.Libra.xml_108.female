Take last night for example, I was fucking knackard but I didnt fall asleep until about 3.30 am, then I woke up at 8! It has been going like this for some weeks now....what the fuck is wrong with me? I guess it has become a pattern, a pattern that is difficult to break, but why did it start in the first place?  Oh yes I remember the last time this happened to me........hmmm I think I know the cause.....but what can I do? I mean if I stop doing what I am doing to make it this way, then I will be putting weight on, as it is I am not losing nearly enough!!!!!!  :-(  oh just ignore me, I am saying things I shouldnt be, as usual, I am going now  XxX
