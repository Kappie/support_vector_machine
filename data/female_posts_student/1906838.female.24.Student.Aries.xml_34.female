I dont trust any stethoscope other than the Littmann made ones.. and if i cant find mine by wednesday, i guess id just have to ask my senior (doctor) friends if i could have a loan of their's for two hours on thursday morning.  This morning i practiced ALS and other osce stuff again with dheeba and zakiah. DHEEBA. it has been a while since i last met and talked to her. We used to be flatmates in the villas,and could spend hours just talking. I must say this morn's session was rather fun actually. i am not saying i am more competent at my examination techniques, but now i think after a whole year of clinical experience, i have slightly more confidence than i did the last two years. Confidence is important when you are doing medicine. If you as a clinician is not confident of yourself, how could u expect the patient under your care to feel confident of you?   Hahaha.. i was also told today of one person in our class.. one person whom i used to think of being quite keen and clever. Apparently, that person , asked the consultant ( most likely the urologist) during their teaching sessions ... , 'So.. prostate cancer IS more common in men than in women?'. err.. hello. I know i am not particularly bright myself ( having been caught by my GP tutor of not knowing the anatomical position of the human appendix .. hehe i was put on the spot!)but d-uh.. PROSTATE CANCER IN THE FEMALE SPECIES. now THAT'S  a scary thought !!!!!! hehehehe   eheheh... my blog entry today will not be complete if i didnt talk about golliwog. my dear sweet old golliwog. we talked for over 2 hours last night ..him keeping me updated on the progress of the euro finals at the same time. I realise that , yes i am stupid .. having gone thru' such a traumatic relationship the last .. yet i am willing to risk another heart ache with this one. But as i pointed it out to him last nite. This is different. Hahaha.. probably becos i am his best friend rather than his girlfriend makes it easier for him to tell me things that he probably wouldnt tell me if i were his gf anyways. I told him last nite that i am ever thankful for his presence because this year has been , undeniably , one of the more happier ones of my four years in DUNDEE. Fate is funny. My relationship with golliwog is one which i think is the funniest ( funny strange not funny ha-ha) act of fate ever. Which initially made me think we were MEANT to be together .. but obviously not. But again, theres a reason for everything ... and there is a reason why our relationship will never be perpetuated.   argh, that sounded so damn soppy. oklah.   FOURTH YEAR EXAMS .. HERE I COME !!!!!!!!!
