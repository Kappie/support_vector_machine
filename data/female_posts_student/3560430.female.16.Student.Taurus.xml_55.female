I didn't know that they had been deactivated! But apparently since my teeth move so quickly the springs had moved the teth as far as they could, that is without the 'crimps'. Grumble. I don't like this. Grump grump grump.  I'm going to read my book for the rest of the day. Maybe I'll finish it. Unlikely but it could happen. All I really want right now though is popcorn. I'm holding out until my paretns go to work. Or maybe not. I don't know. I do need to edit... I keep saying that and most of the time I do but there  is the occasion where I'm either to busy to do so or too lazy. Maybe I'll play an internet game first. Wow way to print out randome thoughts. My mom tried some pressure points on me the other day to help my carple tunnel but, well it made it worse. Either she's not good at it or I am a freak of nature. I'm going to go with the second option. Unless we are talking about carple tunnel I don't feel very much pain in  my wrists, even when doing wrist locks in class and those bring even my father to his knees. So I'm going to stick with I'm a freak.
