In Oral Interpretation we did some congress debate while there was a sub. Chem we looked at elements and how they look when they explode. O ha and in chem Mark Ortega got escorted outta the room by none other than our friendly security, Tony. Don't know what he did, but he won't tell anyone. Spanish I took a test, and did hw...from other classes. P.E. I taught Jessika and Natalie all of our dance, we're getting pretty good. At lunch I bought the whole cafeteria so Alissa, Lindsey, Jen, and I could eat. Sociology I took notes while Dillon Rhosdahl was falling asleep. And in Geometry we had a fire drill, took a quiz, and talked. After school I went to tutor, almost falling asleep on her, but now, here I am talking to you people. But anyways last night I was talking with Brandon as usual and he tells me that he's going to be joining the wrestling team to keep in shape for football. Now, for those of you who don't know much about wrestling, guys have to wear spandex one-piece-jumpers. Wow is this going to be fun or what?! Now this means that he's going to be gone after school at practice ): More time for me to sit here and think about him, waiting for him to call around 6. But, sometimes I can go see him at his meets and kick ass so it's all good! Today I experienced a sad notation, Jessika Spiteri does not have any clue who Tupac is. Now, seriously, how could someone not know about Tupac? He's one of the best, and if even THE best rapper who ever lived. Well, this shows you people how sad living in Danville can be. Now, don't get me wrong, I LUV Danville, it's just that sometimes it gets to be too big of a bubble. So anyways I better start my chem hw...yea that's right, chemistry in the 9th grade, crazy huh? My mom doesn't think so, so of course I can't think so either. But, it's not that hard, I mean I have Shotwell. Anyone with Shotwell should have no lower that a C; do your hw, if even, and you're set. Yea, so I'll be writing back soon...maybe in an hour.
