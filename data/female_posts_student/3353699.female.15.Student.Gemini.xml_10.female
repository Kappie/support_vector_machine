And i sorta did a mini makeover one my room. i took down some stuff cleared off my desk, put up a mear and decorated my desk a little with a candle. it looks Trés cool if ya ask me (ive always wanted to say Trés cool and i think i used that right, right?) yeah but it looks cool and the candle makes my room smell really good. now i just have stuff piled on my bed. yeah so ive gotta find a place for all of that. and i still have to do more stuff in my room cuz i still don't like everything about it. here ill describe it a bit so you can get the vibe. first off the basics. it has 4 walls and a ceiling. the walls are like a light forest/ mint green (leftover from my obsession with green when i was like 10)(i still like it but want a change) ok the ceiling is white but i have glow-in-the-dark stars all over it (constellation leo too!) hmm what else my bed is at a diagonal angle from the corner farthest from the door. it has black cover w/leopard print on the other side and leopard print pillows (leftover from my jungle obsession (i still like that too though)) umm oh yeah i have a maroon canopy/mosquito net thing (you know those things right?) i have a black and white clash poster, a green Me First and the GG's poster, a red MXPX poster and a black and white/yellow NOFX poster placed strategically on one of the walls. umm my closet is white with a bunch of pictures and paintings stuff on it. (ha im boring you aren't i?? well sorry but i have to finish describing it now that i've started.) ok i have a big window on the other side, a oval mirror next to it with my desk underneath (a tan desk with a white sheet on top of it with a black stripe in the back and a glass vase with a candle in it right below the mirror.) on the last wall i have a calendar, my lttl white board thing, and a hanging thing with all my CD cases and books in it. oh yeah and then on the back of my door i have a bunch of pics too. oh yeah and finally, strung diagonally across the top of my room i have pictures that ive taken hanging up on a string like in a dark room. yeah that's pretty much it. try and picture it. maybe ill post a pic of it when it's clean. and then you can see if your mental picture was right. happy mental picturing!!! -drea ps hope everyone had a good school year!!!
