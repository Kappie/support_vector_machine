We put green flavouring in and swizzed it in a liquidizer! Mmm...different!  What you need to make a gross drink!  A pack of straw berries (the things you get in fruit and veg shops...in England this is) Two bananas Horrible tinned pinapple chunks (can't remember spelling) Bit of lemon Lots of orange! Horrible pint of horrible low fat yogurt...go on, use cream ;) Lots of ice...LOTS! Green food colouring  What you do: Throw in all the fruit (remove skins and other horribly nobbly bits) Wizz it a bit, but if you've got Laura with you she'll make you pulse it to nothing. Add in the yogurt and ice. Smush it to oblivion. Add Green food colouring Watch it go brown Smell it Taste it and throw up! (Enjoy)
