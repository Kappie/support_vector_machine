no smiles explained,
just looks that I cannot fathom.
He glances at me with his big blue eyes,
there's a message behind them
but he never tries.
I hate him, I want him, 
somehow he might feel the same
I'll never shed a tear for him
but often I weep with shame.
How can I blame him for being a boy,
When It's with my own fears and actions
that my feelings toy.
