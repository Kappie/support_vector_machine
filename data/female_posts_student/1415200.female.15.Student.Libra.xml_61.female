(Plus, I dont actually have bad news, other than my life.)  Good Shiz: I get my permit in a month. Which is awesome! Yeah, cuz today is the 20th and my bday is October 20th. (keep that in mind) So next month is my 15 and a half cele! w00t!  Bad Shizncking Shiz: Nothing has really changed with me so far. Other than the fact I don't like a certian person that will remain unmentioned, because of the fact, I am not "outgoing" and I am a quiet person. *cough* So I'm just calling it quits on that little project. Well, last night at the mall with the guys, (Bob/Dan/Harry/Chris/Joe-ish Tonight's gonna be fun too! Were all heading over to Bob's house (same people) and watching a few good movies! Yay! I dunno when i'll be home, Im not heading over there until 5:30-ishel. It will be another late night event! But thats okies, because I don't have track in the morining. That is awesome. I def. need a day off. But I think they are comming over tomarrow. That will be cool too. I have so much fun when I am around them. Oh well. I gotta go. Im leaving in a little, have ppl to talk ta yets. I'll write later.
