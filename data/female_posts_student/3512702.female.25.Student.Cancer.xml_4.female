My kids b day party is approaching and It should be fun The theme is Barbie! hey! shes a toddler! The day after Fathers Day I am attending a Prince concert:) I cant wait. Ive been to one concert at age 12 and one at age 16 but this..this is different. I have been a fan of Prince since I can remember. Back when I was little around 7 or 8 my aunt and mother listened to him. I was hooked along with all the funk and cool music they listened to...."no parkin' baby..no parkin' on the dance floor:P" Anyhow..I should have a BLAST that night!! I think after that my summer will be pretty dull. My b day is soon but who cares about that.
