Real nice and light to wear. i have since changed my opinion of wearing a saree....it aint thaat bad I have to say. I think the food stalls made some money...and the talentime was just fine....vin sang my favourite song. His voice is real nice you know. I was mesmerized...oh yaaa...i forgot to mention...i wore heels yesterday...kinda high larr...summore I am tall :) initially I wasn’t able to get used to the height.....suddenly the eye level in which i saw everything was different....so weird..had to hold on to ash when I walked...and this gabe saw me holding on to him at the ramp..ayioh...I no need to say...I think he start to speculate. oh well...that is sooooo like him. Haha..  I didn’t pack my bag that day..and I forgot to bring my PW stuff…and to think I scheduled a meeting on sat..everyone was probably verry pissed with me..my secretary’s boyfren was also there. I felt real bad. I made them wait..and end up, I didn’t have the stuff. Still feel bad. Has happened a few times. I guess I have to be more careful. I have to get the report done by the end of today..and I have A math today. Didn’t practice. Haven’t done a single question in the ten year series. I better buck up. I know that. Seem to have very little time. All my tutorials are piled up. So tired larrr. All I am doing these days is complain complain and complain. I seem to be missing something in my life....I think it’s the music. Whenever I am sick of werk, me go to the piano...and play a few notes. I feel better. Rejuvenated. Can carry on. Sigh. Am waiting. The month better end soon. Otherwise, I am gonna suffer from depression soon.  Mum was nice to me yesterday and today. Something that’s not the norm….i guess I haven’t been arguing with her. No energy to do so anyway.  Slept late last night...was online..only shashi and my sayang online. Sayang left....only shashi was online in my contact list...tok tok tok...then....go to sleeep. Btw, sorry yar shashi..me was having headache....guess I bored you on the phone..and wasted your money..  slept at near to one....still sleepy.  What happened to the song in my blog?? Not werking!!! I want it back!!!  I suppose that’s all I have to blabber for today…  Bubbye now.
