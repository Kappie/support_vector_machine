Does the male species also stay true to the creato of friends first?  Is it selfish to think about yourself first, even if it is the first time in a long time?   Alright, I guess what I'm getting at is that I like this guy, a lot, but there is also a very good possibility that my friend also likes him... Well, she more has a crush on him, but none the less.  Should I be concidering her feelings over my own?   I feel like everytime I get something good in my life I have to give it up for one friend or another.  Why do I do this to myself?  Am I incapable of looking out for my own best interests?  Why do I care about other people more than I care about myself? I really like this guy and I would love to go out with him, but I can't.  I can't because I'm to scared to hurt my friend's feelings.  I'm to scared to even tell her that I like him... That's not going behind her back is it?  I haven't acted on my feelings, thus no harm done, right?  Please help me... I just don't know what to do.
