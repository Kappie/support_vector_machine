I feel very blessed that my friends are thinking about me by putting stuff in their blogs(renee and franny)and sending me e-mails(ryan in buffalo) and sending me cards(deidra and ryan)and calling me (Courtney and Justin)! I got some more cd's including Something Corperate....i really like their cd...i remember seeing them in orlando with yc. Mom and dad got me a Sugarcult cd and a Linkin Park cd. Both which are excellent. Ok well i dont have any special b-day plans today so if anyone wants to call to say hey go ahead. Later Dayz *hehe*
