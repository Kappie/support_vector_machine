However, for me, it was Spike's character coupled with the acting talents of James Marsters that made me watch the show in the first place.  I heard of Buffy a long time ago, when it first showed.  I thought it was a lame show [and also scary] judging just by the name.  I never even saw the commercials.  Recently though, I was bored and turned on the tv to find Buffy showing.  "Fine then," I thought "Let's see what this show is like."  It [Beneath You, 7.02] opened with a punk girl sporting hot pink hair running around.  "Boring."   I went to get lunch and ignored the tv.  After a long while, I came back bored and watched the scene in the bar with the Anya questioning.  Finally there were some jokes.  And that Nancy girl saying "Is there anyone here that *hasn't* slept together?"  I'm ashamed to admit that caught my curiosity strings very tightly.  Anyway, after all the weird "How did you do it?" "I can see you" stuff, was that blue church scene.  I had absolutely no idea what was going on.  I had only caught that Spike and Buffy had been together 'briefly' and it was 'never serious'.  However, the church scene showed me [though I did not understand most of what was being said] that there was something really deep here.  It moved me.  And I still had no real idea what 'Buffy' was about.  This scene made me check out the Buffy website, and then watch the whole of the next episode [Same Time, Same Place 7.03].  I then found BuffyWorld [above] and reread the script to that episode.  It was so cleverly written, the basement scene with Spike talking to both Willow and Buffy  Xander while they could not see each other.  This made me want to find out about all the past shows and I realized what I had missed out on.  I've read most of the shows now [transcripts on BuffyWorld], but I wish I could watch them.  My tv's also been busted [it's more than a decade old], so the only episodes I've watched so far are:  - Beneath You [partially] - Same Time, Same Place [twice] - Help - Selfless [missed prologue bit]  I hate myself for not watching it earlier.   As I sort of said earlier, my favourite character by far is Spike.  Truth be told, he is without a doubt the 'best' character on the show.  He is supposed to be soulless, and therefore purely evil.  However, he is not.  Yes, at the beginning he is evil, and later he is forcibly 'neutered', then he obsesses with Buffy and only does good for the sake of rating high in the Slayer's books.  But eventually, his love for Buffy [he is not even supposed to be capable of love, according to the story] becomes so great that it could even be called 'agape' [unconditional].  This soulless vampire is less evil than many souled beings on earth.  Out of his own choice.  That's why Spike is an amazing character. There are many out there who whine about losing their 'bad-ass' Spike who was cool and punk.  Personally, I do not like 'cool and punk' people.  But people who are 'cool, punk and evil' yet reform and change into a good person out of their own accord are the strongest people in the world, and most valuable in their efforts.  It is also very touching how this 'rebellious' attitude was brought out because of rejection from society.  It's cute and fitting how before he was a geek and a polite and shy, well mannered man.  I do not like Spike because of the 'bad boy'ness, but because the William inside was strong enough to overcome the evil part of him and become good.  His smartass behaviour only makes him cuter because we as the audience know why he does that.  He doesn't want to be humiliated anymore; he wants to be the one laughing and not the one being laughed at.   Everything  about his character makes me like it.  Except for the punkness.  But it does play a part to bring about the reasons I like him for, I guess.  I absolutely abhor nail polish though.  Even on females.  So... it's one part of him I will never get over.  Apart from that, I can even stand his passion for punk rock, and that's saying something.  =S
