I wish I could trivialize my heartache, but I can't. I wish I could put it into the big picture perspective, but I can't. I fell in love with someone who just couldn't be honest with me, and my heart is broken. He picked someone over me, one of my worst fears. And I don't forgive that. I can't, not after dating J all those many years ago. I called his/my friend R today, and it was good to talk to him. He said he thinks M cared about me more than he cares about this girl Allison, but M just needed to get out of our relationship. I don't know why...I guess maybe he cared too much for his own good and he knew it would never work, I don't know...I know it was never going to work out b/c of the Jewish thing, but I didn't want it to end this way and I didn't want it to end now...I had sex last night, but it shouldn't have happened. It was not good timing, I care about the guy but I'm not ready for this again...but it's not even the sex that has me all in a tizzy. It's the fact that being with anyone new at all just isn't what I want right now. I'm so glad it's spring break. I need this week to heal and be alone or surrounded by people who care about me a lot...God, I wish I could articulate what I'm feeling better, but my pain is just too deep right now. I am going to get ready to eat more sushi...ah...I miss you, Fluffy. I wish you hadn't done what you did :(
