Now, i have no idea why, but i think she did it because she thought my mom was aiming to run her down. hmm, imagine that- getting hit while walking in the middle of the street...it's unheard of, i tell you! simply out of the ordinary (that was sarcasm).  People like that aren't uncommon here in Portand. the Portland community are a very eclectic people. sometimes i think we're a Seattle Jr.  If Portland was a little more festive and flamboyantly gay, we would be San Francisco.  When they aren't drunk, the delirious hobos are uproarious- simply hilarious!
