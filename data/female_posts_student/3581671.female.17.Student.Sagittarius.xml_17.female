I think I will name them    "The Day I Single-Handedly Ruined My Hair"  the title may give a hint of what has happened. Well...about a year ago I asked (forced) my sister to put highlights in my hair. Disaster. I went to a salon to get it all colored one color and that was the end of the problem. Until a year later when the color had grown out, I was two-toned and hadn't gotten my hair cut in a year. Yesterday I decided to get my hair colored a deep brown. It looked nice, but I wanted some flair. So I made an appt. to get professionally done highlights. They looked okay but my and the ends of my hair it looked a little wierd (bad). So I found a picture of a totally cute cut that would cut out the bad parts of the hightlights. So I took that picture to "Great Clips" and asked the woman to cut my hair like that. She agreed it was cute; five inches shorter. So as I drove home wiping the tears from my eyes, nose, chin, etc... I thought of ways to burn down "Not so Great Clips". The one thought that I keep telling myself: hair grows. So please excuse me while a go and try and make myself look as much unlike a skunk that stuck its finger in a socket. Hope everyone is having a great summer!!   katie
