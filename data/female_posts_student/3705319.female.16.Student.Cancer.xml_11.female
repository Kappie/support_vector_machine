Saturday - went to District 6 Museum and then on to Cape Point. very windy but beautiful sites. some of the more adventurous ones (everyone except Katy, Susie, Rachel and Gemma) walked a little further to the new lighthouse built on the side of the coast. by passed Boulders Beach where we saw lots of penguins and then headed on home! Sunday - went to Khayelitsha church in the morning and in the afternoon we planned lessons for the coming week! in the evening we went to the Vineyard 'Breathe' service - the first thereof! it was pretty much the same as our usual Sunday nite praise service. was refreshing to have an english spoken service and it was wat the whole team needed. Monday - national womens day over here! went shopping and then went haggling/bartering in the market! Tuesday - weather is great (even sum of us in shorts). hopefully will get back to u tomorow about the rest of our day! team are working well together and all is good!!  Prayer points:-  1. Team health - lots of us getting colds due to cold and wet weather. 2. Jeffrey the pastor and situation wit khayelitsha church - not sure wats happening here but please pray cos God Knows. 3. The school, teachers, children and 'camp'! 4. Continuation of good weather - 15 000 people made homeless at weekend due to floods in townships. 5. General team morale!!
