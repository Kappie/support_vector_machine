Smith. what kind of name is Smith anyway? have some individuality! some identity! eh...lets hope he knows who he is... unlike mr. whats his name in our english book. poor guy. i feel bad for people who are confused as to who they are. but i guess we are all wondering that to some extent....especially teenagers. this is when were really finding out who we are, right? sure... i think i know who i am for the most part. except for the parts of me that i have not yet had much experience with. if i can say that and not sound like i have another meaning or am crazy. I know whats important to me though. And...ive thought about the whole "what is a person?" thing...how the hell do you define a person? what am i? not "omg, i dont understand who i am!" but...more like...how does one go about defining himself anyway... and i decided on my own fairly suitable answer and im working towards it and all that good thinking crap. i think a lot. about real kinds of things. like that. perhaps i think too much. thats why i worry too much. cause i dont like to ignore my problems. they bother me. make me feel guilty. i hate feeling guilty. its one of the worst feelings. but by far one of the worst feelings ever [bitterness alert] is when you want something with all your heart and soul and you see no cosmic reason why you should be denied of it (no "maybe i deserve to not get this...." kinds of thoughts)...and you know that nothing but good- and when i say that i mean... you will come out a better person, a more devout (if were talking God) person, a more whole person, a more moral person... and you will be doing something to better the world (either on a large scale or a small scale)- and youre working towards getting that... and youre doing everything you can think of, everything you can physically do, everything you understand that you must do...trying to acheive this... get this thing you want so badly... and you keep hitting walls... where fate...where..."the way things have to be"...where the world gets in the way. and these walls are preventing you from getting what you want, and try as you can, with all your heart and soul...you cant come up with good ways around them. so youre stuck. willing to do whatever you can, trying, still, to come up with any solutions youve got....as to how to get what you want... but nothing works and you just feel helpless...and you refuse to believe theres nothing you can do to work towards getting it...because you dont understand why it should ever be that you dont deserve to have it. you dont understand what cosmic, right, just reason tehre is that you should die without ever having it. (as i said befcore, nothing but good will come of this. if anything, the cosmos should be helping you get it) so you think there has to be a way. there has to be some way. somet thing you can do. and youve just got nothing. and you wont let yourself give up because its so important to you, and becaus eyou know youll regret it if you do. now, that...that is a horrible feeling. when youre trying your hardest for something you want so badly and for something that for no reason should be kept from you...and your hardest, your best effort...just isnt cutting it. that hurts. i had a question iw as asking people a long time ago which was "if you try your hardest at something, can you still fail?"...and i meant this kind of thing. and...i dunno...i guess you shouldnt fail. you dont deserve to fail. but do you ever fail? can you fail? i dont know. physically, i guess... and thats sad. but you never really fail in that true failure would be when you stop trying. something like that. anyway. rant over. as usual, moral of the story: lack of contact with emily sucks.  i like our Danton movie. dont know why. barely understand it.  get to take the spanish final tomorrow. heard its easy. got a 100% on my asessment alternativo or whatever. so no worries.  chem on friday though... and i dont know chem so well. mmm... ill bum some facts for my card off of emily and heather and kelly and lauren at lunch. methinks.  and euro! God, i think im gonna fail euro... the final... and this dbq business...and the french rev i really need to review cause im confused now because of this movie... and... ap exam in may...yikes. crazy crazy crazy euro. it will be the death of me.  no, what will actually be the death of me is too little emily. but for now, those things are good, and i will spare you the bitter comments*. because i sit next to her in english! score! woooooot! huzzah.  though she should get online more...id be really pissed if i didnt sit next to her in enlish...which is probably why i sit next to her in english...just to give me the little contact i need to keep from going crazy. far be it for fate to give me that and some occasional aim-ige. no, thatd be too nice. [bitterness altert] we dont want to spoil amanda, now do we? stupid fate. i hate you.  but im okay. english is nice. i am thankful. thankful that she changed our seats again. thankful that perhaps the higher power does care about my mental/emotional sanity. i could never deside if lack of emily craziness was a mental insanity or an emotional insanity. youd think itd be emotional...but then that affects the mental part. but it seems too cold to say its only mental... because i dont feel with my brain, now do i? i refuse to give too much credit to the brain for love. and all subsequent feelings and emotions. it comes from the heart man. the heart and soul. not the goddam brain. the brain is for thinking. thinking and feeling are completely different. though sometimes you can think and feel the same thing.  haha. want to hear my metaphor for euro? (screenames omitted for security reasons)  Michele:  euro is a combination of horrid and wonderful Me: yeah Me: like chocolate cake with a layer of monkey feces Michele: so totally true Me: and you dont get any silverware Me: and the plates they give you are really flimsy paper ones Michele: hehe Michele: so totally true Me: and they give you a huge thing of it and tell you you cant leave till you eat it all Me: even the feces Me: and then youre just locked in a room  Michele: it's a wealth of info covered by a random teacher... Me: with no silverware Me: and flimsy paper plates Me: and chocolate cake Me: and ape excrement Michele: ok ur done Me: and some sadistic officer of cake-eating Michele: lol Me: possibly a chair or table of some sort Michele: lol Me: but if there was a chair or a table...it would be for the cake or the officer of cake-eating. not for you. you wouldnt get one. Me: also there would be no ceiling Me: only cold air Michele: amanda. Me: so youd be like "oh great... Me: " Me: but then there would still be cake Michele: ur imagination is running away with u. Me: well the original cake with monkey feces just didnt have enough evil in it Me: i had to add some  haha. im so funny.  oh, so, i was at the party store Monday cause my mom wanted to stop after i was done at the dentist and get some stuff for some party shes having later this week... and i saw all the cute little valentines and im wondeirng 'so what will i do for valentines day this year?' because i totally slacked off on Christmas. and the only person i've gotten anything real for birthdays is emily... well... i suppose that is expected, right? so i can get away with the birthday thing. unless i get invited to parties of course, in which case there will be present buying. but anyway. i decided i want to give my friends valentines but i missed the ordering from the cool valentines cataloge cause my mom did that last week and i was busy and she asked me but i said "ill do it later" and never did so now i cant do that... so my options are to make valentines or print them or buy some. the ones you buy at the grocery store suck. (oh, or i could just give candy...which i did last year. not a bad option...but since im making up for Vhristmas here...) and when i think of making my own i think doiles and rubber stamps and elmers glue. *shudder* but then i realized i could combine my affinity for making crude stick-like drawings in crayon or water colors with valentines day! ha-ho-haha! (victorious laugh) so think ill make little heart valentines on note-book paper and draw pictures and make up stupid sayings or poetry or whatever and sign my name and each will be special and theyll be awesome. so. totally. awesome.  eee. fun funess for me. i excite.   why am i in such a good mood? i have homework to do... and a final to take tomorrow.   must be the emily in english. maybe this will be a good 6 weeks.   ooh, and then we get to pick our seats after that... so.... perhaps a whole semester of emily? dare i hope? *crosses fingers*  mmm, i should stop crossing my fingers though. that doesnt seem to work. like my prayer box. [bitterness alert] no good prayerbox.    though then am i any better than those people who insist certain gestures or objects are lucky just cause they did them once before a test or something and then they got 100? following that logic, if i sleep 1 hour every night... i should always ace every test! ha... or not. stupid people and their luck. *glances guilty at ankle* well...its not like thats really lucky anyway. its more of a symbol of my crazy deditation. cause im crazy dedicated to things i believe in/for/am passionate about. stuff like that.  wow, needs to dos my homework now. night.  its increidbly thereputic to rant about my day on my blog though. and although some people are always like "why do i have a blog, no one wants to read about my boring life..." A. my life isnt  that  boring. therse all the crazy emily drama. thats kind of interesting...no? sometimes i rant about real things. things that dont just pertain to my life. sometimes i have comedic value. and B. screw you people. i keep this for me. not to entertain. because im too lazy for a diary. ive tried. though this does lack that privacy...eh...oh well. as long as not too many people read this. which i dont think they do. anyway. for me. so i can rant and vent and denounce and endorse and...thank. and...condemn. i guess condemn is like denounce. well, anyway. sorry that this is mostly complaining. there are some good things though.  maybe every time i post...that same day i should make sure i post a positive comment. doenst have to be related...just so im saying something positiv eeach day.   wow, now i really am sounding crazy. time for work.  lets see if i can do this math...  *haha, a whole big long post with only 3! one was pretty big though... but at least i tried to make it a little general. eh.
