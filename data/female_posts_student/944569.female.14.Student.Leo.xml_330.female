Who the hell told evry1 i was crying at the bar mitzvah?  Who?  Someone must have seen me.  -.-' I dont know how i'm supposed to act like you all but i'm trying.  Trying.  Trying.  Failing. Mebbe it's my vocabulary...Let's try acting like David instead... CRAZY MOFOS!  What the hell?  Why do call me fruitcake?  Do you even know what fruitcake means?  Chris is a Jabrownie... No, that didnt work... How about Jenny? CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE!  MOUSIE MOUSIE MOUSIE!  *sucks fingers* I'm Molasses! No...i shouldnt try to impersonate anyone.  These are terrible impersinations...
