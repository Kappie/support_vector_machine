I mean everywhere people would be doing stuff for others, I know of people who would have to give blood, my father would have to buy me a VW Beetle and so forth. I mean...is anyone out there willing to sell their soul to the devil to get him to freeze hell over? I really want a Beetle. Just think the devil sitting there with chapped lips and rosy cheeks. Strange, I know. But, how cool would it be if hell froze over? No pun intended. Pondering.
