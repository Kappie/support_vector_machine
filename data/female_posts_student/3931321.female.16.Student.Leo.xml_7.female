I actually kept thinking that today (Friday) was either Wednesday or Tues.. until I looked to see what was using the shows that were comming on.. yeha.. I do watch too much television.   Last night   (I think it was last night..   ya it WAS last night!!  )We (myself. Carolyn. Jemma and Vanessa)  all went to Carolyn's sisters house and watched tv.... did some other stuff... and did not go to sleep till about 5?  Then I came home and went to bed. Did not wake up till about 3. I am trying to remember what  (if anything)  I did Wednesday night.... was that DQ adventures in the topaz? I cannot recall. And no I do not have a  drug problem . Its a  SLEEP  problem.   In the meanwhile I am peeling like crazzzzzy from a sunburn I got a week ago... I HATE PEELING! Blah. Nasty Shit.
