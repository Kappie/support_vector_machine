Let's see...  Disturbed  - best songs are "Liberate", "Prayer", "Believe", "Stupify", and "The Game"  System of a Down - best songs are.. hmm pretty much all of the Toxicity album, esp. "X", "Forest", "Atwa", and "Psycho"  Apocalyptica - "Fade to Black", "Nothing Else Matters", "One", "Inquisition Symphony", and much, much more!  Linkin Park - "Plc.4 Mie Head", "Enth E Nd", "Krwling", "My Dsmbr" (all on Reanimation), "Place for My Head", "Papercut", "Crawling" (all on Hybrid Theory), "My December", "High Voltage" (other songs)  Weezer - waaaay too many amazing songs to list, but check out the Pinkerton and Blue albums  311 - "Whos Got the Herb", "Amber", "I Told Myself", "Come Original", "Flowing", and several more  Incubus - every single song is pretty much pure genius  Phish - "Free", "Gin and Juice", "Heavy Things", "Waste"  That's gotta be like a million cool song alerts right there...  Those are just a VERY few of my favorites.  So check them out!  Goodbye dear fans!
