Excuuuuse me! I don't even like dogs or tea and yeah the soaps suck... but America has them too! In a different crappy way, of course, but yeah! I think we can all agree with this once we've seen 'Hang Time' *shivers* Eugh... never again! Any way, back to being test frenzy. Last one, honest!    urlLink Which annoying B-list celebrity are  you ?
