We had 6 people (one very pregnant), 5 dogs, 3 cats, and a bird in there. The sister and dad were going crazy the whole time, and they must have bought half a years worth of non-parishables. Which no one will end up eating. I'm telling ya guys you haven't seen madness until you've spent a hurricane with the Levine's. It's a bit upsetting to see that all that we ended up with was a yard full of sticks. Maybe when I'm older people will listen to me- but I guess that's what I get for being the youngest.... But what I can't believe is how we managed to steal two school days from it. Which is AWESOME..... Another good thing that came out of this storm is the fact that I'm really starting to believe meteorology is my calling. I must of sat on my porch watching that thing for at least an hour, and I was purely amazed the whole time. Storms have always captivated me, I mean I've wanted to be a storm chaser since I was like 5. I stick to my belief that that would be the coolest job in the world. Too bad they make no money. And we all know that's was really makes the world go round.....
