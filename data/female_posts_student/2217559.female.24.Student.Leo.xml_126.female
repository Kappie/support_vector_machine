I just layed there with my eyes closed, tossing and turning - very strange. 6:30Am came awfully early this morning for sure.  I have been studying all afternoon trying to prepare for my first exam on thursday.  Covers 6 chapters and I am pretty nervous about the exam since this will be my first by this professor. First tests of the semester always suck. Anyway, I filled out my online evaluation of this government professor and I felt really good about the feedback I provided. Basically, I wrote that she needed a public speaking class because there should never be 300 ums out of your teachers mouth in hour and a half.   Well, just a short side note to say hello.  Helen (from Scotland) emailed me today. She may come to texas for a visit with my friend Jason. Would be awesome if she did. She is hysterical!!! Everything is grrrrrreat.  Hehehe.  Oh, back to the books. Love, Shell.
