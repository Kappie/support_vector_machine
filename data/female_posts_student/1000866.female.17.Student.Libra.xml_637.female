I kind of went to sleep late last night though because I had a lot of homework.   I talked to Brandon today. I thought about it and realized life's too short to dwell on stuff and I stopped giving him the cold shoulder. I'd rather not have any regrets before this year is over and I would have regretted not making up with him.   Anyway, I must be off. YaY trumpet lesson...
