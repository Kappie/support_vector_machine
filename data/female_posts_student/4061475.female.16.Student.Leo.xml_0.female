Went to work for 2 hours and got put on a tour, I wasn't even in uniform, and "g'day folks welcome to the Bonnechere Caves!" So, needless to say, I'm a little pre-occupied with the singing and the talking to people who don't speak english (they speak french), and I hope that that tour raked in some tips. lol. Anyways going to return movie. Watched Starsky and Hutch and it was disappointing. Then Anything Else, except it was too boring.
