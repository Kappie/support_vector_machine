Then my new friends Stephanie had to go so I said good bye but we forgot to give eachother our e-mail addresses so I will probably never talk to her again which is SUPER SAD. [wow..runnn on sentences at there best!]  Then I ate my chicken burger and my cousin had to go home so I said good bye to her..thenn..  We went ot this play on top of this huge mountain. It was an outdoor ampitheater so you could see like all of san diego from the top of it. You could also see parts of Mexico and the Pacific ocean. It rocked. The play was all right. Not my favorite but it wasn't like i hated it or anything. Then I said my final good byes to the improv people which was reaaally reaaallly sad I almost wanted to cry because I would never see them ever again. Hugging continued. Blah blah blah.  Then we went back to our hotel and Larry, Stephen, Heather, Beka, Jackie and I played pocker with pennies. I really really wanted to ask the other improv people if they wanted to play because they were all on our floor but no one else wanted to. I was sad. Then in the middle of our game for some reason Beka was like "LETS GO RUN!!!" so we ran around all the hallways in our 14 story hotel. it was the greatest thing ever!!! Considering it was 3 in the AM I felt like a total outlaw. It rocked. There was a huge wedding going on and by accident we like ran into the reception. Haha. It was funnnnn-kneee. Then we were all super tired and Larry fell asleep on my bed.Then for like an hour we talked about how bad the improvathon was. I didn't really think it was bad at all. Everyone was saying how it was God's pourpose to bring us here but then he kind of failed us. I don't think it was his pourpose to bring us here to win first place. I think God wanted us to grow closer together. I tried to tell that to everyone but they just kind of glared at me so I was like "Okayy...never mind"  Then we all went to bed and boarded our plane.  Right when I arived at the air port it was off to the beach house. Which is where I am now because my grandpa just alerted me that we do have internet. It is SO slow though. Oh well.  Yesterday we had a little birthdya celebration for my grandpa. He turned 75!! And we planned our trip to NEW YORK!!!!! We are going to see a differen't show every night!! Wooooohooo!!  Then we drove to seaside for the fire works. Those were CRAZY. Everyone is so outof control. You know those huge ones that are at the fire work shows? Someone lit it right next to us and it was supposed to go up in the air but it blew up on the ground and i almost got killed. It was SO scary. I was like screaming and running for my life. Hahahha.  Some day you guys all have to go spend 4th of july with us in Seaside. It is quite a memorable experience!  Then when we got home i went right to bed. I didn't wake up till 12 because i was SO stinking tired.  And now I am here at our beach house being bored.  I am going to try to hitch a ride with my dad tomorrow so I can get home ASAP. I miss Olive!!  Talk to you all later!!  I wuv you guys!!!  Laura Fantora
