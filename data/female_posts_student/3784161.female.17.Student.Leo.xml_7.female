Like that time I was at Jeffrey's and he was playing with his cat. His face got all soft, relaxed. Standing in line at Disney, little kids playing with older brothers, you know those teens don't act that way around their own friends. (btw there is nothing more sexy than a guy good with kids).   God I hope I'm not on a gong. I don't wanna just be there, I want to have a purpose. I wish I could go running right now. Oh how good that would feel.   anyway, g'night - here's hoping for a better tomorrow
