I'll probably be adding most of my entries while sitting here at work (Mayor Mike Ragsdale's office.)  Mayor Mike got his budge passed yesterday,so we can finally relax in the office. I'm working on Billy Stokes campaign for state senate(if anyone is interested in volunteering, let me know!)   I had a very interesting weekend... you can just imagine what I did, if you know me that well.  Let's see... Thursday, I was informed that I acted like a "spoiled freshman southern sorority brat."  I doubt it was from the fact that I threw up in Cool Beans bathroom, or maybe it was because I elbowed this jerk in the chest as hard as I could.  Oh well, it was fun!  Friday I had to call in to work due to my alcohol poisoning (which you'd think I would be used to by now).  Later on, I met Knox County GOP chairman Chad Tindell at Toddy's.  I was being harassed by this old guy who wants to open up a dude ranch.  He has this western show all planned out where my friend Bethany is going to be the Indian girl riding a horse, and I"m going to be the little plantation girl that gets kidnapped.  I thought it was rather amusing.  Saturday I was proud of myself... I stayed up till 7 am in the hot tub with my roomies and some neighbors... I lost count of how much beer I actually drank.  Funny thing was, I don't remember seeing the sunrsie, but somehow I just noticed it was light.  To anyone reading this, have a great Memorial Day weekend... I'm going to Cinci... yet another one of my "wild" college friends is getting married and my little baby cousin is graduating high school!  God... I'm getting old!
