Somehow, our path shifted into innocent flirting and tons of sexual tension. He has a girlfriend (GF to protect the innocent and my ass) and I have a boyfriend (BF to save my ass again). I was accused of hooking up with 'a' by my BF but it never happened. Is it okay to continue a friendship with 'a' considering that we have semi-feelings for each other? What if we agree not to act on them? Is that just asking for trouble? Does feelings for someone else mean that I do not have strong enough feelings for my BF or is this just normal?  urlLink Do friendships with the opposite sex count as cheating?  According to  urlLink Why You Don’t Have to Have Sex to Cheat    How Do You Know If You’re Being Unfaithful? Consider your own personal relationships:   When you hear a funny joke or good piece of gossip, do you first tell other colleagues? By the time you get home, have you chewed it all over so much at the office that you don’t feel like telling that joke again to your spouse?   Do you discuss all of your work problems (or issues involving volunteer work or other important things you are involved in) so thoroughly with colleagues that you’re all talked out by the time you return home? Do you feel like it would take too long to review and explain the entire issue from scratch to your spouse?   Do you go out alone to lunch or after work for drinks with members of the opposite sex?   Do you enjoy harmless (by your definition) flirtation with someone of the opposite sex at a cocktail party?   Do you believe that getting emotionally excited by flirting with someone of the opposite sex is helpful to your marriage? Do you think it helps educate you as to what you need more of from your spouse? Do you tell yourself that the juice you get from flirting brings more vitality to your marriage?   Do you spend as long buying the “right gift” for a colleague of the opposite sex as you do for your own spouse?   Do you ride in a car sharing pleasant, personal conversation alone with a member of the opposite sex on the way to meetings or other work-related events?   Do you share intimate issues about yourself or marriage with a member of the opposite sex?   If you’re doing any of these things, you’re being emotionally unfaithful to your spouse. You have only so much energy. If you’re spending it with coworkers or outside the home and then getting home and feeling too tired to spend any more on your spouse, that’s emotional infidelity. You’re effectively relocating vital marital energy into the hands of others. Forget about where it might end up. Even if you never touch this other person, you have still used that person to relate to, and in doing so, you relate away from your spouse.    a: you awake? me: yup a: you want to go see the YANKS tomorrow? im blowing off work. at the DINER right now. me: i got no loot a: my battery is about to die a: got enought to drive down and back? want to get out of there? need company? a: wake up kid a: if you didnt want to go all you had to do was say so, not make up some story. me: i was not making up a story and i do want to go but i have no money and i told BF i would help him. a: dont bullshit a bullshitter. you were scrambling to find an excuse not to go because youre scared. of what? me: thats not it at all. im sorry that i think slow sometimes. a: im sorry i may jump the gun sometimes. i like spending time w/you, and my intentions arent always innocent. me: its ok i understand. i like spending time eith u too. what do u mean your intentions are not always innocent? a: like sometimes i care about you and think about you more than i let on me: thats sweet i care about u too me: whats the matter with that? a: i just am not always doing it to be friendly...are you catching my drift? ;-> me: that u want to do the things i was accused of doing with u? a: im not going to deny that i think about it. especially how well we get along me: if it makes u feel any better i thought about it. a: its not like im desperate here and i need pity. im being sincere when i say that i really enjoy spending time with you. me: i dont remember pitying you or calling u desperate. i was being sincere. a: maybe it was just me misinterpreting. i sorry. the more time i spend with you, the more i want to spend with you me: i feel the same way a: so heres the million dollar question...WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT? me: honestly, i have no clue a: me either. all i know is that i like you, and i like being around you me: me too a: how serious are you with BF? me: how serious are you with GF? a: good question. i dont know anymore. the fact that i have feelings for you has to count for something me: same thing here a: what should we do? me: probably nothing right now a: little tough isnt it?
