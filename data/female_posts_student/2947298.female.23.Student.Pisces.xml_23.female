I have enough of my own crap in my own life I do not need yours on top of my own. So if you're gonna act like an asshole, well then fine but do it somewhere and to someone else. I'm worth more than that, and you being an idiot is just insulting to yourself.  Really love  Pearl Jam  all over again, I found my Vitology CD. Can't find my other one though, the one with  urlLink  RearView Mirror   on it.  Great song... Also  Coming Up From Behind by Marcy's Playground . Ross intruduced me to that one.  And I went through the hell that is housing selection.  Village 13E  with my roomies Crystal, Josie and Chrissy. Ross also succeeded in getting CPA! Congrats to all.  Been working out, yoga and Winsor Pilates, sometimes the gym with Crystal.  Went off my diet because of Easter, will start up again.  Have to look great in my bikini when we go to the Carribean. They have topless beaches right?  J/K , you know that doesn't matter to me, like I need permission!!!   EASTER is coming up, and PASSOVER , so happy holidays. Going home for Easter breakfast and dinner.  YUM FOOD.  Went shopping today for my  sister's BirthDay !!!  She is 13 ! How amazing and scary. And if anyone so much as looks at her the wrong way, I'll break their fecking knees.  Eh sometimes I still feel alone and lost. We only get so many chances in life, and how many of them have we given up on?, or how many have been given up for us? I think no two people can love eachother equally, one will always love the other more or less.  I do not think true love felt equally between people can be had.  A Mother will love her child more, or will not love the child at all. One friend will always take advantage over the other. And one lover will always think it's nicer that the other loves them more, and the other will just be so in love as not to notice the un-equality. So there is not equal true love, always the scales will bend this way and that, and no equal hate for that much, but there will always be equal feelings on nutrality but never of strong emotions such as love and hate.So many missed chances, so many chances I was never given. Never was I given the chance when I was willing to take it. These moments of meloncholy piss me the fuck off. Damn thinking Damn it all. Sometimes being stupid seems more like a blessing I woudl rather have.  Sometimes, but then again being a drooling idiot would make me so much more like the idiots I long ago left behind. And why can we not leave all the past behind, something always lurks behind the bends... always. Maybe I'm not the only person to feel upset, infact I know it.  Maybe I am not the only one who was screwed over, and I know I did my fair share of fucking things up myself. The fact that I cheated on more exes than I ever admitted to them, (aside from one pete and my current boy who doesnt count ross) worries me, and the fact I broke them off always, and yet I have this fear of getting cheated on, left and broken up with. I know I was always out to get them before they get me, but they were assholes who ended up doing their fair share also in the end. I feel I've met the first person I trust the most ever, and hence the no problem. I know I have this fear of commitment and this fear of being alone, but I try to deal with those two total oposites, I found someone who I can talk to about anything and just understands me more than anyone, which is amazing.  Life isn't so bad,  DEATH THE HIGH COST OF LIVING ...    Nothing's gonna save me, I can see I can't say I'm fearful, I can't say I'm not afraid But I am not resisting, I can see I don't need a heaven, I don't need religion I am in the place where I should be I am breathing water, You know a body's got to breathe REM Undertow
