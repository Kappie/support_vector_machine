Europe is going to be awesome. And then in April, when I go to New York! Ahh, so much anticipation. And then of course the summer is going to be the best summer over, because my friends and I are the coolest people ever.  I just love it, all this excitement and adventure...it's spectacular. Sure, there's stress in my life too, but it all involves school. And if that's the only stress factor in my life, then I'd have to say I must be one of the luckiest people alive. Went shopping this weekend and I DIDN'T MEAN TO SPEND MONEY, DAMMIT! But I did. Just imagine how crazy Paris is going to be. Oh, and all the markets in Tangier...oh, I'm gonna go crazy. I love attention. I dress for attention, I act for attention, I do alot of things to get noticed. Is that wrong of me?  I think not!  I don't think craving attention is a bad thing.  I just have ALWAYS had this feeling inside of me like I can't slip into the seams, I can't fall into the background.  If I'm not remembered, if I'm not acknowledged...then I haven't done my job.  Still looking for an internship. Haven't really been looking actively, but maybe it's time to start.  People who doubt me in life, are my motivation.  Remember that when you tell me that I'll amount to nothing. Because every time someone has said that to me, I never forget.  They probably don't remember saying it, but I could quote them. And someday that motivation will be the words they'll be shoving up their asses.  It's good to have people behind me too.  They are my pure motivation.  It's nice to have both sides. The people who want to see me succeed, and the people waiting for me to fail.  Because I wouldn't ever let myself fail in life.  That's not how I work. My friends know that, those who doubt me (I hesitate to say enemies...I don't care enough about people like that to call them enemies) will learn it soon enough.  Step one...get out of Keller. This means college. I'm narrowing my search down, narrowing the choices down, and I've picked my good choice college that I'll have to work toward, and I've picked my safety school.  I feel like maybe I'm not being totally open-minded, but I know what I want.  That's as open-minded as this decision is going to get.  Well, it's time to sleep.  Deal with the way I am, crazies.
