Yea verily, I have been reading Lauren's blog again and I need to feel better. Thus, the list was born.  Things that don't hurt me:  1) Beadwork. When I'm doing beadwork, NOTHING upsets me. Tangled thread, dropped beads, nothing. It's all part of it. I love making things that people will buy and wear or not wear, it doesn't matter. When I do a project, I don't think about time, I don't think about anything I don't want to. Nothing can upset me when I'm following a pattern and pulling the needle around. I love picking out colors and spending HOURS and HOURS choosing beads and colors and thread. It's great, I have tons of beads, but I never seem to have exactly what I need. I wish I could find better 11s.  2) A Knight's Tale. This movie cracks me up, I know all the words, literally. Anachronism rocks it. And Heath Ledger is hot.  3) Maps. I love the maps on my walls, they represent different things to me, all important. My Texas map, where I grew up and started to realize I was a person. The Ohio map from the thirties, which reminds me of the past...people used it, depended on it, and now I have it on my wall. How cool is that. My US map, which is only the east coast, because the west is on the other side. I've SEEN the west coast, I want to see the other half. My world map that my grandfather gave me reminds me of where I want to go and what I want to be. It's...I don't know. They make me happy.  I'll think of more later, I know there are more, but those are the first three that came to mind.  Jesse's detouring from Okla, possibly, so we might have lunch sometime next week. I'm hoping Thursday. Because if it's not, we're totally having grilled cheese at my house. I only have an hour for lunch from band camp, and that's not enough time to get anything more than fast food from The City. I hope it works out. I hate fuzzy plans.  I got another email from Lauren today. I LOVE getting emails from her, we talk very rarely, compared to me and my other friends.  I feel like Tara's abandoning me for everything, but she assures me it's normal and we'll still talk when she's in college. I trust her. I trust her with this. She's not just friends with me because she was bored.  You know what's delicious? Grilled cheese sandwiches with egg in them. YUM. Seriously...soooo good. I actually bought and consumed Ramen today. I hate Ramen. Ew. Also, it's incredibly salty.  I quit my job, and I went to turn in my uniform, but they offered me the COOLEST thing, I'm not being scheduled, I can just call and come in whenever the hell I feel like it. I'm totally working Sundays after school starts, and weeknights only when I want to. That's like 70 dollars every two weeks, after taxes. That's not too bad...spending money. 140 dollars a month. It's STILL more than I've ever gotten in my life, ever, excluding birthdays.  I have to call Lauren before August 18.
