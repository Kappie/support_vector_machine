I have so much to do but spending time in bed has made me lazy. Still no letter from AC. I'm hoping something comes soon. He said he would be back by June and it is nearly that time. I have no patience and tend to worry even though he has a couple of days left. Will he make it ? I hope so. Three loads of laundry left to do. School meeting with Joey's school today at 3. Travis will take me not something I am looking forward to. I will be writing more later and letting you know how the school meeting goes. Well it went as well as can be expected considering the whole thing was a waste of time. Oh well at least it is over and done with. Still nothing from AC. I know it's time to wait and learn patience but I am still starting to worry. OTher then that things are good. I am going to go and get some sleep. It's only 6:20 but I need to sleep. Right now everyone is talking in the background and stuff. Until later Hugs
