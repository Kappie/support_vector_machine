It saddens me, that all those men died fighting so that we could be free, so that people can be different religions such as: Jehovah  Witnesses, or Christians. They died for freedom. My brother is in the ARMY, and it makes me sad thinking that he may go into War. But without War the United States wouldn't be that. We are what we are (free) because of War, the Revolutionary War. I am proud of this Country, and honored to have a brother in the United States Military. And I am really proud of all the men and women in this country who are brave enough to enter the Military. I may enter the Military when I turn eighteen, but that's just a thought, I'm not sure yet.  No matter what anyone thinks the ARMY, NAVY,and Marines are the greatest tools of this Country. Thank you to all the brave men and women. And to all the parents who lost someone in Iraq, I am very sorry. They were all very courageous.
