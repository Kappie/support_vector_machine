I always wondered why no one actually made a shower like that, with a blow-dryer built right in, so like Zhora, you could just go right from the shower to being a badass killer without stopping to towel off and use your Conair.    urlLink Jacuzzi  has finally made it a reality. The  urlLink Summer Rain shower systems  come with the option to add "The Ambient Air Body Dry System". 12 air jets blast out warm air up to 150 degrees farenheit, and dry you completely before you even step out of the shower. Replicants probably don't even feel the cold, but for us, that first step out of the hot steam would be a lot more pleasant after a head-to-toe blow dry.  No word on how much this option will cost, but Summer Rain showers start at about $5500.   Read more in the  urlLink Jacuzzi press release .
