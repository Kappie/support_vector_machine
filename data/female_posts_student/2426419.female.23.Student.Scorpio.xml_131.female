I don't know what it is about Oklahoma Christian girls, but we were all so tight and we always said how gorgeous each other was and everything. We'd bash boys together and we'd hug a lot. And we'd always say "I love you" as we were leaving or hanging up the phone.  It was a little different with boys, although I have several guy friends who say it to me all the time, and I know it doesn't mean "gosh, let me marry you someday" or anything romantic. I think that people assume, when you even use the word "love" concerning them that you mean it as a binding contract or an intention and it scares them off. But anytime I have ever said it, i have never meant it as that. I just meant that . . . oh crap. I'll finish this later. I have to brush my teeth and get back to work. This is an interesting topic Corey.   . . . I'm back. But I have ten minutes until Jaci picks me up, so I really should be getting ready. Yeah, I'll finish this later. sigh.
