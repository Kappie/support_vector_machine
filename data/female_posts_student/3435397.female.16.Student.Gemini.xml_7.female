So I just went to a movie with my bitch little sister and my mom who doesn't love their mom? She paid so it was good! Anyway I saw  The Prince and Me   it was pretty good I guess right.  Well let me change that it was very good but very fairy taleish:S. You meet the ever so very very freakin hot guy and then you find out he is prince he asks you to marry him you say yes blah blah blah then you leave him and he comes and finds you. you know the rest! So you see if all relationships were like that it would be oh so very realistic....Maybe I am just jealousy that I cant have a decent guy....*sigh*.  I will stop felling sorry for my self I guess. For all you non-single friends of mine(MEGAN!!!!) Hold on to those hot guys of yours because if you let them go they might come back from their palace or not and just say fuck her! Any Hot French chick would like a piece of this......NOT!!!! Anyway sorry I am kind of in a bitch/hyper/crazy/I don't know kind of mood today.   WEIRD!!!!!  So......I bought a new swimsuit today...Another one appropriate for camp! YES!!!! I started this thing that for every pair of shoes I own I need at least one swimsuit.......at least I don't have as many shoes as Josh(sorry dude). OH!!!! Here is the song that Neil gave me the other day:D One Sweet Day By: Mariah Carey Sorry I never told you All I wanted to say And now it's too late to hold you 'Cause you've flown away So far away  Never had I imagined Living without your smile Feeling and knowing you hear me It keeps me alive Alive  And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we've lost along the way And I know eventually we'll be together One sweet day  Darling, I never showed you Assumed you'd always be there I took your presence for granted But I always cared And I miss the love we shared  And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we've lost along the way And I know eventually we'll be together One sweet day  Although the sun will never shine the same I'll always look to a brighter day Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep You will always listen as I pray  And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we've lost along the way And I know eventually we'll be together One sweet day  And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we've lost along the way And I know eventually we'll be together One sweet day  Sorry I never told you All I wanted to say  It's A very very good song I can tell you that much! Anywho I am out I have freakin homework like no other and I have to clean my room which looks like my suitcase exploded after Calgary and Banff Later Gator!
