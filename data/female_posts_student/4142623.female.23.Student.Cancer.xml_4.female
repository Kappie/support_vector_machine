I just wrote this really long post, and the computer deleted it.  Dang computer.  I'm going to retire, as my dad says.  I played really hard today, and I have to move tomorrow.  I will be in Clements 424!!!!  I have moved ten times in college.  The moving gods hate me.  "He reached down from on high and took hold of me;  he drew me out of deep waters...  He brought me out in to a spacious place;  he rescued me because he delighted in me."        Psalm 18:16,19
