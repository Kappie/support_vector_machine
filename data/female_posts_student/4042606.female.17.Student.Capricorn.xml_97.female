When I woke up this morning I looked beside me in the bed to see Mute sleeping peacefully. I laid there for like an hour just starring at him sleep. I don't know what the feeling was, but, it was a good one. It was like all my problems just sort of drifted off into the night. I know we are just really good friends, but, it is nice to know that there is someone out there in the world that cares about me. This is the first morning in a long time I haven't woke up either pissed off or depressed. It is something I could get used to.
