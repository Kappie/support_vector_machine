She probably has 13 or more... Today, I'm glad to tell her that I've been working hard to build my strong sisterhood. And now I am glad to say that I've doubled my number. Huh! Think only guys have strong MFBH?  We gals have strong sisterhood as well. Agreed babe?  With MY GOD I can scale ANY mountain, 2Sam22:30(NLT)  Thats from Alice babe, My dearest sister from cell.  She's this really sweet darling gal who has recently found her Godly partner Who happens to have eyes that makes gals in our cell melt... Oki I'd stop teasing you babe.  God is kind to me. He knows that I am weak at a time like now, Easily swayed, influenced and defeated. And He has blessed me with good frens like her. She never fails to motivate me with the Word of God. Such a kind and strong soul she is.  God answers prayers in 3 ways. Yes, No and Wait. I have prayed about this. There is no answer yet. God is probably saying WAIT. Delay is not denial.  If u haven seen the direction yet,dun stop prayin...ask God to open ur eyes so dat u can see what's His will for u in this.  James 1:5-6 in NLT version sez:  If u need wisdom, if u want to know what God wants u to do, ask him n he'll gladly tell u.  He will not resent your asking.  But when u ask Him,  be sure that you really expect Him to answer,  for a doubtful mind is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.  The best thing God can do for me is to repeat the miracle He has done.. So the best thing He can do for me now is to deliver me outta this Espresso guy.  The Word of God is like a double edged sword. It is able to pierce the heart of man n separate what is black n what is white.  The gettin out process is tough but Ade's God is a mighty God.  We've to go thru things we dun like in life at times  And it's cuz God loves us too much to let us remain the same person... He wants to see u changed..to be a better person.  Den we can be a testimony to the people in the world. So dat in future when people are in this position, we can tell them how we got out of this  And lead them to God cuz God has the ultimate solution.  Everytime we do something dat we noe God duzen want us to do,  God's actually waiting for us to come back to Him  And whenever we decide to come back to God, He'll alwiz welcome us with open arms.
