If my idiotic, imbusilic brother could just grab the freaking concept of picking up his godforsaken toys I wouldn't have been stuck inside this house all week.  Things have been extremely hard for me lately. My grandmother was diagnosed with malignant liver cancer, being stuck inside the house, Laura moving, waiting for Caitlin to come home, Mike being away for so long, and the kids at vacation bible school...I really need some extra patience.  Nicole and I are going surfing tomorrow after vacation bible school, then maybe paying a certain someone a visit where they're working for the next few weeks...We'll just see how things go.  I'm out.  Love you guys, as much as it may seem like I don't.
