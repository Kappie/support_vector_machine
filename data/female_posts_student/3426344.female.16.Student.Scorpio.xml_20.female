I nearly suffocated myself trying to play the flute and the trumpet.  I broke the reads on the clarinet and sax. Then broke som strings on the violin.  I tried the guitar but i didnt get it.  I also tried the piano but i (lets see, apropriate word??) SUCKED!!! So i cannot play an instrament.  My dad however playes the saxes, he was as short as me in freshmen band (NO comment Zack) and played the barry sax, he owns an alto and tenor.  When he was in the army he played in the band.  he played the clarenet and flute also.  To clear up the word bando- california term- i will give you all a definition  Bandos- Not band geeks because they are cool/nice enough to hang with choras kids.
