Each contaning a small amount of food. The only thing that is available in plenty is rice...sticky rice. Mostly you will end up eating the rice to fill your stomach and drinking the soup little by little to wash it down.   Actually in my experience we all need a game plan to eat Japanese food. First taste everything that is available on your table. Usually the food in the smallest of dishes are the most tastiest. Rate all of these food items in your mind according to their taste starting from one. Give the worst one a score of one and the better tasting ones a higher score. Now divide these rates by quantity of the food item that you have in front of you. Bubble sort the values. Now start with the food item that has the least score and eat accordingly.  A few other important tips:  1) Whatever you do do not keep the rice to the last without saving a little soup to wash it down. There is a danger of choking when you eat sticky Japanese rice.  2) Never mistake the green paste near your sashimi for fresh green colored whipped cream, or a small piece of cake. Better keep it as far away from you as possible.  3) There are 2 similar cups. One containing your tea and other containing your tempura sauce. Never get mixed up with the two. Tempura tastes worser when dipped in tea than when it is dipped in sauce.   Jokes apart it is fun to be eating Japanese food with all that variety and grandeur. Its an opprotunity one gets on very rare occasions. I have found that Japanese rice is the sweetest of all other rice varieties, which explains why it is usually eaten plain. Sashimi tastes great when you dip it in sauce and a tinge of wasabi(the green paste)...you only have to know the correct proportion when you mix them.  The soup usually miso flavored tastes awsome. Sea food comes in diferent shapes and tastes that you can only wonder how they can keep track of them all.   So heres my advice...try Japanese food. A few things might be raw but the experience of eating them is in itself great.
