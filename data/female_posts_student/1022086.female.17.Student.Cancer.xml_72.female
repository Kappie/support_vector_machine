Life (even out of the jungle!) has scoowampled to be pretty hectically busy even though summer vacation landed its long sought-after bum in my way finally; nonetheless, I've been having much fun. Yesterday I gots me butt majorly kicked at bowling, but 'twas very good times-ly. (SHUT UP. Yes, you know I'm talking to you if you're you, you.)  Today was Orlando Jr.'s graduation party. I'm copiously proud of him for round-about obtaining his diploma. His next intendment is the army; he's already set to leave on August 26, and I pride and respect him for picking himself up and realizing that he can make it through something in life. I honestly believe in him and think he will do great.   Otherwise, the baby rescued me... Although the food was ambrosial and I ate far more than I should have (even my aunt admitted that I have, indeed, gained weight *insert frown here*), the actuality of being present was asphyxiating. My nuisance revolved around innerving morons, mainly. Because this was a supposedly more intimate party than what things like these usually turn out to be, Orlando had but a few friends over, and their parental units unfortunately either decided to tag along or were officially invited. Certain witches that Aunt Juliana appeared to befriend were gossiping to no end. I realize it may sound as though I were doing the same right now, but I was highly irked because they were nettlesome without minding their own flaws and businesses. A guy present, likely 22 or 23 years old, had a 7-month-old baby. They criticized him in any way possible behind his back, and that really angered me. First of all, the guy was incredibly nice, and secondly, I thought he was doing a good job. The baby is healthy, and he takes care of it and his significant other he had the baby with (I don't know whether he's married). I respect the simple fact that he and the girl are working and sticking together, and he really seemed as though he were a good dad. It was brilliant in the literal sense of the word to observe the light that infested his face every time he saw Riley, the baby. The witches ridiculed his job and his decisions on raising the baby and anything that could eventually catenate onto such topics. Grrr!!!  Therefore, the only other alternative was transfering to the scorchingly hot inferno that was outside-- anything but gossip!! There, the one thing that I truly despise for people to do to me was done to me. The present group of "adults" seemed very good at patronizing me and crushing any idealism I might have managed not to lose priorly. However, they didn't succeed in the latter beyond an extent. I feel as though I shouldn't listen to anything that comes out of their mouths as they all screwed up their lives. Besides that, they flat out told me that all I should be concerned with is making money, which is against anything I've ever believed. Surely, money is nice, and I do want to be able to sustain myself, but it is absolutely not the most important thing to look out for. Call me crazy, but I maintain that it is possible to find something to do with one's life that can truly make one rejoice. Here's an even crazier idea: I'm going to find something that applies to me so,  and  I'm going to embrace it. So, ha! There is a dedication on an AMV: "For everyone who never learned to give up hope". It's too bad that so many people learn to give up hope. I'm trying really hard not to be one of them.  Anyway, things got a lot better once the plethora of ignoramuses started departing. We and the fellow with the baby were the last to leave. The baby was one of the coolest babies I've ever come across! She is very intelligent and interesting. She loves food, and she investigates things more than "normal babies" seem to. She doesn't cry a lot, and she is relatively happy. Finally, she is a tryer. She almost started walking and actually succeded in standing up on her own as we were cheering her to try, an idea she was fast to seize. Yay for clever babies!!!      I might should could would maybe attempt cleaning the jungle a bit more, maybe. Ren Fest with a Kat tomorrow! Yay!
