I don't think I'll really get it until we cross the border tomorrow. Are you sure I don't live here? Are you certain this isn't my home? Why are we going on vacation to Texas, and when are we coming back?  Seriously. I know I haven't posted on this blog much, but that's because I've been having such a great time. Man, today's the  last  day? Crazy.  We went out to dinner last night, which was cool. More significant is the fact that I was taught how to do hair and makeup. I doubt I can remember it all, so I'll ask Katie and Alafair to write all of that stuff down for me. I think Dad has some pictures of me looking all snazzy...he said he'd post one.  Oh, and I bought Becky some presents today cuz Dad made me. I'm a terrible shopper; I never know what to get people, so that's why I haven't bought gifts. But hey, at least Becky'll get something. Not telling you what it is, though. I think she reads this blog.  Had something else to say...Oh, the Arendales are off in some town for the day. Except Avery; she and I went 'shopping' together. For gifts.   Bagh! Forget this. Maybe I'll post something else later. I'm too busy  urlLink reading Sluggy Freelance  to pay this thing any heed. And I'm hungry. I think I'll go seek potatoes...
