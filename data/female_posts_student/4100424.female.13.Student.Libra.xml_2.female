We ask you to read the following and decide whether that's true. Here are Ringling's own words juxtaposed with the facts:Ringling:"At Ringling Bros., the relationship between animals and humans is built on mutual respect, trust, and affection." Reality:Video footage of Ringling trainers shows an elephant being whipped in the face and gouged with metal hooks. Ringling:"We are proud of our USDA inspection reports." Reality:Ringling Bros.' USDA inspection reports are riddled with instances in which federal inspectors found that Ringling Bros. had failed to comply with minimum federal regulations, and the circus has been cited for causing animals unnecessary trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, and discomfort, a failure to provide animals with veterinary care, a failure to provide animals exercise, a failure to provide sufficient space, as well as not keeping the proper veterinary records. Ringling:"None of our animals are taken from the wild." Reality:The Asian Elephant Regional Stud Book, the industry resource for information on elephant births, deaths, and captures, shows that the majority of Ringling's elephants were captured in the wild. Ringling:"Trainers teach animals routines that showcase their natural behaviors, beauty, and distinctive personalities."Reality:In nature, bears don't ride bicycles, elephants don't stand on their heads, and a tiger would never hop on his hind legs. To force wild animals to perform confusing acts, trainers use whips, muzzles, electric prods, and bullhooks. In their real homes, these animals would be free to raise their families, forage for food, and play together. Instead, the circus forces them to perform night after night, for 48 to 50 weeks every year. Between acts, elephants are kept chained and tigers are "stored" in cages with barely enough room to take one step. Ringling has also invented a "unicorn" by mutilating a baby goat--surgically moving his horns to the center of his forehead. Ringling:"Future generations will be able to experience the wonder ... of Asian elephants because of what we're doing today." Reality:Circuses have claimed for decades that exhibiting endangered Asian elephants will inspire their protection. Yet in 2000, poachers killed 60 free-roaming female elephants so that their babies could be collected and sold to the entertainment industry. The still-nursing elephants, all under the age of 3, refused to abandon their dead mothers, even attempting to suckle from their corpses. Ringling:"Our training methods are based on positive reinforcement in the form of food rewards and words of praise." Reality:Ringling has opposed proposed laws banning cruel training methods. In comments submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture dated April 17, 2000, Ringling opposed language in the agency’s "Draft Policy on Training and Handling of Potentially Dangerous Animals" that reads, "Hot shots, shocking collars, or shocking belts should not be used for training or to handle the animals during exhibition, and any such use will be closely scrutinized. An ankus may not be used in an abusive manner that causes wounds or other injuries." Ringling:"We fully cooperate with all U.S. Department of Agriculture investigations."Reality:According to an internal February 25, 1999, U.S. Department of Agriculture memo written by an inspector and detailing injuries found on two baby elephants during a February 9, 1999, inspection, "[Ringling veterinarian] Dr. Lindsay was very upset and asked repeatedly why we could not be more collegial and call him before we came. I explained to him that all our inspections are unannounced. ... All Ringling personnel were very reluctant to let us take pictures [of the calves’ rope lesions]. … [Ringling employee Jim Williams] proceeded to interrogate me. … He then began badgering me. … He then walked away in apparent disgust." Ringling:"Ringling Bros. has pioneered the use of a traveling perimeter fence within which our elephants can exercise and socialize." Reality:In 1993, Ringling Bros. helped defeat legislation in California that would have limited the number of hours per day that elephants could be chained. Ringling wrote, "Chaining is a safe and acceptable means of protecting both the elephants and the public." To read more about what's wrong with elephants in circuses,  urlLink click here .

Here are some quick facts: In the wild, bears don’t ride bicycles, tigers don’t jump through fiery hoops, and elephants don’t stand upright on their hind legs. Circuses portray a distorted view of wildlife.Laws protecting animals in traveling shows are inadequate and poorly enforced. The Animal Welfare Act establishes only minimum guidelines and even these meager standards are often ignored.Animals used in circuses live a dismal life of domination, confinement, and violent training. It is standard practice to beat, shock, and whip them to make them perform ridiculous tricks that they cannot comprehend.Most elephants used by circuses were captured in the wild. Once removed from their families and natural habitat, their lives consist of little more than chains and intimidation. Baby elephants born in breeding farms are torn from their mothers, tied with ropes, and kept in isolation until they learn to fear their trainers.Big cats, bears, and primates are forced to eat, drink, sleep, defecate, and urinate in the same cramped cages.Elephants often suffer crippling injuries from constant chaining and performing physically difficult tricks.Children, who are naturally fond of animals, would have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the circus if they knew of the suffering these animals endure for a fleeting moment of so- called amusement.The circus deprives animals of their basic needs to exercise, roam, socialize, forage, and play. Stereotypic behaviors such as swaying back and forth, head-bobbing, pacing, bar-biting, and self-mutilation are common signs of mental distress.Using dangerous animals in performances jeopardizes public safety and often puts children at greatest risk. Since 1990, 57 people have been killed and more than 120 seriously injured by captive elephants.Animals in circuses are hauled around the country in poorly ventilated trailers and boxcars for up to 50 weeks a year in all kinds of extreme weather conditions. Access to the basic necessities of food, water, and veterinary care is often inadequate.A growing number of cities are restricting or banning the use of animals in entertainment. More progressive circuses dazzle their audiences solely with skilled human performers.
