(how i know, don't try to find out... i just know..)  what this day did to me:  ¤i hate myself even more.. ¤i realized that i need  to find a way... *how to die easy* ¤i'm not alone... i could DIE with someone... ¤i started having second thoughts about... stuff...  what i just realized(with the help of my dying friends):  ¤you can never die easy... ¤i hate math... and math hates me... ¤"death, like life... is not easy." -bobbie  what i want to do now after everything  that's happened(and after all the complaints and realizations):   ¤I want to die easy... but then again... i don't want to die easy... i don't even think i want to die.... i guess i'm already dead... panu ka pa mamatay kung patay ka na diba? haha.. TALK ABOUT CONFUSION...   m outin!!
