I'm in a very depressed mood right now, when I was just in a very happy mood about..oh..ten minutes ago. There are a few reasons for my sudden depression that I can easily name, though...  1. I've had to deal with my two sets of grandparents since 10 this morning till 8 p.m. It's very exhausting, answering the same questions every time when we're with the grandparents that practically have alzheimer's/dementia, and being at the second grandparents' house, I'm always criticized for every little thing I do. I hate these kinds of days..father's day..mother's day..well, basically any sort of day that I'm forced to go visit relatives and get no gifts in return. I've also had to deal with my parents in the car. Sometimes I wish they would just divorce already. They fight over every little thing, and it's not the kind of nice fighting where people apologize in the end and make-up. It's just..enh. It's enough of a warning for me to not want to ever marry, at least. I don't understand marriage. I mean, normally people "fall in love" because they talk to a person a lot and...well, if you're stuck with a person long enough, your mind can normally force you to find some positive aspect about them. But that being-together-ness for...say, twenty-five years? It's enough to drive anyone insane. The idea of marriage is just fucked up, in my opinion o.-; But then, I'm having some raging hormone-induced thoughts right now that are also triggered by my overdosing on chocolate after I had lunch today..  2. I had a  lot  of chocolate. Chocolate leads to most of my chaotic moodswings. I'll probably be feeling either quite happy in a few minutes, or angry at the world, or just very sulky and sullen. I dunno.  3. I was reading  Trickster's Choice  by Tamora Pierce today, in order to avoid most of the pathetic attempts at conversation that my family tries on me. I love Pierce's books, but they just...leave me feeling so incomplete. Right now, I'm pretty much yearning for my own Nawat Crow and wishing I could live in Tortall. >  4. I have a tournament tomorrow in Winston that..the girls in my category..well, almost all of them have beaten me once. It's..blehhh. wish me luck -_-  Ok. After typing all that, I feel better now. I think I'm just going to publish this without reading over it, because if I read over it, I know I'm going to edit some stuff.  Song for today: Hello Somebody by Handsome Devil I've only been able to find this song, and Makin' Money by a group called Handsome Devil..and I love both of the songs ^^; I wish I could find more, though. hn. I love the part.."If I seem a little rude, please excuse me, I was raised on the dark side"..XD The twinge of vibrato their lead singer has makes the songs great.
