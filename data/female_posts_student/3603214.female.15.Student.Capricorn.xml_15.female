The truth shall set you free fo sho. I am so ticked at the world right now. Nothing seems to be going right. Somebody just kidnap me RIGHT NOW! DAMNIT! My life sucks. I don't wanna see my father tomorrow. I want to disown him. Hey! If anyone can claim me in their family, I'll participate in whatever Father's Day rituals you have lol. GLADLY! O yea, Tasha, I'll remind my evil mom that you'll love her forever lol. Mandy, I'll beg cuz we need a Depp-a-thon n if your bro has a problem w/ it, tell him to get over it since I'm gonna be there late for the party anyway. Wait, why am I talkin to Mandy?
