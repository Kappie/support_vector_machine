This two party system is leaving most of america behind. We need to let new parties shine through that vary in beliefs in degrees. It will help the elected officials truly understand the concept of  compromise, and it will help eliminate the extremists. Extremists who get votes now because people would rather vote for someone in their party than the opposition party. Imagine if they had more parties to chose from? If someone actually met their needs? Sure the majority levels for each individual candidate would be lower BUT the overall representation would be improved.  And the other major topic of my mysteriously disappearing blog is that it is one of those "this is so my life" coincidences that at the same time it would be become financially necessary to move in with my in-laws it would be an election year.I am very political and opinionated. They are registered and tried and true republicans. My husband and I democrats...but most importantly socially liberal and fiscally social(istic.) I do try not to push too many hot buttons. I cant help but crack a few jokes....Bush is in town today and my mom called yesterday to ask if I wanted to go to the Anti-Bush demonstration. I dont like crowds and I protest daily here so I kindly said no. I also wanted to keep the peace here in the free housing we are receiving. I joked with his dad that my mom called and asked him to come to the protest...he thought that was a hoot. (whew!) Although, I must admit that its easier living with republicans than anarchist communists. Its easier to completely disagree with someone rather than agree with their premises and disagree with their outcomes.   Right...well in the original version of this blog I talked about how trying to please every voter will please no one...and that we need a multiparty system so as to truly reflect the different views of the american electorate. People arent voting because no one represents them closely enough. They disagree with something essential from both sides...thus we need more sides. I dont propose we do this through bloody revolution (but you can ask my anarchist communist friends about that...) rather we must make our system more flexible and make it possible for the mutiparty.  Saw Bush's speech today. The best and only good moment was when he told our mayor to "get those potholes filled." About time someone ABOVE the political level of the mayor told him so:P Bush is a pompous ass. Those educators who sat in on the "discussion on education" are crazy. There were there just sitting there, going along with him. When I KNOW for a fact that most teachers and administrators HATE the "No Child Left Behind" premise. The exams test a childs ability to take a test...not on whether they have learned. Plus they lost many more teaching days to taking the tests so they have fewer learning days in school. PLUS Bush mentioned the bill he is trying to get through Congress to get professionals as teachers in the classroom. There are already NOT ENOUGH JOBS FOR ALL THE TEACHERS OUT THERE....he has some balls to say that he would be giving professionals teaching jobs in a room full of teachers.    All in all, as he talked about putting every american child into college I am left wondering two things. 1) What will happen to Labor work that does not require a college education? For example my husband has a college degree in media studies and started a career in radio - an industry that by and far doesnt require or need one. He got off to his career 4 years late because of going to college, and now that hes old enough that hes married and could be wanting to have a family, or just in general have more financial responsibilities, hes four years behind in income and its not working out well at all. Just one more reason hes going to study computer science.... and 2) What will all the american kids that are going to college going to do without adequate financial aid to stay there. 10,500 a year and thats for junior and seniors only. For undergrad first years its something like 4500-6500 aid. THAT BARELY COVERS TUITION AT MOST PLACES. And 10500 barely covers tuition at many. I mean public schools here...even in-state tuition rates.   When are they going to raise the ceiling of available aid and financial need? Tuition goes up EVERY YEAR...why dont the loan amounts go up as well??? We are starting to get out of balance and they arent even doing a damn thing about it. Grrrrr. Plus they need to raise the maximum loan limit, $136,000 total really limits your time in college pending the amount of loans you have needed. Poor people who have needed loans all through college, cant get PhDs as they have maxxed out their spending before they get to that point. And if they up the annual budget bubbles they will have to up the overall budget bubble too. I just hope that this happens BEFORE I get out of school.  Thats all the news in fits of print...
