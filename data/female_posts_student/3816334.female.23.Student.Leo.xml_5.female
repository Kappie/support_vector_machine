Ok so paula ( a lady in my office) just had the most amazing pictures of somewhere near 2nd beach called "hanging rock". *Sigh* sometimes I forget that I live in one of the most beautiful places on this coast. Now all I can think about is buying film and takeing 100's of scenery shots of newport. I have wanted to do that all along but I just never have the time or the energy. Plus Rick is working all the time and without his knowledge of the area I wouldn't even know where to go.   Have you ever gotten that feeling when you get inspired by something, that you might just explode if you don't do it right then. Most of my life is like that  here. there is all this beauty and inspiration and i want to capture it all. But instead i am forced to be tied to a desk all day writing in a weblog instead of experiencing life! ARGH! so not fair. Its a terrible thought but i wish that we worked all day as children instead of wasting time watching tv and playing with doll/trucks, playing "house" or "superheros". All that wasted time, i long for that time back and hate that i may not get it until i am 65 and retired.    thought provoking:   I've seen the rain fall down, And wash away a town, I've seen strong hearts easily broken, Why do some things survive? While others live and die? How can someone let their love go unspoken?  I couldn't stand to see us end up that way, Just another tragedy. Every night I promise another day...  Whatever it takes, I will be there, By your side baby anywhere, When you're lost and alone, I'll bring you home, I will come through, for you, Whatever it takes, Whatever you need, Whatever comes down between you and me, When the road gets rough, You've gotta trust, I will come through, for you, Whatever it takes.              ~Belinda Carlisle               Whatever it Takes
