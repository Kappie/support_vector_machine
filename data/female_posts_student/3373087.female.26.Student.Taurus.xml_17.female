I like studying SA medicine, but I feel like it's interfering with what I really want to do--like spend time with friends (before they forget who I am), hang out with the high schoolers, read, reflect, spend time with B... It's times like these that I appease myself by fantasizing about alternate careers, if you can really call them that.  I feel a list coming on...  Here are some of my fantasy jobs (no particular order): 1) Makeup counter girl at a large department store 2) Housewife/home-maker 3) Waitress at a diner 4) Work retail at a store like Gap or AE, or Bath and Body works.  Just shoot me. Please. Put me out of my misery. If anything is going to drive me to alcoholism, it would be vet school.  Can someone become an alcoholic just by drinking enough Smirnoff Ice?  Since my bladder isn't big enough to drink more than two of those, maybe I'll settle for drowning my sorrows in tapioca pearl tea.  Oh yeah--that would be a cool job too--working at Tapioca Express or at a cafe.  Add that to the list.  Waaaaaaaahhhhh! I'm glad there aren't any matches near me or my syllabus would be up in flames by now.
