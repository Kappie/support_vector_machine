I'm sort of tired right now..last night at Ashley's was a blast. Even though I suck at badminton..right Craig? haha...We watch "50 1st Dates" and it was a funny movie. Today after they sent me home from the REC..I got my paycheck (yeah!)..and then went to McDonald's with my mom and Kyle.  I'm having a family get together tonight instead of seeing Spider Man 2:(. I might see it tommorrow, so you if want to come see with it give me a ring on my cell. Tommorrow I'm working cashier at the REC..so if you want to swim.. visit me there. I have nothing to do during cashier! I wish I could talk to someone...but there's cameras there..and we're supposed to be on the job..right Drew? haha...well...I gotta go..family duties call..See ya!
