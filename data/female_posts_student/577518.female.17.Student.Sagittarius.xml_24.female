I feel blue in this sunny day, when everything outside is bright and I'm blue inside. Somewhere deep down my heart know that I'm not that happy in these few days, but I don't know why? Maybe I'm still can't get used to the enviroment in my new school. I miss my old school, those friendly teachers and the canteen.  Ah, I miss everyone...  *Hugs*
