(i gave him my puppy dog look lol) and he said i dunno danette. so i said i dont kno what else to say other than i was guilty and im so sorry and i hope that we can be friends again. so he said wellll i guess thatll do.so now i think that hes not mad at me anymore and now we can talk on the phone late at night when i have nothing to do! im happy, but i cant get my hopes up cause u never kno he may not call me. he may just have said that to get me to leave but i doubt it, i just hope that he'll call me or if i call him that he'll answer.   so anyways now that thats all out of the way i think life is gettin better slowly day by day. cause it was suckin with the incident at the pool and then ryan bein all bossy towards me and then adam and then havin to go to the grandparents and not bein able to stay home alone. yea its all comin back together, finally. yes i am in a good mood! i just hope that adam doesnt change his mine or somethin stupid like that.  tomorrow i get to go to the pool and do some water drills and show off my mad lifeguardin saving skills lol. that'll be quite interesting since the fact that most of the ppl will prob just fool around most the time. well i get paid to be there so i cant complain. tuesday ill be babysitting for ryan and takin him down to the pool and gettin even more money. then on wednesday i get to babysit nick and make even  more  money lol! thursday im workin the a shift with who knos since that justin is gettin a sub cause hes gonna be outta town now. fri i may have off unless i decide to take allie's position as a sub. shes got mono so she wont be workin til she gets better. sat i work with hilary and then who knos what else i'll be doing. good week of working i have to admit! well i better lay in my comfy bed and watch wither super troopers or office space, i dont kno which one to decide on. im in a good mood! wooooooo blo job betty on the way to rescue u!
