There are days when it seems that I will never be motivated enough to pursue academia and then there are moments where it feels as though I am meant to be nothing but an academic, that scholarship and research will be my life.   The hard part about going to graduate school on a part-time basis is finding the time to live. When you are an undergraduate student, your job is school and your life is a separate entity. When you work for a living and go to school at night, school, suddenly, becomes your life. All other aspects of daily living fall by the wayside and you are plunged into a monotonous routine of work and school, work and school, work and school.   Procrastination, as a result, becomes more than an artform. It becomes as essential to life and breathing air and drinking water. It becomes sex, something that we do not need to survive, but is something that we cannot imagine living without.   Therefore, one could conclude, procrastination is nothing short of fucking with our own self.
