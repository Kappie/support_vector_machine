Hmm, why does every one still believe in perfection, nothing is perfect and if it claims to be perfect then it's telling a lie therefore it isn't perfect. WAKE UP! Sorry, got that off my brothers media project which is really funny! :) :) :) You should watch it some time! (uhh.... yeah...) I'm off to play Monkey Island! Oh, if you want me to blog more, just send hate mail to my brother! :) On second thoughts maybe not!
