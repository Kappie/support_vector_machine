Okay, I don't love John Kerry, but as I've said, ABB-ANYTHING BUT BUSH. So I read it, and it's so obnoxious. So I leave a threatening comment, here it is, beware, it's graphic: YOU SUCK DICK ASSHOLE! WHAT LOSER HAS TIME TO MAKE A BLOG ABOUT HATING JOHN KERRY. WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO FUCKING JACK OFF IN THE CORNER LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO. BUSH IS THE WORST THING TO HAPPEN TO THIS ALREADY SHITTY COUNTRY. GO KERRY AND GO DEMS. I HOPE YOU ROT IN HELL. I don't know what came over me. I mean, it is fine to have your own opinion, but this pissed me off so much. Jesus, who has time to be such a moron?! Anyways, go stalk this loser http://kerryhaters.blogspot.com/.  Besides that, today was the last day of classes. Junior year from hell is finally coming closer to the end. I didn't have a party in any class-that sucked. The school was so quiet since many girls were taking the APUSH test. I went up on stage for announcements, and I see Dr. D and Pryor in the front row. Dr. D waved at me, ahh I was so excited! English was good. We talked and joked. Then we played outside, WITH DR. D! Maria whispered to me, "I wonder what it's like at his house. I bet it's nice. No TV, and everybody just reading a book around the house, sipping lemonade on the porch!" It was so cute! Last math class. Ann and Anna weren't there, which made me really sad! But, I made Rebecca Greenberger sit by me!! AHH I KNOW! Jeanne did too... love those smart sophmores! But I worked problems at the board with Sammy and Nikki. I knew more than I thought I would without studying. USH was good. Chelsea and Kristen showed their presentations. Chem was boring.. Doc didn't let us have any fun. We watched One Fine Day in Spanish, it was boring. Then seventh and eighth I hung out. 7th period, Chelsea and I sat and talked to Se√±or. It was funny, though. We dogged Chair Nazi and discussed the old computer guy who was fired for screwing a student... yeah we all know! After school I saw  13 Going on 30  with Liz. It was just okay. Then we ate at Max  Erma's.. yummy! First off, we had a reservation for 7. So I go in there, and there was the STUPIDEST GIRL I've ever met working! I said, "Hi, we have a reservation for 7, name is Allison". Okay yes I said "for 7" instead of "at 7" but when she saw that "Allison" said "2" and there were only two people there-come on! So she gets confused and is being really annoying. Like, "Where is everybody?" or something. And I was like "no for 2 people, at 7 o'clock!" And she was like .."Ohh see I didn't know!" YEAH, YOU DIDN'T. So she tells us we're second. Then like 10 people get buzzed up and go in. So I walk up to this other girl, and I ask, "HI, we were told we were second, and so many people have gone in before us." And she looks at the list and says, "I thought I paged you." And she takes the pager and says, "Oh the wrong pager number is down!" Yeah, that blonde hostess messed up BIG! So I said, "Yeah that's pretty bad for her!" Then the blondes sits us down and says, "Sorry, things get hectic" EWW DIE! Our waiter was Mike! He wore a girl's cross! He was really bad actually. At the end, he was giving us our change and we started discussing math. Then he turned over my check and wrote down this difficult equation, since he's a junior in college. It was funny. He told us he needed it for meteorology. And Elizabeth asked, "Meteorology? Like Jym Ganahl!" And he said, "Eww, Jym Ganhal SUCKS!" IT WAS SO FUNNY!!! Now I'm home. I'm really tired!!!! EXAMS NEXT WEEK-AHHH! Good luck!
