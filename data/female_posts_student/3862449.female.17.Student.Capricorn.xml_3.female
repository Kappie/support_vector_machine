This list will be exactly the same as the one i made for Dr. Kastner. I am learning to make better judgements about whichreferences to include this time, because often there are more than 100 for a given source. Therefore, i have to pick in choose which ones to use. This task is time consuming, and includes ALOT of copying from the internet and pasting into word documents, but i do get to see some interesting papers. Hopefully Dr. Baum will return today.
