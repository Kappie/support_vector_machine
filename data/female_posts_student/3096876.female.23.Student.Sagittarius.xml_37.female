After not meeting up at the Maddy on Friday, Mike and I had tentative plans for coffee on Sunday.  But Sunday I was recovering, and really just wanted to spend some time at home, by myself.  So we said Monday.  He picked me up promptly in a big red Ram pick-up, with a bag of hockey equipment in the back.  What a guy!    Such a guy's guy.  Gotta be careful with those ones, they tend to pick their guys over their girls.  We went to the Green Bean for a spot o' java, and had some good, though slightly awkward conversation.  Given how...  physical  I got with Tom the other night (luckily I had the presence of mind to not give IT iup to him, ) I'm not sure how this is going to work when I'm dating two guys that are friends.  So I gotta keep it as platonic as possible until I make a decision.  Or if not platonic, at least as PG-13 as possible (coarse language, some nudity...hmm, the possibilities...)  As he dropped me off we made plans for Thursday night.  And I was a little giddy about that!  Eeeee!  So we'll see how that goes.  Tuesday morning I talked to Tom and we made plans to do something on Saturday.  Ky thinks it's gonna be "seyex" but I don't know about that!  The only thing I don't like about Tom is that now that it's Tuesday and we've talked, I can't expect to hear from him again until Saturday.  That's just the way it's been.  But I'm sure I can count on hearing from Mike half a dozen times between now and our next date...  Something else that I am waaaay giddy for is a very special "lunch meeting" I've got set up on Wednesday after my exam.  Around Christmas time, my Aunt Colleen sent me an email saying that if there was anything she could do about helping me network once I graduated to just say the word.  So last week I sent her an email.  "Maybe you can help me with introductions to people in YOUR field.  I'm really more interested in getting into something to do with books.  That should be no surprise, I've wanted to be a writer since... since... I was old enough to write, I think!  I'm really looking for a career that will require (or at least expose me to) a little creativity than the average office job. If you had any idea of anyone that might be willing to take a chance on a  student... I'm intelligent, hard-working, and cute as a button (ok, maybe that  won't sell in the corporate world.)  But I'd be really interested in ANYTHING  you might be able to hook me up with."  And Colleen replied to me, very excited, that she'd be thrilled to meet with me and discuss options.  So I have a date with destiny on Wednesday May 5, at 1 o'clock.  Duhn-duh-duh-dunh!
