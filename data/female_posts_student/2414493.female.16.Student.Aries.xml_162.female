Erum is way cool (for want of a better adjective) but the group presentation just chewed the few pages of Grapes Ch. 19 to death. The one thing that makes me feel absolutely queasy about the subject is overanalysis. In my humble opinion, maybe it's better that we don't find evidence of Grapes parallels with the Communist Manifest, page 478. I'm for holistic reading. BS is good for impressing adults. But coming from students? It's sickening. I have a feeling our presentation also overdoes it, but I can say that it's slightly shorter than 40 minutes. Maybe. I'm proud of our group, though. Doupe and Vince came up with some especially enlightening material, contrary to personal prediction.  Otherwise, I'm so blah right now I have nothing intelligent to say. I'm almost tempted to map out a busy spring break, but I really need to study all of bio AP, which troubles me. I'm more excited about making color-coded USAP notecards, if that makes any sense at all. It doesn't. Forget it. Wednesday is not a day for coherent thoughts. (And I just asked myself, IS IT WEDNESDAY? Yes, it is. I'm not that off track)  I can't even talk anymore. I dropped a take-out box full of rice at dinner. Salvageable, but still annoying. Not in control of my reflexes today.
