There are stupid ones and there are not so stupid ones.  If everyone went around with their faces to the ground not looking at eachother, I can tell you right now that I would not be alive.  I am not trying to sound like a complete bitch or anything, but yes, most of the stuff written in this blog is incredible shallow.  But do you see how lucky you are to have shallow things to talk about?  For the past 2 years of my life I have been in and out of the hospital; recieveing drugs that would kill me if I had only a few grams more.  I would be terrified of someone coughing on me becuase I literally had no immune system to protect me against a simple cold.  I had cancer and everyday I had to deal with it.  The only thing that I wanted was to be normal.  To talk about boys and parties and parents.  I wanted to be a normal teenager, to be treated like a normal teenager.  There were people younger and sicker than me, who I never saw complain about any of the things that were happening to their body.  Yes, we are going to roll over and die someday.  Have you just come to that realization?  I almost died twice.  People make mistakes, several times.  But that doesn't mean they just stop "living."  They go on, they move on, I go on, I move on.  Why don't you keep on living like that?  I hope that you guys don't have to know what it is like to have the incredible desire to be accepted, to be normal, to be shallow.  I know.  And I can tell you that it is one of the worst feelings in the world.  That is why my life is not a waste.  It will never be a waste, because I know what I am supposed to do with it.  I know my purpose.  I hope that you find your life to have meaning.  I'm sorry, but I can't just sit here reading your complaints about how pointless the world is.  I could get REALLY Christian on you, but I won't.  I know that this is probably upsetting you, Josh, that I disagree with you so strongly and I'm sorry, but thats my opinion and it will never change.  I also know that this entire entry is stupid becuase I don't go to your school and deal with the same things, but I hate it when people give up.  I would not be here if I had.  Yes, there is one more person with hope for humanity and that person is me.
