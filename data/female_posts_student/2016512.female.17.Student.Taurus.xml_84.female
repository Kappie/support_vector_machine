Besides working i have, marching band, sports accel, volleyball, dance, and a sr. recital. *sigh* sounds like my east shore afternoons are almost out of sight. but i will still fight for east shore and walks. go walks! i'm going to take advantage of my summer. i'm going to have summer kiss my ass. woot! now i just have to wait for school to be done. *sigh*  watch the seconds go by slowly, -Betso
