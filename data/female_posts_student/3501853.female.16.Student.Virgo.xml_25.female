I was just listening to the new new found glory cd, they're singing my life I tell you, especially failure's not flattering. I hope I hope that I get the Saves The Day tickets today, it's the only thing I have for the summer, except California but that's just for like a week. I really hope Kevin has a decent time, he's so nice for going even though I know he doesn't want to...he's having problems with the band and I really wanna help him cuz I really had a lot of hope for them, I like their lyrics a lot [hehe] but also, the boys are playing so good..but most importantly, kevin was happy with the band..I mean I admit at first, I was upset and hurt that it seemed like he picked the band over our friendship but that was really fucking selfish of me because I love that kid, I mean, the loser keeps me sane lol. I'm glad that he's found something to make him happy, I just wish it wasn't being complicated for him. Here's a quote I read somewhere.."happiness is temporary"..I don't quite agree with it but it is temporary only because life puts us through tests in the way of what makes us happy and we just have to pass them to regain happiness again. I'm starting to clean my room again and argh I gotta go to the chem thing I'll write about this later...Okay I'm back, so I went to that Chem. review thing and all I got was 7 extra credit points and I didn't learn anything at all. I did one problem that took the class a whole hour to do and I gave up after that so me and Liz just talked. We do have a lot of things in common, I feel REALLY stupid for ever being so jealous of her, yeah she's a great person you have no idea but she goes through pain the same way anyone else does and I was immature to hate her for how good she deals w/problems, I'm so happy for her and Dan though. So ya me and her just talked, it was nice. Then at like 11 Sergio gave us a ride home. Now I'm sitting here and I just want sleep but my brain is like on high-speed right now. I'm so frustrated, mainly at myself because I seem so stuck and I don't know where to go. I can take my old route and run away from it all and let things die down in time but that is the cowardly and selfish way of dealing with it and I am so sick of myself doing that. I don't want to be that. But then again, I don't know what to do. It's like everything I try to do or what I do do is like 'eh wrong step camille you just fell further into the hole you've created'. I've come to the point where I see what is wrong with me and all I want to do is fix it but I know the outcome(s) probably won't be good and i miss them sooo incredibly much, i haven't missed people this much since louie but it's like I'm soo thankful for people in my life now a days like I tell everyone online I love you cuz I know it's dumb but the way I see it you have no idea all the bad stuff life will give you or all the bad stuff you will end up doing so while you're at it, you might as well be nice to the people you actually care for because sometimes it might go away or it might be too late forever.In a way Jon was right, I was acting all my life out trying to make my life all perfect that I didn't consider how others felt really, all I cared about was having the people I love around but I wasn't around for them really but I don't want that anymore. I know in my heart it hurts more to see people I love hurt but I never showed or acted upon it. And I hate that but I don't want to hate myself anymore cuz I don't want Kev or ana to be disappointed that I do hate myself lol, I just want to be content I guess. I know I lost those I loved and that is something I can't do anything about but I geuss right now, my first step in all this I think is just to find out who I need to be in order to loook in the mirror and say yeah you screwed your life up but you changed so at least maybe you'll learn your lesson and although you'll be sad the rest of your life for this, you won't hurt anyone anymore for the next what 50 yrs of your life..argh okay now I'm not making any sense and I'm just rambling and I don't even know if this is what I meant or if it came out right, I just need to vent and since no one reads this anywyas, this is a good place to vent to..okay STILL not making sense lol, i'm gonna go sleep now or something..."Why don't you get it together? Failure's not flattering..Can't you see it and you've gone and blown it like everyone thought you would..Show yourself"-nfg
