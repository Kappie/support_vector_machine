I desire something that God hasn't, doesn't, and wont give me. So i have been agureeing through that with  myself. The fact is, i need to be smart... But sadly i have desired to live the way of the world, stupid, unsatfiying, and unwilling... Then theres the way i feel. About myself. Today i had a really really bad attuide, i was just tired. I wanted to get out, do something, anything. Weither pleaseing to God or not... I think thats why i didn't do anything at all. I wasn't trying for my God... Does anyone else go through this... Where you and God are totally awesome, so you really want to keep that relationship good, you read your bible, you pray, you reach, you are the greatest Christian on the plant when your great with God... Yet when you get into a valley, what happens? For me, i try and get a way from God... Dont ask me why. I guess cause somewhere in my mind i deisre to be alittle "bad girl" Yet when i do something "bad", which really is stupid, i feel like i let my Father down.. (Meaning God) I dont know. I tired of being here... Not that i dont love people. Not that i dont want to be with people. But i want to leave...    I have fallen in love with two songs. And one of them is "Beautiful" By Bethany Dillon. I was just listening to it. Am i truly beautiful? Are you? Who can say that? And i dont mean all the make-up, hair, eyes, crap... I mean really am i beautiful? Does my heart shout for joy when someone i truly love finds happiness, when i am stuck here waiting for my God seeking man to find me and tell me that he loves me... Am i truly putting other above myself? Am i being true? There are so many things with beauty... but i dont hold any of them... Why do i talk so low of myself? Cause i know whats inside... Only God and i see what everyone else doesn't see in my heart... I'm sure God sees more then even i do with my heart. But the fact is i'm not a beautiful woman after Christ... But he is a beautiful man after a worthless soul...
