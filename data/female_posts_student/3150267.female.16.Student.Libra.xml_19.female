Silence at first as we stared at her, mumbling someting under our breathes. all of our wanting to be the one who got hold of it. after a fraction of a second or so, it soon turned into screams of happiness. (i think those who had not left sch after 6 would be able to hear some high pitch shouts from us (ms, qt, yihan, dori, yc, hj n me). hehe.) We did it! we finally did it!! haha. the 1000 peice jigsaw puzzle is finally completed after 2 days of struggling n trying to strain our eyes to differentiate black n ... black. haha... i was so happy! ^_^ we hugged each other n congratulations filled e room. arh! i thought we would take at least a wk to finish ms junaidah's wedding present. hehe. (shh... don't tell her, it's suppose to be a secret!) i believe tt without our whole class's team work, we would not be able to finish the puzzle in juz 2 days. yesterday, we spent 5 hrs staring at the puzzle n were still thinking how long it would take to complete. today, we worked for 4 hrs (2-6plus) more n our effort is not wasted. the puzzle looks wonderful. as perfect as any picture could be. it's a scene of a little boy kissing a little gal who was on a train. the hard part wasn't the 1000 peices but rather the boy who was wearing a hat which has the same colour as his trousers n the gal has a bonnet the same pattern (spotted) as her dress!! at first we grumbled, but when the picture was out, our success is certainly sweet. ^_^  i like puzzles. it's a very interesting game where u really need a lot of concentration n patience. at the same time, we can also built bonds thru this as we encouraged each other thruout the whole mind-teasing, eye-straining n hand-stretching "exercise". hehe.   but wat's the consequences? qt n mad swore not to touch jizsaw for 3 years or so. i had nightmare abt it as whenever i shut my eyes, i saw the half done jigsaw in front of me while i tried to fit the pieces in. haha... but it's still so fun. ^__^   ~The greatest discovery is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude...~    ::Patience is a bitter plant but it has sweet fruits.. haha... indeed, we should learn to be more patient n we'll be able to have things done more quickly. Just like our puzzle ^_^...::
