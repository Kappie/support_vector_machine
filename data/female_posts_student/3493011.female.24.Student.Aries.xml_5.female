Terence will definitely be shaking his head when he read this but ahhhhhhhhh... I am a really disappointing student...  Much to say now I hav to push myself even more to cover my grounds in case she starts asking me qns... I can sense that I hav slack alot since my honours year started...I feel I'm not up there in terms of my theories and my research.. I feel that I hav not put in as much effort.. hmm.. I dread winter cos it doesn't give you the occassional umph in life.. makes u wanna sleep more, laze more, eat more and yah u basically dun wanna go out or do ya wrk... I find it hard to motivate myself to head down to uni and into lib to do research and juz spend a whole day there... tomolo I muz drag myself into uni..IT IS A MUST! yah then maybe go swimming as a reward...now I'm still awaiting for Audrey's reply to my meeting tomorrow... dunno if she wanna see me..  Even if she doesn't also good lah.. then I can do more research... hee hee
