You know, the usual stuff, talking to hott boys on the internet, having all my friends over, turning off all the lights and having sex all night. same old, same old. Sara has a blog now http://johnnydepps_loveslave.blogspot.com. Yep, and i'm going to help her hook up the old A-I to the M and then she'll be fawesome and good to go. I wanted to spend the night with her and Rach tonight, but i just didnt know if all of us could get ready in time for practice in the morning. We'll definately do something fun during our two hour break between practices. It's taken me two hours to write five sentences. I forgot what I was even going to say. Um, the show is going good. Just had a bad day the other day, made a retarded mistake, not worth all the fuss I made about it. That's what comes with being a girl, MELO-DRAH-MATIKS..ugh. But anyway, I babysat today. Woke up 10 minutes before I was supposed to be there and decided I didnt feel good enough to go, but I did anyways. So while I was there, Emily shit in her potty chair TWICE and I had to clean it up both times. I'm going to start charging extra by the size and smell of the shit. I figure that will make me a big profit. Nah, I'm just kidding. Then I went to practice for a few hours, and then went to eat at Zaxby's with some people from practice afterwards. That was fun. Those guys are so hilarious, I could not stop laughing. And I've been talking to Daniel and Kim on the internet, while I have gotten so tired I've forgotten all the details of my day. The End.
