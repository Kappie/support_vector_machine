I've been with Sarah these last couple of days and therefore haven't been able to acess my point charts at home.     Ah yes. Sarah's making me blog. Therefore, it's time for........*drumroll*.......our dday in Kokomo.YAY!  Okay, Friday I went with Sarah and Mrs. M. to Kokomo to visit Sarah's relatives and to shop. Well, we first went shopping and Sarah bought a plethera of outfits, and I bought a very cute evening dress. (Although, I now have no where to wear it. lol. Ah well. C'est la vie.) I really like it though. Then we went to Sarah's Aunt's and Uncle's house to visit them. We stayed for a while and talked. We also watched home movies. Not just any home movies. Home movies of Sarah as a baby!!!! One word: AAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!! We saw her go up and down steps and play in the pool, (I know, Sarah enjoying being in the pool! lol) her halloween as a bunny when her ears kept falling down, and we saw her love of rocking chairs and chocolate. At one point she carried a bag of chocolates around the house and wouldn't let them go. She was so cute though!!!!! (Sarah, embarrased yet??) That's where I am going to leave it though. (Otherwise Sarah might raid my house for baby videos, lol. )    Today I went to church and then went to lunch with the rest of my family. Much fun. But not. Ah well.   Got oboe reeds. yay......joy.....I really need to pick that thing up again though. I also got a flute music book of Les Mis. Interesting. Keeps me busy. :-D Ah well, that's all for now.    "Shall we go to bed?"
