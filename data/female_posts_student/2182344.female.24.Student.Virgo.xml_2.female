I went to the Dr. on Tuesday, and he said that it could be the acid in my stomach backing up into my esophagus (sounds so pretty, doesn't it?).  I have to go to the UK hospital and get some xrays on Monday morning.  Hopefully I'll find something out soon after that.  I don't think it's the acid back up thing, because my back is effected.  I'm really worried about what it is.  Hopefully, it's something simple that can be taken care of easily.  Went to Logan's first birthday on Tuesday as well.  Of course, he didn't really know what was going on.  It was cute though.  As all one-year-olds should on their first birthday, he participated in the tradition of smearing his cake all over himself.  Connor is his big brother, and everyone ended up buying him some gifts as well, since it's the first time that another kid in the house has had a birthday.  I wonder what he's going to think next year when he doesn't get any presents on Logan's birthday.  It was really cute though.  He was soooo excited and hyper.  He probably felt like it was his birthday.   My class began today.  It's going to be rough sitting through 2.5 hours of algebra three times a week, but at least it will be over in six weeks, instead of nearly six months.    We leave for TN a week from tomorrow.  It would be really nice if this little health problem that I'm dealing with would subside while I prepared for the trip.  I have soooo much to do!!  I'm going to Cynthiana tomorrow to swim.  It's sooo nice having a pool available whenever I feel like swimming.  Of course, it does mean that I have to drive to Cynthiana, but it's usually well worth the trip.    That's all for now.
