Because I am a christian, I don't want to be like everyone else. I  want people to wonder what is different about me. A difference.  I want to make a change, I want to touch lifes.  I don't just want to be popular or pretty.    Everyone doesn't have to like me.  Guy don't have no fall in love with my smile.  If I was the only one in the world who loved me, I would feel wonderful, because I have God.  I would keep going.  Never stop.   Laura
