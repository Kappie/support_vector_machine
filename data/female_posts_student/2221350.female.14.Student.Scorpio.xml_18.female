My grandmother wouldn't leave me alone and I was already upset from all this morehead stuff going on and mom leaving and being gone all night. But she kept on pushing me and messing with me and I just couldn't stand it anymore. So I started crying and sobbed quietly through the writing of my whole research paper.   I think I will call mom and make her come get me before I have to go to French. I really dread going to that class every single day. When I wake up in the morning, I think "Shitt, in 7 hours and 30 mintues i have to go to French". The teacher is nuts, the method is nuts, and our class is so ornery and dumb it seems like we learn the same thing every day. Plus the teacher ((Madame Harris)) is really loud and freaky.   I hate iMacs, they are so ((and I never use this word with a negative connotation)) gay...  Bell just rang, must be leaving to go play volleyball.
