I think we are just having bad luck for the past month or so. Anyways we were sitting outside at the smoking corner. Yes we have a smoking corner because the university people said that too much smoke was getting into the buildings. Whatever! Anyways on with the story. As I said we were at the smoking corner when the fire alarm went off at the  urlLink Harrington Hall.   Then we seen people come out of that dorm dressed in their PJ's on. About 5 minutes later these two firemen came up to us and asked us where Harrington Hall is. What was that about??? STU is like the smallest university in Canada I think. STU has 4 offices and classroom buildings. Four residence buildings and one is off campus and a fitness center. That's 8 buildings on campus and one off campus. Plus the alarm was going off.   How could they not know which building??? I didn't mine telling them but its kind of stupid when all the people came out of that building and standing right there outside in front of Harrington hall. Anyways it was a weird morning. I am going to my parents house for the long weekend. So have a great weekend! I know I will. Happy thanksgiving!
