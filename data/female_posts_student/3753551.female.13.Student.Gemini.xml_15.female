Usually when its the hols, i just sleep and eat and grow arse and then i get depressed cos im so FAT. but not now! Im going to a coffee festival tomoro... although if i dont invite someone fast, im going to be going by myself. either that or ill ask mum to come with me. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . but i think ill probably get someone to come...  Our lil band thing is now a current issue... nothing has really been done about it. We have a bassist, kate, and a guitarist, me, and another guitarist, jess, and supposibly another guitarist, elena, but i havent spoken to her for a good while and god knows what the fuck is happening with her. If she decides not to decide, we have back ups... just random, random, random people who we just happen to know who just happen to play the guitar...justin, rob, some dude which ive never met (by the way im starting to say dude which is, in my books, NOT GOOD) and also this dude in yr 7 who apparently has hair like matt bellamy was meant to be a drummer, apparently kate knew him or somthin. i dont know. but annnnyway.   If you know me and are in the sydney area, contact me so i can stalk you.   there is NOTHING TO FLIPPIN DO ON THE COMP ANYMORE!!!!!! nobody is ever online! i think its cos they have lives or something i dont kno. lives are overrated if you ask me.  but like you would.  What is life? A journey to death with arcade games on the way? pff that was stupid wasnt it. and i thought i was poetic. i guess not. LEts make up a poem right here right now.   There once was a man called Greg  Who liked rice pudding with nutmeg.  He sat on his ass, alone in the grass  Eating and getting a cramp in his leg.   how was it?  hows this?   Jess. jess.  has lots of zest.  accepts nothing less  than the absolute best.   how was it?  hows this?   Kates gonna kick me off the comp now  Because she is such a mean old cow.  No im only joking.  Ive started smoking  She just hit me....ow   she didnt actually it was just the only thing that rhymed. and shes not a cow eitha. ok? ok
