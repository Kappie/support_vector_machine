It's recycled plot which included the recycled idea of having a young child repeat a "confusing and mysterious" phrase was a little too "blah" for me. Stars Dennis Quaid, Sharon Stone and Juliette Lewis couldn't help the disastrous writing. With bizarre bits in it made to be frightening they just suceeded in making me think...."wow, this movie is pathetic" The overall plot could be summed up: Man  wife find house, house has been taken by bank, previous owner was in jail, previous owner mad that man  wife have house, previous owner tries to scare people out of house..."but why?" I admit it sounded good but it proved to be a recycled plot with minor adjustments.   *******SPOILER ALERT****** Newsflash the old throw the dead bodies down an abandoned well, has been done, remember a little movie called The Ring? They did it. Calling the well the "Devil's Throut" doesn't make it any more mysterious!
