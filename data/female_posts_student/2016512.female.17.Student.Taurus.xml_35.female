I went into work for six hours, and was instructed to go home and take Wednesday off, too, since there's nothing for me to do.  *knocks on wood*  This is quite the blessing in disquise.  I wanted a couple extra days to add to my vacation, and I got just that!  Woot woot woot for me!  So, I semi-finished cleaning my room today.  Everything's back where it's supposed to be (minus my newly acquired college stuff, of course) and I have some of my recpetion poster boards up in place of all the little teenibopper posters I used to have.  I put all of the "Academic Letter Award" and "RYLA Recipiant" awards in a nice little binder, and I have my chief prom pictures in nice frames.  I put all of my Beanie Babies (which were taking up space in the bottom drawer of my dresser) in a cardboard box and stuck it in the closet, then I put all of my un-first place skating trophies and put them in that bottom ex-Beanie Baby drawer.  You know, it's kind of a sad day when you box up your Beanie Babies and seal them with packing tape.  *zip*  It's like sealing your childhood aspirations into an airtight box, so no one will know that you once had little, 11-year-old dreams... and really big glasses.  Depressing really... oh well.  *straps on thigh-high boots*  One thing scares me though... all things things of the past I've dug up... what does that mean about the future?  *grumble*  Two bitchin' posters for the shipping of one, Manda
