Then when it was released for DVD rentals, we rented and watched it again at that time also. And guess what. He got it as one of his Christmas presents.    I took the day off today to clean the house. We are having company over. It's feeding time at Brian and Ching's. You all know how much we've come to love entertaining. We are a couple of suzie-homemakers. Richard and I are making chicken  pork adobo. And I am making pork sinigang with leafy stuff (I don't know what it is called, I normally don't eat vegetables)  bamboo shoots. I even borrowed my mom's big rice cooker so we'd have enough rice for everyone! We'll take some pictures.. After all, this is our first official get-together for 2002. I'll have to post it in my personal blog.
