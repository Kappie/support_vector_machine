I have done a lot of thinking about this and I now feel that I am ready to discuss the thoughts and feeling that I have been having. This concerns a certain person and I will keep the name of this person private in order to protect them. But I want to make it clear that this concerns all of my friends who read my blog and it is important for all of you to read this now because I am not going to type this again.  Well let me just start off by saying that what I write in here and on my webpages are "MY" thoughts. That is why I titled this blog "My Thoughts!!!!" This is just a place for me to write down what I am thinking and my feelings for the day. If for some reason you make it into my blog and you don't like what you have read then you need to understand that this is me RAW!!! I do not censor myself in here because I rarely censor myself in public. I speak what is on my mind as well as write it that way. I am trying to keep this blog as true to my personality as possible and that includes my sarcastic personality. In order for someone to be my friend they have to understand that side of me. I come across very brassy at times but it only comes from the fun, sarcastic side of myself. My friends can not be sensitive and at times they must have a thick skin to be around me. I expect for my friends to throw the comments back in the same fashion that I dish it. This is a very important trait for my friends to have. At one time I had a longtime friend who couldn't not handle this side of me and I found myself walking on eggshells just to be around her. I WILL NOT do that again!!! In the end we ended our close to 15 year relationship badly, which tells me that walking on eggshells never works in a true friendship. I will not and can not change this side of myself and if that hurts your feelings than maybe I am not the kind of friend that you need. I am not saying this to be mean or cruel. I am just saying this to be very honest. I love my friends very much and I would never do or say anything to intentionally hurt them or their feelings. BUT... The simple fact is that my sense of humor is sometimes a lot to swallow and it takes a strong person with a lot of self confidence to handle it. This is why I only surround myself with strong people who can take it as well as they dish it. Lastly, before I close this blog for the night I want to make it clear that this entry isn't intended for just one person, it is for everyone. In order to make people happy I have changed somethings in here as well as my webpage, but I will NOT ever be doing that again. JUST REMEMBER these are my thoughts and this is who I am. If you can't handle that then don't read my blog!!!   Also one more last thing, (and this IS for that one person who will remain nameless) before you fly off the handle over two little words please read the content around those words. My thoughts lie in the paragraph and not a word. I can sometimes be a little long winded but you will find that although I choose every words very carefully, it is the message that is important and not the words used. I have decided that this is the last time that I will discuss this issue with you because I feel that if it is a blog that is most important to you, then I will use this blog to communicate my feeling to you. Obviously when I say "I love you" in real life it doesn't matter as much as what is written online. Try to think about what I have written in here because these are the facts and they will not change in the future. I do love you very much but do not ask me to change who I am because I have never asked you to change things about yourself. If you can't handle me then maybe we weren't as close as I originally thought.
