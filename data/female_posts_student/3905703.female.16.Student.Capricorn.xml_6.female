I think this is the reason why i had been a bit touchy for the last few days. Soumya is the one who has actually gone throughmy mood swing (as she sits with me and happens to be a great friend of mine).Anyhow, yesterday in the break there was nobody in the class (everybody had gone to increase their Maths marks, Kathuria gave the corrected papers on 16th). So I was trying to do some organic questions when Kanika (another great friend of mine) came in. Kanika made me go for a walk with her. And I think that made things more clearer to me. I talked to her abt the difficulties which I was facing and she made me realise that I wasn't the only one who was facing the problems.Everybody has to go through it. I mean most of us. Those who dont have to are lucky. But anyhowI have decided that I will give it my best shot and then whatever happens is my destiny and I will accept it without any regrets.  I know nobody noticed it (neither did I want anybody to kno) but I was really in a sullen mood and feeling very down. That's why in the first place I thought of writing a blog.The rains and the talk have helped in making it a lot better, actually I think it is back to normal. Also writing about it has helped.  So my dahling Soumya I wont stop you from laughing on jokes, I will laugh with you .
