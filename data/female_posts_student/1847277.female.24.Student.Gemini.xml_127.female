I guess tonight I'm going out to dinner with Natalie (the friendly Canadian) and John.  I'm really tired tho, so I'd almost prefer just to stay in and have a cup o' noodles.  Plus, I have to do laundry.  So if I go out, I either have to stay up late doing laundry, or come in later tomorrow morning in order to do it then.  But John won't approve of that since I came in late yesterday and we're going to someone's house for lunch tomorrow.  Phooey.  So I guess it's a late night to me. Hmm.  What's up with Madonna changing her name to Esther?  Or did she just take an additional name?  I guess that's probably what it was.  But Esther?  Geez. Ah, okay.  I'm going to go back to work.  I hope I have some emails tomorrow.  Today I didn't have any.  Well, one that Matt sent last night.  But nothing new popped up during the day, which is always sad and depressing.
