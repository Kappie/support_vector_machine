Err yeah, and I really want to keep the last blog at the top of the page *blushes* don't get me started on that again! Hmm... ohh and now I've gone and forgot all that useful crap I could have told you! (*sarcasticly or however you spell it* it? Oh yeah, and we  really really REEEALLY  wanted to hear about it!) Grr... Any way, we're back at school now! Ahh heck that's annoying. But hey, Izzy isn't that bad really ;) Hehe, just get her fuming! OHH YEAH! Now I remember the point! (You DO!) Yeeah! I found out some thing cool! On the task bar, at the right we have this button and if you click on it then it shows the desktop! I never knew that before and I've had this computer for aaaages! Duh! Well erm... ours is by the 'Launch Outlook Express' button, and funnily enough, if you hover over it, it says 'Show Desktop' I mean WOW! Like who's gonna get that! Don't worry if you're lost right now, it'll only take you a few years to learn!
