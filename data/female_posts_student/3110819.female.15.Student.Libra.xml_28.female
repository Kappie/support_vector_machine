I always liked the show before, but man, I am crazy obsessed w/ watching it now.....hmmm possibly blow money on dvd sets?....  anyway, taekwondo sucked tonight.  we spent practically the whole time doing our forms for the whole class, which, gotta say, I get practically nothing out of because I'm always the highest rank.  I was the only chick in class tonight, as is most nights. I don't usually mind, but marlyn was gone too. arghhh. (but I can still kick all the guy's buts...hehe)  I finally did some practicing today on my clarinet. and found out I forgot a ton of my scales. CRAP!!! now I have to relearn them! *mutters*  not much else going on...of course when school starts I'll be so busy my head will explode....but anyway.....later
