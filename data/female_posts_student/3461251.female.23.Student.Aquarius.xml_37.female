If I am, I'm lossing it everywhere but my ass and hips. None of my old cloths are fitting me - STILL. Although, my cloths are becoming loser though and my bras fit very odd.   Second off - Josh! I'm totally confused when it comes to him. He goes off to Russia and doesn't even say good-bye to me, which to be honest was really hurtful. He says his cable went out friday night yet Shay says he didn't prepare for the trip very well and was running around crazy. Then to top all this off he says a bunch of things before he leaves that leads me to believe that were something more then friends but sometimes it just doesn't feel that way.   I can't help but to adore him so much. He's one of the most amazing guys I've met in awhile and he actually supports me, even through stupid shit and not so safe shit. I just wish I knew what he wanted but I'm to chicken shit to ask, in fear its something I don't want to hear but deep down I know that he cares a great deal.   Third off - My mom is sick. They have no idea what is wrong even after the MRI and catscans! Her eyes look like someone beat the shit out of her and they blame it on blood pressure? What-the-fuck-ever! She gets dizzy and falls down - She eats and pukes. Hmmm yeah that's just blood pressure. Stupid ass doctors. Ugh.  Fourth off - Why do I keep meeting so many freakin FAKE friends? They use you long enough to get what they want and then POOF?! Ever since I had surgery, it's like people forgot my name. I really don't understand - It's not like I changed my personality or I'm asking for special attention. I just want you to treat me like the same ol Katie! I haven't changed!
