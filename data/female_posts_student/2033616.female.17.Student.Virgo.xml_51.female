I can start my essay tomorrow i guess.  Well today we decorated for Christmas.  I love Christmas, it's my favorite holiday in the whole wide world except maybe for Groundhog Day.  I dunno, that thrill of excitment i get when i'm waiting to find out if Punxsutawney Phil (that's the groundhog's name for those of you who arn't as culturaly refined) saw his shadow or not... wow it's special.  Wow, "how many days till Febuary 2nd daddy?"  So as I was saying, I didn't do much today.  Except clean my room.  That was good, i consider it a personal victory over the lazy day.  Last night was the Madrigal Dinner which was very very fun.  Although i would have to say that last year's was a tid bit better, this one was just as much fun!  Afterwards MK and i stopped by Chad's to wish him a happy birthday for the bazillionth time since i gave him his present.  We didn't stay long.  Then Sean met me outside of the house to meet Jamie and Lindsey.  Then Kayla and Renae showed up, and it was a nice little party on a sidewalk in freezing temperatures.  It was great fun.  Then we headed over to my house so mk and i could change and i could put on shoes that didn't bind my feet.  (I need to stop staying "then")Kayla and Renae split at some point so MK and Sean and I went to Barnes and Noble without them.  We saw Lumer, who is growing a beard for Le Mes and looks like he's about 26 now, no joke.  Conversation consisted of Disney Channel and Sean's haircut (MK is now his style consultant) a winning combination.  Then we went home and i slept.  I slept and i slept and i woke up and all the sleepyness was gone!!! what a concept.  I should take note of that... more sleep= less sleepiness... why doesn't it work like that the rest of the week?  Oh that's right.. b/c i'm a slave to my homework.  I'm procrastinating right now, I'm supposed to be writing my essay on American reform movements... i'd rather eat dirt.  But i leave you now... i think we have some potted plants upstairs....
