I dragged myself out into the driveway at the disgustingly early hour of 10 AM (shut up) and opened the car door. Unfortunately I got distracted by something, turned around too fast, got my purse strap stuck to the door, lost balance and fell spectacularly ass first into the car. Of course, the passing group of neighborhood children erupted into laughter making it even more embarrassing. Thanks a buttload karma...  I was bleaching my hair again this afternoon, mostly to fix the monstrosity of a color my friends have dubbed "retro 70's couch". Did you know hair dye has nonoxynol-9 in it? Yup, I routinely cover my head in spermicidal lubricant. *Grins* Ain't that special? No? Well it's been a really slow couple of weeks...  My dad was prancing around all morning talking about getting somebody "all roofie'd up and shit". I worry about him some days. He recently proclaimed himself the village pervert. He's also threatened a few of his buddies with anal rape... That man is definitely on something, god I wish he would share.  Goodnight. I might actually try to sleep tonight. :)
