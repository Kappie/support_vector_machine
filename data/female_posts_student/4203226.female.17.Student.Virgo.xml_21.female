(My mom was going to Oshawa so she brought down some of my stuff) I mean, my room is now free of all the good trinket stuff, and some of my clothes, shoes....my fridge, that sort of stuff, ahs already made the journey that is still ahead of me. Let me tell you, packing up the car is a sad thing to do...anywaz, i just thought i would share.
