When I need you most, your gone I believe That I was decieved And that you came relieve  me of this fear inside Ive been pulled down Finally Your voice Echoing in my head So I sit, on the floor I cant wait anymore For you  It cant be over now Ill find a way, somehow Im losing me And I cant feel Anything real Anymore
