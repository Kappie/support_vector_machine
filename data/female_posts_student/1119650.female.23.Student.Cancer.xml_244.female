One would be all chicken skin (after all, any avid chicken eater knows the skin is the best part)  it would offer all various flavors of skin (garlic, butter, brown sugar, chive, dill, etc) I dunno what I'd call it though.  The second place would be called "Gwen's Feed Bag".  It would be a fast food restaurant serving things foil lined bags which include a mish mash of ingredients (similar to a Cornish Pastie...for my UK readers, only with out the yummy, flaky crust).  There would be all kinds of meals: chicken nuggets and fries, fried shirmp and veggies, different kinds of stews and other hearty meals.  It would make millions I say...millions.  My slogan would be "Come to Gwen's Feed Bag and Put your Face to the Sack".  Goddamn, I'm a marketing genius.
