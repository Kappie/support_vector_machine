And imagine the look on MC's face if you make it...I would pay...ok, not too much at all, perhaps five cents if it happened to be on hand, because she is worthless filth?!?...but there would be money and a Polaroid all over that one. And a shotgun.  "I can't believe it! Mr. Compton, there must be some mistake!" (pale and aghast, eyes filled with over-pouring tears and malaise) "No mistake you whiny whore, Abby's it for this part...I don't even know why I kept picking you all this time, I think you must have put drugs in my drinks or something, you sound like a cow in heat being eaten alive by a pack of rabid chihuahuas, and your acting reminds me of the last time I went to the monkey cages at the zoo. Abby's hitman boyfriend, come take out this trash." (looking up from butchering Jerry, a clicking of shotgun shells) "Hurray. Fun." (with absolutely no expression or tone) (laughter resounding thereafter)  And if not that, we could always take to being verbose about everyone's being stupid, especially ________ (insert high school career-dramatist/gay liar drama department guy here).  So I would say yes, Abigail McLemore, it's worth a shot.   Ha ha ha. Shot. Someone's in a sadistic mood tonite.
