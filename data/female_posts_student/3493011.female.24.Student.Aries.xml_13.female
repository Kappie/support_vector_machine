I saw tt Tassie tix aren't expensive flyin on Jetstar.. I mite try to save as much this hols so I can catch 2 wks there I hope...muz find email address...hope to do so this wk I muz make an effort to remember..  Since baby is not ard, I mite juz catch sometime out in the country of Tassie.. not confirm though but I'll try... Tassie is like Perth quite and laid-back... the weather can be extreme now in winter..but Uncle Frank has been amazing..I was initially afraid of him cos he looks fierce but after the week at convention, he left such a lasting impression.. man of few wds but always so understanding to us youngsters neber seem to mind our nonsense... I mean real nonsense tt can irritate even myself sometimes...  Tassie sounds good ya... I mite do a double entry today... there's something else tt I wanna jot down..something tt's hard to do..
