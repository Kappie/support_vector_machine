I'll let you know after it happens, but lets just hope I make it.  In exactly 15.5 hours it will be 2 months until my birthday.  Get ready to get your party on, childrens.  I'm thinking a bar crawl spectacular...details to come later.    Everything was pretty fun this weekend.  I enjoyed a yummy dinner with my fellow angels Farrah  Lucy and afterwards we all hung at Finn's for a bit.  Saturday the weather was absolutely AMAZING.  The boy and I headed out to Long Island and saw his new puppy, Harley, who is the CUH YOO TEST thing I have ever seen.  Dinner at Black Bear wasn't as good as it usually was because we had the biggest crackpot of a waiter.  I watched Kill Bill again (to think I'd almost forgotten just how HARD it rocked my ass the first time!) and I'm highly anticipating getting out to see part 2 this week or weekend.  The sun is shining again today, there are just a few more hours to go and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I'm gonna leave you guys with a good song (no, there is no hidden meaning behind it...it was just the last thing I heard on my way outta the house this morning and this blog needs more Goldfinger!)  "I run away  'Cause I'm scared that you might leave There's nothing wrong, But that's not what I believe. Just tell me it's alright And tell me I'm okay And tell me that you're  Staying here tonight.  I feel stupid saying Words you've heard before. The way I feel today Is all I know for sure And if I scare you I'm only scaring me. I've got so much to say Why won't you speak with me? I need to know  What you're feeling Do you feel like I do? Let's talk about everything, I want to share my life with you And tell me that you feel The way I feel tonight And tell me that you know This feels right  If you're in my life Well I want to be sure I'm not wasting time I've been through this before"
