Whether I'm off on my bicycle (or pony) exploring, lost in a good book, or giggling with my best friend, I live in a world apart, one full of adventure and wonder and other stuff adults don't understand.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I have also been informed that if i was to be in a movie it would be tarzan b/c "i am a very curious and well mannered person! Big things are always happening to mw.  i can adapt quickly to any situation and am very loyal to the ones i love"
