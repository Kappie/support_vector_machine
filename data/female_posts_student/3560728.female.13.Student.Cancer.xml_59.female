It makes me feel all nostalgic for a generation I was never part of, if that makes any sense, which it probably doesn't. My head is spinning...The blinds are flapping and everything is making me think of the lyrics to Kansas. Because a fiva and a half our drive might as well take days, you know?? I have 7 days to go here and I'm going insane. Yes, I was already insane, but now it's 25 times worse. I've listened to all of my CD's and cried to the Goo Goo Dolls the way I always seem to. It's impoaaible to exlpain why. I need to stop being like this...
