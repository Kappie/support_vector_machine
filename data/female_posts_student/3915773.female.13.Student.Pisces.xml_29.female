In the article, it describes the ordre by the new Iraqi government to reopen a paper closed by American order. "The closing was a catalyst for some of the worst anti-American mayhem of the occupation," the article says. This issue of freedom of the press obviously matters to Dr. Allawi, who ordered the reopening, and to the Iraqis who launched "anti-American mayhem" after the paper was closed. The anger shown toward Americans when they closed a paper down amazes me since the Iraqis have lived for so long without freedom of the press. The reopening of the paper is a sign of the U.S. letting the Iraqi interim government make decisions, even if they are contrary to previous American decisions. It just shows how much the power has shifted.
