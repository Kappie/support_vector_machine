My brother was 'fishing' the whole night, lf you play computer games, it will be Jing Yong, a chinese visual computer game where you fight your way through like a swordsmen into caves and stuff like that. Oh, anyway, yesterday I had bio remedial from 3 to 4.30pm. I tell you, I felt so downgraded. My bio teacher was like pointing at us like PIGS "You, stay. You, go!" Those stay, stay back for remedial and that means that you are poor in Bio. But of course, no hard feelings. I just do not like the way my teacher picked up students but anyway she is quite a good teacher though our former teacher went for further studies in overseas. -__- Oh and then when I reached home, I had to rush to the hairdresser where I had a appointment with the hairdresser to rebond my hair. In other words, it means straightening of hair. The process was long but worthwhile, it lasted for 3 hours but the hair will be kept straight for 6 months. Actually, I rebonded my hair when I was in sec 2, that was the time where rebonding was very very popular. Now I think it is cheaper (i will not reveal the price or location :p) But this time, my hair is straighter than before, I am always anti- chemicals, anti- hair- drying, anti- colouring of hair (although I did it a few years back) AND anti- everything that was put on my hair! But why the change? Hmm... I thought my hair was like a birdnest and even if I used the Dove's shampoo (think commercial and ad.), my hair is still like *__* Enough about hair. Today, I had chem practical. And I was doing an experiment on iron(II) oxide reacting with HCl. I am supposed to close the rubber bunk and shake the mixture. Stupidly, I IMMEDIATELY close the bunk. And what happened??? There was a loud "POP" sound, just like a champagne bottle. And all the black solution splashed not on me but everywhere on the table. Jeezz... So much for being ANTI- CHEMICALS. Today, GB girls (sec 3) supposed to set up a mini stall to promote their stalls which will be officially set up after exams in Bishan Junction 8 (all singers and actors will go there to promote their album, etc..) But unfortunately, they forgot to lock up the GB room after taking in or out the items they should be selling, BOOM! Our officer was so angry she gave them a scolding (LOUD!), no, it is scoldingS, with a S. So now the sec 3's could not set up and promote their stall as our officer disallowed and they were black- faced the whole day -__- Well, they already deserved their punishment, so I hope they would be more careful the next time. Jeezzz x2.... Enough x2 of that, had a maths remedial today from 4 to 5.30pm. Yesterday's activities tired me out and it was overlapped and brought forward to today, so adding x2 of stress and tireness. Luckily tomorrow is Vesak day, if not, I will really think of not going to school. Not much activities for tomorrow, but just sort of laze around studying and trying to snatch a moment to confide in here (brother went out AGAIN)
