Right now I have my laptop out in front of the tv so I can watch the Bachelorette Reunion and type stuff up. I need to write a paper propsal tonight, and a response for my seminar--for the first time ever I did the reading ahead of time, so I don't have to stay up all night trying to get through the reading. But I might have been more into the reading this week because it was a comic book,  Maus  by Art Speigelman, and it was awesome. I tell you, this was the most interesting and easy reading I've ever read.  So I'm going to start a bigger knitting project than I've ever attempted before, and I think I'm going to do a project diary of it... I'll keep you posted!
