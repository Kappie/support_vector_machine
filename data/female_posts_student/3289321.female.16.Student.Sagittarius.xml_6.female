Anyway..after I get out of here, me and Meg are gonna hang out for the rest of the day.  Bo's having a birthday party at the Y at 5, and then after that, Meg and I are going to Atlanta Bread to meet some people.  :)  It'll be cool.  You know, this is my last day ever at Foard.  Most of the people here won't ever cross my mind again.  But there are a few that I won't ever forget...and it's going to be the hardest thing I've ever done to leave them.  They know who they are.    And even though the moment passed me by I still can't turn away I saw the dreams you never thought you'd lose tossed along the way Letters that you never meant to send lost or thrown away And now we're grown up orphans that never knew their names Don't belong to no one that's a shame You could hide beside me maybe for a while and I won't tell no one your name I won't tell em' your name Scars are souvenirs you never lose , the past is never far Did you lose yourself somewhere out there , did you get to be a star Don't it make you sad to know that life is more than who we are You grew up way too fast and now there's nothing to believe And reruns all become our history A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio and I won't tell no one your name I won't tell em' your name I think about you all the time But I don't need the same It's lonely where you are come back down, and I won't tell em your name ^Goo Goo Dolls - "Name"  Later  >
