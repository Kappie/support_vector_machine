That and I will not have the urge to sleep thus makeing it harder to study. My Robyn said that my math final will be pretty easy. I'm hopeing she's right. I mostly have to study for chapters 5-8 out of nin. I'm just going to breeze past 1-4 and do a quick review of nine. 6 should be ok because I pretty much get it. Maybe I should do some mandarin work now. Work on stabalizing a B for myself in that class.   I have found more reasons why my ortho is evil. These stupid wires on my bottom set of teeth are sticking up after I tried to floss, it sucks, and is totally pokeing me.   Yay about my science final though. Exept for the electron, proton, neutron, issue I think I may get a B/A. I'm a good student I'm just a bad test taker. I get really nervous. Hopefully though it'll be ok I mean there were only like five questions on that and then of course I'll get like ten wrong on princable, and then an additional ten as wild cards, that I knew but either changed or printed in inncorrectly. So that leaves me with a deffinate 75% ... I may get more, but I can garuntee at least 75%. Well it's better than a fail.   It's funny. My parents don't beat me up about my homework nearly aas much as I beat myself up. Good news though, I'll be getting more than 93.2% in foods class. That brings me from a C+ in term one, to a B in term two, to an A in term three. That should give me at least a high B avarage. My English average should be crazy good. I'm very worried about my textiles mark though I think I have about three zeros. Luckily in Textiles I have a 90% on one of the majore projects and a high B on another. As well my samples are pretty good. As is my journal. I think I should get at least a C+ for this term or, at least I hope so.   Raven's party prep is going well, I would say more but she may stumble onto this little blog and that would be a tragity if she learned too much too soon.   Well I'm going to do my mandarin homework now, I may post in about 40 minutes... I may not. Who knows... I will deffinatly post later though.
