I can't wait because it is so frustrating not knowing what he wants, like if he's hungry or too full...AHhhhhh!  Shawn  Nick are embarking on a shopping adventure right now. They are on their way to McDonalds for salads, and then to Target. This is Shawn's first time taking Nick out all by himself. GOOD LUCK SHAWN! Today, Nick  I visited Grandma Lu at the Police Station for a minute  Nick got lots of kisses!  -Grandma Lu works as an investigator for the Duluth Police Department.-
