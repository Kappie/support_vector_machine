I'm really excited to go and see her.  Summer school has started and Bob, the drummer/co-writer/backing vocals for my band,  urlLink Stericks , and three more of my good friends are all going to be at my college's research facility, which is located right by my home! It's great, I have stuff to do on the weekends! They are crazy busy during the week, they are taking a years worth of class in three weeks or some ungodly deal like that.  Anyway, summer is ok, it's so much better than last year. So I'm grateful.  I miss everyone who I can't see. You all mean a lot to me!
