Thursday was a small piece of hell right here on earth. 48 kids in Second and Third grade all massively grouped and raising their own inner demons to new heights. A semi difficult and ill prepared art project coupled with a late lunch made for a mid morning filled with raised voices, whistles blowing, and constant behaviour reminders. Not to say the counselors are better off at all. I had one ask me yesterday, “What do I do about spilt milk on a bench?” I blinked in disbelief for a moment. Um, clean it up? *shudders* Such has been the training and defines the initiative of the camp counselors as a whole. It’s a scary sight. They are mostly very young, and very inexperienced, and very much needing leadership of a head counselor which simply doesn’t exist this year. I think they eliminated the position for budgetary reasons. As it is one day is ridiculously different from the next. There is little consistency among counselors and the rules, and I am not looking forward to the rest of this summer. Definitely not with the Second and Third graders. My only hope is that the head honcho sees the light and places me with the older age groups. I am just not suited to the little ones.  Nonetheless there were still high points.   At one point this week I was attacked by a group of campers determined to brush the cat fur off of my shirt - I assured them that it was a useless task and the fur/lint roller had not been able to fully clean the shirt in three rounds that morning. Nevertheless, they were very persistant and quite pleased with their five inch square area free of fur on my shirt.  At lunch yesterday we were indoors due to rain and the girls were separated from the boys and started telling scary stories. It was fun to watch them interact and listen to each other...and struggle sometimes to get/keep everyone's attention. I told an old OU ghost story and they really liked it...they begged for another but I will save my arsenal for later.   Thursday I gave the kids a bit of a talk on RESPECT Aretha Franklin style...only to see my lesson duplicated and reinforced on Friday by another counselor in another group in morning circle time.  Friday the CITs (Counselors in training - youth going into 9th grade and up) moved in to join the various age groups as helpers. Both CIT's "reported" to me and asked me what they should be doing and made sure I knew where they were...This was odd since I am not in a position of authority. I let them know that, as I felt it was the right thing to do...that I appreciated them checking in but that there was no requirement to do so with me in particular. They told me that their advisor had told them that in each age group they should stick close to and follow the example of their opinion of the best counselor there...and that they thought that I was the best example in the whole camp so they volunteered for the hoodlum group of Second and Third graders.  Ah, and lastly I still have my knack and ability to get kids to trust me and evoke honesty and resolve disputes. That is good to know. I ask kids questions like, "You know it is against the rules and disrespectful to push another camper, right?" The child answers, "But I didn't do anything." I reply, "Thats not what I asked you. I am not acusing you of anything. I am just checking in with you that you are aware of the rules, and aware of your actions." I repeat the first question again, and they answer "yes." I now say "Good, that means we shouldnt have any problems with this issue in the future." Inevitably they reintone that they didnt do "it." I let them know that (and this is in a case where no one is injured and most likely both parties are semi at fault...which is the majority of the time) what happened or didnt happen is in the past at this point and that I am trying to make sure that they dont have this trouble again in the future. It is crazy surprising how well this methodology works. I always talk to both kids involved in a given dispute...and any witnesses. Rarely are physical acts unprovoked ... and the "victim" has to also be schooled in altering their behaviour to not provoke others. Whenever I talk to a kid one on one (and I do so sometimes when I just see trouble coming versus after it has happened) I let them know that they arent in trouble and that I just want to figure out what is going on with them so that they can avoid being in trouble. When I am trying to evoke the truth I give the same assurances. "Did you crowd into line." *the child shakes his head* (I know well that the truth is otherwise...and the others in line try to tell me so...I silence them and indicate that I am speaking to the one child...) "I want the truth *insert name here*. You arent in trouble, I just want the truth so that I can help everyone in the best possible way." A look of consideration crosses the child's face. "Did you crowd into line?" The child nods. Now, knowing the rest of the story was key. The boy stepped out of line, and then crowded back into his spot. Obviously his mates didnt think much of this for the most part, and I explain to all that if you step out of line you lose your spot, but that it doesnt really matter where you are standing in line. In the case of this child, I innaugurated to start the situation from scratch and told him if he left again he would have to go to the end of the line. I also thanked the kids for getting my attention to help them rather than fighting it out themselves. The "victims" felt that their fellow camper got "a talking to" of some kind from a counselor - which is often enough of a reprimand in their eyes....and the child that crowded felt that justice had been served and yet the future of similar actions was also now accounted for firmly. I think sometimes that when it comes to disolving kid conflicts that I must almost have some kind of instinct with how to deal with them and what to do and what to say. I can hardly take credit as I dont know how I do it...but the kids really value my fairness and justice. I do know that.Maintaining this knack has been key to my success as a child care worker. I was glad to see that this week it was still in place.  Rented Love Actually. A British ensemble piece that takes place at Christmastime. Starring just about all of the main Brit A-Listers, and a couple Harry Potter cast members to boot.  This movie was brilliant. Not too sappy, not too over the top, very well acted, edited and well thought out. Almost every angle or take/voice about Christmas (by those who recognize it as a holiday celebrated) was seen or heard.   The Good: The acting, the writing, the directing, the editing. The multi story line concept fused seamlessly. Stand out performances to: Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, and Hugh Grant. A great American President portrayal by Billy Bob Thorton. The young actor who played Liam Neeson’s son was also fun to watch as well as the woman who played Hugh Grant’s love interest. I loved Hugh Grant’s portrayal of Prime Minister – even his bit of dancing was hilarious evoking a british version of Tom Cruise. Perhaps Kiera Knightly learned a bit about acting from her fellow actors in this flick…but then again I doubt they were ever all together on the set for too long. My husband liked the airport wrap-around and I think he favored the stories of the step-father/son relationship blooming and the writer and Portuguese maid story.  The Bad: Ack I wanted more of a wrap up. It left me sooooooo hanging. I realize that this may have been the point but STILL. The American Milwaukee girls sequence with the character named Colin. A little too much to believe. Besides at the end when the girls come to the UK I have the distinct feeling that being British will no longer be a unique characteristic that is attractive and that our boy needs to develop a personality and but quick. The husband wife pair of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman was not to my satisfaction resolved either. I realize too that the message intended may be something like: “This sort of marital issue cannot be resolved in the last 5 minutes of a movie…” but I wanted a hint of what direction their future was going. Just a hint. Oh, and the cover of Love is All Around that is featured as a plot element in the movie is really terrible….but its meant to be. Other than these nit picky ending dissatisfactions the movie was outstanding and really nearly perfect.  The Ugly: Some of our aging rock star’s wardrobe pieces, and the scary seafood nativity scene (though my hubby found this concept quite entertaining and I am not denying its humour – rather also intoning the scary/ugly factor.) Really, that’s all.  Overall: More thumbs than a Monkey’s Uncle up! Rent this…rent it for Christmas in July…rent it when you are feeling bitter at Christmas (note that I don’t say if you are feeling bitter at Christmas.) Rent it and watch it a couple of times!  Subject Change: my cat is being so darn cute right now. I wish I could take a picture of him…but everytime I get the camera out he just knows its out and that its pointing at him so he ceases doing whatever cuteness he was engaged in and also pretty much refuses to yawn while the camera is pointed at him. Smartass cat. Look , I typed the word camera and he moved into a more average cute position, rather than the all curled around on his back with his paws over his eyes in the air position. *sigh*  Right then. Today is Saturday and I have homework I should be doing right now. Ick. I am luxuriating in my day off work…and wondering what I have done in setting up an appointment with the new executive director of the YMCA. I cant really handle more hours of work too easily, and I doubt they will take me off my childcare duties. My original intent was to get reinstated to my graphics duties but now I am just not so sure. I tossed and turned last night worrying over it.  Also we have rented more movies and borrowed some from the library as well. I will likely try to review them each – unless my limited audience is finding my movie reviewing to be a drone…Which I would appreciate any commentary on.  Life at the in laws goes on. We had limited discussion of Ronald Reagan…my mother in law intoned that the media will stop deifying him once he is underground and cant hear them anymore. My father in law insisted that Reagan toppled communists and I reiterated again and again that it was the people of the USSR and Germany who did the toppling and they deserve the credit for overcoming the regimes that weren’t meeting their needs.   Read a blip today about Senator McCain (R, Arizona) denying that he has been asked to be – nor that he would accept- a vice presidential nomination/candidacy from John Kerry. This would be a very unique combination, and one I think I would still vote for. I think a bi-partisan ticket would be an interesting experiment in the US government. For a few years now I have said that the presidential losing candidate should get the VP office anyways…It would be a perilous walk to walk at some points I am sure but I think the end result would be better leadership. A Dem and Rep combo? We couldn’t get any worse that what we have now so why the hell not.   Tonight is dinner with my step dad for a fathers day get together a bit early as he will be out of town next weekend. Tomorrow I go to my moms for dinner with the distant relatives (distant physically - coming from Las Vegas and Newfoundland) of my mom’s hubby….this will be the third time I have met them I think. So no peace for the weary this weekend.   Supposedly Terminal came out this weekend, but it is not playing here. Stepford Wives, and The Notebook are however and we may try to see one of those this weekend. On the other hand we may hold off and rent them…money is a bit tightish.  As the Beatles intoned…Oh Blah Di Oh Blah Dah life goes on, Bra! La La how the life goes on.  All the news in fits of print— Mack
