NO IT'S NOT INCEST, HE'S MY SIXTH COUSIN!!!!! and tomorrow i'm going to the beach! yay!!! with my cousin, family and heather!! i do not want to go to sudbury, but my mom won't drive to brooklyn. stupid, crazy, retardo mother. shout out to ERIC stuck with the hot hillbilly stupid girls and the smoking fags. good luck in summer school!!!!!! anyways, grandparents are here and lemonades done. later alligator! love, ~bekah~
