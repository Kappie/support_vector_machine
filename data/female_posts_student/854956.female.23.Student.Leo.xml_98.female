This coming week is the last week of the first summer session.  :-)  I'm ready to be done with this class, but at the same time I'm going to miss it.  We honestly had a lot of fun in there.  Lots of group activities, and projects.  Oh well, a lot of the people in my class are taking the Children's Lit class with me next session.  :-D  So, that's the reason I haven't posted in a long time.  I've been very busy.  Typing out papers, creating projects, studying for tests.  I should make an A in the class unless I totally flub any of my other observation papers.  Let's see... not much else is going on.  I'm going to Austin tonight to Mr. Sinus with peoples.  It's the last night for Terminator... :-)  Oh, the ex is being incredibly annoying lately.  He keeps IMing me and calling me... I think he's trying to annoy me to the point that I just date him again to get him off my back.  It won't happen.  I don't have any feelings for him anymore.  I'm totally apathetic when it comes to him.  I don't have feelings of like or dislike... just feelings of annoyance.  ;)  Anyhow... OH!  I'm officially a Music Minor at UTSA now.  :-D  I get to start taking all my music theory classes next semester.  And band.  ICK.  But the upside is that I may not have to audition, depending on how many people they have that are going to play clarinet.  I need to call Dr. Williams on Monday or Tuesday and find out.  Actually, I could email him.  I think that Dr. Davis said that'd probably be a better idea, especially if he doesn't plan on being in his office much until later in the summer.  Okay... well, I must go now.  I need to take a shower, and then go over to H Music in the Forum shopping center.  I have to check about a clarinet.  I found a really good LeBlanc Clarinet that's overstocked right now.  They're selling them at 59% off!  So instead of paying near to $4,000... I'd only have to pay $1500.  But I'm checking with H to see if they'd cut me a better deal than that.  If they don't, then I'll get the other one.  :-)  Okay... now I go... I'll try and post again soon.
