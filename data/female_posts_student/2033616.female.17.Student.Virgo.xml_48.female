BLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAHH grrr  I have been in a really bad mood today.. i think it's the lack of sleep coupled with why i didn't get sleep and the stupid person that caused it... gggrrrrrr.  Such a bad mood in fact, that i attacked Brett Peterson in AP History today, which was actually really funny.. i also made fun of Kyle the whole period.  It just dawned on me that Brett Peterson reminds me of Homestar.  Anyway, i have lots of homework to be keeping me busy right now, so i must hop to it.  So long.
