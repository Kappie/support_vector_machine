Others say that you can be in love with someone, but it's a different kind of love: Teenage Love.   I don't know whether it exists or not, but I've been in a relationship for 6 months (today!!) and I know you can have some pretty strong feelings about one person. I think it's wrong for one person to say, 'Oh, you can't be in love. You're too young' or whatever. No-one really knows what love is, except that it's a feeling, and no living person could possibly determine exactly what another is feeling, however hard they might guess.   Different people in different relationships may have different views of love. Some may feel that they love someone even if they do not particularly like them, but others might think the really like someone, but could never love them.   I just don't see how "teenage love" would be any different to any other kind of love... it's a feeling and feelings can't be divided up into sections according to how old you are! A baby could be just a happy as an old person. A child can hate something as much as their parent can.    It's up to the one in question to decide whether they're in love. They might not realise that they love someone. Their love might grow rather than be "love at first sight". However they love someone, their age cannot determine their feelings!   That's all a bit confusing and contradictory, but what the hell      Peace,
