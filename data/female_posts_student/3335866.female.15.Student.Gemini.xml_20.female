There was the 'You Are Signed In To MSN' window, the folder with my 200 MP3s, the Windows Media Player window, two windows with  urlLink  Gilmore Girls  episode transcripts , the window with  urlLink  Amazing Race  recaps ,  urlLink Uncle Bob ,  urlLink The Vine , and urlLink pamie 's archives. And then of course I had to open another window (this one) just to torture myself with tons and tons of HTML. Iwanted to brag about the tons of websites I was looking at. Ha ha, jackass, I can look at more websites than you. So there.   I can get really anal-retentive about this. (Well, not just this...) Every single little thing that I want to look at must have its own personal window so I don't forget about it. We wouldn't a website to feel unloved, now would we? And with some websites one reading isn't enough. It's like books. I don't read them once. If they're good, I read them over and over and over and over... Saying I've read a book 16 times isn't an exaggeration. When you apply this to websites, you find that I could read every advice column over 4 years on  urlLink Tomato Nation  and still not be satisfied. In fact, you might say that I want to do nothing but read websites for the rest of my life!   Hmmm...   Do you think PMS has anything to do with this?
