Some of anger, some of betrayal, some of hurt, some of sorrow, some of uncertainty. After a deep meditation my mind cleared to help me see my true feelings and the ripples on the water that I face. So many times I turn a blind eye to what I don't want to see. Strengthening the walls around my heart is the common goal. Since my expansion of mind and self I have decided that it is more beneficial to my heart if I go ahead and proceed with the risk that may cause my heart pain or grief. Key word "may". Some of this, I do control. For not all things should I be sorrowful about when my heart is full of compassion, not connection.  My ripple is my female instructor of the department. I may have to say something to her if she crosses me once more. I see clearly what I've so long ignored. I don't know exactly why she transgresses against me. When we had Anatomy Lab together she was so supportive and hooked on my journal like it was her daily fix. Even still, almost every time we meet she says how she wished she could still have my journal. I'm at a point now where I don't want to honor those wishes. I feel she is not trustworthy and her reason for wanting my journal is to be inside my world so she can be in constant awareness of my activities, not of bonding. The intent I feel resonating from her heart is not love or caring as it used to be, it is a great jealousy and aloofness that I feel her projecting toward me. Everything changed between us as soon as I left my husband. I spend time talking to everyone I pass, female students and male. However, when a conversation begins with a male of the group she seems to makes every effort to step in and end it prematurely...like she's running me off from what is hers. Territorial? Queen Bee syndrome? Maybe. Never-the-less, her intentions are not pure. I know I am a sexual person and often come across bolder than I choose with males that I am comfortable expressing around, but when you are simply asking, "how are you, what has gone on in your life lately?", things of that nature, I feel no sexual innuendo, yet I feel she thinks that much of me.  Some examples are, when the other male in my deep tissue class and I are having a basic conversation in the waiting area before class, seconds after it begins (even though she is supposed to be teaching class, she'll come out and make a distraction). She always pulls him away, whether it be to take him outside to talk or to do massage on her, even after class I see in her eyes the wanting that she wants me to leave, she'll stand right by him, closed, until I do.  Even still, the one time I get to catch up on "music man's" life she comes right out and tells me to walk her to the other building in a tone like she had something to discuss with me...right in the middle of our conversation! I should have told her no, but was quite interested in what she wanted to discuss as she has been so uplifting to me in the past. Petty, that's all it was. Petty questions, prys and negativity about the custody decision that was mine to make. "You're going to regret sharing custody"...I'm very sorry she's having difficulties, I wish I could make it go away for her; that has no bearing on whether it will be a regret of mine. My decision was made with an open heart and willfull trust in myself. I do not, nor will I ever regret my decision. On the other hand, her interruptions in my conversations must stop. I would never think for one fraction of a second about having a sexual moment with any male student in the entire campus. None of them could handle me or keep my attention from what I search for.  She insulted me outright last week. Our little red headed gypsy student stood up for me before I could defend myself. The female instructor and her friend that has experienced great loss in her life were talking about the one who's had great loss's, black scrubs. The instructor states, "I used to wear red and black all the time, but I would NEVER wear that now! I am soooo passed that stage in my life", then raises up to look at me. I was wearing a beautiful red summer sweater with very elegant black dress pants! It felt so good to have on. Sweet little gypsy girl pipes up before I could tell the instructor why I chose red. She says, 'but doesn't red mean your passionate or powerful or something?" I let her know the importance of red and what it means in terms of the Chakras like she was questioning.  Last night was beyond my toleration level. She was so fake last night. I did not know who was in her body, but it certainly was not her. She never acts that way unless she's around our director, like she's hiding her faults from him. Whatever is going on between those two is none of my business, but once again she tries to outwit me, another personal attack. I do not choose to play games. I already know, so why should you try to wear your mask in front of the person who feels your heart before your eyes? She consumes herself with the man in our deep tissue class and our instructor when the director is not present. Yet, he steps in and now she dare not misbehave? I know her mischievous ways as she knows mine. She gives me a stern look when I make an appt. last evening with the male in our deep tissue class. I wouldn't dare make it with anyone else in that class. I'm also hurting, I did not get worked on last night, I want to help him get his hours as I want others to help me get mine, I am touch deprived, the touch I have received in class has been very unsatisfying and nonproductive, I know he can be deep like I need, I know my special one is in pain and wouldn't dare ask for him to give to me in his time of trial, I want to be worked on so I can be in better shape the next time my special one and I have time together, you see? And yet, she does not. She walks out the door making sure I know she is to leave, I stay in conversation with the man of the deep tissue class hoping my special one will soon retire for the evening so that I may simply say goodnight. I turn around and she's snuck back in there...just as before. Like afore mentioned, it's none of my concern on their behavior behind closed doors, but tolerate her deception, I will no more. I love her deeply, that's why my spirit is angered so.  If the jealousy in her heart is for me and other male students then she will drown in her negativity for naught, for my concern and heartfelt salutations are for all, female and male. If the jealousy she holds is for the time I share with my special one then she will have her island and make her own there to suffer needlessly. I know what I have to offer him and am thankful for a moment shared with him, even if it ever may be our last. His life belongs to another and I wouldn't dare impose upon that way. I simply enjoy my time with him and grant him peace. Why posses? Why pursue to own another human soul? Are we not keepers of our own way? Can I make you go left? Can I make you go right? Not if you desire your destiny. I can only walk beside you as long as our paths run together.  Be brave my heart for it leads you to uncharted territory. Find your resting place and build your dreams.  Always With love,  BLG
