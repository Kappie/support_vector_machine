Stay still, If just for a moment. Don't shake, Don't move, Let me hold on to you.  Stay here, If just for a moment. Don't run, Don't hide, Let me confide what I have inside.  Don't breathe, just listen, Let me state my position; I love you now, always have, always will.  And that's the way the I feel.     Just for a moment!
