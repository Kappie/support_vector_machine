I should be getting a call with details in the next 3 days from the HR Director, Catherine. I am very excited. I have waited for an opportunity like this most of my life and to have it be sitting right in front of me now if mind boggling.  I will be leaving friends, family and business relationships to meet all new friends, family  business relationships.  I am excited about the culture I will gain and the world knowledge of an experienced traveler. I guess snow I wait again. I remember my first phone interview for this job almost one month ago.  Never did I expect to actually be leaving on a cruisehip shortly thereafter. I have so much to do and so much to plan for - packing up my apartment, putting things in storage, subletting my apartment, turning in my two weeks at ECI, telling sugarback, planning a going away party - getting my passport, taking a physical - 3 weeks just doesn't seem long enough. But maybe it is - if it was any longer I may change my mind. Right now there is just a lot of excitement around the whole job.  I am sure when I get there I will miss everyone greatly - especially Jennifer. I think we have both tried desperately to forget about the cruisejob and really just think about the time we currently have but now that there is a deadline approaching that shifts the focus incredibly. I am anxious to hear back from everyone. I wonder what clothes I will bring, what food I will eat and what interesting coworkers I will have. Wow, now I can daydream for another 3 weeks. (Not like I haven't already been doing that since October 1st).   Oh but wait, reality is still here. I have to go to the doctor today to hopefully get my staples out of my head and then I will head to Tammy's to drop off her vehicle and go to my regular boring day job at ECI. Meeting tonight to talk about SLT Productions which I guess I will not be here to see the result of all of our hardwork and planning.  Oh well, there will be plenty of opportunities for me to do the same in the future.  I am soooo excited!!!
