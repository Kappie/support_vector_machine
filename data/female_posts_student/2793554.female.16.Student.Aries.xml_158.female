Wanting to become something new. i dont. but i am. i realize things about my life that have changed me or helped me. kaley and simone are 2 examples. i called them today, just to talk. its wierd. just talking. connecting with old friends and first loves really makes you think.   aw fuck, i have to go to work. i might rant some more later.  ~abby
