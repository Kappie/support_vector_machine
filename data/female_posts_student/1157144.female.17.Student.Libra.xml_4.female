It starts at 6, will be over by 8, so we can still do something afterwards.  AND...if you win, you get this themed gift basket thingy, every class made one.  Last year my mom's class made an ice cream one with gift certificates to baskin robbins.  THis year my little sister's class made a exotic food one (like she put in one of thoes bamboo shusi roller things).  FINALLY...its for a good cause!! How about it amigos?  I think its an excelent idea.  And FUCK THE PO-LICE!! billy - i knew that, just wanted to make fun of you jason - what's the thing about "i'm still really wet from the park"?  I didn't know you had  that  much fun! CARLIE ~ DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE A GANGSTA (damn song is stuck in my head now, thanks Beth)
