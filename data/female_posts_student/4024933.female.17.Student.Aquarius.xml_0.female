I wanna do that one day, and i even finished a book i was reading, . That's what i love about books, it puts you in a fantasy world and watch other ppl deal with there problems. I was reading a book by Eric Jerome Dickey..Titled Naughty or Nice. But yea ima make it...i even re-evaluated a friendship of 5 years :sniffle:...awww man i bet not start the tears again...i come back later on....still dealin with the stuff with Brice...its coo...it was...it was for the better i guess...
