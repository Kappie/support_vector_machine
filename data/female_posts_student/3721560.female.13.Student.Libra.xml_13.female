I gust heard from Virgina that my friend kyle, and his family were in a car accident, which is pretty awful. luckly No one was hurt.  feel really bad for them, though. I've been feeling really weird lately. Like, no emotion. like I'm usually hyper and talkitive, but I've been quiet and to myslef, I'm not depressed or anything. I gust feel real sdiffrent. I hope I get over it soon. I hate it. well later.
