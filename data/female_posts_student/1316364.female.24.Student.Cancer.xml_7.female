I wish it would rain here. All it has been is overcast. I told Jesse a few days back that the sun when away when he left and I haven't seen it since. I told he he had to come home so the sun would shine again. He had said, he wished he could. I miss him so much.   Today I was checking out other people blogs and came across one for a guy named  urlLink Jeremy Blotter . He is currently overseas stationed in the "Sand Box" as they like to call it. I emailed him and thanked him for writing his blog. I told him that It was so nice to see a person's view of what was going on from someone who was actually over there living it. I hope he emails me back.  In other news, my visit with my landlord went good. I let my mom do all of the talking, I found out after we were on the way back to the house, that they were thinking of raising the rent in the building. I hope that if they do they will deside to take better care of the place... at lease with the cheap rent they were able to avoid it, if the rent is raised then the tenant will expect the landlord to tend to repairs and such in a timly manner, not like they did before. I am sure whatever the rent goes up to though, they will find someone to rent it no problem.  oh well, that $400.00 I get to save a month now! TTYL
