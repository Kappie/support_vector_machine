And tonight we have the Relay For Life walk for the American Cancer Society. I think it will be fun but, it's another night of sleep I wont get. tomorrow I want to go to the mall too after the trumpet sectional to get these shoes I saw in a magazine that I absolutely LOVED! I'm excited about them. Haha.   Anyway, I guess I should get going. Things to do, things to do.
