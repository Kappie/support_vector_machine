Grand opening of Market Mall tomorrow.. lets all jump for joy! Haha, now there's going to be two parts to Market Mall.. the ghetto part, and the rich part... i swear... the new part puts the old part to shame... its so nice..  So another good movie to see is the Manchurian Candidate. awesome.. i love Denzel Washington.. awesome actor. It has a really good plot, some parts made me squeamish.. but oh well. It was good non the less.  Hmmm i think im going to go make some 'roni. haha, its almost 12 and i want supper... little late for that.. oh well.  Wow, i have nothing to say, unless i start rambling. but i won't. hmmm .. go here.  urlLink www.illwillpress.com  or better yet.  urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/signs.html  your soul will enjoy it.  good night --Chellbee         *-* piece by piece, and bit by bit i'll break this down for you, real slow but i can't whisper all of this and i can't seem to let this go *-*
