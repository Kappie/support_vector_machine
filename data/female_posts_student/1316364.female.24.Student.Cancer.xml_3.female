Danielle Barber, the wife of a soldier station with Jesse, informed me that her husband was told that he, and a few other soldiers, were possibly going to be deployed earlier than the rest of the pack. When I told Jesse about this he said he hadn't heard anything about this but that there were tons of rumors going around right now. This could be good news if they get to come home 3 weeks earlier then the rest, however it could also be bad news as well. Danielle and I were planning to fly to Texas in March to spend a few days with our husbands and in fact I had even spend the day with her on Sunday, buying a few new clothes to wear for our trip, and a few lacey items as well. I know I shouldn't get my hopes up for anything involving this whole ordeal but the fact of the matter is that hope is all I really have. I hope that David (Danielle's husband), Jesse and the rest of those who might have to go early, don't have to leave without the rest of the unit, and that they all leave at the same time. I want to fly to Texas to see Jesse, I feel like it is something I need to do.   I feel like the ARMY is taking more then they give.
