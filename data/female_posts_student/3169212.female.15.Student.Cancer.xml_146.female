Inventers of mayonaise who are also wonderfull singers and are obssessed about raisins.  Eunichs to.  As to you, Sarah, I was just stating the obvious and though it may be a bad habit i am hooked.  Being a pirate is almost as bad as execively drinking, yet, that is the way God inteded for me to live as a pirate.  So though i know the entire "your body is a temple", love, i am not ready to give up rum that easy.  And thank you Kuronue for agreeing with me.  Ah, Inuyasha... dont go there, mate! Not that i didnt like the guy, in fact you could say tha we are "friends" but you need to be away from him for a while, a long while.
