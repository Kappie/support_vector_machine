She was all mad because she thought I was going out with Lindsey, and I guess she thought we were ok, or something...  As the last part of the history said on my woebegone Tin Haven, "the present has a lot of potential", and it does...it's really weird.   I'm not saying it's all better. I'm just saying it's not worse.  This settles a lot of things with me, faith mostly, I've prayed a long time for something to turn out right, and perhaps I'm getting a second chance.  Maybe I'm luckier than I thought.
