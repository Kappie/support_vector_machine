(teenagers suck too, by the way.)  just today i had some fat, middle-aged man with thinning red hair and child molester glasses (like those coke bottle ones from  i know my first name is steven , the greatest four hour lifetime movie of all time) buy a giant box of condoms and a bottle of lube.  supressing my shudder was almost as hard as trying not to gasp when that fingerless old man waves to me.  the only interesting people i've met so far are these british triplets that always come in and make penis jokes to each other that are only half-intelligble to me because i'm an accent-ignorant american teenager.  they're always really gross looking, and collectively smell like a melting driveway.  but they call me  "love", so that's fun.  there is, however, one gift working at the drug store with a bunch of middle aged ladies and a college drop-out has bestowed upon me.  and that is the burning desire to go to college and never spending any more time than i have to working retail with a bunch of losers.  get out while you still have time.  good night, loves.  tomorrow is mother's birthday, and i should get up early and make her food or something because  she's depressed; either about turning forty-three or not being able to pay her car insurance or both.
