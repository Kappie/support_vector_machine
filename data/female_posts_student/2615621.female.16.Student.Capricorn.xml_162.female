But he gave me the line "u can rest here just as easily as u can rest back in NC" yeah i know..but its not the same. i gotta stand my ground on this one, even if Everclear would be kickass to see in concert and have pics of..but it doesnt matter..graham colton is just a state away.   -til next time  *much love and chuck taylors*  oh p.s: i added dannys cousin to my messanger list, but im not going to mention danny i dont think. well..i havent decided..she knows bay talks to me about danny but doesnt know why. i might just laugh and say "yeah well i was tellin her my list for the perfect bf one time and i gave him a car and a name and everything and it was basically danny." hahaha giggle giggle act all sweet towards his cousin. Dude i gotta be nice to this chick and make her like me...lol am i a hard person to like? yeah..she'd go back and tell danny either "yea man shes cool as fuck" or "fuck that crazy ass bitch" and i dont wanna come off as though im just talking to her to get to danny u know..so thats why i dont know if i wanna talk about danny right away. Turn into her best friend, then move in on her cousin...sounds like a plan. muhaha
