Work was a nightmare.  It was Traveling Tuesday, so the theme today was Mexico.  Sue set us teenage councelers to play this game with rotating groups of kids.  It was a little like Scatorgories - or however you spell that.  The problem was, the kids were like 5-6 years too young for the game.  Most of them can't hardly write their name.  So it was extreemly painful - even when we changed the game from writing to verbal.  Something like slowly having your eyelashes pulled out one by one.  The guachimoli (how in the world DO you spell that?) was good though.  Yummy stuff.  I ate like a gallon of the stuff.  So... Yeah...    I wrote a song today.  Someday I'll add music, 'cause I like the words.  I know you are all gonna ask who it's about, so I'll answer here:  It's about no one in particular.  haha.  I might still add more to it... Maybe...  But anyway... Here it is:  Where are you tonight Do you sit and think of me As you turn off the light Who do you see Inside your mind Flitting across your memory Am I all but left behind Will you remember me Do you wish that I stood near Do you remember when...  Chorus: Do you remember when we walked together Along the road and laughed together When we lay on the grass side by side Looked up at they sky together Watched the clouds go by  together Slip across the wide blue sky And we were together  Would you care if you knew How much I wonder And think of you 'Cause I remember the way you'd smile You made me laugh The world would light up for a while Do you still know who I am Do you remember when....  Chorus  Signing off - Jack the really bored songwriter
