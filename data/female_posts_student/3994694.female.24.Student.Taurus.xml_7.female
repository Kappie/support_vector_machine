One of the reasons I haven't contacted many old friends is that I don't want to have to be the person they think I am, to live in the box I made for myself long ago. I have broken that mold, am a new person and so on, yet I feel pressure to be that person of old. I don't know whether I should have contacted my friend or not. I know I am not the person he thinks I am, and I want to prove otherwise -- but why does it matter? Why do I care? What are my motives anyway, besides curiosity?   I have a desire to be the changing force in people's lives, to lift them out of despair and monotony, but I myself am often despairing and my life is sometimes monotonous. Who am I to play the compassionate saviour with them?   I do care though, even though I haven't seen them for years, they have been in my thoughts and my heart. Sometimes I think I try to shut myself down and be totally unemotional with my 'old person' friends, I think I am different and somehow isolated from them. But we grew up together, and even though we have gone different ways, we still understand some fundamental things about each other. Why do some people stay in your heart for so long? Why can you forget some people with no regret, but not others?  Let's just hope I can be honest and true in this renewed friendship. That God will show meHis purpose here,rather than me dictating mine. That I can accept changes in my friend. That I can communicate changes to him. I am no longer 17 and swayed by every wind. But neither amI ashamed of who I am and who I was, orof who I nowfollow.
