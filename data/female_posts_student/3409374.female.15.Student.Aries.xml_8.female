Ahh...now i feel more relaxed liao. LoL Aiyar...he kept asking me to tell...but i still can't leh. I dun haf courage. Hum ji. Haha. Anyway, after listening to each other, we were wondering y on earth did we tell each other in the first place. So i guess he has become my confidante and i have become his. It's good to haf a listening ear sometimes :) Guess wat...i admitted i had an infactuation on him for a while...and u know wat he said? He said he felt it too!!!!! I was like...[jaw drops] Haha...sadly, it was only an infactuation...haha...he called me unfaithful [jokingly] but then later he said "i'm not like u...i'm loyal". Now i'm confused...was tt supposed to be a hint or something?  Sigh...i'm useless at spotting this kinda hints. And it hurts sometimes if u do it wrongly.
