She left three notes in the house to remind me i was like CHRIST MOTHER, ONE WOULD SUFFICE! Yeah there was one on the back door where i come in from the bus stop, one on the fridge, two feet away from the back door, and one on the comp. Omg i am not THAT much of a ditz. Hmm anywho. So i got my composition back from la today. It was about my insane italian relatives. She writes at the bottom "this is an excellent oppurtunity to learn italian, it wouldn't hurt you to learn a few phrases. I was like ew, who died and made you queen of the bitches. Besides I'd like to see her learn italian from Uncle John talking to her, ha fat chance. OMG AIM IS REALLY SCREWED UP!!! the comp goes to the aim window automatically. Whenever I click on Internet Exploror it just goes to AIM. And when I quit out it just signs itself back on automatically. It's really scary. Gata go restart. Be back later, maybe, to finish typing about my day (s). byeee, wish me luck.
