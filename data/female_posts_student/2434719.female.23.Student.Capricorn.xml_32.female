I WILL NOT DO LAUNDRY UNTIL I GO HOME.  if you don't know already, i have not done laundry since spring break (around the 15th of march). oh yeah. that's right. it's been over a month. yet i still have clean clothes! i have a bunch of skirts and a pair or two of pants, and of course shorts. this is great.... i don't know how i'm going to work this out.  newman says that when i'm left with formal dresses to wear to my finals, i should pose with my professors and take pictures.  "when you feel pretty, you think pretty."   one problem that has come up, is i can not fit any more laundry into the cabinet/laundry basket area. the clothes have formed a solid rectangle, filled to capacity. i have had to begin another pile, on my floor.   nice.  wait. i only have about 3 more days worth of underwear (yes, yes i had that much to begin with). I had bought more socks already, and finished those!   this may cost me more than a trip to the laundromat :).
