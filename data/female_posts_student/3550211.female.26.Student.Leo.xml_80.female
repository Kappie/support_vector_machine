Levy poses a very thought provoking question:  Has there ever, in the four months since it broke, been a refutation of, an official response to, or even a developed conservative talking point on the story that Pentagon plans to take out Zarqawi before the Iraq war were vetoed by the White House, because Zarqawi was more convenient as a living terrorist in Iraq who could help justify the war?   I wouldn't doubt that this is probably true. And that is some scary shit. Of course, before I answer this question, I will have to educate myself on this subject.
