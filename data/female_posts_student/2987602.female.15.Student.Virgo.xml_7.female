Well today i went to the mall w/ Dani and i got my dad his father's day gift and i got x tina her bday gift so im all ready lol. And all ineed now is a bathing suit... but i need it by Thursday so i need 2 go to the mall again soon, maybe i'll like go w/ my mom so i wont have to pay for them lol. I hate this humid weather b/c it's makes my hair all poofy and that really pisses me off b/c its poofy enough w/o the humidity. Im so mad i couldn't go swimming @ Kat's 2day but i couldnt get a ride over and by the time my mom came home it was 2 late 2 go over u know... but i think i'll call her 2morrow and say im sry i couldnt go b/c i told her i'd call her 2day but there was no point b/c i couldnt go ne wayz. I solved my music crisis, well i dont think u even know wht my crisis was... ok well ive had a lot of free time on my hans now that schools out so the past couple of days i've been dl music on my dell(my other computer the apple doesnt have ne free music programs) so ne wayz i put all my music on a program b/c it skips when i listen to it on Limewire so then i was looking @ my library on limewire and i guess the music is shared so ppl were hitting my music which is highly illegal and i dont know how to stop it so i figured that i'd just delete it all b/c i had it on another program ne wayz... so i started deleting it and then i got to about the letter N (my music is alpabetized) and i thought i'd check 2 make sure that it didnt effect the program that i kept the music on...well it did the music that i had deleted wouldnt play!!! So i had to re download all the songs i had downloaded which took me like a couple of hrs 2day... not like i had was doin ne thing b/c i was stranded in my house lol... ugh!!! Well at least i learned my lesson lol, so thats basically how i caused and fixed my music crisis... Not that u probably cared lol i bet most ppl didnt even read to here and if u did u must b really bored lol so ne ways Later!!!
