Thanks Mr. Blankensfeld(spelling??)... Driving was okay. Bob made me drive first. I hate driving first. I drove for a what seemed like a half hour, then Sal drove for a while too. I think the other kids name is Luke. He drove for 10 minutes and we realized we have 10 minutes left and one driver left so he told Bob and Bob made Mike(not sure, the name just popped into my head) drive back to school.  The day slowly progressed....  Went to the movies with Eric! I found a ciggy on the floor. Sadly it was a Newport but it doesn't matter, it was good. Cassandra came later on. The Eric from the lunch hacky sack group was there. So was Mike Bianca. We all hacked and i had my ciggy, saw the movie, hacked some more and now im home! Spidey Man 2 was great. Go see it.
