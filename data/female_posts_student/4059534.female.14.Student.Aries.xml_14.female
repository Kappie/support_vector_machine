Luckily Kate is smart and she will think of something.  Today has been o.k. My sister is the BIGGEST pain in the bum, she cries at the smallest thing, "Meggie, you won't give me chips, WAA WAA WAA." Bah, I do not care. I have to do a stupid woodwork assignment to which really sucks. Then my Science game needs finishing, and god knows what else I've probably forgotten half the stuff I'm suppose to do. Ohh S***E Maths...DAMMIT... I better do some work i suppose.... TA TA
