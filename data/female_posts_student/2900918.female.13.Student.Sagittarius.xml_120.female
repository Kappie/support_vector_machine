Dont scold me for being lazy, its a rainy day today.. cool day to hang inside and sleep  Snooze: If you don't have NOKIA phones and you're apparently ignorant, "snooze" is a button on the phone [when your alarm rings] to delay the ringing about 10 mins later. Must add that its a good invention for folks like me. He. He.   It's a complete torture to know that you have to wake up [and go to school] during rainy days when your bed is so.... soo.... cosyyyyy.... Many of us should have that experience, and as my mom always say, "Best days to sleep indoors are rainy days."  It's a frickin' fact.  CCH should set a rule that we are allowed to go to school late on rainy days. But with ppl like YUE around, its an impossible target unless you stick another penis into his own. Or maybe two.   I know what you're thinkin': EEEEWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!  I would kill myself if I had to see something like that, be it YUE or not.  God I love rainy days. _____________________________________________________________________  may it rain in your world. ohfreak [dot] blogspot [dot] com
