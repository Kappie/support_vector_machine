Like my hair was a mess and my outfit sucked (not that I'm all apperence shallow, it's just my shirt was too big and my pants were too uncomfortable and too long, bla bla bla) and I got in trouble like 3 times for bull shit reasons. And to top off the suck ass day I forgot about *Simple Plan* being on tv. I was beyond pissed I think I cried for about a 1/2 hour. It sucked but I'm passed it. plus I caught a repeat of the Simple Plan show thingy yesturday. Well how's it going? I got some cash so I'm thinking about what cds to buy..... so far on the mabey list is : BoxCarRace Story of the Year-Page Avenue Taking Back Sunday-Tell All Your Friends One of the Atticus comps A warped Tour Comp mabey Vendetta Red-Between The Never And The Now  A MXPX album New Found Glory Blink 182-Take Off Your Pants and Jacket You get the gist of it...... I'm not sure what I'll pick though. I'm bla today I feel bla. it's wierd. Yeah this retarded kid keeps trying to mess with me online so on the off chance he reads this , Fuck-OFF! bye
