You'll never have me   the way you once did.   I'll stay here alone.   Because I'm not enough.   Not good enough.   Not strong enough.   Not weak enough.   Not childish enough.   Not jaded enough.   Not enough for you.   Keep your fucking roses.   Nail me to a wall.   Pale flesh washed white   from blood loss and tears.   Stupid.   Give your life to me.   Watch me learn to hate you.   As if I didn't enough already.   Despicable, you are.   Weak.   Childish.   Beautifully Jaded.   Bleed.   Kneel.   Beg.   No.   I won't.   I can't.   I shouldn't.   I will.   I always will.   Unhappy for you again.   Here for you so you   can be okay.   You called me your Angel.   Said I was born to fly.   But all you do is tie me down.      ~fin~
