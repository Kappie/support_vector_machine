       
      Just back from my third and final experiment.  The stupid experimenter didn't show!  I waited for 45 minutes in total and extremely pissed off, left and went up to report the incident to the course assistant, who of course, wasn't there yet.  So, I came home, fired off a polite but obviously perturbed email and had to sign up for another experiment - Cognitive again, crap! - on Monday.  The website says: "We consider it a grievous discourtesy to fail to keep an appointment."  SO DO I!  But will I get any credit for it?  Of course not.  I just better as hell not be penalized for it.  Got a nice birthday prezzie book from E.  Thanks E.!  I have a covert lunch meeting with a colleague at 1pm and then it's time to resume studying for my Psych exam on the 28th.  It never ends, I tell you ...  More to come...
