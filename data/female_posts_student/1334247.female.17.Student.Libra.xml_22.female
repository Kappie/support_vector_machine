My wonderful sister, Micki, wants to take me to a HANSON concert in St. Louis at the end of July. However, I think we're going on vacation that week, so I dont know if I'd be able to go. Another grr, argh. I went on the river for the first time this year yesterday. It was Matthew, Dad, Julie and me. It was cold when we went fast, but on the way back from Burlington, we went very slow, and it was so nice.
