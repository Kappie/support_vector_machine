I will begin this entry with our latest correspondence with Michael Menkin, the man who operates the website about alien abductions. if anyone happens to be interested in visiting his sites, here are the links:  urlLink http://www.stopabductions.com      urlLink http://www.aliensandchildren.org     both sites feature illustrations of aliens as well as lists of their capabilities. the former includes a bio on Menkin, which from reading i deduced that Crazy seems to be a dominant trait in the Menkin genepool; while the latter focuses more on...well, aliens and children. EEEEEEEEEE--TEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE PHone HOooooooME.        Jolie writes:    i will certainly go ahead with the thought screen helmet. the only problem is that i'm not sure i'm safe leaving my house without a helmet, and i don't have the materials to make the helmet. i was wondering if some other material would work long enough for me to go out and buy the velostat, such as foil, or a bike helmet? would sunglasses work the way the goggles do?    thank you for all your help!        Menkin responds:    You are not safe in your house. The aliens go through walls to take people, even brick walls.If you aren't being taken in your house, then you aren't being abducted.Read Budd Hopkins Witnessed. The alien's favorite scam is to take people out of their cars by taking them through the windshield, yes, through the windshield.You have to order Velostat, you can't just go to a supplier and buy it, unless you are buying large Velostat bas, but the minimum order for bags is 1,000 and bags cost about $1.40 a piece. That's why I tell people to buy rolls or piece by the yard.    See  urlLink http://www.ufoabduction.com     Michael Menkin
