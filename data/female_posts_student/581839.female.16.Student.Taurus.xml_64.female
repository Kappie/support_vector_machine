You know what? bess says that i should say something about peanut butter and strawberrys so i said it so great. you know, i'm not sure i understand blogs, because i mean, who's reading this? no one! i mean, who cares about my life? thats not the point, the point is that this is a venting system, and its good for me. ink link isn't working so i'll keep on typing until it does. i think that if i don't leave soon i'm gonna miss lunch.. hee hee. i don't have a phone jack in my room, so ummm, i don't know when i'll be able to write again. we're supposed to get DSL soon, and that way, i'll be able to have a wireless connection. pretty cool huh? my family's never had a fast connection before, so this will be great for us. I'm going to miss lunch i know it! no one is listening to me! i don't understand why we have lunch so early in the morning, 11:15! thats just too early! lunch is in the single digit zone. not 11 ish. well, i'd better go.
