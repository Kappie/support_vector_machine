After graduation, she went to nanyang polytechnic. She was slacking and lacking. I pushed her, made her stand, but she slack. She enjoyed life, attentions and activities. I was scared, but I am glad to see her happy. I was scared she might not want me. After polytechnic, she worked. She felt empty, she felt lacking in closeness with her co-workers. I comforted her, encouraged her. Perk her up with motivations. She was later busy with activities with her co-workers. I felt left out, I miss doing stuff with her. I voiced out, but I was mistaken for having no other friends to be with. Still I wanted to be part of her life. I would make effort to invite her out to do stuff that we used to enjoy. At the eleventh hour she would either forgotten about our plans, or she would cancel it to make time for her other friends. I was of course sad and disappointed, I grumbled and complained. But still I miss her. I would share my joy and sadness with her, she used to share with me hers. Slowly as we matured, She drifted away from us. She would gave us the lowest priority, I would always be placed on the waiting list. I cried and was confused, did I do anything wrong? Was I so undesirable as her Friend? But still at my lowest hour, I would go to her  and she would come to me at her lowest point. Things went really bad after she met John........
