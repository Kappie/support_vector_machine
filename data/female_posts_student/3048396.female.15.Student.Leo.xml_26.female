Past two days have been really good and I really don't know why. *shrug* maybe because it hasn't rained and the sun has been out so I guess that could be it. So yeah not alot has happened. We have a new pastor here that might become ours and I know who he is cuz he was in Hubbard when we had the Youth Council meeting there. I found out that he has a son named Jon and Im supposedly gonna try to set him up with Kait. Could be interesting. So yeah. Hopefully the 6th Kait will come here and we will go to Sioux Falls shopping and then she'll stay untill the 11th when we go down to Grinnell. Hopefully that will work out. Cuz yeah I dunno when else she could stay. So yeah. Hmm...Today we had a football cheerleading meeting and Duncan had already picked out the sqaud just cuz there wasnt enough time for tryouts now that school is almost out so ofcourse im not on cuz she picked almost the same people from last year. But im an alternate and I'll still practice but I dunno if we'll have enough for a JV sqaud or not cuz right now its only Jen and I so who knows whats gonna happen next year. *shrug* But we'll still get to help for Homecoming and probably cheer then. So theres still stuff to look forward to. Then I'll defenatly make varsity the next year cuz there wont be very many girls out anymore so yeah. It'll be all good. Yup. Yesterday I got my schedual for next year and Im gonna die 2nd quarter. *sigh* I have Biology, World History and Algebra 2. Might be kinda hard...Probably will be...but I have stuff with friends so Im not gonna go switch it or anything. I'll just live with it next year. So yeah. I really don't know what else to talk about...only 5 and a half more days....I hope they go fast...I wanna be done with school! Eh stupid Memorial Day Parade on Monday...its soo gonna suck. Since my parents hate me they wont let me get out of it...so I'll be the only trombone. Oh joy. Eh maybe I wont play...I mean I shouldnt even have to go....I already added my points up...and put them in...Nobody would know....anyways....I'm gonna go...  -Tara
