The cramps were making their comeback; wanted to write this damn story down, but felt too tired to even think about anything other than the first line.  Plus, the GLORIOUS Spring Mix didn't play well in the player during the outline-typing session.  He was right: it's not something that gets its first listen while working.  So, I planted myself on the couch with the headset, gathering my notebook and the other treats included in today's package near me and started over.  By the fouth song, I was ready to go.  Completley rejuvenated and loving every note.    Now on the 15th song of the 2nd disc and show no signs of stopping before giving it another listen.  In the meantime, here's what came of the 2nd go-round of the 1st disc:    On the corner of Pocatello Creek and Common Sense  	  "Did anyone bring anything?" I asked, crawling out of my red Chevy pickup truck, Ned, taking stock of the area I selected for the camping trip.  It wasn't the first time I'd been there.  Scoped it out on one of my many drives up Scout Mountain.  Ned at 45; Melissa blaring; thinking about being in love and imagining our life together when I blew out of this town and told the parents the truth in another life called college.  Remembering our first experiment with sex in the wilderness made me smile that night and I tried to mask it by making alcohol inquiry.     She's going to die when I tell her about this.     "No," one of my new friends answered.  "Rachel would be uncomfortable ..."  "That's cool.  We're going to have a fuckin' great time anyway."  I had no complaints, really; I was with my new group.  It only took two years of high school to find, slowly approach and fit myself within their circle.  Still felt like a bit of an outsider, or at least a newcomer, as they had all been together since the cradle of junior high.  But I was accepted by the close of junior year and was now one of the gang by the August before our last together.    We constructed a fire pit and dug a pee hole.  Once the sun set, Ned's break lights provided an ample source of fun, especially when we cranked up Private Dancer on repeat.  The pictures didn't actually have the desired red glow, but we wouldn't know that for another few weeks.  We each struck poses in the red light and a few naughty, memorable group shots made their way onto many a roll.  Throughout the activities, my mind was continuously caught between thoughts of the other visit to this place, the other reason hands had been washed in the creek nearby, and the fact that I'd at last found friends I could comfortably be myself with.  They didn't  know , of course, but I wasn't troubled by that just yet.  After the debacle of 9th grade, I spent most of my time in school being the smart-assed teacher's pet in class and the zombie girl in the basement who eventually fell in love with a secret.  Needless to say, it felt incredibly freeing to be able to reach out to a group of gals who reached back.  Gals to be gals with; gals who made me laugh and whom I made laugh back.  Gals to be 17 with.  Eventually, we made our way around the fire where the conversation evolved into alcohol stories.  "I've tried champagne, and MAN ..."  "Whiskey and Squirt got me sooo fucked up this one time ..."  And, as is to be expected with situations such as these: late summer evenings in the depth of youth and impossibility, we quickly set our minds to getting our lips around some contraband.  Parents' stashes, siblings, friends, cousins were all considered and quickly discarded.  We had to keep reminding ourselves of our innocent friend's sensibilities, after all.  "If you guys are going to drink, I'm going to go home."  Somehow, she managed to not make it sound quite as threatening as the words themselves suggest.  Instead, the conservative upbringing's guilt trip kicked in, and the attempt at sympathy had the reverse effect on the three main culprits.  Finally, Katy came up with the plan.  We would take a fifth of Jim Beam from her parent's basement cabinet, mix it with Squirt and "just get buzzed."  We wouldn't get trashed, of course, because Rachel's beliefs still needed to be respected.    Plus, I had a dentist appointment in the morning.  Katy, Natalie and I were ready to leap into action when we were entreated one last time by the diplomats Tricia and Kjersti:  "You guys, Rachel is really upset.  Please don't go ..."  "Fuck that!"  I was on now; this was happening.  "She's already alienating herself!"  "Yeah!" Nat joined in.  "She's already pissed, we may as well drink!"  "I know ... it's just that I don't want this to be ruined for her!"  "Well, then you two talk her into lightening up because we're going."  And so it was.  We climbed into Ned and made our way off the mountain, into town and the unknown, Savage Garden blaring though the speakers.  The co-pilots managed the music, so we got snippets of "To the Moon and Back", then "Your Little Secret" ...  "No!  This isn't it!"  ... to "The Only One" to "If I Only Wanted To" ...  "I  love  this song!  But where's that other Savage Garden song?"  "Yea!  The Chick-a-Cherry-Cola one!"  20 minutes and three scratchy throats later, we turned on to Katy's streets.  We cut the music and headlights several blocks away and parked one block away from her house.  We knew going in we would have to Army-crawl under the trailer in the driveway to access to basement-level patio door.  But faced with the 18 inch space, a part of us hesitated ... but only for a moment.  This would only make the story all the greater.  So we slithered, grunted and laughed hysterically, but quietly enough to convince ourselves we would go undetected.  Once inside, Katy immediately secured the glass monstrosity that was the object of this whole endeavor and Nat bolted for the bathroom.  "Don't flush!!"  Katy hissed in a whispered tone.  And I was left watching the spectacle, already shaking my head at our adventure I didn't want to end.    Several minutes that felt like hours later, Katy and I ushered Nat away from the tiny-so as not to be heard-stream of water coming from the sink in her concentrated effort to wash her hands and we retraced our steps and slides back to Ned, waiting in the wings.  But our adventure was only half over.  We needed mixers now.  And cups.  The closest and only source we considered was the convenience store positioned on the turn-around corner of the police force's nightly cruise route.  It was a low-risk night, being late Thursday night, early Friday morning, but our comfort level was compromised as we parked a few spots away from a cruiser.  "Don't leave me in here with the booze!" Nat wailed as we opened the doors.   "Just don't waive it around and you'll be fine!"  We admonished her.  "Besides, I have to pee!"  While Katy procured the liter bottles of our high quality mixer and red plastic cups, I tried to convince myself it wasn't completely obvious to the clerk what we were doing in Common Cents at 1 in the morning, buying such items.  But he went for it and we were not deterred.    Pulling ever-so-carefully back onto the street that would carry us to the interstate and our night of drunken debauchery, I took stock of the situation:  "Okay!  I don't have any broken head or taillights, my registration is current, we all have our seatbelts on ... right?!  And I'm going 75 all the way out there ..."  "Andrea!  You're going fucking 45!"  Indeed, in a 35 zone, next to the fire department's headquarters.  The rest of the drive back to the mountain found us at the posted speed limit, no more than, and our voices pitched at the highest level.  By the time we returned to the site, the alcohol was completely unnecessary, but any promise to stop at buzzed was left under the trailer.  We drank; we danced around the fire; the diplomats joined in and continued to console Rachel.  We three were left to our own drunken devices, as no one else seemed to want to have anything to do with us, professing our oaths of devotion and sisterhood for all time, endlessly recounting our odyssey and that fucking tiny stream of water!  We were shunned by all but the occasional crossover by Tricia, who answered our every cry of: "TRICIA!  Get over here!  We love you!  You are my best friends EVER!" and corresponding group hug.  Many trips to the pee hole were made, me on Katy's arm for drunk-leading-drunk support.  We all got caught up on Katy's sex life and were immensely relieved to learn she was at last in the habit of having orgasms.  I couldn't help but smile, thinking about how my addition to the conversation would change everything.  Instead, Katy became the self-proclaimed experienced one among the group, with Nat coming in a close second, and I looked over at the spot Ned then occupied, remembering.  We outlasted the rest of the group, finally crawling into Ned's bed, none of us allowed in the tents, as the sky began lightening with the first rays of the day.  At 7, I moved into the cab.  Around 10, as I made my way into the house, hoping the hangover wasn't as obvious as it felt, Mom caught me just as I tried to get downstairs to my bed.    "Have fun?"  She asked.  She knew.  "Oh yea ... definitely."   Don't look at her, avoid opening your mouth too much!   "Have a little to drink?"  "Ummmm..."  "Somebody bring some wine coolers?"  "Uh ... yea.  They hit me a bit harder than I thought they would, though."
