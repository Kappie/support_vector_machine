Yeah, it's just for fun but stupid blogger has been messing up the layout and the order of the posts as well as NOT updating any of the posts properly.  It was only today that they updated my blog and put up a post i wrote a few WEEKS ago.  I'm at my wit's end here.  http://riceballtrio.blogspot.com
