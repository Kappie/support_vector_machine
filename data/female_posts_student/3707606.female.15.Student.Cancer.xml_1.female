Yeahhh then I sat on my computer for like the entire day.   Talked to Aaron and he's like all depressed and shit and it really isn't a good thing. Aww I felt so bad and whatever I said didn't help anything. Then he like cam online at like 2 in the morning his time and was like... "couldnt sleep, im sorry, I didnt been to blow up at you. I love you." aw it was sweet. And yeah that sounds so bad because I have Chad.   Meh... Chad got his frame back so now both his bikes are working which means what little time he had for me before will now be taken up and the chances of me like ever seeing him are so small. Ugh he was being stupid today... when I got the chance to talk to him he like hardly talked at all and shit and right now, as it stands, I'm thinking about breaking up with him and thats bad. I mean I have so much fun and stuff WHEN we get together and shit but he like never even trys to make an effort to call me even when I like call him and shit and then hes just like "oh do you wanna do something and im all like yeah and then hes like oh no wait I cant. and its like WTF if your gonna ask you dont just then go no nvm all the time, just things like that that really piss me off.  I mean maybe it would be best to just break up with him... one less thing for him to think about, not that he seems to think about me anyways, then he could just go biking whenever the fuck he wanted and he wouldnt ever have a girlfriend that he had to see. I donno... I aint gonna do anything yet, wait till I can talk to Melissa. Maybe I'll call her tomorrow or sumtin or maybe today... I donno I need to think about shit first before.
