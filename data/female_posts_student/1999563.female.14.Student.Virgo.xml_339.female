We had our tutor thing at Multnomah (a christian college in Portland)  Everyone there was really nice and I met a professional skateboarder. He was the libraian!!! Hahah. He was SO nice! He is one of the lead guys at the Skate Church.  We had our tutor session  in the cafe and everyone was having these really cool concersaions (I am an eves dropper *wink*)  Like one was about how amazing god was and they were like "A non christian looks at an apple and sees an apple, but a christian sees an apple and sees a beautiful work of art" It made me happy ): I love overhearing conversations. Then another group of people were getting there degree in theory. and they were humming different rythms. :)  Then this morning uh..yeah. today is gonna be BUSY BUSY BUSY!!!
