It's been down for a whole day now, and it's been closed for almost a week. I've been transfered to Hartselle so I can still get in my hours so I can be able to pay my car payment. heh Okie, that was just a little bit of clearing up information so non of you will be confused about why I'm talking about the Hartselle Mcd's instead of the 6th Ave. one. lol   Today's working experience: Being forced to use the d9mn metal ice scoop in drive thru. lol It takes up too much time and wastes so much ice. It takes up too much time because you have to stand right in front of the ice bin, pick the scoop up, scoop up a couple of scoops, put the ice into the cup,then make the drink (and while you're doing all that, you'vegot to take orders).Now,I don't know if you guys think I'm crazy for fussing about having to use thescooper thing, but when youare backed up in drivethru and are pending on several orders....it's nerve blowing. I got in trouble early today because Iwas just scooping with the cup by "Max" (the Hartselle big-wig of mcd's). Hewas like "Stop what your doing,now look at me" I looked at him. "Do you want your paycheck to be a pleasing one?" I shook my headup and down. "Then you better start using that scoop and stop wasting ice" I was like ooooo, ice costs so much....whoop-de-doo....weeven have an ice maker that makes the ice....sohow does my paycheck fit into all this? lol There are some weird people at that Hartselle store. lol Then "Max" got onto me about holding the mic when I was trying to take an order where the other person could hear me. He was like "Don't touch that" I mouthed "sorry" to him. Then he walked away and I rolled my eyes. lol And I thought "David" was bad. (David is the big-wig of the 6th Ave. mcd's) It was truely a hectic day at mcd's today. We stayed fairly busy all day long. I've made two new friends, one of them is a manager, and the other one is a junior from Brewer. She's in the band @ Brrr, and also plays clarinet...so we're pretty much the same. We like the same music and we hang out with the same type of people. I found that really freaky. lol And our personalities are the same. Weird. lol  I was asked to come into work tomorrow from 2PM until 8PM. Jay (the schedule head-honcho) came and asked me if I would come into work tomorrow and I said, "I don't know, what time?" "2 until 8"-Jay "Ok, yeah, sure, why not"-me "Well, that was easier then I thought it would be"-Jay "I usually don't give problems with that kind of stuff"- me "Well, you would have had no choice if you did have a problem"-Jay  -I just turned around and took an order that had been beeping on the headset for a few seconds. I thought in my head "b9st9rd". So, maybe not all of the Hartselle people are as nice as I would like for them to be....but a big majority of them are really nice. haha  My schedule for the week of July 26th-August 1st Monday: 4am-1pm Tuesday: off Wednesday:10am-2pm Thursday:off Friday:off Saturday:6am-2pm Sunday:4am-2pm  -I'm not sure if I posted this one on my other blog or not, and I'm too lazy to go check...lol  Well, until I come back from work tomorrow....buh-byes
