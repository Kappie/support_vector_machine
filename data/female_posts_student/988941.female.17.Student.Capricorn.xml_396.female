I thought the ROll of Thunder question was a bit tricky tho, asking all this nonse about how much has Cassie learnt of the right and wrong wasy to live? Ridiculous. Anyway, I thought it was okay. I never bother to plan cos it just wastes my time, and I never pay any attention to the plans anyway, so from my experience it;s more worthwhile for me just to start writing, and worry about what I do next when I do actually get stuck, which thankfully dind't happen. But I guess everyone is different! I suddenyl think iof random things to write.  So, History revision class tomrrow, I hope you're going Nicki otherwise I'll be lonely! Then a week off- bliss!  CAn't wait, havent' got all tht much planned though because I want to do a lot of revision.
