Today there's a Cup Finals partay at Britt's house and i've decided that i'm going to make a cake for it.  Its going to be a 20 minute brownie cake and its going to be yummy.  I'm going to hunt around for blue icing and write "go lightning!" on it. Go Lightning!!! Win the Cup and save us from Canadian/Iginla-ization!!!!  gosh i miss soooooo many people now that the summer has started....there are some people i don't get to talk to anymore and it makes me sad!!!  alright....stop, its cake making time! (hehe nadia)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
