But now I'm 21, and to be honest I don't think I'll look forward to any more birthdays. This also means that as much as I feel like I'm 16 still...I'm not. Every year that passes I keep getting new responsibilities. Which is not so great, but with those responsibilities comes much more freedom than I've ever had.  On the upside, I can go out to clubs. I can drink or buy drinks anywhere. I can go out with all my 21+ friends. It's actually kind of funny cuz I feel like I'm still 16 yet many of the friends I grew up with...now have children of their own.   January 16th Went to work. Went to eat with my dad, my brother, my sister-in-law, both of my nephews, and my boyfriend. We went to celebrate my dad's birthday which was on the 15th. We ate at an Italian restaurant. The food was verry yummy! This whole month is filled with so many birthdays!   January Birthdays  My big bro - Jan. 3 My boyfriend - Jan. 13 My dad - Jan. 15 Me - Jan. 18 My friend - Jan. 23 My boyfriend's lil' sis - Jan. 25  This is always a fun month for me!   January 17th   My birthday was sooooooooo much fun!!! We went to a restaurant/bar/club in the Universal City Walk called Cafe Tu Tu Tango. We had some appetizers and I bought my first drink. It was called "Wango Tango"...mmmmm, it was sooo good...it tasted like a really cold watermelon. Then right before we get up to go to the patio the waitress brings me a drink "on the house" for my b-day. It was a blow job. Never had one of those before. Anyways, so they made me put my hands behind my back and put my mouth over the shot glass and just take it like that. After that the DJ made me and several of the other birthday girls there dance by ourselves....which I did not do. I was drunk but not THAT drunk. My best friend went to the middle and danced with me. I kept ordering drinks and each time the bartender would give me a free drink for my birthday! Which obviously meant I got wasted. But it was a good wasted, I didn't get sick.    January 18th - My actual birthday   The next morning I woke up with a little hangover and not enough sleep. I went to a mexican restaurant to have lunch with my best friend, her sister, her sister's boyfriend, and of course...my boyfriend. I had a "Acapulco Breeze"...also very yummy. The food was deeeeeeeelicious, too! Then the waiter brings me another "on the house" drink. Well...technically it was not a drink it was a shot...Tequilla and lime. So, needless to say I was buzzed again. Then I went to my boyfriend's house and his mom played "Las Ma√±anitas" for me. We had a beer together. Then I went home and spent the evening just talking with my Dad.  That's how I spent my birthday weekend. It was great! I spent it with all of my loved ones.
