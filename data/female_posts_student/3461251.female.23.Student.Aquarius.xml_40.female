I'll find out tomorrow at the doctors! Maybe the lost and confused feelings is just a side of depression that you go through during the after surgery stage? If this is true, I refuse to take some stupid happy pill because it'll go away in time, it always does.  And I'm actually getting a brand new pair of hearing aids. I know to some people think that's no big deal but for someone that's always missing out on things because of being deaf -- This is a HUGE thing. It's so strange though, when I tell someone that I'm getting hearing aids - It's like I want turn red and hide under the table because of being deaf. Why do I feel I should be embarrassed?!?! Yet I know in my head I can't change this.  On top of all this - I have a chance to get back in school, full funding and all. I just don't think I can handle 15 credit hours and pass them with a C or above. I'm terrified but yet I know the reason I failed last time was because....  1. I couldn't hear the teacher. 2. I was uncomfortable as hell and couldn't think straight. 3. I didn't realize how important passing school was until now.  But what if I take this chance and still fail? The fear of the unknown scares the hell out of me and yet I could go under the knife, not knowing if I was going to wake up or not. I'm so weird.  I need to make these decisions and I know I need to make them soon or it'll be to late. Then again maybe for once in my life I'll get something right and I'll be able to move on to a happier and healthier life. The best part about the whole thing - I'll be able to walk away from this hell hole that my parents call "home" and know I did everything possible to make things better for myself. I may of had to ask for help along the way but atleast I made it at the end.
