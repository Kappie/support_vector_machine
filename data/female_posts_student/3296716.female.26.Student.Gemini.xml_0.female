There was a whole  part of the chapter devoted to this with numerous examples.   Another large part of the chapter talked about how it can explain kinship terms. For example, the words we use to define kinship are culturally relevant, and we use certain words and terms to group people into categories, like Aunt/Uncle, cousin, brother/sister. The units of the structure could be identified only in terms of their relationship with other terms. In making up the structure, teh parts define each other, and in defining each other, the parts make a structure.   Chapter 3 was more useful to me. It defined some terms used when talking about linguistics that helped me make sense of how cognition theory was applied. Some words (polysemic words) have more than one meaning- we can mean several different things when using a polysemic word.   Also, our short term memory limits our cognition, because it limits how many things we can identify and remember at a time. Chunking helps us with this- grouping things together. LIke numbers, similar terms. Without chunking we would be extremely limited in what we could discriminate and therefore remember. Analogies also help us with this- they ignore differences in attributes and point out similarity in relationships.
