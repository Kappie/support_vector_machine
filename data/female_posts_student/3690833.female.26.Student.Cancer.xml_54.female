(but, hope is hope however faint.) as a result all the human or humanoid employees are on the brink of a mass exodus. so what, you say? well our old fearless leader used to do the schedule, guess who is doing it now? that's right ladies and gentlemen, yours truly. feeling like a traitor to the human race, i accepted the task of headwait (after they gave it to someone else and then took it back,) and now i am in charge of a handful of righteously pissed humans, some new to this whole drama. but what the borgs do not know is that like myself, another of the managers is actually human. and all hopes for the future of the federation depend on our subterfuge. wish us good luck and godspeed. (really, i am so dramatic sometimes... the whole startrek metaphor could have been bypassed by simply comparing the work situation to a playground screaming match over who is really the goose among all the ducks.)  category 2: money directly relating to the above mediocre crisis, money is tight. i am at work more, but making significantly less. i think the customers can smell the undercurrent of reality tv that is stinking up the place. the waitstaff is surly (more than usual,) and the new people are entering a hostile workplace. the new menu lists about a thousand things we don't have, and the food is completely inconsistent. patrons hate inconsistency- why do you think chain stores are so popular? (maybe the customers are borgs too!) human or not, they aren't coming in as much. (disclaimer: to those who still come in to drink their poison of choice, we appreciate and admire your bravery in light of the borg infestation. we should all hope to display such courage) and with paltry sales comes the other ugly twin, paltry tips. not to mention i have too many people on the floor for training. more people working + less people coming in=less money for all. in addition, school is starting at the end of this month. i was seriously looking forward to the loan disbursement to tide me over. well, sorrrie. disbursement dates have changed. no money is given out until  after  the semester is in session. what the hell sense does that make?? it is  my  money after all. well, eventually i will default on paying it back, right?  category 3: the return of the psycho amid all the aforementioned pleasantry, i get a call from the DA's office friday afternoon. "uh yeah, we are gonna be going to trial on monday, maybe." to which i tactfully reply: " WHAT ?!?!? that is all the notice you can give me? after over a year of waiting for ya'll to get your shit together?" (saying it was tactful reply is called  sarcasm.  say it with me: sar-cas-m. very good.) beautiful timing, man. christ. for those of you who aren't privy to the happenings of my life prior to this blog, i have a bonafide psycho stalker. lucky me. without going into all the gruesome details, (that will be next week) the stalker is still incarcerated and awaiting trial. he has been offered a few plea bargains, (that is an offer to plead guilty to a lesser charge than the felony stalking charge. the state hates to pay for trials and would rather let the psycho go with a measly misdemeanors) but he does not take the plea bargain, because he won't admit to doing anything wrong. the guy is completely delusional. for example: after being put away for stalking me, he continues to write me letters from jail. smart. and the prison still lets him. am i the only one that sees the absurdity here? so anyway... i tell the DA that "monday, maybe" is a tad vague. he says he wont know for sure until the day in question. obviously this is category of problem directly conflicts with the work category. so now i get to explain to the borg chiefs that, thanks for the "promotion" and all, um i may need to schedule myself out next week because of court. you gonna go to jail? no. oh. i can see the confusion this causes the borg community, so i get to explain the stalker thing to them. lucky me. again.  men, borg or otherwise, never seem to believe me about the stalker thing. it is really annoying. my inner monologue always freaks out when i see the look of doubt when this topic arises: who made  you  judge and jury, asshole? you don't know me. you weren't fucking there. and it isn't even any of your fucking business anyway, fucker! it is sad how often this happens. now i know kobe bryant's accuser feels.  anyhoo, i call the DA bright and early monday morning. still no news. 2:30 comes and goes and still no word. i call again. "oh sorry that i didn't call you back. looks like it will be next week afterall, maybe" aaaarrrrrrrgggghhhhhhhhhhh! the world had been overrun with borgs!  category 4: newton's law of motion #3 with all this crap going on there has been equal and opposite reactions to my (already fragile) state of being. i have a constant pain in my stomach, ulcer anyone? more headaches, and various other physical symtoms i don't want to go into. i made a Dr appt, but they were so booked that i get to wait till the end of this month to go, which is also the same day school starts (borgs) of course i have no money to pay them, (student loan borgs) and for all i know i will be in the middle of trial, dredging up last year's misery in front of a bunch of suit and tie types, (bureaucratic borgs) a jury, (some with that doubtful look i'll bet.) and the stalker himself. joy. it doesn't get any better than this folks.  since i haven't been feeling well, and i'm stressed, i do what rational people do. get wasted drunk. as a result, (damn newton) i seem to have abandoned the sensor (censor?) in my brain that tells me to shuttup. lately i have developed this bad habit of telling people exactly what i think- what i think isn't always pretty (as if you couldn't tell.) so if you want to know what i really think of you, just buy me a drink.
