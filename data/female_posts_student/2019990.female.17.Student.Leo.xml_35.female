So why am I writing this instead of working on my homework you might ask?  Well I'll tell you.  I've become quite a fan of procrastinating.  I hate school the stupid "nerd banquet" as Lola so appropriatly put it took four hours out of my night.  And for what? For me to go up on stage for three seconds and have the announcer say Amanda participates in crap, now get off the stage!  I'm sorry, I really shouldn't be communicating with people right now.  I'm going to stop writing and try again when I can be less of a cry baby.  oh that's right I can't cry.  How about just a baby.
