He is overseas now and I pray he is safe. I am a mother of three boys. Two of which are with me and one has been gone for many years. I hope that I can find him soon. The loss of my son has left a hole in my heart. I love to write, my web site has some samples of my writing on it. Though I will never have the courage to submit my writing to be published writing to me is an escape and I enjoy it greatly. We shall see where this leads. I'm not sure if I want people reading my personal stuff but I will see if I can keep the "sensitive stuff" out. So here goes for now.
