We bascially tour round the whole Dover Area...for like 1hr+?....i was really tired and hot!...Came back to sch and had Ice jelly wif christina and daniel. Then after tt, we went for choir...as usual...my poor altos...only 5 ppl turned up...so saddening. Yup,and we are performing tis wed for graduation ceremony. We had to dress in black(which i bet my classmates are goin to laugh at me again...Hahaz)...and poor me...have to skip my Etech lecture tt day. I"ll be performing twice on tt day itself.  WooHoo!!!...Arsenal trashed Everton ytd!!!...Go Gunners!!!
