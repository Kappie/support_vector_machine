Current Music-  Every Breath You Take-The police    EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE-The Police   Every breath you take  And every move you make  Every bond you break, every step you take  I'll be watching you    Every single day  And every word you say  Every game you play, every night you stay  I'll be watching you    Oh, can't you see  You belong to me?  How my poor heart aches   With every step you take  Every move you make  Every vow you break  Every smile you fake, every claim you stake  I'll be watching you    Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace  I dream at night, I can only see your face  I look around, but it's you I can't replace  I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace  I keep crying baby, baby please,   Oh, can't you see  You belong to me?  How my poor heart aches   With every step you take  Every move you make  Every vow you break  Every smile you fake, every claim you stake  I'll be watching you  Every move you make, every step you take  I'll be watching you  I'll be watching you   Listening to this song and just lost in my world of thoughts.Its just one of those days when am feeling extremely low and hiding it all behind a fake smile.I have learnt how to hide my emotions,though have not become perfect at the art but surely my face is not as transparent as it used to be!I always get feel kinda low the week before its time to get back to school but yet am kinda excited to go back.I dont know why this time its very different!I'm not enthusiastic at all.I dont even feel like shopping for school or thinking of what its gonna be like once i get back.Anyways my car incident has really upset me.Its costing 1 lakh bucks to get it repaired!God...though dad hasnt said anything but jokingly he's mentioned it to me thrice about how much its costing and stuff!Now that obviously just shows how upset he is!But now i jusr dont know how to make up for the hurt i have caused to dad.I'm just feeling so sorry about the whole thing.And now before i can even realise times just flying by and its just another 50hrs to go when i'll be on my way back to school!In simple words   I JUST DONT WANT TO GO BACK!  I have no option though but still...I dont know why am reluctant about accepting the fact that its time to part with so many things.But this time a changed AAHNA is going back to so lets just see how things work out.I'm just hoping not to be as miserable as i was in april!I just hated that term so much.But anyways am so sure though GOD seems to be really unhappy with me for only he knows what crime i have committed but life cant get worse than it was that month.And more than anything else i have surely become a tougher person!Today i just dont know what happened but after ages i felt weak inside.The smallest thing brought tears to my eyes.The fact that dad said he wasnt gonna come back home early made me cry.My voice was trembling when i requested him to be back early and the million other things just seemed to make me cry today!Why this is happening I really fail to understand but am just kinda accepting life as it comes.I kinda have started believing in destiny and fate.The stars will never change so whatever has to happen will happen.And I have become superstitious about things.I have never been this way in the past.I wonder whats going on!I just hope that it doesnt get worse.Thats about it for now its 3.45 and am just wondering where people are lost.I cant get any sleep as usual and just wondering what am i gonna do 2 nights from now when am gonna be stuck in CENTRAL JAIL(thats what we call school when it seems to suck)with no time pass to do.hehe...Probably will have to spend just a few more sleep less nights of my life!Used to it and am not asking for a change this time nor am i HOPING for anything miracle to happen.No expactations,No hopes,No dreams for my future.Everything seems to be so blank in front of me...
