And it's strange that things change. But not me wanting you. So desperately.  Oh, why can't I ignore it? I keep giving in, but I should know better. 'Cause there was something 'bout the way you looked at me. And it's strange that things change. But not me wanting you. So desperately.  You looked my way and said "you frustrate me." Like you're thinking of lines and times. When you and I were you and me. We took our chance out on the street. Then I missed my chance. And chances are it won't be coming back to me.  Why can't I ignore it? I keep giving in but I should know better. 'Cause there was something 'bout the way you looked at me. And it's strange that things change. But not me wanting you. So desperately. So desperately.  Why can't I ignore it? I keep giving in but I should know better. 'Cause there was something 'bout the way you looked me. And it's strange that things change. But not me wanting you. So desperately.  I want you so desperately. I keep giving in but I should know better. I keep giving in but I should know better. So desperately. I want you so desperately.
