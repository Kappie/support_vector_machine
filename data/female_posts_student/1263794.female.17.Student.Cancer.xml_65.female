Lets just say I had a realllllly bad weekend before exams and so it made them that much more difficult. My mind was elsewhere throughout all my studying and tests, but I realized you get through things and life goes on.   The afternoon after exams all the SSSs went out and we did the last gift exchange thing, and that was awesome and it SNOWED. (flurries or not it was cool) And we were going to go back to school to play in the parking lot-wow that sounds dumb but it's fun- but yeah as Elaina said stuff happened and we got a little held up. But I realized we have some really awesome teachers at our school.   Then I went back home with Lainer and we got stuck at the pharmacy desk at Harris Teeter for AN HOUR with some lady that we could barely understand. But we made the best of it and it was fun. Then came Elaina's house and we played bunCo and it was good EXCEPT Slotta beat everyone and that is NEVER exceptable. (Till next time Dutchie) But yeah that day was...full of events.  Last night I saw the show at RLT and it was awesome. Actually it was a really strange show but I enjoyed it. I also got to see some people I haven't seen for a while as well and that's always nice.   But yeah that's basically been the last week for me.
