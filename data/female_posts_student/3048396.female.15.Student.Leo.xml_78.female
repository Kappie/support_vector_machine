Yeah...*Sigh* Well Kait and I finally got up and moving..we've been awake for like 3 hours but we just laid there and talked...bout what shes gettin me for my birthday and random stuff. Amusing. So yeah we didnt go to bed till lik 6 so we got I think 4 hours of sleep. Yeah. Great stuff...So yesterday was boring until we picked her up. We ate and talked...talked all the way home watched a few movies and talked all night. Yeah it was great fun. So yeah....its probably my turn for the shower now so I'll just head now....
