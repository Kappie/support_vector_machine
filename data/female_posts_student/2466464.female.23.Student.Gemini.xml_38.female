(1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle)  i'd say for my public life it would be 5, privately 9.3   #4 ... what's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky?  i don't know, too many good things have happened as a result of a bold action   #5 ... and what's the worst?  i don't know that i want to talk about the worst thing ... i don't think there have been too many bad things, but i can't recall at present
