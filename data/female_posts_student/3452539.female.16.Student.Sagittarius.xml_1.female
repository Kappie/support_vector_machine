I, myself, decided to save myself some dignity and did not look for shorts or anything or that sort and bought two shirts -green and white-, along with a belt that includes buttons of Einstein, a robot, and one that says "COFFEE NOW" lol. Perfect for Battlecry.   Then, stopped in to wish my brother well in his new home in Atlanta, Georgia with Laine (who was away working).  Nextly, went to see  The Day After Tomorrow . Definitely not what it is cracked up to be, trust me.  Following, played pool at A's to kill time before next movie. Please not that I did horribly. A few nice shots here and there, but that was all.  Lastly, went to see  Van Helsing . The parts I saw did not seem very spectacular but I do not wish to give much of an opinion as seeing that I slept through seriously 85%. However, I did see about 10%. The other 5%, I was outside the theatre in the lobby or on the phone lol. Greeeat.   Got home around 1:08AM after a quick pit stop at Dunkin Donuts.   Now, I am about to fall asleep here typing. Therefore, I am going to get something to drink, as seeing that I am terribly thirsty, and then go to sleep, as seeing that I have to wake up at 6:15AM in order to get to the high school for 7AM to load up stuff to get to Suffield a short time later to decorate the truck and march in that parade. Then, rush back to Windsor Locks and march again. Rain is expected, folks.   Good night  -J9
