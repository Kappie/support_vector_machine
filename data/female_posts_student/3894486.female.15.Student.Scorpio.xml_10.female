First off I am officially(spelling ?) ungrounded! yaya! it feel so great to be ungrounded! well I cleaned most of the day and danielle came over for a little while..then I cleaned some more and headed to the edge youth church cookout at pb munincipal park...we played some basketball and I had a really good hotdog! then I came home...went running and got see my alex..he walked me home and he pinky swore he would come over tomorrow...I'm really sad that this is our last week together...I'm gonna miss him sooo much! I wish he could move here but I know he can't stay here...he just sees the person inside behind the smile and well I love that about him...kinda like ashlee simpsons new song(I hate her but I like this song)   "Fall with you I fall so fast   I can finally catch my breath   I hope it lasts   Oh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real   and I like the way that feels   Oh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself   and I love how you can tell all the pieces of me"      *sigh*I'm gonna miss my alex...I'll post a pic of us once I take one tomorrow...thats if he comes over...urgh he better!   well I think I'm gonna go shower and head to bed so I can wake up and make myself look pretty in the morning...
