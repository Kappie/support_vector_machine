Where do broken hearts go Can they find their way home Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there And if somebody loves you Won't they always love you I look in your eyes And i know that you still care for me  I've been around enough to know That dreams don't turn to gold And that there is no easy way No you just can't run away And what we had was so much more Than we ever had before And no matter how i try I can't get you of my mind So here i am, and can you please tell me  Where do broken hearts go Can they find their way home Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there And if somebody loves you Won't they always love you I look in your eyes And i know that you still care for me  Now that i am here with you I'll never let you go I look into your eyes And now i know Now i know   ::A very nice song sang by whitney houston, haha.. all thanks to my dayima for helping me to dl tt song. So where do broken hearts go? i believe tt 1 day they will manage to find a sturdy house which can prevent them from getting hurt again...::
