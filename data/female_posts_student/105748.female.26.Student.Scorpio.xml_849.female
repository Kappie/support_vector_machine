Fields lets Brando do the dirty work, as he drinks and wisecracks his way through the adventure, surreptitiously writing a movie script about it, which he hopes to sell.  Attempting to sell the script leads to its own set of adventures, where Brando returns the "favor", offering Fields no help as one misfortune after another befalls him.  Ching, I'm in for a quarter a pin.  Bowl good!    I briefly considered coming up with a movie title that began with  Frankenstein , but rejected it.  And  Breakdance  would have been funnier than  Missouri Breaks  for a second movie, but the title was actually  Breakin' .
