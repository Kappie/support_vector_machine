I didn't notice anything odd, but I searched my C:Drive for the files that they mentioned anyway -- better to be safe, than sorry.  I wasn't infected.  I'm sure that even if I didn't infect you guys, someone else on your email list might have acquired it and you may still be at risk.  Help yourselves by keeping informed and, more importantly, keeping your virus definitions up-to-date (I know everyone hates that -- I hate it too).
