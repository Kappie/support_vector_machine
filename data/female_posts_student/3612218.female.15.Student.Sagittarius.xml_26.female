If we weren't meant to be, then tell me so.. I promise I'll leave and never question. Just dont do this to me. At least give me a reason, an answer to everything. Dont lead me on to something unreal.. If u have feelings for me, then why am i feeling this way? Why am i treated this way? I feel somewhat like a fool.. Are u still the one? Will u still be there? Will I still be able to watch u sleep?   Maybe its just me who is thinking alot.. Well, maybe..      I miss you alot alot..   Dont tell me you're leaving me. I really dont wan to know that.I need you, baby. I really do need you.But if that's the way it is then so be it..
