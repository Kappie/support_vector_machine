Oh, man Jay has a white ass...and we messed with the mircophones in the green room, which got all the techies pissed, but it's fun to overhear convos...especially guys'. I'm so tired :::yawn::: and I'm in some serious pain...mmm vicodin and sleep...  Yeah I should be doing my homework and studying for my tests, but fuck homework, fuck school, fuck Mr. Flowers, I give up. As you can tell I'm so stressed, but no worries, it's not like I'm going to slash my wrists or anything...lol the irony in that statment...hey its has been 15 DAYS!!!!!!!! Go me!!!!!!
