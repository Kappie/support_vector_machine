I have miraculously recovered from the cold that had been plauging me the past few days. I'm lucky. I'm really mad because I wanted to go to the jazz concert last night, but I'm getting my hair done, so I can't. Grr, lots of my friends are in it and I really wanted to go. Damn, that sucks. Anyways, I'm getting highlights and lowlights in my hair tonight, so it should look real cool tomorrow. I was angry today because I got a B+ on my Biology test. I was sure I was going to get an A. Yuck. Looks like my grades won't be as great as they were last semester at this time. I think I'll have 2 Bs. That really, really sucks. That's ok, I'll bring them up before the semester ends. Today in wind ensemble, Mr. Snoeck told us that Perkins left because he "didn't think he could be successful." What does that mean? There had to be a bigger reason than that. Whatever. I guess they have to redo the entire interview process again. That sounds like fun. Not.
