My brother's wedding had been the day before, so I was hungover. I remember we went to a party after the reception, so we got home late. Then I had to take all the bobby pins out of my hair and get out of my bridesmaid dress. And the crinoline was really loud and crinkly and I felt bad because I'm sure we wokeup everyone in the house when we came home.  And although we were hungover, we couldn't sleep in the next day because we had togo to church, of course. And then there was the gift opening in the afternoon. And I found out that I was the only member of my immediate family (including my father  and  little brother) who didn't get hit on at the wedding (it didn't really matter because I was planning to move soon, but still!). And then family was going home. And my sister and I stayed in PEI for a little while longer.  And now I'm in Vancouver. Waiting for my own engagement ring. And the happy couple who has now been married for over 3 years is expecting a baby any day now. Crazy. It all seems like yesterday.  And the worst part is I've never worn the dress since, although I really love it.
