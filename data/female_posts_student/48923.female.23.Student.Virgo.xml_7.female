Her 13 scenes via a multi-media approach were clever to the point of irony! A thinking person's comedienne! Get an agent and shamelessly self-promote--you're a winner and more audiences need to see your talent!"  Squee!  And, a photo of Leigha in the beer tent at the Montreal Fringe, swiped from  urlLink Matthew Foster's  blog:
