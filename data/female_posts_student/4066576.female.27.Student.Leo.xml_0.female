I ran into the coffee shop after work with lots of fruits and vegitables for free.  Those were from my work. My co-worker gave me some of fruits and vegitables whenever I work over there. I really appreciate her help and taking care about me. If I were her, I could not do like her. I should learn how to treat someone like her.  I met Jay at the coffee shop near streetcar stop in Jarvis street.   We were very hungry so, we took a streetcar for having dinner in a Korea Town. Our menu was "Gam-Ja Tang" which is korean soup. It was so delicious. We got home around 8:30pm. I already took a shower. Therefore, I feel so fresh and I am ready to sleep.   Now, It's 9:30pm.   My roommate, Jay told me that she prepared some soup and side dishes for tomorrow morning meal for me while I was taking a shower in a bath. I know she wanted to take a shower, too. But, She made some food for me because I have to wake up early tomorrow. My work will be from 7:00am to 6:00pm.  I feel so sorry to her and thank her a lot. And She is waiting right now for using internet after me. Everything is after me for her. How can I be her best friend? Maybe, I will never be her friend just as a younger sister. And She usually take care of me. Thank you Jay.   I don't know how to say for this great support. Just thank that is what I can say to her right now.  Wow... It's 10:07pm. I should go to bed now. I have to wake up at 5:00am tomorrow.  She is eating some korean snack which we bought in Christie after dinner. She quite enjoy that. I am so happy to see that. Whenever she eat something, It looks so cute and happiness in her face. Especially, when she have lots of whipping cream on her coffee. KKKK...
