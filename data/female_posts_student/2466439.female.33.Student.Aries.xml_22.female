I certainly want the man to win, but he does look like an Ent.   urlLink  http://www.johnkerry.com/index.html           The truth is I don't like Kerry very much. He's way too conservative and he says he doesn't support queer marriage, which is my issue. I'm not a particularly big fan of Edwards, either.      But I certainly won't even entertain the idea of voting for Bush. Bush is evil. Ashcroft is worse. Cheney is a prick. This country will be better off without them. I will personally be better off without them. I sure do hope they get voted out.
