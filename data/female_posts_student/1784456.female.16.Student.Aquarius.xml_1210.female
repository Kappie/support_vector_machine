Oops... I got   MANGA!   (Now what's the tag for bright flashing lights surrounding it again?) Ah well. And some cool tops! Yeay! So, overall I'm a very happy floppy bunny! Ahhha but a funny thing happed! (sigh) We were being all good and hoho like so we decided to buy some presents for this kid (you get given a tag) where they couldn't usually have presents or something... (Hey, do I usually make sense) But we bought two foreign swear words books and we accidently gave them in with the books for the boy! Geez! My mum bets that some one's gonna write into the independent and blabber on! But if any one asks, it wasn't us! Yes... err... my name is Isobel Tarr. Please complain to Isobel Tarr. (Muhahahaaa!)
