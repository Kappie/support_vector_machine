Teehee. >oP      We're having some kinda seminar about use of make-up next Wednesday. At school. It's like, thanks for the reaffirmation that  I'm ugly !! Honestly..just when I was starting to realise my  inner beauty  they remind me that I need make-up... Stupid school...      *breathes and thinks happy thoughts* Today's Lasagne Day! (Every Friday, they have lasagne at the canteen.) I'd get two, but I only have $2.60 in my pocket.. Oops. I'll be prepared next Friday.      Does anyone know how to sing "Someone To Watch Over Me"? I'm planning to sing it at the talent show heat.      Kate is posting a comment on my last post, so I'd better publish this before she sends it...
