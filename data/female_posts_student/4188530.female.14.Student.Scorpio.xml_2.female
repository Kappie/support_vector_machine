Although in band I was put on the spot by playing this melody part and I can play it, but I get so nervous. Stupid. Why can't everyone just turn around or leave the room. Oh well. Beggers can't be choosers. I think I might've put that in my blog somewhere else but I can't remember. Yeah. Things are normal, but this one thing. It's not that important anyways just caught me off guard. Hmm... I don't really feel like typing to make an point so I'm going to have some chicken. Ok today's message always look both ways before crossing the street.
