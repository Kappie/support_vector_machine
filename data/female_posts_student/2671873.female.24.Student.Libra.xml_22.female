Or why when you ask someone to ring you if they are going out or have a party they don't and ask why you weren't there.  Is this common, or is it just a simple way of being self absorbed.  Either way it drives me crazy.  Oh well.  I am off to Montana on Thrusday and can't wait!  Get to catch up with some old friends and get away from some of the silly shit going on here in Ireland.  Although short and sweet it will be loads of fun!
