Because my friends, particularly one, do not seem to appreciate it when I write anything that branches off from my personal life - though there is one such personal facet of my life that I find I will probably be more comfortable writing about in here, as it's this place that will remain known to myself only.   So I found this site a few days ago while I was working on my social project.    urlLink  Here     I found it disgusting, but the final blow for me had to be this photo.          Whether or not you support homosexuals is up to you. Personally, I support them full heartedly.      I can deal with people calling my gay friends  faggots . I can deal with people calling me a "fuckin' homo" just because I support homosexuals and same-sex marriage. It's not to say that I like it and that I think that it's a-okay to do so.      But no stance validates what these people in the photo are doing.      It's an insult to those who lost their lives in 9/11 and it most definetely is an insult to homosexuals.         Discrimination towards homosexuals is no difference from racism. Discrimination is discrimination.      You call one person a "faggot", you might as well call me a "chink" while I'm passing by.      What is the difference between these people carrying signs that say "fag sin = 9/11" than Ku Klus Klan members and their burning crosses?      So it seems that homophobia is more socially acceptable than racism, when in reality it is no different.         I've come to terms that I cannot change people's minds about homosexuals. I cannot make them support same-sex marriage, let alone make them accept homosexuals. It's a near impossible feat I fear. What can I do to undo all that they have learned because of their upbringing? Not much.      However I will never come to terms to people who act out their homophobic opinions in such derogatory ways.      You don't support homosexuals. Fine. You can tell me that and you can tell me why and I can respect your opinion even if I don't agree with it.      But do not go around calling people, my friends, "faggots" thinking that it's okay. It's the equivalent to calling someone a racial slur and why it's socially acceptable to call a homosexual that is beyond me. I guess it's because homophobia in accordance to homosexuality has become socially acceptable.         I find it ridiculous how some people act so radically.      Countless times I have talked to people who are homophobic. Countless times I have come across the same issue among the issue.      A question I always ask is, if you had a good friend who later came out to you that sh/e was gay/lesbian - what would you do?      The answer most common is varied but always comes down to the fact that they would abandon their good friend, because of their sexual orientation.      Of course the answers I get are usually much more crude and shocking. The most memorable one has to be the time a guy said that he would get a bunch of his other friends and beat the gay "friend" until he became straight.      Which, as anybody would know, is unlikely. People just don't become straight, become gay - switching back and forth.      So this person would be willing to physically hurt and mentally scar their good friend on the basis that yes, they like people of the same sex.         I find that disgusting, and it's things like that that I encounter that make me the pessimistic person that I am.      What kind of a person are you when you are willing to abandon your friend based on their sexual orientation?         You let social norms guide who you like, who you are friends with. And it's shame really - because you are missing out and will never meet some great people.      Some of the greatest persons I've ever had the fortune to meet are gay or are bisexual.       I feel sorry for people who are willing to judge others by their sexual orientation.            Branching off from that topic, I had the misfortune to stumble upon a quite jarring incident today.      I was on a music forum. A simple music forum. There was a girl who wrote a forum on the band "Soul Decision" and how they came out with a new single.      I know of the band, and though they aren't exactly my favorite - it doesn't really bother me that this girl wrote the forum.      Inside the forum though, there were 2 idiots who decided it would be amusing to bash this girl.      "Fuk you"   "by the way, your ugli" (surely he meant "you're" and "ugly")      And such not so intelligent things like that. But the part that got me is when one of them started throwing around the word "paki".      I wrote that the ignorance of those two astounded me and how terribly brainless it is to single out a person and insult them based on their ethnicity.      I recognized those two from other forums based primarily around "America bashing" - which centralized on how America is a "hick town" full of racist "rednecks" and "retards".      If that is their view of America, than really - how much better is Canada when such people like them live here? I probably hit a nerve, but at that point I could really care less.         Of course one of them has to write back how they can write whatever they want whenver they want and that they can call this girl a "paki" or anybody else that.      Yeah you can. Such is the beauty of the right of freedom of speech. But isn't it that right only extends so far when other people become hurt by it? Possibly not - but it doesn't really matter.      I know I can never stop racism and racial slurs always being thrown about. But the fact of the matter is that the forum was based on such a trivial matter. Music. Maybe you didn't like her music choice, but that gives no validation to start insulting her.      In the end I told him I encouraged him to do so. Because although he might find it amusing and powerful, others will be given the chance to quickly see just how ignorant he is without having to go through the misfortune of getting to know him.      In the end, it'll be his affinity with using racial slurs that will get him in trouble. If not with different people he says it to, then with his future.      It looks bleak to say at the least.
