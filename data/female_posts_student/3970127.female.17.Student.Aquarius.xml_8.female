"  and  "It is by those very clouds that the Spirit of God is teaching us how to walk by faith. If there were no clouds, we should have no faith. "  and "The clouds are a sign that He is there. What a revelation it is to know that sorrow and bereavement and suffering are the clouds that come along with God! God cannot come near without clouds, He does not come in clear shining. "  This is a devos from a few days ago, but it was nabbing away at my subconscience (sp?). I've been thinking a lot about it because a friend was going through a rough time, basically asking, "Where is God? Why isn't He near?" and another friend has had a really rough year, not being on fire or motivated, and just struggling. So it really stood out about unlearning, and also how God does not come in clear shining. Just thinking about obediance  faith. :-) This is what I was thinking about today whilst I was walking Ryan up at La Dole, and it was so beautiful, the sun shining, with no clouds. (it was b-e-a-utiful)...sigh.   On a lighter note: Happy 1st of August (The Fete National of Switz). I'm going to my commune's dinner tonight, to show my face, (I have been accepted by the federal, and its now back to the commune to be voted on in Sept for my Swiss naturalisation!!!!!).
