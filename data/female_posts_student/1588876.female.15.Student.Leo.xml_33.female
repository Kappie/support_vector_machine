Cannon Beach or Seaside? Cannon is where all my fellow incubus friends are and where the kitchy little boutiques are. Seaside is more touristy- outlet shops (gap, nike, etc.), and other fun stuff. im leaning more towards Cannon- i could probably get some cool stuff at LuLu's. but, on the other hand, i need some pants for school...and i can get them inexpensive at the outlet stores...hmmm...  *ponder ponder ponder*
