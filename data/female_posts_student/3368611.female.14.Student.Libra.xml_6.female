Welcome to SmookieLand, the most mediocre place on Earth!! I'm your non-magical, high-pitched voice, annoying guide through the depths of the sick mind that creates this that IS... SMOOKIELAND!! YAY!!  *I walk up, look at the cartoon for a minute, then pick it up, beat the living daylights out of it, then drop it on the ground and kick it in its side before screaming "I'M RICK JAMES, BEEYOTCH!!". Douche-Bag cartoon looks up, dazed, bruised, and missing around six teeth*   Douche-Bag Cartoon : Ugh... see boys and girls? This is the essence of SmookieLand... ooh... I need a doctor...  *I shove the cartoon down a storm drain*   Me : Sorry about that, y'all. Stupid cartoons, run up in here thinking they can take this place over like roaches. This ain't no crackhouse!! *points to the huge bricks of cocaine behind her* See? That's COKE, not CRACK. BIG difference. Duh. Okay, so some people don't exactly get what SmookieLand is... I mean, that douche-bag carton tried, but when's the last time you've learned something worth knowing from a douche-bag? Exactly. Let's analyze the facts...   SMOOKIE (n.) (SMOOH-kee)- A stupid, lovable nickname given to me by my best friend Brandi to make me feel special.  See Also : Smookie G-Flow, Honey, Mookie, Boomalamah, BabyGirl,  , The Poetrist, and anything else synonymous with ME...   LAND (n.) (LAH-nd)- The solid ground of the earth.   See? SOO much clearer. Crystal clear... I mean, it is to me, it should be to you... shOoo... if it isn't, then you must be  "Sofa King Wee Todd Ed"....  say that a few times really fast and you'll figure out what I mean...   Anyways, down to business.... I made this blog because I'm bored... so this will be where I regurgitate the crap that I think up everyday.... so, in other words, this will be one of the most hilarious, yet morbid and mundane blogs in the entire history of Blogdom... ooh, is Blogdom a word? If it isn't, then it is NOW!! WOO!!! TAKE THAT WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY!!! lol.... Okay, so now I'm going to do my daily... umm.. things....      CURRENT EVENTS     1)  I kissed Kaseem (on the cheek.... SO SHUT UP TO EVERYONE WHO CALLED ME NASTY OR BAD.... shOo... oh, and Brandi... lmao @ that lip inspection thang...)   2)  Fontaine asked for muh phone number.... I mean, I already have his, but it's whatever...   3)  I got an 83 average in school... I'm going out with a bang, though. Garry and I made a pact to finish up the school year with nothing less than a 90 average.   4)  I'm signing up for like two programs... both will look good on muh college application (I'm only in ninth grade, but, but one is more recreation and the other is like ALL      SHOUT-OUTS     1)  MICHAEL   for buying me fudge chocolate cookies at lunch time...
