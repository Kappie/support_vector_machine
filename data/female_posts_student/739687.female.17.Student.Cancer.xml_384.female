Ya heeaaaar me?  :)  Oops. Forgot my Actonel again. GOD DAMMIT. I'm supposed to take it on Sundays but yesterday as soon as I woke up I took my Zoloft and a Clarinex. Big no-no before taking Actonel. Then this morning I ate a donut as soon as I woke up. Another no-no. I just hate having to wake up once a week, be tired as hell, take that stupid pill with a full glass of water...and then I have to put everything on hold for 30 minutes. No eating, no drinking, no taking medicine, no laying down. For 30 minutes. So dumb.  Well, I guess the new day for Actonel will have to be Tuesday. :- Whoops.  And my counselor called this morning to tell me there was a conflict with my schedule. Grrrr. Comparative Government and French 5 are only offered at one time...the same time, of course. So I dropped Comparative Government. :(  *tears* I actually wanted to take that freaking class. I mean seriously. I did. I wanna major in Political Science for Christ's sake...of course I wanted to take that class. But I also want to double major...in Political Science and  International Relations.   Yes. And it seems thatalthough the 2 compliment each other quite nicely in the real world, they conflict with one another at f-ing Keller High School.  Okay okay. Enough is enough.  Oh oh. I burned this kick ass cd last night. It's all country songs about drinking. And I'm going to listen to it whenever I'm intoxicated. Heavily. And sing along and be merry.  And I'll even listen to it when I'm sober.  Bitches.  Okay, crazies, ride em high.
