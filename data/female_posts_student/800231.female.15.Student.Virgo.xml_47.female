L: "Angela, she treats you badly and uses you for sexual favors. You are definitely her bitch." Damn her, she's right... Oh well, to Lucia is always an interesting experience.  Lucia: "I want to be just like that one lady on "CSI:Miami" some day." Me: "Which one?" Lucia "You know, that one lady who stands around in the morgue all day fondling the dead people."  It's really embarrassing when you get caught spying on your neighbors... I'm still obsessed with that one guy that lives behind me, he's bloody hot. He and a couple of his friends were working on his motorcycle earlier and he was riding it around in circles behind my house. I was watching out of my bedroom window figuring he wouldn't bother to look up at my house. Well, he didn't but his friend did. So there I am leaning on my window sill and staring at Tim (not his actual name) and the entire time his friend was standing in the shadows watching me. Good lord, when I finally noticed him I backed up really fast making a further asshat of myself. Lovely.  Well, I feel like dancing or something. Must have been the 5 cups of coffee I just drank. I'm off to bounce off walls for a few hours.
