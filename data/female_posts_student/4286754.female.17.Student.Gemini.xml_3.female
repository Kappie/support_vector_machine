How I met him:  He's a friend of my cousin Pam. He's been chasing  her  for the past year now, up until he saw me at a party. When I say saw, I mean  SAW.  He didn't talk to me or anything. Anyways, a few days after that he added me to MSN. More about the Pam thing: She's been telling me how awful he is and how much unwanted attention she gets from him for the last year. Then as soon as I told her about Justin liking me, she starts encouraging me to go after him! Like jeeze, why would I want someone that she said was horrible?   What happened after:  After talking to me twice, he asked if I wanted to go to the movie with him on Saturday in a neighboring town. I panicked >. One-on-one interactions with anyone, excluding my closest friends, scare the bejesus out of me. Its something I really need to work on, but for the time being I'm sort of stuck. So as the week progressed, I began to dread the weekend. I couldn't imagine driving with a guy I hardly knew for an hour each way to go to a movie. I even have trouble making conversation with some of my friends for that long! So on Thursday, when I was talkin to Justin, I sorta hinted that I was seeing someone else. He caught on and never mentioned the movie again.  I know I should've been honest and told him the truth: that I wasn't interested. But I couldn't, cause y'see, I've lost a lot of good friends like that. Like take for example my friend Colin. Colin and I have been friends our whole lives. One day, he shows up at my door and says he has to talk to me about something. Next thing I know, he's confessed that he loves me! I told him right then and there that I didn't like him like that. ...that was pretty much the last full conversation I had with Colin.  I respect guys for taking a chance and going for it...but I'd wish that they'd at least check with one of my friends or something to see if the feeling was mutual. Or stop and think for a second, cause in no way did I give Colin reason to believe that I liked him.  I guess I thought that if I don't give Justin a straight answer then he won't give up. I'd like to have him as a friend, just not necessarily a boyfriend. As a rule of thumb, I MUST be friends with someone before anything else can happen, otherwise it will be an unhealthy relationship.  Comments are welcomed. Criticism too, as long as its fair.  ~Virginia  PS...
