I'm pretty sure that tonight my brother and I will watch a movie and eat some chicken and dumplings.  He's had a rough day at work... and seems pretty stressed out.  Thank goodness my Mom sent food, because now neither he or I have to worry about cooking something.  :-)  Anyhow, tomorrow we're going to eat at the Hobbit Hole restaurant here!  I'm so excited, because it's just fun to be in a restaurant themed after Tolkien's cute little creatures.  Maybe I should brush up on some elvish, have a line prepared...  haha  YEAH, RIGHT!  Anyhow, I'm just going to go relax some more tonight... bust out the guitar and play some stuff... wait for my brother to get home, he should be here within the next 30 mins.  His apartment is SO nice!  It's huge, it has vaulted ceilings... and it's just NICE.  He's got it decorated all nicely.  Only weird thing is there's all these little yellow sticky notes all over from Kathy to him saying "I love you... ALWAYS!!!  :-D"  AHHHHH!!!  Well, at least I can pretend that she loves ME always, too... ;-)  Anyhow, I'll post more either tomorrow night, or Sunday after I get home to update about how Saturday goes... especially Blast!  Talk to you kiddies later!  :-)       urlLink  postCount('10Jan2003');
