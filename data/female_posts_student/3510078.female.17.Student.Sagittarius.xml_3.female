To be unreachable, no need to show feelings. Hiding everything inside you. Chances are you are already used to it. You say to yourself that you don't need anyone, that you stand on your own two feet or that you don't have time for these things. But in bitter reality, you are scared to get hurt. You feel safe where you are: by yourself; no one can hurt you there. You invent your own relationships in your dreams. The only thing you (think you) need to know is just if you COULD get a partner. That's it.    urlLink     Wow.  Surprisingly, and sadly, this isn't too far off...makes me sound pretty stupid, but I guess I haven't been kicking my own ass for no reason if this really does describe me.  Oh well. In the meantime, I remain a quiz FIEND! yay for quizilla.
