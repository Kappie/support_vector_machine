I simply can't understand Texas weather; one minute it's 29 degrees, the next it's 65.  It's as if our particular climate can't make up its damn mind.  I bought advanced tickets for The Return of the King~ Wednesday at 12:30pm :-D  I am so excited about this third and last movie!!!  ::jumps up and down::  I can't wait to finish the Tolkein books over the holidays...  I'm off to go take a hot shower, drink hot chocolate, and admire the Christmas tree.
