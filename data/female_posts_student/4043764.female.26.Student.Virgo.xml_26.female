Though they were seniors and had just a little bit more experience in the world, they never noticed that twinge in Mr. Blankenship-Brown's voice, the one that suggested that what he was saying might be on the test. In my typical Cassandra way, I would say, "Obviously this is on the test." He would reply, "Maybe so, but no one is listening to you. You're a bleeping Cassandra."  Thus is my fate. I am keeping my predictions to myself. But my main one right now is that boy really thinks that a woman would be with him, just to pass time... He thinks that a woman would put up with his whining, his baggage, his ex-girlfriendlove and cheating, no sex. AND that she would not expect that her efforts would result in something fruitful (i.e. committed relationship, sex, whatever). Humans are stupid and we have stupid notions. One that is gender-specific is this: "Oh, I can help him through this. I can be that solid rock. I can *change* him." Ok, whatever. It's bullshit. My other favorite: "I'm too good for her, she's putting up with me. I've got to let her love me." More bullshit. Grow some pubes, get some self-esteem, spend some time with yourself and figure out what it is that you want. Stop wasting other people's time.  Maybe I shouldn't write about relationships anymore.
