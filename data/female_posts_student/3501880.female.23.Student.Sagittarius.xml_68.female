Why is this guy still famous?  I get it, okay. He is somewhat attractive. I have to admit that my loins did a little jump when I saw him butcher an Irish accent in  FarAway . I found him a bit charming and likeable in  Jerry McQuire . And though I haven't seen it, I can accept that he might have done a decent job in  Magnolia .  But please, I can't stand that people seem to take this man seriously as an actor. I know in your heart of hearts you don't, but it seems like everyone is giggling nervouslyand agreeing that Tom Cruise might be worthy of an Oscar, because everyone else seems to think so. It's dogma, folks!Cast off this antiquated notion that began sometime in the early to mid- eighties, I implore you.  Don't be fooled by Nancy O'Dell on Access Hollywood marching with a picket sign reading, "Tom Got Robbed" after last year's Oscar nominations. Don't let Oprah sway you into thinking that he convincingly conveys an ounce of emotion or believeability.Tom Cruise cannot act his way out of a soaking wet paperbag.  Yesterday, my friend, Kristin, and I went to the movies where we saw a preview for his new movie,  Collateral . I went off into my usual rant about why they keep making Tom Cruise run in movies:   Me : Oh, God! He's a terrible runner. They  always  make him run in movies!   Kristin : Yeah, even if he was playing a parapalegic, they would still probably make him run.   Me : Thank God, he didn't star in  My Left Foot !   While watching Access Hollywood this week, they had coverage of the Espy Awards, where Tom Cruise gave a tribute to Ron Tillman. Who's fucking idea was that? I could only stand to watch about 5 seconds of Tom Cruise trying to be serious and touching and trying to have respect for the dead.   In short, I wish Tom Cruise would go away again, but not to make Mission Impossible: 3 either. I just fear that if he were to ever die, he would have a bigger funeral than Reagan.  ******** Last night, I went to a sex toy party. Sounds interesting, right? To be honest, it kind of sucked ass. I have found in my experience that there is nothing worse than being surrounded by dildos and hicks. The combinations DOES NOT work.   I arrived late with my friend, so I had about 20 vibrators shoved in my direction in the span of about five minutes. There is nothing cool or sexy about trying to juggle a bunch of vibrators in your hands.  Then, after things began to die down, the conversation turned toward current events. The hicks pretended to have an educated opinion about what we SHOULD have done in Iraq, which consisted of going in there, "cleaning house", then helping ourselves to 75% of the oil reserves for "saving their fucking country." I just about puked in my sex toy catalog I pretended to be so engrossed in. I would have prefered to have that arm-sized phallus shoved up my unlubricated ass than have had to witness that conversation.
