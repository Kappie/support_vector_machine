She's my former classmate at csa, we two are close! as in! we two eat together tuwing lunch, we share food (kasi we both love tempura!)  sabay kami lumabas ng school.. The sad part is, she need to go to Singapore due to her parent's business thingy..argh! But know.. mag-ka chat na kami sa ym.. And im so happy na! kasi nalaman kong uuwi sya here! now, all i have to do is wait for her to arrive!
