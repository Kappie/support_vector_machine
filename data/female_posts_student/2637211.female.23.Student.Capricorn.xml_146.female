Nothing too exciting, no big fights or anything special. Just nice sunny days, some knitting and some studying. Oh, and a lot of sleep. A whole lot of necessary sleep. Man, last week killed me. This week ought to be somewhat more relaxed, despite a final and a paper. It won't be too hard to get through.
