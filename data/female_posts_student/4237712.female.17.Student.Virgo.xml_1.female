Currently working on government and economics like the busy little bee that I am (so what if I'm half-heartedly watching VH1 and listening to Weezer and eating pot roast and playing with my new Tamagotchi and so on.) that's right. Busy little goddam bee.  Speaking of Tamagotchi's, I just got the new generation of "Tamagotchi Connection" toys... I know what you're thinking- what a nerd, why would anyone want such a faggoty little responsibility? To which I reply... meh. I don't care. I am a nerd. And they're fun. So there.  In addition to a bigger screen and a price of only $14, they now come with the ability to make friends and even mate (finally a love child with Dylan!) to create new generations of your pet. You can have up to 50 friends, so I'm hoping everyone will get one, and we can get the lovin' on...
