Anyway...today...today was good because of lunch and Nick having a tad too much fun with the oyster crackers. (If anyone can sheed light on why they are called oyster crackers that would be great.) I was so greatly amused by him today. Uh really nothing better realy happened. I was in a bad mood today I guess. For no reason. Uh...now I am jsyt felling guilty because I didn't do my math homework because I couldn't concentrate. And I have this rock collection due Friday which I haven't started. AHHHHHH!!!!!! Sure..they let us off the Whole year and then they throw it at us...Eguh...Yeah. Going to see if i can do something on my rock collection...
