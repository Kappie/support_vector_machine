It completely changed the way I listen to FFF. All the songs he played just seem different. I was front row, center. John and met made eye to eye contact a lot of times. It was amazing. Let me try to remember the songs played: NYC Weather Report Devil In The Wishing Well Bella's Birthday Cake Angels  Girlfriends 100 Years Easy Tonight Maybe I Something About You If God Made You The Taste Superman (It's Not Easy) Nobody The concert was a blast! And John is an amazing person. I hope and pray to God that I am lucky enough to meet him again. He is truly my hero, and I hope for nothing but greatness for him. And if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have meet Matt, who is also amazing  urlLink   And he is the SWEETEST guy! And through Matthew, I found Elly K, who is also awesome. Both are piano/keyboard/singers/songwriters (wow! LOL) urlLink   Anyways, I need to be going. I'll Write later!  ~~Breena
