I seem to get mad or upset real super easy. So since Jake is here, I just take it out on him since he is the one that puts me in a bad mood half the time today and its only 3. I think that I might blow dry my hair and stuff and go pick up my check and put gas in the truck...but then I have to put on desent clothes and I really dont feel like doing that either. I think I might just leave and go to cleburne and watch a movie or something or just go to wal-mart and walk around. So well I guess thats all I have right now...just felt like I needed to talk to someone is all and yall are always here to listen...so ya know. Till then, Later Days
