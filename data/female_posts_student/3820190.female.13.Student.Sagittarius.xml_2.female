I really don't know why I keep on seeing "him" since this Monday!! I just saw "him" when I was at the bus-stop!! Luckily the bus came at that time or I would have not know what to say to "him"!! I guess Shurn  was  right when he said that I could still have some feelings for "him"..   There was this "Hand-over Ceremony" last Wednesday and since then the Choir had seemed smaller and more quiet than usual.. We learnt a new song, though..It's  You Raise Me Up,  played by Secret Garden and sung by Josh Groban. When I first heard this name(Josh). it reminded me of my old classmate, Joshua.. Wonder if I will see him again on Teachers' Day..   The swimmingcourse started this Monday.. IHATE SWIMMING!!! Why can't the schoolbe more affectionate and let me off?! And now i'll have to buy a new suit just because of that!!   BIG DEAL!!     I think that will be all.. Until next time!!
