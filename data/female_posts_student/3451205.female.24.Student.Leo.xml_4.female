Well, for those of you out there who are in love with someone but are afraid to tell them, please, take my advice, and get over your shyness and shout it out loud. I've spent one year with a perfect guy but didn't realize it because, as we all do, I was hoping to get more than I could.. life is not perfect.. men are not perfect.. I do know that now.. so, that guy, (in a Sex-and-the-City-like fashion, let's just call him Mr Right) I had to leave him after one year because I was moving.. and I finally accepted the feelings I had for him.. but I didn't tell him.. so with the distance growing, my feelings also grew.. in an exponential way.. so, here I was, yearning for a guy who lives far away, and I didn't even dare tell him.. it would've been irrealistic to believe he would leave everything and follow me, wouldn't it?   so, now it's one year later (almost), and we had some trouble chatting regularly.. and of course, the less we talked, the more my feelings grew and the more I idealized him in my perfect little dream world.. today, we finally chatted for a while.. and, you guess it, he's seeing someone.. and not only that (no, that wouldn't be enough considering the bad luck that seems to be following me when it comes to relationships), he's even interested in yet another woman.. yeah.. life is what happens when you're busy making other plans..  now, good news first: if he's interested in another woman, that person he's seeing right now can't be mrs right. if she was the one for him, he wouldn't waste time looking into other options, wouldn't he?  secondly, the other girl he's interested in doesn't seem to reciprocate.. he said, he'll know by Friday but things are looking bad.. so, being the optimist to the end, maybe we're not supposed to be together now.. maybe I'm supposed to finish all my exams (I'm at the end of my studies right now), get my life in order, and then go for Mr Right?  Oh yeah, and you want to know the best part? When he told me about this girl he's interested in, I even told him to go for it and to find out about her feelings! Doesn't that deserve a medal? I guess, I just want him to be happy.. and if it's not with me, then, well.. I don't wanna continue that thought.. I'm just hoping things will work out and that there's some bigger destiny waiting for me.. for us..  So much for my day.. the rest was pretty boring.. received some materials for class I'm suppposed to read till next Tuesday. 400 pages! That's ridiculous.. but I don't care about any of my jobs or school right now.. Friday's gonna be a good day for me.. I know it.. sorry, Mr Right, I want you to be happy but.. well.. I don't know the girl, but I bet she's wrong for you...   Anyway.. as if this wasn't enough about destiny today, there's an old episode of "Charmed" on TV in which Cole (the cutest guy on the show.. but psst.. don't tell Mr Right ;-)) goes almost insane because he's so much in love with Phoebe.. now isn't that coincidental?  Alright.. enough of this soul-relieving blogging.. I gotta start getting my life back together.. at least, the Red Sox beat the A's 12:2 last night.. though that reminds me of Mr Right again.. he's one of those devoted fans..   Ah crap.. I hope you crazy lovers out there won't commit the same mistakes ..  Peace out!
