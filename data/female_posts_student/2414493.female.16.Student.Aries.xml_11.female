One of those practices where nobody's really awake--even J wasn't in her usual perverted mindset this morning). Hilarious to the nth degree. I talked to the bug for the first time online last night and it was just one of those conversations that actually go beyond "what's up?" I can only count a few people like that...E, S and now C, occasionally N. I love him, he's so funny and always so full of energy, so upbeat. He was on the stand today and for some reason I just couldn't stop laughing at his answers because they sounded so normal him instead of scripted River Lenox and it was almost like sarcasm. Besides that, it has become apparent that there's some serious planning in the get D to winter ball scheme. Frankly, I don't know what's going to happen since it deals with guys with no balls (or vaginas, as C calls them) and a girl who is probably too out of it to think anything of coaches falling out of chairs, of secret conferences between people who inexplicably mean more to her than any regular person would. So let's just say that I jump every time the phone rings. And there it goes--line two. lol  Car ride to Malibu Lagoon with C. Adopt a Beach. There's something about PCH that makes me feel so damn good. Every time I find myself looking out the windows at that little two-lane highway with the beach houses and that curve where the sea meets the sand, I remember something happy about it. The first day, clouds and hope. Then the Vermonster and giggling to no end. Trips to Santa Monica, Jimmy Eat World...and now this. Lunch today at Neptune's Net. Sitting next to a group of bikers, probably not too much of a threat since they had "Soldiers for Jesus" embroidered on the backs of their leather jackets. Drive up Decker, things not to be mentioned...  And now, waiting for a phone call.  Life is beautiful.
