We had a great meeting - everything is coming together nicely.  After I went home as Lucy and Darren both said they wanted to hang out but neither one called so I just continue where I left off on my packing once I got home.  I must have lsitened to Sade's cd "Lovers Rock" about 3 times when I decided to give my old buddy Clint a call.  He used to work with me at ECI but was unfortunately fired back in April. We were very close friends and since I haven't heard from him in a long time I decided to give him a buzz and tell him about my new job and turning in resignation notice.  We ended up being on the phone for about 30 minutes and he invited me over to have a few beers with him.  So, I went over to his place around 9 and he was playing some retarded online shoot-em up game on his computer. We hung out, caught up and it was a lot of fun.  I left his place around 11 and headed home.   I talked to AJ on my way home and he wanted to hang out, so we did.  I love him soooo much. I am going to miss him more than he can imagine. It's hard to believe that we have only been friends for about 4 years - it seems like I have known him my entire life. We were joking last night that our international phone calls are going to be outrageous.  I told him that he HAS to come to San Diego to visit me when I am in port. My baby!!  Anyway, here I am this morning at ECI, not working as usual. It's boring here. I am over it. I am ready to go. My boss, Jeff, just left a little bit ago for another all day meeting at our corporate office. That's a good thing. Blah blah blah.  I miss my Jennifer. I didn't get to see her last night because she had plans with Heidi and Kim.  I hope I can see her tonight.  I just want to go to her house and curl up beside her on the sofa and watch tv. Or jump into her big huge king size bed and sleeeeep. Yummy!
