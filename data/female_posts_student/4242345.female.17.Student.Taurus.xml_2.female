Anyone who has ANYTHING remotely interesting to do leave now.  I guess if your still reading then you are as bored as I am.....  I don't know what to say really, I'm feeling alone and bored and missing George like crazy. I mean, why is it that I still want to be with someone who repeatedly lied to me and cheated on me with a 15-year-old? I'm I that sad or desperate that I believe that's all I'm worth? or is George 'the one' who I'm destined to live out my days with? Although id love this to be the case, sadly I think its highly unlikely.  Surely I'm young and meant to want to go out and have fun, not want a 'serious' relationship. Surely I'm going to spend my whole life regretting not being less uptight and boring in my youth. I mean these are meant to be the best years of my life and all I seem to be doing is thinking about the future, or moping about the past. Maybe I don't want to be a teenager at all, maybe I want to be some middle-aged woman with all the security that comes with having lived out more than half your life. Or maybe I should just get a grip and start being what I am rather than dreaming about things that are not going to happen in years - if at all.  So, how exactly do you 'act like a teenager'? I've spent the best part of my life trying to be 'grown up' and am always "The responsible one" who my mother looks to for advice. Maybe being 'responsible' is my vocation, and I am destined to spend my whole life worrying about other people and advising my mother on another problem that life has thrown at her.  I mean what is it to 'act like a teenager' anyway? Should start being 'wild', moody, taking drugs and going out to squat parties every weekend and taking the week to recover from it all? Should I wear nike trainers, my hair scramped back and wear a permanent scowl whilst shouting abuse at random people on the street? Should I dye my hair black and conform to a strict dress code of black and dayglow in am attempt to be non-conformist? I don't know, but if that's what it is to be a teenager, I think I'l give it a miss.  I'm quite happy with radio 4 waking me up every morning, knitting with my granny and knowing that I don't care if I wear designer clothes or whatever. I may not go out all the time and socialize with sad druggy weirdos, but at least when I do go to parties a have a really good time hanging out with my good friends who are lovely and fun to hang out with. anyway enough pointless rambling, night night all xx
