I just got a phone call from ARKANSAS!!  LoL.   *** I'm feeling kinda down.  I checked Ticketmaster and the only tickets available to Josh's concert is the lawn.  The LAWN!!!  I don't know if I should buy them now, or wait till the concert date and see if I can get   better   seats... *sigh*  I had a wacky dream last night.  Usually I don't get crazy dreams... that's Alisa's and Catherine's thing.  (inside joke).  But Josh was in it! He was in my living room, and he gave me a nice hug and two tickets to his concert!!!  LoL.  It was sooo real!  I know I'm sounding dilusional... aaaggh!! *** 1)Saw two of Mr. Groban's photos in the Willamette Week. 2)Message from Arkansas! 3)100% on my Anatomy Exam!  Carpe Diem!!
