They look so beautiful, like little pink sugar puffs waiting to be eaten.  Why the evenings are more beautiful than the days at the moment.  Why life is full of confusion.  Why I find myself always being happy, I never no why.  Why I find myself writing on here day after day.  Why I have found some of the BEST FRIENDS a girl could ask for.  Why I am so weird.  Why I have the urge to go for an evening run.  Why the place around me is so peaceful and calm.  ......hmmmmm........  They name just a few of the thoughts in my very tiny brain at this precise moment in time, I could name some more, but there is such a thing known as  CONFIDENTIALITY!!   Yes well now that I have confused and bored you all to death.....I am going to continue some more, read on if you want know what it feels like to to be dying of bordem...........  I need a project, I need a project to stop my mind from turning into more of a custard than it already is! I suppose you could say these are my projects:-  reading and writing, confusing and boring,  running and cycling,  listening and talking,  shopping and ....well shopping!!!  Those are my projects....well not projects but definatly how I am spending my time......well I forgot to mention working....but who the hell wants to be reminded of that!!   Yes well......I am now off to read...I know read - an actual book, not magazine, but book, yes believe it or not  I love to read!!!   Love Nat xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
