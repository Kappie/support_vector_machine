There is so much that I want to discuss yet haven't.  Lets see...    I think here would be an interesting topic to atart with.  I have many questions that I will later address that I would love comments on.  Scenerio  My husband works out at a salvage yard and this woman came there many months ago to get a part for her car and to get it fixed.  She's immediately attracted to my husband.  This woman has a high paying office job and a beautiful house of her own, and no husband.  Proposition from the woman  Even though I know that you are married  I am wanting you to move in with me.  You won't have to pay for anything and I will buy you anything that you desire.   My question is..   Why do other women try to disturb a happy marriage?  My Information  I have been married to my husband for a little over a year.  We were together for a year before we got married.  We are extremely happy as we have always been.  I am not working and not contributing financially in the household.  My husband has to work hard for all the stuff that we have and even harder for the house that we are in the process of buying.  I am going to college full time to please myself and to make our futures easier, but it will be years before I am finished.  Then I guess that is the grounds for why she would mention her job and her house to try to make his life easier? Or What?  Or is she so desperate that she can't find a good single man?  More information...  I do not know this woman who I am refering to.  I don't even know her name.  That was meant to be that way.  If I knew her name I am the type of person that would confront her without a doubt even though nothing odviously came about from the incident.  Why would I do that?  I am not sure either.  I have always trusted my husband and do without a doubt, but I do not trust other women.  What makes me paranoid about other women saying those things when they know the man is happy and married?  I have put some thought into it.  (My previous relationship was bad.)  I am Not trying to gain anyones sympathy, I consider it a learning process, or a lesson learned.   I just thought it would be interesting to talk about.  Comments Welcome.
