I can't believe this... I loved that story, and I only had it for the while I was writing. Shall try to recreate...  Update: (5 minutes later) All is not lost. I still have the concepts I created to hold on to and cherish. What I felt for that story was more than enjoyment or self-congratulation. It took so much and so little. I spent maybe half an hour writing it, but I poured my soul into it, giving birth, in effect. I  loved  it. And it's still with me. I was sick at heart, but my soul-child survives. Maybe I  can re-create what I lost, but not tonight.  My mother will never see a reason for me to stay on the computer. She is solid, and I am fluid.
