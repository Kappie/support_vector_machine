Read "Teen love series", on relationship. Quite interesting I gotta say. After reading it, I got a lot happier, maybe perhaps I realized that things in the book is true, and it helped me realize some things. I gotta learn howta love myself in order to be loved. Keke! I'm happy today, even though I didn't go out. But I'm gonig to the gym tomorrow to work out, and going to TO!!! Whoo hoo! Getta finally see Ga!!! AFter two months, finally!!!
