I woke up and went to Panera Bread Company, n got me a Cinnamon Crunch Bagel w/ Hazelnut Cream Cheese...it was SOO Good!...Then we had to get back to the house so my sister could pack for girlscout camp.  When we got home I went to sleep and it was a nice nap.  Bout an Hour later i woke up n had to go w/ my mom to drop off my sister @ Camp Keyauwee.  After Traveling on highways, and the going through the middle of nowhere for about 2 hours, we finnally reached our destination.  Oh yea i forgot to say we got the house we wanted.  Anyways we arrived @ Keyauwee and stood in teh blistering hot sun for a good 30 mins.  It Sucked.  Then we finally got her to her bunk or w/e u call it and left.  Oh yea, when we were there these two like hott twin guys were there...they looked about 15 or 16...idk but they were cute.  Well Thats About It...Finnally...A Week Without my sibling!
