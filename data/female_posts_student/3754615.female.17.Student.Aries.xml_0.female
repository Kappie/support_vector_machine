I'm going camping this Thursday too, so I'm gonna have to come back on Friday cuz summer school starts then.. How retarded is that!? You know what else is retarded? School, more then half the stuff we learn is never gone do us any good... So why take the effort in strangling to pay attention in class so we can know what to do for the agonizing hours of homework? To me.. It just makes no sence at all. O well, im almost done, next year is gr 12.. But im kinda scared.. I kinda know what I wanna do.. But I just don't know how to get there. Like colledge is fore sure I think... It would be so much easier if I could jus be a rock star lol... Oh that would be the life!  Yeah Kelsey and I are gonna start a band with some guys and were gonna be so awesome, and oh don't u worry, backstage passes will be promised to those who are loved lol... I rely do think its possible. You watch lol
