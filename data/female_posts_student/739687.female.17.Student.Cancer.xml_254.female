Then I came home, got a shower, and just layed around my room all day. Today felt nice. I opened my windows and sorta soaked it all in. The weather made me optimistic of good things. Good things that...that I just wish would happen.  Well, I'm so tired. I'm outta here.  Make good things happen, crazies.
