'cause i'm free to be me.. nobody tells me who to be..-           I am absolutely sick of guys and their temperments.... driving me nuts. I quit.      I'm sick of guys flirting with me... stop already!!           I'm beyond screwed up... I want school to start... -badly- people who don't know me.. don't have judgements on me... won't try and force me into one thing and then another...           Won't make me feel guilty for wanting one thing instead of another..           Aaron called today.. so he got home safe which is good... though his sick.. which sucks lol... couldn't handle the canadian weather, eh? -ducks and hides-          I also go to talk to Kevin and Allie.. which as always was hilarious.... Allie is absolutely fed up with being pregnant... and so takes it out on Kevin as its supposedly his fault lol..... and Kevin is his normally million and one things at once self... hehe Allie's coming with me to get clothes for school so woohoo...            I'm still registered at Medicine Hat... stupid school....
