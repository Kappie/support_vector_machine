"Today, Declare Yourself, a non-partisan voter-registration group started by the television producer Norman Lear, will raise two giant billboards in Times Square, showing Christina Aguilera and Andre 3000 with their mouths held shut, next to the message, 'Only you can silence yourself.'"    In this year's election, nonpartisan groups such as Cast the Vote, the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network, Redeem the Vote, Voter Virgin, Voteloud, Voces del Pueblo, Punk Voter, Rock the Vote and Choose or Lose, hope to increase voter turnout. They employ broad marketing tactics targeting young voters, from "sending interactive text messages to cell phones" to "producing performances by everyone from the Rza of W-Tang Clan fame to the Rock 'N' Roll Worship Circus." A cause for such persistent encouragement to vote may be derived from the 2000 election's close outcome. Another theory is that an increasing number of young adults are finding an increasing interest in politics. Whatever the cause, the advertisements seem to be working. In a study of the Iowa assembly from the Harvard University Institute of Politics, 17% of people under the age of 30 are participant voters, up from only 9% in 2000.    Hopefully, these ads do influence more young voters to vote. In a time of political tesion, every vote should count, because the victor will lead our country. As photographer David LaChapelle said, "It's going to be scary if you don't use your voice."
