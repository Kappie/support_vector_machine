Im still having fun in London, i love it here.   uhm.   ive seen a bunch of plays, i guess.. i saw Les Miserables, The complete works of William Shakespear (which was like, a takeoff thing of shakespeare) and chicago. i went and did all the touristy stuff, which was cool. My aunt took a tour of the tower of london which was boring so i wandered off and talked to some french kids even though i suck at french. we went on the london eye, which is the tallest ferris wheel in the world, and it was REALLY tall. and we went to the london dungeons which sucked ass. ALL OF YOU- NEVER GO TO THE LONDON DUNGEONS UNLESS YOU ARE UNDER 12 YEARS OLD. IT IS BORING AND TOURISTY AND CHEESY AS HELL.  whew. anyway. and uh. i tried to make the guys with the fuzzy hats laugh, but then after about 2 minutes i got bored of that because they never laugh and i just felt stupid trying.   oh yeah! and i went to the Westminster abbey this morning for CHURCH at 8 AM! because my aunt wanted me to experience a service in a major church, i guess. Ugh. it was boring and early and they kept giving me horrible looks and my uncle kept being all 'is this what you normally wear when you try to show your respect for another country's beliefs?' and i was like 'wtf, i didnt plan on bringing clothes to go to church in...'  so.  uh. i went and hung out on camden (again) with the same people (again.)i met this really funny german kid named alex who didnt speak a whole lot of english but thats ok, he was hilarious anyway. he was trying to tell me about his piercings, hes the only other person ive ever seen with the bridge of his nose pierced (like liz) and we just sat around, again. OH, and then i had to go home and he was trying to help me get around the underground, but i got lost as hell anyway and then he had to go meet his girlfriend i guess. anyway, even thought it probably doesnt sound like it, it was fun.  oh! last night i went to a street fair, because it was really close to my house. it was in the street a couple of blocks away from my flat, and my window opens really easily so i just went. It was a bunch of drunken british people wandering around, and there was some band playing and some drunken girl gave me some champagne.   i still have  my mushrooms, i got a LOT...i dont even know how much it weighs, im gonna weigh it when i get back to colorado. a lot of mushrooms, though. like 20-30 stems? anyway. somebody is eating pasta and i really want some, cause it smells really good. i figured out how to put pictures that i took on the internet, but i am horrendously stupid and i forgot to bring my camera to the internet cafe thing.  i had to ship my bullet belt home today, im going to be so pissed if it doesnt come through customs... i payed more to ship it than i did to BUY it. stupid british postage costing a gazillion dollars.   anyway. i come home on saturday, thats in 2 days... i think my plane gets in around 6:30 pm. BUT I DONT HAVE TO BABYSIT THE NEXT DAY, THANK FUCKING GOD. i swear, by the end of the summer, im going to murder those fucking children. ::stab::. so much anger.   im hungry, im going to go home i think...  i miss you all SO much.  ~abby
