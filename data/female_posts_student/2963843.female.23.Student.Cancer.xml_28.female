Sometimes, I will switch to that station on my handphone and stop there   Am I getting old? I really hope not...  Jazz... my new love... Bless.. =)    I wish you love [Lisa Ono]   I wish you bluebirds in the Spring  To give your heart a song to sing  And then a kiss, but more than this,  I wish you love   And in July a lemonade  To cool you in some leafy glade  I wish you health, and more than wealth,  I wish you love   My breaking heart and I agree  That you and I could never ever be  So with my best, my very best,  I set you free   I wish you shelter from the storm  A cozy fire to keep you warm  But most of all  When snowflakes fall, I wish you love   My breaking heart and I agree  That you and I could never ever be  So with my best, my very best,  I set you free   I wish you shelter from the storm  A cozy fire to keep you warm  But most of all  When snowflakes fall, I wish you love   When snowflakes fall, I wish you love  When snowflakes fall, I wish you love  When snowflakes fall, I wish you love...
