I suppose not up until these last moments of desperately trying to get it to work that i've realized that i'm completely obsessed with email...i check it three, four, five times a day. Or more. Its thrilling in a way, some kind of strange hope that someone will for a minute sit down and think...hey...i should write to jessica because well i can...it excites me immensly. Horrible horrible addiction.   I've decided on the most true statement of all time just now.   What goes around comes around, everything goes in circles   I swear to god everytime i think "oh yeah this is going to come back and bite me in the ass" and sure enough...it always does. If i hurt someone, weeks, months later the same thing happens to me. grr. Now i'm going to go listen to the old Incubus CD and reminise about when things really sucked, because thats when i listened to this cd.  I need a good moshing concert to cheer me up. A fight circle... thats what i need. RAr.
