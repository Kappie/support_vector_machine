My fyp is getting stuck.... my client doesn't place/know the importance of pr and now me and my grp mate are taking the shit -- they dun know what we can do, so, they have conveniently created the illusion that there's nothing much we can do and therefore they can throw whatever shit work they want to us.  It's their downfall... but i am not letting this rest. I will talk them round it and i will get my way - yes,  my way  how this pr programme is to be run. They dun know then they should just sit one side and look and talk when necessary. I am not about to let a bunch of fools ruin my fyp, my career and yet have to take this insult eyes wide open.  Life is hard mann... but i know i am lucky despite all these cos it can get worse and i am counting my blessings now. I'm a survivor and i know i will do well no matter what circumstances.  Right now, all i'm thinking is that i have to finish my readings before the lecture tmr... i wanna be on top of things. And after school, i'm going to buy the other pr textbk and read them before class on tues.  Final year... wanna do my best... i'll never be a student again!
