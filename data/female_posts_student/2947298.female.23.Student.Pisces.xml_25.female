Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.  Joel: I remember that speech really well.  Clementine: I had you pegged, didn't I?  Joel: You had the whole human race pegged.  Clementine: Probably.  Joel: I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   So I've been busy working on the  urlLink VVA  website.  I helped design it and help update it.  As of recent I am the only one who updates it but I do so under Ross's name.  I think it's appreciated, not quite sure.  Sometimes I look back and think how stupid I was to do a certain thing, like why couldn't I see the implications then.  To be used or to just be blind about ANYTHING.  You learn from mistakes, but it seems I keep making the same ones over and over again.  Give people to many chances, or trust.  But that's what you are supposed to do, trust, give, it's some sort of fucked up paradox I exist in. I feel like those cartoon characters or like Neo in the Matrix.  You run one way and some how it brings you full circle to the start, it's not like you circles, you just ran foward and poof the start again.  I as of recent dropped off from reality.  I was so sure of everything and now I am not.  I mean I'm sure but now what?  I'm stuck here, can't move.  In a bad game of chess, I ran out of good moves, the only ones I can see will check me.  I was minus 3 today, that was good.  It's odd how we thinking in more and less, plus and minus all the time.  You need more, need less.  Loose weight, gain wealth.  One giant scale we endlessly try to even out.  Good, bad.  Someone so rich had to loose something to gain that money.  Someone so poor had to gain something by loosing all that wealth.  But that doesn't quite work.  You can never have it all but you sure as hell can loose it, how can life go so off balance?  Eh, BladeRunner's got me all thinking. All we are, Memories. Emotions set us apart from machines, and the memories set us apart from most.  We are only memories, and most die with us. My fish forget's about every minute where it was and swims back around it's tiny bowl it loves so much.  It doesn't like other fish, but they can't remember long enough to know they are lonley.  Is that a blessing or a curse?  A generation of people who are taught to hate themselves.
