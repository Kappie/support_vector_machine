I'm going to Ashley's later. I'm kind of nervous, because I have to meet her family. Eek. --I'm downloading videos off Warez of Mad TV. I love that show. Have you ever been watching t.v. alone, and laughed, and then got wierded out by it. Grr,  I hate when I do that. But, then it makes me think..about why I feel comfort laughing when other people are around, and why not when Im alone. Are the laughs around other people fake..or, who knows. Anyhow, I think that William is going to come over today and we are going to have Chinese. woo hoo..I love chinese chicken. It tastes SOOO good! Hopefully my dad will get it for me. If not...*pout lip* I'm going to be sad. I woke the iguanas up, I think that I woke them up too early though. Not long ago, when I looked at my clock it was 8:40..and now it's 9:39...It seems like only 10 minutes ago I look at my clock and had it say that..Time is flying, and Im bored. Yippee! The videos are almost done. I supposed I should go watch those now. hehe...If I have time I'll probably write later..if not, I'll write tomorrow. :) Have I skipped a day yet? hmm...I dont think I have. I love this Blog. hehe..I really do.     Im in a good mood...for an AKWARD reason, I am happy. Maybe because William woke me up? :)
