Maybe it's just the lack of sleep and the new pill (BTW, my boobs have gotten HUGE. I can't understand it, and it's kinda uncomfortable. Though I admit, it's a little bit okay.), but I am feeling weepy about everything in my history classes.  It's "crunch time," in the parlance of our times (as the Dude would say): tonight and probably tomorrow I write a paper for western American history, I believe 5-7 pages. Next I'm going to get a rough draft done for seminar, then I'm going to meet with the prof. to discuss my outline, etc. And either tomorrow or Thursday I have to go to the exit loan counseling, which I meant to do with Liz, but I'm way too busy today (how did it go, Liz?). Thursday I need to study for western American history final, and write up a reading journal, which won't be too bad, because the books are what I'm writing an essay about tonight. Sunday is the final due date of the seminar paper (10-12 pages, expanding on an existing essay, which I got an A on. Yay!), which I'll email in. Then I have my American political history final on Wednesday, Spanish America final on Thursday, and COMMENCEMENT on Saturday. Wow. How did it get so close to the end? Weird. Next step: the real world and a JOB.
