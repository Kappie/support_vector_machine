Highlights: Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion: "He could barely contain his erection every time she was around. Why do you think he always carried that huge notebook?" "This dress exacerbates the genetic betrayel that is my legacy" "-Has anybody told you that smoking can kill you?  -No, no one. Thank you!" "Let's fold scarves" "-Swear to God, sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.  -Do you want to try, to see if we are?  -What? Yeah, right, Michelle. Just the idea of having sex with another woman creeps me out. But if we're still single at 30, ask me again.  -Okay." "I hope your babies look like monkeys!" "Ramone quit jerking off and bring the car around!" "Come. Let me make it up to you. I have boxes of Kleenex in my limo." "-I'm so glad you didn't bring your big notebook. -Michelle!" "Would you excuse me? I cut my foot before and my shoe is filling up with blood. *limps away*"  there are more but now onto... Young Frankenstein: "Sedagive?!?!" "That's Fronk-en-steen" "Nice hopping" "Vould you like to roll in ze hay? Roll roll roll in ze hay" "-What knockers -Thank you doctor" "-He's going to have an enormous schvanstuker  -That goes without saying.  -OOF!  -He's going to be very popular" "We must accept this as all things, with quiet dignity and grace. YOU SON OF A BITCH BASTARD! I'LL KILL YOU! I DO NOT WANT TO LIVE! I DO NOT WANT TO LIVE!! " "Wait! Where are you going? I was gonna make espreso." "destiny, destiny, no escaping thats for me!" "-Werewolf!  - Werewolf?  - There wolf, there castle! -Why are you talking that way? -I thought you wanted to. -I don't want to. -Suit yourself, I'm easy." "-Elevate me.  -Right here?" "- It's moments like these, I remember what my old dad used to say to me.  - Oh yes? What did he say?  - What are DOING spending all your time in the BATHROOM for!! Why don't you give someone else a go!"  incredible.
