So far I've had 4 visitors via Yahoo, who must have been sorely disappointed to end up here with the following search terms:  * Timothy Omundson * John Stalker adverts * birthday kiss * "Kevin Rahm" pictures  I must admit I am quite sad that there is so little stuff about Tim Omundson on the Internet that someone doing a web search for his name would end up here with my one crappy little photo of him (which was stolen from someone else's website anyway); he has recently joined the likes of  Robert Duncan McNeill  and  Colin Firth  as Men I Would Like To See More Of (on whatever level you want to interpret that) and I'm frankly amazed more people don't seem to think the same. Anyway, for the benefit of anyone else who strays here looking for him, there is a pretty good website about him (which doesn't always show up on search engines for some reason)  here .  (Actually, what I said a minute ago wasn't strictly true; there was also one Yahoo search last night for "Rachel Padden" - my maiden name - but I know that was my mum. To be fair, she did warn me she was going to try and find my website but for some reason I wasn't smart enough to remove all the swear words and other *controversial* stuff before she saw it. Oops.)
