They are such a relief. ...I don't understand how some people can always wear glasses.. Bah!..  Aaron has a  LiveJournal ... which is not helping my addiction of reading other peoples blogs/LJs/diarys/whatever... (...I hope he doesn't mind me posting the link..) Oh, and he mentioned me in his LJ...twice! ...Hehe, I always feel so special when people mention me! :) hehe  I need valium... No, not for me. It's for the girl that is helping me do sound for  Wings , Angie. She likes a 5-year-old on speed.. only more energetic.... She does not stand still! She is always trying too hard to do stuff; she is really persistent. She stands, literally, an inch away from me. She thinks she's hilarious, but she's not even remotely funny--not in the slightest way! And she is always talking to me and asking questions, especially at times when I have to concentrate on what is going on onstage and/or the volumes of the actors/mics/music/sound effects... Bah.... I was trying so hard not to yell at her today.. ...I hate yelling at people.. I hate even being assertive... :\  ...Honestly... I don't know how much longer I can deal with this chick...  Bah...  I'm whiny...
