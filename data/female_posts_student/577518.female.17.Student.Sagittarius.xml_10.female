Try to finish all the homework by this week, decided to study next week.   Durian season is here, aunt bought 10kg of durians and the smell is everywhere. I spray the perfume everywhere in my room and it's still like those durians are in my room.   Want to blog more, but my brain is blank...   By the way, happy birthday to Yang di-Pertuan Agong! :)
