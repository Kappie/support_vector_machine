Amanda, the bike fell!”  My Mother lies on the driveway, mercilessly pinned under my inhumanly pink bike.  I crumple to the ground, the grass staining my clothes as I howl in deranged laughter.  A failed attempt at riding a bike  will be nothing more than bruised pride tomorrow.  Telling my sister every detail  will make my ruined jeans worth it.
