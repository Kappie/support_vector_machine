My dad will not get off my freaking back. This is going to suck until Tuesday when my mom gets back. How did it happen that since I have grown up, my dad has gotten so anal about everything and my mom has gotten so laid back when they were completely opposite of that when i was younger. Like right now, my dad has got something shoved up his ass about me having company. WTF? I mean, I'm an only child and I'm bored out of my mind being by myself 16 hours out of every day. Like tomorrow, I will babysit for Alice's kids from 3-6 after practice. GOD. MY DAD IS SUCH AN ASS! He's telling me how lazy I am and all this crap you probably couldnt understand unless you were me right now. He's just a pain..oh well, i find a way to deal with it until my mom gets back. I did have fun tonight though. It was really funny actually, like we played hide and seek, sardines, and we played in the rain and played my playstation with all the weird random games mike bought for me..it was cool. well i have to go clean up the house before my dad has an aneurism, jeezis...haha. its actually kind of funny how retarded he is about things being clean, you just cant help but laugh. oooo. i found Kevin's sock, i need to give it back to him tomrrow. i'll put it right here by the door.
