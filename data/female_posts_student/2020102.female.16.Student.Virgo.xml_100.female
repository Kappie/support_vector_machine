The friends quotes are under "All my weirdness," which has been the name of the file I have saved everything my strange friends have said since 7th grade under, and the non-candid quote goodness will be under the title "Non-Candid Quote Goodness." Read and be happy.    Non-Candid Quote Goodness:  "Just because I’m happy doesn't mean you couldn't make me happier.” –Ashleigh Brilliant  "Have you ever heard the wonderful silence just before the dawn? Or the quiet and calm just as a storm ends? Or perhaps you know the silence when you haven't the answer to a question you've been asked, or the hush of a country road at night, or the expectant pause in a roomful of people when someone is just about to speak, or, most beautiful of all, the moment after the door closes and you're all alone in the whole house? Each one is different, you know, and all very beautiful, if you listen carefully." –Norton Juster, The Phantom Tollbooth  "a hundred times i tried to hear you singing/ a dozen times i tried to hold your hand/ once i think i even tried to kiss you/ but there's only so much i can do inside my head" –WJKT, unfinished song  "The world is a scary place.
