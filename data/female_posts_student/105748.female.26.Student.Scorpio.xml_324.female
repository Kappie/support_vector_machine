Locate the spot that you want to put your links/graphics and type away. The appropriate syntax is listed below.       FOR LINKS   A HREF="http://enter.url.here"Link Title/A     FOR IMAGES   IMG SRC="http://image.url.here"     FOR IMAGE LINKS   A HREF="http://enter.url.here"IMG SRC="http://image.url.here"/A      Try these and let me know if they work for you. If you have any problems, do not hesitate to holler.    By the way, I remember Rupert and I also remember "Anxiety Closet." I still think it's my favorite one. I suspect a lot of people feel the same way.
