I was enjoying myself so much that DayangCONG said that i'm making use of this opportunity to take my revenge. Hahaz. But i really got lots of energy to waste...too bad they didn't give me a chance to do so.*sigh* I didn't get to see HER much today...feeling kinda lost liaoz...Chamz ar...in this case...that means that i wun't be able 2 survive without her.
