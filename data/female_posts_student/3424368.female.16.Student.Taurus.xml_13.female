My report card was... uhmm... It was my report card.  Yup.  I passed everything,.. haha, lucky me! =P... Luanne wasn't there tho, so I was sad =(  I'm gonna miss her sooooo much when she's gone this summer.  *sigh*  Things are alright tho,... I mean, right now, I really dont have much to say,... I have a lot on my mind right now, and I'm feeling a lot of different things, but I don't know.. things just seem to be weird, I guess.  Hmm... OH, on friday I'm gonna go with Marci  Gerardo to go watch Shrek 2... hehe... I love that movie sooo much!  I could see it over and over and over again.  It's gonna be a lot of fun, because I've never been out with Marci before,... so yay =)  Yup yup... that's about all I have to say for now...
