I stayed inside most of the day, since I'm terribly sunburnt on my back and chest and arms. It hurts like the dickens. Ah well. It's 10:20 at the moment, just for the record. I also talked to Chelsea and Nick today. It was very fun. Oooh, and I got to watch Aladdin. hehehe. It's such a good movie...*ish a nerd* well, goodnight everyone.  Love, Shannon
