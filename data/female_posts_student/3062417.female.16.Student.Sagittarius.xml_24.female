The only things that ever happen are bad things. My life sucks.  Well right now I'm listening to Allister and talking to Carol and Gavin. Later I have a doctor's appt so I might not be on again today.   Song:  If I could tell you one thing Then I'd tell you everything I'd probably say that you've been on my mind Since we held hands out in the rain Smoking cigarettes to play Off all the butterflies I had inside  And now I think that you should know That you've got everything That I've wanted for so damn long And that I wouldn't hesitate to trade away everything If you tell me that I'm not wrong So know I think that you should know That I've been waiting for you  Since we sat underneath the stars as I held you in my arms Killing just another summer night  It's funny how the best things happen sometimes And how I'll always remember those endless nights But don't forget I regret the fact that I have to leave you Right as the best part starts So I thought I'd take the time to say  -Waiting For You- Allister
