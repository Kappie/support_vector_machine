F-ck you. get those thoughts out of your head asshole. she hasen't asked yet and neither have I. I doubt that both our moms will say yes. But who cares? it's the thought that counts. even if i dont get 2 go, i c her a lot during the day. i walk her home after school, etc. etc. etc. peace out. when i get my website up, ill tell u about it. K? -john
