Nothing new has really gone on here. My parents found a house a few months ago that they liked, and now the ppl in the house have lowered the price by $5000, so now my mom wants it but my dad isn't sure...whatever!   I am so excited that I'm gonna be a SENIOR this year!! One more year and I'm off to college! YAY!  I went out to Red Cedar on Thursday and got to see a bunch of ppl. I didn't wanna leave, but I had to go to the Vet...I wanted to ride soo badly too! I haven't been on a horse since Feb. I'm soo deprived! :) Oh well, I guess I'll be able to when the time is right?   Okay, I'm goin to get some food b/c I'm HUNGRY!
