It's not like I'm fat, I could just stand to lose some weight.  It's funny, but I still have the same hang-ups about weight that I had when I was dancing.  I still feel guilty when I eat something fattening, even though I haven't really danced in years.  It's odd, anyway.  But I'd like to get my weight back down a little.  Perhaps once I get back up to school it will be easier.    I also haven't done a lick of research.  I need to come up with a topic to write about in a paper for next semester, and so far I've done no work on it.  Oh well.  Perhaps I will find a sudden burst of committedness.  Meanwhile, I think I've got more Minesweeper to play and more Harry Potter to read...  Busy showing the world that when I've got nothing to do, I am really quite lazy...
