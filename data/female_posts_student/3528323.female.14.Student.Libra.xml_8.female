I was there all alone with the 8th grade girls and man are those girls good!! I suck compared to them and I am so0o0o out of shape it was not good at all!! Oh well!!  Well my mom had to go to a surpise 50th birthday for her friend tonite so she asked if I could be Nurse again to my bro! I didnt care cuz earlier it was easy! Well he was laying on the couch when I got home (like he had been all day...well my mom left and so like a good 10 minutes after she left he went to the bathroom...he was coming back and he said he felt dizzy!! He did not look good at all so I took him to the couch!! I was so0o0o scared!! I thought he was going to pass out...I ran over to the phone and called my mom....my mom was so0o calm and was like okay just get him some ice water and some ice chips to suck on!! I was like how can you be calm!! then he was like It's really hot so I turned on the fan really high and I hung up the phone and I came back into the family room and he was like I'm fine!! I was like okay are you sure?? And he was like yeah!! So he took a blanket and fell asleep....  My day has been CRAZY!! And I finished up Chloe's present and Kevin's graduation present....I cant wait to give it to them!! Ãœ
