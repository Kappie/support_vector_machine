UM: I don't know if you guys want to get ready at my house or what, I have tons of bathrooms and counter space and beautifying materials, so whatever.  So anytime between 5-7 are good times although if the prom starts at 7:30, i would assume showing up before 7 would be better since we'll need like pictures or whatever.  I assume you'll need to be at my place anyways cause that's where all the rides are coming from so, yeah.  I DON"T know what we are doing after Prom but there's been mention of an egg fight.  So no matter what we do, bring a change of clothes.  ANOTHER question, how long did you guys want to stay at prom?  I dont' really care but 4 and 1/2 hours is hella, so, whatever, just wanted to bring that up  AND LASTLY, don't forget your protection, cause I'm only bringing what I need, not enough for a group orgy. hehe.  I'm gonna have  lots  or fun!
