Mrs. Kuiper has recently seen a doctor and the results are negative...she has a maximum of a week to live...my heart goes out to danielle and the family, i am so sorry....I will try to visit her soon, I feel so bad that a friend of mine has to go through the pain of losing someone so close...it is unfair that someone so good, has to go through such pain and anguish...Mrs. Kuiper is a good, loving caring, sweet person, and it pains me to think of her lying in that bed, helplessly, unable to see her family, and the sickness must be killer in its own right, throwing up extensively, and needing help with that aswell...I will pray for her, In my own way of course, Im not christian, but I will pray...       On a brighter note....I asked Jasper if i did ask him out what would he say, and he said he didn't know what he'd say, but its a lot better then I like you....as a friend. So ya, that makes me happy, but i have feeling for a few other guys too, and i wanna get those outa the way before I date any 1, but Im working on getting a boyfriend, so people can back off, oh and just for emily, im not letting you email Jasper, I have his email and I will keep it to myself...so there :P  School is almost over, 2 days of classes and 2 days of exams, then im done, the its to tanning and to swimming and camping, and chillin with friends, with work on my plays and book of course...  Well I think Im gonna go, I have to paint my nails and do my make up before I go to my dads, but its gonna take me forever to do my nails...  ttyl later, or i'll see you this weekend...  Love you all                Lil' Nicki
