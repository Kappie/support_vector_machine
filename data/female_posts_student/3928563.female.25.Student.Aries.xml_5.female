Or is it a virus that could manifest itself in other places (eg. saliva)? Could one contract the disease by sharing drinks with an infected person? What about sharing a bathroom regularly?   ----------------  The short answer: there are two kinds of herpes, oral (causes cold sores) and genital. Yes, the two viruses are similar and can transfer between the two sites. Many people, for example, get 'oral' herpes on their genitals after getting head from someone with a cold sore. On the brighter side, it's hard to get genital herpes on your mouth, so your friend likely isn't going to transfer his herpes to his mouth and then infect you that way.   In case your friend DOES develop a cold sore: a lot of the herpes support websites say that you can't get oral herpes from sharing glasses or cutlery with a person having an outbreak. Well, I would personally be a bit hesitant about sharing a glass with someone who has a big old cold sore, as the virus can live up to four hours outside the human body. MedLine encyclopedia recommends washing eating utensils in hot water and not sharing a toothbrush with someone who's having an outbreak. Kissing is right out, even kisses on the cheek (most kids get the virus from being kissed on the cheek), and don't be getting head from this "friend" either.  As for sharing a bathroom, I guess it's CONCEIVABLE that you would get genital herpes from a toilet seat. Conditions would have to be pretty damn perfect, though. Basically, your friend would have to pee or wipe his cock on the toilet seat. Then, before four hours have passed, you would need to come in and rub YOUR genitals in his still-wet juices (since you can't contract herpes through normal unbroken skin like your legs or buttcheeks). I don't know about you, but my genitals tend to give the toilet seat a miss and go for that big hole in the middle. If you're really worried about it, you can just wipe the seat before you sit.    Finally, another scenario for transmission that you might want to think about: your friend is having an outbreak. He touches himself, and then shakes your hand before washing his own. You promptly run off to the bathroom to masturbate for some reason, and don't wash YOUR hands first. You could (chances are slim) get genital herpes. Moral of the story? Wash your hands before you play with your treasure.   More about Herpes   Oral herpes usually shows up as a blister on the side of your mouth--a cold sore. Genital herpes usually shows up as a cluster or blisters or sores on your genitals or anus. The sores may be painful or itchy. If you're having a really severe episode (especially the first one), you may have swollen glands or feel like you have the flu. These sores will go away (lie  dormant ) but the virus remains in your body, and the sores may pop out again from time to time (about 50% of people with genital herpes have these flare-ups, or  recurrences ).  Herpes is a really common STI. Over 50% of North Americans have already been exposed to oral herpes, and 22% to the genital kind. The two types, oral (Herpes Simplex 1) and genital (Simplex 2) are named for the regions of the body they prefer to inhabit. Oral herpes likes to live near your ear, while genital herpes likes to live near the base of your spine. The two strains are more easily aquired and are stronger on their home territory.   However, the names are a little misleading because the two herpes strains are very similar and can cross-infect. As I said above, many people acquire a Herpes Simplex 1 infection (supposedly "oral" herpes)  on their genitals  after receiving oral sex from someone with a cold sore. These infections are usually "weaker" (have less severe symptoms, and are less likely to recur) because they're not taking place on the virus' home ground. On the other hand, genital herpes is quite difficult to spread to the mouth and almost NEVER recurs there. That is, you have one outbreak and then no more.  Usually herpes is quite a mild infection. People act like genital herpes is the end of the world, but really, unless you have a crappy immune system, it's not much worse than cold sores. It's just on a different part of your body. Like cold sores, genital herpes tends to come out when you're tired or stressed. And like cold sores, genital herpes goes away and lies dormant for awhile after an outbreak. Most people have such subtle symptoms they don't even know they're infected!    Safety notes:  Herpes is generally more of a social problem than a medical problem for the people who contract it. However, any kind of genital sore increases your risk of contracting other STIs like HIV. If you are immunocompromised (e.g. have AIDS), herpes can have more serious consequences for your health. If you are expecting a baby, please consult with your doctor about your case of herpes and how it will affect your pregnancy. Finally, oral herpes can occasionally spread to the  eyes. That sucks. To prevent it, don't touch your sores. If you do, ALWAYS wash your hands. Also, NEVER spit on your contact lenses.  As with genital warts (another relatively mild infection, health consequences-wise), contracting herpes is no fun for your social life. If you do have genital herpes, you have a DUTY to tell your partners and to work out safer sex guidelines for everyone. These should include no sex at all when you're most contagious, before or during an outbreak (often people can feel an outbreak coming on, getting a tingly sensation where sores were before). Condoms don't offer good protection during an outbreak because your partner can still get infected by sores outside the condom or fluids that happen to leak over. You will most likely want to use protection (latex condoms and/or dental dams) in between outbreaks. That's because although although you are less contagious in between, asymptomatic people tend to occasionally shed, or give off, the virus at random times.
