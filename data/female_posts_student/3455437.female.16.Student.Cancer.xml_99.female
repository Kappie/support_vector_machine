Not only do I have to stay after school for an extra 2 HOURS (!!!!!!!) every Tuesday to please my ego-obsessive, powerhungry, thinks-she-knows-everything-but-can't-teach-for-shit    teacher, I ALSO have to do public speaking AND read the most boring book of all time, Yes..I am refering to "Utopia". Everytime I see Mrs Thompson (the ego-obsessive, ph, English teacher I mentioned earlier)  she gives me this like.. evil glare. She is either planning to kill me OR is a little upset just because I may have forgotten *cough* to attend a few *cough* of her extenstion classes. Maybe both.  So anyway, I pick up my book then decide to.. you know.. quickly just check my email etc.  ....2 hours later when I pull myself away from my computer (*hugs her mac*) I find that I have LOST the books!!  So I spend a further 20 minutes trying to recover the books. I don't find them... go figure. So then I decide "fuck it" I'll just study for Math (which I also have a test on because all the teacher are evil and synchronise their assesments so they are all end up due at the same time) and I can't find my notes. So now I'm not doing anything...just sitting here blogging, which is proving to be very amusing.. and listening to some J-rock. Aaaah I love Japan.  So it's 12:14 now... I've done nothing... except this post in my blog... and breakfast... etc...  ..and for your amusement: te he ^^;      Love your lord and master.. Joelle.        ..p.s. PC's suck
