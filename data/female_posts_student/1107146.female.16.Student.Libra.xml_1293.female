We played it at the party this evening.  I am totally dressing up...well, if someone else dresses up with me. And I'm totally talking like that.  I would like to be a Lady, I think...it just sounds cool...."Good morrow, my lady.  How dost thou fair this lovely morn?"  Ahhhhh...I loved playing dress-up as a child...all the wonderful memories.....(this is when i become nostalgic).....anyway...I'm looking forward to this entire weekend!  Tomorrow, I'm going on a boat all day long, Sunday, is graduation, and Monday I get to talk in an english accent for several hours!  Yay!  There are so many simple joys in life...and what time are we going?  Linds and I thought that 11:00 would be a good time to go.  So...yup...fun stuff...where is everyone, btw?
