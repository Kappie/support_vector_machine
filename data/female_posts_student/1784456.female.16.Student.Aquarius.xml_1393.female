Why can't I be the one, Who has fun in this world! Maybe my release, Comes from my bounds. It's some thing that I'm searching for, Some thing that wants to be found. Won't you help me up, Or will you fill in the hole? Did you know, That your deeper than you look, It's true for us all.  AN: Deeper as in... deep thinking, deeply psychological!
