Was he the one wearing the Burger King Drive Thru costume?  I thought that was hilarioius and original :) Anyhow, you're mom is so hilarious.  She's obviously into watching Sex and the City.  I never really got into watching the show for the very same reason that she had talked about.  Those women were clueless!  BTW, thanks for posting Hobbie and Felix's pictures.  They are both adorable!  P.S. Remind me not to eat any cookies given by Brian. :)
