I've realized that time is just crucial as hell to prepare for the much dreaded exams but admittedly, procrastination is a natural part of the holidays.  There's a lot of distraction going on of which I'm always glad- phone calls, dogs and the TV.  Our movie plans for tomorrow didn't work out so we are all left to die in front of our maths and karangan books.  What?! Harry Potter? Oh sure, let's go. I'm ready anytime!  On the other hand, I know of people who pore over their revision books and past year questions religiously, which is of course, a wise act of self-discipline and time-management.  I'm truly amazed and there's always a part of me that feels that pinch of guilt whenever I spend my time frolicking on the beach or whacking some mamak food in a different part of the country.  I'm longing for some fun just to break the monotonous life here in the city because thoughout the damn 5 days, I haven't been out to do anything fun.  Okay, besides reading Spongebob in the bookstore lately..
