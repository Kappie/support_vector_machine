I have Netball on Mondays now instead of on Sunday mornings which really sucked there for a while. Imagine this getting up at the same time on Sunday (Dimanche) that you do on weekdays when you have to get to school. My netball starts at 9 and it's in like Niddrie or something it's at St Bernards and I think thats in Niddrie could be in Airport west though. Anyway I have to get up at about 7am cause I have to eat breakfast an hour before netball so I don't get a stitch on court. My mum AND my sister have to get up as well and while I'm at Netball they go off and eat McDonald's while I am working my ass off at training. INCROYABLE !!! But it's all cool because I hate MsDonalds, in fact I really really hate McDonalds... Anyway back to Netball, to make things worse half my team turns up and then most of the people on the team don't even get to play a practice match cause we don't have a full team. As if thats not enough we haven't won a game. The whole of last season we did not win one single game!! INCROYABLE!!! Bloody hell all I can say is we better win at least one, single, game this season or I will cry. It's NOT fair.  Right now that thats off my chest I have other things to talk about to. Friday was very boring, watching hockey and to make it worse it was in freezing temperature. Went to watch Rach's hockey match unfortunately for them they did not win. Themes beat them by 2 goals. The score 3-1. I hope I spelt Themes right. Maybe it's Thames. Bah, who really cares no-ones going to read this bloody blog anyway. Unless I give them my address then they have the opportunity to read it, which I strongly recommend they do, for my blogs are very interesting. NOT! (PAS!) Je n'aime pas le blogger. Sorry I have written in French again I can't help it I need to practice or else I'll forget it, if I was in one of Mr G's classes I could speak French and I wouldn't need to write blogs in French. But it is IMPOSSIBLE, because Mr G doesn't teach our class.
