In fact he offered to give me swimming lessons or to come over and watch a baseball game or pretty much anything I wanted to do. He made sure to give me his phone number this time since I didn't volunteer mine the afternoon I met him. Sheesh it's been months and he still remembered me and is still interested.  After eleven years married to someone who didn't treat me very well it's really flattering to have someone showing so much interest in getting to know me. I really needed that.  He doesn't come across like a desperate loser either. He's very nice and he seems pretty bright.  And he's confident enough to make his intentions clear. That is a nice change.  So why does it make me uncomfortable. Well, duh, probably because it's been 12 years since  someone asked me out and in that time I haven't done anything but raise children and cry because my husband is dishonest and throws all standards of human decency out the window if his pride gets hurt. And guess who got punished for his insecurity? And I'm still reeling from the miserable year and a half I've been through. Right on the tail of a mostly unhappy ten years.  All I'm looking at here is maybe going swimming with someone and it feels wrong. After P. slept with another woman before I even moved out of the house. Twice. Two different women that is. Not quite a year apart. Ten years of porn and strippers and I'm still trying to uphold the sanctity of marriage when I don't even live with my husband.  I wouldn't lie about it either. If I were going out with someone else I would tell him first. A courtesy that wasn't extended to me. Either time. I wouldn't go out with him just for revenge either. That wouldn't be fair to the guy and it would be a wrong reason to do it. This guy doesn't deserve to be used or led on. Even if he didn't mind.  Not that the thought of revenge isn't appealing.  I rather enjoy the thought of P. lying awake at night wondering where I am and what I'm doing. He deserves to sit home as my babysitter wondering what my date looks like and whether he's kissing me. He deserves to wonder if I'm in bed with some guy whose dick is bigger than his. Whether I'm talking about him and what I'm saying about our marriage.  But I couldn't go out with someone I wasn't interested in or didn't like. That would be punishing myself. And I'm not interested in going to bed with anyone. It would only bring up a lot of bad memories and feelings. What fun is that? Knowing me I would end up crying.  But getting out of the house and spending some time with someone who wants to spend time with me would be good for me. I don't remember how normal people treat women. I suspect if I got back out into the world I would be shocked to discover just how unhealthy and emotionally abusive my relationship really was.
