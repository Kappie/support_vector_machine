Speaking of which, we have a concert on Wednesday and you should come! We're actually playing some decent stuff- the Carnival movement from "La Fiesta Mexicana", "Tatarian Dances", and "Galop", which I get to play the bass part on. Yeah I totally rock at that song. Anyways, my One-Act song is really coming along. (Hey it rhymes! hehe) The song is cool, but pretty much everything else about the play is horrible. THe humor is cheesy and I have like 2 lines. And a song. Can't forget the song. So during rehearsal, I pretty much sit there and do nothing until its times for 2 lines and song. Yeah. Meh, I have a lot of homework tonight. Not cool. Ugh, and I got a C on my algebra quiz on exponents. Grr I hate exponents! Oh and yes, notify the authorities, Liz got a C! Whateva. I had to sing the National Anthem in biology today. Fun stuff. We had work time and these two kids said, "Hey Liz, we'll give you a piece of gum if you sing." So I said okay, sang and got some gum. Sweet deal. I think I scared the teacher a little. He was a sub... but its fun to scare subs lol. I had a good time. Until tomorrow.
