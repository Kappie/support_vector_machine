So sorry boys, no go, even if I do look cute. Um...what else, matt project, sorry I haven't been on in a while. I'll try to update and keep your lives filled with the extra spicy goodness that only I can add to your lives. Hi whiskey! Hi Cooper! Oh yeah, and Hi Matt Project! lol.  I miss chatting with you all. Keep me updated on anything new! Now I'm off to whip up my resume and my ultra cool portfolio. 'Til later my bloggies, Keep the good love rockin'!
