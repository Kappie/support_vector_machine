This requires your intimate knowledge of the particular work process and the attitudes, responsibilities, and language connected to the work. (NOTE: Do not use any form of the following words: become, change, tranform.  Instead, make us exerience the transformation.)  instead i made an object (the room) transform or change into something else:  The Room  I feel that the room around me is fading The walls are shrinking Narrower and Narrower as my heart gives more and more to you 1 sq. foot, 2 sq. feet smaller The walls are closing in  quickly fading... The shadows on this heart of mine are disappearing Where is all of this going? The walls are melting down The doors to this heart are opening   My heart,   the room,  in which all my love for you,   is stored.  yeaa..i think imma change it around to fit tha Task tho..
