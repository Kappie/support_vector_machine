Last night at the football game, I looked at the horizon as the sun was almost done setting, and it was picture perfect. There was a very small streak of light painted along the bottom of the horizon, and the sky was a deep, rich blue. It made me realize how little things in life are what make it all worth while. I hadn't noticed anything like that in a long time, because I've been too caught up in the misfortunes of life. But when you just take a minute to look around, you realize the small upsettings in life only make the small, beautiful things that much better.
