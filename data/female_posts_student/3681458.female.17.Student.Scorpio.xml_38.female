Apparently he and his "girlfriend" (otherwise known as Hannah) were driving along, and decided to go "swimming" (I think he meant skinny dipping) in the pond behind his house.  He wasn't supposed to be out with her.  He starts driving through his yard with the lights off and drives on the trail... BAM!  He gets stuck in a big pile of brush.  His dad had told his neighbor that they could put their trees and crap that they cut down in their yard.  Nathan had to get his dad to help him out.  He found out later that his dad was on the front porch watching them.   Spencer and I laughed our asses off.  Thank you Big Al for the story.  Good lord, Nathan's an idiot. 7 out of 20 on your calculus test is not good Nathan...  Do not grin.  Do not laugh.  Your stupid jokes aren't funny.  Nobody's laughing with you.  We are laughing at you.   Well, been dealing with alot of crap lately.  A bunch of drama with my dad and me and some other matters.  We will see what happens.  I just hope this person doesn't fuck up again.  Otherwise they will be burned.
