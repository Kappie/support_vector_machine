She's letting me skip my last two classes because I have nothing better to do in them. We have to go to Lafayette at like 4 though...) D. Go to lafayette E. HOPEFULLY go to Meeting of the Minds...I might be a bit late...I will definatly try to make it though. If it looks like I am going to be more than 15 minutes late, I might just bag it... I am going to TRY MY HARDEST to make it there though! I want to see you all!!! F. Go home and study Okay... So yeah... I am not looking forward to summer gym. At all. Enough  said. I AM looking forward to my French final though! I can't wait! I find them sooo much fun!!! (seriously!!) Oh! And we're having an English essay on our Latin final! wOoT! Yay! Fun!!! Woohoo!!! :-D (seriously!!) Okay yeah. Now, because Sarah stopped doing her question of the day, I will start with my TRA-DA-DA! Latin/French Quotes of the day. Rules: Translate. More points if you can name speaker/ book/etc. Okay? Okay. I will not tell you if they are Latin or French. You must guess. In this round, only Sarah is exempt, because she knows a.) WHat it means and b.) Where it is from. Okay, the quote is this: " -'Mais ce n'est pas un homme! C'est un champignon!   - 'un quoi?'   -'Un champignon!!!' " 10 points for name of source and 150 points for translation. Go!   "Happy Towne: a self-sufficient community where the people are fed with the area's sole food source - a giant PopTart."
