I was watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and you know that one scene where Hagrid is explaining Voldemort to Harry for the first time, and it shows a flashbck of Harry when he was a baby? Yes, well on Harry's sleeve you can see Blue from the children's show  Blue's Clues ! Not only was Blue's Clues not even invented when Harry was that young, but it's also purely American and Muggleish. >_  Anyway, while Kelsey and I were on the phone yesterday, we made a list of uber romantic things. (Which most guys would never do, but are still really sweet.) ^_^ It was kinda fun. :P Here, you can see too...  -Kiss in the rain. (Is that one not obvious yet? =P) -Pull a blanket out and just start counting the stars together. -Swinging on the swings at the park together. -You two are kissing outside and it just starts snowing. -Falling asleep together. (Not all that romantic, but still sweet)  Heehee. ^_^ I know, terribly girly and such, but I like 'em. :)  I went to Trey's today with Kelsey today at 11. We were gonna go over there at 8 to wake them up, but we couldn't get a ride that early. And plus...Trey didn't really like the sound of us coming over there so early just so he can wake up with us laying on top of him. >_  Ian and Michael were already over there from last night but Bruce had already left. It was pretty fun. ^_^ When we first got there the guys played DDR for a while (Me and Kelsey just watched >_  I love you, Trey. Much more than I could ever explain. :) 333
