But that's alright because the summer is coming up and it'll be like one long weekend. Then another entire year of school to get through. Happy thoughts. Think happier thoughts.  I did all of my tons of homework yesterday so I would ensure today being a complete day off! I'm so glad. Today was okay though. Just okay. Four day week though, and this Friday I have my Algebra II SOL...gosh...I'm going to do so bad on that...that's okay, though...no it's not but yeah...  Next week is our last week. This is our second to last week of school. The year went by so fast!   I have a list of books I want to read and I got 5 of them at Barnes and Nobles yesterday. I want to save them for summer but it's so hard to refrain from reading them...I've already finished one of them...but I found a good alternative to this: Along with new books I've been wanting to read I've been wanting to read my favorite books over again. So I decided to read those until summer. Besides, we are reading Huck Finn in English class and super-speed and that keeps me busy.   I like to read.
