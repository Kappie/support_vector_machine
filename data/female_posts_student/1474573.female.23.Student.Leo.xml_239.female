She says she's going to fix it but even so, I had to get this out, and there really is no one to talk to about it with so I figured why not put it up here.  It seems that everyone around me is dealing with some problem or another.  Mostly romantic ones.  I have one friend who is sleeping with her buddy but they're more than fuck buddies because there's emotion there that they're too 'afraid' to discuss.  I have another friend thats in love with his best friend but cant do anything about it because she's not feeling him like that.  Another friend has been separated for a few months and is filing the divorce papers as we speak.  Yet another is breaking up with her ass...I mean man after 6 years and 2 kids.  Another friend has been actively trying to have a baby to no avail.  And lastly, a friend that just broke up because at first he was feeling the love, and the guy wasn't and then the guy was and he wasn't anymore.    I know all about all of their problems because I'm constantly talking to them about it and trying to 'help' in any way that I can.  From talking about it to avoiding talking about it.  From taking their side to playing the devil's advocate.  From listening on the phone to being there in person.  From listening to them swear off the opposite (or same) sex to signing them up to Match.com for another go 'round.  I have BAD TMJ issues because I worry so much about everyone.  Oh, and dont get me started on how much I worry about Steve.  Lordy lordy lordy.    Me? I havent been able to talk about me to anyone really.  I feel like my problems have taken second place to everyone else's because I dont have much to complain about.  My life is good.  I'm extremely happy in my relationship and even though I've gained a significant amount of weight since meeting my hunny, I wouldnt change a thing if I could do it all again. (ok, maybe I wouldnt eat so much and I'd have exercised more, but that's it.)  That said, not having that much to complain about doesnt mean I have *nothing* to complain about.  My grandmother has been in and out of the hospital for the past 2 months or so.  She's got congestive heart failure which basically means that her heart is weakening, and isnt able to circulate her blood as well, causing her to have fluid in her lungs which causes her to not be able to breathe as well...so basically she doesnt look good.  She looks OLD and tired and more than anything else, I wish I could be more  there  for her.  As it is, I can hardly communicate with her because my grasp on the Spanish language is so limited I always need an interpreter around if I cant figure out how to say what I want to say... another problem is I dont know WHAT to say.  I cant say that I'm indifferent but when my father was sick, it was so much easier to just hang out and talk to him about shit.  I was able to tell him how much I loved him before he died whereas I cant really express that with my granny and it hurts.  What also hurts is that my brother and I are kinda sorta on the outs, my other brother I dont really have much to say to because we're so different and my mother? Oh lordy, lets not even get into that.  Nice woman with the best intentions but she drives me batty.  What scares me most of all is that I see a lot of myself in her.  I'm scared that when my granny passes away, we'll have nothing to keep us together.  What scares me even more is when I wonder if that's really such a bad thing...  I'm graduating in June (if I could just pass this one Spanish class - another thing to stress about daily) and yet I have no plans to go to grad school or go into the Psychology field.  I'm totally content with my job.  The only thing I really want is a baby.  It seems like its all I can think about lately.  Even through all the pain that my friends are going through.  Even though I know this world can be pretty fucked up.  Sue me.  I just want one with all my heart.  ...And yet I fear - no, I KNOW - I'll drive my kid crazy (it's inevitable).  At the end of the day I feel drained.  The advice I give to my friends is almost never heeded which drives me bonkers and I'm just fuckin' beat from THINKING so much.  Why cant I just stop THINKING and WORRYING?!?  Why is it so hard to let everyone just live their lives as they see fit?  Has the maternal instinct in me just taken it that much further?  Will I ever stop?  Is anyone truly, truly happy?
