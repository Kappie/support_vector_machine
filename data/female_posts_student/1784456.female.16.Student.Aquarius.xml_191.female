Ok, so i probably spelt it wrong, oh well. So -SWEETCORN! if anyone can tell me what dreaming about running through fields of sweetcorn with no clothes on means, please tell me! And er - being chased by loads of people and a helicopter. Nothing unusual! I've had that dream 3 times in the last week and its really freaking me out!
