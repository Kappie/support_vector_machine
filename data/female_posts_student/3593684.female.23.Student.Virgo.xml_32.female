I forget my family member's birthdays I take on a lover (Mr. NYU) even though I am already in love with some one else (David) Then I forget my new lover's birthday When I am attending the wedding of a girl I have known since the first grade, I finding myself desperately wishing to be somewhere where else.  I can't even maintain this fucking blog, even though I am plagued by the need to write.  And now I am being called off to attend to business.  In brief, nothing is alright right now.  David is an asshole, Mr. NYU is just about perfect and I am shallow and stupid because I am still in love with the former and am still putting the latter on hold.
