I really think that's the story of my life. ha.. ha. i am the queen of over analizing things. I sit here with sam, and we just go over shit.. over and over.... till we're so frazzled that we've really gone nowhere.   but I guess that's waht makes us girls.       You know what. boys are really confusing. I mean ppl always say it's the girls, but we're really straight forward. I mean we know how to do things, and once you figure that out, it doesn't change. .... but boys. jeebus. it's always different. but i guess you gotta love them for it.  well again im really just blabbing about NOTHING.. so u know.    buhbye.
