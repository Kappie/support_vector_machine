We were sitting in the shortcut hall after school with Amanda and Kristina and we were just talking and it was so much fun. And then they had to leave so it was just me and Mark again and that was even more fun XD Sorry, I just can't really help it there. I'm getting mad. I'm talking to someone who I really shouldn't be, and I'm remembering why I shouldn't talk to him.... grrrrr... Oh well, he doesn't effect me (other than getting me mad) So yeah, I'm done here.
