I can do better.  Nothing much else to really add, Maple's gone on to Her new home and Andrew threw hissy fits. Seriously... the last time I saw him that upset was 6 years ago at Mom's funeral.... blah.. didn't need to bring that up.    - -Your love is like a summer rain, washing all my doubts away. Seven days and seven nights of thunder, the waters rising and I'm slipping under, I think I fell in love with the 8th World Wonder.- -     That's all I have to add, normal day of school tomorrow. Free of exams as far as I know. Crap, I didn't write my play scene for Creative Writing. Ugh. Oh well, I'll fake my way through it.  Have I mentioned lately just how messed up the male race is? They confuse the hell outta me.
