There's always the general inquiry of my day to day health, or my mood of the moment, but the knowledge that they really seek is that of my love life.  So sit down, shut up and strap in for the story.   I like this guy, but sadly, he got a girlfriend.  I don't really know how he felt about me pre-girlfriend, and I definitely have no idea how he feels about me now.  I guess what we had before could have been constituted as a mutual like (of the friend sort) of each other, and we got along really well.  We had things in common, mutual interests, and "bonded" over them.  However, things have changed.  I remember saying to Amy that I wish that he acted like an ogar to me so I would stop liking him, but sadly, that's just not his style.  He's one of those genuinely nice guys that you just can't hate.  (One of the main reasons for me liking him, which ironically makes me hate him).  Anyways, now that I see him less, (until a couple of days ago it had been nearly 2 weeks since I had seen him), I've been feeling like I like him less, like him getting over him, but then I see him and all those stupid feelings come rushing back.  The thing is, just after he started going out with her, he was still himself, friendly and just... him.  Now, he's not so "him".  I don't know if he knows I want him to act like an "Ogar" or if he's doing this on his own accord... or maybe he wasn't acting differently at all... it might have been a bad day or he was tired, or something like that that would ulter his mood.   The thing is... Despite all my complaining and feelings of heartbreak, I don't want him to change, I don't want anything to change.  Girlfriend or no girlfriend I still liked what we had... whatever the hell it was.  It was nice, and friendly, and... It just made things better.  So many times I was in a shitty mood before seeing him, but after talking to him everything seem better.  I hate that I want him, and even more so, I hate that I like his girlfriend.  Despite the popular belief on what I "should" feel towards her, she's so nice and funny, I just can't hate her.   It kills me, they're great together, (at least from what I see of them) and they make each other happy.  They almost seem more like best friends then bf/gf, but I guess that's what works for them.   Why do I have to like him.  It's just... I just...  It doesn't seem fair.  Why do I never win the guy in the end.  I'm always the one on the side congratulating the winner on a job well done.  What am I supposed to do?  Fight for a guy who doesn't want me?  Yea, that seems like a productive use of my time.   Is my perception of him changing, or is he changing.   Is he changing on his own, or is she changing him? Does he even have any room in his life left for me?
