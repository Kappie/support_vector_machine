My mother and I were at Safeway, and this  huge  lady in a tied-died shirt was standing in the middle of the pickle aisle. She had her cart and large body blocking the whole aisle. We were after the ketchup se was inconveniently standing in front of. I glanced at her, and she just stared at me. So i decided to maybe ask her to move. I said "Excuse me" and tried to get past her flub, but she just stood there, starring at the relish. Then she randomly grabbed the cart and shoved past me like  she  was mad at  me . So my mum and I were like, ok.... yeah. So we got our groceries and left. We were in the car and there was a group of 3 obese people waiting at the bus stop and they were all wearing tie-died shirts, me and my mum were joking and said that the fast relish gazing woman was probably part of their little clan.   THEN, we went to McDonalds to get something to eat, before I went to an Audition to be an extra in some movie "Nearing Grace" and we ate in the restaurant. There was a guy wearing a TD shirt, holding a small soda, just staring at the wall. My mum and I just started laughing, and he looked at us then took another drink. Then resumed looking at the wall. I mean it was just a plain white wall, but okay.  So we were laughing and driving home, and saw a bum pushing a cart in downtown portland. He was wearing a TD shirt and just walking like a robot. That's when we got all freaked out and were like AHH!  So just as a warning to all you people out there, Tie-Died shirt people are wandering around the country, pretending to be average civilians, but they are NOT. They are aliens from another planet and they want to turn us all into gazing hippe people. BEWARE. lol. actually it was all probably a coincidence, but you never know, so be careful, take a buddy if you walk in the dark! :)  Oh and, avoid the fat hippies that block pickle aisles. We may have to start our own Berlin Airlift. We shall call it The Safeway Aislelift. I donno.
