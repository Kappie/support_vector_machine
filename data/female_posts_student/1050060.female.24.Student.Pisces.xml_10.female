Charles was trying to fix this fishing pole and he caught a big fish and after that Katie wanted to catch one also. She worked hard and did catch one before we left. It was kind of funny and we had a get time. Jo, Katie, Robert, Charles and I went on a boat for a while too. It was great. Jo and Katie got a sun burn but i didn't. Anyways have a good day!
