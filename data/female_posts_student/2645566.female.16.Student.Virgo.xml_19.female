I feel like I'm neglecting my friends (those of them that still like to spend time with me that is). I feel as if no matter what I do, I'm failing my mother and my religion. I think I'm going to fail Chemistry...and no one will help me with it. It's all just too much for my poor pitiful brain to take in. Yes, Poor, Pitiful.   I wish I could jump ahead to the summer. That would be nice. I want to do a lot of things this summer. Mostly just spend time with my friends and Paul. Just hang out. I guess that's what I'm gonna be doing over spring break though. Laying around. Paul has school the first week and my friends will more than likely have other stuff to do. *sigh* this bites.     Okay, I have to get this off my chest. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN SOMEONE THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS DECENT TELLS YOU THAT YOU SHOULD GO KILL YOURSELF!?!?! How fucking rude right? I sure as hell thought so. Especially since I had JUST finished saying that I was having a HORRIBLE day!!!! "why don't you just go kill yourself"...grrr....Yeah, real mature there right?? I wish I could leave this place forever...or fast-forward life.
