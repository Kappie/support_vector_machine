It may just be monday, but I think this might be another good week. Except for friday. That's going to suck. Stupid band. Oh well. For now, I'm still in a pretty good mood. Rehersal isn't bad, and the two hour delay was fun. "It's such a beautiful day" Yummeow.  I don't know.  "you know, when I'm with you and we're not being interrupted by anyone, It's like being completely at peace with everything"
