How could I have known, You didn't love me too ? You held the key, the key to my emotions, Why didn't I see? you didn't really care about me  You were always so nice, How could I have know? I should have thought twice,  but my infactuation was full-blown, You flirted with someone else, Maybe you thought I wouldn't mind, You still kept taking off your belts, but I'm not quite that blind.  How could I have thought,   That this was all true? How could I have known, You didn't love me too ? You held the key, the key to my emotions, Why didn't I see? you didn't really care about me  We broke up after not too long, It was so hard to forget everything, I keep hearing all of your songs, Then my phone started to ring, You said how you missed me, kissing wouldn't satisfy you, It's other things that you wanted from me, so I tried some things that were new.  How could I have thought,  That this was all true? How could I have known, You didn't love me too ? You held the key, the key to my emotions, Why didn't I see? you didn't really care about me  I gave in to things I didn't want to do, I wouldn't have minded to be friends, Then you told me we were through, you brought it all to an end, acquaintences is what you wanted to be, So tell me, what are we left with? At last you can be free, So now I'm just a memory.  How could I have thought, That this was all true? How could I have known, You didn't love me too? You held the key, the key to my emotions, Why didn't I see? You didn't really care about me
