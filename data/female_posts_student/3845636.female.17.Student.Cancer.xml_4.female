How many of you believe in it? well, personally I think such stuffs can be quite subjective but after reading all those books about character analysis and all about the horoscope 'Cancer' (Crab! crab!) I think it's quite accurate in my case... the predictions on a daily or weekly basis are quite true too~ This is scary man... I wonder how do these ppl read each other's minds or to even foresee the future.  Received an e-mail regarding such horoscopes... and here it is:   CANCER WOMAN    When she is in love, she will act both ways. First, Shy and polite trembling  to be near you. Second, Attach to you like glue and trying to be with you  all the times. She will try to go home with you after work, or have every  lunch with you. It is O.K. if you like her too, but if is is not the case,  you will feel very uncomfortable.   She hates to be talked about or gossiped by someone else. If she knows she  will be very hurt. In nature she is a shy type, except she has been  influenced by some other Zodiac. She is not a brave or daring type, so if  you like her then you better be the one who start first. She will not accept  her true feeling, so if you like her you better tell her first.   She is like a musical note always change in tunes, so one minute she can be  funny and cheerful, and one minute she can be sad and depress. Other people  may think of her as "Over-acting", or "Over-reacting".   When she is depress, she will go out and look for things to make it up. She  loves money, and thinks of having "Money" as "happy", not as "God". She will  not look down at you if you do not have a lot of money, but she will help  you make money, save money. She is not an extravagant person and sometimes  will tell you not to buy her expensive and not useful gift.   She is the type who enjoy a long and quiet walk. Cancer woman also  influenced by the "moon", so under the moon light she will be fascinating  woman.   She has a constant fear for many things. She fear of not being smart enough,  not pretty enough. Even if she is not fat, she will not be satisfy. Assuring  her of her look would help, because she can change mood 4 times a day.   She is not stingy, but you will not surprise if you see she collecting old  or broken junks. She sees that everything are useful to her. She will find a  way to re-use it again some day. She is not a jealous type,but possessive.   The best part of her is that she will sacrifice everything for her love one  with no limit. Don't leave her in times of troubles, she will never forget  it. She is not a weak type, even she looks like one, Example if you argue  with her, she might cry her heart out. Once you left, she will wipe her  tears and start clean up her apartment normally.   She is a very careful mother and will look after her kids every steps of the  way. If she is a mother of your children, you are at ease, but if she is  your mother in law, you are in pain. Not to worry, this type of mother in  law will not let her own daughter being an "Old mate".   She could be moody and argue with you in many little things like many women,  but she always wait and want to take care of you. If you argue with her and  disappear a few days, she will be waiting for you, but not for long O.K.  This kind of testing is risky, try not to do it.   The Cancer woman need 2 things to be happy which are "Work" and "Love". She  can be live in a dusty house, but she can not live in that same house with  no Love.    Haha~ after reading this results... maybe I would like to take back my words at the start of this blog. erm.. guess this character analysis is only 60-70% true. Anyway that's all then... tata
