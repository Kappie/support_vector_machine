But regardless, i have to put this ointment in his eye twice a day and im sure the first time i try to hold him still and do that he's gonna rip my hand off and then i'll bleed to death and then my hamster will take over the world...and....*falls into a daze* I can't let that happen!!!! Today was fun, hung out with Ellen and then went to Tj's and Keith was there too and then we hung out at my house and then Ellen stayed for dinner (and somewhere in there we went to the vet) and now ellen is playing some skateboard game on my gamecube and some time tonight we're gonna go to blockbuster and rent It Takes Two *plz dont ask* and Eurotrip! Woot et woot.   Toodles! -Kelz0rz
