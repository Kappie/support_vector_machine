I stereotyped Hannah yesterday - Weirdo Loner Goth.  We even have tables in our Maths room. The Chav table, the Goth table, and the mixed tables. Admittedly, we should sit at the Goth table, but then we would be classed as "Popular" Goths. Ew.  Never mind.  Our Art teacher sucks. Hannah got to do cool things and we have to draw shells and colour them in.o0  Yay! In music we get to do a presentation of one of our favourite bands. Me and Sophi are doing Darling Violetta. Even though she has never heard them :)  Never mind.  Moo Moo.  Bah Bah.  I have talked about school all the way through this.  Hmm.  xx
