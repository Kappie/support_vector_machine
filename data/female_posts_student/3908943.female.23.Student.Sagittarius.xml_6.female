I had went to a store to get some stuff and then head over to a friends house for the evening.  I run into an old friend of mine that I had known almost all my life.  We had liked each other at one point but never did get together because we thought we were so different that it wouldn't work.  Turns out we ended up a lot alike.  Both have degrees in Psychology in which we are not happy with so he's going to go get another degree.  He's only here for the summer 'cause he can't stand this city either.  There were a bunch of things, but you get the basic idea.  We both found it funny that we had almost too much in common now.  We talked for over an hour.  We said our goodbyes and that was it - just never know when irony will pop up.     I was at my friends house for the day.  We were trying to create something - no luck so far though, so I gotta go back today and see if we can do it.  Its supposed to be a surprise so I can't tell you all what it is yet, but her and I at least are having fun working on this project.  I got to talk to her cousin who was also one of my best friends in high school.  I hadn't talked to her or seen her since a year after I graduated from there.  She lives in Virginia now - her cousin here (my friend who I hang out with here) is going there to visit her and go to a wedding of yet another one of our friends in August.  I wanted to go, but I'll be moving into WIU that week.     My beautiful Pontiac Grand AM gets fixed tomorrow, so I can use it again.  Although I like my mom's new car (which I feel like is my home now after all the driving I've done in the last week), I miss mine and I can't wait to have it back!  Fun times in the "pimpmobile" (courtesy of my friend Courtney).  I really miss the 'old group' I used to hang out with before we all graduated.  Love you guys and hope to see you soon!
