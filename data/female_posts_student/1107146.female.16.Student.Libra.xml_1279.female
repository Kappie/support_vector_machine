But I think that you guys know what you need to do, but keep skirting around it.  In my opinion, it seems like you guys have "decided" to just stop "interacting" with Becca, but are scared to see what will happen when you actually say the words.  I think you know what will happen.  There will be tears, there will be yelling, there will be pretty much every emotion you have experienced and some you haven't.  It will be hard, but I think thats what you guys need to do.  Please don't take my opinion too seriously though.  I really don't know any of you, except for Linds, Josh and Becca.  This is just what I've deducted from hearing about the situations from the blog and Linds.    I know this might be a kinda bad time to say this, but I really need help with a food drive I'm in charge of at church.  On Sunday, I (and a whole bunch of other people) are handing out plastic bags with a list of food that the Nashville Rescue Misson needs.  I was able to get about 1000 plastic bags donated by Wal-Mart, but I need people to help staple the list to the bag.  If any of you could get to Brentwood Methodist between 5 and 5:15, (and maybe bring a stapler) I would be really really really appreciative.  I'll even bake some cookies, if that entices anyone.  Slight disclaimer though, Becca does go to Wednesday night stuff at church and most likely will be there at that time.
