Thought you might appreciate it more than me seeing as your neighbours and every thing.... Get your mum to listen to it! Ahh, I'm so happy, we won't have to cope without music or tv in spain! They have a tv and a cd player so we're taking a load of cd's! Oh, the cats have gone. :'( Mango was trying to escape out of the basket and he was hogging all the room! Cleo was squashed up in the corner some where and Mango was just going mad. I don't think they wanted to leave us! Aww, how cute... Or maybe some one forgot to feed them this morning...? Mmm... well Broadie was sitting silently so I think they had been fed. Aww, I'm leaving for two weeks! (Duh!) Hmm, I'll miss every one! I better go.... do what I do...? Bubi!
