After that we recorded ourselves dancing to Michael Jackson, it was so funny, it included: Billy Jean, Earth Song, Smooth Criminal, Thriller and the other one that I really like... what is it???  urlLink   ... GOT IT! Don't Stop Till You Get Enough... something like that anyway!!!  urlLink   . After that we went to the party. I filmed us making our way through... then I filmed Ian having a fag, I found it extremely boring!!!  urlLink    hehehe! Well yeah, we went in, we sat down with Russell. He wasn't singing Iris though, he sang Nickleback, How You Remind Me. Which is totally rude  urlLink   . Well yeah, the first game was this balloon popping thing, Ian went in it so I was left alone  urlLink   . When we had dinner (earlier on, before the party) he said that if I sat in the room with him he would never leave me. Well he  urlLink    Ian played the game so I sat with Stacey. After that was another game, you had to "mingle" on the floor and when Cally (the leader lady) shouted out a number you had to get into groups of that number, so in the first round I did it, got dragged into one group then deserted because there wasn't enough people, whilst doing this after being punched in the head by the pastor  urlLink   . So I was out on the first go. After that we were in this game and you had to go with a boy, so I went with Ian. We had to do something like when they shouted "cavalry" Ian had to lift me up, when they shouted "horseback" I had to jump on his back and when they shouted "knight" I had to sit on his lap. Ian is like anorexic, and I'm quite big so it was so funny seeing him lift me up! We came third!!! After him trying to lift me up resulted in him putting his hand up my skirt  urlLink   . After that they got into groups and had to do this wheelbarrow thing, had to eat something then come back. Luckily for me I had to judge them to see if they went over the line, I really appreciated this job, Gary spat this yellow THING at me! It was gross...  urlLink   . After that they got into REALLY big groups adn they had to find something then rush it into the centre. One of the things were to find someone with their belly pierced and carry them into the middle. No One else had their belly pierced! I should of said something, I was the only one with it done!!!  urlLink   ... um not quite!!! Well yeah, after that was munchimoos. I managed yesterday to eat only my advent calendar and 6 ferroro roches! I'm so proud of myself. I'm 8 and a half stone, remember that! Then next week I'll weigh myself again, and see waht I am. I know its a only a day of "dieting" but you can already see the difference!  urlLink    hopefully I'll be like Ian soon! I wish you could put photos an this thing, you probably can but I can't because I'm stupid. When everyone else was eating I was talking to Russ. He said that if I wrote the lyrics for Iris then they would do it. After I had done it, Russ and Ian laughed at me adn said that they wouldn't. So I gave Tanzina they lyrics. After that was the cavalray or something liek that. It had people singing and stuff. I recorded that aswell! Claire, Carri Anne, Collette and Heather sang, all was good but Heather was REALLY good, she sounded exactly like Britney Spears.  urlLink   .  Oh how embarrassing! My sister is singing to the Buffy Musical...  urlLink   . Yeah well... back to last night, then Dan did this magic trick thing, great fun!!! Then Ian, Russ, some dude called Sam, Sammy, Danny, Joe (I think thats it!) I can't remember the dude on the drums... did Nickelback. It was good, Ian just looked really pathetic because the main singer, Sam, was really good and he like didn't let Ian join in, it looked so funny! After that we went home. Letty phoned me, she was drunk and she had pulled some lad from London and she sang. I woke up to Letty ringing me!!!  urlLink   . She told me about her spewing over Alana, Rich, and the wall! I'm soooooooooooooooooooo proud of her!!! I will tell you why new years, it would of been a year since then... I went on here last night, then I went to bed. I've had a shower and I'm feeling fresh. Well I better be going, Letty is coming round soon. Bye guys xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx urlLink
