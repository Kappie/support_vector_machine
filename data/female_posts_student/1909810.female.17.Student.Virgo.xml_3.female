I hate math, I hate coming back from lunch to walk in to a class of 39 students in a tiny classroom with windows the size of...well I don't know what size they are of but they are fricken small windows(smaller than any of my other clases)...listening to a teacher go on in monotone about math terms I have yet to learn because I have not once gotten through a day of math with out spacing out. Wow.   I'm getting out of my French class, there is no fricken way I can stay in that class. My mother is going to help me, maybe take a correspondence class with a tutor and just not have a fourth period. High school is hell.  But ahh..the weekend is almost here, and quickly it will be gone again, but I can always look forward to another.
