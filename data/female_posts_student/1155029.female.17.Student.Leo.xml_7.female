On the bus Spencer and Jeremiah were plotting on how to rip out my earings w/o my noticing. So, a normal bus ride.   I'll have to buy tickets next week for Valentines. Going alone isn't looking so hot. Being alone is a frown, especially with this kind of thing.   Well I'm going to run, not literally naturally,being exhausted.
