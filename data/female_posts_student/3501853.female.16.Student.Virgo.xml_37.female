Got ready for work. Went to work, busy and tiring. Came home to eat dinner, pad thai yummy again; showered; got ready. Went out aferwards till 12 when it started downpouring. Got home safely somehow, thank god. I need sleep, lots of it...     *how do you fall out of love with the only one who made your heart and knees turn in *how do you handle memories of screwing up 2 lose someone who was exactly like you without losing a part of u w/the memories
