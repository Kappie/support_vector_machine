I believe that that is how I shall refer to him from this point forward.  Hey, at least he bought me stuff.  Linds, I just happened not to have my cell on at that moment when you called...and who had to call twenty times before she spoke to a real person and not voicemail?  Who?  Who?  Anyone?  Was it Liz?  Yep, that's right.  ;)  Just kidding.  Glad everything was cool with your cousins, and sorry to hear that you made everyone mad and that you left your cell phone there.  And you neglected to tell me that you CUT your HAIR.  YOU.  LINDS.  MS. "I DON'T CUT MY HAIR" GIRL.  So...anyway, enough with the caps.  A big enthusiastic hello to everyone.  Thanks for the info on the dog song, Abby.  Hope everyone else is having a bearable summer so far and unfortunately now it is time for everyone's favorite letter (Z) to leave this forum.  Valete!  ~Z
