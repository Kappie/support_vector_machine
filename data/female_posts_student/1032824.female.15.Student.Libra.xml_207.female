This explains why I haven't been able to speak and breathe properly. * Sniff sniff * Now that I have my new dosage of medicine, I am not allowed to go ice-skating on Wednesday! Boo..  I grabbed a pair of jeans, 2 tees, a pair of shorts and my S.B! from Raffles City, then my mom, my sisters (Serene and Cherryn) and I headed down to Aunty Mary's shop at Bukit Merah. When I entered her shop, the TYR Electric Wave Female Highback swimsuit caught my eye so I went to try it on immediately! :D The price was  nice  too. $64.90. My sisters got their stuffs and we were about to pay but what happened next was that Aunty Mary insisted on giving them all to us, free of charge! I was so happy I almost carried her up! A pity I didn't get to see  Ah-Ma . Uncle Jacky was there too. Then there's Aunty Irene and LiJin Jie.. I love them. :) I love Mummy!   Jason and I plan to give Jeremy a makeover hair-cut on his birthday. I think we're going to Jantzen. Is that how you spell it? Jason went to Storm and Kimage but he felt that they weren't as good as Jantzen. Jeremy has already agreed to it but as usual, he wouldn't stop whining! Haa haa. I hope it turns out well.    P.S:  Recruit Coolio won Celebrity Boot Camp.  P.P.S:  Learn this:   Expecto Patronum!  (Conjures a Patronus, a silvery phantom shape, usually that of an animal, which is the embodiment of the positive thoughts of the caster. A Patronus will drive away Dementors.)    I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. Mischief managed.  ;)
