David's been there the whole time...and David's all love love love love April! and what does my idiotic sister do? go away David! i need time alone, David! it's just...damn it...what is wrong with her? cant she see what David's done for her? there are so many things that David's done for her. and she just...ugh! alright...nevermind...  later...
