Anyway, nostalgic as it is.. it was filmed way before I was born.  1946. At hour 15 and 1 minute Chris Pirillo at Call for Help-athon lost his sanity and started laughing madly nonstop.  Morgan Webb had to relieve him of his dutyship for a while.  I applaude him for his staying power.  I thought he would crack after 9 hours.  Speaking of staying power I have watched the Helpathon now for over 6 hours and I am starting to get beat.  Anyway I will have to give Dot some quality time this weekend for letting me watch my favorite channel on cable for the most part of the day and all night.  I did get to bring my car to the shop for its tuneup and inspection.  Turns out the rear brake drums also needed to be replaced.  I guess the frequent braking in the snow took its tool the night before.  I spent an extra hundred simoleons to replace it.    more to come.  NET
