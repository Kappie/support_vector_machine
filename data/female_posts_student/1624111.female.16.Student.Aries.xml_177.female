If you love anyone, and I mean you can say "I love you" without cringing a little on the inside because you know it's not absolutely true beyond a doubt... then you love them unconditionally. Because, although love can arguably have many faces, love...in its pure, elemental form is the only kind of love that deserves to be called love. Infatuation is not love. Lust is not love. Fear is not love. Familiarity is not love. Fondness is not love. None of those are even types of love. Love oughtn't to have types! Save, perhaps, the distinction between romantic love and nonromantic love. Because i do believe you can love someone with all your heart and soul and yet have no desire to kiss them passionately in the pouring rain. But i think if you love anyone, and have any right to use the word love, then by definition you love them unconditionally. Because what is love with limitations? I love you except when you get on my nerves? I love you only when you tell me i'm beautiful? I love you only if you'll let me cheat on you? I love you only on Tuesdays? I love you only when you're in a good mood? I love you only when Im in a good mood? What is that? You ought to love someone always, even when you feel like you never want to see them again...you still ought to close your eyes and look past all that anger deep inside your heart and know with certainty that, no matter how much you dislike them right now, its nothing compared to how much you really like them for everything they are. For everyting they are! When you love someone, you're supposed to love them for everything they are! And isn't that, in itself, unconditional love? I love everything you are, no exceptions? If you love anyone, and love them without a conscience driven "but..." you love them unconditionally. Don't you? Doesn't "unconditionally" mean in good times, in bad times, in sickness, and in health, for richer or poorer? Doesnt "unconditionally" mean you love them when youre happy, you love them when youre sad, you love them when they make life wonderful, you love them when they drive you crazy, you love them when you're their world, you love them when theyre upset with you, you love them when they're with you, you love them when you're apart?      Id venture to say love doesn't always last, because life gets in the way. But doesn't a part of you always love them anyway? Despite life? Despite how hard you try not to?  I dont know... im no expert. I dont pretend to be... i just... was thinking. About why it's so hard to be mad at Emily...actually.   but anyway. leave me some comments. perhaps ill post this on lj too. Just cause i havent put anything on there in a while
