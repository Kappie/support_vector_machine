Ron Eous, of the international Institute of Geographic Studies, has recently prepared a preliminary report on a newly discovered tribe of people in the rainforest known as the Nacirema. Dr. Eous is an anthropologist, a scientist who studies the culture of humans. His observations show the Nacirema tribe to be a strange and complex people with many contradictions. While he does not fully understand this unusual tribe, he has recorded many of their customs.  The Nacirema have perfected the art of making paper from wood pulp and are so proud of this achievement that paper has become one of the most valuable and cherished things in their culture. Those who are able to make and accumulate a great deal of paper are considered to be the wisest and most powerful people in the society. It is still not known why they place so much value on something that is relatively easy to make, but it is known that they will often decorate the paper with paintings of great leaders and prayers to their god.  The religion of this tribe is very difficult to understand because the Nacirema soon to have many different gods. Scientists are unsure if they are all part of the same religion, or if there are many religions in the culture. It is known that what the Nacirema say they believe is often very different from the way they act. Almost all of their gods instruct the people to treat the other members of the tribe with love. Yet, it is known that this culture is one of the most violent that anthropologists have ever discovered. They will fight and even kill each other over articles of clothing, decorated paper scraps, and minor incidents of various kinds. Many of the tribal games result in serious injury, paralysis, and even death. These rituals are frightening to watch because often those watching will get worked into such a frenzy that they start fighting among themselves.  They are a tribe which is very wealthy according to their own standards, but scientists have found that some Nacirema, many of them children, have no homes and not enough to eat. It is thought that the Nacirema consider these people to be unfit outcasts. They do not know what to do with these undesirables, so they keep them separate from the rest of the tribe. When the tribe goes to war, it often uses these outcasts as fighters.  The Nacirema place a great deal of emphasis on their own personal beauty. The women use paints made from the blubber of whales or the fat of animals to color their faces, and many also use sharp sticks to poke holes in the ears, nose, eye lids, tongue, and other body parts. Men do not generally use the face paints, but many show their masculinity by scraping off the top layer of their facial skin with a sharp blade. Both the men and women like to smear on a strong smelling, greasy substance which comes from the glands of a deer. The women will also apply a substance made from fish scales, which the men find very attractive. Also, it is not unusual for the most elite man and women to go to the village witch doctor in order to have parts of their bodies cut away. Many of the Nacirema consider this to be a privilege and will work many months and even years to order to satisfy the demands of the witch doctor.  Their dietary habits are varied. However, while the culture as a whole seems to admire those who show signs of prolonged and repeated fasting, many of the people are quite gluttonous. One of the favorite meals of the Nacirema is a mashed wheat and water paste that is baked with curdled milk and sliced pig intestines.  The Nacirema Also share a strange belief that no one is really responsible for the things that they do. They believe that all actions can be attributed to forces that occurred in the past. They spend a great deal of time examining the actions of their ancestors for clues to explain their own behavior. As a result they have developed a complex code of denial which allows them to justify any behavior that is detrimental to the society. If a person can produce a reasonable excuse for wrong behavior, then that behavior is often forgiven. One of their chief forms of entertainment is the public confession of sins, indiscretions, sexual encounters, or other private matters.  What makes them so difficult to understand is that they are so contradictory. For example, the Nacirema love to keep animals in their huts and will show them a great deal of love and affections. Yet scientists have discovered that they kill more cats and dogs than any other people in the world. On one hand many people are not allowed to share the wealth of the tribe, but on the other hand, the tribe will often provide food and shelter to those who have been affected by disaster. They are willing to do battle with any other tribe, yet it is their own people they fear the most, because they are so violent to each other. They discriminate against many members of their own tribe, yet their highest tribal law is that no one person is better than another. It may take many years before anthropologists will understand this strange people.     now, concentrate on the tribe name: Nacirema  look at it backwards, it spells 'American'
