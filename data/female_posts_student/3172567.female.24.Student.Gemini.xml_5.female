She makes him feel guilty (because she's a nut case and he's gullible) about telling her to bugger off.  Well, she psychoed it up Sunday night, and as a result, Joel is on the couch.  I never thought I'd be one of those "couch=doghouse" girls, but it gets the point across so well.  He and I will be alright.  Love isn't supposed to be easy anyway, right?    In regards to my search for a girlfriend for my roomate: amazingly enough, he met someone.  Not who I would expect, but he met her no less, on his own.  She's nice enough, and cute, so hopefully it will work out.  Please, for the love of God, let it work out.    I believe I am going to make a trip to Atlanta to see 5SI on Friday.  I will be going alone.  Ordinarily, I would never do such a thing, being such a chickenshit and all.  But, its at Turner Field before a Braves Game.  So I'll be parked in a well lit lot.  They need support at their shows-the kind that knows the words to their songs-so they feel like the rock stars that they are.    until next time:)
