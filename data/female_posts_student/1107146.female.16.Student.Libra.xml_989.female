But she had awakened me before my usual waking-up time, which is about 6:00 pm.  So I went to sleep, waiting for Whit to get home.  I woke up about 4:30, and she got home a few minutes later.  So we went downstairs to watch the Jubi tour video (Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat) and we were having a lot of fun just talking and stuff, when I get really tired, so I go upstairs to sit down.  After about an hour, my headache went away, and I started working on my History.  I worked for 2 hours, and got 1 section done.  Then I noticed that my shoulder was hurting really badly, so I felt it, and there was this huge lump on it.  I got my mom to look at it, thinking it was probably some random zit or something, but no, I can't be that lucky.  I have been bitten by a brown recluse.  Yup, that's my luck, so now I can hardly move my right arm.  I am tired, lonely, and in pain.  And I'm not exactly happy.  Good Night.
