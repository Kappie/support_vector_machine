I've been having a great time catching up with people in the music dept. and just sitting around laughing.  It reminds me very much of HS band, actually... except it's not quite as clique-ish.  Plus, I think that Sally is over the whole "Jered and me talking" thing... She sat next to me in microcomputer class... and we helped each other out.  Jered looks so different!!!  He cut off his moustache and goatee!!!  He looks a lot younger without all the facial hair... Anyhow, he accidentally walked into my music theory class... as he was making his rather humourous exit, he waved hi to me, said "see ya later Kelsie" and gave me a wink.  He's such a flirt!  Of course everyone then turned to me and asked if something was brewing there.  Then I had to explain to about 15 people that he and I had a class last semester and became friends.  Ugh... Now, in addition to Mattie always trailing me, I have Brent trailing me now too.  Freshmen... Brent is much less direct about it, though.  He's a very subtle admirer... which I appreciate, because I can still be friends with him.  It's more difficult to be nice around Mattie, because I'm always afraid he's going to ask me out or try to put his arms all around me and stuff.  Anyhow... it was so funny yesterday, because me, Naomi, Sandy and Bridget went to the JPL building for some breakfast before our science class... and Brent came in... he came right over to the table (it was just me and Naomi there) and he gave me this big hug.  He was meeting some others from the music dept. for some breakfast and all.  Anyhow... after he left, Naomi was like, "Ooooh... Kelsie.  Who was that... he was ALL about giving you the big hug!"  Hahaha  She's so funny!  I explained to her that I knew him from music stuff... he's a freshman... and that he apparently developed some little thing for me over the break.  I'd never date him.  Superficial as it may seem, I like guys who are taller than me... and Brent is like, 5' 5".  He's really sweet, though... and he's a GREAT guitar player.  So, yeah... onto work stuff....  Work has been pretty great this week, too.  We had some interesting stuff go on this week... one thing is apparently Mary (another Child Care Specialist) told some of the boys in the 4th/5th grade group she'd take them to a movie this weekend.  Now, I don't know if I'm the only one... but that just seems WRONG.  I don't think that we should have outside contact with these kids.  Now, I know I'm hypocritical for saying this... given the Joe stuff from HS... but, it's just different for elementary school kids... plus, there has to be authority in our situation.  Joe had no authority with us at all... he was too casual from the get-go for that.  But anyway, she's going to not have as much of an authority standpoint with these guys... not to mention, if the other kids found out, they won't understand why THOSE boys get to go to a movie with her and not them.  At any rate, I don't think that Greg knows about it... and I now have to decide if I should say anything or not.  As it is, it was harder for ME to control that group this week, because they were always wandering off in the cafeteria (during roll) to go and talk to Mary about going to the movie this weekend.  Then yesterday I saw her talking to one of the boys' parents about it, and the Mom got pretty upset about her wanting to take her son to a movie.  She was saying to the boy, "We don't KNOW her... you can't just go out with a STRANGER to a movie... I've never even TALKED to her before...!!!"  Why is this...?  Because Mary doesn't talk to parents... EVER.  And that's one of the things she's supposed to do.  Greg has gotten really pissed at her lately because she's not doing her job very well.  She doesn't really care about what she's supposed to do.  She just tries to win the affections of the guys in the oldest group.  That's why he put me in charge of it the past two weeks.  That and he wanted to be paired up with me (since Greg W quit and Greg's had to be in ratio).  Oy... also, yesterday Steve (or Scuba Steve as we call him) came to substitute (he's an A.S.K. sub)... and he's come several times before to sub at our site... he's really cool.  He's usually pretty quiet... he really only talks to Greg and me.  And... okay... so, yesterday he was acting different around me.  Like, he walked me to my car when I left... he's never done that... and his truck wasn't THAT far from mine... I dunno what's going on there...  Anyhow... that's all for now...
