I've had nothing but the greatest respect for this priest.  He helped me (without really realizing it, or maybe he did?) to find my niche and a group of friends when I was particularly floundering upon first arriving at university.  How we met at all is a rather awkward story but suffice it to say that I think, although he insisted that he needed me as a volunteer and conversation partner over the last academic year, I needed his friendship too.  He had an uncanny way of knowing when I was worried about something even though I'd go to extraordinary lengths at pretending all was just fine.  I'd never tell him what was wrong (except this summer with my eye difficulties, so he remained updated on why I couldn't come back to visit him) but he would inevitably want to say a prayer for my intentions and that was a comfort, whatever happened to be weighing heavily on my mind.   I'm going to miss him.  More to come...
