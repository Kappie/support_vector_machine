I thoroughly enjoyed the class and shall be sore for a few days since I'm so dang sporadic about working out. At the end of the class I was showing another member how not to roll off of her fitness ball (or whatever it's called) and the teacher started asking me about whether or not I'd be interested in teaching classes. How fun would that be?! I'd basically get paid to do what I'd be doing anyway. Not a bad deal. I will have scant income in September anyway and have been racking my brain for one-month employment. They would certify me and teach me how to teach and all that. How fun! Total Woman is also going to start offering a ballet toning class. THAT would be a blast!   Now I must wait to hear from the supervisor and get more details. We'll see what happens.
