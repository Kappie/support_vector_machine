Fortunately for me they got along very nicely as I hate introducing two people who don't know the other whatsoever and wondering the whole time if they will get along or hate one another.  They got along great.  We had planned to only stay till about 8 so that we could take 66 home when it wasn't HOV in Arlington.  We showed up around 6:15-6:30.  Beth and I had a beer before Jeff even got there and he went on to buy more and more for us all evening.  We had a great time and by the time we checked the time it was 9:30.  I had had too much beer and I am glad Beth just decided it was time to take off.  So we all go our separate ways and head home.  Here's the problem.  I was drunk.  I woke up this morning with a hangover from hell which eventually turned into just a headache (not as bad as the Vodka episode months back - it's posted somewhere in the Feb or March archives).  So now I hurt.  But there is work to be done so I keep moving along.  Well sometime yesterday after hearing that Phish was breaking up I sent Jeff (work Jeff - not Jeff who I went out with last night) an email joking about how devestated he must be.  He hates hippie music.  He writes back something somewhat funny, not as good as usual but whatever, which I receive today.  I try my hardest to think of something funny to write back but my head hurts too much and there is no way.  So I proceed to tell him so.  He then tells me he's hung over as well.  I tell him I am a sucker for the $1 beers, especially when someone else is buying, he tells me I am an economist and understand a bargain when I see one...  So the conclusion is that really I was just helping out my country last night.  I mean, that's all it was.  I didn't drink too much because I am a lush, I drank too much because I needed to help boost the declining economy.  As Jeff (work) has pointed out... I am a true patriot!
