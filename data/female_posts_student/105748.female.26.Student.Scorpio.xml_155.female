Im trying to avoid the city these last few days. Im staying with my mother in Queens.  Were all just trying to take it easy. Couple of days ago, the wind changed direction and the smoke from Downtown travelled to Queens. I left a window open that night and I woke up with a headache and a bad sinus. Almost like I had an allergy attack.  I took some coffee filters and used it as a mask tieing it to my face with rubber bands.  Thank goodness it rained,  the smoke conditions have faded.  Were all trying to get back to normal.  Monday, will be the beginning of it.  Oh and for those of you who are Jewish, Tuesday is Rosh Hassanah.  The coming week is also the UN Assembly.  Its gonna be a busy week for New Yorkers.  I wish you all a safe week.  ~Net (Cent)
