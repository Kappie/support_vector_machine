I was at Chris' house last night (my mom's bf) and Haley and I were hanging out... for 13 she is pretty hilarious.   My buddy Brian and I also hung out some last night.  We drove around and then went to Garvin park and sat there for a while.  Talked... good good times.  I work with him at Target and he just graduated from Reitz this year.. lucky little devil.  I want to graduate and go to college.  I want to go to IU right now! Ashley and I are gonna be room mates.  It's gonna be great.  We are gonna have a blast there.  O.. and we get to shop for stuff for the room.  Good stuff.  More reason for me to spend money. Finally got the Alanis Morissette "Jagged Little Pill" CD from someone to archive to my computer.  So, that is kickass.  I used to have the CD, but somehow I ended up losing it.  It is an awesome CD.  I got Enya's Greatest Hits "Paint The Sky With Stars" CD to also archive to my computer.  I know I know.. its Enya... but she is really soothing.  And during a stressful day where you want to hit everything... somehow she helps.   Well.. off to get ready for work.
