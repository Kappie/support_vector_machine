Ahhh..the breakfast of champions *cue the infamous Queen song they play at burgerville 24/7*. so then i suggested seeing Envy b/c it looks like a good-ass movie. we drove around and spotted a portland tribune. i run out, snatch one, then run- baywatch style- back to the car. i opened it in hopes of finding movie listings..but no. what do i find? a picture of fat chicks in cheerleading outfits waving their poms poms hig and proud. god, that was hot. not really though. it totally killed my horny...for a couple minutes. well, we couldnt find movie listings, so we went to 2 different theatres. we found that no mainstream theatre is open before 2 'o'clock. yeah...it was like 10:30 at the time.  ok, i know it sounds boring, but i was totally entertained the whole time. we made a run to Fred Meyers and used jake's gift cards. he bought me candy and Cosmo. "aaaaaww...no..." he said. but he bought it anyway *whip cracks* just kidding....or am i? lol  jake bought a kick-ass Queen DVD and we watched that. i must say, it was kick ass.   freddy mercury w/ moustache vs. freddy sans moustache with the 'stache. all the way.
