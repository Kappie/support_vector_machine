Okay, she actually said that, roughly 6 times. my extended family is hardly tight-knit, so it was good to see people i don't get to see very often.   my sister (brendan's mom) had everyone write brendan these 'letters to the future,' to be opened on his 25th birthday. the kits are sold at most hallmark shops and the like. I just turned 25 last october, and i don't know what i would have thought if i got a batch of messages from the late 70s (when i was born) - wow, a piece of my family heritage! this is kinda lame. or check out these old 70s typefaces. graphic design has sure moved forward since then.  or who was this person? to be followed by a long tedious explanation of how they fell out with my family in the early 80s. or how many of them would just say 'have a nice life'?  the best response to my sister's urgings came from my grandma, who when asked if she would like to write Brendan a letter responded 'why? he can't read yet.'  she wrote him something anyway.  i left wondering for whom are these letters being written? we're assuming brendan will care, but for the moment, he's just drooling. maybe he can point to them as proof that his family loved him and he's not adopted? but it'll be a little late for that - those taunts usually end about age 12 or 13. the whole time capsule phenomenon seems to date back to cold war united states, or at least that's when i think it was popularized. in my mind, i associate it with backyard emergency shelters stocked with tinned food. the time capsule provides the security that everything will be alright. perhaps when brendan hits 25, his ties to mom and dad will start to wane, and the presentation of this time capsule will be intended to pull him closer to his family.      i dont' want to think about it too much - i haven't got the time.   yesterday i realized i shouldn't be a mother - brendan sneezed whilst i was holding him and instead of saying gesundheit i said 'ew'.
