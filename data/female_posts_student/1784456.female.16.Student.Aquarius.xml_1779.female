These people exploit problems in the system. *yes, it's the system* There are people out there getting away with millions of pounds of fraud and yet for the public face we look down on petty thiefs more. I think people take things too far if they don't understand or can't empathise. We're all human! *well i'm obviously from Beta 5* Anyway, seeing as my random ramblings aren't really that coherant... Back to thinking about how experiences affect you *always an easy mind numbing topic* Do you think people would be phased by pink bananas?
