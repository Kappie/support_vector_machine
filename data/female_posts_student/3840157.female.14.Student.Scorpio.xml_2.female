In darkness I start to find                   Just want a dim of light               No growth                  No voice                     No strenght                         No movement               What am I?                Cries linger in the room under the moonlight               Pain tortures me Orders stayed with me               When can the little wish of mine               Ever been granted?                Looking through my hopeless sight               Seeing them caring me with endless love               Until the end of their life.               When can I have voice to call 'Mum' and 'Dad'?                              Have you heard a sound from me?               From my heart?               The sound of my broken heart... ...  Save every life that you can,Good deeds shall never end. May God bless everyone....
