Plus, I forgot to mentioned that Grandma kept asking about Levi after my short, to the point answers followed by subject changes.  "Levi really is a nice young man.  We enjoyed meeting him the other night, especially after hearing about him for so long."  "Yea, it was.  Too bad the birthday party had to be cancelled, everyone could have met him that night.  This place gets a lot of natural, light, doesn't it?"  "Has anything developed beyond friendship with him?"  "No."  "Is anything likely to develop."  "No."  "Just friends, then?"  "Yea, I think that's why we get along so well.  Here comes Dad!  Yay!"
