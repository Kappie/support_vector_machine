I am so freaked out right now, I don't even know what to do.  I know that they're here, and they aren't even scared of me!  How is it that this stupid little creature is smarter than me, so much so that it makes me afraid to live in my own room.  I don't know what to do.  Please God, don't let them get to my shoes!!!  HELP!
