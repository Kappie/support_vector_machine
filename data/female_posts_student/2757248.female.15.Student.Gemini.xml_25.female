THURSDAY. -school -changed after school and i never realized how much ppl will stare at you if ure not wearing your uniform, not that it mattered cause everyone told me i looked cute anyways. -airport -PLAAANE -airport -HOTEL -out to eat  that was thurs. in a nutshell  --FRIDAY-- woke up early and went to the "LOBBY" to eat breakfast.. VERY NICE.  got dressed to go meet the realters at their office we got there and dad signed some papers then we went HOUSE HUNTING HOUSE 1:: not very cute.. wasnt big AT ALL HOUSE 2:: OMG had THE CUTEST DOG. it was a big house and it was reaaaalllly nice but it was like 17 years old so my dad was kinda iffy on it but it was REALLY nice so we liked it HOUSE 3:: i dun remember this house HOUSE 4:: we liked it but it was kinda not what we were looking for HOUSE 5:: MEXXXXICAN dude lived there. we didnt like the house. HOUSE 6:: *MOUTH DROPS* WOOOOW... HUGE. i fell in love. but the room that i would have didnt have a door on it so.. yeah we'd have to put one HOUSE 7:: after house 6 there was just no competition. they were kinda the same though.   after this we went back to the hotel, talked about which ones we liked and kinda chilled until like 7 then went to eat at this seafood place it was good, nice atmosphere. i had a PINA COLADA!! mmm gotta love those.  --SATURDAY--  we went back to the realters office.. iT WAS POURRRRING RAINING AND FREEZING COLD. we decided to make an offer on house 6 but wanted to take one last look at it. so we went back to the house, looked and then went back to their office. made an offer on the house and dad and lisa signed papers like ALL morning while i played black jack on my phone. which cheated btw. the realters took us out to lunch we went back to the hotel and i took a 3 hour nap cause dad was on call w/"an imp. executive" or w/e then we went to look for a resturaunt.found one the wait was 20 min. and we were starving so we just left. then went to another one the wait was 90-100 min. so we left... it must've been prom cause i saw alot of girls and guys walken around in formals which saddend me. but we ended up at a chinese rest. which was the first chinese rest. i have been to that had mexican waiters and waitresses.  went to look at the house again ....got lost..... went back to the hotel, put on my bathing suit, and went and sat in the spa which was a really stupid thing to do bc ....yeah, it just was it made me cry. cause the STARS were out. and i talked to them. then i went in and watched snl and slept  --SUNDAY-- woke up at like 630 and went back to sleep then my dad came and jumped on me and i scared him away w/the "OH SO GREAT MORNING BREATH". hehe.  got dressed went to the lobby to eat/ i think old ppl have staring problems went back to the room to get our bags checked out went to the airport.. can you say CHAOS? mk dad and lisa LEFT ME at the security checkpoints cause they like... made me STRIP. i had to take off my belt.. turn my pockets inside out.. TAKE OFF MY SHIRT.. i just told them i had a metal wire in my bra.. cause im sure they woulda made me take that off if i wouldnt have said so. thank god i wore a tank top under my shirt. then since i think they thot i was a "suspect" they made me run my bags thru the laser thingy again. after that i called my dad, he didnt even realize i wasnt w/him. caught up w/them. got on the plane. sat staring out of the window for what seems like 2 hours and we havent even taken off. so i ask dad whats wrong.. he told me.. then i went back to listening to story of the year.
