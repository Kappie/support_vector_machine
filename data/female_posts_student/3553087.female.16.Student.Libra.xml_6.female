"shes a slut shes a ho shes a freak. got a different dude every day of the week." its cool..not tryin to put a rush on you. i just gotta let you know that i gotta crush on you."  i've had that song on my mind all day. well..nothing to write about. guess i'll just be corny and write about my feelings and whats on my mind. dont you hate it how sometimes you want something/someone so badly, but there is absolutly nothing you can do to get that person/thing? i hate that. it seems as if there should be some type of option. but in some cases their is no option..you just cant have the person as hard as you try, or as much as you adore them, or as much as you wish for it. you could tell the person that you're madle in love with them and that they mean the world to you, but you know that it would do no good and would probably make the person feel guilty and uncomfortable, which is the last thing you want. true love sucks like that. i dont think anyone has ever loved me in a romantic way, even the guys that i was in love with. i guess i have some flaw, or maybe its the guys that i chose to date? i dont know..doesnt matter. because with them i always did have a chance..a chance to MAKE them love me, because it was a possibility with them. but like i said, its hard when you love someone more than you've ever loved anyone and you cant even tell them like you mean it and like you want to because you know that that rejection would only shatter your heart. i dunno..just running off at the mouth again.
