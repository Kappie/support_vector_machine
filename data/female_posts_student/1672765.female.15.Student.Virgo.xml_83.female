But I apologized.   She forgives  ME . Doesn't say anything for herself...guess she didn't do anything wrong. Whatever. Man. People totally blow. Why is everyone so selfcentered? Everyone thinks they are right, they don't ever realize when they in fact are the problem. It's stupid.  Geez.    Oh, she says sorry for making my weekend bad. Well, gosh, how sweet.  Yes, that was sarcasm.
