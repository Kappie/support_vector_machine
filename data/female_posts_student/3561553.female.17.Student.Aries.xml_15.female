Well we moved into our new house a couple weeks ago, and then we drove by the old house and there was an old fat hairy man with no shirt on standing in MY garage!!! i dont want him near that house :-( ... i miss my beach room alreaddyyyy ! ahhhhhh... My new house isnt bad though, its alot bigger and weirdly not as scary when im home alone...  Me and Tarah went and saw the movie The Notebook... It was sooo good! Tarah Cried... :- lol  ... weirdo ! Then we walked home because we need exercise... We walked up dundonald hill which is soo big and i didnt even get tireed!! wahoooooo lol... i think i might walk home from work tomorrow depending on what time i get off, cause i can't miss BIG BROTHER!! WOO...  Since i last wrote... I have played lots of baseball, worked lots, went camping, moved and hung out with people.  Baseball... hmm we lost 3 games in a row :- which makes us like 13 wins and 4 loses, or something like that... eekkk we're goin downhill.. Still in 1st place i think though... I went to the all-star game and got a homerun ! wooo and ive gotten another homerun since then as well... Last game i got up 4 times, hit the ball everytime, got a homerun and got home everytime i got up... wooo, it was good!  Welll Me and Troy went camping a few days after i moved... It was pretty fun, we went swimming like alll day everyday, we played games, ate food, fed the chippies and made them take peanuts from our legs, shoulders, and mouth! lol but it was more then halfway out of mouth so theyd get really close but its not like theyd actually touch yer mouth! it was cool though... We got these like gigantic ice cream cones! lol... we stayed up one night till like 2 sitting on the rocks that go out far into the lake with my sisters boyfriend brad... talking about like life on other planets and the future lmao... it was fun tho! we stayed out there for like 2 hours... Then when we came home from camping my dad was doing all this sanding crap with the house so all the doors were plasticed up, and since my sis and mom stayed camping me and my dad wouild b the only ones home, and i would only b able to go in the kitchen so i just slept at troys... that was fun as well !!  Then my dad went back camping and my sister came home, so i was pretty much home alone that weekend cuz my sister was always gone out... So on the saturday night after work a bunch of people from work (Beth, Matt, Steph, Ami, Ian, Robert) Came over, and so did Justine... Before everyone got there i dyed Robert and Justines hair... Then when everyone got there went to steele street and played baseball, then came back to my house, ordered pizza (wit h the money our boss gave us!) and we watched The Exorcist :S ... gross movie... When everyone left me and justine walked to tim hortons and she slept over... the next day i had baseball... and that was that haha... that was last weekend...  This week i didnt really do much... But yeah that pretty much catches you up on everything since last time i wrote... or i think it should... I'm going to watch Starting Over!!  Night!
