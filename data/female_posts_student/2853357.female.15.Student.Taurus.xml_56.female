I thought nobody was home because I had checked Ryan's room, downstairs and in the garage, and if nobody was there, then nobody was home. And I opened the door to my parents bedroom and i found  my mother  sitting on the couch...        My mother came back 3 days early...        Turns out the trip went bad... The kids were going crazy and were disrespectful. They wouldn't listen to the chaperones... The first night nobody slept, stuff like that. Mom was telling me about someone peed in someone's water containers... And my mom got into a fight...          My mother... go into... a FIGHT...          Besides my confirmation class coming, a few older kids went as well... Kids I knew by face, but I didn't really  know  them... Apparently, my mom was going to do her laundry, and one of the kids yelled at her because she didn't want to do laudry and kept asking her why she didn't pack enough clothes... stuff like that. And it got into this really big thing... and her mother got REALLY mad at my mother. My mom kept telling her that she didn't have to do laundry, but she did and so she left to do it. My mother is a pretty calm person (when she wants to be... especially in situations like this. But her mom, who was friends with my mom actually, got so pissed off at her. (Mom said she was ready to attack her.) And, if you knew my mother, she would NEVER PURPOSFULLY do something like that...It was just all a misunderstanding that got WAY out of hand...      Mom said it was mostly the older kids acting up,the 4 older girls in particular. Shetalked about how she danced with the kids (God knows how embaressed I would be if I was there...), and howTommy kept dancing to this one songthat always came up on the radio and how one kid got a migran and my mom masaged it away, and how they rooted for her when she was driving...        But there were tears shed as well... I mean, drama drama drama... Even the youth leader was crying (and he's a guy... though I still question if he's gay or not) and my mom, and the girl, and the girls mom... and the 3 other girls just HATED my mom... over this argument about LAUNDRY???      GROW UP!      They were totally disrespecting her, and my mom was actually scared for her safety. So she left...      She didn't say goodbye,shejust packed up and left... And I know they're all probably thinking she went running with her tail between her legs, but my moms not like that.She couldn't take it anymore... she didn't have toputupwith it. She said sorry thousands of times, but they wouldn't forgive her and gave her the coldshoulder or yelled ather.      This is at a trip where they went to go HELP people BUILD A FENCE for a CHURCH in MEXICO who had been ROBBEDTWICE... and all they cando is yell about LAUNDRY! WHAT THE HELL WOULD THE MEXICANS THINK! WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING... The other ministry groups were offended at our group...      If I was there... oh, I could have sorted it out...My mom's a home grownFilipina...Growing upin a military base with her father as principle and taught pilots how to fly and had a purple heart her life was STRICT discipline... Nothing like over here in America.And my mother was AFRIAD ofher father... you couldn't disobey him...        I'd let outa slew of swear words right now, but I'mcutting back... I'm really pissed off at them and crap, but... what can you do.What's done is done...      Oh, joy, can't wait to go to church when everybodies back... *groans* My mother might not care what people think about her, but I can't help it...And I can't imagine MY MOM getting along withKayla Taylor,CassandraTaylor, and Courtney Gee (freaken preps... omg,I can't imagine what the guys thought of her)... They supported her when Courtney's sister was about ready to kill my mom... I can't imagine her getting along with any of my confirmation classmates... Well, maybe AJ and Chris Vargas... People like that.        Pissed offis an understatement...        I'm going to stop talking now...         patty         All the details didn't come out right as I said it... but it went something like that...
