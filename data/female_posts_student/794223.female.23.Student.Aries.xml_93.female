This time, it's supposedly a urinary tract infection, which for most people would require a regular antibiotic and a few days to recover from. Mimi, however, is 73 and in fragile health--and, she appears to be immune to the antibiotics they are giving her.   My main concern is that she already feels depressed and discouraged from not being able to walk and take care of herself; in order to become truly motivated to do extensive physical therapy in order to walk again, she needs to see some sort of tangible improvement. However, it took over 3 months for her to end up in this weak position; therefore, it will more than likely take double that to recover--and that's  if  she's in relatively good health, without any infections.   More bad news: Brandi owes about twice as much as she thought she did to MD Anderson. These people need to understand that she is trying her best (and emptying her and her mother's bank account) in order to receive speech therapy that she desperately needs in order to continue in her recovery. Particularly since she starts teaching kindergarten in August. I for one believe that she'll be a fantastic teacher, because I know that she already is (despite current difficulties). Even after we gave her and Aunt Rite a decent penny after closing on the house in Austin, it's still a drop in the bucket compared to what she still needs. East Bernard might need to pull together again and have another fund raiser.   On a more positive note...I leave for Cuba next Wednesday. I haven't even had time to contemplate that.   I have had the chance this evening to look at the Fall 2004 schedule for the Latin American Studies MA at Tulane, and boy am I excited. Of course all the awesome classes are graduate level ;-P I've narrowed the list of choices down to about 9, though I think I only have to take 9 hrs to be a full time Grad student:    Core Seminar for LAS Grad students  International Political and Economic Relations  Information and Communication Technology for Developing Countries   Politics and Nationalism  Cuba under Castro    Modern Brazil   Sustainable Human Development I   Intro to Latin American Economic Analysis I   Haitian Creole I   Five Decades of Latin American Development   I'm not exactly sure when I need to register, but the formal period at Tulane is only a few days. I saw that with a bit of skepticism--and then I realized that Tulane is an  extremely  small school compared to my alma mater. Therefore, considering that there are only about 20 Latin American Studies Grad Students...I don't think we'll be running over eachother, clogging up the phone lines, or rushing to our comps to get the top classes. Nevertheless, I have my list ;-)
