But certain lapses of judgementindicate the radical failure of an entire sensibility."   ~Susan Sontag   Most recently I have found that Communication is more important that I thought it was.  Now don’t get me wrong, being married shows you just how much communications means to any surviving relationship –romantic or merely friends alike.  When speaking to a number of people over the Internet I have realized that there is one unmistakable truth, never say too much! Especially when those people turn around and tell others.    I take part in a PbeM on the net –several actually.  Recently there has been a HUGE miscommunication that lead to one of our command players stepping down.  Things were said, feelings were hurt, and in the end rumor served no one.  Criticism ruined his pleasurable experiance with our group and for that I am deeply saddened.  I think I realize now that making sure that you are not misrepresented by yourself –or anyone else online- is like playing the old party game “Telephone.”  You tell someone something, they turn around and tell someone else, that person relates it to another, and so on.  Soon something as simple as “I would take the job if he were to step down” turns into “Everyone hates you and Kristyn is ‘gunning’ for you job.”  Oh the hurt feelings!  I just wish I understood why things always turned out that way.  Can’t anything so simple stay so simple?  I suppose not.    “The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend.  Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again.”  The Immortal words of the great Robert Jordan.  Okay, so I am being only the slightest bit dramatic.  Still when things turn into such a mess, and feelings are hurt, eventually they will be forgotten by all but the one person who was hurt the most.  I suppose the politics are always there, behind everything that is good and fun lurks an evil imp that seeks to destroy someone.  Trying to avoid being that one is the tricky part.  I think that imp also preys on the language barrier.  In different countries, things are precieved differently.  I do however believe that this proverbial imp is not necessarily a person but rather a dark though or radical criticism at the wrong time and expressed to the wrong person.  Still, all being said and true.  I think that in the end no one ever meant to hurt anyone else, it just happens.  Inevitably, beyond reason, feeling, friendship, or fun, someone always ends up hurt in the end.  So I believe that if every person in the world would just take one day and try their hardest to not criticize or hurt anyone else the world would be much better for the effort.  ~Kristyn
