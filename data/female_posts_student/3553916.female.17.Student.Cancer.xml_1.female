True, I dont have to pick up other people's waste, clean the houses of people I take no pride in, or systematically pass food through a check out; however I dont feel that these jobs are of much less benefit than mine. The first obstacle is that I work in the evening, so on Friday and Saturday night, instead of being able to go out early and relax, i prepare for an evening at work.  Secondly, the people that I work with. It is hard to make conversation with a middle aged man who has nothing else but the pub he works in, 3 women I barley know anything about, and a landlord who comes in after having a bath in aftershave, which smells like the sort of vinegar you have had in your cupboard for months and is impossible to tell what era it actually came from. So as is imaginable the atmosphere between us all is little to be desired. Conversations consist of the weather, how the pub has run for the week when thankfully i wasn't there, and what needs to be done, the rest of the time I'm stood in an awkward silence that makes me want to grab the nearest spatula and hit myself to change the focus of staring at the floor. The work I do in itself has little perks - if any. For 3 hours of my weekend i either have my had in the most disgusting 3 minute dishwasher in the world, this dishwasher actually has things growing in it, plates go in and come out twice as dirty, nicley infected with all sorts of exotic fungus that you know the customers wont be able to wait to feel the effects of - the next day, in bed, unable to move, throwing up for hours.  The rest of the joyful time i spend in the kitchen i'm either collecting chips or cutting potatoes to put into the all time favourite appliance of every spot on your face, the deep fat fryer. This kitchen appliance is so horrible i actually dream about it for the rest of the week, the dreams finally fading until i have to go back, which makes the nightmare all the more real. And what is worse is the baskets that hold the foods sucking in oil. Being of a weak dispostion (i begin to wonder sometimes if i have muscles in my arms) i find it difficult to lift them, but what makes things worse is that i have to turn them over afterwards. Chips everywhere but in the tray they are meant to be in. So after all that effort the process just has to be repeated again. I could continue, and I will. Another exciting activity is the microwave. I cannot get my head around it. Set times for different foods, which I press into the machine. So why when i take them out again is everything completely frazzeled, or stone cold? Is it me, am i a complete idiot, or does the microwave enjoy making my evenings that little more thrilling. Quite frankly, the rest of the kitchen has already done enough. The only perk i can think of is being payed. But is Â£4 and hour enough for this hell every week. Ah well, as is life I suppose, I have next weekend off!
