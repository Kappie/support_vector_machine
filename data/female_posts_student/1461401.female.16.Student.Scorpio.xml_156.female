We get to the football game, and we're looking for amber. And looking. And looking. And finally Mark finds her! Only, she's by the consesion stand and we're in the bleachers... So we had to wait till half time to run down and find her really quick. I ran to the fence by her and was screaming her name until she finally realized it was us. The best kind of hugs are the ones from friends who haven't seen you in a long time. So we hung out at third quarter and that was super fun. Then Anne came and we're all like IT'S ANNE! I didn't actually know she was coming to the game, so it was really cool that we got to see both Amber and Anne. Then, the most amazing thing happened. WE WON! THE FIRST (and probably only) GAME THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY WON! And since it's our homecoming game, it's so appropriate. Springfield must really really suck. So then we finally get back to the band room and I'm trying to change while everyone else is running around the band room with the tubas and the drummers are playing as loud as they could. Man, you don't know fun until you do The Brazillian in boxers on the balcony of the band room. So then we all (me, tracy, cassie, amber, ian, rob, and eventually alex) and we're all like So what are we going to do? So after about ten minutes of just standing around we decide to go to ians house, but amber had to take me home quick so I could change and alex decided to go with us. Then after that we had to go kidnap Mark, and I got to see his re-done bedroom which looks pretty good. Then we went and hung out in Ians garage with Rob and him singing and Alex throwing random objects and cassie and tracy doing what they do and me and amber and mark. Rob and Ian are really good. I don't think I can really stress that enough. They are really really good. After a while Tracy and Cassie had to leave so they left a little before 11, and they stole Mark. So then it was just me amber alex rob and ian hanging out and alex makes a really good pillow (I was tired) but then around 12 he had to go. Then around 12:30 Amber's like "Who's up for some waffles?" and so we go to waffle house. Heeheehee, good stuff. Then, while we were there, Karly and Anne came and we got to talk to them a bit and that was fun. Then we dropped Ian and Rob off and Amber came over so she could see my home coming dress and get her christmas present. I'm glad I got it for her, she really liked it. And then she left, and I woke up with three charley horses and a stiff neck (that's what you get for doing Special K to times in one night) (why is the head banging cadence called Special K?) but it was still soooooooo much fun. I'm glad Amber came back because I love her and I missed her and man I've been typing for a long time. *hand cramp* We'll have fun at home coming, so yay. (too bad Amber can't come to that though) Oh well, can't hog her the whole weekend. LOVE YA HUN! ~Kristin
