It could be very interesting. And there could be 5 of us. Just a thought. Tell me what you think!!  Also, Cassie: do you know any info about the musical we're doing for next year?? I heard that we might be doing "Brigadoon." Do you know anything about it??  Okay. Well here's one of those survey things. You guys can fill it out about me if you're bored enough! If not, I forgive you...for now! *evil grin* Also, you don't have to answer some of them if you don't want because some are brutally honest.   What Would You Do If..? I cried: I asked you to help: I died from natural causes: I said I liked you: I kissed you: I started smoking: I stole something: I was hospitalized: I ran away from home: I got in a fight and you were there: I got dumped: I pissed you off:  What Do You Think Of My..? Personality: Eyes: Face: Hair: Clothes: Voice: Humor: Choice of music: Mannerisms: Family: Body: Friends: Decisions:  Would You..? Be my friend: Tell me the truth no matter what: Lie to make me feel better: Spread rumors about me: Keep a secret if I told you one: Loan me some cash: Hold my hand: Take a bullet for me: Keep in touch: Try and solve my problems: Love me: Ditch me: Use me: Date me: Beat me up:
