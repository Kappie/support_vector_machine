And for a moment, I believed it... then I remembered where I said that, and it made everything worse again. It was as bad as I thought, but worse than I hoped. *sigh* At least I know what to do now.  I got my third and my final notecard checks today. I was so happy, for the rest of class I was doing irish jigs in my head. I swear.  We lost again tonight, 20-0, but it was still a really fun game. I sat inbetween alex and anne and that was fun because I actually had people to talk to. The senior show was so great, I absolutly loved it. I want to know where they got those sumo outfits! (and what happened with conquest?!?!) Then doug gave me a ride home for which I was very greatful because I wasn't wearing shoes. Now I'm sleepy, and I have prop room cleanup in the morning, so I'd better go to bed. Yes. That is how it works... so I'm told...
