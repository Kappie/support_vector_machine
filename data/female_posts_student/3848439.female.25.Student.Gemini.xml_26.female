I picked up the August 2004 issue of  urlLink Essence magazine  and one of the cover stories is "Do Black Men Still Want Us?"  Inside, there's an article entitled "Love Repair" with this as the first paragraph:  "The numbers are staggering: One in every five marriages will end within five years, and one in three will end within ten years, according to a 2001 report by the National Center for Health Statistics.  For Black women, the news is even more distressing.  We are less likely than White and Latina women to stay in our first marriages.  And if we remarry, those unions are also more likely than theirs to fail."  Now I've had an epiphany.  I need to stop reading these articles!  All they do is freak me out and terrify me.  This is not helpful.  Thankfully, the Love Repair article went on to give an account of the authors' (a married couple) experience in preventative marital counseling.  They went in okay and came out better.  Bully for them.  But I'm of that wonderful slant of mind that always says, "optimism for others, but pessimism for yourself."  Things will turn out great for everyone else, but I'm up the creek without a paddle.  So I've got to stop letting articles like this get me down.  I get scared and then I lose desire to act.  Perhaps I'll declare a little moratorium for myself - no new negative input on relationships is allowed to enter my head.  I can come up with a pessimistic view all by my self.
