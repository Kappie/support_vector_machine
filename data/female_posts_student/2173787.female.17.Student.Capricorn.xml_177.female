Because of religious restrictions the audience was entirely female, and it didn't seem to bother anyone at all.  I heard two of the most beautiful, comforting songs I have heard in a long time.  They weren't beautiful because of the singers, because some of the girls weren't great, but because of something deeper.  When I was just a small girl I heard the legend of the dove Like all the other animals  Hashem created it with love  But the dove was special For it was so pure and white Hashem sent it to the forest To turn the darkness into light  But all the animals were jealous And their hatred grew so strong They plotted ways to rid themselves Of the dove and its sweet songs  First the Tiger, then the Jaguar Then the Bear, Then the Snake When they'd attack, the dove would run And the dove barely escaped  So the dove turned to Hashem Tears streaming down his face I feel that I am alone With no one close to me  But then from under Hashem's throne Where He stores his precious things He gave the dove a special gift He gave the Dove his wings  And He said higher and higher Higher than the sky Higher and higher Its as high as you can fly You'll fly up to the heavens Even higher than you dream Higher and higher You'll fly close to me  The dove went to the forest With confidence and pride He'd never have to run again And he's never have to hide  He would always be protected And now that he had wings He would sit in a treetop And the world would hear him sing  But all the animals were furious When they saw the dove's new wings It was as if Hashem was telling them That the dove would be their king  So they pounced upon the dove And he could barely fly They left him torn and wounded They left him there to die  So the dove turned to Hashem And he cried it isn't fair These precious wings you gave to me That I always have to wear  They are so very heavy Much more than I can bear Please take me from the forest I cannot take it here  And Hashem turned to the dove My child please understand Now I have given you these wings Your destiny is in your hands  If you use your wings for flying They'll never weigh you down And you'll fly much higher Than those who live upon the ground  And you'll go higher and higher Higher than the sky Higher and higher Its as high as you can fly You'll fly up to the heavens Even higher than you dream Higher and higher You'll fly close to me  The dove returned back to the forest And now the others lay in wait They'd attack in unison And this time death would be his fate  But the dove was so determined And he began to fly And like Hashem had promised him He soared up to the sky  And he went higher and higher Higher than the sky Higher and higher Its as high as you can fly You'll fly up to the heavens Even higher than you dream Higher and higher You'll fly close to me  Our story has concluded But friends there's one more thing The little dove that's you and me And the Torah is our wings  You'll fly up to the heavens Even higher than you dream Higher and higher  You'll fly close to me - Higher and Higher      Mother please tell me Help me understand Who made what surrounds us The sky and the land  The water we drink The air that we breathe Mother please tell me  What should I believe?  Listen my child Put your trust in me There is a creator that man cannot see And we owe our existence To no one but him Beraishis Barah Elokim ( G-d created the world )  Its not just a story A tale that's been told A fable, a myth, or a legend of old  It's not someone's fantasy, theory or whim It's what I believe Ani Maamin  Mother please tell me I'm asking of you Why am I different What makes me a Jew  How am I to know The right life to lead Mother please tell me What am I to believe  Listen My child  I was long, long ago When we stood by a mountain One nation one soul And what we received Is our very life's blood Naaseh V'nishmah Amru K'echad (  We will do and we will hear, they said as one )  Its not just a story A tale that's been told A fable, a myth, or a legend of old  It's not someone's fantasy, theory, or whim It's what I believe Ani Maamin  Mother please tell me  What does G-d intend Will this long bitter exile soon come to an end Or must we continue to grieve Mother please tell me What I believe?  Listen my child  The future will bring A day when the world knows who's King of all kings Today or tomorrow I don't need to know Achakeh Lo B'chol Yom Sheyavo ( I await his coming every day ) - Mother Please Tell Me   The concert was absolutely beautiful.  It was at someone's home and the acoustics weren't great, but none of that mattered.  Every single one of the girls got a solo and if one stumbled the others, or the audience, would help her along.  They knew all the songs by heart and stood proud and tall at the microphone.  Their shyness and insecurities, which I know they have, dropped away before the women of their community, they were just part of the whole.  It was amazing to be a part of that.  Leah, Helana, Leiba, Kaila and Chaya sang a few songs together.  The first two are the Rabbis Herman's wives, the middle is Rabbi Pinney's daughter and the last two are teachers at hillel.  I sat there watching these five beautiful women sing their hearts out in front of everyone and was jealous.  I have never felt jealousy so strongly before.  The women standing before me were talented and loved, they had a place securely in the community and are totally confident in themselves.  Their belief is so strong that they can face the world, different from the rest.  While they were singing I forgot who they were, what they were.  They weren't five orthodox women, some fanatics or pious saints, but simply people.  Leiba wasn't Rabbi's oldest about to leave for seminary.  Helana and Leah weren't rebetzins.  Watching them share their gifts with the community to which they belonged did make me jealous.  I was more jealous than I have ever been before,  I wanted that more than I've wanted anything before.  It shocked me to realize it, that I wanted to be one of those girls singing in the choir, that I wanted to go back and have that memory in my past, to know that I could stand before a group of people without fear and sing, even though I might fail.  To know that if I failed, someone would be there to help me move on.  Now that I have this knowledge of what I want, I don't know what to do. My life would be so different, if I followed that path.
