We ate and saw kirby, tittle, kevin, luke, lauren j., JP, and ben.  We were singing karoake and having a big time....I got home that night at about 10:30.  Friday night I had the band banquet which was as always quite boring.  After that, me and Lacretia went to the my house to change clothes.  We went to the square and met up with Stacey, Chelsea, Duhbresse, and this other girl I didn't know!  at about 12 we went to Old Mexico and partied.  It was SOO much fun.  College guys all over the place, this girl dancing all over the place! and then there was John John...lmao.....my boy!! lol! bless it....I cant really share much more about last night...its all history now! lmao...hopefully! We took John John home around 3 and then we went home and "crashed"! hah! I wanna go to trog feast tonight to see everybody that wants me to go, but I doubt mom will let me b/c I was out till all hours of the mornin this morning!!! Im sick as a dog, and I cant be sick b/c mom will know something's up if Im sick...Im tired as hell and I cant go get in the bed which sucks too.  Im about to go help daddy do something outside so I might be able to go to Trog Fest! Ill talk to yall later! leave a comment! lol  Nothing Maybe I like giving smiles which seems to be a sin today, and maybe I allow my imagination to sometimes run away, maybe you don't understand this and that's why you cannot see, if this make me nothing  hey, that's ok with me!  The world makes you believe your personality mustn't be detected, your face must be picture perfect and wear cloths just to be accepted. Maybe I look at you and feel sorry that you're blind, robots you have became, yourself you'll never find.
