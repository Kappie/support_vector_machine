XP).  but, it makes for good money... not that the chances of me getting any money are very high, virtually none if you asked me...  hm... fiction, children's story, humorous peice/personal essay, or poetry? *groans*   i think i'll go sulk.    my 'cleaness' is starting to get to me. cleaning dust like mad, though not litteraly cleaning up per say. dust is one thing, actually moving all my crap is another.   *dramatically* WHY O, WHY IS GOD TORTURING ME SO!  yep, summer's like that. sleeping in, sitting around, stuffing my face, CLEANING... it's an endless, thought not very productive, cycle.   am i just bored? or boring? pathetic, isn't it. i am so incredibly pathetic.
