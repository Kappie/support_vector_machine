Its a riveting 1/4 mile walk to the place of the ceremony and one has to stand during the entire ceremony.  Boy do I love this half of the family too.  To give you an idea they've lived on the east coast most of their lives and my cousins went to Duke.  They aren't really California savvy.  And now I get to meet all of their other relations. yay.  Well, I will be back sometime Monday, and we can get back to our humping.  For now, this has been Carlie, signing off.
