Well, I have to go, but before I do, this is what I have stuck in my head.  Franz Ferdinand: Take Me Out  So if you're lonely You know I'm here waiting for you I'm just a crosshair I'm just a shot away from you.  And if you leave here You leave me broken, shattered, I lie I'm just a crosshair I'm just a shot, then we can die.  Maybe I shouldn't have listened to it before I went to bed. I had a dream about crosshairs.
