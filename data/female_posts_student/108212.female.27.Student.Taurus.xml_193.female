Speaking of (Middle class) - DVD players are under $100 now, so we bought one, and a few rewatchables we didn't already have:  Caddyshack, Music Man, North by Northwest, Round Midnight, My Fair Lady, Raging Bull .  Rented a couple DVDs too - LOVED(!!!)  O Brother Where Art Thou?   Great  Ulysses  references - sirens, Cyclops, the wife who's going to remarry.  I always liked the Coen Bros., but this was even better than I hoped.  Helps I'm a bluegrass fan too.  And  The Mexican .  Pretty cool plot twists, and some pretty dark humor.  More blood than I like (I like NONE,  Raging Bull  notwithstanding).  Julia Roberts was a little over-the-top with her psychobabble, but I'm sure there are girls out there just like her.  Daf
