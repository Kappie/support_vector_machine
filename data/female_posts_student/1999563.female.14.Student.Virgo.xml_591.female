At lunch Emily and I walked around in Junior High hall and said high to Mrs. Payne, she is sooo cool! She was like "Wanna teach history?" and we were like "YESSS" but then she changed her mind.Haha.  After school I had to play for mr. albers and I did super bad but he gave me a A anyways. Hahha.  Thats all I can think to sayyyy.
