To sit and watch young children sitting on the dirt floor saying "We don't have a good life.  Our life is terrible" and know that I have every material possession I could possibly want right now.  To sit there and watch children crying because they don't have a mother anymore and their father is dying for the same reason.  Listening to them talk about how they have no money in a one room hut while trying to light a fire.  It makes me feel selfish.  People shouldn't have to live like that,  children  shouldn't have to live like that.
