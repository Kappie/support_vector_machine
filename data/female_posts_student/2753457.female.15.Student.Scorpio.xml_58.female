I was coming up with names for characters for something I started working on. If I had ten kids, that's what their names would be. Well, I guess I probably wouldn't name my son Cassius. Or my daughter Persephone. But the names are still cool. Can you tell how bored I've been? Hahaha, I'm working in my mommy's office answering the telephone. "Good afternoon, Joslin,Sedberry and Lamkin." I was trying to find a dumb blog survey to do. May end up doing one of those. Ahh, here we go.      Name:  Who do you think?       Been in love:  Not really.       done drugs:  Not seriously.       Eaten an entire box of oreos:  Ew, no.       Been on stage:  Yes.       Dyed your hair:  Do it all the time.       Gone to school in your pajamas:  Yes.       Gotten a detention:  Haha, I got lunch detention from Mr. Lucas in seventh grade once. Man, that guy was a DUMB ASS.       Loved someone so much that it made you cry:  Mmm, yeah. Not romantically though.     ( THIS // THAT )  Cold / hot:  Cold.     Blue / red:  I like all the colors!      Rain / snow:  Well, I like both, but I really love thunderstorms the most.       Give / receive:  Must I pick? I like all this stuff.       Wool / cotton:  I’d have to say cotton.       Private school / public school:  Public.       Chocolate milk / plain milk:  Hmm, well, I guess plain. Chocolate milk kinda freaks me out. But seriously, cow milk is actually for baby cows.       Celsius / fahrenheit:  Even though it takes me a minute to figure Celsius out, the metric system always makes more sense and the standard system is crap. Another reason why America is a weird fucking place.       Spring / fall:  Both.       History / science:  History, usually.       Math / english:  I guess English. I love algebra though.       Country / rock:  Unless it’s rugged old bluegrass, definitely rock. Good rock, mind you.       Coke / pepsi:  Coke for life.       Cherry coke / vanilla coke:  Neither. Erlack.       Sprite / 7up:  Sprite, I guess.       Love / lust:  A lot of both works for me.       Sleep / eat:  Sleep, definitely.     ( FRIENDS )  Who do you see most often:  It’s hard to tell in the summer.I try to see everyone fairly often. I think the person I’ve seen most lately is Mary Alice.      Who is your most annoying friend:  Do I have to say it?       Who do you e-mail the most:  I really don’t use email, but I guess probably my piano teacher, as sad as that sounds.       Who`s the loudest:  I don’t know. I’m pretty loud myself. Especially with headphones on.       Who`s the shyest:  Well, Joncie was pretty shy when we were growing up, but I don’t think I’d call her shy now.       Who has the best room:  I love all your rooms. I love other people’s houses.       Who`s the most horny:  We’re all REALLY horny, and a few of us aren’t afraid to say it. Come, on. I think you know my theory.       Who do you trust the most:  Among the Enloe kids, I think I’d have to say Sarah. She’s a good listener, which is a hard job. But I trust Mary Alice and the beach girls a lot too. I have more issues trusting guys.       Who`s your best friend:  Don’t have one. Or all my friends are. Either way you look at it.       Favorite friends of the same sex:  I don’t think I can choose.There are a lot of girls my age who I don't like that much, but I’m quite fond of some girls.

Fought with a friend : Well, not a fight, per se. I was pretty angry yesterday though.       Cried : You want to hear something sad? Yesterday I went to see The King and I, a show I don’t even really like. And I almost cried part of the way through. Wow.       Felt empty : I’m quite familiar with the feeling.     ( DO YOU LIKE TO )  Give hugs : Oh, yes.      Give back rubs : No. Too much work.       Take walks in the rain : Yeah, my mom has to like drag me inside to keep me from getting sick.       Watch tv : Not that much lately. Mostly just silly episodes of I Love the 90s.       Do homework : Actually it really depends on what it is. Usually not, though.       Play in the snow : With other people or the dogs. It’s not fun by yourself. I just find that it’s really really cold.       Stay up all night talking to friends : Oh, yeah. That can be fun with a fun person.       Work out : I live to work out. Live for it.       Talk on the phone : Depends on who it is. I like a nice marathon chat. I’ve conquered my phobia!       Go online : Yes.       Kiss : *smiles*       Do freaky things : What the hell is that supposed to mean? Whoever wrote this thing (some ten-year-old) was really trying hard to be cool.

Ran a marathon:  No.       Met a famous person:  Yeah, but no one awesome.       Bought something and then sold it : I think I have done that. Oh, that reminds me of a story from when I was like three or four. My mom gave my stuffed pig Hilda away before realizing that I still loved the thing. So she had to buy it back.I guess that's really the other way around.       Gotten drunk:  Not obscenely drunk.       Smoked:  No.       Stalked someone:  No.     ( LOVE )  Single or taken:  Single.      If u were gonna go out with anyone who would it be:  Well, probably someone really annoying and dumb. Yep.
