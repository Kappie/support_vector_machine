And then she won't answer questions on hw or anything.  argh.  Sports update: Dallas tied 4-4 last night with NY Islanders.  Brilliant game, i got up early this morning and watched the highlights on NHL.com.  The goal that made us tie by Bill Guerin with 6.2 secs left in the regulation....absolutely brilliant.  Coppell beat Flower Mound 4-1, awesome game.  I also went to the Lariette show thing and the dancing was sooooo awesome!!!  Brittnee McCutchin (one of my best friends!!!) did her solo and she was sooooooo good!!!!  I was so proud of her!!  Her dress was beautiful and her dance was great.  Sarah Gautille, captain of the Lariettes, was also awesome.  It'll be a sad day when she graduates and leaves the Lariettes.  She's the one that brings it all together.    I won an award today from Liz Whiting!!!!!!  I was the recipient of the great "Finland and Hockey Award", lol.  I made an "acceptance speech" and everything.  THANK YOU LIZ FOR THE AWARD!!!!!

Britty and Jess come over, 4. Watch Stars game, 5. watch hockey movies  Sunday:  1. church (blech! i don't want to go, i'll be tired!), 2. rest/hw  And for the 5th year in a row, Valentine's Day will suck......oh well, i'll live just like i did last year and the year before that and the year before....  Go Date-less and Boyfriend-less people!!!!  Represent!!!!  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~
