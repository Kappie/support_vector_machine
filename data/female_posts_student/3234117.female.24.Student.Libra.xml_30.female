In fact, do some searching and you may be able to find it.  Don't look too hard, it's not that great.  Basically I created this page so everyone can know what's going on in my life because I know you all want to know.  Plus, you know I just didn't feel as special not having my own site.  So here it is.  Hope you enjoy!
