(it was with you all in mind!)  until i come up with a good name for my web site, i am stymied.  any suggestions?  i have to  buy  a domain name and i want it to be a good one, that isn't already taken.   last night i sat staring at my monitor until the wee hours of the morning,  coming up with all this amusing stuff you might like.  to drunk to type, (well)  i forgot it all.  it seem that i am equally blessed with writing ability-  as i am cursed with poor memory.  so be it.   lately i have been putting pressure on myself to write more.  as a result i am suffering from writer's block.   i suppose that some things in life,  typically those that make the most interesting topics-  are the most difficult to share.   every one has the friends that are  listeners..   the people that you tell everything to.  i have a few. one for each topic:  one to bitch about men with,  one to bitch about women with,  one to bitch about work with,  one to gossip with,  one to talk about books with,  one to discuss depression with, and  there is always the "kiss and tell" friend, of course.  the problem is that two of my "listeners" are locked up right now.  i have no outlet, and less imput.  i can, and have, written letters, and i like letters, but they are so-  automatic, i guess.  "hi, how are you? i am fine. i am doing this and i did this and so and so went here,  love, incognito."  very one-sided.  this blog is not dissimilar, but i canread comments from those who care to join my solo conversation.  (poor dears..)  (kidding!)   i think what i need to do is carry around my legal pads more, and just write down what strikes me, however inconvienent:  me:"hi! welcome to So  So's what can i get for you to drink? oh wait just a sec....  ( scribble scribble )   sorry, was that a guiness and,..... and a what  now?  ( more frantic writing... )   hi, welcome to so 's......."    i can see my tips swirling down the drain.  i work with a girl like this, who has too many thoughts in her brain to focus on, well, pretty much anything.  sometimes i wonder exactly what has taken up so much attention that she forgets so much, and so often.  maybe she is on a 7 sec.delay, and the instant she begins a new task, she remembers the old one.  this kind of thing is usually indicative of a person who absorbs much more than you or i,  but absorbing doesn't neccesarily mean retaining.  i hopeADHD isn't contagious,  because i have been experiencing some symptoms.....   (as if you couldn't tell)
