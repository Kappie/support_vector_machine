The concert went really well; the band played its best ever, and senior choir did really well too (though not as well as I thought we did in Boston). Didn't talk to Frodo as much as I hoped I would, but ya know. Whatever works, ne? Played a game of jackass, lost, didn't play again ^^; Watched the jazz band, and they were fantastic. The Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy was just brilliant. I would have rathered they didn't turn up M's mic, just because I wanted to hear the harmonies more, but it was still just amazing.   2. Wonderland on Saturday. Practically no one showed up (which I predicted), and the line-ups were horrible and it was the frikkin Ice Age out there. Nonetheless, I had fun ^^; Hope K knew what her present was (they were bath bombs!!). lol, I went on 3 rides in 4 hours. A and I just hung out and danced in front of the Lazer Tag building... aw man, we should do  that  for someone's b-day! I love Lazer Tag!! There was also a cute guy with a checkered shirt, and his blue, blue-eyed friend was even cuter, but I didn't talk to them. I did wave though ^^; A and I also didn't get a chance to go on the new ride, the Tomb-Raider... by the time we realized we'd better get to it, since we had to leave in a half-hour, we also realized that the line-up would be waaay too long. But that's ok. We can go later, after exams.   3. Finished pretty much all my homework, which kicks asssss, man. Just gotta do the civics essay, get a few more items for my trunk, and I'm  done . Wee! Freedom!   4. I saw  Snatch  and  Timeline  over the weekend.  Timeline  was, as expected, reasonably crappy but with neat-o costumes and accents. Claire and Meuric made the movie, if there even was one. But   Snatch  ! Omigod! My sister was a sheer genius for making me watch it. It was brilliantly fantabulous! It was the craziest and most original filming I've ever seen, and the plot was just insane. I love-love-love-LOVED it. I honestly recommend it to everyone. Especially those who a) love action-packed violence, b) love mad-complicated plots and twists, and c) think Brad Pitt is cute! It was just genius, I tell you! Sheer and utter and impossible    GENIUS   !!! I'm in love, guys.  Snatch  is My New Favourite Movie of All Time.   5. New template. It's a bit different from the one I downloaded, but close enough. Used to be called "Alter Ego", but... isn't it pretty? And eventually I'll get rid of that little stripey remainder of the advertisement. lol, the way I got rid of most of it was by making a blank image in Paint and just sticking it in... now that part is just being ornery. Grr. I am the only person/thing/being allowed to be ornery!!   So that's it, mostly. Figured I needed a big update, to make up for the lack of them the past few days. I've been in a bit of a funk (it happens), but I'm okay now. Hopefully Frodo will start talking to me, too. If he doesn't I'll be mad. And probably stalk someone else and leave him for T. Who, by the way, is hilariously funny. Her life should be made into a movie (who the hell tells the guy's sister that...) *sigh* Nevermind. Just... yeah. heehehehehee...
