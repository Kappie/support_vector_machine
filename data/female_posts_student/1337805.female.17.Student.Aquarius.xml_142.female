Plus if you started this up, there's like, 800 little error messages before you start it up. Sorry about that folks..:( I had comments, just don't know where they went. Heh. When I find them I'll make sure you guys all know. Something's wrong with the code, I'll have to check out Haloscan either today or tomorw and find out. Until then, hearts, stars and horseshoes.
