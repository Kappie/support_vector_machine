(tie) Michigan, Penn  9. Virginia  10 (tie) Northwestern, Duke   how do they rank these things? who knows? who cares! i am content. kinda...  other updates:  i watched an 11-disc  dorama  {japanese drama} over the weekend called "Beautiful Life." i had some trouble reading the chinese subtitles, but i understood it well enough to cry me a river through the last three episodes. i have not left the house since sunday on account of my goldfish eyes.  The leading role is played by Takuya Kimura, a member of the jpop band called Smap that i absolutely adore. Kimutaku, for short, may not look like much in the pix below, but let me assure you, in the movie, he was oh-so-flyyyyy:     some ppl claim that my taste in men has taken a dangerous turn in recent weeks towards the uber-fobby, from regular-fobby. i just don't see it. it's still regular-fobby to me.  sometimes, i wonder if i'm so openly ethnocentric that ppl know exactly what to say to turn me off to an idea. observe  Exhibit 1A   (*awesome display of lawyer-like qualities*) - "Conversation with Anonymous Friend":  Octoberprl: PHILIP PHILIP! guess what?? Anonymous Friend: wha? Octoberprl: i made it into ______(law school)! Anonymous Friend: ... Anonymous Friend: it's cold there Anonymous Friend: and there's a lotta white ppl Anonymous Friend: if you're into that sorta thing...  maybe this is a sign that it's high time i thrust myself smack-dab in the center of america-land. i feel like i've been having trouble communicating these days, forming complete adult-standard sentences out of words. granted, i encounter extreme linguistic difficulties when talking to a crush, but these days, i go around talking like that to everyone. it's very troubling. i could blame it on my williamhung obsession, but i think somebody just needs to pry the remote out of my hand and replace it with a book. according to the Oprah's Book Club newsletters via email, i'm desperately behind in One Hundred Years of Solitude. as you may recall, i had listed that book back in January as one that i'd already completed. well, that was a little beige lie...i now confess to you that the only book i've finished this year, the year of the ALMIGHTY MONKEY, is Confessions of a Shopaholic. that's pretty pitiful if you ask me.  the next book that i want to read, after 100 Years and Fast Food Nation (unfinished from 2002) and Guns Germs and Steel (2001), is A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers. I've heard such raving reviews of the man that it's about time I acquaint myself with him personally.   hey y'all, i think i have a zit on my tonsils, if that's possible. since it's beyond popping range, i guess i just hafta put up with this gaw-awful case of halitosis a while longer...  btw, does anyone know the html for uploading pictures onto blogger? the code that i've been using so far only allows me to link internet images. my overwhelming desire to share myself with the world has been thwarted many-a-times due to this inconvenience. input from anyone would be greatly appreciated. thanks sabin.  p.s.
