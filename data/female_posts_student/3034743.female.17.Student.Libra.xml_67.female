I don't know why I am so excited about that....considering I told him I didn't know. Why did I have to do that? He may not even call!  So, oh well.  I just don't know why I am always scared to do stuff with guys. I totally shouldn't be. Girls my age are supposed to go out with guys and have fun, not just stay home. I'm such a loser. Oh well. I know that eventually I'll do stuff. This weekend shouldnt be too eventful. I'll just be stuck at home doing nothing, as always. I'm listening to this song called Honey and The Moon, and for some reason, it really put me into a deep-thinking kind of mood. It made me a little sad too. I don't know. I just feel that I'm incapable of making the right decisions sometime. But then other times I totally feel that I made the right choice and have no regrets. I really don't even know what I am trying to get at right now. Swedish Fish are good....right, Chubbs? Speaking of Chubbs...I haven't really talked to her too much these past few days. Hmm.. Oh well. I'll blog later.
