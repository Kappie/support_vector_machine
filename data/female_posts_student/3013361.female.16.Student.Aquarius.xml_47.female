You know when you like someone and all you can see is how great they are, how they seem to say all the right things and all that crap. Well, grow up because you're being stupid. No one is perfect and if you think someone is, chances are they're going to do something to really tick you off. It happened to me and now I'm seeing all the other flaws they've always had but I was too lovestruck to see. Don't ever be like that.
