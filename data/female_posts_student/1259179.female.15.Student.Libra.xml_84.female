The  urlLink  ~ Spa Sur Le Lac ~  was so amazing.  We started on Saturday with some. urlLink  ~ Reflexology ~  and than some nap-time, because THAT is soooo tiring.. and in the evening we go dressed up and went for a YUMMY diner with Champagne.  After a great night sleep, an afternoon of more treats for our body's.  We basically didn't want to come back.  Mom  I always have a great time together.  I am so fortunate to have my Best Friend in my mom.  Again, we laughed so much that my insides hurt.  I will tell you a little secret, no one in the dining room was having as much fun as we were...   After a beautiful weekend, came back to my "Petite Famille".  I did miss them..  So now back to work and still feeling the after math of a great weekend.  Have a sunny filled day and.........Be Good
