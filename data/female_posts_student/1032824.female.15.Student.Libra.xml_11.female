(im a net geek) - telly time - dinner -  more  telly  - slack and unwind - read (magazines  only !) - nitey mates   Yesterday was mucho productive though. i went ta daddy's club for a swim. not forgetting, i caught  the hulk  with a coupla' seniors. it was an average movie.  I seriously gotta do something about this. sucks big time yo. this will prolly be my last entry ever cos' i will no longer be alive after this night. my parents are going to chop off my head and eat it for supper because i have yet to complete my holiday assignments and i am addicted to the frickin web design programme on my puter.  fuckkkkkkkk . Oh well life wasnt that fun anyways.. everyone who reads this is invited to my funeral. i hope you miss me. TOODLES!!
