Why can't it be next weekend, then I wouldn't have to worry about this dumb ass Junior Career Project.  It should die, die and go to hell.  I hope you guys have fun this weekend.  I'll be in beautiful Lemore .  For thoes of you guys that don't know where that wonderful  deffinatley  cowless town is, its about 1/2 way to LA.  If you know where Harris Ranch is, its 30 miles past that.  SIgh.  If I come back smelling like cows, its not my fault.  And friday is Marissa's 18th B-day!  Yay! Happy b-day, which is why I can't go out with you guys.  (Speaking of harris ranch, marissa wants to go to dinner at Stuart Andersons so if any of you guys want to pop in or something...) Yeah, well, so cheer on my team, if we get far I'll probably be in some far off town next weekent to. I hope not cause thats when Aimee and Marissa are having a joint birthday party, a mi casa, AND YOU ARE ALL INVITIED!!!  The only requirement is that you have to buy them both presents.  So, i am not sure on the time but there will be hella food and hella people,so come on down!
