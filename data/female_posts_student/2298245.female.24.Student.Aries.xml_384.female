The Bush team still employs high-minded rhetoric about America's democratic mission abroad, but, in practice, it has reverted to a more humble focus. The Kerry campaign, too, has abandoned any pretense of democratic idealism. Strategic chokepoints, oil wells, alliances--these are the things that animate Kerry's "realistic" vision of the world. Which is too bad. Because, no matter what you think of Iraq, realism can't win the war on terrorism.   He then goes on to confirm my worst fears about what a Kerry Presidency might mean for the war on terrorism:   In April, Kerry said the goal in the present war should be "a stable Iraq, not whether or not [Iraq] is a full democracy."    This is almost nothing in and of itself, except a poorly worded (or I guess well-worded, depending on whether Kerry was going for clarity or not) statement.  Of course full democracy is not the goal, as there is not a full democracy - reading "full" to mean "pure" - anywhere in the world that I know of.  Some republican influences on the democratic form are to be expected.  But Kaplan goes on:   When it comes to Egypt, Kerry said in a recent interview, democracy promotion would have to take a backseat to "general stability in the Middle East." In China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Pakistan, too, "Kerry indicated that as president he would play down the promotion of democracy," according to the Post. After all, Kerry said, in an echo of Jeane Kirkpatrick's famous argument that the United States shouldn't push too hard to democratize "friendly" dictatorships, "You have to put your priorities first."    In all fairness to Kerry, I'm not sure that Bush currently plans to pursue a goal of bringing democracy to the world, one government at a time.  Or if that is his goal, he has not been the best at articulating it or making it the forefront of his justifications for war.  But after reading this article, I can't help but think that this is understandable, since apparently "talking the talk" is not very politically acceptable right now.  I'd give a slight edge to Bush, as he is at least somewhat committed to "walking the walk" in a way that Kerry has not shown thus far.  Continuing:   Yet, when approached by democracy and human rights advocates about having Kerry devote an address to the subject during his recent series of speeches on national security, the campaign declined. Asked to explain the lack of any references to the topic in Kerry's recent addresses, one adviser says, "He doesn't want to sound too 'soft,' and, my guess is, he doesn't feel passionately about it."    Is Kerry so out of touch that he thinks talking about supporting democracy, and advocating bringing it to the rest of the world, makes him sound too  soft ?  I guess  urlLink we have different ideas of what makes a Presidential candidate look soft .  To be fair, yet again, Kaplan doesn't provide much reason for us to be optimistic of Bush's motives either:   Trouble is, the very realists whom Bush decries are now running his foreign policy. The Pentagon's neoconservative democratizers have been losing influence for months now. The nadir came three weeks ago, when the National Security Council (NSC) signed off on a raid on the home of former Pentagon favorite Ahmed Chalabi--without informing the Pentagon beforehand. The neoconservatives' decline was already apparent last October, when, in an attempt to centralize Iraq policy at the NSC, Condoleezza Rice formed the Iraq Stabilization Group--again, without consulting the Pentagon. The official chosen to chair the group, Rice's boss in the first Bush administration, Robert Blackwill, has "reduced the Defense Department's influence to zero," says a senior administration official.   But this piece is not about advocacy of a candidate, but about advocacy of an idea:   But the United States is entitled--on September 11, the aim of a democratic Middle East became a matter of our national well-being, even survival. And the United States is obligated--because either pressure for democracy in the Arab world will come from the United States or it will come from nowhere at all.    And the oh-so-right conclusion:   To be sure, with Iraqis killing Americans every day, the temptation to yield to such pessimism may prove irresistible. But, when they advertise Iraq--like they advertised Vietnam before it--as the repudiation of a larger democratic war of ideas, the realists encourage a more pessimistic conclusion than circumstances justify. A policy can be measured by its successes, and it can be measured by its failures. When it comes to America's record in promoting democratic change, the former surely outweigh the latter. The world may not change easily, but, because of America, it has changed. Having come so far, and confronted with a new totalitarian threat, how "realistic" would it be to quit now?    I think this is a must read for all.  Really, go and check the whole thing out, especially if you are like me and need a little bucking up every now and again.  I start to think that I am crazy to feel the way I do - and then I read something like this by someone far more knowledgable and brilliant than I and realize that I am not.  Or at the very least, I am in very good company.
