Vin Diesel is a horrible actor, but that line was fantastic in that movie.  Life screws everybody; I'm sort of a nihilist, so I have a belief that the basis of life is simply having problems. The second part of that, however, the non-nihilist half, says that life is also about dealing with and overcoming problems. Yes, it took me about...eight months now to formulate that belief, and a lot of emotional detailing and rearrangement and stuff, but it seems to be working very well for me.  Love is the last thing left? Tell that to the people  burning in hell . Muhahahahaha.  O yeah B-wood hoods, today on the bus, Brittany called Lizzie back and left a heathenistic message, imitating me. God, that girl. Thereafter, I call'd her and left a message. And then the shit hit the fan. I gave my cousin Seth Lizzie's number, whereafter he called and left a message confessing his undying love to her. Then she called me and asked if it was I who had left that message, I said no, she said, "OK, bye, sorry," Then, Seth managed to get the number from me via stealing my cell and taking the number off of it; he then left several messages asking her to get married, and eventually breaking up with her. Once he called the wrong number and asked some random lady out, via voicemail. He left his number on that one, and after it was over, I told him, "Dude, you just left your number," He just stared at me for a moment, and then called Lizzie back.  Uhoh, she was getting pissed after these, say, eight messages. She called my grandmother's and Seth answered. He started asking her questions, and someone Seth got our of her that  Leigh Anne was getting her to call me and leave these messages . So with a look of mild shock on my face, I tried to take the phone, listening in on Seth trying to get her to talk to me:  "So do you wanna talk to Josh?" "No," "Why?" "Because he's an asshole!"  Oops, everyone hates me. I picked up the next time she called and, while Seth was busy pledging his love to/breaking up with Lizzie, I was asking her how she got my number; through Leigh, who was asking her to leave messages.  I don't think she'll leave anymore though. She's getting really screwed up over Seth calling a thousand times.  Silly smart people at MLK, all full of themselves.
