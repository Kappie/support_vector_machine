And tomorrow we get yearbooks, and yeah i hate signing them.  its so i dunno final? and even tho its not cause we're all gonna be back next year i know i'll forget most of this year and i shouldnt.  so the yearbook is how we all remember the little retarded things, so i dunno pressure?  haha i stress about yearbooks.  this year owns all over last year.     k thanks.     there was a bit, but for the most part so much less drama.  i'm learning to live with everything, i'm off of wheat, i'm off of yeah, i'm off of talking about things that bother me and hopefully others are off of feeling sorry for me.   i liked going to nyc, i liked hanging out at tina's (driving there too, even though short pump traffic is full of bastads)  i liked becoming increadibly close with chelsea, i missed some people who i used to talk to, too.  i liked that i could drive.  i feel independant even though my keys are currently taken from me.   i feel like my own person.  i liked key club, i liked prom.  i loved prom.  i feel bad that this summer   i'm going away, and yet i'm so excited about italy. its going so well now, i just dont want it to end, or get messed up over the summer.  i dont want junior year to end.  we're going to be seniors! old! our very last year of high school. of living at home.  our last homecomming, last prom, last chance to do whatever the fuck we want to do in high school.  and i plan on doing just that.  while keeping my grades up.   im such a governor's schooler.  i was like maybe, jackie, if you are so nervous about writing exactly what you need to in peoples yearbooks, why dont you try writing it down ahead of time, you dork?  man i cant even do that.  have a great summer.  love ya.  we should hang out.  (meaning we wont)  call me (meaning you wont)  and i love you (which i honestly do)
