I have determined that these two books are but different translations of the same book writen by Aristotle.  However i must express my concern over the quote log.  if we are to keep a quote log on a nonstandard book how do we know if the quote I say is the same as the one you say?  don't worry the book you seek is a book by aristotle with "Rhetoric" in the titile somewhere.  I myself have "The Art of Rhetoric".  and i concur with Z -- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
