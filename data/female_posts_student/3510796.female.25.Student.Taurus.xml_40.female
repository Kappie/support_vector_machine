Tomorrow night either.  I suck.  Anyway, this is my post for today, and I wont be around for a few days.  Try not to miss my exciting adventures.  Just know I will be having fun without you!     Is DMB a chick or guy band?      The reason I think it may appeal to more woman than men as someone previously mentioned (51% to 49%) is that the members of DMB seem to hold their female fanbase in a higher regard than other rock bands.  Meaning that they don't treat them like sex objects or as a butt of jokes.  There don't seem to be many DMB "groupies" in the traditional sense of the word. Maybe this has something to do with it.  --Beatlesfan    -post on  urlLink nancies.    51% women and 49% men.  Lucky guys.  Gotta eat. Gotta run. Gotta live.   Peace.Love.DMB.
