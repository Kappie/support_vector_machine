Yesterday me, Spinks, and Alex were wrapping gifts at Border's for Habitat...that was really fun! The people were really nice, at least, they gave us really good advice on how to wrap stuff without giving us shit on how lousy we were doing. And even if they had, I would have just reminded them how much they were paying for it, and they could just take their shit and leave. It's not like we needed the dollar bills everyone was giving anyway. People are so damned cheap. But we made enough money so it was all good. It also reinforced the fact that I'm probably never going to hold a job if my life depends on it.   Oh, and one last thing, because it's troubling me.  I can't go into my room.  Yes, I know that's probably the weirdest thing you've heard all week. Supposedly, my dad bought me something for Christmas while we were in Chattanooga, and my grandmother and grandfather down there brought it up this weekend. Anyway, it's presently sitting in front of my door, in the middle of the floor...I've been told that it once breathed, but it doesn't anymore...I asked Katie if I could bring it back to life and she said no, but it would be funny if I tried. What the hell is it? And I can't go into my room! Grr! That means no getting dressed, no playing guitar/drums, no PS2, no...sleeping really. I've got the couch, and then the dogs are going to decide it would be fun to have a slumber party to their maximum comfort.  I'm scared. I don't like dead things in my room, or that I don't get to go inside until Christmas day in the morning. Or that my dad's making me leave for Chattanooga right after we get done opening presents. What kind of shit is that?!? He said we might not go. I hope he decides to "not have any feelings" like he says he does and keep us here. He said that he might not simply because he wants to "help me...play with...the thing in your room."  I hate Christmas. It's so commercial.  /Brrr.
