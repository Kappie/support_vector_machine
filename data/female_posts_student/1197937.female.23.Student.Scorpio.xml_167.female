How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!  The world forgetting, by the world forgot Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!  Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.   i think this is one of the few movies that i could watch over and over again. and as for the other stuff, had i known the ending, i'd still have started them, in a heartbeat.
