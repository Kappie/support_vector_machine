So I'm thinking I'll try  urlLink the hot roller method  next time I actually do my hair. I must admit, most mornings I just flip my head over, work a little smoothing cream in (from back to front, concentrating on the ends), then I finger comb and blow dry quickly. I've been trying to wear it down more lately, because I've been abusing the ponytail, mostly because it's finally long enough to all stay back. Very exciting to get my hair out of my face. But the exciting thing is that my hair naturally hangs in big waves, so I might be able to get away with my old method for a while longer. Until I get another short haircut that needs special styling again.
