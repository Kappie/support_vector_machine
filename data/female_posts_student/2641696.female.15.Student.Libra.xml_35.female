And invite us to the cast part-ay, dammit!!   Oh yeah - if any of you understand how to find the average speed of a mid-latitude pressure system over the past 24 hours... call me. Please. Because I fucking don't. And that annoys me to no end.   So anyways, ciao guys, see ya'll at choir. Man, I'm talking like an American now. Damn commies.   No, I don't know what I'm talking about, either.
