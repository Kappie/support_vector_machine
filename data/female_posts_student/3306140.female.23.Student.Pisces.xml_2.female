A guy that my friend Ashli knew bought us some drinks. I have a very high tolerance for alcohol but my friend does not. She started to act really crazy and doing crazy things. Her and the gut start fighting and she was hitting him. It all got really out of control real fast. I did not know what to do. Luckily this guy that I was talking to name Deon helped me get them apart and home safe. I don't what to ever get like to the point that I do dumb things. Maybe I need to not drink anymore to get that or maybe not.
