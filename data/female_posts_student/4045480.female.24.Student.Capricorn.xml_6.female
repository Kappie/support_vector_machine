I gotta be at work a whole half hour early, so I have to make this quick.  Nothing really to report.  Jimmy Buffet is one week and counting, and I may still be able to go to the Bears game this weekend, but I offered the tix to Dubber's fam as a thank you for letting me come to three Cubs games, and feeding me.  It's the least I could do.  If there is an extra tix I'll go, but they get first dibs.  I'm kinda glad I don't have much else going on, I think partying tomorrow night would kill me, I need sleep, especially if I plan to do Step and go to a Bridal Shower on Saturday morning.  That's all for now, no real insights today, though I have many thoughts swirling in my head, not all of them are shareable tonight, still working on some things.
