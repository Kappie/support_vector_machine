Friday was ok, the food was great and the drinks, too. But I was the only one in our group who doesn't speak Schweizerdeutsch (Swiss German) and the other's got carried away with their blabbermouths and I didn't understand much. Well, I now already understand more but for that I need a lot of concentration and I'm not able to say anything, since they're already gone further with their discussion before I could figure out something to say. Well, for once people were able to see me staying quiet for quite a long time ;)  Saturday was great! We took a train to Bern and met our friends Siv and Daniel there. This time the language was not as much a problem, since we talked in English. Siv comes from Norway and her German is not yet that good. Well, it's more like that she doesn't want to speak German although she could. Bern is so beautiful and the sun was shining... We met Siv and Daniel for the first time IRL (so far we've only talked to them in IRC) and found out that we get along really well. We ate lotsa raclette, drank lotsa wine and played games and laughed a lot. I'm so happy that we start to have a common social context here... Rico's friends took me right away to the group and now we have also Siv and Daniel. What I still miss, are my own friends... But in time I'll get some. At least, when I start my studies.   Oh, gotta reboot. Brb.  2:26 pm  On Sunday we did practically nothing. We were just so exhausted and happy to be able to stay in bed till one o'clock and after that lay lazy on the couch. Well, we did visit Rico's mother but that's it.   So, seems like my Ausl√§nderausweis (permission to stay in the country etc.) is waiting for me. Gotta go get it today.
