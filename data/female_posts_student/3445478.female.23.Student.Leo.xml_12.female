Shawn said he'd come home and I told him not to and that I just needed to hear his voice and it made me feel better already. To make a long conversation short, he's on his way home!~for the night and then he has to leave by 4:30 am. What an amazing husband. I think he just felt like he needed to come home. I feel guilty though. I am worried about him driving all these miles and being exhausted. I gave Nick benadryl and feed him and right now he's out for the count. I didn't want to give him benadryl because the pharmacist was surprised the Dr recommended it for someone as young as Nick. The dose recommends by our Dr is 1/2 tsp and the recommended dosage for a 6 yr old is 1 tsp...Nick is only 3 months old! I was planning on calling the Dr again tomorrow to confirm the benadryl dose recommendation but I didn't know how eles to help Nick. I used all the resources I had and then some. I tried ever trick I knew of. Poor Boy!
