He goes "you want someone who is funny, good looking, good dancer or wants to dance, must be taller than you, can talk to ya normally so there are no awkward silences, and smart."  Well, despite the truth in these words, I can't seem to find a guy that both fits the criteria and wants to go to prom with me.  Sure, 5 guys have asked me to go with them so far and the dance is still three weeks away.  (One of these 5 guys though was a hot random guy that I met in the mall while shopping.   He came up to me, asked for a hug, and started flirting with me.  Then, when I get up to leave, he proceeds to follow me to my car  hints that we should have sex in my car.  My excuse that I'm "a good girl" doesn't discourage his motives.  When I turn him down, he says "I'm not leaving without your number".   It turns out that he is 22 years old and although, I tell him that im only 17, he responds "I won't tell if you don't.")*sigh*      On another note, I found out from TJ that Sam isn't going to ask me to prom.  This is probably due to the fact that he is a) a Mormon b) friends with Kevin, who I'm positive still likes me c) doesn't like my friend Laura.   Despite this setback, there is still hope.  *crosses fingers*   My friend Laura is going with this guy named James, who she has known all her life.  He is a freshman at Elon, good looking, sings and plays the guitar.   He lives in Pittsburgh, but is coming down to take Laura to prom as a favor.  He is planning on bringing a friend along to keep him company  perhaps be my date if I don't get one myself.  So basically, if this whole ordeal works out, I'll be on a blind date for prom.   All in all, I've decided to take this one day at a time.  It is the only way that I can manage to stay somewhat sane.
