I just watched the lifetime movie about that girl who had her baby in walmart...great movie. haha i ate a whole bag of popcorn and some sugar-free animal crackers and a bottle of my fave flavored water. Now im listening to Weezer and kinda feeling lonely...no one has answered my emails. I even told my mom i sent her an email..but did she even write back? no. i bet she hasnt even checked her email, knowing ive sent her something. i even wrote my little brother...no responce. if ya wanna send me an email u know where to get me...pixiestix_21@hotmail.com....same as always....*much love*
