Aw...I just made myself depressed.  I hate exams.  A lot.  They are stressful.  I don't like stress.  I kinda go insane, as Linds will tell you.  And now you're thinking "when wasn't she insane?"  Haha,  very funny, well I'm one step ahead of you...ok, well, I'm not.  And now that I've confirmed your first thoughts, let's move on.  2 down, 3 to go...then SUMMER!!!!!
