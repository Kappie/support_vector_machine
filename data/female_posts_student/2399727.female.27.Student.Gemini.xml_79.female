(1)  Got my grading done.  As of 12:36pm, finished my dissertation work for this weekend.  I can now rest and read what I want to.  (2) Awesome, awesome, awesome Fr. D.  I don't feel so alone and misunderstood anymore.  (3) Awesome, awesome, awesome friends E. and M.  I don't feel so lonely and isolated anymore.    (4) Gonna read about the ' urlLink cheese ' and go out for a stroll in this heat wave later.  (5) Gonna go to the retreat I wanted to go to tomorrow.   urlLink Awesome speaker ; hope it will be revitalizing as we near Holy Week.  After that, to a concert to support Fr. Guy, Jamie et al.  (6) Got my laundry done this morning.  There's nothing as wonderful feeling as clean flannelette sheets.  More to come...
