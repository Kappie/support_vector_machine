I seriously don't know what's wrong with my parents, omg they've been getting on my nerves so much lately. If I say hello the freaking wrong way I get yelled at, seriously WTF? They need prozac or something, I've actually been good. Oh well, I need to act better I guess, hey I'm an actress I can pull it off, anyways I have no choice, especially when I want to go to Nebraska spring break. I can't wait!!! Being apart from the person you love the most in the world really sucks ALOT :(   Like in your eyes I see my future in an instant
