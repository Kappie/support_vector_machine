C'mon so many negatives? :-(  I feel like I should say something but what? You know you'll be really successful...All you need is faith. Cuz I have a whole bunch for you!  I also applied somewhere else to work at and I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that I get it. It's for the 3-11 shift though and I hate working in the afternoons...I totally prefer the mornings but oh well...I need the work and the money so I'll accept it ya know?  Anyway, enough about that stuff....Today...I'll probably hang out with my boyfriend...again. lol.. You know, you can only sick of it so many times. haha. But then again...I love him so it's fun and really great.  Atleast now I can spend as much time with him before I start working and school gets in. Then it'll be really hard to do anything because work and school always comes first on my list.  You know Huey...life gets hard....but all you need to do is pick yourself and dust yourself off and try again. :-)  Anyway, I'm out. Too hot to sit here and type. lol.
