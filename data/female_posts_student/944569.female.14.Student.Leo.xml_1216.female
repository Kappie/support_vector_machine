Except for the fact that TFS tried to suck more money out of us by charging for drinks and food *cough cough* and blocked off every single exit to a water fountain followed by the fact that most people didn't bring their money and had to resort to drinking tap water.  Stupid TFS, those greedy and avaricious monkeys only interested in monetary matters.  Damn them!  Daaaaaamn them!  I'm going to write an article to the school newspaper on how the school charges us all the time and how stupid it is (uniforms are really overpriced and if students buy a cheaper kind it's considered out of uniform,  charging outrageous prices for food, charging ppl so that they can use the photocopier, not being able to use your cell phone in the building which pretty much forces you to use their payphone and finding more sinister and evil ways to charge more money.)  I rest my case.
