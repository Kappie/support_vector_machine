We were almost at the corner of George and Regent. Then we see this shitty ass red car go through the RED light and of course there is a big ass truck coming the other way on the green light. Well the both hit then of course the red car is coming towards Brandi and I. Well the car hit the pole that was about 5 feet away from us. Thank god we were not 30 seconds faster because we would have been right in front of that telephone pole.   Brandi and I where both in shock for most of the night. We couldn't believe that we where so lucky to be alive. Thankfully no one was serious hurt. Anyways have a good night.
