Melanie Barnes La Trobe Secondary College, Macleod  February 23rd 2004  To the representative for the SRC Dear sir/madam,  Hello my name is Melanie Barnes and I am a currently a student at La Trobe Secondary College. I am writing to you to address the issue of increased absenteeism within our school. After recently reading an article published by the Herald Sun I think it is about time we do something to tackle this growing problem. Although I do believe truancy and absenteeism is a fairly global issue I do believe that there are a few things that we can do in this school to try and improve the situation.  As a student myself, I understand the struggle it can be sometimes to get out of bed in the morning and come to a place that you don’t want to be at. Because a vast majority of the students don’t enjoy being here I think that a few major changes need to be made to class curriculum. Certain classes I’m sure are attended more frequently than others. This is because they capture that child’s interests. I believe that if we make the other classes catch the child’s interests they will attend these regularly as well.  Seems students are young they don’t understand how important these years are and if they can find something better to do than go to school they will.  That’s why I believe we need to add some variety to the curriculum and make it more interesting. It becomes a problem because we constantly do the same thing “year in year out”. We go to school sit in a classroom and half the time our subject matters overlap and it appears useless to be at school, as well as boring so hopefully adding some variety will lower truancy numbers and help improve attendance but it might just be the wake up call that parents need.  As the Herald Sun Article suggests, parent's disciplinary actions are softening. They are putting petty things such as family shopping trips in front of their child’s schooling, not knowing the impact it is having. The softening attitudes are leading to the children taking more “sickies” than truly necessary. This also comes under parents letting their children sleep in then giving them the day off because of this. I think that maybe for the parents to realise what they are doing as Shadow Education Minister Victor Parton suggests, maybe their child welfare payments need to be reduced for those that cannot get their child to school frequently enough.  To take another angle on in maybe our recording mechanisms need to be looked at as well. Our current systems record the absenteeism rate of our students but it doesn’t look at why. I think that the reasons for the child being away needs to be categorised and then recorded to enable a calculation at the end of each term and/or semester. After this a decision needs to be made to whether parents need to be contacted or the child requires special provision.  Well I thank you for taking the time to read my opinions and I hope that for future refrences for problems in this area you will take my ideas into consideration.  Respectfully, Melanie Banes
