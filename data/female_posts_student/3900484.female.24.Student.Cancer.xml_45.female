And its not like Im visiting a hot-spot in the nation or anything.  It's only Omaha.  But still, it's outside KS.  I am only slightly worried, I've been stressing over what to wear and what to say.  I think my enthusaism will come across either way, so that will help.  I think I've decided on some khakis and a nice shirt, maybe just a polo one or something.  I want to look nice, but I have at least a 4 hour drive.  I think he'll be understanding about that.  I guess what I wear shouldn't really factor into how well the meeting goes, anyway. I did agree to publish my paper (notice the "my").  Everyone I've said something to about it has just said that unfortunately, I'm just being inducted to the jerky world of academia a little early.  So it sucks, but at least when I ran into my advisor yesterday, she made it sound like it was more for my benefit than hers.  So maybe she won't want credit for it.  Either way, I guess it would be nice to say i've been published.  Plus it would probably help when applying to grad schools.  Sort-of on that note, I finished typing up my CV yesterday, and its looking good.  I've got three pages of how wonderful I am. I had a dream last night, about camp.  It was very strange, because when I checked my email today, I had 2 letters from a bunk-mate of mine that was in a cabin with me a couple of years ago (that must have been my magic at work again). She actually went back this summer, which Im a little jealous of.  I haven't really accomplished much this summer.  I could be back having fun in PA.  It was weird to think of the kids I was a counselor for, they are in the Dorm this summer, which means they are about 16 or 17.  crazy.  They were 12-13 the two years I was there.  I wonder what the waterfront looks like now.  They were planning a big renovation.  Everytime I hear the song "American Pie" it makes me think of them.  That was our call to lunch song.  UGH.  I almost want to go look through photo albums now.  The girls in my bunk are like the daughters I'll never have (because Im not sure I can handle kids, after looking after my parents).  Ooo that was mean, huh?  I remember that for my birthday, they decorated the bunk and made me a huge card in arts and crafts.  It was great. I have so much that I need to work on getting done before thursday, I just don't feel like doing it.  I made myself a list of stuff to get done tonight at work.  I'm good at planning to do stuff, its just the actual "doing" part that I have trouble with.  I suppose I should go work on my bio stuff for my advisor tomorrow though.  I've been slacking enough on it for all summer.  Since school starts in 2 weeks, I feel its time to be motivated.
