When you meet a girl who doesn't play games with you, don't play them with her. There's a reason she doesn't play games, so try to respect that. And if you're going to tell a girl that you like her, and you're going to have this conversation with her, then don't be shady about it after you have this discussion. You're fucking with her, and you're looking like an asshole when you may not be one. So give up the bullshit for once, okay? Yeah, that's my statement for the day.
