(he is different now and only one person knows who it is) he gave me the finger this morning but he was smiling. when i got home i slept. then my mom woke me up, we had the dumbest conversation: Mom: time to eat! Me: nope, not hungry Mom: so you're not eating Me: no Mom: does that mean you're not coming Me: no Mom: so you're not eating Me: no Mom: why aren't you coming Me: dunno Mom: so when are you coming? Me: MOM!!!!!!! Mom: oh, okay my mom is pretty ditzy but that was extra funny. my guinea pig is the best. fudgie i love you! she recognizes me and stuff. today i have a french test which is bound to be horrible. then i slept for the rest of the night. i woke up at 11 and did my homework and i went back to sleep. this morning i walked! yay! i'm going to rachelle's tonight because cell is at her house. and because i love her. i had the most halarious conversation with heather last night. it was like we were stoned but we weren't. we laughed so hard for such a long time at nothing but it was fun. today is going to suck i can feel it. i'm a pessimist, but mostly right.
