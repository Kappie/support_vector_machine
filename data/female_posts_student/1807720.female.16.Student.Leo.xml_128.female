I have trust issues you know and well it was a little bit (ok well not a little bit, but really) it was was really hard to trust some people I don't know.  And well they did finish their work and our project is done and it's all ready to present for tomorrow.  In Drama Mr. B wants me to like play my flute when the audience are walking in and while there are scene changes going on.  He wants me to do so much and it makes me feel so important.  I guess that is because I have a very important part in the Drama presentations tomorrow night at the open house.  After our little run through of everything today he even was like "And lets thank Vanessa for all that she is doing" and everyone clapped for ME!  Just for me - no one else.  It truly was an applause, a 100% dedicated applause just to me.  That makes me feel so incredibly special.  Even when I was sitting upstairs in the Science Wing and eating my lunch, Ms. LaCour said "Hi Vanessa."  Of course if she said that to anyone else I don't think they would appreciate it as much as I do.  No one hardly ever stops to say "hi" to me anymore.  It's like sometimes I'm invisible and the whole world can see, but they can only see beyond me and not what is in front of their eyes.  If that makes any sense.  I guess what I am trying to get across is that I felt noticed you know.  I do like it when people just say "hi" to me, because it doesn't happen a lot.  Active Living was the best today!  We played broomball and I like got my right hand all scratched up and even broke my nail off.  It actually really hurt and now there is blood on my new expensive jacket.  It was so fun though.  The guys even gave me a nickname - Work Horse!  LOL, ok Mr. Swain was like "You know she has a name and it's Vanessa" but you know what, I actually kind of liked being called Work Horse.  The guys said they called me that because I worked harder than all of them.  I would do all the work, then they would just score.  They even were like "C'mon Work Horse we want you to score for us" and like they helped me score a goal!  That was awesome and I think I am going to make my MSN name Work Horse - cause I do work my ass off - I'm a work horse!  How cute!  After class Mr. Swain even told me that I worked harder than anyone else and I beat out everyone out there.  That was an amazing compliment to get from someone like him.  It made me feel good.  Of course now I have to end my journal entry with boring ole' English.  That class well was boring, but I mean C'mon every good day has it's boring class.  Now that can't be debated.  You know I think the list of people who made in to the cast of A Mid Summer's Night Dream is being posted tomorrow.  I really can't wait because I know for a fact my audition was really good.  I just hope I am on the list.  If I am not then it's not the end of the world, but I do have confidence in myself that my name very well may be on there.  Fingers crossed!
