I kinda doubt it's gonna happen, but hey, at least we're trying. Everything is all better with friends, so that's cool. I'm "working" on my damn project for english. Actually I really am getting some work done on it, so that's good. I found a couple sites that will really save me ass. So yeah. I miss Ben. Today is a better day. Kristin  Later: I LOVE THE MATRIX!!!!
