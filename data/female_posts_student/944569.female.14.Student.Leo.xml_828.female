    
       I close my eyes Only for a moment and the moments gone All my dreams Pass before my eyes of curiosity Dust in the wind All we are is dust in the wind Same old song Just a drop of water in an endless sea All we do Crumbles to the ground although we refuse to see Dust in the wind All we are is dust in the wind  Don't hang on Nothing last forever but the earth and sky it sneeks away And all your money won't another minute by Dust in the wind All we are is dust in the wind Dust in the wind Everything is dust in the wind
