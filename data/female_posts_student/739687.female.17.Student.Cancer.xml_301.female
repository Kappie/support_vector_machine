It seemed like I was just having a horrible day, and I was just so upset about everything, so down, and everything just sucked. Then, later that night, as I was just giving up on  everything  that had been dragging me down, everything suddenly turned around to shock me. Everything, within maybe...an hour...just went...incredibly  right.   Saturday was Warped Tour, and it kicked ass of course. Good good times.  I think that for once, I'm refusing to let things get me down. I'm refusing to let others claim the victory. And it's funny, because the harder people try, the more I realize that I don't have to care. I don't have to care about situations that drag me down. Because people that drag me down aren't worth my time. So thanks, to all who have helped me realize this. I'm much stronger than people make me out to be. I've got way more self control in these sort of situations than I ever really thought I could have.  I just think drama is stupid. So why the  hell  would I get caught up in it?    If you're going to be dramatic, then keep me out of it. I have better things to do. :)    Fabulous.  I get my license in a week. :) :) :) :) :) :) :)  Cool it down a notch, crazies. It's gettin a bit hot.
