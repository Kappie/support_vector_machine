I did something productive (I thought those of you who know me could use a good laugh.)I really did work today though. It's true I left early and didn't stay the whole time, but hey baby steps. Other than that my day has been very uneventful. I came home and slept, which means I missed going to the play (oh darn.) I'm so incredibly bored. There really isn't anyone online to talk to or anything on tv to watch. Poor poor me.   While I'm here I think I'll make a list of the top ten things I hate.  1. jeans that don't have back pockets  ~not only do they look stupid but back pockets can come in handy  2. stupid/immature people  ~i've always been too mature for my age  3. school  ~I shouldn't have to explain this one  4. reality tv  ~reality? I think not  5. cheese  ~never acquired the taste for it  6.The olsen twins  ~lets try for some more separate dramatic roles shall we  7. shirts with necklines cut off  ~trying to cut some corners when it comes to fabric people?  8. people who think they know everything when in fact they don't have a clue  ~I know plenty of them  9. ugg boots and mini skirts  ~Charlie  10. people who try to steal my friends  ~I'm very possessive
