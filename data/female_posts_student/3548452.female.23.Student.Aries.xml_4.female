When I look in your eyes I see the eyes of our children; I look at your face to see their features and their smile, And I can tell by the look in your eyes that in me you see the same. When we touch I feel that we belong together; like pieces of a puzzle, and i can feel your heart beat the way mine beats for yours; the way your hands tremble as they reach for mine. When we're close and we kiss, a certain sweetness; a powerful perfection caused coincidentally by love's hold on our lives, feeds as the perfume of your skin weaves its way into my soul. When we talk I like to listen; your voice is like a soothing medicine for the ache in my soul; When I speak I know you'll listen and you know I'll listen too. When I reach into your soul I feel the pull, I see the love and I hear the cry from the ache in your soul, telling me you see my ache, and you see my heart; it swells with love for you.  5/1/2004 My crazy heart wont stop loving you No matter how much I try I think of all the reasons why I shouldnt  all the times you've made me cry You seem to have a part of me That I wanted to let go I know you dont care if I love you but I just wanted you to know So jut how much do I love you? Let me tell you now: There is no other on this earth That I love more than I love you now It's so much that it makes my chest hurt  I worry about you every moment I'm awake Just when I think I've had enough I wonder how much more I can take  when I'm not near you you always seem To fill the thoughts in my mind, At night I dream about you  the memories left behind  if you ever wonder if This love I have is true, Just know that every day that I wake up Is another day I'm missing you.  7/28/99 Love What is love? It is a moment undefinded, It is a place of understanding, it is a shared heart of life- Its victories, its sorrows, Its mistakes, its successes.  Love is the good with the bad, Love is the acceptance of faults, Love is the willingness to overlook.  But most of all- Love is the desire to please, Love is the sacrifice of greed, Love is the blinding moment that words fall too short of to express... In the glance of love, emotions speak to the soul- numbing the mind with the esscence of love. It is the raw chemistry of life shaclking our decisions of choice- leaving us helpless vicitms to its power. Love can heal or love can hurt- Love can carry you to the heavens, Love can drown you in dying pain- It cares not the direction for love is truly blind, Love is not a place- It is a ride to that place.
