Cause this is what I wanted.. right?   Right.   So Im going through another Ben Folds stage, and finding all this new [well new to me] and great stuff. Its more of my happy music, it makes me dance.  And my family is going to a cottage for the next week I think? So I wont be posting, not that Id be posting anyway, since its SUMMER and beautiful out. Well not for the past couple of days but whatever.  Speaking of crappy weather, oh baby, I didnt write about the concert. Well, APRIL WINE and HOOTIE was amazing. Bloody amazing. Behn made a sign for april wine and they talked to us and everything. And pointed! I want to find out who that guitar/keyboard/vocals/tamborine! guy is because he was like The most talented person ever and yet hes not on their website or in any of the band pictures. So Im a bit curious about that.   ..PS Tyler missed the concert sooo yes he sucks. Plus our new friend, aka random drunk-off-his-ass guy. He was a good singer [not really] but he was very.. uhhhhh.. friendly.  Anyway what else is new.. ok nothing, and Im tired. So go to bed.  Ok, sounds good.   He shouted out his last word And he stumbled through the yard And she shattered her last china plate And spun off in the car When he lunged onto the hood She stopped to tell him she'd been wrong He was thrown head over heels Into the traffic coming on But then All is fair in love
