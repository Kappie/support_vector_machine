Last night she sleep over (without my mother knowing ofcourse). It seems that we have picked up exactally where we left off when we parted ways about four years ago. Tonight we will probably get together again and possibly sleep over again. To bad she has to go home on Sunday, but, she is now a member of two websites with me so we'll keep in touch.She actually just left my house at about noon, before my mom got home. I don't think it would have looked very good if I were caught sneeking Abby in and out of my house at midnight.
