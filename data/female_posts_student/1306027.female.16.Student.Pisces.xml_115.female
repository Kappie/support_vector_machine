Which, is not good seeing as we tend to use all peoples allotted to work. Yeah, so, according to the universal law of suckage, the day we are short is the day we get blitzkrieged. People were cranky... workers were cranky, and I have never heard my boss cuss so much in my life. I don't think I have ever heard anyone cuss that much. Lol. It was bad. Work got somewhat easier in the afternoon when business slowed down ever so slightly. I got to clean the sandwich station as my last timmy chore. *Bleh*  I was so upset at one point, someone asked me if I was about to kill someone.. and I was like "Stress comes custom with our uniforms" and they just smiled and walked off. Hmmm.. A smile. Like the only one I got today. YARG! Also, The Pizza Hut GM came in and watched as I made a sandwich over again 3 times for drive-through. After that, I thought regina might reach out and strangle someone at the drive-through.. lol.. So, the Pizza Hut GM, sympathic to our struggle, offered to send over pizza's for lunch. Free of charge. I told her she didn't have too, and she shook her head and said, "You take care of us, we take care of you!" I was like.. "Dude, your so awesome!" And 2 hours later.. there were the pizza's!    *Sigh*  Thank God I only have to work 5 hours sat. and 5 hours sun. I mean, I love that I am going to be getting some awesome checks, but I really need a break from the 8 hour shifts... cause they suck. They suck muffins. Plus, I carry over into two work crews, which, I normally don't like. I mean, I love certain people- in fact, most people. But other people, it's like- Good God! Do Something! Anything! Stock! Clean! But, alas, these people seem hard of hearing. I have experienced it, Katie has experienced it (sadly so too.. poor katie..) and so has just about every other experienced worker at Timmy's. It's a given really. I can't wait till they hire new people. Maybe we'll actually get a good worker out of this round... *cough cough*  Anyways, I got to talk to Arturo last night. I forewarned him of "The Letter" and after that we just talked about camp and stuff- for 2 hours. Lol, it was great. We were gonna try to see who could stay up longer without passing out over the phone, but then my mom came upstairs to go to sleep, and I was like "O Crap! I gotta go!"... haha, so it ended up pretty much in a draw. Which, you know, draws are cool.    I leave you with this... Sledding down a hill on a scanner and in an old crappy skirt is not advisable.
