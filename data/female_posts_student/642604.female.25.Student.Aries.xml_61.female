I have to figure out what beer it is for so I can find the commercial online and post a link! [ Thu Apr 24, 08:11:27 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] I am a total bitch. I rather liked living on my own and am not thrilled my roommate is home from his four day vacation. What's even worse is I am going from one to three as his girlfriend is staying the night as well. I am really not in the mood to deal with either. Not that I don't like them, it's just that I am already missing my own life, I now have to be accomodating to others again... and not just one BUT TWO! AHHHHH!
