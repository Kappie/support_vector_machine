Most of them were pretty cheap because there was no state sales tax, and many people were having sales. lmfao. I got 2 pairs of pants from one store that were originally 48 dollars each, but i ended up getting them for like 42 dollars all together. So they were like 21 dollars. I think thats pretty good considering the jeans actually fit me and didnt look ugly. Seriously. Whenever I come across cheap pants, they usually fit me just right, but they're way too long. Or they're the right length, but they're too baggy.  But you know, nothing in wetseal fit me, and their pants were like 40 dollars. Well, I got a shirt that was 5 dollars (it was originally like 15 or 25, I forgot)...  Yeah, yeah. I'll stop talking about clothes.  I think I'm gonna eat my salsa even though its been out for like... 4 days. :-D
