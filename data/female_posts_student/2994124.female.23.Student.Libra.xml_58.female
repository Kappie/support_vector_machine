Navs - Navigators - see guestbook on the Arbarbablog or check out http://navigators.co.uk 3. No you don't get smitted/smoted or anything else if you miss Navs bible study. In fact I found out that 2 other girls bunked off too and went for a walk and chat.  Think we probably talked more about God and stuff anyway. 4. I'm studying Health Promotion - and no that doesn't mean just telling people to eat healthily and exercise.  There are two main areas we study - individual approach: behaviour change, education, lots of psycholoy stuff and then community based work: community health development, policy change, advocay, empowerment etc. which is what I want to do. 5. On the night of the 26th July 1996 I was probably at home in bed.  Had good day yesterday. Managed to work on assignments from 10am till 3pm  with only a half hour break.  Then went and looked after kiddies, then went and had pizza and went bowling with some friends.  I used to be not too bad at bowling but haven't played in about 4 years so I was working on the whole 'first shall be last and the last shall be first' philosophy, but it didn't work! I actually came 4th out of 6 (and i was the 2nd girl) so not too bad.   Have just met up with my tutor and had a really fasciniating discussion of self-esteem and self-worth and what creates it, maintains it and destroys it.  Also how we have medicalised it, given it a title and tried to measure and quantify it.  We have turned it into some formula, like if you have 5 points on this scale and 10 on the other then you will turn out with high self esteem. It's all interesting stuff. I've really learned a lot about myself during this module.  I think we should support Marsha and all campaing against magazines like that in public libraries. I'm good at writing letters - do you want me to write one Marsha?!!
