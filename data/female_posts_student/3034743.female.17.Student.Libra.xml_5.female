I'm glad this day went the way it did. It's about damn time things went my way! haha j/k. I like this song Ocean Avenue by Yellowcard. It's cool. I like some of the lyrics:  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I don't know why, I just think it's cool. I don't think I've been in this good a mood for awhile now, and it's nice.
