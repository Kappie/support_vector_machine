She stared and replied, "Yeah, except for that whole war thing."  Touche. And yet, I still hold this dream of living in the forties. I would have those gorgeous bouncing waves in my hair, and wear red lipstick and adorable dresses and swimsuits, and I'd feel the solidarity of hating Hitler and loving FDR along with the rest of America. I could gossip with my girlfriends and crochet socks for the boys overseas, and i would probably have a dog like Skip.  I know, though, that I would also be unhappy, because I would suck at being a forties girl. I look terrible in red lipstick, and I couldn't possibly sleep every night with bobby pins sticking my scalp. They wouldn't even be the cool kind with the ball tips - no, they would probably cut my head. I bet that old lipstick was the kind that stains your lips and gets all over your teeth, too.  The other girls wouldn't like me, either, because I'd be too weird. I'd be loud and I would speak my opinions and talk about "boy" things and they'd get bored. And teachers would be like, "Audrey, shut up about Nietzsche, it's time to bake." And boys would think I was pretty with my great hair and stuff, but I talked too much, and I wouldn't sleep with them (because it wasn't societally okay back then, for the most part) so there would be no fun in it. So I'd, like, sit around crocheting and talking politics to my dog, but the only interesting thing to talk about would be how Hitler sucked, and even that would get old.  I'd probably dream of being a movie star or something, but the directors would get annoyed and fire me for being a diva or something. Or else I'd have to wear fur and shit all the time, and plug Ovaltine and war bonds and whatnot, and that would get boring.  I guess I don't really want to transplant myself into the time period, so much as I want to be one of those girls, but like, I guess the kind who goes to college and stuff.  It just seems nice, like everything back then was laid out for teenagers. Don't have sex, go to school, eat your dinner, and everything went the way it should.  I would be resentful, but I wouldn't be so confused.
