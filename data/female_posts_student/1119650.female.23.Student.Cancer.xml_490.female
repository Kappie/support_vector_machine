Ideally I'd like to go back to the Caribbean on a  urlLink cruise , that was a blast and the water and scenery and weather was just amazing.  Its not that I haven't been having fun, but I just need to get out of the area for a while.  I'm feeling really weird.  Montreal was a nice and well needed break, I just wish it had been a little longer.     urlLink The Bride  and  urlLink groom  from the wedding we attended this weekend are going to Turks  Caicos for their honeymoon.  I wish I could stow away in their suitcases.  I'm also thinking that since my last 2 birthdays (21st  22nd) were so C R A P P Y that I'd go on vacation for my 23rd birthday just so I don't have to be disappointed by other people's crap.    Does anyone have any good suggestions for places that are tropical and warm and not exorbitantly priced for a vacation?  Also, please bear in mind that I absolutely HATE flying and I live on the eastern coast of the U.S. so I'm near major transportation hubs (like the 79th street Boat Basin in Manhattan).
