I havent been this confused, for over a year now. and just when I think that things are beginning to look up for me..BAM! things just hit me like a train, and I dont know what to do.. I cant just tell people my confusion, first of all, they most likley dont care and just want some dirt to burn me with later, and if they do care, they have no clue of what to say, or do to help me, which to me is absolutly pointless. So I have to sit here completly alone, and try and console myself through this, before someone makes a move. I dont want anyone to make a move..I dont want to have to regret any of my actions. I dont want to be forced into a decision I dont think I can full heartily make. Especially because I know how it feels and I dont want to be the reason for another broken heart.  I dont think I could put either one of them through that. Plus there best Friends. Now, how am I supposed to deal with that. If I would do anything with one, they would probably just turn around and go tell the other, and vice versa. And I know that that feels like an extreme kick to the chest. I wish that this would all go away. I even felt like going away to some far off place and putting thisall behind me, that way they would both come out even. Because neither one of them is better than the other.  I cant keep this all in my head though..I might just go completly insane and up a wall if I would. And for fear of someone involved in this, reading this, and getting more info then what I need for them to have, I cant write anything that they can take out of context. So to save myself from more of a head ache, and more pain..Im going to stop here..and if I can I'll write later.  pain is inevitalbe, misery is optional...enjoy the ride.
