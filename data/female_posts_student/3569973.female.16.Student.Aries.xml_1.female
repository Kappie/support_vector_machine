Then I went up to Royal Pizza after Danie called me and told me to go up there cause they were hiring...so I did...wish me luck. Although I really dont want a job that bad, it would be great to have extra money, plus the fact that I have to pay for my car, insurence, and gas...kinda sucks so I mean I wont have that much extra money...when it all comes down to it...Ill probably only have like $10. lol. But what can ya do. Well thats all for now I think im gonna go find something to munch on and watch a movie.
