Song: Local God- Everclear ( kay, the whole song is going in today, coz it's all brilliant) ('You do that Romeo, Be what you wanna be, Look like youre runnin in place, Do that stupid dance for me, Do that Romeo, That go-go Romeo, I see you twist and turn, you look so stupid, happy and numb. Be my Romeo, Please be my voice in this world. I can't sing the songs that you sing, I can't find the gorgeous words. Will you be my Romeo, My go-go Romeo? I see you twist and turn, you look so stupid.  I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys. We do what we want, yes we do what we want. I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys. We do what we want, yes, we do what we want. We do what we want. Yeah, we do what we want.  Be my Romeo, Tell me all about your love, Tell me all about your pain, Baited breath and rubber gloves. Be my Romeo, My go-go Romeo, I see you twist and turn, You look so fuckin stupid.  Mmmm, Mmmm, I, I, I, I, I, I,  I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys. We do what we want, yes we do what we want. Those summer days can lead to the bad times, The world gets larger every day, Yeah, yeah, those summer days can lead to the bad blood times, They left me feelin stupid, happy, and numb, numb, Stupid, happy, and numb. I feel so stupid, happy, and numb, Mmmm, Stupid, happy, and numb,  I feel so stupid, I feel so stupid. I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys. We do what we want, we do what we want I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys. We do what we want. We do what we want, We do what we want. We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, Yeah, we do what we want. Oh, Yes, we do what we want. Oh, Yeah, we do what we want. Oh,  Yea, We do what we want, We do what we want.')   How much does Shakespeare rock? He really does? My god if he was alive today I would soooo love that man, only if he looked like Joseph Fiennes though ( who is possibly the only man with good facial hair). Anyway back to the bard, I've just realized how absolutely super duper great he is. I mean he did write Romeo and Juliet and Midsummer Night's dream, which are respectively my favourite film, and play. Also his film has a great soundtrack. Which leads me on the to the unappreciated genius of Baz Luhrman, he is twice the director Spielberg will ever be. Sorry it just has to be said! He is great!  Anyway I'm done with my random praising now. Feeling quite fulfilled at the moment, I've done more on my at...A page devoted to Romeo and Juliet as I was watching it at the same time, and I had started subconsciously writing the thing out in my book, good job it was in pencil. Anyway said I'd stop talking about that now, coz I’m really getting obsessed...damned soundtrack it's all that's fault!!!!!  Anyway I shall now advertise something very dear to my heart. Those who know me will have no doubt heard of my incurable addiction to Nesquik Cereal. This is, in my opinion, a marvel of what modern knowledge and technology. Knowing this, it is perhaps nobody’s surprise that I was elated to discover that my favourite cereal has now been turned into a cereal bar. I can know have nesquik cereal wherever I am, and they are very useful just before you go out the house if you don't have time to eat, as they contain 1/4 (or whatever) of your daily calcium requirements.  In conclusion my praising things blog shall end with the undeniable fact that... Will Shakespeare (here he is eating a quill)    Baz Luhrman   and Nesquick Cereal bars   Are all totally some of the best things since sliced bread, which is also very good.  All for now Dani
