No one can ever take her place because whats special about her is that not only is she my mommy but also my best friend. I can talk to her about anything and though it might take her forever to understand me in the end she always ends up understanding me.Sometimes i dont take the time to even tell her a thank you or how much i really am grateful for al that she does for me. I cant see myself alone without her nor without my daddy.Yeah i love my daddy too hes a good dad too though sometimes he can be really jealous but i know he wuvs me. But the connection that i have with my mami is different from the one i have with my dad.   My mom has been there since the day i walked into this world actually i jus fell out but u know what i mean.She has all the qualitys for a mother: loving, caring, trustworthed, understandable, and all the other good things. She has done so much for me and i just want to thank her for being the greates mommi anyone could ever have...   There are several times that i have ran to my dad for my problems or if i did something bad sometimes it was better to tell my dad because my mommy exagerates alot sometimes, ok well most of the time but i still love him cuz hes lovable jus like a teddy bear.      ~p.s I LOVE YOU MOMMY!!!~        ~p.s.s I LOVE YOU TOO DADDY!!!~
