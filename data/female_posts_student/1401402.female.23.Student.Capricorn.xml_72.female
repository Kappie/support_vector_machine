Me, I was compared to a ROSE. Very dangerous to be around with. My color would capture a lot of attention but I have thorns that would hurt people deeply. And very expensive.   My eyeballs grew wide open; almost choke on coffee for a second there. Really? Am I that dangerous? NOWAY. Damn, I cannot protest with this one.    Gee, I think that I am to be more of a velvet lily. Fresh, pretty, clam, shy, cheap, very insecure. Can’t hurt anyone because lilies don’t have thorns. In addition, I do not hurt people. Unless people was to hurt me first. Now that’s an exception.
