Everything was going smooth with the cleaning until I decided that I was going to put pictures of my mission trips to Mexico and Taiwan up on my bulletin board, behind my bed. While doing this I dropped one of my pictures and it went under my bed. So I did the only logical thing... I reached under the bed to get it. I'm still not sure how it happened but somehow I managed to mangle my finger on one of the metal bars that's under there. Now, we're not talking about just a little scratch. This thing was  gushing!  I couldn't get it to stop bleeding! Finally after about 25 minutes it stopped. The whole experience made me ill and my finger STILL hurts! On the bright side, my room is finally starting to come together. I can actually see the floor again!  I finally got to talk to Tyler last night. It was so nice just to here his voice! Hopefully we'll get to hang out on Thursday. It's been awhile since we've had the chance to do so, and it'll play right into my diabolical scheme. Ok, it isn't really diabolical, but it is a surprise. I'm so excited about it! I can't wait to see his reaction. But shhhhhh... LOL!
