I added lots of drawings to my website as well as the MMU comics (Megaman Unleashed) Hahaha!  I love the new picture i did.  Please no flames or insults.  It's my first few times trying Photoshop... The better pics are at the bottom...Don't forget to read the stories i wrote (i know you wont since they're all about anime *nyahahaha*)  BTW, i'm not that good yet but if you guys have any pictures you want to scan and colour, don't hesitate to ask me.  I'd only be too glad to help you.  http://riceballgirl.bravehost.com
