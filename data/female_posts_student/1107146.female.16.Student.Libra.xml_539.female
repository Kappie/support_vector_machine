I really don't want to see that again...I don't think any of us do. That is why I'm so against you being with him. I know I shouldn't attack you...I tried for the past couple of weeks but I'm not exactly in control of how I feel. Anyway, basically sorry that I'm constantly attacking him. Oh yea...I don't trust him...not until he proves himself that he can be. Hope everything turns out ok...
