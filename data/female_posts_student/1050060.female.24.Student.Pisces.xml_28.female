Today i was up at 5:30am and i couldn't get back to sleep. I felt like sleeping through class. So i went to bed at 12 last night and i had a total of 5 and half hours. Once Brandi is done class we will go home. I need to take a nice long two hour nap this afternoon. Well i am going to go and do some homework. Have a nice day!
