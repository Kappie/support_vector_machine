I guess i'll lets ya's all know a little about me, Im 17, irish and just love to have fun. I got great friends and fantastic enemies. What really ticks me off are ppl who lie, who are snobby and just really selfish ppl... but then again I love to be around funny and intellectually stimulating ppl.  My favourite colours is green/yellow Lucky number is 38 favourite music is a mix of robbie william, matchbox 20 and a twist of old style - elton, bowie, elvis etc.  Currently in year 12 and loving school, altho i can't wait to get out, i wanna travel- see the whole world. Especially Eygpt, Peru, Guatemala, Rome, Paris, Germany all those types of places- i cant wait   Oh well lunch is ready  must go  love Urleen
