Er, I'm a 14 year old girl who currently lives in Oklahoma, at least the last time I checked I did. I have 2 older brothers, Matt (20 years of age) and John (17 years of age), and most of the time I can't stand either of them! Well, I'm thinkin I'm going to post a picture on my next post because this computer won't let me, since it's stupid and a piece of crap!!! ANYWAYS! There is absolutely nothing to post in this thing right now. Nothing important has happened to me lately. Well actually, come to think of it, something has.               Ok, so like, one of my good 'ol friends Jake R. was at Utica Square when I went with Mads, and I hadn't seen him in FOREVER! No joke, almost 6 years, and I saw Murray, or.. yeah, something like that. I don't remember his name or how to spell it. Utica Square is officially the place to be on Thursdaynights. I'm going everytime now, at least when I can make it! It's so much fun, haha I got home andI had dirt in my hair from when Jaketackled me, and me and JJ were laying in thegrass. OOO! And I saw Papi, Pat, Patrick S.whatever you want to call him, there! But I didn't get to talk to him because, well... I don'tknow? And one more thing, I think all the Carver/Booker T. Washington people are warming up to me. They used to think I was a bitch because at Kelsey's party I was way WAY tired, like I could barely stand up, and I felt sick, and i was FREEZING! And at the Carver Prom, my stomach was killing me because of cramps, so I didn't want to dance or do anything, and when Eric kept forcing me to dance I got pissy. So to all the Carver/Booker T. Washington people, you know I'm not usually like that, I swear. You guys just caught me on bad nights.       Ok, so maybe I didn have alot to say. I'm just one of those unpredictable girls most of the time that will suddenly think of something to say, and say it! Muahahaha! >=D Yes, I am evil.. evil fairy princess. Lolz, anyways... I'll chat ya up later!
