How bad a day can be.... -___- Anyway, I visited this 'The Tribe' website, I think this show is about a toxic waste that caused teachers and adults to disppear but left with children and teenagers with funny and exotic face paints and hairstyles. And, Boy! Is this show long or what! It is showing on Channel i on Sunday in the afternoon for about 2 hours and we are still st Series 1 while 'The Tribe' had proceeded to Series 5 with so many twists and I doubt that I am able to keep up with it... -____- Haiz.... I hope I can link to this website and everybody can visit it. On the whole, this show is interesting as it shows the world CAN go wrong without adults and now every kid is fighting for a place, for a position, a time to be able to dominate the world, while some just want peace and harmony.....
