I just wanted to brag, that the day of the concert we're going up to Toronto for the day, going on a SUBWAY!, a subway! crazy! going to all the cool stores and other cool buildings in T.dot lol. Then going to the Spaghetti factory, then the concert, then Chris finally gets to meet my Daddy!, he lives in Hamilton...After 8 months, he still hasnt met him, so we're spending the night there after the concert instead of driving all the way home. Hamilton is only half an hour from toronto. So braggity brag brag,...haha
