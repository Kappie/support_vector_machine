I leave today for Quesnel, spending the weekend camping with the Boy, go to Vancouver on Monday, stay there, shop tuesday, depart vancouver at 4 in the afternoon en route to Dublin. We land in Dublin at 5 in the evening Thursday. B still wants to go techno dancing or something that night. Fine with me, but I think she'll be too tired.  I am very excited. It seems like whenever I go on a big trip, I think about it so much that when I actually leave it seems so surreal.    Speaking of surreal...my day yesterday was so insane. Rafiki and I went to the PGX, saw old teacher, looked at the animals...lots of jokes only her and I would appreciate followed. We didn't stay long. Headed over to the art gallery, got in free, rafiki fell down the steps, more laughter. We played in the kids area upstairs for a long time. Costumes, magnets, puppets...tehehe. ran through the sprinklers, got soaked, see through skirt...yeah. Layed on the grass, talked about sex, loosing innocence, the usual. rafiki and I are more alike in taht department now again. after a year. sad and not so.   I needed to say goodbye to Eevy. Even if he didn't come out for supper, I had to speak to him. I did. I was shaking. He felt awful about not coming for supper, he wasn't there, and since I'm leaving today, he wouldn't have time to. So I asked if he could take a break and get some coffee. Which has been a dream of mine forever, to go get coffee with him and just talk. Which is what happened. My skirt was still a bit wet and I was very self consious, which kinda made things uncomfortable, but still a dream fulfilled is always good. He is amazing. I kept thinking how crazy this is while he was talking I would just look...man you are so beautiful. We stayed there and talked for about half an hour, then he ahd to go back. Walked me to my car, and then there was that kinda akward few seconds when he stands close and you know he's gonna hug you, which I couldn't believe at teh time either, it all still seems like it didn't happen.  but it did and he did hug me, a one arm stiff hug, but still. I drove home with a huge grin on my face, my cheeks hurt afterwards. i will not tell M. he knows nothing about Eevy, and would ruin this for me completely. I don't need that and he doesn't need to know.   Got a phone call from my father. Also very weird. I think he was drunk. It has to have been that. He is never that happy. He told me 5 times to write him... and Dawn  from Ireland, and talked a whole bunch about how to go about homeschooling, so I'm assuming Dawn has a kid. He even laughed, he cracked jokes. That mike is the mike of my childhood, not the mike i've known these past 6 years. anyway everything seemed a little out of whack yesterday.   Watched the meteors night before last. Beautiful.   M's aunt said we can share his tent...wow. The first time i've been given permission to sleep with him. she's like well she's going away for a while so they'll want to ahve some time together, they can share the tent but I don't want to hear anything. Now I feel pressured, and I don't want to feel that. I want to still have a say in whether I want to or not. Whether I just want to sleep with him or  sleep   with   him . We'll see.    So I dont' think I will  be updating very much. Maybe I'll get a chance in Dublin or Galway. If not then I will be back on the 5th of september. If anyone actually reads this blog I will gladly tell them all about my trip. I probably will even if nobody reads it.   toodles
