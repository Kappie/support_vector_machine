I know for some it is a means of escape. For others travel is just away to fight boredom. I don’t think either of those are my reasons for travel. I have been trying to decide what it is that makes seeing, the world so appealing. After a lot of thought I  recently came to a conclusion. I believe that when you create something you leave a piece or at least and  impression of your self in you creation. If this is true, when God made the earth, he left a part of Himself here. When you travel I believe, if you look hard enough, you can see God. -Driel
