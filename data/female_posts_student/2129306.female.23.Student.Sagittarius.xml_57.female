Nothing really new to report, except that life is remarkably drama-free.  One of my neighbors was found dead this weekend-it was really freaky, and very sad to hear about-he was a really nice guy.  It appears to be natural causes-they're doing an autopsy.  He had epilepsy, but they're not sure if that had anything to do with it.    Anyway-not much new to report, I'll let you know when more exciting stuff is going on. More later...
