He looks kinda different--paler and with shorter hair than I remember.  I saw him looking at me too so I think he recognized me.  I always feel awkward when I run into Berkland people, and seeing Dennis was no exception. He was with a girl too, so I wonder if he's dating her (secretly). Seeing him there was a bit distracting. I bet he felt awkward too. Just like when I saw Aaron and Roger at Crepeville and we didn't say anything to eachother--not that I expected them to come up to me. I haven't heard from Alison in a long time.  When I called her up to study together, she gave me kind of a lame excuse.  I thought that was strange because she was very eager to study with me just the week before.  I wonder if Alice unni and Susanna SMN told her not to talk to me anymore because they saw me with B at the airport. I wouldn't be at all surprised, especially if they saw us making out in the parking lot. If they really did tell her not to talk to me anymore, they probably don't think I would be a good influence on her. Even so, I think they still care about me though. It's been three years since I've left the church and yet I still think about the five years I spent with them and how much it shaped who I am.   Found out today from Jon and Karyn that Josh is engaged!  Wow, and he's only 22 years old. I heard he proposed to her two weeks ago when she came to visit. He's been dating Tracy for 5 years, though, I guess since the beginning of college.  I heard he bought her a phat diamond ring with 3 stones because she's kind of a "girlie girl".  As if really feminine girls wouldn't settle for anything less than a big engagement ring... I've never met Tracy, but I can say that Josh is mature for someone his age, so I'm happy for them.  Couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy though... It must be hard for them since she's in Arizona and he's here.  I say this like I feel sorry for them, but at least she's in the Western US.   I'm nervous about starting the work week (as usual). Tomorrow will be busy since I will probably pick up 2 appointments. I just want to make it through one more week. It's not that I don't enjoy it, but this rotation has been incredibly draining and stressful.  I hope it will be easier my senior year. All I want to do is to see B and to hang out together. I think his anxiousness to see me is catching on and I'm beginning to feel restless as well.  My heart has been feeling achy lately, even to the point where it's harder to talk to him because I just want to see him. I feel more and more than talking on the phone is so inadequate compared to spending time together. By "spending time", I don't just mean making out, but just going everywhere together like running errands. I think anxiety about work is compounding my anxiousness to see B, so I think I will feel much more content after this week is over. If I'm lucky, I won't have to be on call this weekend since we have 2 new students joining our group. *sigh*   Cheese has been feeling restless too since Ben is gone.  Maybe he's been more affectionate with me b/c he's afraid that I'm going to give him away too if he's not a good boy.  I wonder if they're going to hug when they're reunited next weekend.   My heart literally hurts because I miss B so much. I just want it to be July 28th already. 16 more days...
