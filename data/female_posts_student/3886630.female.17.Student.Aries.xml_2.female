Anger affects your attitude towards everything or can increase in the thing(s) that an individual despises the most; anger seems to have a tendency of misguiding the views of an individual. Anger can lead to violence, a very wicked and detestable deed that a person does when he/she is not merciful to his/her enemy(-y + ies = enemies) or his/her debtor(s). Anger can also stem off into other sins and other bad impulses; like Jealousy, pride, vengeance, etc.       Jesus said:  "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." And in the prayer of Our Father (The Lord's Prayer):        "Our father who art in Heaven, Hollowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil (the evil one, Satan). Amen."        When you do not forgive your enemies and/or try to get back at them, you will not receive any mercy from God, only those that show mercy to anyone will obtain forgiveness.       Also Jesus said;  "What you do unto others, you do unto me!"      Meaning that what ever you do to anybody you also do to God.... So it is wise keep your anger down and be merciful while you can, for there might not be another day.       How to control your anger/What to do:       Turn from your wicked ways, for hate in a man's heart is a sin; which is entirely EVIL! Pray to God to forgive you and give you another chance, pray also to Him to help you in your life. He will help, not only believe that he can, also trust and have faith in him! Your life can become much better from there as you keep praying and have faith in God! I know it is not easy, but with God's help and you wanting to change and also trying will work.   God Bless You who ever you are, God is with you on every step of the way!      List of People in the Bible (Examples):      Cain:  When Cain saw that God liked his brother, Abel's offering more, Cain became envious and very angry. Cain murdered Abel and left him. God saw this and cursed Cain that he could never grow good crops and he made him be vanished away from his home forever. God left a mark on Cain's forehead so that every living thing would know what he'd done. Cain made a family in the land named Nod, which meant "Wandering".      Moses:  When Moses saw the Hebrew people worshipping Bel, Moses broke the Ten Commandments because he was infuriated by their wicked deed of idolatry (worshipping another God). Moses' chastisement for breaking the first laws of God given to Hebrews was he would pass away before they reached the Promised Land (The Land of Milk and Honey).    Also remember, it is God that helps give you control, not yourself!
