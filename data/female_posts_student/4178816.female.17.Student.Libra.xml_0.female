I wanted to cry, i wanted to explode, like a  tiny gas filled balloon poked by a sharp needle. I’m a victim of love which i never really wanted it just came and HIT me HARD....so hard that i can't move.. i can't breathe    It's 12:45am but my eyes won't shut down, still I can't believe and still I think of the love i've lost...YOU....the person whom i loved with all that i am, was finally out of reach. I never knew that giving all is not enough, It's hard to find happiness and constantly give it BUT it's harder to let go of the feeling which serves as your cane in this lifetime journey.     I never knew that the love that dominates me for a couple of years was killer it made me feel ill..it made me feel weak..My strength have run out and i have lost the meaning of life..I have lost you   It's hard to remove all the memories.... it runs in every inch of me from my veins thru my spines...from the tons of morning messages to the excitement of being together plus the joy of killing time in all those amusement parks...These moments won't definitely won't fade out It's the biggest part of my totality.     Goodbye is painful it's not easy to blurt it out but i rather say goodbye than seeing you unhappy and un-contented for the rest of my life ..I'd rather feel the pain that your memories have caused rather than to live with the suffering which your eyes express    Im willing to let you go with no pretensions no hesitations no hatred....but I’m hurting....I love you and always will be...Thank you for the memories... ***may you be blessed,and find true happiness*** ***may feel loved, even in the rare places*** ***may you live, with your own choices***
