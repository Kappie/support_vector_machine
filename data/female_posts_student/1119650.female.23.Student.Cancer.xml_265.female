My next tattoo will be my astrological sign.  ii)  For the first time in 3 years I am having a birthday party and I have awesome loving friends with which to celebrate.  Similarly I do not have a boyfriend on my birthday for the first time in 6 years so maybe this is why I am actually gonna enjoy my birthday.  iii)  20 years ago on my birthday the Mianus River Bridge collapsed at 2 a.m.  iv)  I share my birthday with the likes of Gilda Radner, Mel Brooks, Pat Morita (yes, Mister Miyagi!), John Elway, Henry VIII, John Dillinger and John Cusak.  v)  Every year for my birthday I wish for a good boyfreind.  This year I've decided to stop wishing and hoping and have decided to wish for a year of fun times with my friends.  Oh yeah and since I forgot yesterdays thursday eyecandy, I'll give it to you today.  Its someone close to my heart and I know Aidan is only a character he plays, but he's still sexy....John Corbett:
