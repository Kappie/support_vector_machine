Well, Maine was as usual not much to do weekend...ugh...and of course WE HAVE 2 go every SINGLE weekend!! Because, even if the weather is bad "it's till 'relaxing' " Quote on quote mom. I spent my nights swimming in the pool and listening to the band, and listening to the neighbor's POLICE radio...its reallllyyy cool cause u can listen to whats going on around the town, on the ocean, and in the airplanes, like they have the Coastguard, the Police, the Ambulances, firetrucks, and the army plane things so its cool cause u could hear like who was hurt and accidents and such! Its really fun, and I want one really bad, but its like $$$200$$$...YiKes!   Sooo we were driving home and this traffic was sllow and it was just on a side road n we were like wat the f?
