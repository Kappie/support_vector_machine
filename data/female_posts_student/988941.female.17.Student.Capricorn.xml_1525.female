Was a very good, powerful play set in the trenches in the first world war. Phenomenal acting and suchlike. Good lighting... they managed to make it look like the entire room was lit by one tiny little candle in the centre, and a few lamps. Sound was good, right at the end the sound of explosions were so loud that you could  feel  it as well as just hear it. A woman behind us was crying at the very end, that's how powerful it was.  When do the Brazil people come back? We reckoned it was next Wednesday. When's everyone going on holiday, where and for how long? I'm going to Cornwall next Saturday for a week, woo :)  How is everyone's summer going? How does it compare to past summers?  Finally, I've been having an idea recently that next summer, if we can, we should all go away somewhere for a couple days. It will probably never happen, but tis a nice thought
