Back in 1986, I was a travel escort and traveled to China, so her outfit is THE REAL THING. And  urlLink  Melanie   went back to the 60's.  Groovy...........  I am not a very big fan of Vampires, witches and devils.  On my side, I went to my surgeon to get my staples (all 37 of them) removed.  It was funny because I STILL have no feeling on my skin.  Tomorrow I go back to get the stiches removed.  I have my moments.  The mornings are so hard because I can't sleep on my tummy and at night, well, I have my day to hurt me.  So on this, I miss my friends lots and ................Be Good  I know that my pictures are really bad quality, I still have no idea how to fix it yet.   *(*^^%$ My comment thingny is on the fritz again
