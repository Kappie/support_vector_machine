The test in History was okay until I started the essay.  I babbled for four pages and know she'll give it back to me saying I didn't "anaylze the topic enough."  Lunch was good becuase "mean lunch lady" gave me alot of fries today!  wOOt (  My mom and I went to Best Buy tonight.   I was asked how I was six times sometimes twice by the same guy.  I didn't have a problem with telling them I was fine because they were cute.  Kudos to Best Buy for hot CD sellers.  So yeah, got some CDs and dropped a bunch of money ( "dropped" I have know idea what I was thinking when I used that word)  I forgot to say yesterday that Anna and Michelle made cheerleading so YEA!  for them.  They were so happy it was hard not to smile right along with them.    I'm lovin' the nice weather.  My car doesn't love the warm weather but I do so blah to the car.    Until tomorrow... ~Kay
