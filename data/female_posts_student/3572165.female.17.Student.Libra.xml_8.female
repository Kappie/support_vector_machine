Burke (1902-89), and J. David Grey (1935-1993), JASNA has grown to 4,000 members. About 550 of us gather in October for our three-day-long Annual General Meeting, which is located alternately between east and west coast cities in the U.S. and every fourth year in Canada. Our members also participate in year-round meetings hosted by any one of our 60 regional groups, which you will find listed on this webpage, along with information about our dues. Meeting topics vary from literary discussions to Regency dancing, biographical and historical study of Austen and her times to the study and play of such Regency games as Whist and Speculation. Our interests in topics relative to Austen are as unlimited as Austen's interests.  ty of North America.
