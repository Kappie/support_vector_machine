I didn't want to go back to Diaryland again. Though it's wonderful... I've been there. And written. And what I've read of my own diary eats away at the remaining influence I have over my mind. Like mold on old food. Hopefully, my entries will suit me better here. Like good wine, instead of bad cheese.   Not that I ever liked wine.   My paper journal is too open for some things... And I know that nobody will read this. Nobody that I don't wish to. If I cover my tracks. Since of course, it's on the internet, the source of all usless information, the source of endless streaming people, nobody will read it, right?   Anyway. This journal is about loving Erich.   Who is Erich now. Erich is a boy from Yellowknife. And I am in love with him. And whenever I think about that... I get this happy-warm feeling and a nagging thought at the back of my mind.   The nagging thought says I've deceived myself. That I'm being a stupid little girl and making a fantasy in my head, just like when I was little and would pretend to be strong. You see, I've never met Erich. Only over Messenger and email have I talked to him.   But I... No matter what that little thought says, no matter how much it ruins that happy-warm feeling... I am in love with Erich.   Sage
