Joes  where i got neeeew shoes!!!!!  they are awesome   they're Rod Lavers  they were half of of $60   but i had to pay for them  they are white and tan and dr. blue  they are sooooo cool  and then i tried on some underarmour shirts because marc and eric have been bugging me to try them because they are really great for sports since they keep you warm and are like really really tight so they don't restrict you  anyway...i loved them sooooo much!! they are so comfy and soft   but one shirt was like $35 so i didn't get one........because soccer season isn't for another 3 months  then we went to walmart  where i got some really tasty fries  and my sister was looking at all this neat mary-kate and ashley stuff so was like sitting in the middle of the girls section eating fries  it probably looked really weird  and then my mom was like looking for jewelry because it's soooo cheap there and she just wanted some she didn't have to care about so she's like "taylor pick me out some jewelry, you know all about it..."  so i was like ok!!  we got her some pearls, a gold necklace (very plain) and a detailed silver one.. so she can layer so that's she's en vogue  then i got a thumb ring that says "#1 Dad" on it   it's pretty awesome and i got these sweet Jackie O. glasses for only 4 bucks  they are like huge circles   i look so hip!  j/k  then i got a pink belt with polka dots on it for only 4 bucks  walmart is soooo cheap  then my dad was in the mens section and i found this shirt that was a 4X it was soooo big  so i put it on of course!  it came down to almost my knees and the sleeves were like too my wrists  it like a dress!!  i wanted to get it but then my dad was like "you'll never wear it" and i wouldn't ever wear it so i left it...  then i wore my glasses to this other store and ppl were like looking at me funny  it was cool  then we came home and i watched tennis, 1st match was : Ferdero vs. Kuerter  kuerter won  then it was S. Williams vs. some really bad chick  and Williams won  her match was 6-0, 5-4  haha  then i watched V. Williams vs. another really bad chick  her match was 6-1,6-2  yeah  then i was doing the dishwasher right? and i kept hearing all this like thumping and squeaking and grunting down the hall by the shoes  so i was like 'ugh stupid cat"  so i went down there and he had his head in my dad's shoe   and so picked him up and tossed him to the side and i looked in his shoes and there was like this tail wiggling around everywhere  so i ran upstairs to my sister who was in the laundry room hanging up clothes and i was like (in my shout whisper voice, because my parents were sleeping) "ZOEY THERE'S A MOUSE IN DAD'S SHOE!!!!!!!"  so then i ran to my parents room and i woke them up and my dad comes to his shoe and looks in it and he's like "what the heck"  then he stomped the shoe!!!!!!!!!  because mice like eat everything and they have diseases  then he threw it out and it was a baby chipmunk  then we all felt really bad...  wah poor thing  then my mom and sister were like "hey wasn't jasper chasing something around LAST NIGHT???!!!!"  oh ew that chipmunk had been in our house since yesterday  doing who knows what...  oh ew oh ew OH EW  MLS soccer in an hour!
