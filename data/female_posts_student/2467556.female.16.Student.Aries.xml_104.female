Sports Update: Coppell beat Carrolton/FB 3-0 amazingly.  We had poor puck movement and could hardly hold onto it.  But we won it anyways, so oh well.  Coppell goes onto play Plano West for Metroplex Champion at 8:30pm in Frisco.  I would list out the state schedule for you kids, but its too confusing so i figure i should wait until after the results for Metro.  Stars lost AGAIN to Colorado.....after we scored the first goal too.  They lost 5-2.  So now Colorado leads the series 2-0 and the stars still think they can win.....lol thats funny.  So now the only reason i'm watching is to see my Niko's final games of the season and possibly as a Dallas Star since it is probably inevitable that they will trade alot of people if we don't make it far.  Dallas plays Game 3 tonight at 7pm on Espn....anyone want to pull bets?  6 days until my birthday and i can drive!!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
