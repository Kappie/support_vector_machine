You were always too nice,  I should have thought twice,  How could I have known,  My infatuation was full-blown,  You flirted with someone else,  Yet you kept taking off your belts,  Maybe you thought I wouldn't mind,  But obviously I'm not that blind.   We broke up after not too long,  but I kept hearing all your songs,  It was so hard to forget everything,  then my phone started to ring,  You said how you missed me,  but you only wanted to kiss me,  Soon kissing didn't satisfy you,  I tried some things that were new   I gave in and did things I didn't want to,  Then you told me we were through,  I wouldn't have minded to be friends,  but you brought it all to an end,  Acquaintences is what you wanted to be,  I guess maybe now you can be free,  So tell me, what are we left with now?  This is my last goodbye,  --Ciao
