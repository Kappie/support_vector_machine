Think of a big animal and imagine it twice as horrible   My pet doesn´t bite, it munches you out of your hand      Can you hold my monster?   Can you can you?      A ravenous fire warmnesses his limbs   His breath burns, his vista is dead and cold   My monster is blind, it tramples everything down   When it unsnaps, are you maybe gonna say Stop?      Do you see the sharp paws?   Do you see the teeth?   Do you hear the snarling deep inside of his stomach?   I see your legs are trembling -   just to mention -    when I notice that then my monster notices it, too      Can you hold my monster?   Can you can you?"   (the original german text you can also find on their homepage above)
