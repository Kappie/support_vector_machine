Laura: i am laura who is not queer okay maybe a little bit. my sister is in a big stress  with me . i kinda was a bit annoying . then she tried to kill me (that'll keep katie happy) For katies sake- she did it with the doorstop.  hello everybody . when i walk home i get blown away by the wind and one day a crashed in to the loony bin they tried to shove me into a white jacket thing but i got away. I was out in the wetted and the blow or for izzys sake, the bletted and the woe.izzys obssessed with invisble raisins it was funny at first but now its just scary. I think invisable raisins are evil.
