I'm gonna write an Alias story that's a spin-off of "Work and Play" "Love and Hate" and I'm obviously gonna continue with another STFBE fanfic continuation of those two. I have soo much fun writing! And now I get to write about my fav show too??  Awesome!    Oh... and I just mowed the grass for the first time. Kinda lame-sounding but it seemed like an "entering manhood" ritual or something. Heh... if it was, my bros soo didn't pass. I had to mow their parts too cuz they were so messy. Girl Power!!
