Today, the Illinois Brass Band was there, so we listened to them for a while. Quite a talented bunch. Anyways, that was all I did! So, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to watch  Finding Nemo  now.     Last song I listened to:   Appalachian Spring Suite  by Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.    Last album I listened to:   Copland - Appalachian Spring .    Last meal I ate:  Um. Some crackers and salami, if that counts as a meal.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  We listened to the Illinois Brass Band today at the Botanic Gardens.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.    Last person I talked to:  Dan.    Favorite song today:   Rectifier  by RA.    Favorite food today:  Don't know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Went to the Botanic Gardens.   Funniest thing that happened today:  A tour guide who pronounced the 's' in Illinois and said "warsh" and "hawrthon." Ugh. Improper grammar, misspellings and mispronunciations are my pet peeve :P.
