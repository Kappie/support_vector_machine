I jumped out of bed, pulled on some of Josh's old gym shorts and ran across the street to water the neighbor's flowers and feed the cats. It was like 9:45. Then I came home, had coconut cream pie for breakfast and watched Saved By the Bell reruns. After that I took my shower, and then ten minutes later I was ready for whatever may come today. Yet, for some reason, I wasn't as frustrated as I was last night. And good ol' unorganized me sat down to make a list of my things to do today:  lay out clothes for packing hair cut ortho appt. discipleship with Daniella clean room clean bathroom meet for dance team (early with derek) FIND COSTUME FOR DANCE TEAM  The last one has been a major problem and issue of stress since about 7:30 last night. Ashley was supposed to find us costumes, I mean, honestly, I trusted her with my waist size... and then yesterday she told me that I was going to have to figure my costume out on my own. I wanted to lean over the bus seat and be like "oh, and when exactly do you expect me to do that eh? Saturday I have to pack, and I'm busy from 2-10 and Friday I'm spending with my family and Sunday I have to spend with God so I don't freak out in Costa Rica (since, if you don't recall, I will be down there for a MONTH!) and tomorrow I have cleaning to do! would have been nice if you could have given me some more notice." But you know me, I didn't say anything.   And I got up this morning expecting to run around like a little chic with her head cut off. But God was just like "hey, this is my thing ok? you let me handle it all."   Whew. Good to know someone up there has things under control. Cause I sure don't.
