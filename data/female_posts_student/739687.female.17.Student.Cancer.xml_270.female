It's like God is punishing me and laughing as he watches me fall and crumble into pieces. But I'm sure in the "God" perspective of things, I'm as good as dead and burning away in hell. It just doesn't seem fair. Life isn't supposed to be like that. If it really is God punishing me like this, then I'd rather he leave me alone. If it meant that I wouldn't be miserable, then fine. But the fact is that everything is crushing me. And at the worst possible time. A week ago, everything seemed great. I was at a peak. I was happy, things were going great, everything was in anticipation of good things; everything was looking forward to summer. It took only days to knock me down, and only a few more to shatter me. I'm just waiting for the point where I completely break apart into a million unrestorable pieces.  I hate this life. It seems as though any life I choose ends up for the worst. Maybe I'm too optimistic and not realistic enough. Or maybe I'm just not intended for anything good.  I honestly feel completely hopeless.  I guess that's just how life is, crazies. Too much drama.
