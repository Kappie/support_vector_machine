A new beginning for tomorrow! yeah. reborn once again. love this feeling. hohohohohoho. i'm gonna erase all the unhappy stuffs in my head. gonna go thru the usual routine AGAIN. haha.   i talked to riz online this evening. phew...he's ok. was worried he'll be very pissed off with me. thank god. was happy... However... i realized he's pissed off with 'someone'. not zin...but someone, his so-called buddy,X. riz thinks X interfered his life too much. i'm really worried conflicts may arise between them once again. i told riz X's trying to help him no matter wad. and that X treats riz like a buddy, that's y. really worried riz will argue with X. *keep my fingers crossed* pray that everything will be fine. all i wish for is to resolve the current problems and prevent more from arising. i know it's gonna be hard...but i know i have to go thru it. it hurts to see ppl around me leaving one by one or getting involved in many problems...just have to make sure i'm not there making things worse. yep yep. better stop bringing this damn thing up. haha.  my health is deteriorating...my cough is getting from bad to worse. gee. have to see a doctor tmr. MEDICINE...EEEWWW~~~~ no choice. it's already beyond control...the moment i breathe in, i'll cough non-stop...it's THAT BAD. argh. i'm gonna stuff myself with APPLES! an apple a day keeps the doctor away. smiles. haha. so lame. haha. hmmm...y a sudden urge wanting to eat CJ's strawberry pies eh? LOL. really damn yummy! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA... i love her butter cookies, pies, etc. hungry~~~~ *DROOL* haha.  well well...it's late. i'm tired too. so, GOOD NITE AND SWEETEST DREAMS~!!!! smiles :D
