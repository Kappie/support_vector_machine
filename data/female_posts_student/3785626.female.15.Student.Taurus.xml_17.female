I bought page 'tectors for my binder. I think I need a new binder now. I printed out all the lyrics to all the Meteora songs by Linkin Park. :) One happy camper. I haven't heard from Sharla yet, so I don't know if I'll be able to go to Jackson or not. I really don't feel up to it, but I really want to see Sharla before she leaves. She is like my sister, and I'd also see Kristian, and that is one of my sisters for real. I only seen 'em once this summer. Anyways, I'm so ready for school to start. I don't know if I'm going to act all crazy like I did at Whitten on my 2nd year, but who knows. Alot has to do with the people that go to that school. I don't like 'em. Ashley, Shirreka, Tregory, Adriano, Sam, and maybe some others are my friends. Salaste is moving, which kind of sucks. Well I'm now making pretty little band pictures. I made H.I.M. and CKY, now I'm going to do Linkin Park and a few others. Hm...who knows. Well laters. Cherry
