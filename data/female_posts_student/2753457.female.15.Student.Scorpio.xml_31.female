I need to see it again though, soak everything up another time, maybe catch a few more details.  It was one of those movies where you watch the trailer and walk in there thinking you know what's up.  Then by the time the movie is about half over, you realize that it's completely different from what you thought.  And when the credits start to roll, you just sit there and bask in your confusion and awe.  Or at least that's how it was for me.  Definitely similar type of material as in "Being John Malkovich".  Anyway, I'm not going to try to describe it much more than that.  You'll just have to see it for yourself.  (I think I like Dunst better when she's supposed to be stoned.) Well, that was definitely the highlight of today.  No doubt there. I should go study for Part II of the Greek test.  Ha, we'll see how that goes.  I still gotta figure out what I'm going to do tomorrow.  Hanna said I could ride her bus tomorrow and go straight to the show and then home, but I have a feeling I'm not going to have the time for that, especially not right in the middle of the week.  I may just have to force my mother to take me there and back.  Hmmmm.
