Funny fact:  people, practically all people, are quite vocal about their disdain for those who do not show up to events that they say they will attend.  Funnier fact: I have yet to meet someone who hasn't sold out at some time or another.  I'm sure I'm not completely innocent myself, but I make a valid effort to NOT commit to something unless I'm 110% sure I will follow through.  Those who know me well will agree that I hand out "maybe's" to invites like it's going out of style...this is generally in response to invites that don't hinder on my presence.  For instance, if two people have asured plans with each other exclusively then it is quite imperative that both parties make every effort to either show up or give the other party due notice that they will not be able to make it.  If this doesn't happen one party will end up screwed sitting alone in their apartment watching re-runs of Cheers and throwing popcorn at the tv everytime they hear the crowd shout "NORM!"  Maybe it's Victoria, maybe it's the people I know, maybe it's me....but for some reason this seems to happen to me more times than not.  I like to think that I'm a fairly decent person...I'm not a complete ass to hang out with...so I'm assuming this happens to lots of other people too.  So...a little advice....if you have plans with someone, don't just not call, or call at 10pm on Saturday night to cancel....it's not fair.  And you may not realize how hard the other person may take this.  Your reason for cancelling, be it other plans, illness, a good porno sight, whatever, has no bearing on the fact that you just screwed someone over and made them feel like shit.  If for some reason you do ditch out on someone....perhaps you may consider calling with a sincere apology and plans to make it up (which you really really should make an effort to keep unless you want to come off as a complete ditch-pig).  It doesn't matter if you ditched them and made no effort at the time to enlighten the other person as to your failure to follow through you should still call...even a week later....to let the person know you acted like an ass, and you know you acted like an ass, and the fact that you are an ass is why you didn't show up....not because there is something wrong with that other person.   Sorry if this sounds bitter...but...."do unto others...."  right?
