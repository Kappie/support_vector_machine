Hey, you have eyes MORON, use them.  Dont tell me its my fault because you tripped on the cord and knocked the laptop onto the hard tile floor and subsequently busted up the side of it. Its your goddamn fault.  grr...i hate brothers... sometimes i really wish i had sisters instead.  new years is an overrated holliday.  and i didnt get to talk to emily right before like last year, either. not that i expected to, but...it was nice.  so im pissed cause my laptop is broken and i didnt do anything worthwhile today and i still have a shitload of homework to do (not to mention that no one from my chem group has emailed me back yet. apparently theyre unconcerned about our presentation. bastards.) and i didnt do anything fun for new years and no ones online and have to wait like 3 weeks for emily to maybe sleepover which is the only frickin thing i even cared about doing this whole break. make that the only frickin thing i care about at all anymore. at least care a hell of a lot more about it than i do about anything else. and i probably shouldnt, but screw what i should do and fixing myself and everything.   maybe i should just stop caring about everything. period. and i woudlnt ever have to ask anyone for anything again. and that way i would never be disappointed. ever.  too bad i could never do that. sigh.  and i have no idea about who im going to bring down here when i finally get that chance again. theres the mind decision and the heart decision and there probably shouldnt be and hopefully reality will help me a bit in solving that but who the hell knows?  i was in a better mood earlier. hopefully i will be tomorrow. im going to bed.  at least i have bob. and that "just in case." some comfort there.
