Thanks to  urlLink Aussie Expats , I found out that the Aussie flag is on its way home:    FOUND beneath tens of thousands of tonnes of rubble and twisted steel, a soiled and crumpled Australian flag is a solemn reminder that September 11, 2001, was more than an American tragedy. Now, almost three years after 2749 people perished in New York, the Australian standard is heading home where the Federal Government will have it preserved and mounted. The Government intends to consult the relatives of the 11 Australians killed by terrorists on September 11 on how best to display the flag. Ten Australians died in New York and one in Washington.   :)  I've also found what I think will be my  urlLink Olympic news source . Woot woot!
