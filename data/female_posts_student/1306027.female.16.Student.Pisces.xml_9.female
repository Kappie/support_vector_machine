A three week long camp. *Joy* It's an academic camp but what do I care? Im academic. It's awesome in my very own special opinion. Chicago is the most awesomest city ever. Yes, that concludes my uses of "awesome".   What put my mind on camp? Well, shopping for supplies could do it. My paycheck was ultimately blown to pieces by the following purchases: An alarm, an answering machine, some makeup, batteries, a phone jack splitter, film, power strips, and several other misc. items. I will be well prepared... hahahaha. I will make others green with envy, or red. What does it matter? It will be envy. Lol.
