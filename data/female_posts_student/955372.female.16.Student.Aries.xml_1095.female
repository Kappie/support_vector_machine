Lord's a little stale today. Might want to check the date on that Lord." "I always just wanted to grab that whole bowl and run home, pour some milk on it. Have some Christ Chex. Wouldn't that be cool if there was actually a cereal called Christ Chex. 'Start your day off the Holy Way with Christ Chex." on the peace be with you thing... "When the priest is doing his 'peace' speech everyone's looking around picking out all the people they aren't going to shake hands with. Like 'psht, fuck that guy, I'm not shaking his hand. No dude I'm good, I'm shaking this guys hand. *smack* HEY I said no!'"
