He knew his parents would have already left by the time he'd arrive home so that's why he'd said his goodbyes before he'd left with his peers earlier.  His damp towel was draped around his shoulders and he carried his nearly empty bottle of sunblock in one hand, which reminded him that he'd have to ask Joel for some money to go get some more.   Joel ... Over time Damien had come to think of him as an older brother, someone to confide his deepest secrets to moreso than his own friends.  There were things in Damien's life that he would have felt embarressed discussing with his parents, but with Joel it seemed easier to talk about what was on his mind.  Lost in thought Damien suddenly found himself in front of Sweet Delight. He could see Joel inside listening to the radio and tapping to the beat. Damien knew it couldn't be Joel's preferred choice of music because the man refrained from listening to such harsh lyrics since there was a young child living there. A smile came to Damien's face as he opened the door and walked inside, causing the bell to jingle overhead and Joel to turn around.
