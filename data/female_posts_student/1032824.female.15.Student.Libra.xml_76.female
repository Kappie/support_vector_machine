" that freaking a**h*** said it so loudly and they were all cracking up then mr lee was like " see what? " all blur. my gosh, i swear i could've kicked wenxings balls then. *grr!* so paiseh..  The entire BBQ went really well. the weather was awesome and everything went on smoothly although there was an excess in food. wenxing was so frustrated cos' he couldn't cut the stingray! haha! cut until the knife BENT! another hilarious scene was while preparing food before the rest arrived, mr lee tried to cut the corn using the knife and the corn was flying all over the place! he didn't succeed in cutting them so i was like, "you don't help out in the kitchen at home do ya?" and he was like "yaa!" with a grin flashed across his cheeks. haha!  We had a "moon-tan" and caught up with one another. geetha, karen, eileen, peiwen, dingling, gerry and i tried to push our girlfriends down * eh hem * while strolling at the edge of the pool. haha! mission unaccomplished though, and gerry and geetha slipped and fell on their butts!  oouuccch!!  we all broke out in laughter. tehee. those poor lil' souls who fell on their butts.  Mr Lee had chats with all of us and we kept asking him about his sons. so we finally went upstairs and i think he asked his son to come out...but he was all shy, and so were we. so never talk to him. * aww ..* but he is   really  good-looking . he has the  ACS(I)+outdoor sporty+smart+skater  look. very cheeky face too. (btw, he skates! so hip hop rite?) and according to ruth, he is in ACS(I). so like, wow, ellidegable bachelor huh? but seriously jess, he's much cuter than your  tuna ! keke..just kidding. don slaughter me.   After a looooong day, daddy picked ruth, dingling, yulun and i up at about 10pm..sooo exhausted! keke, if you're interested to see some of zee photos, click  urlLink HERE ! haha. had heaps of fun and we have to thank Mr and Mrs Lee for this awesome party. =D  So long mates! tata!
