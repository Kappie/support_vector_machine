Have you ever wondered what it feels like to have no fingers? Or to no longer need to shape or comb that locks of yours? Being able to walk in being unnoticed, with nobody paying special attention or giving stares that could hurt an individual for life?  Yet he still stand strong, with dignity, faith and forgivness. In a court testimonial, 18 years after that tragic accident, he told the driver that he has no hatred, for   hatred only brings misery  . How true and touching. His apperance and life were moulded in hands of a stranger he never met, someone who had altered his route so drastically yet isn't someone he knew of. And to be able to forgive the man who robbed the chance of living a normal life was indeed a tremendous deed that needs more than just courage.    I have everything   some people longed and are deprived of.  Little things in life that are frequently neglected and overlooked.  The world is full of many such people like Joel. Those who do have everything a simple life grants,   reflect and realise how lucky you are in other's eyes.     Sometimes, money isn't everything that makes the world go round.
