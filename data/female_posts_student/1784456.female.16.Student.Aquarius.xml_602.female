They're gone! :'( But it's okay cause I'll probably see them on Friday and go to the pub! Yeay! But then I won't see them for another three years! Noooo! Hmm... they're fun though but I can talk to Lucy on AIM which none of you lot have... apart from Laura! Yeay! I was talking to loads of people, some one got their hair died blonde (another light bulb head to add to the collection) and some one else got their hair shaved off and it was really nice and long before! Geez, it was a hair day! Some one was saying how the holidays were freedom for hair... geez, they really get in contact with their inner yang of hair don't they? Oh no I forgot to tell them that it was dead! Yeay people talked on msn and I went all hyper and talked to absolutly every one! Well I betta go, remember apron!
