Had summer school....the usual, then I went to my trumpet lesson and definitely got lost on the expressway, how one does that, I'm still not sure, but I found my way there and back. :) Weeee. Good times. Then, I did end up going to Ribfest with a bunch of people. It was Lindsay and her family, Mike Klos, Anna Hannah, this german girl who we met up with there who used to know Lindsay when she came here last year for the jazz trip and Peter. Whoo. It was fun. We saw Sugar Ray. I liked them. I thought they were good. I just enjoyed myself. I try to enjoy myself in any situation. Even with that AWFUL movie last night. Hehe. Then, Anna, Peter and I all went to baker's Square. I'd never been there. I wanted to get something but I was so full. I had a big dinner and then, I finally had my first elephant ear. It was yummy. But, I'd have to say the one thing I'll remember from tonight was Peter blaring Spanish music with the windows down on the way to Baker's Square. GAH. I was seriously going to smack him over the head. I love him though. He's a good kid. It was nice hanging out with them. I've missed them.   And now, I'm SUPER tired and I must be off to sleep. And...this is for a certain someone. She'll know who she is...once ya blog ya just can't....drat, it doesn't work. :) I'm so tired I'm hitting the highlands...awww, I miss Brett. I want him to come home. The highlands always make me think of him. Come home Brettholomue!!! :)
