How far are you supposed to trust people on the net without being gullible? (or gullable I guess) Ahh I'm not really a 500 pound gorilla! I'm a 30 stone teapot! Hmm not many job opertunities open to me then I guess. We got all out GCSE predicted you're gonna get this grade or your conscience will kill you grades back and I did ok! Yeaaay! Only two grades to up and then I'm gonna be an aaa student! Woohoo! Mind you a baaa student would be quite cool. (Probably end up being a baaab) Then onto AS and A2 levels! (Gyaahhh!) I did some Japenese drumming today! Cool man! It was soooo much fun but I forgot the name of the cool group who are performing in England and are 'world class'. We also did some gamelan, which is also loads of fun! Ahh but I wanted to play the gong! The Japanese drummer guy came in and started hitting the gongs (shows what he loves!) Gamelan:  urlLink http://www.joglosemar.co.id/gamelan.html  I was playing a saron! I love all these other culture things, I wish I could join a group or something... Japenese Drumming:  urlLink http://www.kuenstleragentur-karinkaiser.de/tte_tai.htm  Yes, the links really do have to be that obvious. I'm one of those people who spends about five minutes on a splash page trying to get in!
