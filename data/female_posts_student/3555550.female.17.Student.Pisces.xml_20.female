I want to see A Clockwork Orange SOOO bad, but I don't feel like seeing it by myself (which is unusual in itself. usually i'm like: fuck off! I'm watching a movie!). And I decided to skip the Tilly and the Wall concert tonight. *tear* I hope everyone there rocks out for me. I just didn't feel like doing that alone either (I got cancelled on by a sick Kelsey this morning).   For once, I ACTUALLY want company. And not because I want to bitch...because I want to have some god damn fun! I never have fun! I want to light something on fucking fire and then chase people with it.  Or smoke.  and I never smoke (except at concerts...and it's only around people who I know won't tell me 'stick up the ass' friends).  I just feel crazy.  And NO ONE IS BLOODY HOME.  Fuck my friends and their work schedules. Damn Damn Damn.  And I'm done...
