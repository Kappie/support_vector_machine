Life was too perfect right then to be able to look ahead and see the pain and sorrow that could come. That made me think. So often I want to know what is going to happen in my life and why it is going to happen that way. Sometimes I think, oh, if I had only known that life would go this way I would have ________. But I know it isn't true. I would have panicked if I had seen how life would go. And it is better this way, not to know what is coming so that you can live each day as it comes. If we knew exactly when we would die, we would live around that day. Or if we knew we would have a car accident one day we would all stay inside.  I have big dreams. I know that all of them will not succeed. But I still try to make them all succeed and to reach for them as far as I can. Once again the American life calls. But this time in a good way. An extra day of waiting tables so I have to go and leave with short incomplete thoughts as always.
