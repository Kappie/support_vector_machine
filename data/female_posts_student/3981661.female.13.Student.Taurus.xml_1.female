But then I found out you have to pay and download it :'( maaaan it looked so much fun :(   Oh well.   Last night was really funny. I found these mini final fantasy stories someone had made up xD they were sooooooooo so funny xD xD And then Jazz added this guy Max into our convo, and I said alot of weird stuff, like mooo, weeee and don't mess with me I'm one crazy mofo. The he said blingage for some reason. ..... LMFAO!!!!! blingage xD xD xD I was laughing so much, I forgot that I had loads of water in my glass, I thought I only had a littlebit left. So I tipped the glass back really quick and spilt it all over my trousers xD xD xD xD lmfao   It was funneh ^-^   OH YEAH. I got another tenchi book yesturday too. Yey! Now I have 7 manga books :O:O:O   *does celebration dance*   And I found this nice dress up site. Then I found AN AMAZINGLY COOL OUTFIT *points down*   I shall name her Kito (for I had already made up someone like that, and this looked so cool I changed the story) ^______^ Kito has no last name cause she is cool :o also, Kito is a bad ass. Fighting, helping people mess up other people,you get the picture ^-^
