NOW I HAVE TO BLOG AGAIN :'(  ok. what was i saying? ah yes. i wrote that i havent blogged in a while. so i was saying what i have done since i last blogged. on sunday, went to that lil picnic.. fell asleep the entire time, then derrick poured cold water on me. after that, me, terry, malc, michael ui, and randy went to the theaters. we watched i,robot and spidey-man 2. both were SUPERB movies!! i got home around 1:15 =D anyways, next day i went to the dentist. i had a cavity, and got it filled. yay. it hurt =( anyways, after we got back from the dentist, i went out to metro with leanna, ra-ool, davis, jorge, jorge's cousin, shan, and terry... we ate out at boston pizza.. [little known fact to me: corona tastes like shiznit] after that, we went to playdium and yeah it was fun. AIR HOCKEY!! yay!! after that, we left, took the skytrian home, and yeah. said bye-bye to terry n ra-ool, and then the rest of us got off and me n davis said bye-bye to leanna coz she left yesterday for new york and yeah anyways, after that davis briefly tried to teach me how to drive standard. that way to drive seems cool, but arghness i must've stalled about 50 times... but whatever it was davis's fault. after that, i found ou that sparkling grapefruit is my new favourite drink... =P i got home around 11:20, and then we talked for a bit... [msn smiley ^o)] hahaha. anyways, i slept around whatever. i was tired. next day, ra-ool came over.. well, actually, he came over AFTER i FINALLY cleaned my room!! and THEN ra-ool came over!! we played video games.... OLD SCHOOL NINTENDO!! double dragon II, ninja turtles, and of course, SUPER MARIO BROS 3!!! after that, we sang along with music for like 2 hours almost i would say. BACKSTREET BOYS!!! "show me the meaning of being lonely" "you are my fire, the once desire" harmonizing was so much fun!! backstreet boys all the way, eh, ra-ool??!! after that, we rented movies, some movie i cant remember what its called but yeah it was pretty funny!! that night, eddy, bryce, and kaylee slept over coz we went BERRY PICKING TODAY!! davis tagged along too, but no thanks to him and bryce, we got "kicked out". coz davis n bryce weren't picking properly. they like just went ahead of everyone and just picked like crazy and the dude told them like 5 times or whatever coz they weren tpicking properly/thoroughly, and they werent like picking off the ground. yeah. so i only got $6. =( oh well. s'all good. after berry picking, we were bored, and bought pizza from d-hut pizza plus aka DHALIWAHL-HUT pizza plus, as me n bryce named it. the pizza smelled like the b.o. of east indians. it smelled like their food or whatever. anyways, the whole way back from macs to my house, me n bryce were talking with east indian accents "thank you come again" etc it was hilarious. we were laughign so hard. YEAH!! it was awesome. the pizza was arite, nutt'n special, kinda mehh. but i didnt really eat any. coz i wasnt hungry. anyways, today was a long day. im bored... tired... and i needa fold laundry...   question of the day: out or NOT out??
