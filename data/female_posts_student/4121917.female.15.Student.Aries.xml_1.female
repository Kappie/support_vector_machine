Or do I visit you every sunday and we go to the park or get something to eat? Am I welcome to come to your aniversary? Will you still think of me the way that you do now? How i wonder Will you even remember me, even just walking down the street? I would like for you to at least think of me every once in a while And if it's just a passing thought I hope it's one that could bring a smile to your face I want you to think that I have always adored you Cause i always did I want you to think of me and remember how you trusted me with anything that you had to say I would like you to think that it was really important for you to have known me And having me in your life made you feel blessed Always knowing that I cared about you And as far as friends go I really do consider you the best Cause I know that I will think of you in the years, and maybe the next century to come And I will always remember a beautiful creature that came and did loving wonders to my soul Irreplaceable memories will always come up of us and all the little things we do Warming me up with some medicine...I don't knowI guess that I just want to say thank you Thanks for being alive Thanks for being my friend   DAMN WAYNE I LOVE U BRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
