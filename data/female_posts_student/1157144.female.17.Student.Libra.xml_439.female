Just be happy you will be there with chicks, away from parents, and will have already tapped that sweet ass known as TASHA! BTW, I am doing major SAT studying for my previous low grade and will be trying to use bigger and newer words to help me with my vocab.  If I happen to say a word incorrectly please tell me, no matter how angry and violent I may become.  Thanks! Oh yeah!  I AM WAY NERVOUS!
