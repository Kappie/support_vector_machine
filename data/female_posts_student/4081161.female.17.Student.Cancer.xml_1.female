I established this so people I know can see what I'm up to without actually having to ask "how are you?" thus saving time, energy, and sanity. I'm not the concise verbal type, so you can sympathize the innocent fool who actually does ask "how are you?" and gets slammed by a three hour speechpertaining to the injustices that are caused in the world, what sort of injustices are caused, and why the people who cause these injustice need to be neutered.        I'm not sure how often I'm going to post, but it will be fairly frequent. It will mostly be about nothing or weird thoughts that I have during the day. Frequency also correlates to how many people are actually reading this. If no one reads my stupid words, then what use is it  really ? So if you do  indeed  read this, please post a comment or at least tell me. Pictures might be involved somewhat. Depends really.       I forewarn you,  beware of my bizarre sense of humor quickly.  You will recieve no mercy from me whatsoever. I'll also try not to say bad words.       Otherwise, let me reintroduce myself. My name is Cristie Pirote. I'm currently seventeen-years-old. I want to have a pet chihuahua so I can name him Mr. C and a pet hamster so I can name him M.C. Hamster.I listen to rock music (like Muse, Radiohead, Stabbing Westerwards, Pearl Jam, The White Stripes... etc). I am a workaholic. I like to draw weird pictures. I like write stories. I like sleeping. I started this blog to save me from boredomwrapped in summer vacation.       "Getting-To-Know-You" hour is over.Whew. I'm glad. I was afraid we were going to start braiding each other's hair for a moment.       = Cristie   p.s. Isn't this a great change from all these weird cards/letters I've been sending you people?
