This means that the gel inside my eye pulled away from the retina (it usually happens in 50- to 70-year olds ... gee, I have "old" eyeballs) and I will have a permanent blind spot along the periphery of my vision.  At least I wasn't using it that much :-)  There is no treatment.  I must also remain on "high alert" (now I sound like an American ;-)) for 6 weeks because there is an increased chance of retinal detachment during this period.  I'm just glad it wasn't anything more serious, and I will be checked out in 2 weeks to make sure my retina isn't weakening anywhere.  The doctor said I'd be fine to resume all normal activities and although she couldn't explain the sharp intraocular pain, she said Tylenol and ice would help.   I've continued to lay off the reading today instead opting to run around campus like a fool delivering various letters to various departments and do some much needed desk management.  The reading will start tomorrow.    More to come...
