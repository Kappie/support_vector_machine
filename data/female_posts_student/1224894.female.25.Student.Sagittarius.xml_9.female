I hope that I’ll come up with some substantial and fun information on how my day went.  	Actually today was like any other day. I woke up late at about 7:30 since I fell asleep about 12 last night. I was so tired from the late night adventure that my Mom and I went through together with a good friend.   	There’s this music that keeps playing in my head…”swept away”…hmmm…  	Anyway, in the afternoon, we went to mass for the culmination of the month of the Rosary celebration, followed by a procession. Had some halo-halo together with Ma’s friends at Barrio Fiesta and met a couple who joined us for some time.  	Chin, I hope you received my e-mail…since, you didn’t reply, this blog will keep you informed.   	Been talking to Ma about what to prepare for the Undas…we’ll probably having some sandwiches made and order a cake. Yum! Auntie Sol was here and had her blood pressure checked…(dumarami na ang aking pasyente)  	Oh well, the stars are shining so brightly tonight, beckoning for a walk along the beach…at this time? Hmmm…Kinda missed chatting, but been loving the feel of my bed too much. Was thinking of buying a web cam though, but my Ate said, she’d send her digital cam…ambot kanus-a pa sad!  	And the dogs are howling again…argh! They’re giving me the goose bumps. And another argh!, classes will start soon.   	Yesterday, I had so many good thoughts, but now, everything escaped me. I’m having a hard time writing…considering I’m quite inspired. Now, what the heck’s wrong? I wonder what new movies are out…tsk.tsk.tsk.  	I really need to get out before classes start or else, I’d be a nutcase…how does Camiguin sounds? Duh! I’ll settle for Duka Bay.  	And yes, on the 6th of November, we’ll go to Duka Bay to celebrate the Despedida party of Father Dennis who’s leaving for Hawaii on the 18th, I’ll miss him surely…he’s my confidant, sort of and a very frank (sometimes tactless) adviser. I’ll definitely have fun in Duka…white beach, glass bottom boats and snorkeling…pure heaven.
