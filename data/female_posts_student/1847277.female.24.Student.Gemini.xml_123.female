A day from now, I'll be on a plane, on my way to jolly old England, and two days from now, I'll be chillin and illin with Dave.  And three days from now... Yes, okay, this could get ridiculous.  But, humor me one last time... one week from now, I'll be in Nairobi! I'm kind of hoping that fate will smile on me and that Stan will either know someone or will himself have great materials for me to work with for my dissertation.  Although it is true that I'd really like to work in South Africa.  So, what to do?  I mean, if Stan offered me something, would I then not go to South Africa in the winter?  Or would I still go just to make contacts and maybe to start learning the fauna, even if I wouldn't be doing my dissertation there?  I guess this is kind of a counting my chickens before they hatch scenario.   Hmm.  As I type this it isn't word wrapping, but going in a really really long line.  I hope it doesn't try to post that way, because that clearly wouldn't work. Anyway, the moral of the story is that I'm very excited to be done here, because it means that I'm closer to going home, and that in two days I'll be with friends.  Yay.
