YET" (wait till school work gets intense)  I don't know why I didn't blog for awhile ... I guess I didn't find things that worth blogging for a page.  There were little things here and there that I could talk about ... so now I am writing them all at once, as a "weekly digest".    Ice Skating  I went ice skating with my roommate a week ago ... in MIT ice arena. For a long time, I refused to go skating under any circumstance, because I had a BAD experience with roller skating when I was in elementary school (my mom forced me to learn roller skating, which did not turn out well ... you see, many phobias developed in adulthood actually rooted from traumatic experience in childhood ...)  I just didn't like skating, and ice skating, of course, falls under the same category. I didn't know what came into me that day; my roommate said that she wants to go ice skating, and I decided to tag along. (Before I went, my boyfriend seriously warned me about the *danger* of skating -- from his first and last skating experience, he almost broke his arm and had to drive w/ his left hand for a month).  Somehow, that day, I just all the sudden felt ... fearless. You are probably thinking, that's a disaster waiting to happen, considering that I had never learned how to ice skate before.   Well ... it actually turned out to be a very NICE experience.  During the two-hour duration, I learned how to ice skate, though I can't quite do it as smoothly as I want it to be yet ... but I did have a lot of fun. For sure, I will go back to the ice arena, again and again, until I master my skating skills ... (ok, maybe not, maybe just to be able to skate smoothly without tripping).  Hehe ... and by that time, I plan to drag my boy friend to go ice skating with me (I sense a strong resistance) ... *evil smile*.    My roommate's Beta Fish  After posting the last blog about my roommate's Beta fish, I got a lot of concerning messages from friends/sister about the fish.   I thank you for all your concerns, and I have a good news: the Beta fish is still alive, and well.   It turned out that, this Beta fish *actually* likes cold water (my roommate called up the pet store and asked).   We had no idea why the fish doesn't eat very often ... we think the fish is on diet. =/ Well ... since it's alive and well, I guess there is no need to over-concern ourselves.  (Yeah, we were over-reacting all this time.)    Trip to California, my melancholy  This past weekend is me and my boyfriend's 5th year anniversary. =D So I decided to sneak back to San Diego, CA for one last time before IAP is over, and celebrate. (Sneak back as if ... my parents weren't aware of it).  What can I say ... San Diego is nice, as always.  60F, sunny and warm ... makes me want to cry.  I also re-visited UCSD, got to talk to some old friends and profs back home ...   On the day of anniversary, we went to a movie that I wanted to watch for a long time (even though it didn't get a good review), and we both liked it.  We took a walk in the afternoon, to the coffee shop near his apartment, enjoying the weather, sipping coffee, chatting about his work, my school work, our future plans, life in general.  At nite, we went to a fancy restaurant in downtown La Jolla, had full-course meal, and shared a dessert together -- chocolate fudge w/ fruits, nuts, and Macadamia ice cream on top. *yum*  The whole weekend was nice, and time just flew by in the blink of an eye.   I don't want to admit this, but I really do miss CA, miss San Diego.  All the sudden I am confused.  I didn't realize how much I was attached, whether towards my old life style, towards my boyfriend, or towards San Diego.  I didn't know I would miss spending time with him, or miss living in San Diego that much ... not until I have lost the opportunities.  I guess that's just human nature ... the weekend that we spent together doing *common things* that usual couples do makes me happy, even though I used to not consider those moments any special when I was in SD.
