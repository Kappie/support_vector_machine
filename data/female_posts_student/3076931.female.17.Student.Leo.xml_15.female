ANYWAYS...yesterday was the last day of SCHOOL! hell yeah. i went out to eat and then played volleyball with my cool yearbookies. we realized that we SUCK at volleyball. They're all going to the lake w/o me next week. :( last night was fun as well. Hung with my coolest homies ever! i love you guys! We did girly things and then went to sundown..which was fun! Next time tho..we're gonna be those hippie dancers we've decided..and if someone isn't having a good time, we're not gonna let that ruin it for us. We wrote all over our cars "SENIORS 2005" just cuz we're losers like that. We ended up in some random park with some random guys..and got bored with that so then went to Shakie Shake to get some FROOD. we decided to have piggy back races in the parking lot.  I have to say i am so proud of my parents. We got in at 2:53 am last night (err this morning), and my mom was even in the kitchen getting water, and she didn't care. I am SO HAPPY that they finally trust me again!! so happy!
