I will confess to not knowing very much about it (having been in a little time warp called law school for the past few months), but I will say that I think it is interesting that the only two people not to vote on the measure at all are both running for president:  Kerry and Lieberman.  My theory (and it's not very deep or original, I'm sure) is that neither one of them wants to vote against it, because the Republicans are going to use this to say that they were the ones who got prescription drug legislation through the Congress, but they also didn't want to vote for it, either for ideological reasons or in case Democrats are right, and the legislation tends to harm the elderly or turns out to be unpopular among them.  Hence, the no shows.  Or perhaps they were just too busy campaigning to bother.  Edwards, who is also in the Senate and is also running for president, did show up to vote against the measure.
