She's an "honorary assistant" so she isn't acting this year but told Kristi she'd be in this performance.  I'm also performing march 9th...or 10th, I think it's the 10th, for the public performance.  I'm kinda, or extremely I should say, nervous.  I have 2 weeks before the sinagua performance.  I don't have ANYTHING memorized and we only have 2 rehearsals before we perform.  2 rehearsals in 2 weeks...that's kind of odd.  So I'm just gonna go freak myself out about how many lines I don't know and stress myself out about letting everyone else down. Woo.  I need to sleep.
