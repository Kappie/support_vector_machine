Anytime I do something well, the next thing I do is trip on my face. It's insane.   Sure, it's funny, but it gets kind of old sometimes that every time that a crash is heard in Chemistry class everyone turns toward me as an automatic response, or that anytime a thump or crash is heard at home someone is bound to yell out, "Francesca, are you all right?"  Eh, I'll get right over it in a minute. Just a tad... [insert adjective that I cannot think of here].
