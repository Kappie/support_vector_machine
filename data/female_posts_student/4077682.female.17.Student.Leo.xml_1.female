I know it's such an unoriginal thought... but for it to really make an impact on you, you have to discover it for yourself.      There's not enought time to worry about every little thing you do.     well there was this one time... we all got really drunk (I puked 6 or 7 times... not cool, I know) and when we got to the park, I really embarrassed myself and (cough, cough I farted). yah... but there's really no time to worry about it.      When a friend of mine passed away last year, my friend amanda wrote a song with the lyrics "what if I died tomorrow, what if i died today. what if I lived in sorrow, what if i lived in pain." makes you think eh? So you really just have to keep doing things for yourself. Take some "me-time".      My friends and i all are really priviliged. We live in a good area, with good people. I mean what's the worst that's happened to us.... I lost a friend last year, my sister had a lot of troubles and it really effected my family, I've lost grandparents. but really it's nothing. Nothing that you can't move on from. nothing that will cause permanent damage.     When I was younger, my grandma lived with me. It was soooo hard. she fucking drove me INSANE. but my mom would always say, this is a test. your gonna learn from it, youll become a better, more understanding person. And the funny thing is, its true.           Mick said to me, you have to discover loss to learn how to appreciate things... or something around those lines. It's sooo true. so i guess in a way, everythings sort of meant to happen and everything is kinda a test. You can learn from everything, from your own hardships or others hardships.          so yah..... carpe diem.
