So on my long drive home from Austin today, I figured out all my favorites.  Beach:		Hawk’s Nest, St. John, USVI Color:		pale, pale, yellow Movie:		The English Patient Date:		Take-out and rent a movie Season:	        Fall Name:		Oliver and Alice Time of day:	1am-5am Food:		Caribs and Shark bites, Woody’s, St. John Mistake:	Mikki James Music Video:	Coldplay “Back to the Start” 		Gary Jules “Mad World”  I could read anything and everything by: 		Irving Stone, John Steinbeck  I want to look like: 		Charlize Theron  Most Prized Possession: 		My black books  I can listen to these CDs all the way through, over and over: 		Third Eye Blind – The first one 		Mojave 3 – Spoons and Rafters 		Blue October – The Answers  Best song lyrics ever:		Bright Eyes, “Bowl of Oranges” 	“The rain it started tapping on the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming, so I got out of it.  And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open.  Just my nightstand and my dresser where my nightmares had just been.  So I dressed myself and left then, out into the grey streets.  But everything seemed different and completely new to me.  The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body.  And each person I encountered I couldn’t wait to meet.  I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health.  I said, “I’m terribly sorry but there is nothing I can do for you that you can’t do for yourself.”  He said, “Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand.  I think that would help.”  And so I sat with him awhile and then I asked him how he felt.  He said, “I think I’m cured. No, in fact, I’m sure of it.  Thank you, Stranger, for your therapeutic smile.”  So that is how I learned the lesson that everyone is alone.  And your eyes must do some raining if you are ever going to grow.  But when crying don’t help and you can’t compose yourself, it is best to compose a poem.  An honest verse of longing or a simple song of hope.  That is why I’m singing…  Baby don’t worry cause now I got your back.   And every time you feel like crying, I’m gonna try and make you laugh.  And if I can’t, if it just hurts too bad, then we’ll wait for it to pass and I will keep you company through the days so long and black.  And we’ll just keep working on the problem we know we’ll never solve of love’s uneven remainders.  Our lives are fractions of a whole.  But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall.  Then I think we would see the beauty.  Then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges, like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.”  A few things I am not a fan of: Socks with sandals Oreos and Ketchup 4pm – 7pm Sundays “My bad”
