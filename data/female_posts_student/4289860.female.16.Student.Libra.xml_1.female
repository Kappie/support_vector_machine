Found out that I could pull very well when the pool was pretty shallow but I slowed down considerably in the middle section of the pool, which was 1.8m deep. Why? Someone enlighten me. Swum continuously for about 1/2 hr to 45mins till Mum came to call me up. I went in to have a thorough shower and then went up to the bowling alley to join Mum and Dad. Saw Keith Toh there. That guy who looks like a poly student but who actually is only 15. From ACS I think, from what I could gather from his t-shirt. Dad gave me money to have a hot cup of milo but I couldn't find the lady manning the counter so Mum said to have my milo when we reach Sun Plaza, which was around 5-10mins drive away. They went off on the 1st floor to go to Goldheart (Mum's a jewellery fan ^_^) while I stopped at the 3rd. I asked for a cup of milo and told the lady not to add so much hot water. She told her counterpart to add half hot and half cold water. Paid 90c and sat down to enjoy my drink.  Joined Mum and Dad at Goldheart after finishing my milo. She was looking at a 0.6 carat ring. I spent time examining the diamonds whilst comparing them with the chart which dictated clarity, cut and what not. One of the staff suggested I become a Gemologist (sp?) haha. Mum bought 1 ring and 1 pair of ear rings and we left to go home.  On the way home, we heard on radio that Jia Wei lost her semi-final match to that Korean what's her name. I was so upset I wanted to cry. I knew I shouldn't have placed high hopes on her but it just seemed so odd that her winning streak was broken. Watched the last game of the match during the repeat just now. It's ok though, she still has a shot at the bronze. I really hope she gets it. I think she's feeling crushed now. She knew that Singapore would be watching and she didn't want to disappoint. It's ok Jia Wei, you've done your best. You shouldn't have any regrets! Think about it, you kicked the Korean's butt 11-0 during one of the games. W.H.O.A! You still have a shot at a medal tomorrow, the bronze. Though it's not as glamorous as a silver or gold, it's still an OLYMPIC MEDAL. Not many athletes in the world even get to GO to the Games and even less win medals. It's going to be a great honour to win even a bronze. GO JIA WEI!!! I'm behind you!!! Jia you!!!  Oh yes, also got a new mouse. Figured out why my computer was crashing on me. It wasn't blogspot hah! Although I thought it was initially, but it was actually my mouse. It suddenly died and my brother threw it away. He installed the extra mouse in the house, which was so tiny it couldn't fit into the palm of MY hand. Imagine that. My hand's already the tiniest in the house. It's quite insensitive too so I'm glad I have my new mouse now. *muacks the new mouse* It's the same as the old one but it's black instead of white.  Oh well, I need to get back to my work. Sigh...I still have Assignment 12 (Techniques of Differentiation) and 4 36ji to do. Someone just kill me now.  The only bright thing of tomorrow is that we're going to try out the new Ebonite/Hammer balls. Hope I can find a really good ball haha. I've been plagued with so many problems with my current ball. Wrong ball for me. Mum was really angry Uncle Kenneth recommended me the ball. Was he trying to clear stock and thus used me as a guinea pig? =( Well, Uncle Fong's going to be there when we drill that ball so Uncle Kenneth can't screw up this time. Uncle Fong might wring his neck heeh. Training went ok today. Learnt some new stuff. Too lazy to type it here. However, only 8 people came. Andrew Yeong's apparently training with the National Youth Squad. Sounds so incredulous. Oh wells, good luck anyway. He hasn't been coming for training. Ren Yih and me are going to leave him OUT of next year's National Schools' team if he doesn't want to attend any of the trainings, no matter how good he is. I don't care. We've decided to leave the names of those who haven't been attending trainings for next year's squad.  Sigh...I hope life becomes better for me. Urgh, I'm gonna get back my common test papers on Monday. Can't stand it. I know I'll fail all. Urgh...I'll just have to work harder for the promos. I don't wanna be retained. I don't care if the TPs do. I wouldn't mind AT ALL. See how much they've offended me?  Song (I'll put this everyday if I don't forget. It's just the song I'm playing on my computer as I type out this update.): Without You - Clay Aiken and Kimberly Locke
