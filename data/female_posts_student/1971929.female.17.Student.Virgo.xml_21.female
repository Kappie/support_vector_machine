First of all, I didn't get to leave the house to pick up movies and tickets like I had planned and thus was thwarted in my effort to attend Harry Potter and escape the obese children. Then, when it came time to stuff my face with hotdogs, I was limited to three because the fat kids had to eat too. Psh. They could live without five hotdogs each. Then I talked to my friend Laura on MSN and she said she'd go with me to see Harry Potter since Talley, whom I had planned on attending the film with, had already seen it earlier in the day. So she went to pick up tickets for the 6:45 show, but they were sold out already, and so was the 7:15 showing. Then I talk to people and everyone and their mom has already seen it and they're all telling me how awesome it is, and all I can do is just sit there and feel sorry for myself. I guess I'll just see it tomorrow after the SATs. If I don't see it tomorrow, I'm going to be sad. Tear.
