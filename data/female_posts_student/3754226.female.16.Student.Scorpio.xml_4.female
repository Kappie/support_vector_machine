     
      In this world full of lies,  Blinding my innocent eyes,  Nobody heard my sorrowful cries,  I can only make a deep sigh.   Since the day that you came,  My life has never been the same,  You made my heart tamed,  Hope my love for you may remain.   I may leave my promise untrue,  But it had never made me blue,  Now I really knew,  I had fallen in love with you.   Is this serendipity!?  Or part of my fantasy!?  No, must’ve been reality,  It ended up all my misery.   Even if life is so bad,  Meeting you has been glad,  Losing you will be sad,  You’re the true love I’ve ever had.   You have done so much for me,  You even set my heart free,  And made me want to see,  The world as it should be.   Thanks for being there,  For the love you always share,  For being the one who cares,  Losing you I really can’t bear.   I love you my dear,  I really wish you are here,  Beside me, oh so near,  Sweetest words you want to hear.   So, if today I’ll die,  And in earth’s soil I may lie,  I do not wish to see you cry,  Even if I said my last goodbyes…
