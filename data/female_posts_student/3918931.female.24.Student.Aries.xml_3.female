Unfortunately the current was so strong that both of the traps submerged underwater.  Only the faint glow of the light attached to them was visible for about 2 minutes before they dissapeared, never to be seen again.  There was also about 60 ft of rope between the two traps holding them together, so there's quite a underwater hazard out in the middle of the Santee river now.  Ta well!  We eventually just tied 4 traps off to a bridge support and that worked fine.  The five gators that were out in the water with me seemed to approve, as their glowing eyes glided by about 10 meters away.  I let the traps stay out for about 1 hour then retrieved them to find that I hadn't caught 1 larval crab.  Well...I let the WTF's fly!  I'll try again tomorrow night.  The plan today is to round up some more fiddler crabs for Steve's (the PhD student I'm working with) enclosure project.  The high temp today is 97 degrees and you could literally cut through the mosquitoes with a knife.  But, it's all in the name of science.  Stupid science!    Hopefully there will be some waves today.  I need a brain clearing.   urlLink
