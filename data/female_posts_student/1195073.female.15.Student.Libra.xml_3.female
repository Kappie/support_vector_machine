'break stuff' by limp bizkit  things that made my day shitty: 1. mean/ rude 'friends' 2. 'cry me a river' by justin timberlake 3. 'animal farm' tests in language arts  random ramblings of the day: ~'my big fat greek wedding' is good ~i think i might start another blog about pop culture/entertainment  quote of the day: "look at that ass"  -- Fred Durst on Britney Spears (for some unjustified reason, i find that hilarious)
