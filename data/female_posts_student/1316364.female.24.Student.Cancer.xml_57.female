Things have been going as well as can be expected and there really isn’t too much to report back. I have adjusted very well to not having Jesse home, but I think part of that has to do with the fact that I have my mom and her boyfriend to keep me company, and very busy for that matter. Still it is very neat to be able to talk to Jesse via Internet chat, beings that those before us probably didn’t have that capability.   It has been 2 weeks since my Nana has passed and I can remember it like it was yesterday. I can still see the look on my mom’s face when I walked through the door. I can still see the shell of a body left behind in place of my Nana. I know that this will take quite a long time to adjust too, but it is also very hard to as well. Like some things, I wish I could just put it all behind me and move on.  But with the discussion of a life lost, a new life is about to be added to my already large family. My cousin Bernadette is expecting a little one at the end of May. This weekend is her baby shower. I just love baby showers! My mom and I made really cute party favors and decorated little basket bassinets to but them in. I bought her 2 Cute as can be baby outfits and just can’t wait until Saturday, when the party is. I love babies in general and can’t wait until I am able to have a baby shower of my own.
