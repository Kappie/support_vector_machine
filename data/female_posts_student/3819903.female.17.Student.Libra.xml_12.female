I woke up around 11, and my eyes were batting because of the bright sunlight that I just closed them...and fell asleep for 3 hours! Totally was just closing them to fix the contacts, and adjust to the light...yeah, or not! So when I dreamt and woke up 3 hours later...I hoped out of bed and walked down the stairs (almost fell down them...blood rush to the head!), and approached the mother who immediately said..."nice to see you up and raring to go this...afternoon!"    So after I returned Nicoles phone call (that I missed...cause I was asleep), we headed on over Jared Cisz' Grad Party. It was at Bethesda Park, and we played on the Jungle Gym with his cousins, and Greg...who is eqivalent to a little kid, and swung on the swings. I hadn't done that in the longest time! After getting in touch with our childhood, Nicole and I went to her house- confronted the bitchy mother- and played some poker with the boys. Well, the poker game lasted about 30 minutes, cause the brownies we had made prior to the arrival of Drowsy Joe were done. The brownies, got more attention than the poker game...and the funny thing is...we ate the hole 9"x 11" pan. I didnt, but Pat and Joe did. After our laziness, and the brownies took hold of us, we sat...lathargick and dazed on the couch,trying to keep "drugged-up-sick Joe" ("drugged up=benadryl...nothing illegal!) awake! So...to repel the laziness, we headed outside to play some hoops! Then it got really humid, and we were getting extremely sweaty from running around, and we decided that it was time to head on home to get sleep for our big day tomorrow!    Thanks to Nicole and Pat, who decided that an 8:22 tee-time was good! Who the hell wants to get up that early to play golf...for fun! I can see getting up early to play in a tournament...but this is just 9 holes! ahh..should be a longer day than today! haha WOW, nicole and I have plans to do WAY TOO MUCH stuff tomorrow! Golf, lunch, Mountain Climbing, Bowling...hmm..I think 3 out of 4 will be done! Oh well, that shall be an interesting blog for tomorrow!  Good Night, cause I'm definitley tired..how? I dunno? I've only been awake for 10 hours!
