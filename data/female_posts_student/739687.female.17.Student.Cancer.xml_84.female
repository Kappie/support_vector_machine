Today hasn't been too bad of a day...but for some reason it's all kinda blurred together in one big mess. I made some crazy quote thing a little while ago. It kinda sorta rhymes too. I don't neccessarily feel the way I've described, but I'd be lying to say that I've never felt that way before.  And the whole world stands around to watch in my time of need. Not a hand stretched out as I stumble to my bitter defeat. And though I beg and plead and cry, the crowd just stares in silence as I die.  Yea...anyways though...I'm so tired...today's been long...even if I can barely remember it. Well, I'm going to bed. Goodnight everyone.
