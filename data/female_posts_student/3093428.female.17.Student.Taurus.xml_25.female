So here I am, and it seems nobody realy posts anything anymore. Steph was going strong and then she died out. Just about the time I started puting lengthly posts on, such as this one. Sam hasn't posted anything ever since she joined, Andrew just leaves comments, and so on and so on. Really, i don't care, but it does get boring if i have to comment on my own stuff. Anywho...  So today I woke up at 1 in the afternoon, not good since I have a physics exam tomorrow, and i was planning on finishing my overdue CAPP projects that were due in like March or something. My counselor kinda hinted i wasn't going to graduate if i didn't hand that in soon.   Wow, summer is already upon us. Dyllan and them all at Palmer are already out of school, i mean, what's up with that? Stupid Richmond having to finish first. Well, I'm only a couple days behind, unlike poor McRoberts (who i feel very sorry for).   Work starts next week, and I really don't think much will change from this week. I only have a little bit of time before I have to go to work so summer for me might not even start until the All Nighter, which i still haven't beenable to book off yet. But yeah! Swimming on the 24th, thats gonna be fun. Anywho, duty calls...I'm probably gonna fail physics, why do i bother...
