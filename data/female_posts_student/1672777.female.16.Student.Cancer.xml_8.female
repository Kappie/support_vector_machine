YOu have chances to learn and grow, see and do, experience and enjoy life that other generations  only dreamed of. Now, what will you do with that opportunity?  Thats an important question, because opportunity is a two-sided coin. You can choose wisely wisely and chart for a happy and successful life...or pain and regret. With such stark alternatives, the choice is clear.  You want the good life-and that's what God wants for you, too. He's given you all the direction you need in His Word, the Bible."
