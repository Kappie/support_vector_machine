Haircut at Kenneth where I saw Ali Harris. Plus my name is Allison (Allie) it was just weird. The dance was fun, but I don't like rap, and that's all they played, except for three songs from  Grease  all in a row. I asked the DJ to play some rock, and he asked us what we wanted. Erica said "Linkin park!" He asked what song, and I said, "'Faint'"! Then he asked by what band and we shouted, "LINKIN PARK!" It was funny. Everyone looked beautiful! Ariel got bangs and I think they are gorgeous! I slow-danced with Julia. Everybody was making-out, which I find really gross. So she kissed me, it was great! We got a limo for afterwards. Our driver's name was Kareem, but he wasn't the basketball player. He was really hot, I have his number in my cell. We listened to good mixes by Elizabeth and cruised around town. We went to Waffle House at like 2 AM and it was packed! All in all it was good times, congrats prom committee! I drooled a lot in my sleep last night. Now I am really stressed. I have so much homework, and this next week is going to be pure hell! We are starting our final exam project in Spanish. In class, we were looking at an example slide for the presentation, and it talked about the story "Bodas de Sangre". If you don't habla espanol, that means "Weddings of Blood". Erica was like, "Bodas de Sangre??" And Senora said, "OH yes it is beauuuuuutiful!" AHH !I'm goning to Washington DC next Sunday for the Women's March. That will be a day gone for studying. And I'm going to the Less Than Jake concert on Friday, woo woo Ace will be there! The May 1st SAT is coming... THIS IS SO BAD. I am done for now. Bye bye, jar jar.
