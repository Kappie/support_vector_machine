My favourite character was the cat (with the voice of Antonio Banderas), he was so cute! Anyway, I advise you to go and see it because it is fantastic, you will laugh so much it's just great!  After the movie we went back home, prepared a nice dinner "en tete-a-tete" as the French may say, and watched some shows on TV before going back under the warm blanket...  Hope you will go and see "Shrek 2", the ogres, the donkey and the cat are really funny! Enjoy!
