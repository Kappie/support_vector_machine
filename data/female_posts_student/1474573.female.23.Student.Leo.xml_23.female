I'ts late and i just had a rivetting conversation with guy and i think it took alot of the tension out of me......working on this stupid page has helped too.....it's ironic how these webpages sort of become metaphors for how organized your life is. It's as if i'm supposed to define who i am in frames and lists and such and by reading this you will somehow get insight into who I am as a person.....makes you realize how much or how few convictions you have. The lines between what you are and what you arent'.......well you feel the pressure of making them more apparent.Maybe I'm getting way to deep into this or perhaps I'm coming to terms with the fact that at SOME point, i'm going to have to commit to certain things and in some cases certain people. I could hide behind the guise of "searching for myself" for a little while, when i was 19 and i was "new on the poetry scene"  (I AM quoting myself, and that ISN'T narcissistic, I just give myself more appropriate things to say then anyone else would DUH!) Certain battles around the world, in my backyard (or nearest open mic) and in my heart are being waged......question is...do i have the balls to face them?
