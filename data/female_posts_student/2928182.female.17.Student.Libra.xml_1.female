I think this is the lowest I've ever felt...maybe because she actually said it this time and didn't take it back that I did something wrong. I don't know. All I know is my eyes are watering up and my skin is getting hot, which I don't know if that's a part of it but it makes me feel worse physically. Nothing like saying if we were going to spend time together only to get back a 'I'd rather not since I've felt ignored this whole time'. ...Now I sound like I'm blaming her. Wonderful. Aren't I the greatest boyfriend ever... -_-
