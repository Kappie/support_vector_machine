Of course, a 35-minute cry-and-gripe-and-whine to yourself session is always yay so as to prevent other people's feeling sorry for you.   But I feel a little better, because mom totally rocks-- she bought me coffee creamer and lots and lots of those yogurt smoothies before leaving for Italy (she's leaving tomorrow evening).  Oh, and my grandmother's actual physical elsewhereness totally makes things better.  *Sigh* I need to go get ready for a stupid performance.    "Sweet Song"  by Blur  What am I to do Someone here is really not happy Put myself on a line It seems I never got through to you So I wean myself off slowly  I'm a darkened soul My streets all pop music and gold All our lives are on TV You switch off and try to sleep People get so lonely  I believe I believe I believe Everything's out to sea I believe I believe I believe I believe That is the way it should be I hope you feel the same  Everyone is dying Stop crying now here comes the sun I didn't mean to hurt you no no no It takes time to see what you have done So I wean myself off slowly  I believe I believe I believe Love is the only one I deceive I deceive I deceive I deceive 'Cause I'm not that strong  Hope you feel the same  And now it seems that we're falling apart But I hope I see the good in you Come back again I just believed in you
