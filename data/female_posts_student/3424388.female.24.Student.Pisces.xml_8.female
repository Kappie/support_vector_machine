I frequented here before they got wi-fi, but now I'm here daily.   A year or so ago, I saw some regulars, but nothing close to the number of familiar faces I now see daily.  So it turns out I'm not the only one who can't work from home.  This place is addictive.  All the coffee you can drink.  All the bandwidth, as far as I know, you'll ever really need.     I don't live in a large city.  This place is far from Silicon Valley, and tech companies are few and far between.  Granted it is a college town, and it has a large medical center, large pharm company and a sizable percentage of international residents, so I suppose it has many of the right elements - meaning that a good chunk of the population is likely to be transient and/or has few familiar ties to this place.         It's started to get a little crowded for my liking.  Seeing the same faces day after day is a bit odd; it's almost like belonging to a club that I never volunteered to join.  My guess is that most of them, like me, are students.  I wonder how packed this place is going to be once the fall term rolls around.    I've read of businesses that rent out cubes to people such as me and provide all the espresso you can drink.  It's an interesting concept, and I imagine it's possible that they make money on the extras such as printing and copying services.  I wonder how soon, or even if, these places will see a profit.  And I wonder if cafes such as this one make money on serial customers who hold tables hostage for hours at a time.  I know they make lots of money off me.  I'd say the true economic impact is difficult to measure, as you would have to determine whether non-lingering customers get feed up with serial customers and stop frequenting places that permit lingerers.
