Sometmies, we get so mad at our close friend or whatever, and we say we don't care about them anymore and tat they're not worth our time. Is that true? Thats not how I see it. It's cause we still care and love that friend of ours so much that we bother getting mad at little things that they do that bugs you. It's cause you still care 'bout them. If it was just some random person, I probably wouldn't even care if they're about to go screw themselves over. It's cause i care 'bout her, thats why i even bother getting mad at her and getting frustrated at the things she does wrong. It's cause deep down, I still love her very much. Even though after all those not so nice things she's ever done to me, including ditching, lying, rudeness, taking me for granted. I still love her.      I had a very nice talk with Jasy yesterday when we were walking to Zehrs to get some food for the movie nite. And I guess we all go thru something similar like that. Each and every last one of us. It's juss the matter of how to treat this problem and to improve it. Relationships are not one-sided. It takes both to put effort in it. I'm glad I had jasy to talk things out with. Consider we were half talking and half laffing our heads off throughout the convo. I guess i'm glad I moved to Waterloo, it's been a year since I've moved here. So much has happened, so much have gotten me further in life. So much has helped me grown and mature. I've met so many new friends, and grew to see that theres so many people out there that are willing to care for me, if i juss give them a chance to. I've met friends like Jasy, Jo, Kat, Dora, Tiff, Amanda, Esther, Victoria, and a lot more that i can go on listing. They were there when I was invisible. They helped me through times that I myself cannot bear alone. We've grown to trust each other and help each otherthrough things. Yes, there may be this age gap, but so what? We don't feel it at all. I'm glad that God moved my family to Waterloo, allowing me to meet new friends and realize what a true friend really is.
