Dead' - all right, what can we do that won't make you wanna go home? ^_^  Doll, you poor girl, next time you're on a roll, take a breather. ^_^  Well, *I* had fun today, and am currently furious with the college board *thing* because it won't let me register.  Ooh ooh, and I watched  Star Trek: Next Generation  tonight!!  *Love* that show - watched Gambit . . .this is pretty much only for those of you who are as dorky about this show as I am, cause no one else will get it.  It's the two part where Picard is Galen and it's smuggling and drama and *sooo* good.  No, I'm *not* a nerd. ^_^  Oh, and Conrad? -  I am not a feral kitten !!!  Hmph.  *Really* ^_~
