However these posters are not affiliated with any group. It would have been nice if they asked us before taking down the m3r poster. Really quite rude. It shall replaced on thursday. Also all blogspot sites have been banned at school. If anyone out there has cable internet and Windows XP contact me as there's some sort f shindig you can do so people can get around the filter at school. We asked Woody what the deal was and he was all like 'some kids complained because there was derogatory language about womens bodies or something'. this may be true, Natasha's post about Lyndie England could be what they were referring to. Anyway its bullshit that they can just block all the blogspots. He said if we wanted to get certain sites exempted from the ban , then we could. So we might delete that post then submit m3r. Any thoughts?
