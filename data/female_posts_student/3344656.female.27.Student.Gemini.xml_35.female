When I moved to Maine, in addition to my really hard, depressing job taking care of kids with mental illness and helping their families change their ways so they wouldn't be removed from their custody and thrown into the foster care system, I took a light, fun job during the fall and summer.  Or summer and fall, if you like things chronologically.  Anyhow, I digress.  I was working as an assistant to a photograper, and it being summer and fall in Maine, we did a ton of weddings.    The first wedding we did was an outdoor wedding, in a field, on a cliff, over the sea in Spruce Head, Maine.  It was an expensive wedding, the tent for the reception was lovely, and the day was a photographer's dream... slightly overcast, reducing the need for gobos, filters, etc, diffusing the light perfectly.  But as the bride walked across the field in her dress, got married, and whatnot, we were taking some close pictures of her and her husband.  And I decided right then and there that I'd NEVER have an outdoor wedding (I've never wanted one, so it wasn't a hardship).  The number of crickets crawling on and up her dress, between the lovely layers of organza, satin, and chiffon  really freaked me out.  If you've spent any significant time with me, you know I have a SERIOUS bug phobia... centered primaril around roaches and crickets... they make me want to barf.  So kids, before you decide to run across a field of daisies and get married up a tree (Yes, I know someone who did that), think about how close to nature you REALLY want to be in your lovely clothes.
