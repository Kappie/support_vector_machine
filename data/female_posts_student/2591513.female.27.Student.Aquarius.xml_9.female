It had to be the worst feeling because it was the closure of the pregnancy....the finale.  They gave me this medicine that induced me and so I have been so tired and moody.  I can't even explain my feeling...like I want to cry and to mourn, but it feels like it isn't right...but the fetus, embryo, whatever the medical terminology is for it was my child....regardless of how developed he or she may have been.  That is something I cannot deny.  Anyway, I am tired and exhausted and just want to rest.  The painkillers are great, but have taken their toll on me.
