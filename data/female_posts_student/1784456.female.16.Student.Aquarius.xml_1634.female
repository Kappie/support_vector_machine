Tell us where you put the weapons. Saddam : I have no weapons, you Western Infidel.  FBI1        : Yes you do.  We sold them to you in the 1980's.  Look, here's the receipt.  Kurdish Gas, Botulism spray, Meaballs in gravy.  It's all here.  Saddam    : I take them back to Argos and get refund.  14 day return policy.  Not suitable for purpose.  Bracket missing from self-assembly ICBM missile.  Meatballs particularly unpleasant.  I get vouchers and buy DVD player and free Bruce Willis box set.  Top Banana!  *aahhh, so much better than my one!* Hey, I've been having a stressful time from the tests, and now I'm freeeee! *wahoo!* Anyway, this was done by Vegan Shoe a.k.a. Dado Rail a.k.a. Ian. Personally I think he should have mentioned peas at least once *mine was better!* (was not, fool!) :P Anyway, let's all be thankful that they shoved Bush down the hole after they got Saddam out. :D
