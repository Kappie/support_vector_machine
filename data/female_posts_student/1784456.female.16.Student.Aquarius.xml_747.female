Well ok, so in English I kind of day dream all the time and when the dream finishes I come back to reality and I realise how much it sucks. Sad aye? Sad but strange, sad but strange. No one wants to talk to me apart from you guys and I don't know if I can be bothered to do all the talking around people! Why should I bother? Ok depressed Katie! And now I'm listening to Metallica... hmm, time to paint my room black! Hey I'm getting weird again! Yeay! Told you it only lasted a few seconds. Ok, back to being slightly depressed. Maybe it's an early life crisis! Yeay! Oh well... hmm I need jump up and go music but I can't find any. When I get knocked down, Will you still be here hanging around? Staring in my eyes, Laughing at my demise. Watching me cry, Wondering why, And if you care, Reach out for me And help me be free. OK! Well I need to go watch tv before I seriously turn every thing black!
