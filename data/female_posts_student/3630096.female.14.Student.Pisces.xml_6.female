It's not that I'm scared of failing the test but scared of the teacher pulling me away during band practices in order to pass my Napha, or train, or something similar. Last year, I had not been able to go back for band rehersal due to Napha. I just simply can't jump far! Gee. I can never pass my Napha.    Next, there's common test today and my mind doesn't seem to work just as well as usual. I can't think. I just stared at the poem and read along the lines. This poem seemed oddly familiar as if I had read itsomewhere before... But I can't think! I read the question, then I stared at it and picked up my pen and scribbled something in my script. I refered back to the question again and started to pick up evidence and something... But! It's so less! There's only two pages! I've got an instinct that says I'm going to fail this literature common test just like before! It's streaming! I can't afford to fail! But my mind simply can't think! What can I do!?    And then there is the IPW presentation to worry about. We haven't done the third instruments and that is the string! It's Victor job to do it but none of us will believe that he will be doing it on his own motivation. You believe that!? Gee.    I just can't stop worrying about troubles and problems heading towards me in a few weeks or days time. Can somebody please help me!? Ahhhhhhhhhh!
