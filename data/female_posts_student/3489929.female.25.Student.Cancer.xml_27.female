Major kudos to  urlLink Tuskudrusla  for the kick-ass blogskin (I can't understand a word of your blog, seeing as how it's in Icelandic, but I'm happy to link your page!).      The amazing thing is, I don't know squat about HTML, but I have managed to teach myself enough to fake it. :)      I did all this by myself. V.v. proud of me. **tooting my own horn** Meep-meep!      Here's hoping for a wonderful Tuesday!!!
