Muhahahaaa! *cough cough cough* Geez, all this fake coughing is getting to me in my old age. (14 is old age?) Well... yeah... I gues... (...not...) Ok, so it isn't but it seems old to me cause I've only been alive for 14 years so I don't really know and longer periods of time! (I'm sure that could of been put better with about three words but what the heck.) Hmm... we could always try to find Jon's house again! (We did that when he didn't come into Nailsea to meet us so we could go to Bristol *breathes*) Fun aye! I think I thought of some thing we could do in a dream... can't remember it though. I'm guessing it would have some thing to do with machine guns and killer teddy bears... maybe we couldn't doing that seeing as there are no killer teddy bears and my dad confiscated my machine gun. :'( *sob sob* So sad! (Weeeeeird!) Hey shut up! You're not even sure how to spell weird/wierd! (Neither are you!) Draw. *freaks of nature!* Thanks. I better go, I'm getting weird by the minute and I haven't had dinner yet! Sooo hungry! Bubi!
