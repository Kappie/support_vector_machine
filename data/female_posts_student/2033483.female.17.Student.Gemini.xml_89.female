Renae and I arrived earlier than the other two and told the waitress it was Jessica's birthday...It wasn't, we just wanted the free dessert.  The waitress said that they didn't do any special singing or anything but they did celebrate birthdays and we told her that was fine.  When we were done with our meal, here comes the waitress and the rest of the staff singing happy birthday to Jessica.  But they didn't know her name so they had to sing it again and this time one of the waiters announced to the entire restaurant that it was Jessica's birthday and encouraged them to sing-a-long.  We're proud to say we conned an entire restaurant.  Wednesday, I dragged Renae around the mall picking up job applications.  I'm currently unhappy with my salary, which is nothing.  Thursday is much like Monday in that it is not worth mentioning.  Today, I picked my brother and his friends up from school *cough*nerds*cough*.  I arrived to Edison a bit early because I overestimated the amount of time it would take me to run some errands so I took a drive and found out that Augie isn't too far away.  So since I found Augie I had to find Jessica's dad's house and then I found Summit and Logan lives on Summit.  I knew where I was at all thanks to the sculpture of the Elephant/Mammoth.  My mom and I took care of Alex again tonight so Brian and Tami could go out to eat and shh...Buy my birthday present.  But before that happened my dad, mom and I went to the new Bagel Boy for supper.  I really like it in there, it has a really nice atmosphere.  It gets five stars from me.  Then we went to the Home Depot to buy paint.  I like the Home Depot, my creative side just gushes out.  Our basement will be done pretty soon, so you know what that means...Yes, Renae we will finally have a house to hang out and a good space that no one can bug us.  Now we don't have to drive around town with you saying, "What are we gonna do?" every 20 seconds.  I'm going to go to bed now because I'm kinda tired.  I Love You, ~KAY
