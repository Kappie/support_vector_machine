Even when I try to explain how I feel, they don't understand so I try to steer clear of personal conversations with them. So we went out to eat at some bar and grill place. I got this thing that was pretty much the same as a Roman burger and fries with pink lemonade. I was soo full! I felt like a pig. I couldn't even finish. The sandwich was so freaking  HUGE!  Oh that reminds me. Every time I go to the store my mom asks me what kind of pop I want.  I DON'T DRINK POP MOM!  Geez, I've been like this for a year and a half and she still hasn't caught on. So back to tonight, we were on our way to Blockbuster when we realized neither of us had a Blockbuster card so we had to go to Bob Evans to get Eddie's. Cuz he works there.So we went to Blockbuster and we rented the Secret Window. I thought it was gonna be super scary but it was only a tad bit errie. But the ending didn't make sense. It was so outthere. Oh well. I expected more from Johnny Dep. Like I said before, here's a poem.    This poem is a little out there. Don't ask me why I wrote it, I was just bored one day. But I love it! It's not really about drugs and drinking. It's about being in love withsomeone so much that it feels like you're drunk or high. And the previewpartmeans like getting the chance to show the person that you'd make a goodcouple and they'd come back toyou and realizethey loveyou too.       Thrill    It felt like I overdosed,  Was my vision just blurry or did I really see ghosts?  I was so high, it was difficult to think,  Let’s not get started on everything I had to drink…    You were my addiction,  These drugs make the world seem like fiction.  Hours passed in a daze,  My brain was clouded like a haze.    Did you slip me some sort of pill?  Just to get with me? Baby, I’m one hell of a thrill!  I’ll give you a preview and you’ll come back, begging for more…     Because as you know, I’m to die for…
