Thus begineth the commentary:  The Art of Paper Mosaics By Meghan So-And-So  Ahhhhhh mosaics: these early roman art pieces are something of a mystery. Why? Because I can't seem to conquer them. Granted, using construction paper and elmers glue would take the luster out of most anything. The question is...how the heck are you supposed to place the things correctly? I mean, my designs all right, geometric and all. But the paper just will not work for me. As for the glue, well it wont spread right. It's not my fault I swear! It can't possibly be my fault. Never-the-less I have to finish it soon or it will drive me crazie. (Commentary end)  Well I have gotta go talk to some Anti-War idiots who are 1. Misinformed and 2. just stupid.
