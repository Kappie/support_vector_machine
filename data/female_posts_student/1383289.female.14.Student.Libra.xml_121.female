INSANE IN THE MEMBRANE. it sucks. ehehehehheadflhfasdjhfwaiueyfaj fuck fuck fuck im alway screw EVERYTHING up. kelly says i should of just said yeah ill try to keep the promise of not hooking up with anyone. i was like no bc 1)thats giving up everything i stand for...random hook ups. 2)a promise shouldnt make a relationship work. bc if he really did want me then he should actually trust me. bc that jsut makes me mad and makes me want to go and make out with sumone. 3) i dont want to make a promise while were not going out and have another drunken night. 4) how do i even know if its gona work. like what if i did sumthing else and it was over. .....WAIT i  already  did! and it  probably  is over. fuck it.   i duno waht to do anymore. should i just give up like he did? or keep trying to get him back? i duno. it would be such a waste if he didnt want to see me. waht a heartbreak. kelly told me he told her to tell me that he gives up. and that he doesnt want to try any more. like all day ive been ..blah.. it sucks. like i dont even want to go out. i duno. maybe if sumone called me. i duno i duno. ijust feel ..eh.. empty. like my stomach dropped. and doing summersaults. i duno how to explain it...like i feel like i can float. yet im scared of heights. its the feeling in your stomach wehn ur about to go down on a roller coaster or wehn ur looking down over the edge a building. and you feel like ur about to fall... i cant breath. like the air feels so stuffy...even wehn im out side. i duno. im completly lost. so many thoughts through my head. but theyr so smushed together that i dont know what the problem is. iduno what im thinking about.   fuck this is hard.
