An experience I didn't particularly enjoy. I knew everyone there, but not well enough to really have a conversation with, so it was kind of awkward. I felt a little out of place the whole time. Oh well. Friends was good. Eric Zuber asked me for my screen name so his brother Paul could im me. I guess he saw me in the play and wanted to talk to me, lol. We talked for almost 2 hours, and he seems really sweet. He said he sees me in the hall, but hes too shy to say hi! How cool is that? We'll see where that goes. So I'm thinking Michelle and I might do something tonight, and then we're going to Pyde's tomorrow. Fun stuff. I think we only have like 12 days of school left. Thats crazy! Plus, marching band starts on monday. Yay for band! Lol.
