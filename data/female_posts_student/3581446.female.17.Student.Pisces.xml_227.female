She's the only teacher that be playing music in class. THAT IS WHY SHE RULLLLLLLLLEEESSSSSSSSS.  I was the only person in first period! I feel like such a square. I'm actually going to my classes. Heeyyyy...I don't think any of my friends are here. :(  Awww...Tiffany gave me a rose. What a sweetheart! OOOOH and there's a really cool tiny white bug in it. It has teeny black dots on it. What a pretty bug. ^_^  Arf...I'm bored.  I went to the Columbia City theatre. It's not a bad place at all. I thought it was gonna be shitty and have bad sound and picture quality, but it was very nice. It's about time we got a theatre down in the south end. I saw the Stepford Wives with Emily and her mom. It was funny...and a little creepy. I don't like robots...and the whole 1950s housewives thing. They're just...hella burnt. Anway...after the movie, we went to Walgreens to develop my pics. It took an hour! First, I was waiting for someone to fill the machine with paper. Then, I waited over 10 minutes for nothing. I thought the pics were printing, but nooooooooo. The computer froze. Then I got help and the pics printed out. I bought them and left. When we were a block away from the store, I took out the pics to look at them. The edges were burned and ripped!!! So, I went back and printed them again for free, of course. I always have bad luck when I get my pics printed out. It always takes so dang long.  I gots to go shopping! The Orca reunion is on Saturday. I need to look bomb, man...and I hope I'm going with all my friends as a group. I can't wait to see everyone! Especially them crack hoes. Uh huh. And if someone rolls their eyes at me, we're gonna have some problems. I'm not even playing. I should have done something a long time ago.   EWWWWW! Ray took a pic of me and I totally blinked. I am looking oh so butch and unkemt. :D
