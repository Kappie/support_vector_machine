You could tell when he won that one instead. I bet he was wishin' he hadn't passed up his first option with the Peace drum kit and Volcom surfboards and a trip. goddamnit! i was pissed at him. that was one of the best showcases they've ever had! He was with this stupid christian group. They "go around lovin' on people". so yeah, i have no idea how he thought he would've gotten a better showcase than a trip, drumkit, and surfboards. oh well.  Muppets Rockin' Out!  Jell-O forever!
