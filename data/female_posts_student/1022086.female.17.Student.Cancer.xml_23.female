I had excessive amounts of chocolate as we made brownies at Clint's and whatnot. Everyone left, though, for a bunch of random and unknown reasons.    Anyway, other than the good food (hehehe), I also watched some good movies, although I was forced to leave before the end of one I was really enjoying because of fear of murder from the motherly unit for coming home entirely too late. Luckily, she wasn't up, although I heard an extended unnecessity about it this morning... =-P   Maybe it was the excess of chocolate that made me have such an awful nightmare, as well as the movie that I was watching before we left, which dealt with the Holocaust.  I dreamt that a Nazi, representing the Angel of Death, came to get me. It was very scary. I woke up sweating and sat there a while. I never seem to be able to remember the good dreams; all I ever remember when I actually  reach  REM are the nightmares. I think the last worst two were seeing a beautiful angel in front of me and, suddenly, a staff flying toward its forehead and killing it. Then there was the one in which daddy was abandoned and died in a very strange land. Honestly, my dreams are so messed up. And there was the one in which Grubbs, Jefts, and Johnson locked me in the trunk of a 1960 VW Bug...  yeah, the trunk...   The pondery mood I wound up in led me to the conclusion that life is a pain in the butt in the sense that anything good seems to fade away immediately and the "bad stuff" seems to linger neverendingly, and it sucks. Lately, it seems as though I'm always working... for nothing. However, life moves on, and so must every living organism that's willing to keep up and avoid death.   On that note, I'm going to find a way to get along with Patrick. I don't know quite how yet- I may need to have a talk with him, but I'm going to get along with him, and I'm going to get up off the floor and learn how to take what life throws at me in a better way than I have been doing lately. Life's too short for dwelling on misery. I mean, I've gone through entirely worse times and made it through.
