YES ....i am in love......i have been...just in denial. It's more then a river y'a'll . And two? people go see Kill Bill. Terentino has done it again, i'm afraid to say. This movie is all my girl hood fantasies........i won't say anymore except go see it. Anyone who wants to  talk about just how straight up AWESOME this movie is, comment on my guestbook. Anyway while i'm at home and i finally have this god awful house to myself...maybe i can get some  much needed work done......maybe some writing....maybe i'll get the balls to make a fone call that i need to make.....romance and intimacy are not my strong suits....
