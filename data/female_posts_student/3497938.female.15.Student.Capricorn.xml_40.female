Stu gave me a drumstick and he and Andrew signed it. Hey Michelle-> "ELI DRANK OUT OF MY WATER... OH MY GOSH *shrieks and gets all happy, then faints*" It was fun. We were jumping around and head banging like idiots. It was great. On a more drama front- Drew is bein totally mean. I dont know what his problem is. I told him I love him and he said he doesnt believe me. What the hell is up with that? Ya know, whatever. Im going to have to get over him, at least for now. I cant constantly be down because of him. Martina McBride sings a song called how far and it says "How far do I have to go to make you understand; I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are. So I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say how far" and thats how I feel... Im here if he wants me, but im not going to waste my summer feeling sorry for myself. And maybe I'll go out with another guy and have fun. He'll get mad, but oh well. *man, that sounds bad* But, I deserve to have fun...
