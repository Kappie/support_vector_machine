(Thanks to Ella for making me see myself as evil - I really appreciate it ... not!). Yeah - sorry bout the sarcasm. Aziz is back and she's being mean to me, and Ella's friends with her and has been talking to her which is perfectly understandable, but I'm really not in the mood to be understandable.  I gave Ad√®le my old diary (term 4, year 9) to read. I just felt like it. She will probably find it extremely amusing. I dunno. I'm just strange.  Anyway, just so that I think that my blog isn't completely boring, I'm going to post some jokes, courtesy of my friends at  urlLink www.funny.com  - just note: these will be jokes that I haven't read before, so they probably won't be any good because I've been on this site quite a bit, and the jokes are ranked in order of funniness. Oh well, here goes:     Playing the Game   Two bored dealers are waiting around for someone to walk up and try their luck at the craps table. A very attractive lady comes in and wants to bet twenty-thousand dollars on a single roll of the dice. The dealers agree. She says, "I hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I'm half naked." With that she strips naked from the waist down, and rolls the dice while yelling, "Momma needs a new pair of pants!" She then begins jumping up and down and hugging each of the dealers. "YES! I WIN! I WIN!" With that she picks up her money and clothes and quickly leaves. The dealers just stare at each other dumbfounded. Finally one of them asks, "What did she roll anyway?" The other answers, "I don't know. I thought YOU were watching the dice!"     Missionary   A missionary who had spent years showing a tribe of natives how to farm and build things to be self-sufficient gets word that he is to return home. He realizes that the one thing he never taught the natives was how to speak English, so he takes the chief and starts walking in the forest. He points to a tree and says to the chief, "This is a tree." The chief looks at the tree and grunts, "Tree." The missionary is pleased with the response. They walk a little farther and the padre points to a rock and says, "This is a rock." Hearing this, the chief looks and grunts, "Rock." The padre is really getting enthusiastic about the results when he hears a rustling in the bushes. As he peeks over the top, he sees a couple in the midst of heavy romantic activity. The padre is really flustered and quickly responds, "Riding a bike." The chief looks at the couple briefly, pulls out his blow gun and kills them. The padre goes ballistic and yells at the chief that he has spent years teaching the tribe how to be civilized and kind to each other, so how could he just kill these people in cold blood that way? The chief replied, "My bike."  (These aren't very funny ...)     Talking Frog   A man was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said, "If you kiss me I will turn into a beautiful princess." He bent over , picked up the frog, and put it in his pocket. The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will tell everyone how smart and brave you are and how you are my hero." The man took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it, and returned it to his pocket. The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will be your loving companion for an entire week." The man took the frog out, smiled at it and returned it to his pocket. The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for a year and do ANYTHING that you want." Again the man took the frog out, smiled at it, and put it back into his pocket. Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess, that I will stay with you for a year and do any thing that you want. Why won't you kiss me?" The man said, "Look, I'm a computer programmer. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a TALKING FROG IS COOL."  Okay, that's enough now. I honestly cannot be bothered to copy/paste and edit these jokes (when they pase in here they go all haywire).  I might post more tonight. I mightn't though, because I have the VCE information evening, and it's very important that I go.  Here are the VCE subjects that I have chosen: Yr 11. English 1/2 Lit 1/2 Methods 1/2 General Maths (M) 1/2 French 1/2 Visual Communications 1/2 Psych 3/4  Yr 12. English 3/4 Lit 3/4 Methods 3/4 French 3/4 Visual Communications 3/4  I need to decide whether it's worth doing general maths in year 11 or not. I think it's a good idea, but I need to talk about it with a maths teacher (pref. Mrs Gibbons) and see what they recommend I do. I might even do specialist in year 12 - but that'd be really hard. I don't know if I could cope with 6 subjects in year 12. But I'm sure I'll be fine with 7 in yr 11 - it's not all that important. Year 12 is what really counts ...
