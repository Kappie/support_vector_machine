I was reading this blog... and this guy had all of his compulsive behaviors listed. Then I thought,  shit!I do some pretty weird stuff too!!!!  The thing is, it's part of having attention problems, not OCD. Really I am not clean or orderly, just weird.      When I run warmup laps I constantly count my steps... It gets pretty high. With crunches I count too, except I can't seem to count to fifty... always by tens. Running on treadmills is even worse because then it gives me the opportunity to calculate my mph, constantly.    When I copy stuff at work I always have to copy in the exact same manner... same way to put the paper in, same way to pick it up and staple and paper clip etc.    When I can't sleepI don't count sheep, I do math. Or speak german in my head. I hate math so I guess it helps me fall asleep better. Still though, pre-calc at 3 am?     I always have to have a game of spider solitaire open on the computer. Also before I could ever start hw I would have to win a game of solitaire... which was a convenient way of procrastinating I guess.      heh. that's all I feel like sharing.    So, what have I been up to lately? Lots of working. Unfortunately I can't stay at work for more than five hours a day or I get really bad headaches from the insanely boring shit I do. aieeeeeee.... So I've probably only made 200 dollars or soooo. The fact that I wake up at 11 every day probably doesn't help. I've been sleeping over at Karin's so much in the past couple of weeks that my sleeping schedule is so out of whack. We always go to bed at about 430 and wake up at noon... I feel like I have a hangover.  ALSO MY DREAMS ARE SO FUGGIN WEIRD!!!!!!     I had one where a bunch of people I knew were going on a field trip somewhere and on the way back the bus stopped at Costco to eat (wtf?) then Luke insisted on buying potato chips but I was like, "No way man potato chips suck arse." We bought them anyway. Then... something involving filling up canyons with edible sand. Yeah, that's when it stopped making sense to me too.    I had another dream where Elizabeth Kulajhgsheza whatever her last name is came to TJ as a junior replacement because Robinson was depressing and spilled her guts to me. lmao.         Then by far the best and weirdest of the three was when I was hospitalized for something and they had me hooked up to the lil electrodes I have at physical therapy, but instead of shocking/massaging my muscles they were there to monitor my vitals. I rolled over in my sleep and the electrodes came off, so of course the machine thought I died. Out of nowhere the little machine that shocks you when you have a heart attack pops out from under the bed and shocks me, feeling uncannily like those invisible fences for dogs, thena nurse hears me screaming and comes in to turn the thing off. Then she's like shit why are you here you're just getting your teeth fixed. My friggin huge tooth falls out and she tells me I can go. So I get in the car with Karin (why was she there? who knows...) and we realize neither of us can legally drive. Because this is a dream and not reality we decide I should be the one to drive. It's dark and we're on Popes Head and I accidentally swerve on the wrong side of the road and nearly hit someone. Then I go, "Damn! It's a good thing this Accord has such tight steering!" WTF WTF WTF lol. We get to our destination and it turns out it's Rachel Miller's house. I'm not sure what happened from there... something about how I needed to see her so badly I just drove over to her house with driving ability whatsoever. Then I think I might have professed my undying love of her. And then I woke up.      aieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.   SO WEIRD. But it's cool that I could remember my dreams in that much detail.        Enough about dreams. Last Sunday we all went over to Maria's and had our very late 4th of july party.  AND THE COPS BUSTED US . ahahaha. I thought the car was Andrew's dad's and then I realized that there was a spotlight shining in my face and I was like ohhh shit. Somehow I couldn't wipe the shit-eating grin off my face, though. Fortunately he didn't kill us. Still I'm impressed at how badass we are. OOH OOH and we made Raj wear makeup. Hoooooot. He looked like a cross-dressing Indian Cleopatra but boy was it  hot .        Watching King Arthur made me want to go out and kill people with swords like a pseudo-amazon.
