I guess Nasir Kazmi is the kind of poet who has always brought feelings and vague things into focus for me. The first time I read him was when I was 14. What's more interesting is that he gives that socialist touch in his poetry. The people's poet. Since, I don't know anything about the poet's life (there's not much literature available on that here in Peshawar... sigh!) and as I said in the last post, there isn't anyone I really know who'd know about these things. Living in Peshawar is not easy. It seems bereft of literary talent. *double sighs* There is Sir Taha Khan but how would I go meet him? That's another problem. Being a girl out here is a big problem. Nopes. Not a problem. It's a handicap. I'm far from the topic I started. So I was saying, to me Nasir Kazmi seems like a socialist or a communist (during his time, there were many socialist/communist poets and no I'm not confusing the two ideologies) because he used to write about the common man and his problems like life, economy, jobs etc. Anyway, I'll leave these thoughts incomplete for now. I need more information. I might be going to the Central Library in a few days. I'll see if I can find some information on him. Hope so!     Your Name Distresses Me Sometimes    Your name distresses me sometimes And without a cause do I feel restless sometimes  Oh, heart! Who has this gift of anxiousness? Only some get this comfort in life sometimes  With your blessings, oh pain of immaculate beauty Has become the heart a resting place for friends sometimes  The vigor of madness in the tempest of sorrow Has drowned your face in tears sometimes  A day when your proximity would not bring my heart content Has gone by on me sometimes  Neither thought of you nor thoughts of mine The night of parting has passed like that sometimes  Oh friend! Though long has it been since I quit love I have felt your need sometimes  Nasir Kazmi   18th November 2003
