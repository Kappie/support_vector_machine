And did you ever go to the doc.? HA HA HA I can't believe you got shot by a bb gun. Okay not a laughing matter. How do you feel? I think mason is sorry dude. I read your blog you wrote. He was all like sorry sorry sorry. I wish I could have been there. 1 I could have been wit you. 2 I could have been wit mason 3 I would have been able to flip out on Lee. Well as long as he said that he don't member and he didn't say that we didn't I'm okay wit it. But yeah. I don't think Jeff is feeling to good. He keep writing in his blog about how he wants to die. I don't want him to die. He is so sweet. I just hope he think about it real good. And then he changes his mind about it.   Well i'm gonna hit it up.  PEACE THE FUCK OUT!!! Q TO THE P
