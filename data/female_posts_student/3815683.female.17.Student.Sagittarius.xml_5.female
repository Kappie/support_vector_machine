That is why some believe that there IS life after death, some believe in holy spirit and some want to believe that there is no god. This very craving leads some to go to church every Sunday and some to NOT go to church in their lifetime. (if u know what i mean). Everyone has a different theory abt life and its ways. And they want+need to live by it. Emphasis on NEED as it is like a emotional desire that a human yearns to fulfil even if it makes them blindly believe in something totally convincing yet...deceptive. Although this is what I believe in I am also a victim as i want to believe in this theory. Now Don't get carried away..coz it is Just a theory, My thoery n i don't expect anyone to agree with me. I just wanna make my voice heard.
