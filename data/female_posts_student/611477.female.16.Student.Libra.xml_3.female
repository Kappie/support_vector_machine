Yeah.  Ain't so bad, really... but I ain't been in the mood lately to keep creating that pattern.   Cat sweater Made in random bits of thrift shop acrylic I couldn't find a pattern I like, so I'm winging it. Not being able to figure proper armhole placement, I'm going to try steeks.  Better to practice on this than on a 4-month sweater, right?   Next up after I finish either of those: Better Mousetrap Socks - Interweave Knits, Fall 2001 French Market Bag - whatever Knitty that was  That's the plan, at least... who knows.  And now, for gratuitous lyrics that will stretch out the entry... until I get enough entries to properly shape the page, this'll do... give me more breathing room to add to the sidebar.....   Nautical Wheelers who call themselves sailors  Play fiddle tunes under the stars  Petticoats rustle, workin' shoes scuffle  Shuffle on down to the bar   Where the jukebox is blastin' and the liquor is flowin'  An occasional bottle of wine  That's 'cause everyone here is just more than contented  To be livin' and dyin' in three-quarter time   And it's dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  Take me to stars that you know  Come on and dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  I want so badly to go   Well, the left foot'll follow  Where the right foot has travelled  Down to the sidewalks unglued  Into the streets of my city so neat  Where nobody cares what you do  Sonia's just grinnin' and Phil is ecstatic  Mason has jumped in the sea  And I'm hangin' on to a line from my sailboat  All Nautical Wheelers save me   And it's dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  Take me to stars that you know  Come on and dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  I want so badly to go   Well the sunrise'll bring on  Sleep that's escaped us  Everyone's off to their bed  There'll be huggin', squeezin'  Little pleazin' and teasin'  And rubbin' of each other's heads  So won't you dream on compadres, seems nothing escapes you  Nothin', no reason, no rhyme  That's 'cause everyone here is just more than contented  To be livin' and dyin' in three-quarter time   And it's dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  Take me to stars that you know  Come on and dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  I want so badly to go  I want so badly to go  Yes, I want so badly to go
