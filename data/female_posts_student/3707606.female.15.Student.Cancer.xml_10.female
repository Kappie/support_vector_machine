I know cause he went on MSN... never calls at all... never even talks to me on MSN. NEWHO just had to bitch about that.  And what the hell is up with guys... all they have to do is wake up and throw on clothes... we as girls have to make ourselves look good.... IM GIVING UP... no more making myself pretty for no reason!  Oh and by the way... me and melissa have decided we are buying an island and moving there so theres no one there but we have tv and movies and internet and shit and we can olny see ppl when we want to!!!! and no one can find us!! yaayayaya
