As I sat there contemplating my next action I saw my copy of   urlLink Kingdom Hearts   sitting on top of my Playstation 2. I decided I had nothing better to do, so I started playing it.  6 hours later, my foot was asleep, and I was two inches from my TV screen. I some how was trapped in a little world in which nothing but saving the world from the Heartless mattered.  Apparently while I was trying to save everyone from the Heartless, Abby was trying to get a hold of me. I should have heard my cell phone ring, when it was sitting right next to me, but I was so busy with the keyblade that I tuned every other noise out except the sounds of Daffy Duck yelling "Sora!".
