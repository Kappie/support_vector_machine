While waiting to be seen by one of the doctors, I realized that Sakdary has been checked out by one of the new doctor. I pretend that I didn’t notice anything and minded my own business. I try not to make any eye contacts and sort of hide my face by turning away so that he wont be able to take a good look at me.    Had an x-ray by one of the nurses, I must say she’s pretty cute. She smelled real good. After the x-ray I had to sit in the waiting room again. Walking past that cute doctor I avoid eye contacts again. Five minutes later he called me in which wasn’t so odd. Introduced ourselves with a hand shake and blare with a smile.    Upon opening my mouth for him, he did so many things to my mouth that I haven’t had a clue. All I could do was lye there and open wide, look at him, at the ceiling or just close my eyes. I hate the noisy drills, it kinda scares me away. For every time his about to stick something inside, I twitch.    I’ve always wanted to see what the heck doctors do to you while you are just lying there. I mean what the hell are they looking or doing. I know that they for sure know what their doing but I was just very curious. Out of no where he asked, “How old are you?” I was puzzled. 23 I answered. Then another question flew out, “Are you married?”…ummm, NO… I thought to myself, what was that? Where did all of that come from? Sure he was a cute doctor but I’m still puzzled by his questions.   Overall, he was real nice to explain to me that I don’t have any cavity, and I wont have to make another appointment until 6 months later. Then he said,” I think you should make an appointment with me on your next visit”. Haha…. I said thankyouverymuch and I’ll see you in six months and I took off…   That was much unexpected; does a doctor always ask their patience’s weird questions like that???
