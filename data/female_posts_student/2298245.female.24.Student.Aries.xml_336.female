But I'm too angry, and it's too personal to talk about at the moment.  But I will overcome this.  I complained to a gracious friend, I'm refusing to do work for the rest of the night - instead, I'm watching The Chamber of Secrets on HBO.  Then more TV, and then bed.  I think I might eat some ice cream and stuff, and then clean my room up.  That always makes me feel better, and keeps my mind off of things.  I know how to ward off the evil, bad thoughts.  So if you'll excuse me...
