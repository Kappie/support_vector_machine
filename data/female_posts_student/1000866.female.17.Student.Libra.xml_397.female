I actually got into Social Dance for gym.  That might actually be semi-funny considering it'll probably be all seniors in my class. At least Brandon and Peter will be there.   And during Wind Symphony today, (I played with them again because I have Drivers Ed. Study hall and I had nothing else to practice) I was trying to lift the stand up and it wouldn't budge, so I pulled realllly hard on it, and the top part just came right off and hit me square in the face. Haha, it was SO funny. I wish they would have had it on video. Ah well, it made my day. That and Ashley Richter's story. Hehe.  I missed Chris today. He was gone allll day and I needed to talk to him about something and he wasn't there. Grrr. I wonder what time he's getting home. Hopefully soon.   And, I'm not doing my Satire and Comedy original satire alone anymore. Carson and I are going to work together. I was really surprised when she offered to. I mean...happy...just...surprised. It's going to be really fun working with her.   Hmmm, what else, what else? Our group for homecoming just keeps getting bigger and bigger haha. It's kind of funny. I think we've got 12 people so far. I think it'll be a really fun night and I'm glad Chris and Nikki are coming. That'll make it even better.  Well, I suppose I must go do my laundry...YaY?? Not really. Oh well. I feel like writing more sort of, but I have nothing to write about really. I don't want to complain because I'm in a really good mood but there's nothing more to say about my good mood therefore, I shall stop rambling now. My deepest apologies to anyone who has to sit through these. Well...if anyone even reads them...Hmmm...I really don't know. Ah well. Au revoir.
