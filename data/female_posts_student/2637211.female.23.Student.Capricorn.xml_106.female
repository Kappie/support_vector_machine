I'm thinking this is the next great American novel. It's brilliant, and I can "fictionalize" it all. I need to start writing out ideas about how to write it and what to say. Is this just crazy? Do any of you want to edit it when I get into it? Hmm. I need to brainstorm this more. Also a good excuse to put off school work.
