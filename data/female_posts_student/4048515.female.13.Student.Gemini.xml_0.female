((Yawn)) =_= I'm so tired I got MSN messenger today and I thought I had my friend zoes email but I sent a message and it was some French girl she kept sending messages so I blocked her, yes I no its mean. So stacey if your reading this send me some email addresses I want someone to talk to on msn I went to dancin last night it was really good we're doin a dance to superstar by jameilia but it looks like I'll miss the next 2 classes cause I'm on holiday so I'm really miffed. Any way my mum wants me to have sacha round to night oh I've just had an idea maybe we could go out for a meal but oh sally would need to know so that she could get Josh a babysitter. This morning I started writing a story and I decided that i'd put little bits of it on my blog so hears a little passage from thge first chapter: She had never known her father and had always wished that she could just know who he was just meet him or even just to catch a glimpse of his face see if he was short or if he had blue eyes, anything. All Sarah wanted was to know her father. If you like it leave a comment and I'll post some more of it got to go now                            by me lovelys see ya soon
