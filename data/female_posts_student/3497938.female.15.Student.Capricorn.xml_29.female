I got finshed with it in pretty good time, but I guessed on 12 of the questions. And if you missed 16 you failed... I got an A!!! I only missed 4. Ca you beleive it? I am soooo happy and proud of myself. Life is sooo damn good right now. I have a wonderful boyfriend who treats me like a queen and is sweet and perfect for me, wonderful best friends who love me, im getting along with my family, AND i passed drivers ed. Im soooo happy!
