It feels like it should be 8 or something but yeah. *shrug* Well I had to get up really early to get to the school and get everything ready for the parade n stuff. Sucked. We marched thru Hartley to the Cemetary...it was pointless! We didn't even play anything. But we played like 4 songs at the Cemetary so yeah. Then we went to Melvin and played so more...thats when my feet started to bleed cuz my shoes were killing me. Hurt like hell. So yeah. Then we went to May City. That was pointless to. Wow a croud of like 20 people...maybe. Yeah. And it was soooo windy. We were all falling over. It sucked. It was soo cold too. Eh. I hate this. I hope I never have to do it again. It was torture. So yeah I came home to find out that we got the couch n stuff...this room looks totally different. All we need is the TV and It'll all be good. Tho the couch is kinda ugly..but it was free so yeah. I was just in a bad mood when I found out I couldn't have the TV and the comp on at the same time. My parents are dumb. They think it'll start a fire or something. *shrug* W/e...we'll figure something out. So yeah...then I just kicked back the rest of the day. To windy to tan :( So yeah. Well only 4 more days of school/hell. *sigh* I really wanna be done n over with it. Im sooo sick of school. Probably fail every test this week..but does it look like I care? No. I don't give a damn bout school anymore...Once May hit..I've already been out of it. Hence the low Algebra grade. Its only a C but thats super low for me but yeah. I just wanna get out. Hopefully this summer will go better for me. Hopefully I'll have Kait come n stay all of next week and then its the thing in Grinnell so I'll keep busy. I guess thats good. I just need my tan! I look so white right now. :( Oh well I'll get it in time. Well...I have nothing else to ramble bout...
