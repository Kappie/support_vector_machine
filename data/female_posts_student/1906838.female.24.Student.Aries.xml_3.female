I had stayed up till 6 this morning preparing the powerpoint presentation for the case presentation, by which we willbe assessed.Crawled into bed at 6 am feeling rather pleased with what my work and hoping that it would help me get a good grade.  Everyone else but me and Ben had their presentations in floppies. Ben had just bought his thumbdrive because he had a faulty floppy disc during our Dermy presentation and decided that a brand new thumbdrive couldnt possibly go faulty at the last minute. i had my work saved in sharizal's thumbdrive,as usual cos i was using his pc last night( my pc doesnt have powerpoint). when ben went up to present, he discovered that the laptop we were using this morning had a USB port but the driver software had not been installed. poor ben.. that was the second time this sort of thing had happened to him. but fortunately he had his presentation printed out so he just read it out from there.  all this while i was crapping in my pants .. i didnt have a hard copy of my presentation and my case notes were scattered .. i asked the tutor if i could possibly go to one of the offices and transfer my work into a floppy and he didnt seem convinced that the other comps in the hospital were equipped with working USB ports either. guess that just left me with one option ...TALK ABOUT MY PATIENT using whatever notes i had with me,just like ben had .. except my notes were really in a mess!!!so talked i did ..and omigod did i feel soo stupid!!! fortunately, the tutor was nice and didnt give me a hard time.  i managed to talk thru' the important details .. well the ones that i could remember..but now i just feel soooo INDIGNANT that i had worked so hard on that presentation and didnt get to show it off to the rest of the group.oh well.. padan my own muka ( serves me right!) for being so silly and complacent.if there is a lesson to learn from what had happened today , it is TO ALWAYS HAVE BACKUP.   i have never had this sort of prob with USB ports before. dont know if it is just a coincidence or are the comps at this particular hospital as chronologically gifted as its residents?
