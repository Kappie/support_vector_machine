Its like 45 degrees outside, which is really warm for February in Chicago. I got my hair low-lighted on Tuesday. It looks good, but you can barely tell that I got it done, especially for paying $75. Oh man, I was watching "America's Next Top Model" yesterday. That show is hysterical! They had to go to this acting class thing, and pretend this piece of paper was a letter from someone they had issues with. They all started crying uncontrollably, and it was SO FUNNY. It was just so dramatic and overdone. It was hilarious. They took one look at this blank sheet of paper and started crying. Now that is good television, my friends. Anyways, I think thats it. I have a massive algebra test tomorrow. Yuck. Mr.Snoeck is in Kentucky, so all we do in wind ensemble is "sectionals", in which we do absolutley nothing. Its fun. Meh. So Jasmine and I are going to the Westfield Solo and Ensemble recital tonight. It well, should be interesting at least.
