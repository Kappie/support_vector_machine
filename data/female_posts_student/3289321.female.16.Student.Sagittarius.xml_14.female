It's cool, sometimes a certain song comes to mind whenever i see a particular person.  Like for a certain SOMEONE, i think of these lyrics:  You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen You've got me almost melting away ^"I love you always forever" - Donna Lewis ;-)  It was also one of those days when even when something really made me mad, i got over it quickly..maybe it's because i was thinking about "someone" all day, who knows.  i can only hope that he was and is doing the same.  Well, I'm gonna go watch a movie...God bless!  Later  >  P.S. Benny B-feel better!!
