It was like one of those late night convos you have with your best friend and when you wake up in the morning you just feel so great. Today, i helping my parents with stuff for my aunts garage sale and we took stuff down to Huntington. I got to drive home which was fun. Then we went out to dinner and that's it. What a life..haha. I just rode 5 miles on my bike and watched How To Deal. I'm really tired so i might go to bed soon. Tomorrow we're going to the lake all day and Sunday is church and packing since we leave for San Francisco on Tuesday. Everyone have a good weekend.
