When i'm feeling down,  You are always there to catch me when I fall When i'm alone, And needed a friend,  To help me through, You are always there, By my side.  When i thought i'm losing it all, Your hands of love they guide me through, The good and the bad, You're the bestest friend that i've ever had, Whenever i need You, You're always there  Whenever i needed love, YOu always shine Your light upon my face. Through the darkest times, You are always there, Towards me, to guide me, In my heart, I'll always know,  That You are always there.
