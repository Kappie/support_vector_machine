Maybe I am sick of this sunburned, straw-haired, makeup free, dry clothing free, chlorine flavored, rough skinned version of myself. I'm a Scorpio, how could I not enjoy the swimming? It's the disastrous effects of the pool I can't stand anymore. I guess the only other reason is because the filter has been off for like, three days for some weird reason, and it looks really green.  this morning as I was half awake, I had the most fabulous dream. shane came over to my house((my old house, not my grandmother's)) for dinner and we sat in the living room and talked. He told me that he had taken a job as a flamenco dancer to earn some extra cash. So then we danced around my house and we had on these crazy costumes and then I woke up. I miss him.  lately I've been thinking about mixed marriages/children. I was thinking about how eventually, the whole world will be one big super-race, a mixture of all the cultures. We will speak the same language, but different dialects depending on where we were originally from. It will be a sad place, where there is no true diversity, where mixing genetics will produce new diseases, set new standards of normalcy, beauty.   when you see a child with one black parent and one white, you can always tell. They are a new kind of different that the world hasn't really noticed yet. I feel bad when I see them being picked on. I feel bad when I think about how someday the "mixed" people will need their own revolution against prejudice.   sometime this year I watched a show about midget couples who have children and lead seminormal lives. What are they thinking by having children?!? They know the pain and suffering that goes along with being different, and they are selfish enough to bring a child into the world to endure the same? Why not adopt? Why not save a healthy orphan from a loveless childhood? Not all midgets turn out to be cute little people either! They are born with limb and spine deformities which inhibit them from living the way they want to. to think that people will do that sickens me. Of course, dear folks, I have nothing against midgets. I merely used them as an example to show this problem which, although it may seem small now, will eventually change the world. I am not a bigot either, I have no problems with any minorities, ect. But really, people, think about what you're doing BEFORE you do it.   if you are such a selfish asshole that you think you must procreate and have your OWN child regardless of how the child will turn out, be it their backgrounds and lives or anything medical, then you should really take a look at yourself.  thinking about adoption has got me thinking about gay marriages. Since I'm not gay, I guess I don't have that strong of an opinion, but for me, I think there's no reason why they shouldn't be allowed. I think that homosexuals are just normal people who have every right to get married whether it's for moral, financial, or religious reasons. I also feel that the adoption rate will go up with so many couples who are unable to have children for... Obvious reasons. The other side of that argument is that having gay parents will corrupt the children and make them all gay. That's a load of crap. Homosexuality is not a choice, it's the result of chemical abnormalities((for lack of a better word)) in the brain. End of story.  hmm... I wonder how many people I have offended with this post.
