(1) I have experimented with my hair more... pretty adventurous. Let it grow out or a while, but then cut it short again. And I learned how to do an updo!  (2) I swear more, but only when the situation merits a good curse word. First time I've ever said fuck in front of my parents, ouch.  (3) Got and lost my first "real" boyfriend, Mr. Kenneth Carvahlo... a lot of firsts...haha (4) Began my driving rendezvous! Can get my license on September 1!  (5) Began and quit my first job at the infamous Hardees. Better forgetten.  (6) I have become much much more rebellious-- skipping class and the like. :-)   almost   got my first detention.  (7) I actually had the nerve to tell the deemed "senior king" Peter off because I can't stand his egotistical ass.  (8) Went to both homecoming and prom     with a date! (9) I rode my first rollercoaster ever this year-- and it just so happened to be the biggest in the world. Millennium!  (10) I went away from home, to Chicago Illinois to be exact, with my Model United Nations team. Mom cried. I loved it-- well, not her crying, but the trip. (11) I won awards at both Kent State and YSU this year all by myself! (12) Dancing-- ahem-- that one will remain exclusive between me and a few others who shall remain unnamed.  (13) I got accepted to the National Honor Society and while I did not deem it as my accomplishment of the year, my parents were happy. (14) I made 2nd singles on the varsity tennis team and won 3rd all NEC. Kicked this girls ass from Lakeside, some fat chick who had a mean forehand... enough said. Hey, I was proud.
