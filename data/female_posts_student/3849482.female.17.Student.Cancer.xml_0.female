It's funny how colleges are described differently by different sources. Unfortunately, as a person who can be somewhat gullible, I have come across a dilemma. I mean, it is obvious that the tour guide and staff of the college will try to convince prospective students of attending, but at the same time, wouldn't they have a better perspective on the school than a book full of statistics and quotes from select individuals? *sighs* Who knows?  Besides, I  still  have no idea as to what I want to major in... Dale says English, Carolyn has always said fashion design, and my parents constantly come up with random (yet "stable") professions that I'm not sure if I would even be good at, but the one person who should know which major I should choose does not know... College is already upsetting me and I have a whole year before it actually starts.  Today I taught my first violin lesson. It wasn't great, but I suppose it could have been worse. I wish I didn't have so much work over the summer. It probably is one of the main reasons as to why I never feel like doing anything. It tires me out so that I either end up sleeping "early" or falling asleep in the middle of the afternoon. :`( I really hope I go  somewhere. I don't even care too much as to where, but I need a break. After all, wasn't that the point of having a summer vacation?
