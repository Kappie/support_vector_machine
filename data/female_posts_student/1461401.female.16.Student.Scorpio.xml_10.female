She wasn't nneeaarr as good as me. Butt love...heeheehee, that's priceless. I finally got my Anthem project turned in (it was due today) but I still have my midevil project thing due tuesday and I'm no where near done with that. I realized tonight how much I miss the way things were before my incredible stupidity. I mean, things have gotten much better, almost back to the way things once where, but it's still different. Dylan licked me. I had to lick her back to get me to stop... not my proudest moment, but I washed my hands afterwards, so I'm ok... I hope... Oh god, is that a wart where she licked me?!?!? heeheehee, sorry dylan ~Kristin
