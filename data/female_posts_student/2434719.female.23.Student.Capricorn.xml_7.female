NO MORE BEER!  none.   there is no beer in the do it plan. none. ohhhh there's  water  in the do it plan, but you don't want water, you want beer. and there is NO beer in the do it plan.  cornbread, ain't nothin wrong with that. :) (or my other favorite: "take off that silly ass hat.")  i did have quite a fun weekend with jason though. i just want to pinch his cheeks and give him a juice pack sometimes. untill he starts talking... then i have to slap him.   ARE YOU COOL? DO YOU LIKE MUSIC? DO YOU LIKE ME?   IF YOU ANSWERED YES TO TWO OF THOSE QUESTIONS... my cousin casey, has a cd out that i want everyone to buy.  go to  urlLink http://www.caseyconnor.org  and you can read about it and even purchase online.  yipee skipee.  yeah so www.fitday.org. obsessed. i enter everything i eat, and it keeps track of my calories for me...  okay enough of that. i have a real life, i promise.  so i have this paper due in less than week now... have i started it? i think you know the answer to that one... but that's my life. worrying about this paper...   ooooh watch the daily show tonight! just do it, it's going to be great (richard clarke is going to be on! how did they do that?).... what's also great, is tomorrow karen hughes, WHOM I'VE MET AND BOUGHT PANTYHOSE FOR, is going to be on.... amazing! just watch with me, and be happy. and of course the one and only johnny knoxville will be on thursday night, yipeeeeeee.  oooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhh my word i am soooooooooooo nervous. i'm going to get a make or break exam grade back on thursday. i'm feeling okay about grades cause i did get an acceptable grade on a paper i got back yesterday.  i wish it was better though. oh well.  time to get out of here, do some research for the damn paper and start writing it. I WILL MAKE THIS PAPER MY BITCH. (it's weird saying that, since it's on the passion of hte christ. i take it back out of catholic school guilt).  ooh yeah. okay. i know i don't talk about anything personal on here, but yeah, here's a little bit of info just to get it out. i talked to someone for like 3 hours on sunday... and man, i'm so happy :).  i'm so happy about the way my life is going. and it just gives me hope, for those moments where i feel discouraged, becuase i think back about my past wants, the things i thought i needed, i thought i couldn't live without... and i don't have it, and I'M SO DAMN HAPPY that's true.  so for those days, that i'm sad, and heartbroken, i know there's light at the end of that long, dark, cold, rainy, miserable, rat-infested, moldy, hell of a tunnel called love. :)   the end.
