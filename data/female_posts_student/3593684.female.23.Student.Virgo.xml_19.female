And was still a little drunk at 6am when the friend was supposed to pick me back up for work. I'm my haze I said, don't bother to pick me up, Jen lives on the westside, she can get me to work. Unfortunately, that haze wore off two hours later when I realized that Jen was on a plane to seattle, as were most of the other summer associates. So I took a cab to work on friday morning (didn't realize how expensive that would be!). And then I left I for Las Vegas at 4pm that afternoon. So I am hung-over, in Vegas, spending money I don't have and having a generally good time nonetheless. I made it to bed around 4 am. And I had the weirdest dreams. And you were in on them. I had a dream that I was at a party. And I was pouring this delicious dark beer (I don't even like beer in waking hours). And there were all these beautiful people all over, and I was dressed up and laughing and having a good time. And there was a guy I was flirting with and he was laughing and having a good time. And then I looked over in the corner and saw you sitting there. You had on jeans and white t-shirt with your dark green button up shirt over it and your brown suede jacket. And I thought, what the hell is he doing here? But not in a bad way, just in an extremely surprised sort of way. And I was trying to get across the room to say hi and I kept getting involved in all of the trite conversations and by the time I made it to where you had been you were already gone. And then it struck me. I wasn't having a good time at all. I was miserable and lonely. And then I woke up. And I was in a strange bed in a strange town and you weren't there and I felt very very very alone. Anyway. I am going to see the Magnetic Fields tonight, and then Modest Mouse on Monday night and the old 97s on wednesday. I have been spending so much time going out that I hardly have a moment alone. And yet, I also feel extremely isolated. I guess I am coming to understand that many of my daily interactions are ultimately empty ones. And I find myself wishing I were home. Except I don't really have a home anymore, so I guess I wish that I could feel at home.  There's a lot more I want to tell you, but I suppose this is getting a little bit overly sentimental. I do want to say that I miss being around you. I know I acted crazy sometimes, but for the most part you had a really calming effect on me. And being with you was the closest thing I felt to being at home.  If I haven't been calling all that often it's because I am trying to give you time and space to figure things out. I admit that I used to get really angry when you wouldn't call. I had a difficult time understanding your position. I think maybe I am begining to have geniune empathy for what you are going through. I've gone of several dates this last month, and things that could have been dates if I hadn't stopped them from making a move. And even though I am sure they are all nice people, I just can't quite bring myself to fully interact with them because... well because I miss you and want to be with you and they just aren't you.  And I've also been talking with Rod fairly often. And now I am begining to see what you mean about needing time and space. Because looking back at how things turned out with pete, a huge part of it was my inability to let go out how I felt about rod.  Finally, I am really annoying when I am drunk. Especially when you are sober. Since you have to drive every where in LA we take turns being designated driver. Wow, drunk people are really annoying.  sorry about all of those drunken phone calls and puke/babysitting sessions.  Okay. So those are my life lessons for the week. I don't really know why I am writing you all of this. Maybe it is just because that dream was so vivid and that really horrible feeling of not being able to talk to you has stuck with me all day.  It would be nice if you would write or call. But I understand if fiss is keeping you busy or if the weight of hot humid new haven air has drained your strength away and you can't bring yourself to respond. yours truly,   katherine -------------  Wish I hadn't sent it. I hate all the crap you have to pretend you don't feel. i hate this game of giving space. and acting cool. and happy. well. i'm not happy.
