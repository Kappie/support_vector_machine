At first i knew my best friend was     ed at me and she had something 2 tell me b/c everyone said she did, then she saw me after 8th period and told me that she didnt wanna b friends ne more. So i had to go tothe entire practice trying to like hold in how i was feeling, then when i got home my sister said that she called and that i should call her back at 7:30. Well at like 7:00 i get a phone call and it was christina and she was like look i know b4 i said that we couldnt be friends but i dont think i could do that, and she was like i wanna be best friends again... and now i feel so much better like nothing happened b/c it was my fault she was mad and i totally understood but when she pulled that lets not b friends ne more card i was sooooo freaked out. Man am i lucky have  such kool chilled friends. Man i feel so much better i dont even care that i was grounded. Life is SWEET!!! lol
