I have already tried to post two, but, there was some retard interference. There is something about a drunk American Indian/Irish guy that really brings you into a happy mood.  Ian's greatest math equation ->   Irish blood + American Indian blood = Biggest drunk on earth   I wouldn't doubt that his head is laying on his computer keyboard right now.
