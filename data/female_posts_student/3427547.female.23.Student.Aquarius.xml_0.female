And I am very pumped about it because it is really close (by car) to where Janet lives. So I got a ride to work with Janet today at 7 and arrived at 7:30. My boss was really great and very nice and gave me a schedule. I'll be getting off most days at 3:15 and on others at 4:30. Today I got off at 3:15pm. The arrangements today were that I was to take the bus from the warehouse, transfer to the train, then transfer back to a new bus to get home. But the thing is, the bus came early, and everybody at CP who takes the bus missed it, including me. The next bus didn't come for 35 minutes, so I thought: the drive was really short, I'll walk home.   I think in my head the drive was a lot shorter, because the walk took almost 2 hours. And here's the kicker. I was less than 30 seconds away from the house when I second guessed myself and became convinced I wasn't going the right way. So one secret room away from the treasure, so to speak, I turned around, walked through a wrong strange neighborhood for half an hour, went back to the last familiar intersection and hit the convenience store. I called Janet at work first because it was 5:15ish. Too late, I had missed her. I figured she wasn't home yet, so I called a cab. I waited and waited and waited and it never came. Probably becasue it was 45 minutes till game time and everyone in this city was trying to get home really fast. Then I called Janet at home..busy. So I saw the Safeway across the street and thought: I need a few things to add to my lunches. So I walked over and picked them up. At the Safeway there was a direct line to a cab. I called it and they gauranteed 10 minutes. A good 20-25 minutes later I caught one and took it back. The worst part was I knew that everyone in the family would be home having dinner and would probably make a fuss if I revealed I had gotten lost. Plus I was so embarrassed. So I fibbed a bit which I never do and I'm being eaten by guilt right now. All I can hear in my head is Vince saying adamantly GOD HATES IT WHEN YOU LIE. aaaaaah! I said I had been shopping and then walked up Falconridge. What a dork I am. I was so embarrassed though, and I didn't want anyone to feel bad because I got wonderful directions about the bus, I just missed it!! I think I came off as appearing to not care about being home in time for supper.  Plus I shot any small amounts of time to spend with Janet this evening. I suckkkkkk!!!!!!! aaaarg! I am vowing to never do this again.    They saved me supper, that was awesome.  Ok. Tomorrow is a new day. :-) GOD FORGIVE ME FOR BEING A SUPREME RETARD.
