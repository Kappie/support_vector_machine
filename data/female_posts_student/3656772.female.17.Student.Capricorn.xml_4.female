     
      (For anyone who doesn't know me)     I'm a 5'4 girl with short blonde hair and blue-green eyes. My passions are swing dancing, drawing, some writing, telemark skiing, hiking, biking, reading, camping, rafting, water skiing, playing in the ocean, hanging with friends and painting.   (Told you it was short)
