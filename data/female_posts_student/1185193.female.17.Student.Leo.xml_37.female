Two things I am proud of about myself today at the gym: I jogged at an incline of 8.0 for 30 mintues on the treadmill, and I did a total on 100 reps on the thigh machine using 60 pounds.  This dancing queen is young, sweet, AND strong!  Which brings me to my next point.  Does anyone know what April 24th is? (Besides the 3 month countdown to my birthday).  Yes, you guessed it.  It's the highly anticipated Junior Prom.  I was pretty sure of who I was going to ask.  Yes, I was definetly sure.  Unfortunately, my friend beat me to him.  What is a dancing queen to do?   There's this other guy, let's call him "Dixon."  (hehe, got that one from Alias).  Dixon and I used to hang out a lot at school this year, until my schedule changed.  Now it's just a short Hello in the hallway.  But I'm just looking for a friend to go with.  Things will work out with someone somehow *fingers crossed*  I am so excited because I am going to be helping Señora Karazija with her spanish classes.  She was my teacher at SMT in junior high.  She was an inspiration to me, and I  feel totally blessed to be able to work along side of her.  Algún día debo escribir una entrada de Blog en español.  ¿Alguien conoce bien la idioma?  Pues, no puedo escribir ahora porque muchas personas me están charlando en AIM.  Hablaré más tarde.
