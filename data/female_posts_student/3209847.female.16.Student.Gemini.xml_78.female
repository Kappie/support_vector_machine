GO TAYLOR!!  uhh, so today i went to the doctor to get my tb test and meningitis vaccine for northwestern.  they didn't get my file, so hopefully they'll have it when i go back friday to read the test.  i have to fill out almost an entire medical history for school and i need my file for that.  that's pretty much all that's been going on in my life... exciting, huh?  god i'm so dull.  somebody please call me before i fall into a pattern of sloth.  oh wait, too late.  love you taylor!
