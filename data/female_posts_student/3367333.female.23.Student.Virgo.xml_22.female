(actually, i'm quite sure i'm not, but it's the people who apply who matter). anyway, i just think it sucks that i can't even try. okay, so that's just me being stupid. on the upside, i saw three fab shows at the fringe today: pith is absolutely amazing in all respects -- well written, well performed, funny (at times even painfully funny), and touching -- and certainly my favorite show thus far; i also saw three ring circus, which was both funny and intelligent -- a rare combination given the subject matter (the israeli-palistinian situation from the pov of a young jew); finally, i saw jem rolls,a really amazing performance poet from britain. i've been on a bit of a spending spree lately, spending money i can't really afford to, actually. i'm doing this partly because i just gave away two-thirds of my wardrobe (the two-thirds that hasn't fit since very shortly after i moved here) and i'm not sure why i'm doing the rest of it...iam, however, starting to feel guilty, and i haven't even paid for my bus ticket back to t.o. yet. actually, i know why i'm doing some of it: i'm sick and tired of being a broke student, and i feel like i'm working wayharder than many people, and i'm really tired of depriving myself when i see others indulging. i really need to grow up and pull myself together, no?
