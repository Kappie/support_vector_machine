All you get is a bunch of numbers, symbols, headaches and other shitty stuff like that. Like, what purpose will they serve in my life?! OK, here's an example. Question: If you find yourself with two boyfriends, what do you do? Choose the best formula to solve the problem.   GUIDELINES:  A= boyfriend 1 B= boyfriend 2 C= boyfriend 1  boyfriend 2 0= you are so dead meat   CHOICES:  a. A+B=C=0 b. A/B=0 c. B/C=A d. 0/C=A=B   ANSWER:  A  Math makes life so much easier, right? It soo solves everything!!! It's so great!!! -duh. yeah, right.-
