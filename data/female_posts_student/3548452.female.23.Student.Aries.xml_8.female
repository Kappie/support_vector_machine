I'm spillin my guts here- if you dont like it that's too bad. Well I met someone new last weekend and needless to say, considering the drought that has been goin on strong for 6 months, I ended it. Um, he looks kinda like an old roommate (strictly platonic) that I kinda ended on bad terms with. Well things are in that "mushy" stage where you just get all hot and bothered when you see him and funny things happen to your body. He doesnt help when he's messin with me either. He's the karaoke host at Arts. He's also 11 years older than me so I have to watch out for old hags AND the young broads. I'm sitting at the table and the chick across from me tells me she dated him last year. I looked at her and then looked at him and I'm like wtf? What was he thinkin? and if he likes girls like that, why is he tryin to talk to me? I sure can pick em huh? Anyway, so I've been talkin about the ex-roomie because the friend looks kinda like him... And then I got to thinkin about the rumor that our next door neighbor started saying he kicked me out of the house 'cause I wouldnt sleep with him. It was totally untrue, not that I wouldnt sleep with him- he's a slut beyond most sluts. Not sayin he isnt hot tho. :D So because of that rumor, he had his kid's mom try to jump me at my favorite bar- not a good idea. Well he showed up as I'm bein all mushy with the karaoke guy at my table... waits around a while for me to speak- but when I dont, and the karaoke guy is long gone, he plops himself down in front of me. Even gave me a hug! what's up with that? Claiming his territory or something??? Beats me! It did occur to me that maybe because Scott saw the guy, he kinda got upset that someone was all over me and decided to invite one of his old hags up to the bar 'cause some lady seemed to take all his attention and people seemed to be kinda keeping her preoccupied when she came in. He's not my man, so I really dont care, but when I think about the events the night we slept together, it makes me wonder just who he's been with and so I'm not likely to have a recapp of that night. Then, everybody at Hiller's plotted against me and now I'm pissed off at them and i'm never going back for real. I was gonna visit occaisionally now that I have a job, but nope. My friend Rae asked me to go out and when I called her she was at Hillers- no big deal. Cylinthia was also there- major problem. She gave me this big sob story about how she misses me and she feels like a piece of her life is missing yada, yada, yada.... See, back in like, November, she and I got into a fight- which her new friend instigated... and she called me a "nigger-bitch" and almost killed me trying to drive me home while she was tripping. So what was the fight about? I was trying to help her out by not letting her argue with her boyfriend or his brother- and I happened to be talking to the brother at the time. He's asking me where we are and I'm trying to distract his attention- of course since nobody knew what I was talking about its kinda funny how her friend started telling her that I was talking about her and her boyfriend and she flipped out. It's also really funny how that same friend that she had been complaining about because she was trying to be "just like her" was all of a sudden her best friend and I was the one who was getting treated like a liar. I've never lied to that girl in my life and I was already in shock that she would even believe someone who was irritating her over me, but it was too late. She believed that girl above me even though we've been through so much together. That girl took me out partying so many times and almost got me in trouble. I've had stuff slipped in my drink, almost been raped (and I'm not even sure to this day if I was or not- thank goodness I didnt catch anything if I was), I've stuck by her through lots and this is how I get repaid- AGAIN. It makes  me wonder what I'm doing here. So she takes me and drops me off in front of my best friend's house- not my house. I'm sitting outside in the cold and her boyfriend's brother calls. We're fighting because of her boyfriend, mind you. He comes and gets me and we get to their house and who's there now? Cylinthia- acting as if nothing even happened. I'm in Jake's room and Abraham comes to the door and asks if Jake's alone- and of course he says yes, but he knows I'm in there. So does Abraham. He asked her to say what she said when I wasnt there and she said, "I'm never talking to that nigger bitch ever again" and he repeated it to make sure I heard. I cried for three hours over that girl and I got my heart broken one more time. So I go home and pick up the pieces and go on with my life. I've seen her since then and she never says a word to me. Now she wants to make up and be friends. I'm not stupid. No way is it gonna happen. To add insult to injury, she actually says she doesnt know what happened and then tries to smooth things over between me and Becky. DO YOU THINK I'M FUCKING STUPID? I hope you dont. :| Sometimes it takes something drastic to get through to these people that I am NOT a punching bag. You think you hurt? I can tell you that when you've spent half your life taking care of other people- including her, keeping her from starving herself and making sure she was okay, there is no worse feeling than to know that you dont mean shit to these people at the end of the day. You're just another player in the game no matter how hard you try. I only have ONE best friend in this whole world, and her name is Hortencia. She has been the only one to stick by me through everything and she would never disrespect or hurt me that way and expect me to be okay with it. That's just stupid. That Becky girl? I'm supposed to be okay with her and hang out with the two of you after she instigated a huge fight, got you so pissed at me that you couldnt see straight, you actually tell me that if I want to get out of your car, I better jump out and you refuse to even stop at red lights- and I'm supposed to just let it go? I forgave a long time ago, I have no choice, but I damn sure dont have to forget how I felt that day. I will never forget. You will be lucky if you get to be more than a piece of shit that I scraped off the bottom of my shoe now. One too many times and I dont have to deal with you just because you come to me crying. I wonder if Jake even told her that I left him a voicemail telling him that if he couldnt let it go, we couldnt speak. I'm tired of getting my heart broke and gettin stepped on because I love people so much that I just cant let them go. It's time to cut them loose 'cause I realize now, if it were me? they'd drop me in a heartbeat. No questions asked, right Cylinthia? This is one hellatious vent. I gotta go. :D
