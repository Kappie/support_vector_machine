I walk in this morning, barely 8 o'clock, I haven't even had my first cup of coffee.  Anne, the office manager, comes up to me and says "I have a personal question for you."  Instantly I panick and start to wonder what on earth it could be.  "Uh, yes?"  "Are you seeing anyone?  Becuase you know I have this friend whose son would be  perfect  for you.  He's really smart and funny and oh, he's good looking.  I told him all about you last night, he's looking forward to meeting you."  "Well, I'm seeing someone.  Almost 2 months now.  He's really great."  "Oh..."  Last week one of my mother's friends who works here tried to set me up with one of the building maintenance guys.  He's really nice and kind of cute, but where you all of you people in December when I was single?
