It is expected, it is as if we know what is going to happen. I'm used to it though and I'm more defiant. So he circled the room, each time taking up a piece of work to comment. I had no idea why is he doing that? I mean, he's a teacher, isn't he? He's suppose to  teach  other than comment. When he came round my table, he took up my piece of work and began criticising. I  didn't  do that bad... did I? So when the bell rang, he asked for the work he wanted and he yelled like a maniac. Everybody did something and pass it up, all except me but I didn't bother about it and drive all his thoughts out of my mind. We all possessed a glummy look as I asked around for support of not completing his assignment. But I found none. Those who passed up were relieved and others were busy scribbling something down during recess. I don't get it at all. Is he that fierce!? I admit if he started yelling and shouting out of the blue, it is something to be afraid of. But that depends. This is ridiculous. Following was Chinese lesson which we spent the one period to learn the spelling and another for spelling itself. Right after was maths, which I'm extremely puzzled and confused with. What is she talking about? What ever.. Then is moral education which everybody greeted cheerfully. We were all excited about the baking of cookies as charity for the food and fun fair. We discussed about the items paid and it was settled for the next thursday. Then when I went down the stairs, I saw him. Now I know why people think he's shuai. His charming face, his bulging big eyes and his friendly appearence, his hairstyle...all were part of his fashion. My heart skipped a beat as our eyes met and I continued down the stairs, feeling my face going warm and blushing. He is  shuai  afterall!! lol. Did I really fall in? I'm so not sure...But I AM NOT. It's such a pleasure to be in the same school and cca with him. After that was the history common test which went through well enough [apart from miss yani's first ever shout] but I can't gurantee I will pass and score well. He was outside, there, waiting for our pieces of work. Most of the people went off, even people like harold and zhen ye. I really dunno why they will do his work. So I asked and all he wanted was to see how much we can write in 2 periods of time. Simple enough. But why do he have to yell and shout? So I hurried down the stairs, hoping for the band room to be opened but it was not. So I went home along with the gang instead. Yuhui and Jiayi quarreled over a minor matter. IT's so trival. It was really not worth to be mad about it. Though I do admit Jia Yi can be insensitive at times. So Jiayi headed off with a whiff and yuhui was mad with anger. God. Why things can be so easily solved yet complicated at times?? Yuhui got her mother to fetch her and Jaslyn had to buy ice cream for her mum. LOL. I'm going to morning call her!! haha. At a very very very early and unexpected time! As I strolled back to the bus stop, alone, I'm thinking...I'm really confused. which one? really...
