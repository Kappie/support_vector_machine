"..I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak, And this bottle of beast Is taking me home  I'm cuddling close To blankets and sheets But you're not alone, and you're not discreet Make sure I know who's taking you home.  I'm reading your note over again There's not a word that I comprehend, Except when you signed it "I will love you always and forever."  Well As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder How you're making out But as for me, I wish that I were anywhere with anyone Making out.."   alright guys sorry this wasnt the best entry ever but im kinda tired and i have a lot of things on my mind. see yall tomorrow  jess
