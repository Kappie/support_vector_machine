I went to see the movie on friday and we got there id say 1/2 and hour earlier and i told my mom "there are goin to be NO seats left" she said "yah ther will be" so we get in and exzactly how many seats r not sat in 1 {and it was saved} so we go to the next showing and get ther and hour and a half just to sit in a line that was going inot the thearter. Well i was fairly dissapointed with the movie. I mean it was GREEEEEEAT! but it didnt follow the book too well. The way harry got the broom was a little different in the book they take it away and test it and all this shit and I dont think there was ennough emphasis on how "horrible" sirus was said to be i mean they didnt even show him "attack" Ron in the bed when neville left the list of passwords around. I guess to say as a fan {though not as bad as the kids dressed up w/ gryffindor scarves and such {i soooooo wanted to join them} and as a fan i was pissed with the movie. I guess if u get into the books u will NEVER be completly satisfied with the movie.  Ill let you know i was sooooo glad there was "romantic" tension between ron and hermonie... .......I am pissed to hear they may change the actors who play the kids........{they say they r getting too old as if } i will not go if they change the actors it wont be the same
