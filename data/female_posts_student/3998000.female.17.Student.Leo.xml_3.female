I've been liking everything I've been doing so the normal isn't a bother to me but a little change is more than welcome.  Tonight was definately a little different.  Getting to know someone is like getting into a pool that could be ice cold.  Tonight I stuck my big toe into the water and found out its pretty luke warm, I think.  A very smart person (who just so happens to be very talented with an ice cream pricing machine) told me that instead of sticking my foot in next I should just go in to the knee.  I wonder what that means. HA, I'm sure I'll figure it out.  I just hope its all figured out by the time I leave (12 days and counting).  If not, then I guess it will have to be figured out during "weekend trips".  Whats really interesting is how people go about getting to know one another.  Its no longer "Do you want to come play at my house? I have the new lego set!", or "Do you want to sleep over?".  These days strong emotions get intertwined into these words, they mean so much more than the actual meaning.  It was nice for "Do you want to join me for ice cream?" actually mean that.  I hope it stays that way and I hope life continues in this basic routine, with a surprise thrown in there every once in a while.   Maybe I'll step into the water a little further with each surprise down the way.  The sparks of new and exciting stuff are so much brighter if you seize them for everything they are.  Meanwhile this routine is done.  Its time for bed so that I can wake up, drive, do the chores, go to work.    Buona Notte.
