He works with me until the 22nd of August.  Anyway, I just needed a male perspective.  I need one just about everyday to try and understand this.  If he didn't want to hang out why take the number.  I don't.  I really don't.  If some guy offers me his number and I'm not interested I say no thanks, I'm seeing someone.  If that doesn't work I'll take it, but by then I'm sure he's aware that the odds of him getting a call from me are slim to none.  So, just say no.  No. No. No, you have a right to say no!! I hate this.  I hate dating.  See why I said it before.  This is why.  I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!!!!!  Well, my brother and I start our new jobs tomorrow night and I don't really have time to go into detail with anything, so I guess I'll have to update this during the weekend sometime.  PEACE!!!
