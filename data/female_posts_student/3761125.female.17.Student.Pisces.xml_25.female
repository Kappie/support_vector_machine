I don't like them THAT much though... in fact, I'm slightly bored with most of my CDs right now. I need something new and exciting.   Secret Machines   were doing it for me for quite a while (and still are), I won't ever get sick of them, they're just incredible. Period. But, I need something new still. I feel like I'm in a music-rut... ever had one of those? Somebody recommend a band. NOW!Please?        I really appreciate and have a lot of respect for GOOD rock journalism. I've found that with magazines such as Spin or Rolling Stone; the articles are repetitive and lack creativity and quirkiness; two characteristics I NEED when reading an article (especially about a band/artist) or else I just get bored after the first paragraph and move on. What I love about  Filter   is that the journalism is intelligent, quirky, funny and not to mention- you can really tell the writer has enjoyed writing the article. The magazine talks mostly about music (CD reviews, getting to know certain bands, feature articles, photography) and they always discuss two films (usually aninterview with the director). They've talked about    Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Coffee  Cigarettes, Garden State, Before Sunset, The Saddest Music in the World   ... etc. In other words: Fucking good stuff.        Just some of my favorite parts from articles I've read in the magazine:    [From   Getting to know   The Veils article in issue 11]        What's most troubling about music at the moment, owing to its being co-opted by lunkheads and milksops, is that the poetry is virtually gone. Not "poetry" poetry (God help us), but the sense that music has the ability to present itself in both an Expressionist and esoteric manner at once. Rather, we're forced to endure nu-metal oafs and emo whiners ranting on with a mind-boggling lack of complexity, plaintive-but-simplistic singer-songwriter whimpering and, worst of all, rappers going on about their dicks. It's enough to make one pray for Cole Porter's resurrection.        Times like these don't bode well for the likes of the Veils, another in a great tradition of emotionally grandiose British pop bands. In fact, 19-year-old ex-pat Aussie singer/guitarist Finn Andrews may be American music fans' worst nightmare: whip-thin, a bit fey, too well-spoken, and far too philosophical for his age. His T-shirt should bear the words, "Ask me about my tortured soul." (His bandmates' T-shirts could read, "I'm with introspective," the proverbial arrow pointing directly at their singer.)...
