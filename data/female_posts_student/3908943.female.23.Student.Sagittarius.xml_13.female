I graduate mid-year so I have to find a job OFF-CAMPUS once I graduate.  I'm living in a house this year instead of a dorm room (excuse me, residence halls - apologies to those of UHDS and Crayola Congress lol) or in an apartment.  And once again I have a roommate after having my own space for a year.  Well, most of the time.        I'm 1 for 2 in the roommate department.  My first roommate from my freshman year was a lunatic.  My roommate that I had my senior year was one of my best friends.  We had our little tiffs once in a great while (I think once or twice actually which is pretty damn good for a year of living together), but overall that was a lot of fun.  So, all of these put together will make it an interesting year for me.  However, I do know that this year will be my last in Macomb (sniff sniff).  Six years is a long time, one quarter of my life has been spent there.  I have to admit, I've loved my time there, and I have been through some big, life-changing events.  But alas, I am being called to another place.  I will (for    the most part) have fond memories of my time there though.      My car had only been home a week when something else went wrong with it.  But I got it back in a couple of hours, so it wasn't a big thing after all, which I am thankful.  Hopefully it will stay together for awhile now.  I love that car, but I think it's real color is yellow.  One day I'll be able to afford a new car.  You know, after earning my 4 bachelor and 2 master degrees.  ;-)      Shout outs to a couple of people - hopefully a congrats is in order for Jason.  You can tell Augy that you are his master now with that new degree.  To James, whatever you are doing with the weather, keep on doing it!!  Oh, and I want to read what you have done in regards to the novel too.    I've decided to start closing my entries with a couple of quotes that I try to live by.        --------    ~"No love, no friendship can cross the path of our destiny without leaving some mark on it forever."    (Francois Mauriac)    ~"Happiness is not something you experience, it's something you remember."   (Oscar Levant)      ~"What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within."  (Oliver Wendell Holmes)
