Now, in order to understand what I’m talking about, you (who are most likely from anywhere but Germany) have to get some background information: First of all, non-German movies or TV-shows on German television are always dubbed.. meaning, if you watch “Friends” you won’t get to hear the actors and actresses’ original voices but some German actors / actresses speaking in German… now, this usually works because we’re doing it so often that we know how to avoid lip asynchrony and such things .. and I have to say, the German voices for the characters of “Friends” have been well chosen.. they come quite close to the original.. but bad examples can be found as well.. for example, Scully (from The X-Files) has a rather high voice in the original.. here in Germany, she has a very low voice, as if she was a heavy smoker or something.. so, the first time a German viewer would see the US original, he or she would be like “holy shit.. how is she talking???”.. But this is not the worst thing.. the problem with recent movies is that the German scripts get worse and worse.. for example, in the US, everybody knows what a Q-Tip is… it’s the same as when someone talks about an “Apple” in Computer Science.. you know that he or she is not talking about a green fruit but about some sort of computer.. now, back to the Q-Tip: in Germany, this is not a common name because other companies sell those things over here and, of course, they can’t use a registered trademark.. so, we have our own word for Q-Tip (which is “Ohrstäbchen”).. now, there’s this TV show called “Scrubs” (used to be on Thursday nights in the US.. I don’t know if it still is right now) in which one of the main characters got the nickname “Q-Tip”.. guess what they’re doing in Germany? He’s still called “Q-Tip” in the dubbed version even though all those viewers who have never been to the US will not get the joke… that’s ridiculous! A similar thing happened with the movie “The talented Mr Ripley”.. on one occasion, the main character, Tom, is called “peeping Tom” which is a wonderful word play in English.. but of course, in Germany, hardly anybody knows what a peeping Tom is.. do you think they translated it in the dubbed version? NO, of course, they didn’t! And it still gets better: when it comes to movies with a lot of singing – recent movies, I have to add – then the German script writers simply screw everything.. it didn’t use to be that way.. take “My Fair Lady” for example.. this movie got a complete German script.. everything was dubbed, conversations and the whole singing. Even though some people complain that you can’t translate British Cockney accent, the German writers still did a very good job. Eliza Doolittle got a Berlin accent, which is not the same as Cockney, but the most important thing is, everybody understood what she was saying / singing, and the message of the movie was not altered or made unrecognizable!  Now, take “Moulin Rouge”, a recent movie. I happened to watch the German version on TV last night and I got so pissed.. first of all, only talking is dubbed.. the songs are still in English. Don’t get me wrong, that’s fine with me.. I like the voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman and it’s perfectly reasonable that no German actor / actress attempts to do better.. plus, I do understand what they’re singing, but the thing is, most other Germans don’t. So, what would be the easiest solution to this problem? Right, use subtitles for the songs! And what doesn’t happen on German TV? Right: there are NO subtitles! Now, this wouldn’t be a big deal with movies such as, uhm say, “Grease” or “Saturday Night Fever” or whatever.. but in “Moulin Rouge”, the songs are part of the plot.. they add extra information and you can’t just leave them out.. the ordinary German viewer wouldn’t probably even notice that the songs are important, but of course, the script writers screw that as well.. as soon as there’s a spoken word or something that comes close to being spoken, it gets dubbed.. so, there’s this duet of McGregor and Kidman in which he wants her to love him but she is afraid the relationship wouldn’t work out.. so at some point, McGregor goes like “Come love me” and Kidman sings “You will be mean” and McGregor answers “No I won’t”. But since he doesn’t sing this last line, it gets dubbed (“Nein, werde ich nicht” in German).. now, imagine you’re watching a movie in a language you don’t understand and suddenly one of the characters says “No I won’t” in your language. You’ll wonder, what the hell it is that he won’t do??? And unless you have a native speaker next to you, you’ll never find out.. isn’t that ridiculous??????  So, as you might have read between the lines, there’s a tendency in Germany that everything has to be in English.. especially in business, people seem to think that German things stink and English things are cool.. now again, don’t get me wrong.. I do like English things, and I’m far from being a German nationalist.. the thing is, how can I value distinctive English products if some German dorks screw everything? How can I love the English language, if there’s incorrect English wherever you go in Germany? I mean, if I had the money, I’d emigrate immediately, and then, those German idiots could do what they want, I wouldn’t care.. but unfortunately, this is not an option right now.. so, here I am, stuck in a country that’s slowly losing its identity (or at least the chance to create a distinctive German post-WWII-identity). Again, some examples will better illustrate what I’m talking about.. let’s start with some simple things: those of you who are native English speakers, do you know what a “Handy” is? Or a “Barkeeper”? Or a “Dressman”? Or a “Hometrainer”? Well, these are all “German” expressions for things that have a different name in real English. A “Handy” is a cellphone, a “Barkeeper” is simply a bartender, a “Dressman” is a male model, and a “Hometrainer” is any kind of fitness machine you can buy for yourself. You see where this is going to? A few German executives in various fields of business tend to think that English is cool and that people only buy products if they have an English name, no matter whether it’s a real word or not. (there must be some psychological explanation behind this which has to do with Germans being afraid of themselves because of their past, and so on, but I don’t wanna bore you with that)  The examples above are simple.. they might amuse native English speakers but you can easily ignore them.. now, it gets more interesting. Not only do Germans create their own “English” words, they also mix English and German whenever they find a chance to do so. In case you don’t happen to know it, German has more articles than English, and one of them is “die” (pronounced like “deeh”), which is the same as “the” but only used for feminine nouns. So, some German wannabes think they have to announce special offers in their stores with an English slogan because this is oh so creative (nowadays, German slogans can actually be considered creative because there are hardly any in Germany), but since they are Germans, they can’t do it right.. they expect their customers to know the words “happy” and “weeks” but they don’t expect them to know the simple word “the”.. and the result on their sign is, you got it: “Die Happy Weeks”! Applause, applause, applause!  OK, and there’s even something worse than that: how would you call a bag in which you can carry books or folders or school stuff in general or whatever personal belongings you have? Well, how about a book bag? Or maybe a shoulder bag if you can carry it around your shoulder? Or maybe just a “bag”? Sounds okay, doesn’t it? Now, you’d never guess how Germans call it! They use the word (and I don’t mean a German translation for it, no no.. the English word) “bodybag”!!! Hello??? How stupid do you have to be to get a job in the marketing industry? Do only those people qualify who can’t tell an apple from a banana? Is there a special test, in which all intelligent applicants are removed from the waiting line? Do you only qualify if your head is filled with peanuts instead of a brain?  I mean, how hard is it to look in a dictionary and to realize, “oops, the word ‘bodybag’ has some negative connotations, maybe I should find another name for my product”???  So, there you go.. now you know all about Germany you need to know.. if you should be planning a visit to Germany because you want to get to know some typical German things, you’re a few years too late.. sorry folks.. nowadays, you’ll only find “backshops” (pseudo-German for “bakery”) and stupid things like that.. well, the good thing is, after you enjoyed our “Die Happy Weeks”, you can immediately buy your own customized “bodybag”…   Willkommen in Deutschland.. oh sorry, of course, I meant, Welcome to Germany!
