Spencer and I were laughing about all the times that I have made fun of so many people. Man, I was a bitch. Al and I were just on the phone discussing him. He really deserves what he gets. It's not like I should be the one to show him how it is though.   Jason is the same as the rest. Fuck guys. I hate them right now.
