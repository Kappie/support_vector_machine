It's an address/birthday book. It has this character on it, i dunno, its like this mouse in a tutu. I remember it from when i was little. I looked through it and it had all my childhood friend's phone numbers and all of jack's friend's numbers. Jack had scribbled a lot in it, writting my name over and over through out it, because i had turned 1yr when we got the book. The book was divided into seasons and during winter he wrote "januaray is julia's birthday. it's cool" lol and he wrote the same friends phone numbers all through out this little book. We kept this book for years and years, so as i got older i too began to write in it. It went from Jack writting me name to me writting my name. This book has about 7 years worth of birthdays and phone numbers in it. As i flipped through it tears started running down my cheeks. I stopped and thought "why am i crying?" is it because i miss those days when my family was a whole or is it because my dad held on to it? Maybe it's a little of both. It just may be a little birthday/address/phone number book, but it shows my childhook all at the same time. To my 1st birthday to me writting my name and jack's side by side. So many memories are tied into that book. Even my babysitter, whom i still have vivid memories of, the first black lady i ever knew. lol i even asked her once while her son had a white Buddy Doll when he was black. She told me they didn't make black Buddy Dolls.   I'm going guitar searching again today. I really wanna get that one online, even though it will take like a week to get here. dammit!! i want it now! Maybe i'll find on in town though and get the same kind deal..i hope so.   I tried calling lauren yesterday at montreat, even her cabin, but no one answered. lol i thought she would have liked the surprise but i left her a message on her cell phone. miss ya babes!!  *much love and grape soda*
