Night Schyamalan's THE VILLAGE! ...it was alright. i have yet to decide whether or not i like it. or maybe whether i thought it was good...cuz i think i liked it..but i don't know if it was good. does that make sense? no...o well. so tomorrow is my last day here...i'm ready to go home. i don't get to see keevy :( but it's ok, i guess. we're gonna clean out the beretta, i guess i'm gonna do laundry...and we're gonna go visit some family...and then we leave bright and early sunday morn! well i guess that's about it..i have a really bad cramp in my leg and i don't know why....:( i hope it goes away.
