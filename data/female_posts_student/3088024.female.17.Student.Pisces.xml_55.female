Actually, I had a list of questions to ask me interviewer when we were talking.  I did not ask them.  It was a one sided story.  He asked me no questions.  I told him no lies.  He was scary.  He made references to "The Family", alot of violence, and for some reason he also used the term "blood" to describe things of the color red.  He said and I quote "The customers and the employees are my family when they are inside this store.  If you don't take care of a customer, I will take of you.  You see this picture.  These my two little girls.  This store puts food on their table.  You treat the customers bad, they don't come back.  They don't come back, these doors close.  These doors close, no food for my little girls.  No food for my little girls, I come after you."  I am dead serious.  Then he went on about how I need to get an education.  How I shouldn't have to live this life forever.  Then some more violent quotes and a little bit of language.  It was fun.  I don't think an interviewer has ever sworn before.  The office was dimly lit and added to the effects.  All in all it was just something else to tell my kids.
