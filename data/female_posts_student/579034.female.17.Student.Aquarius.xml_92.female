I'm like totally in everything is fallin apart mode at the moment. The one thing I thought was stable is just totally like... (racks brain for big SAT word.... can't find one) messed up. Well, I'm not really sure if it's messed up but it sure looks that way. I'm totally dreading midterms, and second honors is like a world away, and so is something (one) else. Eh... I guess I'll have to deal... I think things are going bad cause I missed the Legion of Mary meeting yesterday to go to Millrose. Which we didn't even make it to. But... yeah... I have a big religion test I didn't even study for. Whop-de-friggin-do. x0x
