But the idea of getting up and going to band at 9:00 every morning doesnt make me happy.  And i still want Mr. Barr back.  I still havent started on my homework for mrs. un-fun-roe, even though its due in 3 weeks.  Other than that, nothing has happened today...band now rules my life once again.  Now there's nothing left to say. Bye bye homies...lol  *Caitlin*
