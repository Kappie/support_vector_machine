Everyone who knows me, especially within the past 5 years, knows that I LIVE for football season!  I LOVE football!  Every year I sit, from January to September, in waiting for football season.  I even like the pre-season, which for a football fan, is a stretch.  Pre-season is the time when they play most of their 2nd stringers so that their starters don’t get hurt, pre-season doesn’t start until September…**sigh**  Matt and I awoke this morning with a great deal of anticipation for the 11am hour.  Draft day on ESPN covers the NFL Draft Live!  It’s so exciting, college football/NFL hopefuls getting jobs on national TV, showing their pride for their new teams from the first moments!  It just makes me all warm inside!  I LOVE FOOTBALL!  Though we were excited about the NFL Draft, something rather stranger befell the draft this day.  Eli Manning, son of Archie Manning, brother to Peyton Manning –one of my favorite quarterbacks- released a statement that he would not play for the San Diego Chargers.  This is unprecedented.  The SD Chargers had the first draft pick, as they had the worse season in ’03.  So we sat by, waiting with some amount of anticipation, to see if SD would draft him and let him sit on their bench without pay for the season.  They ended up drafting him and trading him to the NY Giants for Philip Rivers.  It was a good move all around.   Still, a good more or not, it was something that makes you wonder, what the hell was Eli thinking?  Eli Manning, a Senior at Ol’ Miss now player for the NY Giants was already 2 steps behind and refusing to play for the Chargers made set him back another step.  So he goes into his professional football career 3 steps back, I hope he can live up to the hype.  Yeah, he has the Manning name, but will it be enough?  I sure hope so; I really like this guy!  So now Matt and I await football season with much anticipation.  We can’t wait; it should be a good year!  ~Kristyn
