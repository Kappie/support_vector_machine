SO FAR I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT ME WHICH I THINK UVE HAD ENOUGH NOW ITS TIME TO TALK ABOUT THAT SPECIAL PERSON WHO IS IN MY LIFE. WE GOT TOGETHER ON OCTOBER THE 15 OF 2004. THE TIME THAT I HAVE SPENT WITH HIM AND THE DAYS SLIP BY SO FASY AND WISH THEY WOULD GO SLOWER. HE MEANS MORE TO ME THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.   HE HAS BROUGHT SO MUCH TO ME AND HAS MADE ME REALIZED THAT WHEN U HAVE THAT SOMEBODY YOU PUT EVERYTHING AND ANYTHIN ASIDE AND JUST WORRY ABOUT THE ONE YOUR WITH. HES TAUGHT ME THAT NOT ALL GUYS ARE THE SAME, THAT THERE IS THAT SPECIAL ONE FOR EVERYBODY AND I DONT KNOW IF HES THE ONE BUT HE IS A SPECIAL ONE TO ME.   I THANK GOD FOR BRINGING HIM AND LETTING HIM CROSS MY PATH BECAUSE HE IS HELPING ME ALOT EVEN THOUGH YEAH WE HAVE OUR DISAGREEMENTS AND ARGUE ABOUT THE SMALLEST THINGS, IN THE END HE'S ALWAYS THERE FOR ME AND THATS WHY I GOT ALOT OF AFFECTION FOR HIM AND WHY I LIKE HIM SO MUCH, AND I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR HIM AND NO ONE ELSE...
