So, we're performing our show and this group of students from Bell is screaming and cussing and throwing ice and tennis balls and paper and such on to the field. I found it very disrespectful..but funny at the same time. Because some of them got arrested. Hehe...So now, we get home around 10:30 or so, and I went home n SLEPT until 3:30, so i could get up, get a shower n be at school by 5. I left the house with my hair soaking wet, no make-up...but ya know what? I enjoyed not caring. So in San Antonio we got a division one rating, but didnt make finals. The bands that made finals...made me laugh. Because they don't have marching shows! They have some guy rapping n people breakdancing and dirty sluts for color guard. Or they have people jumping on trampolines and such. Or they have someone playing a guitar and people worshipping guard members. Come on. And of course Bell had the same show they've had for the past 6 years...the machine twice...what a shock. So I slept the entire way back, and we got home around 4 or 4:30. I'm not sure what time because I was too tired to care. Then I got home and slept until about 12. Or close enough.  Anyways, I dunno what it was about the trip, but I felt incredibly...lonely. And I don't necessarily mean the relationship kind of way...I just mean lonely. Through alot of Saturday I found myself just kinda sitting alone, walking around alone, not really talking to anyone...just sort of alone. And I didn't really go running for anyone either, because I just didn't care. I just got this feeling like I wasn't really welcome to hang out with anyone. It made me question alot of things. Like where I stand as far as friendships with people are concerned. Because if people are gonna give me a cold shoulder whenever they don't feel I'm "needed", then do I really want to be hanging around with them? It might have just been an odd weekend, but it made me sorta feel like shit. I think I just need to re-evaluate things.  Ah well, I'm gonna go now...I feel like going shopping today. Shopping can make me happy. And I'm not broke either. :)
