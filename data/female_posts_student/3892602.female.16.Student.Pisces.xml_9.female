I listen compulsively to the radio for three days to try and find out when the Nickelback concert is, only to find out that it's freaking TONIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!! What the hooplah? Just my stinking luck.    And to think now...I could be in the same vicinity as two of my favorite bands...think I'll go cry now (or at least fidget some way to see Spidey2 again}=] )  Fun things lie  urlLink here .   urlLink And here. I love this picture.
