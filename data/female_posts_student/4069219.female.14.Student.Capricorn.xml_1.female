Sighx, from conception to grave, my class is getting from bad to worse....... but the good thing is , our school have more than 55% non english background students (exchange students, international students and some ppl who just came here nt long ago like mi) so,, discrimination and racism is gradually dissappearing , duhx, who dares to offend those asian gangs... but still. discrimination sometimes exist.. but nt as obvious as other school lorx. Overall, my conclusion is :Carlingford high-really gives me a shit
