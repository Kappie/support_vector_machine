Tory is big beutiful witch and was also very loving in her own way. if you stand next to her she'll almost knock you over by scratching her head on your back. anyways these are the things i think about most when i think of tory. i really love her adn i'll miss her alot. but she's in pain now so its not like its a pointless death. she had a wonderful life with lackshmi too. i'm going to see her tonight.
