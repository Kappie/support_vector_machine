Well all was well until the end. My mom called me up for something, and we got in a small argument. That just pushed me over the edge i guess. Something inside me just snapped. A small gloom set over me. Then we were watching tv (my bf and I) and my dad gets home, of course my parents start to fight. Anyways. I dunno what happend from there. I just totaly fell apart. I wanted to cry so badly, but i dont know why. My insecurity must be comming back. After i tried so hard to surpress it...it comes back to haunt me. Why? Every time I am able to confront and conqure my sorrow...it comes back ten fold. Now i just feel depressed again. It hurts. I want releif, but my relief is gone for now. So of course eventually i gave in to my boyfriend, and just cried. I sat there and cried until he had to go. It wasn't long, but i still had no reason to cry. So it was pointless. But he said it wasn't, perhaps he's right. I dont know...I dont know anything anymore...why wont this darkness just leave me the hell alone!!!
