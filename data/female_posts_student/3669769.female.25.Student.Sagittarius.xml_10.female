My devotion I've given to this store. The along comes Misses Right, She and the boss are really tight. Day by day I know she prays That no one will see her sneaky ways. I work and slave while she kissed butt I'm having trouble keeping my mouth shut. Before I knew it, she was making more than me Good Lord, can they not see Past her greedy smile and liar's glee? Why is this I pay this huge fee To hold my tongue and keep working hard? Smile, oh, laugh, ha, she is a card! All she does, I do and more Except kiss butt and adore The boss who hands out the cash to her and I. I refuse to stoop to her level, why?   1997-by me I wrote this poem while working at Sonic Drive-In. My best friend and I worked there together our junior and senior year's of high school. We had a lot of great times unless 'Monica' was working. It's been seven years since we left Sonic but sadly, I'll never forget the girl who was hired and kissed ass all the way to the top...
