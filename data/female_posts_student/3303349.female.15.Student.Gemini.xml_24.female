Yeah onward to my "social life"! Tony has called me everyday since wednesday. Yeah we've talked for like 3 and a half hours everytimes. But now my mom is tring to kill me because I am on the phone so much!! Yeah the conversations have gotten really deep. But I like it and it's something to do to kill three and a half hours other then study for drivers ed! I am just killing time till he is supposed to call me again...about 15 minutes but I have gotten in some good practice while killing time! My lessons are on Monday so I happy to have more organization to my practicing again. About a year ago I wouldn't even think about practing as much as i do now and it makes me happy because I have gotten insanely better and since I am not in Symphonic band next year it will help me acheve my goal of first chair in Rustler band!! Which I know I could do...oh so easily...oh fun...I knew all this practing would get me somewhere! Yeah well I should go knock a few more pages off of my summer reading book for honors next year and find a heating pad to help ease my back which hurts like heck! Good bye!
