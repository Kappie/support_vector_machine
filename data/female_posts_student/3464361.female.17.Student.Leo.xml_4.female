This Sunday..Hannah's lovely dance performance, can't wait it's gonna be long...and AWESOME! Got two interviews at McDick's...yes I am in desperate need of a summer job, lol I think it might be sorta fun though!  This weekend...not much is happening since we have exams next week. YAY, I only have one! :p Wait till next weekend rolls around though, there will be plenty to do I'm sure :) Hopefully the weather gets really hot soon cause I'm not too impressed with all this wind and clouds! :( Emily...Comes home in like 16 days! Ahh, this is going to be a very exciting day, we haven't seen her for a good 5 months and ahh it's weird what happens when one member of a tight knit group of friends leaves... Whistler is coming up soon too..can't wait, once again better be good weather or else I will have my words! Hahaha! Well, not much is going on tonight, just hanging out with Brad when he gets off work! I'm not telling him, but we're watching NEVER BEEN KISSED. Muahaha!  Love all, Lia xo
