I met up with Anthony at Rite Aid and he convinced a woman to buy two bottles of Charddonay for him.  LOL.  It cost $20 and he only ahd $16... she didn't even care.  Damn friendly lady.  Bet she could get even friendlier with some wine... mmmm  I ended up getting the lab a thankyou card that says "Thanks from the bottom of my heart"... I'm going to cross out heart and put "lung" (we work on rat lungs).  Yeah.  Nice and corny.  And I got cards for a bunch of other people too and used up all the cash on me.  Now I'm poor for the rest of the week.  Shit.  Quarters and pennies from here on out.  Anyway... I'm coming back Saturday afternoon... do you guys want to see the new American Pie movie Saturday night?
