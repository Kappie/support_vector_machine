I don't understand why her parents are getting on her case when mine don't even seem to care so much anymore except for the occasional annoying interrogation session. Sure, she's way busy--busier than I am, I venture--and as a result the grades aren't going to hold up as well, but that's the way it goes. What do they want out of her? But it's the bf issue too. I think my parents would undergo a stage of suspicion if they ever discovered that I had one. Just talking to people like T and A make me appreciate that I can sleep in, that I can just sit there and wrap presents as I damn well please, that I can at least go to Santa Monica on Tuesday. But that's not going to help T, is it?  Reading R's profile. Sometimes it makes me kind of itch to see what they're writing about. And part of me doesn't care, as usual.  Aah, it's probably been more than an hour. And it's time for more listening to loud, loud music. Or wrapping presents.
