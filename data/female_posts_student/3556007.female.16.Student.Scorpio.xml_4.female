Well, first I went to the mall that Friday with Hunter. We went to see Matrix 3, but since we aren't 17 we bought tickets to Scary Movie 3. Then we went and walked around. We talked a lot, and he wanted to take me to dinner at the Rainforest Cafe, but I told him no. For one, it would be way too expensive, and also, I hate when people spent money on me (especially when they have a girlfriend). So we went to the food court. I ate a hamburger and he ate nothing. We talked a ton. He talked about life in Egypt, and I talked about everything. Then we went to the movies. We went to see Texas Chainsaw Massacre instead, but got kicked out after about 5 minutes. So, we went to FYE instead. We played table hockey, and I got beat miserably. Then we wandered FYE's music section or whatever it is called. We talked about a lot of music and listened to some. Then we went to Jillians. Hunter wanted to go dancing, and so did I but I was still uneasy about this whole having a girlfriend thing. But we went anyways, and the Groove Shack was closed for some wedding. So we stood there for about ten minutes talking. I could tell that he wanted to kiss me, but I wasn't going to let him. We went outside and sat out there, and I wore his sweatshirt because it was cold outside. Then we went back inside and sat on those massage chairs. We talked until about 10:30 pm when my dad came and picked us up. When I got home, my jacket smelled like him, and I never wanted to take it off.   Well, it turns out that Hunter ended up being sick on Monday and Tuesday, so his girlfriend was obviously really pissed off. On Wednesday morning before 1st period, she dumped him. He could tell that it had been coming for a while now, but he was still really sad. He said on the phone that he thought that he loved her.   Well, on Thursday he came over to my house. We were going to do precal, and then watch Identity. We did some precal, but then didn't end up watching Identity because he was all over me. Squeezing my leg and putting his face right up in mine. Then, he asked me, "Do you want to?" And I responded by saying, "Yes, but it just doesn't feel right." He felt really bad about it, and called later to apologize profusely. I told him not to worry about it. On Friday, after school I told him to meet me at my locker. I was determined to make the first move and kiss him on Friday, but instead I just handed him the note that I had promised. Before I left, I gave him a hug which I could tell that he totally did not expect and walked off.  I had to leave for the weekend which sucked, but in a sense, the timing couldn't be better. On Friday on the way up, I textmessaged him. He went to see Scary Movie 3 all by himself, and then just went home. He said that he was really depressed, and I felt awful that I couldn't be there for him. On Saturday in the afternoon I called him because I had freetime at the church retreat that I was mentoring at. Mike (Hunter's best friend) was over at his house, but was in the shower. One of the first things that Hunter said (acutally I think this was in a text message...) was that he and Amanda were getting back together because they were both miserable. Oh, this was Friday night! I remember. Well, I was like ummm ok. And he asked if it was a bad thing. I said that we both knew what I wanted to say, but I wasn't going to say it. I also said that I didn't understand why he thought he loved a girl who doesn't have time for him, doesn't talk to him on the phone, doesn't pay that much attention to him, and has mean friends. I told him that he was taking the easy way out. He kept asking me what I thought about it, and I wasn't going to admit it to him, but I was completely heartbroken.   We talked again on Saturday when Mike was over at his house, and we text messaged all during the dance and through the night. I told him that Amanda had him whipped, and each time that I talked to him it seemed less and less like they were going to get back together on Monday. Then I called him at midnight again, and we talked. He wanted to know when I was coming back, and he wanted me to come over to his house. He said that he needed help with precal, but as soon as I went over there he was like "I don't feel like studying." We went upstairs to his living room, and I noticed that he had new furniture. I sat down on his couch and began to eat my gummy bears while watching the football game. He got closer and closer to me until finally, I don't know how it happened, but we just kissed. My mouth was full of gummy bears which was probably a good thing because my breath would have been nasty. And it wasn't just a little kiss, it was a full out French kiss, and I have never even been kissed before (besides truth or dare, but that doesn't really count)! It came so naturally though... I asked him if he wanted a gummy bear, and he ate it. Then I asked him if he wanted another one. He took it from me, and held it in his lips. Then he told me to take it from him, so I did. Well, one thing lead to another, and we were making out all over the couch. Then he led me into his room, and we were making out all over the bed. He was on top of me, and it felt so nice to just lay there with him kissing me. Then he made me put on this skirt that I promised that I would put on. He had his hands all over my butt and told me that I had a nice ass. I didn't want to wear the skirt, so I refused to kiss him until I could put on my pants again. So instead he kissed all up and down my neck. It was like nothing I have ever felt before. Then after I put back on my pants, we went back onto his bed and I was on top of him. I kept falling asleep though because of lack of sleep from the weekend. I was so tired. Then he rolled me off the bed and onto the floor. He wrapped his legs around me, and said that he wanted to stay here forever. I told him that forever was a long time. Then he said that he loved me and that he had been feeling this way for a long time. I told him that I thought that I loved him, but I wasn't sure. And that I didn't want to tell him that I loved him until I was sure. I just don't know though... Because he said that he thought that he loved Amanda. He tells me how beautiful I am, and how great I am at kissing even though that was the first time that I had ever frenched someone.  But then, tonight, he really confused me. He told me that he cared about me, but then he also said that he liked being single and didn't want a relationship just yet... I don't understand boys. So, since he has been saying so much how girls are so confusing, I textmessaged him saying how confusing guys are.   That is pretty much all for today. I don't know. This is kind of eating my life. It is taking over. I can't think about anyone but Hunter, and I haven't done my homework in about a week. Ellen is right; I am smitten...  Oh, and I am going to try to write in here more frequently. ;)
