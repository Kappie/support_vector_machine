SO tonight is gonna be a catching up time and idk what we'll do after that. I feel like camping or something, and not the Camper camping bc thats gay, u might as well stay home, im talking about out in the wilderness camping, where u could be tore to shredds by a wild bear or something lol altho i dont like bugs so well see how good that goes. Oh heres a lil recap of what happened to andrea and that whole shindig, Remember how she said i didnt have n e friends and that my friend mel and brianna and everyone was talking shit behind my back ? well i told them and they were like wtf, we dont even talk to andrea, so they got EVERYONE to call her and harrass her, lifes great. ok i gotta go, ttyl i will write later
