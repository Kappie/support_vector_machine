( we are in ghetto town by the way ) i was like alright idiot i'm sure. but he finally quit being a whiny bitch and got in the car.  while he is at physical therapy i went to old navy and got a back pack that my mom had to go and get after work so i put it on hold! it's adorable. i like it. then i went back to pick judson up at the place.  around 3:30 i went to nathans and we hung out.. which was a great time. i had so much fun and i'm glad we hung out before he moved. i think i laughed today more than all the days this week combined. yay nate is the coolest. we went to mcdonalds and he got the meal but he didn't eat his fries... weird. and then we went and visited my mom at the cookie bouquet ( picture this.. nathan is in his pj pants the whole time.. haha he had woken up only a little before i went over ) and she bribed me into going make a delivery so we went and did that. and then i got to bring nathan to pick up his car ( yeah her name is christi. ) and he was very excited and then we went back to his house and watched tv being lazy.  i came home took a shower and got ready to go to dags. so i met up with nate and we went to dags...  dags was awesome. both bands were just great. and i was excited i went. the curb was dylan scott jake and jeff ( i think? it's scott's cousin ) and they were really good.. it was my first time ever seeing them. and a lot of people showed up and i was just chattin with everyone having a good time.. and laughed at drunk people dancing. and leda swan played and they were just awesome... it's henry michael chris and some guy i don't know his name.. i've seen them play before and they are just wow. they are very good and i thought they did a great job. i talked to matthew romero and i'm very upset that he is leaving me tomorrow and i must bid him a farewell. dylan actually opened a bottle with my key.. ( he was desperate.. i'm guessing? ) and then he broke my key chain... ( come on my fav. one the martini glass ) but he fixed it. haha good times at dags. i was glad to see everyone.  tomorrow i'm going shopping in baton rouge.. woop woop! me and mom are going on a road trip and we are going to bond and it will be just great. oh yeah and andrew is coming meet up with me.. what a great guy. he's my very good friend from baton rouge that i met july 4th. can't wait can't wait.  mrs. renee is staying the night with my mom tonight.. they are having a slumber party ( how cute right ? ) they are telling the most hilarious stories.. i think my mom misses her best friend. why does she have to live in houston :-( i miss her too. haha but she is moving her son, brett into his apartment in BR and she is staying here for the night. woohoo.. catching up time.  yeah. laterrr dudes.
