Other than that, i dont know what im gonna do this week. school starts at a later time on wednesday but thats no big deal. tuesday, my little brother has his little league baseball game, friday her has a practice. i might take marissa to a movie in the next few weeks or so. im thinking about it. im not in the best shape health wise but im getting better. see ya all l8r.
