'What games does he like best?' 'Does he collect butterflies?'. They ask: 'How old is he?' 'How many brothers does he have?' 'How much does he weigh?' 'How much money does his father make?' Only then do they think they know him." - Antoine de Saint-Exupery,  The Little Prince   "I like to pick up hitchhikers. When they get in the car I say, 'Put on your seat belt. I want to try something. I saw it once in a cartoon, but I think I can do it.'" - Steven Wright  "I've been a fool to allow dreams to become great expectations." - Tim Rice,  Chess   "Where are you, my friend? I lost even your shadow." -  Tverskoy Boulevard   "You know how it is when you're reading a book and falling asleep, you're reading, reading...and all of a sudden you notice your eyes are closed? I'm like that all the time." -- Steven Wright  "My roommate got a pet elephant. Then it got lost. It's in the apartment somewhere." -- Steven Wright
