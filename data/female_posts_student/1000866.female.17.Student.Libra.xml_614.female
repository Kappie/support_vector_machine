Like, it had the potential to be fun but it definitely sucked...until I got to Kathryn's house which was actually sort of...bad in certain ways too. It started at lunch when I met Joanne in the band room and Carson came in at the same time and...oh, it was unfortunate. Carson was really upset about it and when I went to go see if she was ok I told her I was sorry and that I really didn't know they'd meet there. I didn't know Carson would be going to the band room too. And she's like, "I could have used a warning," in this really sarcastically mean voice. It just really bothered me because it wasn't my fault at all. I'm not giving up either of them as friends because they don't get along very well anymore. Grrrrr.  TThen, I got my paycheck. YaY! That did make me happy although it was reduced from $118 to about $99 because of the stupid union and federal taxes and whatnot. Boo  union. Oh well. That's still a nice chunk of change. 18 hours of work. Then, I went to jazz cafe and I was having a lot of fun, I really was but there weren't a lot of people dancing really so, a couple of us were trying to get people to dance more and apparently it offended JSO and Rob Parton or something. I mean, only one person said that to me but he said parents thought so too. I honestly wasn't trying to disrespect anyone. I was trying to be appreciative of the great music and dance. Miscommunication sucks. But then other people seemed not mad at all after I talked with them last night so...I don't know. I just hope Rob wasn't offended. He seemed like a really cool guy and he was really good. :)  Anyway...then I went to Kathryn's for the sleepover and...the saga continues after I go out to eat with my family. More later.
