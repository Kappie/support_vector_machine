Michelle was patting the puppies(Tia Maria and Maxwell) and Tia scratched Jillian across her boobs by accident and it really hurt. Then we went to Michelle's house and watched Anger Manegment. It was a horrible movie!!!!! We went and got Rachel to go and see into her new houses backyard. Now we are sitting at Michelle's house and listening to music. Michelle is going to Holland and to camp so we will not see each other for like the rest of the summer (jillian is very amd). Tonight we went for a bike ride, ate cookies, and played a basketball video game. Jillian is going home very soon and is going to call Michelle in the morning after she finishes babysitting at 1:00.   bye
