I also was having fun messing around on the drums because i had never herd the song befor so I had no idea what i was doing. however everyone else had no idea. I like vitamin C. I like blogging it's fun. I love not caring about proper english rules. can you believe this. Just me myself and God.  I also like words to a song. if you read my writing you will see I use phrases alot. I still remeber when 30 was old. when he had to go. I think my typing is improving. just to let you know i write and then delete and write something else till i get bourd with it and then i post it. can hotdogs really call on the phone or do they grow on vines like strawberry wine? I got off track. very sorry. so any way I was in church playing on the drums and it was fun. this love has taken its toll on me . oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oooh. That was harlyous ha ha! he he he! can you have more fun in a room with nothing but yourself a bed and a computer becouse I can. if i can just see you tonight.I love writing what ever come to mind. tonight. I am done                                         with hope
