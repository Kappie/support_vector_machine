No more stupid tests or Mr. O'Hara's babling...this is just great...now I'm gonna have a summer! I'm happy. The final test turned out to be not that hard because he let us use our books and I'm sure he'll be lenient on the final driving test...I get my lisence when I get back from seely! yay. Other then that I have nothing interesting to say so I'm just gonna stair at the computer screen and wait for Paul to start talking to me...
