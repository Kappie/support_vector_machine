Daily Horoscope:  In the midst of difficult times, today can be uplifting as long as you don't buy into your own illusions or the illusions of others. You are wrestling these days with significant circumstances and you may feel the need to make important decisions. Keep your mind on the big picture. Pay attention to what's happening so you don't get confused about which thoughts are your own and which are coming from others.    I am  so  trying to keep my eye on the prize.  It excites me that I will be back in school in less than 2 months, and, I'll admit, it frightens me. A lot. I mean, I haven't had to write a paper (except for Lisa's, which were not all that taxing) in years. I'm scared I'll go back and realize that whatever analytical skills I had have evaporated into thin air.  When I start getting apprehensive, I start trying to convince myself that my life is not as empty as I thought it was. My self-confidence is undermined by my fear of failing a second time. I have to work to keep these thoughts out of my head and stick with the path I've started down.  Kind of like my whole dieting thing. But I started back on Atkins today. I'm determined to stick with it. I'm not worried about heart disease; as that damn doctor said in May, my heart's as "strong as an ox," even considering the fact that I'm overweight. It's just a matter of willpower for me.  So here's hoping- on both counts.
