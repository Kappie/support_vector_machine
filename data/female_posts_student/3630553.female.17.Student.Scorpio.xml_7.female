Just around 7:00 in the evening, he was walking on his way to his Mercedez Benz, which was parked somewhere near the edge of the road. Wearing an $800 worth of business suite and some good-looking pair of shoes, he opened the left door of his luxury car and popped in. But as he was about to close the it, a huge truck suddenly came zooming from behind, smashing his door on the side and detaching it completely from the handsome Benz.  Oozing with anger, the man jumped out from his damaged car and signaled the truck driver to pull over.  In less than a minute, the driver was negotiating with the businessman, who was constantly yelling like an angry bull.  “Bastardo! You must be the most stupid man in the face of this freaking planet not to notice my car parked in here,” he yelled. “I’m gonna call the police and sue you for this damage!”   “Sir, but…” the driver exclaimed.  “Don’t ‘but’ me, you asshole!” the man interrupted. Don’t you realize how much damage you’ve cost? And could you even calculate? You’re annual salary might not even be enough to pay the half of it!”  “Sir, for a while…” the driver said, trying to squeeze his words on the man’s sermon.  “Don’t even try to defend your position,” the man exclaimed. “It’s your fault, can’t you see? You are the offensive driver here!”  “Sir, pardon. What I’m trying to say is…” the driver insisted.  “What?!?” the man asked, annoyed.  “Sir, I think you better call an ambulance first,” the driver said in concern.  “Ambulance for what?” the man asked, even more annoyed. “The police are on their way to arrest you. You’d regret this.”  “Sir, you were completely occupied by your anger that you probably didn’t notice it,” the driver said. “Your left arm was also lost upon the smash.”  The man, then, looked on his side with an expression of shock.   “Oh, shit! My Rolex!” the man roared.
