Four minutes and you leave after the fight Five minutes and you see a great big light Six minutes and your lying on the ground That's just six minutes of your day Seven minutes and you feel like you could fly Eight minutes and you can see some people cry Nine minutes and you know your gonna' die Thats the last 10 minutes of your life
