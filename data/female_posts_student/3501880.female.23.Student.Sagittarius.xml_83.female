Sure, her hair has gotten lighter over the years, but it takes a stretch of the imagination to call her blonde with a straight face.  And when did Jessica Simpson become one of the top three brainy blondes in Hollywood? Do I really need to comment on what is wrong with that sentence?  On another note, I have become a bit addicted to Days of Our Lives. Well, I have been on and off since for the last ten years. I have noticed that Kyle from the Real World Chicago has joined the cast as Phillip, and I have to say that I am quite impressed with his acting ability. Despite the horrible script, he does a good job delivering the lines in the most believeable way possible.  And can I tell you how much I love the Sammy/Lucas love fest! It is so nice that they completely ignore their son, Will, in order to make googly eyes at each other.
