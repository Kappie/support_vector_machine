Today is raining and miserable but I think we really need it and its going to make the garden look pretty again- silver lining.   I feel so tired yet so awake so the weather is actually pretty appropriate. I went to sleep at about 4:30 this morning. I really need to learn to go out earlier :P but it wasn't my fault.   I'm looking forward to the tigers v parra game even though I will be incredibly out numbered...
