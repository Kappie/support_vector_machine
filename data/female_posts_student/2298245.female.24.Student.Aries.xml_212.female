The bad news is I wish I'd stayed in bed, with the morning I've been having.  I printed stuff out last night, and came to school this morning to find that it had not printed at all.  Then, this morning, I reprint, and nearly everything I sent to print printed incorrectly.  So on the third try I finally had some success.  So I guess I'll just have to thank the Lord for small miracles, and hope that some larger ones find their way my direction soon.  There is a long weekend coming up for me, which is nice.  My goal is to be caught up and ready to take on next week with full force come Tuesday morning, just a week from now.  We shall see how that works out for me.  Guess I should start my dedicated fast working now, if I'm going to get anything done at all today.  No time to waste...I wasted it all already on the Lexis printers in the Journal office on the third floor.
