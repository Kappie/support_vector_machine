I can't say that he's as brilliant as Fitzgerald in terms of prose, but there are highlights: "...from where he sat he could see the ranked shelves close-packed with the solid, squat, dynamic shapes of tin cans whose labels his stomach read, not from the lettering which meant nothing to his mind but from the scarlet devils and the silver curve of fish." And "hermetic meat."  It took me a while to finish "Barn Burning," and at times the person carrying out the action was so mixed up by jumps in plot and vague pronouns that I didn't know what was going on. I think I have a sense, but I can't say I'm sure. It's good, though. But it's that thinking man's novel; I can't sit down as if I were reading contemporary fiction and just skim through it.  At any rate, I'm inspired. Faulkner seems like another author to love just for the prose, and even more: the regionalism was a major element of "Barn Burning" but it wasn't pervasive or so central to the plot that it inhibited understanding, so I'll be ok. Before, I was afraid that this heavily southern setting would make for an experience like, say, a caucasian reading Joy Luck or me reading Arranged Marriage.   Of course, I'm just typing away like nuts because I'm not going online today. Oh, it hurts to finally say that, and definitively. My eyes are already dry, but they were itchy before; it's probably from allergies. Listening to Mom's Josh Groban CD--I'm surprised she has it--and enjoying the fact that half of it is in Italian, so I won't have to listen in for the words.  I have anatomy car wash tickets! It's going to be May 2 from 10am to 2:30pm in the parking lot, $5 each car. Help me get rid of them. Hah.
