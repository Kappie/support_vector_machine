Talking about cumulative fatigue. - Bleah- For someone who freaks out at the slightest increase in circumference of her vital stats, it's such a contradiction when all the labour she does is digest the food and collapse into slumberland minutes after the last feeding time. Hiakz.. I swear my clothes really felt much tighter now. Oh well... I hope it's Pms.. NO, it MUST be pms. haha. =] Ironically as it started out to be when I 1st decide on this blog, I recalled that I was so anti- men then.. haha...well genetic programming always superceedes in the end yea? I'm still pretty cautious inside, maybe it's just too much hurt before.. I missed my baby... -winks- Hope he's doing fine over in Indonesia. I've ceased to be in wonder on how life turns out to be for it takes a course on it's own. Well, well, my fatigue is starting to act up again..time to sleep now.. ahha. Laterz!   Muacks my baby. =]
