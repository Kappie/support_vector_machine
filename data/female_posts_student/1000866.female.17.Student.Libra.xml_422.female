I need to get some stuff for homecoming that I wont have another chance to get.   I'm really really excited for homecoming. :) I seriously think it's going to be so much fun.   I just talked to Joanne on the phone for about 40 minutes! :) It was so nice to actually talk to her again. I really miss her a lot. Ah well. I guess I should get going. Lots to do.
