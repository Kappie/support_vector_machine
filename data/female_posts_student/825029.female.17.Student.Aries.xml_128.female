I'll have to make up my Spanish test and I won't be able to review during Chemistry, but it's ok.  I still have to memorize my solo, so any extra practice time I can squeeze in before I have to go to band is very welcome.  I'm so excited!  The last episode of Joe Millionaire is TONIGHT!  At 8!  No, I'm not being sarcastic - I hate reality shows, but I can't seem to stop watching Joe Millionaire, and I can't wait to see who he picks and how she reacts to the fact that he's not a millionaire!  And I also started watching The Bachelorette, too.  I like The Bachelor better, though.  Oddly enough, the very first guy on The Bachelor is the son of my dad's very good friend.  It was pretty amusing to see the guy that used to eat all the gross vegetables off my plate having sex with several women and trying to find one who he could marry.  The show made it out to be some huge ordeal and that she was going to move to California with him and blahblahblah... it didn't end up anything like that.  They're not married, they're not going to get married, she didn't move to California, and the only reason he took any part in the show was to get his name out in the open in order to boost his business.  hehehehe yep, gotta love those "reality" shows.  Well, I'm gonna go do all the homework I had this weekend that I never did.  And maybe a shower will help me feel better... adios!
