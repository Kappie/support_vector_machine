One of them, I've really been looking forward to. I've wanted to read it for so long but haven't gotten the chance...no, not chance...really, it was just a contingency, but yes...Les Mis! I'm really looking forward to reading it. I've only heard good things.   I also bought some books that are a bit less than par adjacent to what I normally read, but they still look very good. The first one is called,  The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants , and the second is,  The Second Summer of the Sisterhood . Wow, this won't let me underline. Oh well.   Oh! I also bought the new Janet Evanavich book. YaY! I love her books. They're so great. Not really great literature, but great books nonetheless. I hope she found a new editor though. Her last book had so many misprints. Even I noticed a few, and I...obviously am not omniscient on the matter.  I think I may go read the rest of Gatsby. I've already heard pretty much everything that happens. This is why I like to read books on my own. No one tells me what happens no matter how much I want to know. I loved this passage in the book today though...I think it's my favorite in the book so far and, probably will remain my choice passage...  "He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.  Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago.  For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound and what I had almost remebered was uncommunicable forever."  Ah, I know I'm weird, but I still loved it!  I guess I'll go read more and at least find out HOW Gatsby dies.
