As I stood there waiting for my coffee he came over to chat. I was like WTF. I cant chat dude leave me alone!!! I'm not good at talking to stranger. Especially ones who approach me first. The conversation begins, "Hi my name is Perry, I couldnt help myself staring at you, so I decided to come over to talk while we wait for our coffee". I reply, "Hello! I'm still not awake yet! Do you work around here?" Perry - "Yep, I work for a computer company around the corner. You didnt tell me your name?" Me - "Oh, sorry i'm Sakdary, its nice to meet you on an early morning". Damn, what should I say to him? I'm gonna blow him off like all them other guys I know it. Perry - "Its nice to meet you too. So what are you having? Do you come here every morning? Do you work or go to school around here?" Me - " I'm having a caramel macchiotto ( on the top of my head, I told myself that I should have a caramel macchiotto frabbachinno next time). I work around here for a Real Estate title company". Finally my coffee was handed to me. Yea... I get to take off. Me - "Umm, its nice to meet you, i'll see ya around sometime aye!!!" As I started to walk away he follow me to my car. Perry - " Is it okay if I asked you out for lunch sometime since we worked so close to eachother?" Me - "Umm, I'm in a hurry rite now and i'm also seeing somebody. But i'll see you around sometime okay? Have a nice day". Damn, I really sucks when it comes to guys. Sometime I sit and wonder, asking myself why cant I give anyone a chance to open up to me? Maybe its becasue i'm scared to get hurt. Or maybe I cant fine that Mr. Right. Or maybe i'm left all alone in this world with no soulmate!!! Oh well, only god knows. Let the time reveals its secrets to me.
