Well, Ed was my partner for the final project in my Zooarch class with Gil, wherein we did some work on carnivore damage on the Hellenistic assemblage from his site in Turkey.  Anyhoo, a girl who graduated from NU with me (one of the few archaeologists, although she was actually a major and I wasn't) just sent mea message last week and mentioned that Ed was in the city, although I really didn't expect to actually run into him.  Once again, I am reminded of what a small world I am a part of.   I may have mentioned this before, but there are loads and loads (gobs, even) of feral cats that hang around the campus.  In the past two weeks or so, the kittens have started wandering around.  Now, they aren't tiny and are certainly at least a couple months old, but I didn't actually start seeing them until recently.  And there are also cat fights everywhere.  I haven't actually seen one yet, but we hear them in the lab all the time.  Some of the cats are actually cute, and I really want to play with them, but given that they have claws and teeth and could be disease-ridden, I guess that would be a poor idea.  Ah well.
