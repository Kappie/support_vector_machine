She says to me...she says "you know what....lets take dirty Sanchez for a swim in that pond over there..." and before I could remind her that he is on a leash she was already to the pond. Well...kimmy can't swim so she just kinda let the rabbit go in while she was still holding on to its leash....well....poor dirty Sanchez didn't make it....he was floating.... So I had to go into the dirty pond and get dead dirty Sanchez out....AND I had to carry a dead rabbit all the way back to our trailer since Kim was crying so bad.... then we had to leave the rabbit on the front step and wait till everyone was sleeping bc we aren't suppose to bury animals at the trailer park.... so....Never take a rabbit on a leash for a swim.
