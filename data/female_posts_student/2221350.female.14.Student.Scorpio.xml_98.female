The only one I have a problem with is the fact that she didn't want long quotes in our papers. I wrote my paper an extra 2 pages long so that I could accommodate the quote, and it's extremely important to my paper. My entire thesis is based on how moliere's plays reflect his dislike of the 17th century French bourgeois and people of the time. Besides all of that, she didn't even fucking read the quote, she assumed I put it in there to take up space, and she's wrong. It's like cutting a huge hole in my glory of a report and I had to spend the last hour removing the quote and picking up the shambles of a once beautiful thing. Aside from everything else, it's a beautiful quote, which is why I put it on here.    this is from LE MISANTHROPE, which is about, you guessed it, a misanthrope who DISLIKES THE BOURGEOIS! Just like someone else who is extremely important in the life of this report! fuck morehead and her stupid rule.  No, no, this formula you'd have me follow,                                                                     However fashionable, is false and hollow,                                                                                       And I despise the frenzied operations                                                                                                    Of all those barterers of protestations,                                                                                              Those lavishers of meaningless embraces,                                                                                     Those mutterers of obliging commonplaces,                                                                                      Who court and flatter everyone on earth                                                                                            And praise the fool no less than the man of worth.                                                                 Should you rejoice that someone fondles you,                                                                        Offers his love and service, swears to be true,                                                                                                                                        And fills your ears with praises of your name,                                                                  When to the first damned fop he'll say the same?                                                                             No, no; no self-respecting heart would dream,                                                                                   Of prizing so promiscuous an esteem;                                                                                   However high the praise, there's nothing worse                                                                                Than sharing honors with the universe.                                                                                        Esteem is founded on comparison:                                                                                           To honor all men is to honor none.  the words, the ideas, they give me goosebumps.  You know what i hate? i hate advertising. it's so annoying Especially these wildly invasive commercials that screech offers to you whilst a contradiction of what they say is at the bottom of the screen in tiny, almost but not quite unreadable prThe. the voices of these people((and maybe it's only becIuse i live in louisiana, the used car capital of the world)) are cacophony in it's purest form. they scream and yell and give me a headache. Unless it's Johnny Cash selling something, cause i like his voice. too bad about him dying and stuff.   ("Ring of Fire" to sell Preperation H, eh?)
