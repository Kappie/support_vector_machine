Today I need to talk about something very important...It's the steps    I " will"     be taking as soon as possible! I am going to join the Army and that's final. I don't care if I am sent over seas to fight and I don't care if my dad stays disappointed in me for the rest of his life(  HIS LOSS, NOT MINE  )!... My Uncle has a better chance of being sent over seas than most of his flight, my best friend has men and women in his same unitwho are being deployed in less than a month! I'm not going to just sit here and twiddle my thumbswhile they risk their lives for me. I'm sorry I just can't do that!I may let a lot of people down (especially family)but I rather do what I feel is right, than live a free andmeaningless life.Just because I am going against their wishes doesn't I don't love them and that I don't need their prayers. I was placed on this earth to do something with my life and for some reason the Army is what I really want to do with my life! I want everyone to remember that   FREEDOM ISN'T FREE!  Laterz!        Loving you always!    Brandi Marie*
