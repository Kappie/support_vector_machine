It's so complicated, I'm so frustrated,I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away,I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay,Should I say it, should I tell you how I feel,Oh, I want you to know,But then again I don't,It's so complicated. Just when I think I'm under control,I think I finally got a grip,Another friend tells me that,My name is always on your lips,They say I'm more than just a friend,They say I must be blind,Well I admit that I've seen you watch me,From the corner of your eye,Oh it's so confusing I wish you'd just confess,But think of what I'd be losing,If your answer wasn't yes. It's so complicated, I'm so frustrated,I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away,I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay,Should I say it, should I tell you how I feel,Oh, I want you to know,But then again I don't,It's so complicated. I hate it 'cause I've waited so long for someone like you,Should I say it,Should I tell you how I feel,Oh I want you to know,But then again I don't,It's so complicated.
