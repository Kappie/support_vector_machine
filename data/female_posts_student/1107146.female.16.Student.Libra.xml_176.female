I have yet to see it, cannot wait for seventh, which is when we might see it. The suspense is killing me. See?, I just died. Never mind me, I'm on drugs.  Time to get back in the studio, we're going to finish  Bitter , get some gigs, then start working on  Dust  Shadows  which, believe it or not, has all the work done for it already. Yes, I have no live.  The sun's out, thank god.
