But my friend said he wanted to see it (he ended up hating it too), and it was playing at the Ziegfeld, so I figured what the heck - at least it should have some good special effects.  And it did.  Those did not disappoint.  I also guess I can't say that the rest of the movie did disappoint, because I wasn't particularly looking forward to seeing it or anything.  But I guess I just didn't expect it to be as bad a movie as it really was.  For once,  urlLink I must disagree with A.O. Scott .  I mean, I suppose it is possible that the badness of this film was intentional, even though it wasn't billed that way.  But if that is the case, then I suppose it would be unforgivable.  I thought the point of the film was to raise awareness and get people to take the threat of global warming seriously.  But this film is simply too ludicrous to be taken seriously.    Ironically, the most offensive political devices in the film were not what bothered me the most.  I did not know or expect it to be so specifically referential to current political figures, and while I found this annoying, it could have been easily forgiven had the movie been good.    I have no idea whether the science of it is accurate or not.  I suspect that if another ice age does come, it will not happen over a span of hours or days, but I leave that to the experts.  I do know a thing or two about film, and I can honestly say that this is not how to make one.  So if you're thinking about it, stop and just don't.  Not even the presence of Dennis Quaid can save this film - and that, folks, is really saying something.
