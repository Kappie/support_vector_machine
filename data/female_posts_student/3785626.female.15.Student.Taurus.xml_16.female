Then after awhile we just talked. I really love spending time with him, it just makes me feel so HAPPY. Then after he left I went to sleep. He called around 4:30 or so. Then after awhile Kendra called. Then I ate. Then um..that was like it. Lol. I can't go to Jackson which sucks. I'm thinking if I really want to go I could ask Jamie if she wants me over or something. Anywho, hopefully Friday I can go to see I, Robot. Saturday I get to shop till I drop. I just hate going shopping with my brother cause he follows me around and tells me what I am buying is slutty. *rolls eyes* ANYWAYS I might buy some shorts for Band Camp cause it'll be hot and all. So yeeah. I might have to get me some real cheap tennis shoes for that, cause I don't wanna mess up my Chuck's ya know what I'm sayn. Go to Wally World or summin'. It don't matter. Anywho, I'm bored. Later. 3Cherry3sTregory3
