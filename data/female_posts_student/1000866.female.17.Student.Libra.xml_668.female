However, I've moved on and, in memory of my colors, I have Cheer Bear as my picture. :) She makes me happy. And, although I do really like your template, if you want to change it, I say, go for it! (Wow...Catie's advice blog. Haha) Anyway, thank you for leaving a comment. I appreciate it so much. :) It made me feel special.
