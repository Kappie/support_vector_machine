I just want to enjoy my life Although sometime i don't even know how to smile with my heart But at least i know how to smile  Than never to smile at all  Hurt is part of life But I know.... Time will erase all Like the season, change from summer to winter That's all the life will moving  Like a kaleidoscope  Once time i cry But i believe that next time i will smile as long as i have a hope I will try to make all better For me and for all  Keep Smile....!!!!  ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~
