I'm thinking of taking lilly downtown today since her swimming lessons are canceled. Poor baby, and she was so looking forward to them. It's raining. It's such a peaceful, lovely rain.  I like this kind of rain.  I still have to call cassie to see if she wants to go too. Mark's trying to get his licence today. GOOD LUCK! not that you read this... Oh well. Sophie is stalking birds through the window. It's a good thing she can't get out, or she'd never come back. She'd have too much fun terrorizing the neighborhood flocks. Such a darling little savage. I'll be back later, right now I have to see a man about a horse.  ~Me
