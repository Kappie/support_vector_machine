I be Kari and if you didn't already know that I live in Durand area. I don't know if much else should be put in here cuz if you are reading this you probley already know who I am.  Ok I shall tell about the mass confusion Jake and I caused yesterday. We went to see shrek 2 cuz we were bored and we wanted to hang out. So after we saw the movie we went to where Jake works to get foodage and all the ppl he works with saw me and as far as they know we are still together (which doesn't hurt my feelings any) So after we left they were talkin about if i was cute and the head cook said that i was and one of the waitresses said i wasn't. So the head cook said "she is cuter then you" and i guess she went and started ballin her eyes out. So when the manager told the waitress to close up she didn't tell the cook. So the poor cook had to stay late and finish closing up. Poor guy. I sorry I caused havic!  Onto my next thought. Ok I am stilling going out with Brenden and I know that in all honesty I don't really want to be. Yesterdday when Jake and i want to the movies we kinda....kissed. I know i shouldn't have but i couldn't help it i know i want to be with Jake I just don't know how to break up with Brenden cuz i told him that i would stay with him longer then a week and anyone who knows anything about this situation knows that it is weird and confusing but all i know is that i want to marry Jacob.  Ok no more sad story. I start Drivers traning tomorrow i am so excited. LOL.   So peace out
