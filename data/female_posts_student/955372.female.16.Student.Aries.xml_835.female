The dentist's office is right by where we used to live so, after having my mouth stabbed repeatedly with a little pointy stick (that could sound so wrong if put into the right context) we go and visit some old neighbors. Or rather my dad spoke to some old people while i counted how long I waited... in seconds... with no watch. Anyway, some of the people we visited were our old landlords, Tony and Lee (old married couple). Tony was a drug dealer for the mob. (so I'm sure our house was completely devoid of any stashes, and I'm CERTAIN Tony didn't buy that house with drug money. Note the sarcasm. Man can my parents pick 'em). Anyway Tony got busted and was in jail for most of the time that we lived in that house. But anywhat while we were visiting them Lee said "oh look how big she's (me) gotten! I remember when we used to babysit her." ok think about that. That one sentence there has made me COMPLETELY question my childhood. My parents, geniuses that they are, let DRUG DEALERS babysit me. When I was an infant and couldn't protect myself. Ok in case you didn't get that let me say it again. They let drug dealers, who worked for the mob, take care of they're infant child. How am I still alive? I mean with the amazing taste they had in babysitters, how did I manage to survive to the age of 15. Good lord! I seriously think that I am still here because of sheer dumb luck. hahaha what parents.
