I think I'm really just disgusted with myself.   I'm dealing with some issues right now, some people, some things of my past.It just won't go away.  He  won't go away .  I'm not running. I'm standing right here facing it, just very, very still. Isn't that enough?   I won't say I'm sorry for what I did. I'm sorry certain things happened. I'm sorry that you didn't like that. But I am not sorry for being who I am and the way I am.I will always be...this.It's the one thing that never changes, the one constant in the world: my brokenness.    You can either turn away now, or prove me wrong by actually accepting this. For now.      --Lied.   She lied again. You knew.   Little girls grow up to be wives, and they lose all their dreams and aspirations.  No, not her.  There's so much that she could be, if  only she tried... and tried hard.  But she's hostile and hot tempered, unwilling to change her ways.   She lied again. You knew.   You never look at me, he said. You look,  but your eyes never seem to really meet mine.  Yeah, she knows; she's perfected it  as a way to get inside your mind, and keep you out of hers.  She's distant. LOOK AT HER.  See how distant she is?   She lied again. You knew.   Freedom to choose, freedom to fight;  it's what she believes in, what she stands for,  yet when she has it, she gives it away.  Freedom means honesty, and of that,  she already has too little.  Lying is her way of trying to mend what was broken.  Her way of beating the game. And she'll beat it. She always beats it.   But she lied again. And she didn't care that you knew.
