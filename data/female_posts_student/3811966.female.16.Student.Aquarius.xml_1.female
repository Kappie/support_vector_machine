She's going to help me in my studies, so all the more I  must  work  extra hard  now, so that I wouldn't let her down.  She really has encouraged me alot.  In a way, she's sort of like my ex-teacher  Ms Tan , who also encouragedme to study hard.  Both of them are my favourite teacher .  I have decided to email Kay today. Hope that I will get a reply from her. Monday would be  Youth Day , so there wouldn't be school. Celebrated in school. Had a '  PHS    Idol '. Was really very funny.  Mr Lai ,  Mrs Lau  and  Mrs Wong  were the judges. Contestants were  Mr Ng ,  Mr Sim ,  Mr Ang ,  Ms Teo ,  Ms Sibira ,  Mrs Ang ,  Mr Teo ,  Mr Wee ,  Mr Lau  and our principal  Mrs Tan . We had lots of laughter hearing the teachers sing. The judges were equally funny too. We had a ball of a time. Some of the teachers (Ms Sibiria, Mr Wee, Mr Lau, Mr Ng, Ms Teo) sang quite well, and so did Mrs Tan.  Really enjoyed the concert .  Well, think I'll end of here for today. Going to send the email to Kay.  -  "To get the full value of joy, you must have someone to divide it with."   Mark Twain   *Listening to   [This I Promis You]   by   N'Sync
