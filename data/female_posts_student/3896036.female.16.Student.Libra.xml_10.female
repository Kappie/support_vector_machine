After econs paper yesterday, i went with christine, crystal, boon and kelly to get the CD. So happy! Waited one year for it!  But.. it isnt as good as I expected. Maybe my expectations are too high? hee. But ya.. kind of disappointed. The album has less R, less songs which style are like dui bu qi (fantasy) and tong yi zhong diao diao (ye hui mei). Some songs are so similar to his other songs.. the 1st song, wo de di pan, reminds me so much of san nian er ban (yhm) and jiang jun is so much like the song he wrote for jolin, hai dao. His ballads in qlx are just so-so, they are far from the standard of An Jing, Kai Bu Liao Kou, Long Juan Feng and Hui Dao Guo Qu. Interestingly, Vivian Hsu didnt write any lyrics for this album of his... Lyrics were mainly from vincent fang (duh!), and geng hong wrote one for Jay too.  I like Qi Li Xiang (track 2) though, sounds unique and has a style of its own. Yuan You Hui (track 9) also sounds great, very "bright", "fresh" and "cheerful". Track 10 seems to be the only rap song i like so far, hope the more i listen to qlx, the more I'll enjoy it.  Fantasy is still my favourite album ^-^!
