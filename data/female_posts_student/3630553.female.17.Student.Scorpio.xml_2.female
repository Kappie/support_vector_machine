You’ve dried the flowing river, in the windows of my soul; You gave me a haven, And a shoulder to fall.  You knew all of me, yet I’m all a mystery; I was so invisible, yet you see me so clearly.  We had so much together, that we barely noticed, the clock was speedier; It was beauty and bliss.  You’ve mended my wounds, and made me even stronger, but just to see another bid, of adieu from a lover.  I feel so deprived, now that you’re there, and I am right here, feeling lost in the nowhere.  Was it something I said? Was it something I did? From all the places we’ve gone, it ended bitterly as this.  And I want you to know, I wasn’t trying to change you; This place in my deepest, you possess because of you.  How I wish you could hear, my heart breaking like this; How I wish you could read, my mind speaking of bliss.  You’re there and I’m here, feeling so out of place. Tell me, where is the love that lit my blue darkened face?    (a piece I heartily dedicate to someone I used to call “!_@|3z”)
