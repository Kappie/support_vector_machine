I have to stay awake even no matter how hard my eyes demand for a sleep and my body for a short nap. Exams, homework and night activities obligated me to stay up even until3 AM. Ugh! And I think I'm already insomniac. " Mega-insomniac " -I call myself! Haha! Coffee, cup noodles, hot chocolates, crackers and midnight snacks - those kinds of food I wasn't used to - fill my tummy every night and then. Calculus, accounting, sciences, history and other academic books occupy my table almost entirely. Papers due tomorrow and projects due the day after tomorrow drive me nuts. Come inside my room andcheck outmy table calendar filled with "IMPORTANT" and "URGENT" notes.  Phew!   No, I am not crammer and I avoid to cram as much as possible,but what would you expect from college, anyway? It's not like having to memorize word by word and ace the fill in the blanks test with all the obvious answers.   And though I'm merely a sophomore in our country's premier state university, I've learned quite a lot of college strategies, experienced paranoia, and seen some oddness. Having resided inside a dormitory during my freshman year, I was able to point out the big (if not, HUGE) differences between being a high school teenybopper and being a college young woman. I've learned that in college, you can study the whole subject coverage and fail a test; and you can also NOT study the whole subject coverage and ace a test; that you and your roommate will always have major differences which may even lead to minor misunderstandings; that you don't have to stand during class recitations; that youdon'thave to greet every professor arriving in the classroom;that you can cut classes and throw no big deal; that you have to deal with upperclassmen more often than you expect; that social life is the life; that skipping a lunch (and sometimes, not even having to eat lunch) is a normal routine; that curfews give you the shit; that staying up late with Mr. and Mrs. Algebra is a must or else, etc..  But then, such challenges are what make college life magnanimously incredible. There is more to knowledge than what is echoed inside the four corners of the classroom. As Spidermanoncesaid: "Of great power comes great responsibilities." Our lives are more relevant when we handle responsibilities. Life is well spent when we have a goal - a never-ending goal. A friend of mine, who was our school paper editor-in-chief, also once quoted, "If you aim for the roof, you'd fall on the floor. But if you aim for the sky, you'd fall on the roof." And as for that, I say -it's always worth a try. Like time, opportunities are more precious than gold.  And surely, every effort we exert is effort well spent if we have an objective. And as for me staying up so late, I dohave an objective. As a matter of fact, life itself, by the end of the day, is a big objective -an objective that breaks the dawn of a successful tomorrow.   Phew!   Ah, this is it!I couldn't even feel my eyes blinking anymore. I really am insomniac. "Mega-insomniac".   I can see the sunrays now...  The dawn is breaking...  I knew that dawn would break... I always knew the dawn would break...
