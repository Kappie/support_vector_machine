I watched one of my favorite movies, Forrest Gump.  I love that movie.   Also went putt-putting today...forgot to mention that.  I tied for second the first time, won the second.  I failed to win at the games...tip of the entry: anything you put coins into to knock off coins is not worth tokens. I love getting my butt whooped at internet checkers.  For once, I'm actually winning.  Yea, I won!  I guess people are stupid at 11:15 PM.  I'm tryin my hardest to stay up for SNL, which is why I'm at the computer and not watching the news...that always puts me to sleep.  Last week, I fell asleep one commercial before the opening skit (my sister told me). Two games in a row won!!!  Three!!  You know, this makes me think about my cousin Stephanie.  We haven't played internet games lately.  Actually, we haven't really seen each other lately. For my perverts out there, does holding up two fingers really mean you want to get some?  Some people tried to tell me that, and I got it flashed to me twice yesterday.  I personally don't believe it, but it could be true.  Well I g2g.  Later.    Forrest Gump!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
