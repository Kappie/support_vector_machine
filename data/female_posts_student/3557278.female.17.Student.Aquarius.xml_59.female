As per usual there were a few typos in the exam :S it was stupid, but i think i went pretty decent. there was only this one stupid exponential/hyperbolic graph that i didn't know 100% how to answer but i still wrote *something*.  Then i had english... oh and we got our exam timetable for the dreaded trials. Yuck! Bio was next... pretty boring cos all we did was write an essay on quarantine, and then go find some diseased leaves... hehe, but i found a pretty leaf :)  After that was SAC, which supprisingly want *that* bad. We just went to the library, and miss gave me the class page for the yearbook. it's pretty funny and she mentions Jen  myself as the animal rights liberators or something hehehe!  THEN we had HOCKEY HOCKEY HOCKEY!!! it was SO cool! We got to play on TURF.. YES THAT'S RIGHT! WATER BASED ASTROTURF WHICH I *LOVE* PLAYING ON! hehe sorry about that i got carried away.. it's such a faster game! i love it :):):)  oh yeah, lol we WON 2 nil! yay go Greystanes - Sydney West open Hockey knockout champs.
