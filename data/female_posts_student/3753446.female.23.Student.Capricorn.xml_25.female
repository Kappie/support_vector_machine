I still have 2 papers, a quiz, and 7 finals to take. however, I felt this would be a good writing point too. Honestly, I've been craving some alone time to just gush all my thoughts freelance onto paper, no time limit, no reality limit.. just throw it out quietly to the universe, and be safe in letting go of my background noise (worries, negative thoughts, sadness, fears). I recently lost a friend in a tragic car accident. She was an inspirational girl who touched all the lives she knew (and THEN SOME).   Spiritually, intellectually, even physically, I've accepted her passing. Though I know that I could, I am not going to take this opportunity to gush and rave all about her life. We have all done that and those of us who knew her well know that words are not necessary to understand those simple qualities about her that made her so special to us all. In this critical time, many of my friends have lauded my "strength" and "energy".. "how do you do it Sanjida?" I hear...And yes I know I tend to be off the wall at times... that I can be the world's greatest actress if it helps me get through a difficult time... that I love to have fun, but more than that, see that my loved ones are happy... and my loved ones grow in quantity day by day...   If only they knew.. after all whatever it is that I do is yet so small.   I remember Sr Aminah (my mentor) said once that since she accepted Islam, her heart expanded to be filled with love for all of Allah ta'alas Craetions...that at times, she felt so loved and loving, that she feared her heart may burst with positive energy...wow... what a state of Iman (faith)..   I realized yesterday that with 9-11 and Islam awareness becoming a major issue, as well as Tamina's death, and the 23 credit hours, and the campus job, and extracurriculars, and a social life... this has been one CRAZY BUSY semester... I feel at once, that i have lost so much and yet gained even more. in Ecclesiastes it says "To everything there is a season..." and in Asr it says "By Time, verily, man is in loss." That is SO true. This was the time for me and those around me to be tried, in our faith, in our actions, in our characters.   Well, to give the abridged update of S life, I'm back into playing violin. i love it with a new passion. I saw Midori perform last night at the Orchestra and it was so absolutely beautiful I was not only awestruck but speechless.   I've learned to defer stress for teh finer thigns in life.. friends, love, sleep, chocolate, smiles and hugs... Such amazing healing mechanisms in all of these.   I have much more I wish to share with, um, my secret admirer? Who else would come here? but alas, I am exhausted and my bed is beckoning with that come hither look that I just cannot resist... gnight friends.
