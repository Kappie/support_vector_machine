Second, do not expect anything to avoid misunderstandings and future hurts...(a precaution especially needed on the net). Be part of the game and go with the flow...so to speak.  Third, know the meaning of " I see...", "Hmmm...", "Hmph..."; well, sometimes these responses are so negative and confusing... I mean, let's start with "I see...", this usually means, one agrees on one's statement...but, there will be more buts...even without the "why's". Then, there's "Hmmm...", which usually means, "Let me think, is this for real? Or is he/she telling the truth?" Which leads to doubt...nevertheless, we still want to think it's the truth. And then, "Hmph!"...Well, this response is usually used when one reall scoffs at the idea being presented, or frankly speaking...rejects it as a lie and no truth in whatever one is saying...It's a good "naglalambing" technique...  Fourth, start a BLOG...it can really help ease tense muscles...and a very good substitute for a pet..since it only listens to your ranting and raving...  Fifth, "Me have got to have a life!"...
