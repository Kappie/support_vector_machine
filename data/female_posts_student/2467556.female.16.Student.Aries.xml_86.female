Why? because he told me that my shirt wasn't passing dress code when it was! My entire class was even like "what the hell? your shirt does pass dress code".  Maxanne, this girl in my class, said "if your shirt is low cut then mine is super low cut".  He said that my shirt was too low cut and my midriff was showing when in reality the shirt i was wearing was one of the few that doesn't show my midriff at least a little bit and it was not low cut.  So he gave me one of those stupid dress code passes to go the office with.  I went to Mrs. Springer and told her what happened and how my shirt did pass and the 2 APs that were with her agreed that it did etc....and she sent me with a note that said my shirt was ok and i had to sit in Mrs. Phillips office for the 5 mins left in the period.  I was sooo mad though because he embarassed me in front of the entire class.  I swear he is such a child and it bothers me.  Its one thing to act funny and kid around but you should know when to act serious and say something to a student privatley depending on the topic.  There were better ways he could've handled it.  And there were some people in my class that were not passing dress code period, but he picks on me! I think he seriously hates me and he underestimates my intelligence.  I think that he thinks i'm just another one of those stupid bimbo girls that don't know a thing about history and could care less which is not true about me at all.  I was the 4th girl he had sent all day.    Yeah so i have 2 tests and 2 quizzes tomorrow......should i study? yeah. am i studying? no.  Coppell vs Jesuit tonight, 9:30pm, *prays*  One more day and then spring break! ~~~Taylor~~~
