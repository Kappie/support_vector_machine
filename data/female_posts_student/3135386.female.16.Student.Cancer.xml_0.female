For anyone who hasn't had contact lenses, basically they stick a pair on, and send you to the waiting room for 20 mins so they can see how your eyes adjust to them. Now, getting to the waiting room was interesting. Normally they try you with a pair of lenses that match your prescription, but I have a wierd one (perscription that is), so they put over-corrective lenses on me. The nurse people made fun of me as I staggered like a drunk to the waiting room...Hey, it looked straight to me!  I actually was a little bit apprehensive to getting tested. I must say, thankfully I'm friends with the doctor, we go to karate and that. He's a funny guy. *grins*   My best friend's little sister actually at his rotten cheeseburger yesterday and went home sick. None of us can understand how she ate half the burger when the meat was blue and white, and the cheese was green, and not realise that something was horribly wrong. Oh well, I hear she's feeling a bit better this evening.  Thankfully all the snow is gone. It was actually +24 yesterday, and our maths teacher took us all outside. I tanned a bit. *grins*  Only 20 more days of school, 10 days until our band trip, and approx 41 days until I go to Brazil.  Anyway, I'm talking to Mal now and a friend of her's named Kristy, for the first time in ages...and I have to go study for a Geo test tomorrow. *groan*  Must remember to take that cd!  Tchau!
