Now I won't be able to drive til the end of February. Well, I guess the one perk is that when I can drive again, i can legally drive people. No this sucks. No more movie wednesdays at charlottes or going out to lunch or to the mall or on a date or ANYTHING. I never get to see any of my friends anymore as it is. I don't have classes with ANY of my best friends anymore. No more language with charlotte, josh, or caitlin or pottery with nick and erinn. Least I have Rachael in math now. Ugh life sucks.  Call me, please?
