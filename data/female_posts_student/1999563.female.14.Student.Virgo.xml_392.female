He got SO mad! It made my giggle. Did you hear I am becoming asaian? I am dying my hair black and getting surgery to my eyes  so then I will look asaian! "No you wont." Thanks Aaron.  Today at tennis it started PORING rain! It was sue-wheat! So I smelled it. Rain smells so good. so we all ran inside. Then I had to call my mom but no one was home so I wandered around the prarie halls for a half an hour.  It was fun. Hhaha. Then my mom was like "You can go to prarie next year if you want!!" and i was like no thanks...  So now I am still wet. It grand. I feel so fresh. And considering I haven't taken a shower in three days (shhhh..I know its sick...I like being dirty!) Its nice to feel clean again.  Hmm.  Hahhahhahahahahhaha  Tonight is the apprentice final! How exciting!
