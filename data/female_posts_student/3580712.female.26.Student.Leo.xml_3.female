Each day you have to exfoliate to keep fresh.  Exfoliating in a beauty routine is to remove dull, dead skin cells to instantly reveal smooth, healthy skin.     As a notice the spring I also noticed I have been starting over(spiritually,professionally)  This is a daily routine to keep me motivated and radiant.   May peace fill your hearts.
