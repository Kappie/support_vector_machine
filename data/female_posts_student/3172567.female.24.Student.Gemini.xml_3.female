And, like in most of the rest of my life, my friend for the longest time, (not my "oldest" friend) Karen, has inspired me to start a blog.  So, back to that revenge issue.  About four years ago, I journeyed down the path of sketch.  I had only been with Joel for 2 years at that point, and I cheated.  I don't know if we hit the 2 year mark, and I freaked out having never had a relationship last longer then 2 months or what.  But I did it, and I was not proud.  I didn't tell him, because it was a mistake, and it didn't really mean anything.  I had a lot of sleepless nights, I can tell you that much.  Well, I got mine.  I found out Sunday that Joel had been cheating on me with a friend of mine.  A 17 year old friend of mine.  He and Lauren had been seeing each other for about a month or so.    Through a various sequence of events I got this info, while I was at work with her.  I told her that I knew, and I walked out of the room.  "That's great.  I don't care." -The Bride to Vernita Green, Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  When I came back in the room, she proceeded to tell me that she was sorry.  And how it had just been eating her up inside that she was doing this to me.  Then she had the nerver to tell me that "everything comes full circle" and implied that this was my fault for cheating first.  By the end of the day, I convinced myself that I wasn't mad at her anymore.  I believe I did that just so I could get through the rest of the day without stabbing her.    He apologized profusely.  Begged for my forgiveness.  Profusely.  I made him explain it all to me.  I came to the conclusion that I believed his explanation that it was a huge mistake, and it didn't mean anything to him.  Understandable.  I'd been in the same situation.  When I was still feverishly pissed, I told him that I cheated, because I wanted him to be as mad as I was.  It worked.  We have forgiven each other.  Everything is good between him and I.  "You and I have unfinished business."  -The Bride, Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  Since I convinced myself I wasn't mad at her, and I really was, I had some stuff to tell her.  So I called her, and I told her that she was no longer aloud to speak to him.  At all.  And if I found out that they were talking, that's it.  It for me and Joel, It for me and her, and probably it for her and Joel too, because I'm becoming a finely tuned ass-kicking machine in Taekwondo.  I delivered the same instructions to him as well.  I believe that Joel is good.  He won't try to keep a friendship with her.  Her on the other hand, I do not trust her any further that I can pick her little butt up and throw her.  Because in addition to fooling around with Joel behind my back, she was sleeping with a guy from school behind Joel's back.  Slut.  Well, there you have it.  My very first post on my very first blog.  Incase you were wondering about the url, the title and the quotes...I have an obsession with Kill Bill.  Before Uma kills anyone in the movie, she reminds them that they have "unfinished business."  And if by chance, you have been in a hole and you have missed the movie, Hattori Hanzo is a character in the movie  (based on a character from old samurai shows) that makes swords.  That's where "cutyoulikeahanzo" comes from.    Well, it is time for laundry and hair straightening.  More later.  Peace.
