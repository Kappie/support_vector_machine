I can't believe we pulled that off, it was a miracle of god.  and the stupid finn, Ville Nieminen, boarded our dear Vincent Lecavalier and now he has a gash in his beatiful head. *tear* Now his hair will be messed up!!!  So Ville Nieminen is officially on Brittany and I's hitlists. On my hitlist, i made him second to Todd Marchant, the guy who hit Niko really hard last season.  He's probably top on Britt's hitlist.  There are several things that are evil in life and here are the top 3: a) manual cars, b) ovens and c) Ville Nieminen/Jarome Iginla.  alright so anyways, Lightning won and the next game is on Thursday on ABC at 7pm. Emily seems to think that the Flames are going to win....psh whatever! Speaking of the Flames, my brother said the funniest thing yesterday about them!!  Here's how it went down:   *me and Dillon are watching the game*   Dillon:  which team do we want to win?  Me:  Tampa Bay, the ones in blue and white  Dillon:  oh....are we playing the Soviets!?!  Me:   *laughs hysterically*  Dillon, that was in the movie Miracle, the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore...  Dillon:  But the other team's jerseys are red and have big C's on them!!!  Doesn't that mean that they're communist?  They look like they're the soviets!  Me:   *laughs even harder*  The Soviet Union fell at least 15 years ago, it doesn't exist! Thats why we have all those annoying little countries with their hard-to-pronounce capitals to remember! The team in the red is the Calgary Flames and they're from Canada....and they're not communist!  Dillon:  well they look communist..... *walks away*  ^ man i love Dillon, he cracks me up  so anyways, family came over....but i didn't really talk to them, i was watching the game.  We ate hamburgers for memorial day and stuff like that.  Ro wanted me to come hang out, but i couldn't because my mom wanted me to hang out at home with family....even though i didn't really talk to them.  way to go mom.  gotta go.....oh wait....and do nothing.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
