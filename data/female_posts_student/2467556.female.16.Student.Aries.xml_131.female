Team Finland lost in OT to Team Canada......that means they have to play the bronze medal game at the World Championships *tear*  My poor Niko!!!!!!  He was supposed to win the Gold!!!!!!  oh well its cool, i still love him!!!!   I also went out to dinner with Nathaniel to talk about everything since his breakup.......we really needed to talk, it was important and all.    Tampa Bay vs. Philly tomorrow at 2pm!!!!!  PHILLY IS GOING DOWN BRITTANY!!!!!  VINNY, NIKKI AND MARTIN WILL TAKE THE FLYERS DOWN!!!!!!!!!  Everyone needs to remember this: ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: this is the moment of my life...where i officially chose Drake over Mike...for a number of reasons...1) Drake is 17...not 33 2) Drake can play the guitar 3) Drake can actually sing 4) No offense to Mike or anything...but i think Drake has more personality than Mike...5) Although Mike DOES play hockey which makes him SO much more of a man...Drake is guarnteed to not get his face ruined by flying pucks...high sticks and illegal boarding 6) and 6...Drake has his own TV show...and he's funny....there i am done...this is a HUGE turning point in my life...BUT Mike will always be my baby...and i will love him forever and ever, he's just gonna have to share me with my younger companion...that's all...as Mike gets older...i'll need someone to keep up with me...and i think Drake is a perfect match...and the first child that i have with Drake..i will name Michael Thomas Bell in honor of my first love ^Brittany has given up Mike ladies, feel free to take him.....but i would strongly advise you not to because Brittany has installed an anarchy in coppell.....and she'll murder you, but if you're brave...go for it!  Schedule for my weekend:  Saturday: 2pm to 3 - hockey game Tampa Bay vs. Philadelphia                  around 3 - project time for history with Jen, Katie and Carrie!                  8pm to 11:30pm - Tearing up the Dance floor with Jessi at her church dance!
