I was just checking up on some random friend's live-journals/blogs and I found that my friend  Jerry Roberts  wrote about me in his journal, saying some of the most wonderful things an old friend could say. I never knew that I had made a difference to him, but, according to this I sure did. I sure feel good right now.   ok, so the title is a lie, nothing of any interest happened to me when I wrote that title, but by the time I got back to my journal entry to finish it, I had something to talk about. So I talked with Liz tonight. She's on old friend, the first really good friend I made in High School. She was the first person that actually made me feel like, if I tried, I could work myself out of the social catastrophic state/malcontent with life that I was somehow mired into from Middle School. Dirty Middle School years. Well, turns out Liz is coming to A town in a couple weeks to see a fellow VSU pal. So briefly this got me reflecting on what I really accomplished in High School. Ok, not really yet, but as I'm lying in my bed tonight, waiting to be whisked away into that fabulous world of sweet rest, I'm sure the topic will be on my mind.    I just had to share that. This reminds me that we never really know who we are influencing on a day to day basis, and sometimes we dont know how much good we are really doing. There is hope for us all yet.    We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by doing them . ~Thucydides(460-400B.C.)
