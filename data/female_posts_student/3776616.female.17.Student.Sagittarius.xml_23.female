Oh well, everything's fixed now, so it's all good.  Anyway...  sorry I haven't really been answering calls/talking long/calling when I said I would.  My voice won't go above a whisper at the present time.  I'm going to Urgent Care to get a strep test and whatnot, but I have be dragged to Milton for my sis's 4-H picnic thing first.  So Pookie, I might be able to stop in and see you at work *crosses fingers*  umm... Bethy I might call you tomorrow otherwise I'll just wait until you call on Weds, and I'll see you on Thurs.  Sam... idk if you read this or not, but we really need to talk.  So I'll call you as soon as I get my voice back.  Plus we can go to the gym then too, before you go on vacay, b/c I'll be leaving for Fla. shortly after you get back, and by then it'll be almost the middle of August...  Other things...  Ken I'll try to call you back when I get home tonight I'm not sure what time it will be or how much I'll be able to talk but I'll give it a try.  Mande I'll see you tomorrow at 9:15 are we supposed to bring anything or is she going to have all the cleaning supplies?  EEEEEK...  I need to stop spazzing and mom's ready to go so I'll talk to everyone w/in the next few days. Later.
