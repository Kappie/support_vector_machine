I have to do my science experiment and then type out some stuff so that I can paste it over into powerpoint and send the powerpoint presentation to my lab instructor.  BLAH!  I just wanna get it over with.  Then I have my lab final on Saturday...!  WOOHOO!  Then I think I'm driving up to Kerrville... my parents, Rob, and Kathy are going up to visit my Grandma on Saturday.  Since my Grandma's moving in with my Aunt and Uncle, she's got a lot of stuff she needs to give away.  So, she asked Rob and Kathy if they'd like her dining room table and her bed for their new house (it'll be done in August sometime)... so they're gonna go check it out and make a decision.  It'd really help them out to not have to buy some of these things.  Anyhow, I don't have work tomorrow... and I don't have much else to do... I think I'm going to tidy things up a bit... although they're still pretty spic and span from last weekend when I had people over before going to Hermann's Happiness.  Man... I'm so glad that I got things with my schedule for next Fall figured out a bit more... I'll have one MWF class (at noon) and 3 classes on Tues/Thurs in the morning hours... then one W night class (a lab with the science class that's on MWF)... adds up to 13 hours... and I may squeeze in one more class if I can... they've been adding more stuff on.  THANK GOD!  Anyhow... I'm off now... gotta get my experiment done.
