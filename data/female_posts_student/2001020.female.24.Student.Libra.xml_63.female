I create this drama that I'm dealing with! Second year of law school has gone so much faster and produced much more personal confusion than ever! I am happier though, especially since I broke up with that good for nothing Mike. What the hell was I thinking? I see him and I am reminded daily that I'm a complete and utter jackass when it comes to choice of males. I am really good at making mistake after mistake, aren't I? When will that stop? I guess the new theme of this school year is trying to screw me...well, not for everyone, but I've gotten propositioned more than I like by dudes with girlfriends. And I'm not down for it, exactly. Who knows. I just want a nice guy to want me for my mind and who I am, not my body. But the worst part is that I have to stop taking that as the only solution to my indifference towards men. I am numb, and I'm scared, because I'm making so many mistakes and I can't snap out of being numb. There is one person who really really touches me in my life right now, but he has a girlfriend of two years and no matter what happens between us, I'll never be more than the "other woman" in his life. And that kills. I hate cheaters. I hate homewreckers. But I just haven't met anyone for almost three years who has affected me and touched my heart the way he does. So how do I reconcile that dream with the reality?
