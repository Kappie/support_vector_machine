It may just be allergies or something. If it is allergies than this is the worst I have ever had. I woke up really late today. I think it was after 2. I went to bed at 4 or something... I couldn't sleep, I never can during summer. I really need to get out.. soon. I'm going crazy not doing something, and schools out. This is lame!! lol
