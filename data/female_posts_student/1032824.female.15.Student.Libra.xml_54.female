Joshua .  I have to  thank   yulun . for the past coupla' days, he has been teasing me about  "si-car-lly"  sitting with joshua. especially when we wenta' the mall that day. he was all, "  WHAT IF  you were to sit with joshua? what would you do?  i casually replied while laughing out loud,  "haha that is impossible! it can't be that coincidental right?"    Then this morning when i saw the new class seating plan, i nearly passed out. i was scanning the piece of paper. i finally saw my name. i was anxious to read the name of the person who would be sitting beside moi. very very nervous. everything seemed so...  slow motion-ed , and so dramatic.   Indeed , it turned out to be J-O-S-H-U-A.     Wow , life is overwhelmed with  irony , ain't it??   My life rocks .   Jiax  and i gave  ms halizah  the cold shoulder today. gave her attitude prob during her 5 lessons with us too. cos' basically, jiax can't sit with  jason (weihoong). they quarrel 24/7 and just can't get along. as for me, it is a fact that josh really is pretty dirty when it comes to personal hygiene =\ and i can't quite get along with him either. don't say i ain't trying, i have. we are okay together.. but, i can't open up to him like i do to  yulun . we don't joke, we don't talk, we don't laugh, we don't sing, we don't do anything together! and it really sucks if i have to sit with the same person for the entire day when we don't even communicate.  i miss yulun....  * bleahx*  well, not only did ms halizah put jiax and i with somebody whom we don't feel comfy around with, she put jiax,  fengrui (gabriel kor),  yulun (martin kor) and i each at a different corner. and  nic  is right at the centre.  kalyn (dingling) got to sit with fengrui. sighs. at least they can still talk..  amily  is sitting with  jeremy  kor. =( *sobs* how cool.  jess  sitting with  hafiz ,  ruth  and  simon . aaahhh.. my best friends are all so far away.. so so far away.  During the peer leaders and prefects' meeting after skl, jason told me that he has informed ms halizah about wanting to change his seats. he told her that he wouldn't mind sitting with me. so hopefully, ms halizah would put us together. i am praying SO hard that this would happen.
