All of my exams (I think) went pretty well. I hope they did, anyway. Then mom lilly and I went to Ben Franklin's to get balloons and grounds to get coffee. The coffee was delicious. The conversation was a little disturbing though. Anyway, a whole bunch of friends and I are going to see Big Fish tonight and I'm excited because it's a really good movie and I don't get to go out with these people all that often. Oh well, I'm off. Overall, this hasn't been a terribly horrible day. Some parts I could certainly do without, but oh well. It will be over soon.  tata
