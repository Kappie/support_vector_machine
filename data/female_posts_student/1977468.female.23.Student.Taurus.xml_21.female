The universe needed a means and a vessel to forment this accretiously apocryphal scheme, a young sycophant by the name of Dave. The time had come for change. The time had come...   for an update   (ubiquitous thundering thundery noises)  Yes. I have returned from my divergence of social presence, a parting of who's sole purpose being the recalibration of my inner locos of artistic voice. A parting long overdue... so understandably it also occurs as a parting long overdrawn.  In any case, here's the shiz. My summer plans have been made and can be best summerized by the use of a semi collen; lots of gigs at larger venues, a trip to England for graduation, more gigs and the recording of our first album, a week long tour around washington / idaho for extended gig coverage AND whatever else happens to happen. The summer shall be a musical one, and im preparing mentally and equipmentally wise for the long hours of hard rockege. I'm also working on my serious rock swaying in the mirror.   Lessons have been beneficial and frequent ebaying has lead to the addition of a few items which will hopefully get me closer to the sound and tones in my head, as opposed to the ones coming from a crackling near-dead 1/4 cable I regret buying on account of it being cheaper then the others. go here. www.explodingdog.com   This man is a genius. I will post some of his pictures here when they seriously hit home... for now this one does the job nicely:   http://www.explodingdog.com/january1/whitesound.html   As long as im posting shiz  look for the Still-life website to be up soon. I'll post the link when its actaully operational.  Both proms were success as they rocked, but now a third prom looms near, the way this will play out remains a mystery. I'm trying to remain circumspective...TRYING to. I'm basically a "Get out of not having a prom date and having a horrible time at home alone with your bad 80ies music Free Card" (that was a monopoly reference).   I decided to start reading things, things that are actaully interesting. Maybe they will help my writing. I'm also thinking about starting and finishing a novel idea I've been working on, which should take awhile. I'm working out now too, 5 days a week as a matter of fact. weights every other day with running inbetween. What else... I'm emotionally stable. Currently anyway, ask me again in five minutes and I'll be painting pictures of headless birds swimming in an ocean of abandonment with the sky collapsing.
