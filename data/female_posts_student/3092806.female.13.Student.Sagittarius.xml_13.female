I'm trying to cut back on computer time but there is absolutely nothing else to do so I always end up turning to the computer for entertainment. What's a thirteen year old girl to do during the summer? There is absolutely nothing to do, I swear! I have watched like a hundred movies, gone swimming, gone bike riding, played basketball, watched television, played video games, etc... I've even started creating schedules for myself during the school year. The boredom bug has bit me. Anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? Anyone even out there? Oh, this is pointless.   You know Kate? Well, I think we, my sister and I,officially broke things off with her. I've probably wrote this once or twicebefore but this time I believe it's for sure. All right, Nicole was on the computer this morning, on AIM. Kate signed on. Things were going justfine until Kate badmouthed Nicole about something. This led into a big fight. It was just a regular fight of ours, that is until my 17 year old brother, Nick, stepped in. Kate violated his privacy and he didn't like that all that much. He totally blew up at her. This immediately caused her to be pissed off at us. So, therefore when we say her today, she gave us the "finger." She's such a lovely nine yearold girl, huh? Don't you just want to hug her? NOT!!! Ugh, sometimes she can just be so incredibly mean, nasty, bossy and rude. I'm not just typing about her "flipping the bird." I'm writing about all of the other terrible things that she's said or done to my sister and I. Argh, this is making me think about her brother. NO!!!!!   I hate thinking about her brother. That was just another friendship that went bad. He's very cruel to Cole andI now. He calls us dykes, bitches, and other foul words. I don't even communicate with him anymore. It's SO stupid, SO pathetic. He seriously needs to grow up. Ah, if we leave him alone then why does he punish us so? What have I done, besides not tell him about my ex boyfriend, Seth? Honestly, am I terrible person? Am I the worst person in the entire world? Tell it to me straight now, I want to know. I'm so sick of all of the lies he tells other people about my sister and I, the cold jokes he makes about Nicole and I, etc... I'm tired of wondering. I WANT to KNOW WHY!!! Couldn't he at least grant the courtesy of telling his victim's on WHY he's torturing them? Or is he as ruthless as he appears? Ugh, I let go of him, I even wrote that in here... Did I really, though? I have the feeling that I'm still not over our whole friendship thingy...   Er!!! I'm going to bed. It's part of my schedule.  *rolls eyes*  Sometimes I am just such a freak.   And I'm out of here.
