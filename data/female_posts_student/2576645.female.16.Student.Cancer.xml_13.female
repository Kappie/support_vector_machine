All I can really say is how much I hope people don't think I 'm a geek for writing in my blog twice in one day.   'Cuz right now, that is my self image.  I know what your thinking: '.....uummm....do you really care that much?...are you THAT addicting to it?' To answer your questions:  YEAH!  For some odd reason (I have an inkling it might be pride), my blog is the fiirst place I go when I sign on. Even if I don't write it in.....I feel a strange pulling feeling of having to look at it.   People are complimenting me on how fun my blog is to read...which got me thinking...  If it is this easy to entertain people...I should do this for a living someday. It could be that my friends are just incredibly easy to amuse (which is a likely option, since I myself have been captivated by how the clothes spin around-and-around-and-around when I look in my grandma's washermachine's glass door) but I'd like to think not.  See, the only thing I would love to improve upon is my sense of  story-telling. Satpreet tells the greatest stories...full of detail and creativity. I feel the need to put things bluntly, becuase if I don't, I feel as though I'm not being true to myself.... like, awkward, writing about something I have never exprienced. I guess that doesn't make me very imaginative does it?   ......oh well...  Have I ever told you about my philosophy of 'oh well'? No? Well then... I'll start at the beginning.   I adopted my philosophy in about 8th grade, but I have always used it throughout my lifetime. There are many variations of 'oh well's, and I employ them for many different situations.   First, there is the huffy, hurried and forceful 'oh well'.  ~This one gets the most use when I am in a fight with my sister or a friend, and it basically arrives when I just want to stop talking about a certain topic.  Next, there is the realization 'oh well'.  ~When I recieve news that makes me change my mind, or peaks my curiousity, do not be suprised if this type of 'oh well' springs from my lips.  The I-don't-give-a-damn 'oh well' is the one most often in rotation, however. ~All of the 'oh well's have the underlying central theme of not caring, and this one pretty much sums it up.  There are many more species of 'oh well's covering the globe.... maybe in China, swimming in egg drop soup, perhaps ice fishing with eskimos in Alaska, getting a tan in West Palm Beach, or even going for a ferris wheel ride in London.....wherever....the next time you hear an 'oh well', think of me and my faithful philosophy.    I just read this entry over. All I can say is this:   Am I so lame that I have to resort to writing about my imanginary philosophies?  I guess so.         .......oh well....
