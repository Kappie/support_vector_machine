It was more or less a disaster but if u wanna know that story you can ask me.Despite that i still like him. Ya know what i love this blogger. Here its only about me and only my feelings count. I think everybody needs a place like that. I think im gonna watch gothika here a little bit. cuz i rollerbladed for about 30 minutes at full speed. It was fun after the sitting and watching shane and shawn and cam skate for like 4 hours maybe even more. What i got home at like quarter to 2 and went outside after about 15 minutes, was out for like 45 minutes alone until shane came and hung out with me. Hes a real cool kid. Hes never had a gf which i find hardto believe i think hes real cute. But i dont think i would date him cuz i need someone a little more mature and not in it for the sex. Ya know? Not that i would hav sex with him cuz i wouldnt. But ya know "the perks" of a relationship. Thats not me at all. I want someone to care about my feelings and well being more than "getting some" I think that most guys want that too, once theyre ready for a relationship. We're all human right everyone wants someone who loves them.So if everyone wants it why is it so damn hard to find......
