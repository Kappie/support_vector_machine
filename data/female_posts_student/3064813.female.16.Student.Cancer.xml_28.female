I have... a certain amount of time which will presumably end up being about a minute before the bell rings and I have to run off to class BRIGHT RED!  This will, unusually, not be because I am blushing bright red from complete and total embarrassment, but will instead be due to the pretty cool sunburn I am now sporting.  I know I've been complaining about it for the last few posts, but when something is on one's mind so totally.... I am a whiny baby, and someone probably ought to shoot me because I am irritating.  Hmm I don't think that would end up being very good, becuase, you know: dead.  As in, not living, and incapable of doing cool things like, oh I dunno.  Try sucking in a breath?  Anyways, I really SHOULD be going because that was the two minute bell but I REALLY do not want to use my energy for such a BAD THING.  Okay, leaving now.
