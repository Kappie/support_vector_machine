Cguro nga di tayo para sa isa't isa...  Sayang naman ang pag-ibig na ibinuhos ko say Sayang naman ang mga panahon na ginugol ko sayo Kung maibabalik ko lang ang ating nakaraan Di na sana dadating sa ganitong kalagayan Di ko matandaan Kung ano ang huli nating pag-aalitan  Saan ba ako nagkulang, ano ba ang kasalanan? At ikaw ay biglang lumisan    A GIRL CAN DREAM  When I was a child the story would say Somebody will sweep you off your feet some day That’s what I hoped would happen with you More than you could know  Iwanted to tell you that my heart’s in your hands I prayed for the day that I would get the chance And just when I worked up the courage to try Much to my surprise  You had somebody else These feeling I kept to myself  I may never get to hold you so tight I may never get to kiss you goodnight I may never get to look deep in your eyes Or so it seemsI always will be wishing you were mine I’ll think about what could be all the time All the happiness that I could find Baby, a girl can dream  From the moment I wake up till I fall asleep I imagine you’re not with her but with me Talking and laughing sharing our dreams But it’s just a fantasy  ‘Cause you have somebody else these feelings I kept to myself  …a girl can dream it’s true and to call you my own it’s the sweetest dream I know    GOODNIGHTBUT NOT GOODBYE  When I look at your girl/boy, the stars come out And I no longer feel a doubt You're my reason why My strength to keep on trying A river in my heart that won't run dry  This love is a wish you made come true I closed my eyes and dreamed That I'd find an angel just like you  This love is a dream that came like clouds out of the blue Raindrops fill my eyes Goodnight but not goodbye  When I think of how much you mean to me When you say I'm the world to youGirl/boy, it's infinite We'll never call it quits You and I are such a perfect fit  This love is a wish you made come true I closed my eyes and dreamed That I'd find an angel just like you  You're the best thing in my life And I'm gonna get it right I will be your shining knight 'cause you are my shining knight  This love is a wish you made come trueI closed my eyes and dreamed That I'd find an angel just like you  This love is a dream that came like clouds out of the blue Raindrops fill my eyes Goodnight but not goodbye
