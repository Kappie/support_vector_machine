I know this comes as a surprise to my readers that I could ever put "content" and "work" in the same sentence, in fact it came as a surprise to even me.   "Life is funny with it's twists and turns, as everyone of us sometimes learns" that's from a poem called  don't Quit  and I think its really true.  Have you ever had something really unexpected happen?  I mean something that was  absolutely   hopeless  and somehow, it all worked out in the end?  You do a double-take and think "wow, did that really work out? How did that happen?"   "Everything will work in the end, if its not working out, its not the end"  Take it from a 67 year old man in my church, for every thing there is a reason, and in the end, all of your inconveniences and troubles, turned out for the best.
