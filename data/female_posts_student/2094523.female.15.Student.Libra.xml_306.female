Lets just say this week is like my favorite week. Almost nothing bad happened, behidn teh test, the stupid knicks and knacks everything else fell in place. Who needs a bf when U can screw around with anyone without chains tied to u. Other peoples ex, other peopels bf, single guys.. screw it all! i love my life. fun times. i hope it stays that way. Well until the next shitty day. im going to take what i have and grope it.. just like they grope me. (haha.. good one)
