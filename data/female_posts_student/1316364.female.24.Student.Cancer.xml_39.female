I made a doctors appointment for next Monday and I am going to talk with my new Doctor about it. He may have to refer me to someone else, and they my suggest surgery. I have wanted to talk to Jesse about this. The thought of surgery scares me and I would make someone go with me. I just Jesse was home to talk to me and make me feel better about the whole thing.   Because of Jesse's new shifts I haven't talked to hime much... It makes it very hard for me when I need to make a decision like surgery.
