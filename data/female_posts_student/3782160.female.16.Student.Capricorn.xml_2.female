i hav neways spent enormously thru out my holidays and when i sat down n realised it i was just hating myself for doing that! and now there i coz more damage to dad.That man who loves me so much works in the office for 16-18 hrs a day just to see me happy and this is what i do to him.what a way to thank him rite!!! and on top of that the maruti chap said that we will hav to pay the whole damn cost for his repairs which would sum up to another 10000 bucks.Shit dude.what did i just do?and now the worst part is that though dad dint say nething to me in the fone n obviously i was crying and stuff while talking to him-one thing that he's made very clear to me is that now for a certain period of time I WOULDNT BE ALLOWED TO DRIVE!the only thing i loved doing and gave me a lil peace n relaxation has now been taken away from me.Life just seems to be so damn PERFECT rite now.The only conclusion i draw from all this is tht god doesnt like me being all happy.So next time i will keep a control over my emotions and not get to over joyed abt things as by the end of it all...all that comes to me is sadness!!!Just wanna say sorry to dad for hurting him so much.noway did i mean to coz pain to him in neway.Just dont know what to do!this may be one of my last updates for the next few months but lets see...if life carries on the way it is at the moment i will have no option but to break rules in skool and update as the only way i get a lil relieved is by writing abt my shit life!
