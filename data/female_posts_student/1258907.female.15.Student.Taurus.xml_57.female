At first it was unbearable And now its the same I dont feel any different Just alot of blame  I think alot Day through night To talk with Dad But thats not in sight  When the day is over I'm nothing but sad I dont know what to do Without my Dad.  ((Just a thought of what it would be like if Dad dies in surgery next week. On..Friday the 13th...))
