So I can't see it, but I can type it *it's better than writing on walls!* (insider joke. i don't get it either) Anyway, did someone say something about a vegan society? My friend seems to be attached to all things vegan. Oh my GOD! A vegan pig! Here piggy piggy! Eww, I bet it's full of cabbages! Can someone... write it on the wall for me please...
