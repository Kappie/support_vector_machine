You wouldnt put up with me if I ever tried any of this.  But you continue to do so.  You yell. You scream.  Then you calm down enough just to talk bitterly at me.  You say the meanest things.  Do you understand what you're saying?  Do you understand your words make me want to slit my wrists so I can never hear you again?  Dont you fucking get it, mom?  You're the reason I'm this way.  And to think I protected you. To think I defended you.  Fuck you. Fuck you.  I dont understand.  "Youre going to have a hard life, Kristine.   Be thankful you have a roof over your head and food to eat right now.  Because you might not have it in the future."  Maybe I wont. Maybe just because of this  And all the other times this has happened   I wont. Maybe I will just finish this.  I'll end it. Then you wont have to worry anymore.  You can fucking get on with your life.  I'm sorry you adopted me. I guess you didnt get what you wanted.  Dont you wish they had a return policy on children?  Oh sorry, shes a fucking fuck up. A fucking loser.  I dont want her anymore.  Take her back. Can I have my money back?  Oh dont worry, just put it on the card.  Fuck you. Fuck you.  I'm not worth it anymore.
