Dan also decided to go to OSU after all, which is so exciting because we get to kind of embark on the adventure together, which is actually very nice to think about. WHats better than starting something new, different, and BIG, with the person closest to you, right? I am looking forward to suporting eachother through our professional educations. SOOO right now I'm trying to find a used car and a nice reasonably priced apartment near to campus. IN addition, I am trying to decide if I shoudl get my currently 4-yr old computer fixed, or just get a new desktop and shift my old components over to the new one. I'm thinking the latter choice, but its sortve expensive. OTher stuff? WEll, I have basically been hiding out in the lab for the pastmonth or two because my thesis defense is coming up soon and I needed to complete my final experiments, data analyses, and stats. THen I had to write the whole darn 40 pg paper itself, and next Tuesday I get to defend it. Before that can happen of course, I will be getting my wisdom teeth out (AAK! tomorrow morning!) Wow. thigns are moving so fast suddenly. I've got my cap and gown, my senior week tickets, and everything, and I'm even packing some thigns to send home to my house tonight with my dad, who is visiting. I am hoping that my daddy and my Dan Ye can spend some time together and get to know eachother better, since they havent had many opportunities. Hopefully when I am at OSU he will be able to get to know my family better. ANYWAY, back to work. but its nice to do some LJ for a bit. LATA!
