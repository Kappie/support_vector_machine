So if anyone is reading this and you figure out who I'm talking about, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't say anything, OK? I have had enough embarrassment in this area of my life already. A lot, in fact. Too much.  I call him 'Eddie' because he looks exactly like the character of that name from 'The Prince and Me'.  Today was a ssslllooowww day at ALCO. I would love to be able to write some scintillating stuff about what I did to further my social life before and after work, but all I did was watch MacGyver and surf the web. When I should have been reading Brave New World: Revisited, which is quite possibly the most boring thing I have ever been required to read for school. Thanks a lot, Mr. Knapp.  I made a hair appointment for tomorrow morning!!! I will get a trim, I think, and some highlights. Probably some red and some light brown, but I'll ask the stylist what she thinks. Maybe I'll let her completely redo my head. God knows I need it! :P  Aaaannd...that's about it.Sarah, here's some happy music for you:  Raindrops keep fallin' on my head   And just like the man whose feet were too big for his bed   Nothin' seems to fit!   Raindrops keep fallin on my head, they keep fallin'   So I just did me some talkin' to the sun.   And I said I didn't like the way he got things done!   Sleepin' on the job!   Oh, Raindrops keep fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'   But there's one thing I know   The blues that come tomeet me   won't defeat me!   It won't be long,   Till happiness steps up to greet me   Raindrops keep fallin' on my head   But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red!   Cryin's not for me!   No, I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'   Because I'm free   Nothin's worryin' me!
