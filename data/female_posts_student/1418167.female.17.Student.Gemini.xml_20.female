God help us all.  But I do believe it will be fun. :) And stressful.  I took senior pictures yesterday and managed to have major panic attack beforehand. I thought I looked really, really bad. Once I got into the studio though, I must say Billy Ross is a god. And made me feel beautiful. Hurrah for nice people. And hurrah for the Torrid dress which made us all laugh cause it is so very  loud . "I'm sorry... beauty makes me fog up."  My question for this post is, why must money govern almost everything that we do? I feel like my life has turned into a Mastercard commercial, where they tell the price of things and then say something such as " Spending time with an old friend... priceless ." Rawr.  But at the same time, amidst the financial woes which face us all, I am excited  beyond belief ... excited about initiation, cabaret,  Tempest ,  Cinderella ,  Dear Edwina , working the Voices of the South shows, prom, and figuring out where I am going to go for the next four years. It's amazing how everything has happened so quickly. This summer has been insane.  But good.   Must dash away to the land of the boonies. Mom put an ad in the paper about selling the goats and some lady is coming to possibly steal a few away this afternoon. I'll miss those little guys. Even the one that never stops calling. I didn't think I would miss them, but I already do. However, I have Cody and Casey to think of, and must go outside to keep them from ripping each other apart out of boredom. aeklrjgaleg  they are so CUTE!   Recommendation for the day: Look at the stars. If you wish, come out to my house and look at the stars.  They're beautiful.  Oh and get some TCBY. Yum.   "Et toi, tu auras les etoiles comme personne n'a..." - Le Petit Prince    Translation: And you, you will have the stars like no one else has. - The Little Prince      Je t'aime. Don't get too stressed out.
