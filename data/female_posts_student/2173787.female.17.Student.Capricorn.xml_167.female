If you think about it, some of your most trivial decisions are the ones that could change your life, while ones you agonize over could really have no affect.   Take for example choosing a route to get somewhere.  If you make a wrong turn or a careless lane change your life could be over in an instant, or it could continue on with nothing more than an angry beep of a horn. Other choices, like who to select as co-chairs have really very little lasting impact.  Yes I'll have to deal with the consequences if I make the wrong choice, but they are really quite insignificant in the scope of things.  There are other choices that I have to make in the coming weeks that I would rather pretend aren't there, simply because I'm afraid to make them.  Afraid of a response I wouldn't like, or worse pity.  I can sit at my computer knowing that the outcome will really have no effect on my life in the grand scheme of things, yet be immobilized by fear.  My dad always talks about how right now I should live for the future.  I have tried that, and I don't like it.  But I also know that I'm afraid to live in the present, afraid to take active steps of change, and so I continue on, living for the day when things will be different, when I will be different.  Will that day come? And if it does, will I recognize it, or continue to reach forward?
