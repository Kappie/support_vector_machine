Me n Mick have been talkin now for ::counts on fingers:: 3 months online and stuff and now I'm gonna get to see him for the first time since Notre Dame!!! He knows the hotel I'm stayin at and it was featured on "Great Hotels" (Great Show!) on the Travel channel so like, yea Samantha Brown I'm stayin there too!! LOL So yea, we are makin plans to meet up Friday night and then Saturday we are gonna walk around campus and stuff like that.. then the game, which will HOPEFULLY be an upset but I'm not really counting on it. It's okay though. Next season. Okay, I'm out. Grassy-ass for listening to this pointless banter (lol I MISS YOU CANADIANS!!!).
