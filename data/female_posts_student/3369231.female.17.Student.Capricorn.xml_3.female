Working a lot, that is the only thing I really have to keep me somewhat busy anymore.  Work makes the time go by and keep ones mind off of things. I am pretty much giving up on Mike.  If he wants to talk to me fine, if not thats cool too.  I am not going to wait around for it.   Going to hang out with Nick for a little bit before we have to go to work today...   Shear and complete boredom... wow how the time flies.
