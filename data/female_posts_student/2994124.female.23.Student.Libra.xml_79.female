After 5 hours sleep (which REALLY isn’t enough for me) I got up and went to Lizzy and James’.  I had asked if we could do something for the day, because I wanted to have stuff planned for when I returned from Canada.  And they had gone the whole way and planned a day out except I wasn’t allowed to know what we were doing or where we were going.  So we set off in the car and half an hour later we arrived at the West Midlands Safari Park!!  We spent the day seeing giraffe, elephants, lions, tigers, emus, rhinos, and lots of other bizarre creatures including a water buffalo drinking another buffalo’s pee!!  We had a picnic lunch and an ice cream. Was like being a kid on a day out – fantastic.  Thanks Lizzy and James – you are stars.  Was amazing day, but not feeling so great now.  Think I am very tired.  After 2 weeks at Spring Harvest and then Canada I think it has finally caught up with me.  The prospect of lots of assignments, and having to find a job for the summer, starting to see the lady from church again and other stuff.  Guess I just need to keep everything in perspective.  Keep searching for the grace!
