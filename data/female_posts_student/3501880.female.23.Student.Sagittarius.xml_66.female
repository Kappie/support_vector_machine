Kristin : Ewww...yeah, go to the Doctor, again!   Me : I mean, usually have freakishly large tonsils when they're not infected, but these puppies are so big, they are practically taking me for a walk!   Kristin : You should have them removed.   Me : *mocking whining* But I NEED them!   Kristin : No, they are just one of the body's ancient parts that no longer has a use.   Me  Like the the Vestigial Tail!   Kristin : Likle the Spleen!   Me : Like the Uterus!
