Ok i am going to fill everyone in on the secret lives of the appliance type objects in my house, that i have named anyway. Ok first here is a list of all the names and the item the go with:george- my comp, mike- the keyboard, fred esteban- mouse, fredrica- sewing machine, jack-printer, fran- fax machine, claudia- electric pencil sharpener. Ok so, now that you know who they are.. now of course george is insanely popular, because well he is. Jack and Fran are like really cliquey and they exlude everyone else. Well except for George(of course) Fred Esteban because Fran is madly in love with him. They went out for a while but fred e. never really liked fran and only went out with her out of pity and was secretly dating fredrica on the side. Now when fran found out about this (jack told her because he saw them sneakin around and stuff) she got so mad she dumped him imediately. This left fred e. and fredrica free to see eachother publicly. Fredrica however is very fickle and dumped him for george, who is insanely popular. Fran was still majorly pissed for being two timed, so she seduced george until he gave up fredrica for her. But george soon realized that he was really in love with claudia, the mild mannered pencil sharpener. But George had a problem, because jack was also insanely obsessed with claudia. Jack and George were constantly fighting over her. Eventually George won of course because he is insanely popular. Jack was depressed for a long time but eventually got over it, he is now dating fran, which is working out well since they had been friends for so long first. Meanwhile, mike had his eye on the now single fredrica. Unfortunately fredrica is still having a hard time getting over george, after all he is INSANELY popular. Mike is still trying to get her to go out with him. It's actually quite sweet.
