It is one thing to talk about moving forward with happiness, but it is another thing to do it and actually mean it.  This time I mean it.  I was looking through the old photos and saw that I have some old school photos of John, Michelle, Airra, Patty, JoAnn, Noreen...and this is before me and JoAnn and Noreen all became friends...so I thought that was cool.  I feel good today.  I think all those flooding memories just uplifted my spirits.  Oh here was my quote for my Baccalaureate (sorry if the messed up the spelling) "You learn the hard way who your true friends are.  Don't lose them the same way.  Learn to love yourself then loving everyone will come naturally."  (Something along those lines...)  I lost my friends the hard way, but a part of me is still convinced that they arne't so much lost....and I am relearning to love myself.  It is amazing to see some of the stupidity you possessed during high school and yet the somehow there are a very eerie insightfulness to us as well.  My life is nothing like I imagined in high school...but it is sure as hell better than anything I had ever hoped for.  I guess life has a funny way of working things out.
