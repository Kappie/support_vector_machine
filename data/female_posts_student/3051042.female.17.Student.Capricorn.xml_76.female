If Cassie only knew... damn, people really care about her. Even the girl that bitched you out in the first place prayed for you. No spite. What do you have to say now? We may not love you but we can share what love we do have...  And as for other people. Andrea and Tamika, possibly Jessi, would understand the second request. Two candles. Gently move them together. Rose Quartz. Rose petals. Rose incense.  I am so scared.
