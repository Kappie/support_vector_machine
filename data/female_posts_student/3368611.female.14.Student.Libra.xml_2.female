They are frigging  RICH . I'm talking they have Mercedes with the phone built into the dashboard so you don't have to use a cell phone and get a ticket or anything. These people are  PAID . And they  should  be. One is a dentist and the other is a lawyer... I think. They're real nice, so I don't ask for stuff when they take me to Claremont. Once, they took me to Starbucks and Barnes and Noble.   Okay, enough of the sappy stuff.. onto what happened during  gym ...  Okay, we were practicing for next week's gym test so we were jumping rope and playing around because,  let's be real , no one really listens to  Mr. Smith  like that. We ran around being lil idiots for a while and I got paired up with these two girls I didn't know so I went over and found  Shaun ,  Garry , and  Fontaine . We took turns jumping rope and jumping in and  TRYING  to play double dutch and laughing at Garry acting like a fool. Then we had to sit down while Mr. Smith told the Big Brothers Big Sisters kids to leave, so we started laughing at Shaun because his legs don't have hair and we said that he'd be in the shower shaving his legs and singing " Toxic " by Britney Spears and we just about died laughing. Then I flipped it on Garry and said that his legs were so ashy that everytime he scratches it starts to look alot like Christmas on his leg. Then Arlety scratched him so the ashyness showed and Garry got mad. Ah, the life of the young and carefree...  BEING 14 ROX MY SOX!!!!!     I haven't called Brandi since the weekend...  *sniffle*  Squeakers... if you're reading this... I MISS YOU!!!!! lol    Okay. I'll see y'all tomorrow,   God willing and the creek don't rise  ...    -SmOokie
