Don't worry about the car- it would have only been worth guilting over if you had hit it, and even then, not really.  A car is not some unfixable thing, that's why God made mechanics.  I know I wouldn't want to live forever unless there were somebody from the "early years" (that I actually liked) that was there to live it out with me.  Even then, it would be hard- seeing everyone you love die can't be too much fun.  And try explaining it to people, that would be interesting.  Heh, love the irony in this.  A month ago I wasn't sure I wanted to live until the next day and now I'm thinking about living forever. Oh well.  Jane's a smart person, so everyone should listen to her. She kicked me out of therapy, thought, but I guess that just proves her smartness.  I don't think that's a word.  Yeah, I'm currently attempting to apply to colleges, so my brain is very much fried.
