We're too stressed; we're too worried; we're already questioning our very existence and now they want us to decide how well we're going to do under  more  pressure and  more  stress.    Had a "I wish the ring had never come to me" night last night.  They're getting easier to overcome, I must say, but they still visit every once in a while.  And it's never a fun time.  The old "what should I be doing this summer?", "do I have any right to be Chair of the Media Board with my schedule?", "do I REALLY have to do moot court?", "did I make the right choice coming to law school?", "when am I going to study for finals?" questions had a party as I tried to get to sleep after avoiding the bed until after 11.    But this morning, most of them had gone.  Much of this has to do with end of the semester stuff.  And really, this round is sooo much better than the last.  At least I  know  what I'm preparing for this time and that helps a tremendous lot.  The doubts manage to creep in, however, when I look over at other's outlines many times the size of my own or when we get emails from the Oracle telling us we should be doing 2-3 practice answers  A DAY  in preparation for the big exams.    So yea, this atmosphere is not the best for figuring out the next four semesters.  But chatting with professors helps.  And finally making decisions I resisted for a few months does well to take the edge off, too.  The schedule that yesterday looked to be a punishment for stupid, idealistic, oblivious hobbits who have no idea just what they've gotten themselves involved with, today looks entirely do-able, challenging in empowering ways and maybe even a bit interesting and fun too.    I'm still taking the summer off; but had to finally let the Student Media Board go.  It was hard, but Dan held me afterward; and I immediately felt better, having decided.  Only a few hours later, another option appeared for next summer, which will make for more flexibility during my last semester.  Will still run by the new schematic by the Dean tomorrow, but at least I'll sleep easier tonight.
