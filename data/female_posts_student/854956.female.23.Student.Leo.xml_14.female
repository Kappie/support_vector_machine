I don't know WHY I've been getting so many headaches, and I'm wondering if there's anything to worry about.  Anyhow, since I felt like crap this morning, I didn't bother going to classes.  I didn't sleep very well last night because of my headache.  Now, I've gone to classes before when I had a headache and was tired, but this morning I felt like I was going to hurl.  I decided I'd do more good to pop some more aleve and take something to try and clear my sinuses (hoping that was the cause of all my headache pain).  I took all the meds... I still feel shitty.  My conclusion:  It's not sinus pressure causing the migraines.  :-(  Like I said, it sucks.  A lot.     urlLink  postCount('headache');
