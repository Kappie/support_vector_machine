There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."   (from the book,  The Notebook  by  Nicholas Sparks )   Everyone is a simple person; not known to everyone. Unless we do something great that everyone will remember and cherish. I may be a common person today, but tomorrow  in the near future  I may become someone known to man. People close to me may someday forget me. But one day, I know they'll remember me. Heroes, rich people, Presidents, Officials, etc. etc. - they are the people known in the world. They did/do things that are unforgettable and unimaginable. They are  SPECIAL . I hope, I too, would be special even just for the people around me.  We have a lot of works we can do that can simply make us popular. Even by doing the simplest things in this world, we will be well-known. If not well-known to the people, maybe by GOD we could be.
