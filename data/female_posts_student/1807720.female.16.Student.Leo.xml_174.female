It wouldn't be bad if I didn't study, but I studied like it was a matter of life and death for this test.  I want so badly to raise my Bio mark.  It's so frustrating just trying and trying.  People who don't even study score like what I score on tests.  It's not fair, not that life ever was but WHY WHY WHY?!?!?!?!  I want to major in Bio.  Can't God make me great, amazing, and talented in Bio.  Just something other than Drama, please!!!!  Sometimes I just feel like my effort goes to no where and it makes me question why I study in the first place.  It's cause of my goals and dreams, the places I want to go.  It's because I like Bio and I am going to be a Bio teacher no matter what.  The world knows I have the work ethic.  I certainly have that, it's just higher marks would be nice.  Sppp...Hear that God...I would greatly appreciate higher marks and I am doing everything possible and in my power right now to try and achieve.  I bought a shirt that says Calgary Flames on it today.  Mat and I went to the mall and got lunch then shopped.  It was really fun actually!  We tried to go out twice before and it ended bad, but today was really good.  It was calming and just really fun to have someone to do things with!  And now that I have my car it's even better and I am picking him up tomorrow!  I am also really busy and everything coming up.  Tomorrow I am getting a pedicure and it's my sisters wedding rehearsal tomorrow so I have to miss the game, but o well I will live.  Although I used to hate hockey, in fact I had NEVER watched hockey until the Vancouver vs. Calgary serious and then I got hooked.  I LOVE hockey now and the flames kick ass!!!  I love them and Jarome Iginla is like the coolest ever!  Anyways, on Friday I am getting a manicure and then we are having a cast dinner at Boston Pizza and then later we are going back to Megz house.  That will be soooooooo fun!!  Then Saturday is my sisters big day - getting married!  So in the morning we are doing our hair and make-up and we have to set up the hall and that is basically my Saturday gone.  Sunday is the opening of the gifts and when I get home I am going out with Chels.  Ok so that is my weekend!  Booked solid!  Yeah what is new - just hope there is no upcoming quizzes in Bio cause I don't really have a lot of time right now and my ultimate goal is an 80% in Bio, that is what I want.
