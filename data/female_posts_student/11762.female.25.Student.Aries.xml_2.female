I wrote this story at a time in my life when my quest for spiritual direction was beginning to resemble a fruitless search for a needle in a haystack. In the story, a young woman find solace in a dusty cathedral, the very institution that she spent years denouncing. It was a piece that would foreshadow my return to the church in the years to come.  I was a spiritual pilgrim for the span of a decade, researching and practicing a variety of religions. I attended a service at a Jewish synagogue, read Thich Nhat Hanh's  Living Buddha, Living Christ , held a full moon ritual in my living room, and attended Catholic Mass on a Sunday afternoon. In Yann Martel's  The Life of Pi , the main character, Pi, practices a multiplicity of religions and sees no conflict in his syncretism. Halfway through the book, Pi and his family are walking through town and are approached by the leaders of the local temple, church, and mosque. Each leader tells Pi that he must chose a religion to practice. He can be a devout Hindu, Christian, or Muslim, but he can not practice all three faiths at the same time. Pi remarks that all he wants to do is love God. The church leaders are speechless at the simplicity of that statement.  I love to tell people the story of my return to the church. I tell them that I am a Christian because of a conversation that I had with a Pagan. My good friend, Loria, listened to me rant on and on about my spiritual crisis until finally she told me that there was no shame in being Christian. She reminded me that there are a lot of interpretations of what it means to be a Christian, that Jesus was a profound teacher and prophet, and that a great deal of beauty remains in the Christian tradition. You just have to find a community that you feel comfortable attending. I did.  I am an Episcopalian. I am an open-minded, syncretic, goddess-loving, liberal, Celtic Christian-Buddhist. I believe that Jesus was sent to the Earth to teach and inspire humankind. I believe that Godde is both masculine and feminine and that He/She resides in every single heart that beats on this planet. I am addicted to Sufi poetry, Buddhist philosophy, and Celtic rituals. Religion, faith, is not about the rules, but what road the heart travels. If our motive in life is to love Godde, regardless of the form that being/spirit takes, then does it really matter how we go about expressing that love? My answer is no, it does not matter. Rituals, words, and theology are wonderful things until they begin to place limitations on a person's soul. In the end, what matters the most is how that person uses their faith in the world. Their actions towards other human beings are a reflection of their interpretation of Godde.  The rest is just ashes and dust.
