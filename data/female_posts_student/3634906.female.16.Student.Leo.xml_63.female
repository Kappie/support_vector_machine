I feel bad though because we went out to dinner tonight with V and dad and Kevin and Mariah and I felt bad being crabby... I guess you know I just dont feel like its going to be my birthday... I'm not even excited... and dinner was great but depressing at the same time because I mean it was me and 2 couples... being with just couples sucks... I'm lonely... I miss having someone... and at the same time I dont know who I want... grr... or maybe I do... maybe I just dont want to have to deal with relationships and love... because like I said... love is like taking it in the ass... it is... painful and uncomfortable and nothing good can come out of it... I dont know... I think that I am just moody and lonely and missing having someone here... but anyways... Veronica got me a really adorable turtle from the hospital for me... turtles are my favorite... and she also got me a $50 gift certificate for either east towne or west towne mall... yay... shopping spree... haha... what a sweetie... I felt bad being so crabby though because she rushed and came up here just for me... oh well she knows that I was having a bad day... hopefully tomorrow will be better... but I dont know... I dont even have anything planned yet let alone something fun... erp... I dont know... I'm not expecting something too spectacular because it doesnt even feel like my birthday... I mean I just hope that someone calls me to wish me a happy day because right now it seems that everyone I know is busy with their own things... I think I'm just a big baby... I know that I will have a good day... even if I am alone and bored... there's never a dull moment with me... haha... thats the biggest lie I have ever told... opps... oh well... Yes I am going to say it again... I miss Maxipants... he was in a big rush today so he only emailed me to let me know he was still alive... nother spectacular... oh well... at least I am not having to flip shit thinking that he died or something... I kind of feel like I need to vomit... is that too personal to put on here??? I doubt it... but I do feel really sick... erp... gross... I feel disgusting and I am sick of everyone trying to make me feel worse... give me a break... please... you dont need to rub it in my face any longer... let it go... obviously I dont care otherwise I would be freakin out on my own... so bug off... grr... you're all driving me mad... well       nighty night       -gabby       "Defense is paper thin... Just one touch and I'd be in too deep now to ever swim against the current... so let me slip away..."
