Weather.com gave a 70% chance of rain, but we figured we'd be able to beat the odds. As I was walking to the subway station, there was a torrential downpour in the Heights, but I still had high hopes for downtown Manhattan.   When Anita and I met up at 42nd Street and 6th Avenue (also known as Avenue of the Americas apparently), it was cloudy and starting to rain, but we decided to tough it out. During the opening act, Ari Hest (Barry Zito loves him and I love Barry Zito, so I tried to pay attention), the rain was intermittent. When Dido got on stage, it started pouring. The rain did stop every now and then, but, for the most part, everyone had their umbrellas out.   Dido finally got off the stage after what seemed like two albums worth of songs. Finally, it was John Mayer's turn to hit the stage. Well, one would think and one would like to hope. But, no. They made us wait nearly half an hour before he started to play. In the meantime, the rain continued to pour and seemed to get harder. Add the lightening and thunder to the mix and you know we had a good time.  When John Mayer finally came on stage, he only sang FOUR songs. Dido sang like fifty and John Mayer, who Anita and I pretty much came to see, sang only four. Not fair at all. Apparently, the man didn't want John Mayer to die. Oh well. At least he sang "Your Body is Wonderland." That almost made waiting in the rain worth it. The free Sony stuff sure did help, too.  I'm such a sucker for free things. Free concerts, great. Free concerts and free stuff, even better.
