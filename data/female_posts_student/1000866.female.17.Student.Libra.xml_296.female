Seriously, I was just talking to Lauren and Max and we were talking about how different this year was but how great it was. It's like....we can all trust each other, and we all really got along. It's not just Max and Conor as a group, and then Lauren, Sara, and me. It's all of us, and it rocks, and I honestly think I'll talk to them more often now. Man...
