I gutted my desk, my closet, my bathroom and my shelves...filled up like five trash bags with junk and 4 boxes with garage sale stuff...moving is gonna kill me. I wore myself out working for like 4 hours yesterday...which could explain the tight muscles in my back, now that I think about it...I've had too much time to kill with Paul in Helena and no social life beyond that (how pathetic) but i fell like I got alot accomplished so I am insanly happy. I gave myself a break today after about two hours of cleaning and watched the Life of Brian which was insanely funny and read my book for English and listened to Coldplay...which almost put me to sleep. I should invest in that CD so I can sleep at night...wow that's a really good idea..I'll look into that but right now I am tring to get myself to foucus on one thing instead of insanely multitasking. I need to get out of the mentality that if I am not doing five things at once that I am not getting anything done...yeah like I can beat my mentalities. funny. Well this appears to be going nowhere. Hum...do I have something more interesting to talk about? Yes as a matter of fact I do! I have my final written test for drivers ed tomorrow and it's THE LAST DAY! no more getting up early for me or going to school durring the summer! Wo Ho! I only have to take my driving final test on tuesday and I am completely and tottaly finished! It makes me so happy...so insanely insanely happy...now all I need is a car...
