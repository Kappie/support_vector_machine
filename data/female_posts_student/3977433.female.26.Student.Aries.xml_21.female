Certain people just don't see how they hurt me, or how they shove me aside so easily even though I only want....    nothing anymore  .  Maybe I should stop.   You've been gone so long all that you know   has been shuffled aside as you bask in the glow   of   the beautiful strangers who whisper your name   do they fill up the emptiness?    Larger than life is your fiction   In a universe made up of one   You have been drifting for so long   I know you don't want to come down
