I hope she's having a good time in France. I said some mean things last time about being glad she's gone... and I do regret that. Although admittedly since she's gone I have had better moments with Chris.... hmm. I can't remember if I mentioned that we were having a garden party for relatives... it was last sunday. I was worried I'd be stuck looking after all the kids but I wasn't in the end, plus my room is still amazingly tidy! Oh yeah, I almost forgot about my wasp sting ordeal, I have to write about that. This happened Saturday, so the day before the garden party. I woke up at 10:30am, which is strange because I normally would wake up at least an hour later, and also because I had fallen asleep much later than usual. But the reason I woke up was because I got stung. A wasp seemed to have stuunng me while I was peacefully sleeping (I didn't actually see the wasp, but I heard buzzing so I'm guessing). I would've just stayed in bed as I would usually every morning when I wake up - but it hurt more than I expected. So I got up and called my mom and ran downstairs, but I started feeling really dizzy. I collapsed onto the floor and was carried into the living room where my parents layed me down on the sofa. I finger really stung and I went really pale (except for the finger that got stung - that went bright red) as I had almost fainted (my hearing went weird and everything). I stopped feeling dizzy but then had REALLY bad stomach pains. I felt sick... and then I was sick... quite a bit actually. After this I got better with just a painful finger. Sunday night I stopped at Louise's house. I had a great time with Chris as we got some time alone... I won't go into to details abut what happened though. In fact tonight I'm going to stop over again. I can't be bothered to type cuz I wanna day dream about Chris just to annoy Louise, heehee.  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx
