Jenna and Kayle have talked to him, and so have I...but not so much as talked, as messed with him (which was great fun if I might add).   I am only writing about him because on my aim profile there is a link to this blog, so I figured he can probably (if he was ambitous enough) read it.   I have no intentions of deleting the link just because some odd little boy with too much free time might *gasp* stumble upon a diary of a girl he has never met.   If you did not know me, and you read all my entries, you would gather the impression that am a nerd. I'm not blaming you there burnsie, I would gather that same impression too.   And all I can say is this:  NERD POWER!!!  If I get good grades, have interesting, funny friends who actually know what is happening in the world (and are concerned with it), am involved in school activities, and (god forbid) have a good personality and am labeled a nerd, geek or bookworm, so be it.   So be it.  Because the truth is, if people label me a nerd, (just as I label them slackers, druggies, and sluts) I am comfortable in my position...which is more than I can say for some people. I like who I am, I like my life, and I like what I see for the future.   Nerds, preps, punks, wanna-bes, nobodys, and loners all blend in highschool oblivion when we graduate..... and until then, I'm just going to try and avoid anything I'll have to tell my high-priced shrink about when I'm 40.
