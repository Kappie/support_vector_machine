You always wonder what would have happened if u did this and if u did that ..then once u do it.. u wish u never knew.  Sometimes the eldest are not the wisest theyre the bravest. THe more you live in this world and the more you see and realize, the more ignorant you'll become. You'll be exposed to humans and since humans are nothing but ignorant beings it'll cause you to be stupid as well. As i always say humans are fucked. However those that are older than you are the bravest for they have faced each of lifes challenges. And you knwo what...thats the hardest thing to do in this world. There is always a point in your life where u wish for all to stop and you just wish you cud disappear or die. If you live it to the end ..you have my complete and fullest respect ..coz its pretty fuckin hard.
