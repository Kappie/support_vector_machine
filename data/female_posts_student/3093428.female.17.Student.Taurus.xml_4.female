It is that day today and I have no clue what's going on, and people want me to play hockey. What to do? I really don't know. The summer definitely has it's times like these, and it confuses the crap out of me, because I easily get confused. Another thing is I never have a good tow course meal. My parents leave no food in the house so I pretty much starve. Being hungry really sucks too! Especially when your waiting to find out if were going to the beach.   I guess it comes back to me being out of the loop in a way. I think. It always seems I'm the last person to know about things and I'm pretty much doing nothing all day so anyone can call me or anything. Sure, it does have to do with me being lazy and not calling people but I truly dislike phoning people. It's really weird, a Robson gene I'm guessing, because I hate calling people. I love getting phone calls,  but calling no. Yes, another weird characteristic of me.   One thing that kind of made me a little disappointed was the camp cabins. When Matt, Nick and Dyllan wrote down who they wanted in their cabin, none of them put my name in. I mean, I am the rookie, it's not like I'm going to know everyone there.   Once again, I blame my absence in Richmond. I'm not in the neighborhood so no one comes to me house and says lets go out. I'm not in Richmond so the thought of involving me sometimes slips their mind, not because they don't like me, but because I'm too far away or they just simply forget. I'm not blaming my friends, I would never do that, it's just I sit hear bored in my house with nothing else to do but talk about my boredom.   So yeah I was bored last night and I couldn't get to sleep so I thought I would practice my golf swing. I ended up breaking the ceiling fan! Ha! Oh it was funny but I think I just broke the light bulb cause I replaced it and it works again. Oh well, that's what happens when your bored...
