I just felt that I'd speak the truth in a world where no one is satisfied. Satisfaction isn't perfection...it's the lack thereof.  That's why I'm satisfied. Because my life isn't perfect. It's manic and stressful and crazy and wild and busy and insane...and it keeps me interested.  I've realized I don't really spend much time talking about my day in here. I guess that's just not me.  I can't sit here and tell you about all the events of my day.  I'd rather tell you how they affect me.  Some day, I'll probably change my views of life.  I'll probably realize that I had just been led astray by struggle. Someday I'll wake up and come to some great epiphony. But today, I'll just keep living like I am...and on through tomorrow, if God be willing.  "Suffering is clinging in an impermanant world..." That may be one of the oldest truths out there, folks. Don't count on everything to always be there...don't count on tomorrow. In the Islam faith, it's common that people state that "if God willing", they might do something, or might have tomorrow. I've been thinking about that alot, and about the previous quote from the Confucian religion, and it makes me think. Is Christianity the only religion that doesn't pay warrant to the fact that relying on what will happen or may happen is resting faith in uncertainty?  Something to ponder, crazies.
