Then Jack Sparrow was talking to me this morning, so I figured I'd better get on!     I do my best to avoid such a situation.    *stares* Don't talk about Star Wars with Teal'c? You kidding? That would be awesome, though I have to admit he could hardly know anything about it if he's seen only the movies. That's like just meeting me and not Miss V.   Somehow, I have a feeling he'd have your ass for it only if you got it from the SGC. Now, if you just happened to acquire some explosive material from, say, some rogue NID operation, I don't think anyone would mind.  OH, I know why, K: he e-mailed it in to this cool address that has my name in it. It might could supposed to be something like (Jack's screen name).scifianime@blogger.com or something...  ...No comment to Muiya.   No one is getting any money for alcohol from me unless it's Jack for some going away party for Hammond.   Sheesh! Even the proper British person can't speak proper English!!!  Yay! Go 'Beth Swann! (Hey, that's my middle name!)  "A dark cave far, far away"? DA da da da...! *breaks out into humming the Star Wars theme then changes to Weird Al's parody of "American Pie"* A long, long time ago in a galaxy far away, Nabo--    Please excuse my host's vague references to antiquated movies.     Lesse... On the issue of trading rum... Nay.    Nanei.    On the issue of drinking rum... Nein.    No!    On the issue of talking about rum on this blog... I'm rather indifferent.    No. We are all civilized beings, with the possible exception of the pirate and the demons. There is no reason for us to discuss an effective suicide method.     *Glares at Baka and K.*  Muiya: you kinda have to read it daily in order to not get lost. That and sit in at the lunch table. It helps to know everyone. Wow. I have connections!  Uh, K: Tortuga is where the rum is. Even I know that! Ah! Evil history classes!  Hey, Church. Sorry about the whole death talks, but for one, you weren't here. For two... Some of them have been dead, and well, it really can't be that bad if all your affairs are in order. It's gotta be either blackness, nothingness, in which you can't think and therefore can't care about not being able to think   or   a bright light at the end of a tunnel with general happiness. Unless your affairs aren't in order. Forgive me for the pun, but...   CHURCH.     Okay. I think I'm finally done now.
