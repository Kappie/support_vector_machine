I mean when i was at school i would always wish that i would get sick and always ended up getting sick in the holidays instead. Just my luck though. But i'm not to pissed that i am ill. Generally because i dont have to go to school ever again anyway. Well except for exams. But thats like 2 hours at the most.  I feel pretty shit. I could just be that i am ill. But i just feel shit anyway. I dont see the point in living right now. I mean no one would miss me. Or in my opinion no one would miss me. I mean my friends cant even be bothered to let me know that our plans have changed and instead just ditch me without warning. I dunno. That doesnt really matter. I just dont feel like i can control anything anymore. Not even my own life. I mean i dont control what i wanna do or where i wanna go. My friends and family do that for me. "No yoo cant go out" or "Sorry we cant be arsed doing that anymore". It really pisses me off. Take Clark as an example "Oh by the way yoor coming to alton towers"... I am?... "Yer i already paid for yoo"... Oh thanx. I mean its a nice thought and everything but what if i dont wanna go. Cos he paid i have to.   I would like some control back please!!! I think thats part of the reason i SI. Cos when i do it I am the one in control. None of my friends or family can stop me doing it cos its private. I dunno... Just me in a mood i guess.  --May--
