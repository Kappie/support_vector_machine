It appears that you pay some drunk homeless monkey to write this crap, yet for some reason I feel compelled to watch it.  However it inspires me to write a new reality T.V. show of my own...the basis of this show is poop.  That is to say the "contestant" on the show chooses their mate based on the quality, look, smell or other characteristics of the shit of those vying for her love.  I call it "Scatology Island"...can you pay me now please?  Thanks, Diva
