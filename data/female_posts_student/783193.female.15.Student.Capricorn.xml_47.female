Actually, I don't think it would even be considered a spectator sport. Well, anyway, it's everyone's first meet, but Navenus and I haven't even gone to a proper practice, because we joined yesterday, when Brewer was rambling on about meet procedures. It ended up not being too bad, or so I think now, because there were a couple of times on the all-in-the-sun course that I thought I would either die of heat exhaustion, or wrinkle up into a human prune. There was a breeze, which was nice, but really unfortunate for me, because my contact popped out and blew away! I mean, it was a matter of like, two seconds. So I ran the thing without a right contact, and I'm going to have to wear glasses for a couple of weeks. I hope the people don't take to long in the making. Ugh, it's going to drive me nuts wearing glasses everywhere. And my contacts are $250.00 per little piece of glass, too. Geez, I hope my parents don't make me pay for the silly thing. School is... a bit boring. I haven't had a good laugh in the longest while. Laughter is essential in life. Maybe I'll just die. Not really, though. Homework isn't bad, classes aren't bad, nothing is really bad. But nothing is good, either. I haven't even found my best gay-guy friend. Boo. That may be a lost cause. I've got lots and lots of homework to do, not to mention a long, refreshing shower to take, so I will see you all later, my pretties.
