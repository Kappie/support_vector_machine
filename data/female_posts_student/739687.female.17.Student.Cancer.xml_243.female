Every note is just another chance to either make something amazing of it, or completely ruin it. Once you miss more and more notes, it becomes harder to salvage the integrity of the piece. And your audience is full of skeptics and critics and composers who are sure they gave you your only opportunity, and feel they have the ability and overwhelming right to take it all away. You typically start off playing lively and attentively, mastering articulations and dynamics, and trying with all your effort to capture the essence of what has been laid in front of you. But after a while, that liveliness drones off into a monotonous stride through notes and rhythms.  You become so bored with this once wonderful piece of music, that you start missing all your accidentals, and other little unique bumps in the road. Sometimes you have the urge to simply stop playing all together. But you drudge through and eventually find yourself perking up as the style begins to change, and your interest is reinstated in the piece. And soon enough you find yourself in a grand, regal finale, and as you near the end, you kinda wish you could go back and play it again; go back and correct your mistakes, and make the most of it. But your music isn't lined with repeats, so you do your best to turn your finale into something spectacular; and if you fight your way vigorously through the end, your audience will be quite pleased.   There...stupid band got the best of me.  Thank God I'm quitting.  Well, I'm gonna go do some homework or something. Play vigorously, crazies.
