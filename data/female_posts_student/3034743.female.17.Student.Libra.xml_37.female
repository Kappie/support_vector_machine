Anyways...now that I've said a little bit about myself, I can continue blogging away. Oh...just a few words to CERTAIN people who will read this:  You know you can't hold me forever. I didn't sign up with you. I'm not a present for your friends to open.  No, I'm merely kidding. Those are some lyrics from an Elton John song....haha. I'm in a lyrical mood this evening I suppose. No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid.  Just as long as you stand, stand by me. Well, now that I am no longer afraid, we can move on! I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down. You know the one that takes you to the places. Ok, enough of this lyrical nonsense you say?!? Ok! Today was really boring, but I manged to get through it somehow. It was really nice outside, so that was good. I was able to catch some sun...but not too much or I would've burned. Damn the redhair! haha. Right now I'm talking to Alex (yes, I mentioned you in my blog that you read all the time Alex!!).....ok, back to blogging...Actually I really don't have much to say, so I think I'll be ending this before I type any more meaningless mumbo-jumbo....haha. I dunno.
