At one house it was obvious that someone was home, but nobody came to the door even though the pastor had knocked several times. Finally, the pastor took out his card and wrote "Revelations 3:20" on the back of it, and stuck it in the door.    "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and him with me."   The next day, the card turned up in the collection plate. Below the pastor's message was the notation "Genesis 3:10".    "I heard your voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself."
