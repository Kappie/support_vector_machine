Whew-- one more night to go, and then I have 3 days off (hopefully one of which I will be able to spend with Kenny). :-D   Tonight was an absolutely hideous night, but it is over with. I want to type it out, but I think it's best left as what it is: the past. I really need to stop dwelling on these petty things that really bother me. I honestly think it is my greatest flaw. Ah... Jennica in a nutshell.   Two more weeks of school, two more days of it with Heather. It's going to be weird, probably for the worse, but I'll learn to deal with it. I heard Jen Konopa got a job at the Cove as the new shot girl. I don't exactly know how I feel about that, but lets just see if Heather will tell me or just lie about another thing concerning her and Jen.
