And from knowing my sister and her friends and half of the school most peeps are not like me, ask most peeps and there idea of a good night is going out and getting drunk so that they dont remeber a thing that happened! For me thats just sad? Why bother going out at all if your not gonna remebr ne of it? I'd rather go out and have no alcohol and be with my mates all night long! Just think Andy missed his own party cause he went over the top with alcohol.  Alcohol is just another thing for the government to make money on. In fact i dont even like the taste of most alcohol the only reason ireally drink it is to fit in, if i go to a party and everyone is drink ing then i will do it or peeps say- "omg your sad, how can you not drink? your 16 not 6" I find dat quite annoying so i drink. I'm just glad im sensible not to drink to much to end up throwing all over the place! And just to let you know I'm feeling kinda stressed so if that sounds rude... Then it IS!
