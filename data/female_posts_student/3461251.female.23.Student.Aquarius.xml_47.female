I gotta be honest though, I never thought the changes would take place so fast.  But you know, it makes me wonder if thats why I'm acting so strange towards Josh.  I seem to be fine one day and then the next be double thinking about pretty much everything, anyone says to me.  I do know, that I'll never be that fat girl that becomes skinny and then all the sudden wants to sample every guy that says hello to me.  However, the thought of me ever doing that, is just icky.  I do know I need to becareful but I also know I have a long ways to go before I'm that much smaller to even have to worry about such a thing.  But I gotta admit - I love the thought of someone adoring me and accepting me NOW, but also willing to accept me later after all the hard work I've done to become healthier.  I really do think their the one that should be able to go through all the changes with me, and then enjoy the ending result of watching me do all the things I've never been able to do in the past.  The thing that gets me the most is - People thinking I'm gonna change, alot.  I mean, what right does anyone have thinking they know me and know I'll change in to some bad ass, attitude, bitch - When they've not even taken the time to get to know me as I am now?!   However, with all that being said and being 2 months out - All I know is life is going to be a roller coaster ride rather then just a fat chick watching life pass by! And that I can handle! I just need to start trusting people rather then always thinking negative.  Hopefully, in time that will happen but for now I'm gonna enjoy the ride and hope I don't hurt anyone along the way because I can't open up.
