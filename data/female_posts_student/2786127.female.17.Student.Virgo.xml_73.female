I got so used to living on the beach and eating out every meal that it began to feel like it WAS my life, and that i had never had another. My real life seemed so far away and in the past...bloody brilliant. I am fully revived! I feel good, lets see how long it can last :)   More on these matters later friends, I have things to do and people to see.
