The bad news is that it costs $189 for 6 months.  I will not go back to this place after i buy these lens. I am going to go back to the doctor i had at home. I would pay about $220 for a year there. So i will not be returning to this doctor here in Fredericton. Anyways i have to get going to class. Have a good day!
