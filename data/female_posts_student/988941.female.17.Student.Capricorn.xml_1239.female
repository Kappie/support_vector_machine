Its more a speech really, but I love it:  "Everyday a man wakes up And everyday a man tries to pour himself a cup of coffee, And take a good long hard look in the mirror. Sometimes what he sees in that mirror he doesn't like, And sometimes what he sees makes him angry,  and sometime what he sees makes him sad. Sometimes what he sees is himself And that dissapointment just gets into you and rips you out, Little be little, piece by piece.  And sometimes you can just lay down You can just play the game You can take the cards that they deal you And you can just pretend it's all over... ....BUT NOT ME"
