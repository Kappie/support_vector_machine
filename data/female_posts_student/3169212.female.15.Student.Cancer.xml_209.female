Are you all right? Maybe if you just sit down for a moment...   *Sparrow stares, wide-eyed, for a moment, his face plastered in shock and disappointment. Then he flies face-first into the ground and stays there, unable to get up.*  Sparrow? Are you okay?  Anyway, what's this about heaven going backrupt? Isn't that rather contradictive? I mean, with the whole thing about not serving two masters, you can serve either God or Money, so wouldn't there be no money in heaven?  You know, Buddha, I'm not a particular fan of yours, but for Mr. K's sake, if you need me to lend you about 573 yen with a few Greek coins thrown in....
