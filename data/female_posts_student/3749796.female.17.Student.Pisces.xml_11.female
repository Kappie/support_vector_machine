It's not that I have got nothing to write about, it's just that I dun know how to describe the feelings I have in mind.  I have just received a message from an ex- schoolmate, we may not talk a lot in school, just some "Hi" and "Bye"... But she let me know that I was there to help her when she needs me. I like this side of mine, for being able to help someone I consider a friend. On the other hand, I'm als glad that I met this kind of friends, who were there to talk to me and give me advice whenever I need them.  Sometimes life's unpredictable, we do not know what will happen to us in the next minute, so do cherish things before you...
