They are SO HOT. theyre lizs....  ::sigh:: Lately ive been so sad, poking at everything thats wrong and just thinking and thinking about it. I need a labotomy. Then my brain wouldnt make me so sad. Oh, and birth controls are making me sad, too. And i think theres something wrong with my stomach, i woke up this morning and i couldnt even move because i was in so much pain... and i just layed there cause i didnt want to wake Liz up. But lately i just feel so incredibly stupid/fat/annoying/unwanted. My mom and dad don't support anything i do, they yell at me for being "scary looking" and they yell at me because i'm not perfect in every way. And like... i'm still involved in stuff (gsa stuff mostly), ive been playing my bass a lot recently, and im getting decent grades, and because i dress stupid and wear stupid clothes doesnt mean i go beat babies with kittens.  But since im so sad, i cant really sleep... and i dont want to eat, and when i eat i feel really gross and dumb, and when i talk to people im always second-guessing things. Even with people who ive known for a while and am pretty good friends with... like Jessie and Dylan and people.  Ugh. i hate it when people spell things with an a. like... "Foreva!" "eva!"  "Nevah!"  And i hate it when people have buddy icons advertising stupid things. Like "I'm a babe!" "hot!" "sexy!" "single!" "In love!" and they have those stupid little animated people being sexy or being in love or whatever. STUPID!  I think im gonna pierce my lip this weekend.  I dont know. Anything. Sorry for this emo post, everyone. I'm going to go smoke a clove and play my acoustic guitar and whine about how nobody likes me and everyone hates me and i should just go eat worms.   ~abby
