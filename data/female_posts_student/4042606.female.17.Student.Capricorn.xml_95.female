As I was talking to her on the phone today, She explained to me that Adam's computer got hit with a virus and is going to be down until they can get it to a computer repair store. I hope it get's fixed soon so she can add to the site. So for now it is just going to be Spinner and I. The only reason Spinner has been able to post is because she has hung out at my house for the past day or so. Anyway, I hope Michelle is able to get her computer fixed.
