For one thing, the sun rose several hours ago, and my alarm never works on days when I don't have school.  Actually, sometimes it doesn't work on days that I do have school.  That can be a problem.     I didn't get up until about 11:30, mainly because I stayed up all night semi-reading a romance novel.  I seem to be pretty much addicted to those things.  My mom has actually (finally) given me permission to read them.  It sure took her long enough though.  I started sneaking them in the sixth grade (after she told me I wasn't old enough to read them) and she's caught me once since then.  She was pretty mad, but my parents are the sort that don't stay mad for long, and are actually pretty great.     I love romance and happy-endings, which you can almost guarantee with those books.  I really don't like it when things end badly.  I don't mind it if there is bad stuff in the middle, because you can be sure it will get better by the end.  Not so when something ends badly.  There is no way for it to get better then.     My former foreign exchange student, Kath, just called to say she got back to Germany safely.  We had to go to the airport very early yesterday to send her off.  It was very sad.  She had been with us for almost ten and a half months, and we could not have asked for someone better.  A couple of years older than me, we did not exactly get along as friends.  Having to live with someone is a lot different from getting to know them through school or church or sports.  In short, we became like sisters, with all the fights, arguments, and angst to go along with it.  Actually, it was not so bad.  We didn't fight that often.  It was probably harder for me to get used to having a sibling in the house though, for I've been practically an only child for most of my life.  My brother got into the Marines right out of high school, and has only been back periodically since he got out.  He doesn't live too far away, but he doesn't come to our house that much.  I believe that he doensn't think that I can carry on a conversation with him, since he's eleven years older, so he never tries to talk to me.  I'm convinced he liked me better when I couldn't barely talk at all.
