I would say you were the first to wish me a happy b-day today, but it was actually e-online who sent me a b-day greeting.  but your more important, so you win.  Yepper, I'm the big 2-3 today (why can you put "the big" in front of anything and it sounds more important, like "the big guy's coming".   big just means large, and large is another word for fat, but if one were to say "the fat guy's coming"  noone would think he's important, just fat. I don't get it *shrugs*)  I was actually thinking about that this morning, not the fat thing, but the 23 thing.  I think I'm getting old.  I can still vegly rememer 16 and I long for it.  Well, its noon and I have nothing to do, that the only sucky part about having your b-day on a weekday, everyones working.  but thats o.k....I kinda like the me time.  although Tracy Baconfat (ha, baconfat) and Erika Sausageroll (ha, sausageroll) don't work till 3 and I am still waiting for them to call me and wish me a happy b-day. Maybe I'll go outside or something, I hear outsides nice this time of year.  I want to say away from the mall, but theres this buddah I want to buy...maybe if I don't pass by sears they won't suck me in.  (for those who don't know,I work at sears, which is in the mall.  I hate my job as well.  Thus the delema) Thals, we need to hurry up and become famous, this working for a living thing is really getting on my nerves.  Hey, are we watching inu tonight or going out, or both, I'm so confused.   Well , I'm going to go do something, so be good everyone.  comments to recent postings:  I don't like posting comments one the actually page.  Then people have to go back through and find which of the posts have been commented on.  I believe this is much more efficient  Signs  - "If I bartend and make at least $50-150 per shift, averaging $125 per shift..."    -the average would be 100, you twit.  - "I've been bitten by at least 9 creatures. Or one that's hell bent on my demise."    - sorry.....that was me.   - "And I've been gaining a lot of weight. It's genetics, man. I can't fight it."    -lol....yeah....me too....whatever helps us get through the day.
