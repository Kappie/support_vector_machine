The winded carries the     Painted beauty…..  Down Down Then up And  Down  Until it is dropped or lost    By the rambunctious breeze.  There it lays.    Pounded by the rain.    Covered in snow.    Squished by a boot.  Time passes. Decay.  Spring comes     and the tree’s toes    gathers up the painted beauty’s remains  And at the fingertips a new leaf.
