This morning I was reading a little book by Max Lucado – called ‘He did this just for you’ that I read ages and ages ago – I think it is an extract from the one you bought Melanie.  Anyway it’s talking about God’s love for us is like a parent’s love for their child. And then when I was on the loo I suddenly got it.  I suddenly realised that maybe it is possible for God and other people to love me without me having to earn it.  I mean the kids I look after – I love them right – but what do they offer me? What do they do for me?  They don’t DO anything, I just love them for who they are. I love spending time with them, looking out for them, getting to know them.  And like the new baby – I think she is gorgeous, I feel love for her even though she has no personality as such yet, she offers me nothing and is utterly helpless. What is there to love?  I don’t know why I just do. So maybe this is the same for other people and me. Maybe they just love me for no reason, not because I have earned it or done anything particular to deserve it.  And the Bible says if we humans can have such love, how much more does God love us? Wow amazing thought.
