So she picked me up yesterday after she got it and we drove around.. and then went to Missi's house and she called Missi and she was like "Missi, I got into a fight w/ my parents so I walked over here.." and she came RUNNING out b/c she knew that Nicole got her license! Omgg lol It's so cool! And when she came to pick me up.. my mom took a pic of us in the car! :)  Then we went to Ben's game for a little and Frank pitched- he did very good! And then 2 other kids pitched, then we left and Missi dropped me and Nicole off @ her house b/c we wanted to run to CVS to get nail polish so we did and then got gas and it was so much fun! Then i came home...  Today I had school (ahh 2 more fucking days of this bullshit... review review review).. anyways- so i went to school then to work (soo slow today) and then Mike came over... wow today was like a perfect day between us! It was really nice- we got along really good and there was a lot of joking around :) which i love! And then we went to missi's and then when we came back 2 my house we like blasted Aerosmith- Angel, which is like our song that we always lay too and we had a REALLY nice kissss blahhh hahah byee! i'm getting too detailed!  :) 2 more full school days left..  1 month and 3 weeks and 1 day till my birthday :-/  Byeeeee
