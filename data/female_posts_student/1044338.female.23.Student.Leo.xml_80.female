It was a pretty good flick, but unfortunetly, it was not as racy as I had hoped it to be.  Damn.  It's about an older, traditional woman writer (Sarah) who goes to get away from her life in London for inspiration for her next book. She stays in her publisher's house in France and has an unexpected visitor - her publisher's daughter, Julie.  Julie is a very permiscuous and sexual person, and the movie is about the conflict between the two characters and something that goes wrong...  I recommend you guys watch it, I'd give it a 7/10. 
 
 On another note, as us girls were walking back to my car, a group of British fellows wearing Hawaiian print sarongs around their jeans asked us to join them for drinks for their friend's bday. Their accents were so cute, it was hard to say no, but we did turn them down because we had to get home to sleep! Poor guys though, partying on a Tues night on empty, dead Whyte Ave. I wonder if they found any other ladies to please....
