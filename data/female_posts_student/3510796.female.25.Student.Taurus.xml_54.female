Otherwise, I'll be forking out money for flaming cheese sometime in the near future.  My manager pulled me aside for a meeting today, to tell me that I didn't get the supervisor's job, which didn't surprise me in the least.  What did surprise me is the reason why.  He says that he's received lots of complaints from my co-workers that I'm too controlling, that I try to take authority that I don't actually have.  He even went so far as to obliquely compare me to an ex-supervisor, who got the nickname "Napoleon" for a lot more than her 4'11" stature.  Every time she'd be the manager on duty, she'd become bossy as hell and act like she owned the place.  For this, we all loathed her.  Is this the way I've been behaving at work, without even realizing I am doing it?  If this is the case, then jeez, why hasn't anyone told me about it?  I mean, just come up to me and say, "Hey, stop acting like such a dick" - I don't think I'm asking too much here.  It's not like I'm out trying to get off on a power trip or something - I'm not that kind of person, at least I've never thought I was.  But being told something like this, well, it's got me questioning just exactly what kind of person I am.  And now, all of a sudden, I'm feeling insecure at work.  Like people are smiling to my face but the whispers once I leave are really harsh.  I think, I hope, this is just me being paranoid.  And I hope I can change whatever it is about me that's made me into some kind of control freak at work, because that's the last thing I want to be.
