All I see are the effects of smoking (anything) and drinking (alcohol). Ok, drinking alcohol is only illegal for people under 21, but smoking pot is just plain illegal. So most people don't wait to be 21 to drink...oh well. But smoking, thats what I'm most against. I fear overdose, addiction, and accidents. I fear the daze, the confusion, the bad smell, and the bloodshot eyes. But most of all, I fear my present boyfriend turning into my previous one. To me, it could be simple for that to happen, and I don't want another relationship like the last one,  ever . I'm just confused. When did G change to wanting to be "bad"? Last time I checked, he was all good and that was fine by me. I mean, I've changed too so I shouldn't talk, but in the drinking/smoking way. As B said, I am way beyond my years when it comes to relationships. And I agree, Max and I went far, no doubt (but of course not all the way), and we went through a many fights and makeups. It did feel like a marriage at one point. And I finally realized, what's the point in being in a relationship like that? I'm only 16 years old! But that wasn't the only reason why I broke up with him. Max could be cruel. But then he could be so sweet. It was his way, I guess, of keeping me. But I soon realized that this wasn't like a normal high school relationship, so thats when I broke it off, and he was really upset, and mad. It was really hard, but it had to happen. Things just weren't looking good. So anyways where was I? Oh yeah. So I have experience which I didn't have the beginning of sophomore year, but I'm pretty sure G is pretty inexperienced, I don't think he's had a girlfriend since our last relationship. Oh yes, this is our second try at relationships. Its going better. Anyways, I don't drink or smoke. Huge turnoff. Whenever I think of either, I see Max's face with bloodshot eyes and he's dazed and confused. I also shiver and "disgusting" pops into my head. So, really, I hate both, which is bad for G.   well   you know you love me
