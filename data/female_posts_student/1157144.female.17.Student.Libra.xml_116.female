First off, all the good people left and left us with one senior (who isn't really that great), and handfull of sucky juniors, and a few sophmores and freshmen.  We suck balls.  I have never seen such crap.  And, the worst part all about this is that they are all playing VARSITY.  EVERYONE!  Even these sucky weiners that really should play JV and actually get a feel for the game.  For example...  Andy Goder, is no where near super, but is okay...  He is half of the number one doubles VARSITY team.  What the fuck?  And, to top this little festival of fucknuts off, the coach is a jerk.  He made me just serve for about an hour.  For those who don't know tennis...  Serving for an hour is boring and killer on the arm!  ARRGH!  I honestly had a great day today, it was super.  Then tennis just popped that little balloon of happiness.  God have mercy on me. Carlie: sorry about what happened to Marissa, I know they had been "together" for quite some time.  That does blow!  I think that maybe it is better for Marissa to not be with Dave.  We all know Dave is immature, and this action just prooves it.  Marissa deserves someone more mature, like...  Um...  Er... Maybe Jason (he's pretty stiff as a board-- I mean mature...) Note1:  For those that are in CSF, enjoy your trip to Davis.  I would like to have gone, but I get enough information on Davis from Lisa Hardy, John Hardy's sister.  And from what I have heard (I.E. from Ryan's mouth) it seems it is just going to be "a jerk-off session" in the words of my father :)  If that is in fact the case, i'd rather spend my time @ school doing--  Ah, who am I kidding, have fun without me... Note2: Are we doing anything this weekend?  I need to know, because I am getting rather booked and to be honest, there is a Jewish event that i would rather not like to go to, but I need to have an engagement that I am already committed to...  You know what I mean, it's Emilia and she is nice, but I find her rather annoying.  Just let me know.  Also, please tell me who can do stuff this weekend. Note3: I've spoken with multiple beings in this group and each of those people have mentioned a retreat...  Are we going to go do something during Spring Break?  Go camping?  Anything?  Maggie mentioned driving to Mexico and I can only speak for myself when I say that I would rather not go there.  Ryan, do you remember that story about Sarah going to Tijuana with 3 eighteen year olds?  Ha ha ha, that is some funny shit. Note4: Val, i never got to say it @ school, but the tape skirt is off the hizzle.  It's pretty sick DUST (NOW, IF ANYBODY CAN TELL ME WHAT MOVIE "DUST" IS FROM (AS IN MOVIE) THEY WILL WIN A COPY OF MY GHETTO RAP CD (HOWEVER, IF YOU ALREADY HAVE IT, YOU WILL NOT GET A NEW ONE, HE HE HE))
