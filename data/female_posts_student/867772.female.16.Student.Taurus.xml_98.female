It's not like I'll judge a guy less for having a non-disfunctional family, but one of the things I look for in someone is the capability to understand me (if that's even possible).  He'll know what if feels like, and know how much it hurts. He wont be one of those people who tells me to "just get over it, Maddie, it happened years ago".   I'll be able to talk to him about one of the most fucked up things, and he'll listen and  get it .  I mean, admit it, if the guy can do that he deserves  some  brownie points, right?
