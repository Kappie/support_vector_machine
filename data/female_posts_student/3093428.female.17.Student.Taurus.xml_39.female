People fall asleep during sermons, and english class. Jesus is at school too, but it's not always as evident, gotta look a little harder.   But luckily there is only 8 full days of classes remaining. That my friends is stinkin exciting. Hope everybody has things to do this summer. But if you don't, fear not, for something is bound to happen, and if it doesn't, then make something happen!!!
