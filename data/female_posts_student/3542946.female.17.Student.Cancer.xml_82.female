With both sides not backing down, the dispute looks like it's going to continue. I'll summarise the issues:  -Paramedics in Victoria are amongst the highest trained in the World, and deliver exceptional services statewide. -In Victoria, Paramedics are rostered to work four shifts in a row i.e Monday day, Tuesday day, Wednesday day, Thursday day, and then get four days off work.  -Paramedics are in short supply in the state, and so are forced to work in the four day break period, and also are forced to work overtime in their shifts (it is not uncommon for paramedics to be forced to work 15 hour shifts-in very stressful and time critical conditions) -Paramedics work in difficult situations,  their four day break is supposed to help lessen the stress that they face and is now being infringed on. -Paramedics requested two things from the state government 1-more Paramedics (as this is what I want to do when I finish school in two years, I hope they do increase their annual intake-many student paramedics are forced to work at isolated ambulance stations in the country for four or five years before they are ablke to transfer back to their families and friends in Melbourne) and 2-Better working conditions. They have offered to increase the number of paramedics employed, but have not improved conditions. Obviously the government cannot directly stop emergency situationns from being stressful, but they can assist with increases in pay and upholding working hours and ensuring that the ambulance service does not have to call paramedics in from their break days.   -The government did not improve conditions, they did offer a margional pay rise to the union but did not adress the other issues that the paramedics have. The union, after 6 months, decided to strike. -The union/paramedics striked in 30 differant areas, the main strike methods that they use were 1-Ignore hospital bypass (Hospitals have a limited capacity with their emergency wards ie 50 patients. When they fill the majority of them, they will advise ambulance crews to bypass their hospital and go to one that has spaces. Ambulance crews ignore this call, making already full emergency wards go into meltdown). 2-Transport ALL patients (Often, paramedics are dispatched to cases where they are able to treat the medical problem on the scene and are not required to transport the patient to hospital, ie for small lacerations that paramedics can clean and apply a bandage to- they will be transported to the emergency department) and so on. -The government and some obscure body have said that these actions would endanger lives which is BULLSHIT! Paramedics save lives daily, they don't endanger them. And surely having a tired sttressed paramedic who has worked for 15 hours before they attend an emergency that you are involved in is going to be more dangerous... -In the past, paramedics just walked off the job, with disasterous results. The state govenrmnet called on St John Ambulance, a voulentary first aid organisation of which I am a member, to be the ambulance service for a day. St John did the job well, and the paramedics union was mighty pissed off with the way things had turned out. When St John Ambulance staff called for an ambulance when they were working with the public i.e @ the football, the paramedics either refused to attend, sent too many ambulance crews and told us off for it or came too late-we were up shit creek! -The government is being tightassed about this issue that has been brewing for a while now, they need to help out!  We should all support our parramedics and emergency services statewide, they do fantastic work!
