I guess time does really pass by fast..I remember in grade 7, all the good times. We were really close friends, I could say even best friends, but I guess feelings change, and that's what's got us this far. So I'm greatful, I really am. I was able to have someone who cared about me, into someone who loved me. I feel like I am blessed. Everything was planned ahead. Destiny, Love, Life, it's all planned. We don't get to have a say, but our thoughts and our actions are what the future is going to be.   I regret something today. I know it wouldn't have made anything different, or any changes of the his mind, but I wish I got to tell him everything I ever wanted to. I'm not regretting or beating myself up because of what happened. Everything was meant to be the way it is. I think love wasn't something every person can have. However, something special that only some carry. I had it, and I lost it. I don't want to go back in the past because if I do, everything's going to be different. As much as it hurts, I can live. I have my whole life to look forward to, unless I die tomorrow because I get hit by a car, then that's a different story.   I guess what I'm trying to say, is that, my feelings won't change. Everythings a blur. But I'll know when the times right. I know when everything will be fine. I wish everything was the way I wanted it, but it's not. I'm just gonna keep on living. All I know is that, whatever path Safee or whoever takes, I know it'll be the right one. =)
