People COULD do it at home by themselves, but that kind of defeats the purpose, which is the whole social aspect.  Drinking lowers your inhibitions, making you seem more confident, fun and easy going, so people are more open, and do stupid things.  So people get together and get drunk because then they can be loud and do stupid things together, because it's just not as much fun when you are alone.  So that's why people go to parties.  And if you don't want to go to parties yourself, then why does it matter if people do it at home or at someone else's house, you don't have to see it or be around it either way if you don't want to, so who cares.  I'm not saying that it's ok to get all addicted and throw your life away, but if you're going to do it anyway, then why not do it together at a party?
