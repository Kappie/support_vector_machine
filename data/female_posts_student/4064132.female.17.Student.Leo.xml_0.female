Well most oflife is the confusing but I mean why can't this love stuff just be straight forward? I am in love. I love this dude with all my heart and he said he loved me too. But now it's all crazy. I'm learning to except we are just friends now but everytime I talk to him my heart aches. And I am crushing on this other dude. Which I never thought could happen. I always said if u love someone you couldn't look at another person like that. But I am not and it's screwy. And I don't wanna like this guy. It's just we have alot in common and at the same time we have things that make us different and would give us our time. So I'm all wacked out. I need someone to tell me what is up!
