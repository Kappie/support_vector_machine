It's called, Spell your name with band names. Special, no? Anyways, onward towards the spelling of my name with band names.   Mars Ill Everyday Sunday Grits Hammertown Anberlin New Anthem  Ok, so that wasn't easy. I had to think reallllly hard for that list. I mean, It's not exactly easy spelling my name with bands.    Anyways  I am bored. I have stuff I can do, like, plan the BBQ.. or I could work on some more web design stuff. Maybe- I could add to the "Ice Cream Truck Man" story. Hmm. Nah.  So, that's about it for this post. I'd like to note that my audio post was just a test.. and, that I don't normally sound like a dork.   Ahem.     I'll leave you with this...would a woodchuck chuck wood if he could?
