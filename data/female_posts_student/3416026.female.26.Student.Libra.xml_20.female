Beginning with full disclosure:  I love Michael Moore (and overlook his totally retarded Oscar acceptance speech).  Sometimes his voice of dissent is the only thing that gives me hope that one day things will be   urlLink better .  Many of the  urlLink reviews  say that Moore makes wild accusations, connections and assumptions.  Lots of them are probably true, but without solid evidence there is a certain lack of legitimacy...  ...which is, of course, the biggest problem with the Bush administration.  Should Moore be compelled to rise way above this?  I can't decide.   I'm no fancy New Yorker film critic, but I was impressed with Moore's methodology in "Bowling for Columbine."  I haven't seen "Farenheit" yet, but I hope it's similar.  Considering that our excutive branch is has been teetering for four years on its house of lies, it bothers me that everyone's up Moore's ass for (admittedly) a propagandistic movie.    But is he wrong?  And also, haven't we spent four years bitching about the lack of a strong voice from the left?  (Moore doesn't align himself with the Democrats, but I think saying "left" is pretty fair.)    There are lots of caveats with Moore's movies, but I believe the bottom line is that it is crucial to listen to what he has to say.  Things are just that bad, and I feel just that desperate right now.
