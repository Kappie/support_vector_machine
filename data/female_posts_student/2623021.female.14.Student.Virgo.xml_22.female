Guys need to figure somethings out. I don't understand how anyone could think that it's fine to lead someone on so much and date them, but consider to be doing things with them after they broke up, saying, "I want us to act like we are dating without the title" and then he starts seeing someone else, but it doesn't matter because I was just one of his flings. So now instead of being friends, we are now accquantences. I really couldn't care less. Haha Felicia just sent me song lyrics from a song that fit also.   Sometimes I  Need to  remember just to breathe   Sometimes I  Need you to  stay away from me   Sometimes I'm   In disbelief  I didn't know  Somehow I   Need you to go    Sometimes I  Feel like I  trusted you  too well  Sometimes I  Just  feel like screaming  at myself  Sometimes I'm   In Disbelief  I didn't know  Somehow I   Need to be alone     Don't stay    Forget our  memories   Forget our  possibilities  What  you were changing me  into  [Just give me myself back and]   Don't stay    Forget our  memories   Forget our  possibilities  Take all your  faithlessness  with you  [Just  give me myself back  and]   Don't Stay     I don't  need you anymore   I don't  want to be ignored   I don't  need one more day  Of you wasting me away  With no apologies   Alright enough venting for right now ciao!
