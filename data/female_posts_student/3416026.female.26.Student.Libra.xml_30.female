Today they broadcasted a story about blogs from Iraq by all sorts of folks like soldiers, independent journalists, and Iraqi citizens.    I like  urlLink this site  a lot. I am not quite sure who Stephanie Sinclair is, but check out her photos from Iraq. They are absolutely fantastic.  She also keeps a blog, but I'm pointing you in this direction for the photography.  By the way, the news story was delivered by a guy wearing a Polo shirt with the top button undone and some gross chest hair peeking out the top.  I am certainly not recommending  urlLink a wax job , I'm just saying: Dude, cover it up.  I can't remember his name, but he sure was no  urlLink Pat Kiernan .
