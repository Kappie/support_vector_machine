I fucked up once more. i am such a fuckup. i dont' care how other ppl see me, thats how i see myself. and stupid pointless fuckup. I hate how i'm so stupid sometimes, i hate how i drink, i hate how i tell ppl i love them when i don't, i hate how i'm so mean to ppl when i shouldn't be, I Hate Me. No, just sometimes. what i REALLY hate is when i get suicidl thoughts. I wish those would leave. i dont' think i would veen actulyl do it, but even the thought of it sounds REALLY good sometimes. i wanna do it. so bad.
