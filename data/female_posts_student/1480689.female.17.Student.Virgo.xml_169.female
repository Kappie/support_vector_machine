It's hard to tell 'Cause it was such a beautiful mess we had got into  I'm gonna overcome this paper heart and win this time And all along, I should've known that this wasn't your dream, it was mine I know you wanted me to give up this life to be Everything I was back when you had the hands my heart was in I was never good at goodbye  Can I swallow this bottle whole? So, this brain in my head  Can forget your face  When we were starting out, you believed in me without a doubt You were the finest thing to happen to a boy like me It's so much harder, now, I wanna try and tell you how There is so much love in me, even though it's hard to see I was never good at goodbye  Can I swallow this bottle whole? So, this brain in my head  Can forget your face Can I swallow this bottle whole? 'Cause I'd rather be dead Then make more mistakes  Today I couldn't stay awake Feels like i'm drowning in this firewater lake I won't be sleeping much tonight It's not the same without you lying by my side Right beside me  Can I swallow this bottle whole? So, this brain in my head  Can forget your face Can I swallow this bottle whole? 'Cause I'd rather be dead Then make more mistakes  I know you wanted me To give up my life to be Everything I am, when you're the Only thing that I can see  I'm sorry, but you're not the The only one for me  You left me, here, beside myself Left me with all the reasons I was wrong for you   that song, is beautiful. especially since its played all acoustic style  god, i have so much on my mind, THAT I WONT POST SINCE IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS.
