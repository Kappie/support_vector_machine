And knowing me I won't fall asleep til like 4 am. Ahh, I can't wait til I go back to school. Gosh, that should be fun changing my sleeping habits completely.  I'm gonna die.  I go to bed @ like 4 every night and for school I'm getting up around 5:30 so that's a big leap. God knows when I'll actually fall asleep for school. But I can function pretty well without sleep. And make up can always make a person look like they got a full ten hours of sleep.  :)  But I always thought it was funny how studies say most kids who get less than like nine hours a sleep a night do worst in school. I get likesix hours during school,seven if I'm lucky. And I'm an almost straight A student. Oh well. I guess I'm   *special.*   Hey, my mom was calling me special today. Well, my PMS and cramps have subsided. For now at least. But OMG!  I want Double Fudge Brownie ice cream SOO BAD! I was just talking to Gretchen about stuff and she said the coolest thing. "wrinkles will be ironed out soon." Ha Ha! I love ya hunni! Well, I'm off to do whatever and maybe fall asleep...night, night!
