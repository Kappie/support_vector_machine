I was more concerned about Colin foolishly leaving his condoms at home resulting in a disappointing lack of sex today.  Oh well.  It also snowed.  For about five minutes.   Buuuut it pleased the boy goon, so I suppose that's a plus.  However, I may end up walking him to school tomorrow as a result, which is a bit of a bummer. Ah well, will attempt to be a little more regular and interesting with my postings now.  Just thought I'd let you know I'm alive.
