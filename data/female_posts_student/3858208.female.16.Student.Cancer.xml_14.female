I got a "You're Fired" t-shirt, a "Bored of Education" t-shirt, a pair of jeans, some khaki cargos, and two belts. Oh, and a kick-ass ring. To be sure, all of my new things are kick-ass. I love shopping; it's like therapy! Oh, retail therapy, I bet I'm not the only one it helps. It could be a whole monopoly, all started because I love to shop. Our motto could be "Depressed? Recently been dumped? Ready to die? Follow our lead - shop!" Yessss...haha.
