Then on Saturday it was time for Amy's indoor luau and a rain-filled drive to St. Pete for Christy and Jason's housewarming party.  It was wonderful, save the 6 or so hours attempting to sleep on their schnazzy, non-pullout couch.  By Sunday afternoon we both officially needed a break (and a nap).  Bruce got two thumbs up from both Christy and Jason, so now the only test left for him to pass is Thomas, which isn't likely to happen for a while since that biotch is moving to a big city so he can get some action from hoochies with teeth...Hoochies with Teeth...sounds like redneck porn or a really really poorly named country rock band.  Thomas' opinion aside, I'm keeping this one around for a while.  Afterall, how often do I meet a guy that even Frankie can't resist?  :)
