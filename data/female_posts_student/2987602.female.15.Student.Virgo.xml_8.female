For the past 2 weekends my mom let me have rides w/ Tory but now all of the sudden my dad came home and im not allowed 2 ne more. I am SOOOO mad b/c i was allowed 2 for 2 weekends and everything went fine and i didnt have to lie to them and nothing bad happened to me, now they're not letting me. Wanna know the reason? Because he's 18, he's fuckin 18 and they think im not old enough to hang out w/ someone that old. I hate their decision b/c its so like judgemental. And its complete shit, and i havent even told 1/3 of the story all i know is im grounded next weekend and FUCK THEM, im gonna go out whether they let me or not. Idk if they dont let me go 2 cali they piss me off and it's probably best b/c if they let me go im not gonna fuckin come back
