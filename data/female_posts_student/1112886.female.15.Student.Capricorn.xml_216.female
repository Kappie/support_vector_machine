I wish she wouldn't hurt herself. It really hurts me too. I know how she feels though, I've felt the same way at times. I dislike how my life is all about pleasing others. When do I do something for myself? Ok, point out, when I'm older, I'll appreciate the education I've recieved and the hard work I've accomplished. But why do I get grief when I do something for myself. Grief as in, why must I do theatre? it disrupts peoples' schedules. Grief as in, why must I wait until 11 to wake up? The truth is it makes me feel good and I don't want to stop feeling good, because I think I know how it is to fall down hard.
