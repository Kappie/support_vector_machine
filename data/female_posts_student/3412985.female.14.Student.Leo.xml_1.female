I am one of very few people who seem to know what they want to do with their lives at the moment. I know that after completing my GCSE's, I would like to do A-Levels in 6th form, two of these being Biology and Chemistry and after these, I would like to study Marine Biology in University. I can't understand people that have no ambitions because ever since I can remember, I've always set myself goals to work towards. I also have a huge list in my head of places I want to go and things I want to try. I should try and stop myself from adding to this list because I know that I will never be able to pursue everything I want to, for obvious reasons but I can't help dreaming. The lessons I take are English, Math, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Drama, Geography, Graphic Design, German and R.S Short Course. We have our GCSE's next year and have just finished our Year 10 mocks. I'm not too worried about the exam side of things because I was very pleased with my mock results. As long as I keep working at the standard I am working at now, I should do fine and be allowed to take the subjects that I would like to at A-Level.  My Mock Exam results are as follows:-  English          - B Math             - B Biology          - B Chemistry        - B Physics          - A Drama            - A Geography        - A Graphic Design   - B German           - A R.S Short Course - A
