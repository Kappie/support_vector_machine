Everybody complained about EVERYTHING today and it seemed like everyone was in a bad mood. So yeah, then we got to the convention center and checked in, however they made so many errors in our scheduling that we were there for a couple of hours. YIKES. While we were there however, Hannah and a few others went into a room with a piano and started doing worship songs ...before long, our entire choir was in there clapping, singing the works...not long after that we had another choir join us and it was awesome, I have to go! talk to you soon, glad you're home, keep having fun, bye bye. ~BS
