AND yet to my amazement again, all this is boring me to the bones already. I no longer found the whole episode funny. Instead, I felt that my lost of interest seemed funnier.  Went shopping with my sister yesterday, got a top from Zara and a skirt from M]phosis.  I guess many things are changing, though I'm still trying to adapt to the no-computer lifestyle which as you can see, ain't really working too well. Owell.  I haven't been reading  urlLink quotes  for a long time. Used to read it daily.   Forgiveness is the healing of wounds caused by another. You choose to let go of a past wrong and no longer be hurt by it. Forgiveness is a strong move to make, like turning your shoulders sideways to walk quickly on a crowded sidewalk. It's your move.   What words of wisdom.
