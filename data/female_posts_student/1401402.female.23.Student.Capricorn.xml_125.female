I once said to myself I’d never touch that stuff and that it’s bad for you. I still don’t understand people who do it everyday, why is 4/20 so amusing for them? I mean they would smoke and smoke and smoke like there’s no tomorrow. I’ve got one thing to say, “They are outta their mind”.   Coming to realized that it takes my stress away for that moment and it makes me go crazy munching.  I’m thinking maybe I should stop eating but as people say your eyes are bigger then your stomach. Lol. Two hit could do so much to me. Mainly because after experimenting a little, I like to munch on anything and everything that I’ve got.   Here’s the funny part, I ate so much to the point where I cant stuff anything else inside, mean while I couldn’t sleep either because I was too stuff. I was actually rolling around like a lil chick that’s been feed with rice and water.
