I LOVE THAT. but i haven;t found a good place around here. we should go sometime!!!!??? i love rock climbing. i miss it alot!  jeremy. god please, just tilt my head and pour out my brain. i beg of you. I'm sick of it, yet, its one of the greatest things that makes me happy. idk. jessica has recently been giving me more amusement than him. i'm just scared of what he represents. i dont want it to be diminished. but i CAN"T have more...whats the point in doing it. YET, why NOT!? its fun. and it makes me happy. and alanah too. and i need her to be happy, b.c. shes contagious when shes spastic and happy, and only then can i be happy. PPPTTH! see its all your fault. no just kidding. but today was horible. i was pissed off at everyone for everything they did. but ppl just have to be left alone. so go ahead. im really glad that you worked out everything/most of it jennifer.  sigh.  i'll just go blast my self into eternity with the homework i havn't even started yet. does anyone have a gun i could borrow really quick? i'll return it. i promise.   making me go to church will not make me a better person. telling me to sit in a building wasting an hour of my sunday each week, just to listen to some GUY tell me about an imaginary power that governs our lives. We have to give up the pleasures in our life b.c. we owe it to him. And then we will be blessed eternally by resting in heaven a. this 'being'. its not a good start. so mother dear. give it up. i'm not ATHEIST. i prefer NON-CHRISTIAN.
