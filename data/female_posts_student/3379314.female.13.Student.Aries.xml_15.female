I'm defently going to the usher concert! i have to pay though but thats fine it onlii costs $65.  but the part that sux is i might not be able to go to my uncles soccer game. -tear-. See the game is on the 20th and the concert is on the 21st. We are going to new york on the 20th to see the game and then we are sleeping over there at a hotel so then i might not be able to get back to newtown in time to go to the concert. So ther i'm probably ganna have to skip the game. And the games are always awesome... last time me and my bro got to ride in ther travel bus! it was awesome! it would really suck if i didn't get to go! but it would really really suck if i didn't go and then my family got back in time and i would have been able to come back in time!! err!       also u know what sux We go back to school on august 31st and danbury goes back to school september 5th. AND they went into the summer way earlier then us like a week and 2 days and now there getting to go l8r. THAT SUX!
