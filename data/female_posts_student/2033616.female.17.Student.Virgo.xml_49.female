So drugged up, that he continually changes accents (yes accents, most commonly British or Ausie).  So that was a lot of fun and a lot of laughs.  I'm in a really weird mood... so i decided to wear my formal dress for a while... so that's what i'm doing now.  YAY for pretty dresses.  Tonight i'm going to go see Harvey, hooray for RHS drama.  (Le Mes, second act was awesome!! the first act left much to be desired)  AWWWWWWWWWWW... i'm in such a sentimental mood  I like being "complimented" ;-)
