Anyway, I was feeling decent last night and Rob came over.  That was fun.  We watched part of Spiderman, part of Little Nicky, and all of Iron Chef.  Not that we really paid attention or anythingbecause we kept talking about the most random stuff...  Anyway, nobody except Abby really cared about that, so I'm going to go now.
