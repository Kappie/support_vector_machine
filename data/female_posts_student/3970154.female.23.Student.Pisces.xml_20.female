I have read the same book 5 times and I still cannot understand it.I have to write a written critique based on what I have read but yet, I am stuck here running out of ideas on what to write.Wait..hang on a second, I have done this essay before *sigh* I know how to write a critque but why my mind still shallow..out of ideas??why?why can't i understand the context?why? thats one question that I cannot find the answer..=) by the way, I have been listening to this song..instead of doing my essay..          Was it something I didn't say?-98 degrees             Spending another night alone     Wondering when I'm ever gonna see you again     Thinking what I would give to get you back baby     I should have told you how I felt then     Instead I kept it to myself     I let my love go unexpressed'     Til it was too late, and you walked away          Chorus :Was it something I didn't say     When I didn't say I love you     Was it words that you've never heard     All those words I should have told you     All those times, all those nights     When I had the chance to     Was it something I didn't say     Always assumed that you'd be there     Couldn't foresee the day that you'd ever be leaving me     How could I let my world slip through my hands baby     I took for granted that you knew     All the love I had for youI guess you never had a clue'     Til it was too late, you walked away          [Chorus]All the words were in my heart, they went unspoken     Baby now my silent heart, is a heart that's broken     Shoulda let you know you're the one I needed near me     But I never let you hear me     [Chorus]
