I promise I am not  that  obsessed with TV, though I  have  been known to, on occasion, get that caught up in one of my favorite shows.  b.) I probably average about 10-15 miles a day on my bike, so I  am  active. I like to frequent a local park that has a concrete oval around it. I usually try to bike around for about 5 miles then layout in the sun catching up on the reading I have to do for my Utah History class.  (Although I am American Indian and have a great complexion, I subconsciously feel the need to surpass the seemingly BLACK fake-n-bakes around here with my own gorgeous tan . . .)   c.) More often than not, I spend a lot of time sending out resumes on the internet, chatting on the phone, readingor doing homework.    SO . . .  I swear I am not some 500lb individual who does nothing but watch TV. (Most of you know that anyway, so I am not sure why the clarification.)   Also, In regards to the comments I have received: 1.) Yes, I do know and   LOVE   Elucid, aka Erick. How can I  NOT  love the next best thing I have to a nephew?;)  2.)No, I have not seen  Orgasmo , though I have heard lots about it and I think it is probably hilarious.
