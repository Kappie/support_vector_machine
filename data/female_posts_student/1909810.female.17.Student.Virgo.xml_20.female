I made someone happy. I love that.  I've decided to be a more cheerful person, and I've got no reason not to be.  I know it may take some time but I can handle that.  I realized today no one likes to be around depressing people, and it's not a fair thing to bring everyone else down :P I sound corny and cheesy but I don't care, it's always OK to do that sometimes.  Things are only going to be as good as I make them, and I don't always want to look back on my highschool experience as a shitty black hole of self pity.  That does not mean I'm going to be increasing my school spirit, just increasing my outlook on life a bit.  I realize everyone has their bad days, and even if I do succeed at becoming a little more positive I'll have my bad days too...but I'm just sick of having that feeling  every  day.  I don't think I need medication, I can do it by myself (for the most part).  Woo..exciting...enough of that.  Anyways, I do have things to complain about, and it's always good not to keep those things bottled up :P Being attracted to a boy-crazy girl is no good, it sucks. But what can I say, I've never been in a position where a relationship would work, but I'm not going to worry too much about that right now, I have time.   I'm quite proud of a drawing I did at school today, it was originally on lined paper so I edited it a bit with my computer knowledge so it's not best of quality...but I like it, she has no face, and that thing coming out of her head is an ear :P she's holding out a peace sign if you don't get it...and if you think it's ugly...oh well..because I don't really need anyone raining on my parade right now :)  >>  urlLink click for image
