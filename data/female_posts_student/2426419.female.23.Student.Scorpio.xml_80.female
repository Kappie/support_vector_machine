I had a pretty good thanksgiving I guess, fairly normal for the most part.  I don't know what it is but I just don't seem to enjoy going home that much anymore, I guess I have finally realized that I have my own life and going home is not really going home anymore, I would rather be here in Stillwater, it just feels better.  You know I have been debating whether or not to go ahead and take the LSAT (the exam to get into law school for those of you who are not familiar), but I just don't know really what I want to do.  I have been in school for so long I am just looking for the quickest way out I guess.  I could get through law school in about 3 years at the most, and a PHD would take another 4 or 5 so I am just not sure.  I mean I really love philosophy and to have a career in it would be nice, but I don't know if that is the best option right now.  Law would of course be a good career and I think I could use all of my philosophy training, so my entire life up untill this point would not be a complete waste I guess, but still it seems that if I do law then some of it would have been without much use.  Also there is this conflicting issue that I have been so much against xistians being involved in the government and I know that many times law leads to government jobs, so I am just a little confused.  I know that it doesn't necessarily lead to that but it can and I am not really sure how I feel about that.  I think also is the idea that I could be financially stable for one time in my life, I know that is not supposed to be the deciding factor of life decisions but I think it has to be at least brought up, because of the way america works right now.  As much as we might not like it that is how it works, and I guess we have to realize that. (That is the pragmatist coming out in me) I have talked to a number of people about law school and they all say it sucks badly, but I really think I could get through it, I mean writing 30 page papers in every class for the last 5 or 6 years hasn't been the most enjoyable time of my life.  Okay going to get out of here, feel free to post some responses if you would like, any input would be greatly appreciated.
