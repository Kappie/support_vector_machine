Nah I don't know but maybe going on the Jackass website will give me some inspiration! Hmm what about the fun party game of 'who can jump the active volcano'? or 'lets find out if dogs really do bite' (that's a bad mental reference to a saying i can't quite remember but figured i'd throw in anyway) No really what are we going to do? Any good party films? Er... I don't think 'Drinking Milk is Evil and Soya Rules The World' got that good reviews. (you know who you are :P) I'll go rent a crap one that involves vegetables and plywood... *in a non dodgey way* - just incase you were thinking of suing me.
