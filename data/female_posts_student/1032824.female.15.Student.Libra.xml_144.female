Made my trip down to Police Academy (Tracom) with Jeff and made a new friend from ACS(I), Harry. Met another guy from RV who was my group member in the Adventure training camp last year. Solaris! :) Saw the Tanglin kids and Sir Faizal, Diyanah and XY from JinTai and several others.   The briefings and balloting lasted for a few hours and everyone was bored stiff. We left the place at 1pm+. Yayness! Jeff treat me to a taxi ride sia, haha, and took me to Clementi where I met Geets and Jiax. We headed to town for lunch at Yuki and Yaki or whatever it is called. Talked... and talked... and we saw Eileen! Bought our Valentines Day gifts for all our guy and gal pals before heading home. :) Woooot. I bought this really hee-uge mug with a black+pink carton-like packaging for Brian which totally kick-butt!! I hope he likes it. He told me that he had already bought me a Black eyed peas album. *Awww.. now it won't be a surprise anymore! Haha. But it's okay la. *Sighs* I don't know what to get for Jeremy and Zavier (aka weihoong -.-"). I'm getting all the girls little pressies and I don't know if I'm supposed to get Qingrui one too. I think I would have to.   It is indeed weird sitting behind now. Maybe I'll get used to it in a while.
