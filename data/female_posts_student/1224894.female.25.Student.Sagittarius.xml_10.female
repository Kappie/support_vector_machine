Anyway, update...I found my new love. He's a person who plays the piano, who sings really good...and he also plays the drums really well. When he performed i was really awed...and it was instantly love at first chord! He's definitely a hunk...and who has a voice that could rock... He's Josh Groban.  When i get to the States, i'll definitely watch his shows.   Well, as i have promised, i'll be back to blogging. Although there's really not much to talk about, except, prices are high here in Nasipit. We just celebrated our fiesta last September and although the weather was hot, it was fun since most of my highschool friends from Cebu came home.  And a couple of my barkadas got hitched while they were in Cebu, (they also, told me that they got hitched with only 2 thou...hmmm...) So, it gave me this crazy idea of getting hitched in Cebu.  Tsk...tsk...what else? Oh yeah, a friend of mine from Chicago visited the Philippines for business, and we would have met if my Mom didn't hesitate, but, what could i expect, she was kinda being her true self...  Anyway, i would have love to meet him someday and i know it might be soon...so i'll be crossing my fingers for that!  And yeah, in December, i'll be in Manila.
