Of course, I will try my best to move on. So far no one knows about the break-up excluding my mother, best friend Talley, and whoever Lucas told. I at least know he told his mother and his sister Rachel overheard. Anyway, I'm still uber upset. I'm not sure how long it will take for me to get over it. Oh well, it's in the works.
