From Krys running across the interstate to get change for the tollbooth, to seeing people I haven't seen since I graduated college. LeGrand was definitely shocked to see us. I meet a fiance and apologized to Willy. Danced front and center at Lucky and rode a pedicab, twice. Buttermilk pancakes at Kirby and Rocha's homecooking. Finally crashed around 6 in the morning. Up at 9, and a three hour drive became 4 1/2 hours.  in that 4 hours I had plenty of time to think about the crazy stuff Krys and I somehow pull off. We somehow always manage to put our selves in positions that could be potentially disastrous, not to mention life threatening. From junkies sleeping on the floor, to getting invited to different musicians places. I am pretty much willing to try anything, at least once.  Man do we have some good stories.  Now I just have to decide between a party in Houston tomorrow night, or a wedding in Dallas. I'm leaning towards the party.
