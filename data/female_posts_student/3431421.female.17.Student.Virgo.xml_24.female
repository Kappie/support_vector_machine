Nigel said he had never heard me say that...he also said that he thought I was dying. My friend Stacey once logged into MSN and IMed me and told me I had died. X_x    Odd, odd people. Perhaps I was dying...or perhaps I died...or what if I'm still dying and this happiness is just fake...who knows for sure...will I ever truely be happy?  Ihaven't decided yet, ask me again in a month if I live that long.
