The sex thing: because it's mucked up, like all the other 16/18 laws.  Right, remember the Music Video thing? Well there is now a Web site for it at  urlLink www.snooboo.com/musicvideo . This is mainly directed at Paul, but everybody else is welcome to make suggestions and things.  snooboo.com Forum as well as a lot of other snooboo.com things all got mucked up while I was away, which isn't much fun.  Anywho, back to blogging; I found this on CNN:  urlLink Strangest taxes . This one is the best: Illegal drug tax: At least 11 states, including Alabama, North Carolina and Nevada, tax people who possess illegal drugs. Usually, though, you have to be in possession of a minimum quantity (for example, over 42.5 grams of marijuana in North Carolina) to be subject to the tax.  But no need to wait for the police to cuff you before you cough up the cash. In North Carolina, for instance, when you acquire an illegal drug (or even "moonshine"), you can go to the Department of Revenue and pay your tax, in exchange for which you'll receive stamps to affix to your illegal substance. The stamps serve as evidence you paid the tax on the illegal product.  Don't worry that you might get in trouble for admitting you have enough drugs to fuel a rave party for years. You needn't provide any identification to get the stamps and it's illegal for revenue employees to rat you out.  Still, according to North Carolina's department charged with collecting the unauthorized substance tax, only 77 folks have voluntarily come forward since 1990. Most of them are thought to be stamp collectors. (Or perhaps they were just high?)  The majority of the $78.3 million the state has collected thus far has come from those who got busted and were found without stamps.  But even if they had had stamps, it's not like their legal troubles would be over. "Purchasing stamps only fulfills your civil unauthorized substance tax obligation," according to the N.C. DOR Web site. Only in the strange land that we call America.
