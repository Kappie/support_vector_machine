It's just, I really need this book called "Girl in Hyacinth Blue" by Susan Vreeland. It's my 9th grade summer reading book and guess what? I don't have it. And if I don't get it soon then I'm gonna be in scads of trouble...ugh! Somebody please help me! *sigh...poor nichi.     Kawaii Kutie     Ok. I need to pick a layout for  urlLink kawaiikutie.tk . I mean, I have so many possible layouts. Then, the html and the rest of the crap that I need to do for my site to be really good. So, yes, I have been working on it. I would put up some pics showing the so-so layouts I've made but I'm kinder lazy. hehe. But, we'll just see what happens. Ya never know. So...I gotta go cause' "Last Comic Standing" is coming on in a few. I absolutely LOVE that show! It's literally hilarious! Love ya peoples! (O.o)
