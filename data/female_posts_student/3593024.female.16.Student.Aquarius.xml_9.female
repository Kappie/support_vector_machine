I am like trying this new thing like where I am nice to like everyone and trying not to be mean b/c supposedly I am a really mean person when I dont think I am rude it is just ppl dont know how to deal with the truth but I cant change ppl I can only try to change myself for the best.  I am having a party and I decided to invite like everyone that I hang out with even ppl I hardly ever talk to.  I dont know how long this new "Nice Jessica" will last seeing as how I told keith last night that being nice is not paying off yet and he told me I had to be patience and give it time.  I DONT HAVE PATIENCE.  But I am going to try really hard.  I went out to eat with Jen Patty and Sarah last night it was pretty fun I guess you could say it was "HOT" waiter night last night b/c they were extremely hot.  Today I went to go get some groceries it was kinda kool feeling like i was an adult, but I dont want to grow up yet.  I drove by the firework stand that Keith was suppose to be working at so I could invite him and Ashley to the party but when Sarah and I drove by we saw them swimming and I dont think that is working but what can you do I wish I could get payed for doing absolutely nothing.  I miss all my friends.  I really just cant wait till Sarah and I go to Padre b/c I think I need to get away for a little while b/c everything here is like a reminder of what I had and dont have anymore and wish I did have.  I really wish I could move to a different school b/c I want to like start over and if I could start over it would be great b/c no one would know what you were like before and they would just want to get to know you but I dont know that it would be all that great b/c I am not the kind of person who just goes up to ppl and start talking to them.  i wish I was more like that but what can you do I get too nervous, and when I do get nervous I just ramble on about God knows what.  I really hope everyone comes to my house for my party it should be pretty kool.  Sarah and I were going to go to ppls houses today to give them directions to my new home but no one was home so that was pointless.  Well I guess that is all for now and I hope that my computer will be put up soon so I dont have to wait till I come to my other home(Sarahs house) to write on here and talk to everyone. Talk to you later  Jess
