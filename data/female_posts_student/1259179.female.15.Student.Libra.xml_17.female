I love my church. I can't understand why everyone doesn't have their own church.  My Pastor came over this week to cheer me up. He is so baffled about the black cloud overing over my head.  I guess God is trying to send me a message but I am unclear what that message is...  We'll see...  Anyways, about   Bruce Springsteen   What a concert, great seats, could of spit on him ( if I wanted toooooo ).  My arms are killing me from my crutchs and my foot is now blue, but worth it...  I have no more voice and my hands are hurting from all the clapping. I don't remember ever feeling like this when I was younger and what about these tiny seats...  my behind will also have some bruise because of them... yerkkkkk..   Mark (my friend Lori whol is very pregnant and hates Springsteen) and I, enjoyed our date.  So for now I will go night night and speak to you later so...........Be Good and God Bless
