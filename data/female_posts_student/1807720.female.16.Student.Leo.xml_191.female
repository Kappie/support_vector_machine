On the road ahead  Awaiting us is one grand course To where it directs I do not know As though we chose to go our ways What does this opportunity hold?  Cannot judge, nor calculate Where we will be in time Our position in life may be standing Or running against the hands of time   Where then I may find myself Slightly short of being blind To come across myself without a clue With only a insignificant sight in mind 	 These ambitions, these visions of reality They are not undetectable to the human eye Nor imaginable, just complicated to observe At times they are not easy to believe   One day we will stumble onto a path A route that lies further on The one we have bee waiting for With stones, rocks, and pebbles too  We may stagger, we may fall Trip over an obstacle or take off instead of fall Though we do not know what awaits us tomorrow Today we will follow the road ahead  ~By Vanessa     I also over-heard something today.  I don't know if I was supposed to know or anything, but my mom was talking about one of my cousins.  One of the sons of my Dad's brother and his EX-wife.  Well this cousin she was talking about is a years older than me and I found out that he has problems with learning and has a confirmed learning disability.  This is kind of scary, but kind of makes sense to me.  It makes sense because I think I have one to, it's just that no one thinks so.  They don't live my life though, so I don't know how anyone can speak on behalf of me.  Yes, I pass my classes.  Yes, I put in a lot of effort.  Yes, sometimes I can score good marks, but I also fail just as much as I pass.  I think one of the biggest eye openers was Drivers Ed.  That was one of the most difficult things learning.  I mean I REALLY tried to pass drivers ed, but I failed.  I don't think too many people fail, but I am sure that if I did, then others must have to.  I say that I think I might have one though by the unseen struggles I have with math and chem especially, and some aspects of Biology.  Like reading and interpreting graphs, reading comp for English, understanding what math word probs are asking and determining which methods to use, oh there is so much, and I listed more things (a lot more) in a previous post not to long ago.  I guess I try to hide most of my struggles.  Now that it's summer, things should be a little bit easier though.  No crying to hours at night and like almost having a heart attack from hyperventilating.  It's just now that I found out my cousin does have one, I know they run in families.  Therefore it could be possible that I might too.  Maybe I am just a slow learner though.  I don't really want to believe that, but it could be true.  That doesn't however explain why I fail sometimes, pass other times, and sometimes no matter what just don't understand.  My life is so confusing and the world is equally confusing.
