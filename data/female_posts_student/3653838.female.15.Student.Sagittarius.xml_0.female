This means I'm exceptionally good at discovering quick solutions to problems, especially ones that involve math or logic. I'm also resourceful and able to think on my feet.   Crap right? For those who knows me well enough will noe that tis description is juz crap. Should not waste my time even to take this test!  Happy day for me , went out wif Marlina to Orchard Road and jalan jalan ,from noon to night ,so fun!!!And somemore talk about lots of things eg. "someone", alvin,eric,andrew... Hehe, tell u a secret , guess wat's my first impression of alvin? cute and childish but after talking to Marlina bout alvin, i find him a sweet guy, hope to find a bro like alvin...  But come home , went to see "someone's" blog , then totally break down, totally have no idea to choose which suitable words to describe my feelings now!!! haiz Sorry hor, very longwinded and naggy right but i just needed someplace where i can juz pour out all my troubles!  Haha those who truly knows me well enough should noe who is the someone right?
