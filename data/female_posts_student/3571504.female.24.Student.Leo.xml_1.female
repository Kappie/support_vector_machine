Turkey meat is 99% fat free I put cheese and salsa on my taco I had a bowl of cereal for breakfast one cup of La Creme vanilla yogurt. 2 diet cokes 2 waters  I did freaking good if you ask me and I still ate good foods.   I went to Walmart with Tina and we bought "Pilates for Dummies" Tina was too fond of it I could tell, but I liked it.  I think it would be better if I did the pilates and then walked for a bit afterward.  I was thinking of getting this tape called "Yoga Booty."   Obviously, it assists you in the booty area.  Which I need a lot of help with.  I have enough butts to give everyone in my neighborhood a booty like JLo.    I would rant more but I am fairly tired and a certain book is calling my name.
