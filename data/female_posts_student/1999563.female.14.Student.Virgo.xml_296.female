I already ate my lunch and lunch hasn't started :) I probably wont be able to update until tomorrow because today after school is done I go right to voice lessons, then right to CYT, then piano and I wont be home till 8!! Then I have a TON of homework. YUCK!!!  Hmm...ooh Mandy!! I have Aarons broken heart. Hahha. I am going to send it to you in the mail.  I wanna see you so bad, I hope we get to go down there for spring break. That would be SOOOOO much fun!!!  Well, 3 mminutes till lunch!  Later gators!  Laura
