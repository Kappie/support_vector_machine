Right now I'm talking to Jon and listening to cd 1 of the 2003 vans warped tour cd. Almost everyone has an away message up. Whats up with that?  Song: Life, is floating fast away. But I look, your head is turned away.   From the moment you left I knew that something wasn't right. But the feeling inside has kept me up all night.    You and me are like one heart-beat.   So slice open my veins. And let, the romance bleed away.  Back into I thought I knew, these words inside me, tell me what to do. My heart held, in the palm of your hand. (Forget my name)Now I know, the way to go, this place inside my demented mind. (Forget my name)You saw me bleeding on the bathroom floor. (Forget my name)This time in silence, this time I win. -Bloody Romance- Senses Fail
