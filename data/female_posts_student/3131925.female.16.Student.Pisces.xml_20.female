ARE. NOT. BLACK!) so yeah anywho, carlye finally went back home after days and days of partying, it was fun. that guy lance from paintball wont stop stalking me, he calls me on 3 different numbers now and realized he can text to..need a new phone and number or somethin.OH so yeah yesterday i went to mc donalds cause I'm cool like that and i was just startin to go over the bridge and these guys in thsi durango or somethin kept tryin to talk to me but ya know..windows are tinted and THEY themselves don't even realize that lol and i have my sunglasses on so they can't even tell i'm looking at them so they swerved a lil closer to get my attention, so i looked over, laughed, and sped up behind this shitty car at a red light and i realize this huge red truck like tailgatin me and then they go next to me in the next lane and i look over and this chick driving is giving me a dirty look and they guys like flippin out at me yet..both of our windows are up and my music is kinda loud, so i looked up to the shitty car again and turned my music even louder. light turns green the car infront of them speeds up but noooo they have to drive right along side of me, i didnt even bother to look but at the corner of my eye i could see the red car. so i'm almost home and i'm still behind this piece of shit car lol but no ones infront of them yet they stop next to me yet AGAIN, so once the light turned green the piece of shit car went over into their lane and i sped up like 90 and they stayed behind...for a good 5 seconds then they came into my lane and zoomed up to me and i slowed down a lot and right when i was about to turn and they were behind me i flipped them off and they honked as they went by. i STILL don't know what i could have done to even piss them off that damn bad but w/e....people just hate me cause i'm drivin a mercedes benz and their ass is stuck in a piece of shit like the one i had to follow practically all the way home HA! oh yeah and nice "get together at clint's house on sat" his mom's gonna be out at her bfs..VOPOP!!
