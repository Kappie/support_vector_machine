Today is built on tragedies, which no one wants to face. Nightmares to humanity and morally disgraced. Tonight is filled with rage, violence in the air. Children bred with ruthlessness, cause no one at home cares. Tonight I lay my head down, but the pressure never stops. Knowing that my sanity, content when I'm dropped. But tomorrow I see change, a chance to build a new. Build on spirit intent of heart and ideas based on truth. Tomorrow I wake with second wind and strong because of pride. I know I fought with all my heart to keep the dream alive.
