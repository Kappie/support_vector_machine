I safely saw my travelling companions off on our flight (it was overbooked -- I did not make the flight)..... so, I had to choose between travel to another Honduran city, travel to Guademala or several day's delay. I choose to travel to another Honduran city which will only cause a mild layover and a slightly longer bus ride to my final destination. All in all I will be about one day late rather than several. I have not heard good things about the bus ride from Guademala and the several bus transfers required to get to my little town in Honduras....and my spanish is barely adequate....so I opted to travel to the Capitol of the country and travel on a single bus ride. Will report more as time permits. I will say....I have married twice and was late to both weddings. I had hoped that I had outrun the luck of the Irish, but alas.... she follows...LOL Hasta! Evelyn
