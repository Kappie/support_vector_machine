I just feel weak and tired and lonely. All I want is for them to let me sleep. But no. They give me chores, tell me i will be grounded if i don't do them, and then they leave. all i want to do is throw myself out the window, but knowing my luck, i'll survive with a bruise or two and then everyone i know will stop trusting me because i am psycho.  i suppose that is iniciative enough.  and as I go through this today, I realize I have no one to call. No one would even listen for two seconds.  I HATE being lonely. I hope this gets over really really soon.
