The going over of syllabi was somewhat more lengthy than in undergrad but still, we didn't do a whole lot in either class and got out early from Stats (thank God, as I had to go to Walmart for school supplies and snacks).  The last fifteen minutes of stats was spent with my professor reeling off formulas that we'd need for our homework assignment and me thinking "OH MY GOD!" as I haven't been in a stats class in five years.  However, when I sat down with it last night it began sort of vaguely coming back to me, so I think it's not completely lost in the annals of my recently underworked brain.  So far I've got about 150 pages to read and one more class to attend today.  Intelligence Testing at 12:30.  So far my profs seem nice.  Armstrong is generally perky and seems like a fun loving sort of guy.  Geisen...well, he's got more personality than Ben Stein...but not much.  He seems nice though, despite the flaw of apparently loving all math related courses of study.   I had fits yesterday trying to log in to whatever the university's system is to access some of my readings.  The damn thing wouldn't take my password AGAIN.  I finally got it changed this morning to something that's a bit easier to remember.  Fewer numbers.   This morning I've been creating charts in Excel for an expansion of an old report for my boss.  Our undergrad assistant will plug the actual numbers in...once I've run them on SPSS of course. Which I must do shortly.  But I felt the urge to write here whilst I had the opportunity.   Murphy has evidently lost 12 pounds, though on a man as big and tall as he, much of it is probably water weight from actually not eating junk every day.  Damn him.  I, naturally, have lost nothing and am retaining water like a sponge or something to that effect.  I keep forgetting to buy my apple cider vinegar tablets, as they didn't have them when I went last week.  As of Monday I'm going to start trying to squeeze  workouts in my weekly routine.  And hopefully my MIL will walk with me a few nights a week.  She and I have such an odd, but good relationship.  It's really a blessing.  Especially when I hear all the tales of terrible in-laws from my various other married friends.  I'm going to start phase 1 of Southbeach seriously again today.  So far I've had my tea and a handful of peanuts.  I have some string cheese in my bag for whenever I get hungry later and when I get back from class at 2:30 I've got some low carb cup of soup that should tide me over until I get home this evening.  I bought all sorts of stuff at the grocery last night for this phase...lots of veggies, shrimp, fish, and a few other things.  This is my last weird week before settling into a true schedule.  I'll work the rest of today after class and then in the morning I'm having my phone line installed and coming in for the last 2 and a half hours I need for the week.   Then to Oxford to see Murphy.  Oh wait...I already worked my other four hours on Tuesday.  So I don't have to work on Friday...or this afternoon.    Sweet.  I can go ahead and get a jumpstart on my reading.  Probably psychopathology first.   Must work...  Yours, Maggie
