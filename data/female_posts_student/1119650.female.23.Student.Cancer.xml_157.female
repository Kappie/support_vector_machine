Singng their evil siren songs, making their dirty movies that no one watches except dirty males trying to run a batch and now they've ventured into every conceivable kind of merchandizing you can think of.  Home fashions, clothing and now bath  beauty products.  Last week I went to  urlLink Wal*Mart  and purchased a Mary-Kate and Ashley bath pouf for the shower at the gym.  Two days later I got pink eye...those evil lil vixens!    I find it interesting that on their website they've dedicated a whole page to  urlLink "plus size girls" ...these toothpick thin little wenches are trying to be socially acceptable and talk about curvy girls?  Please...go choke on your puke you bulemic lil wenches!  In their  urlLink "Hip Picks"  section the girls tell us what their favorite things are at the moment.  Look at how thoughtful little Ashley is when talking about her favorite cd ""Their Greatest Hits: The Record" by the Bee Gees -- "in memory of band member Maurice Gibb, I had to mention this album. Every sleepover should include a little classic disco, and the Bee Gees are perfect for a fun night with friends."  I don't think they could even name one single Bee Gees song...they probably only put it on their site to drive more traffic to it when people were googling "Maurice Gibb".  Promo whores!  ugh...I hate them...blech...die!
