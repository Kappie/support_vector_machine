If things go on like this—which in a way I sometimes hope they do—we will reach the point where newspapers will report exchanges deadpan, like this:   " 'Fuck off,' he shot back." " 'Fuck off,' he suggested."  " 'Fuck off,' he opined." " 'Fuck off,' he advised." " 'Fuck off,' he averred." " 'Fuck off,' he joked."  Or even, " 'Fuck off,' he quipped."   Right then. Off we fuck.
