Boo on human osteology, which is a good class but a bitch load of work. Boo on not knowing if we're going to get our permit for Montenegro. Boo on Calvin having to work a bazillion hours and never being online. Boo on being busy busy busy and falling behind on email. Boo on people who don't email me back as much as I want them to. Boo on working all the time yet never seeming to accomplish anything. And boo on phone calls not being free.
