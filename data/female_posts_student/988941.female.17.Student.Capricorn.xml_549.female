But yeah it's a really nice picture that we've got, yay! And I saw Nicki's and she looked fab, I didn't see the rest of people though! I've just got back from makros and ASDA. In makros we bought all manner of fizzy drinks and sweets for my party (including 600 marshmellows!!!), and then in ASDA we bought lots of crisps and stuff, so we now have everything we need for a party! yay! I even pursuaded mmu to buy me my own personal supply of alcopops! yay!  Anyway got to go cos my eye is giving me grief, hope maths goes okay for everyone (I'm gonna fail). Bye!
