If your partner is emotionally cold or too grasping you will feel quite on edge; Juno-Cancer's strong suit is not holding up under emotional pressure. If your partner meets your needs, however, you are extremely loving and nurturing in long-term relationships. You treat others with tenderness and care, making you much sought-after and adored. The past is very important to you; you remember anniversaries and touching occasions which you celebrate with loving remembrances. That same remembrance of the past is your downfall, however; you may remember past hurts too keenly and be reluctant to be vulnerable. Love requires that vulnerability and you'd be wise to remember the lessons you've learned from past hurts but to remember that it's important not to guard your emotions with an iron fist and to be a little less sensitive."
