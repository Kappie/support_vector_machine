The class was easy and think this class will be easy for me, let alone fun :)  Right now we are doing Microsoft Word (which I already know).  The instructor seems to be a pretty good person and funny.  Tuesday night I had Medical Law  Ethics/Therapuetic Communications. That night we went over Medical Law. This instructor is new and he is a pretty good guy. He was an officier in the Army with an MOS of 91 Bravo (civilian terms EMT). He still carries the military attitude towards keeping the class quiet and trys to crunch everything in, in one night (which that for me got a little overwhelming, but did manage to finish what he wanted done). Next week he wants to go over Therapuetic Communications. Now that book I am interested in, as he wants us to read the first chapter which I did. I skimmed through the book and this book is going to be fun for me at least :)  For the medical law part, he wants us to find an article every week either online or in newspapters etc, and write a one page summary. So I need to start doing a search for articles of that nature online. He also mentioned that if we wear our scrubs every week, he will give us 3 points and we can use that towards our mid term or final exam.  Last night was Anatomy and Pathophysiology II. This teacher is gonna be a tough one for me (here my luck with good teachers was doing good so far the whole time in school LOL). But we didn't get to stay long, as the air conditioner was out in the building, and an hour later the dean sent all of us home. We are going over blood as our first chapter. But she mentioned that she likes to make her test and quizzes challanging for fun. She made it sound like the "A" in her class will be a challange in itself :(  With me not feeling well this week, my mind went negative saying to myself, there goes my Presidents List this quarter".  But I got myself out of that negative mode and told myself that this is my true challange to prove I can get an "A" with her challange.  Tonight I have English Composition II so will see how that goes tonight. But that is how my week  has been going so far. So far got 2 easy classes and one challanging one, will find out how tonights class will go :)  TTFN!!
