Our 4th was pretty good, we chillaxed in the pool for a few hours till some pple showed up for the party my parents were throwing. We drank up kinda early, but it was ok riight? it was 4th of July. We had some jello shots before we visted Erika at her uncles house. She completley awesome, i hadnt met her before, we just only talk on the phone or what not. Yea she was straight.  emmm we stayed over there for a while         i will continue this later. . .
