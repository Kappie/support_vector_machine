Anything makes me cry...I've cried everyday this week...I guess I've just been down for various reasons. *sigh* Now I know all of you who read this are gonna say different and say you're always there to talk to n stuff I know you're there but still I dunno what it is..but something is still missing. If only you knew what it was like to live one day in my shoes...feel the pain I feel everyday. *sigh* I guess one main thing is...I really don't have a super close friend...You all have someone else. I know this may sound stupid but I get tired of keeping everything inside. Thats why im in so much pain. I have no time in the day to let my feelings out...so they stay bottled up inside. It hurts you know...it really does. None of you have any idea how many times I've cried myself to sleep in my life...because I don't have that one close friend here...None of you know how many times I've prayed my dad would find a new job...just so we could move and I could start over. None of you know...how many times...I wish my life ended. *sigh* Its a good thing I got into church and started Youth Council. If not..who knows where I'd be today. I know treasure each day I have here...well not really Hartley but just here...on earth. I just live my life looking forward to the next meeting or next trip...and if thats how I have to carry on through highschool...so be it. I can live it out...I can fake those smiles and laughs...I have for one whole year...Most of you probably don't know how many times I went to school right after a huge fight with my parents or just plain hurting...I cover it up...sometimes I just can't...Sometimes I just let it all out...like oh 2 weeks ago in algebra...I just let it out....starting crying...but it ended up alright....only Mr Wallinga and Mayu knew I still tried to hide it but yeah. I guess Im just in a down mood today for some reason...weather tends to bring me down to...thats why I swear I have that S.A.D. But I'll never know...It just brings up another fight with the parentals...so yeah. Another thing that brought me down was last night at my cousins graduation party. My cousin Brooke brought her boyfriend along and yeah...everyone had someone else that whole night...Theres just no one else my age in our family..well sure theres Cody and Scott...but they are always with each other so yeah. It just hit me that I really missed Ross alot last night. I can't wait for this summer...school problems will end and I can just be myself...not hide...and have a great time...I hope thats how it will go...but yeah im gonna go lighten up my mood and go to a movie with my little cousin Cassie. She always brings a smile to my face...so hopefully the next time I write I'll be a little bit happier...Im out.  -Tara
