Im not sure on our chance (cheh..OUR gitu) to win because Sir Alex did mention to the media that he's going to rest the senior players. Besides that, Ruud Van Nistelrooy and Solskjaer are injured. Although we have the new signing Alan Smith plus other strikers, but we dont know hows the "partnership" gonna be. Hopefully, United, again (yes again!) will win the Community Shield trophy. I know this match is not a big..um..achievement (if we win) but still..Its a great start to boost up their confidence & team spirit. We cant afford to lose anymore match after the USA tour. ( Yeah..sad! But I know they did their best )          So United, why dont you kick the Gooner's asses and remain unbeaten by Arsenal this Sunday?! Well, Best of luck and Im sure gonna give ya my full support! (bet the others will too)             GO MANCHESTER UNITED
