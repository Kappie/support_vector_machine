This comes from the greatest book of poems ever written,  Reflections on a Gift of Watermelon Pickle... , and the poem is called  Poets Hitchhiking on the Highway . Let's read, shall we?  "Of course I tried to tell him but he cranked his head  without an excuse I told him the sky chases the sun And he smiled and said, "What's the use." I was feeling like a demon again So I sad: "But the ocean chases the fish." This time he laughed  and said: "Suppose the strawberry were pushed into a mountain." After that I knew the war was on-- So we fought: He said: "The apple-cart like a broomstick-angel snaps and splinters old dutch shoes." I said: "Lightning will strike the old oak and free the fumes!" He said: "Mad street with no name." I said: "Bald killer! Bald killer! Bald killer!" He said, getting real mad, "Firestoves! Gas! Couch!" I said, only smiling, "I know God would turn back his head if I sat quietly and thought." We ended by melting away, hating the air!"  Wasn't that great? Life is really cool now.  Later, friends.
