Wonder what can be so bad  That it makes you want to die  I wonder what could be so tragic  Makes you want to take your life  You have your Savior on the cross  While you sit on the throne  Put yourself up on that cross  Put your Savior on the throne   And I know it's hard to take what's happening  And I know life is tough sometimes  And I know it seems like there's no hope for you  And I know your life is worth more than you can see   It's hard to see beyond your pain  When you feel so dead inside  It's hard to see what you've been given  It's hard to find the hope in life   And I know it's hard to take what's happening  And I know life is tough sometimes  And I know it seems like there's no hope for you  And I know your life is worth more than you can see   And I say look at Jesus' hands  Those scars are there for you  You know He understands  What you're going through  babe, He knows, let him handle it!!!
