Commissioner , and I think to myself that first party's name is silly, because "corporation" is in the title, followed by "Inc." so that the name of the company is "International Freighting Corporation, Incorporated."   Pathetic, huh?  Feel free to email me and tell me to get a life.  Or better yet, send me an instant message:  NarcissistSLB.
