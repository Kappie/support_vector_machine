First, I'm not trying to find the meaning of life. I'm pretty sure there  is  no real meaning, and we're all just sort of... here . I'm just looking for a way to make life a little more tolerable, that's all.  No, I don't believe in fate. I don't believe in any sort of plan or supreme force, actually. I think that life is just a series of coincidences--nothing happens for a reason. If we all had a predetermined destiny, what's the point in even living? That would mean that our choices didn't matter, right? But of course they do matter. I don't like the idea that we can't build our own life and future. What do you think?  Hm, this is interesting. Right now, VW and I both seem to be focusing on self-actualization. But it seems to me as though a person must return to safety/security and love/affection once they move out and begin life on their own. And I haven't yet properly fulfilled my need for esteem. I think VW is a lot further with that than I am. Right now I'm more or less ignoring the lower needs (except for the fact that I do still breathe...) and planning for self-actualization. I like doing things out of order. Even though it usually doesn't work very well. Hum.   VW wants you to comment on  urlLink her blog .
