I think I'm a pretty decent person, but maybe I'm just fooling myself. Maybe I've been fooling myself all the time. I'm never going to find someone. Never. There's not even one person who's remotely interested in me. Everyone seems to find someone, and I get to hear all about it, and...heh. Wow. I love that people trust me, and tell me stuff but...I guess, it just hurts when I realize that no one's talking about me to someone. No one likes me, has ever liked me, or will ever like me.   Right now, the glass is not just half empty, it's empty and shattered.
