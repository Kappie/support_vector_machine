We trapped it under a bowl thing...but then i wuz scared it would suffocate after leaving it under there for like...four and a half hours :P So i asked my dad to save it. Operation save bee was then carried out. And i was so scared that it wuz dead lol. It wuzn't tho *YAY* :D I think bumblebees are really cute..i'm just afraid of them. Does that make sense?? :S who carez! :D      Yes...the drama with everyone is starting to get to me...GEEEEEEEEEEZ! Calm down ppl....we'll get through this...we'll all get through this. Well...i dunno if i'll get through MY drama without a few tears in there somewhere...but it all turns out okay in the end. :P Neways..i have like nothing to say. OH YEAH! My cuzins are coming from england on friday...that should be awesome :D I'm going to the mall with jen, janice, ryan, tupac, kelly, chris and jo tomorrow. That should be awesome too.
