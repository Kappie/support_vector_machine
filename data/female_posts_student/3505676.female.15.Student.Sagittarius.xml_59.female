Not quite as fun as the first [[reminds me of how the first day of school is so fun cuz u see everyone then the second and third it just begins to fade.]] However, as i can tell by my soreness, i am getting back in shape. I need to work on hitting since i play front row..altho i dno what it will be like this time.  What if i dont play? ARGH...dont wanna start thinking about that right now.  So now that ive watched the freshies id say 3 of them are good and will get some playing time.  Depending on how many she cuts, i dno who else will be picked.  All i know is that i want to play middle hitter and that i have some competition for the spot.  oh well, itll make me push myself.  After tryouts brad came down to the gym and we talked for a little while then i left with maggie, jen, and a new tennis freshie, allison.  *or maybe she spells it my way, thatd make her awesome* Who needs two Ls in Alison?
