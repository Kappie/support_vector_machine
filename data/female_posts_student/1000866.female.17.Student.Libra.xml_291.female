So, I've got this song stuck in my head. The one from the Mary Tyler Moore show. Haha, kind of funny seeing as I haven't watched that show in so very long.  How will you make it on your own? This world is awfully big Girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving  Love is all around  No need to waste it You can never tell Why don't you take it? You might just make it after all You might just make it after all....   You know what's worst of all of this? That I know the fricking words.
