Though, after a look at some of M. Rosenbaum's publicity pictures, the guy looks much better sans hair.  Just a thought.  Other sexy villains?  I'm completely drawing a blank, but I know there are many.    It's on-call night again!  They come so frequently...  Ah, well, this is the last time I'm on call in Heme/Onc.  I go to general medicine next.  Should be interesting.    Anyway, I'm watching Smallville right now.  It's hard to follow a show that you only see once or twice a season.  I think I'd choose Lex over Clark if I lived in whatever town it is that they live in.  Ha.  Smallville.  I seriously could not figure that out for a minute...  I'm apparently more sleep-deprived than I thought.  Le sigh.  The Kents' house just exploded...?  And apparently Lex is...dropping dead?  Confusing show.  I'm waiting for American Idol to come on.  Yee-haw!  I can't wait to find out what happens.  Will Fantasia make it thru the night?  I do hope so.  I'm a reluctant fan, but I actually like Fantasia.  I'd probably buy a CD, even.  Yes.  I  will  buy a CD!  I'm being decisive.  Tom Welling.  Too attractive, yes or no?  Paperwork is calling my name.  I'm going to get ahead!
