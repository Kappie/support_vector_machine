Hehe, I got a key ring that says - Jesus loves you, every one else thinks you're an ass hole. Muhahahaaa.... that's for big ass Emma! *aww i don't mean it really! it's a running joke!* We have big butt arguments in school... totalllly normal! (For us anyway) Yup, us, I drag people into trouble by saying that a lot. Well I'm actually supposed to be with my parents so I'll go. So long and thanks for all the fish.
