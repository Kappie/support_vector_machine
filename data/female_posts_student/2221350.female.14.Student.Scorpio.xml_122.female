From  urlLink The Blog of the Century   "I once saw a television show that said the best form of birth control is abstinence. That's kind of like saying the best bullet proof vest is not getting shot at."  yeah, I know this damningly clever anecdote doesn't apply to the fully flowered dapper dear that is me, but I think it's genius.  which makes me wonder. What exactly would be the allure of my blog? Is it that I snatched up the fabulous damselindistress URL? Is it that I use the word 'mercurial' in my title, that word that you thought you'd never be able to use, but can do so when referring to my blog in the course of your life? Seeing as I don't write porn or have naked britney spears pictures or spark epiphanies, it makes me wonder.
