I'm feeling dizzy--I was just typing the response paper and I could have sworn I was levitating above the keyboard or something. Before that, I had a headache, maybe from funny smells. That happens a lot. I just don't know what to do with it, since it usually doesn't happen. I took Tylenol, but the only kind I had was the cold kind, so in addition to alleviating my throbbing in the back of my head, it's also supposed to stop coughing and something else. I don't bother to remember anymore.  Arr, this sucks. It's really something I can't control. I even tried napping, particularly unpleasant since I have a response paper and another load of anthro reading to do. That helped, maybe. I don't know what's wrong with me.  We have seventeen days left here. Wow.  Change of plans: I'm leaving SSP on Saturday, August 21 and getting home on the 24th. I think I already told you. Blame it on the headache/dizziness/whatever's going on up there.  I had to vent. It's back to the response paper.
