The follow up ‘More ABBA Gold’ did very well considering that it did not have many major hits on it and on the track list you find the hidden gem; ‘I am the City’      The previously unreleased recording ‘I am the City’ dating back to ABBA’s final recording sessions in 1982 can only hint about what ABBA’s ninth album could have been like. With the singles ‘Cassandra’, ‘The day before you Came’ and ‘Under Attack’ this song was supposed to be on the now so infamous ‘Opus 10’ album that ABBA never finished.  ‘I am the City’ has to be one of their strongest recordings ever and this almost dreamlike song gives hardcore ABBA fans, like myself, shivers down our spines, knowing that it was recorded at the very end of this great bands existence. It is also a continuation of the style developed on the 1981 album release ‘The Visitors’ and shows that ABBA was developing and exploring new musical territories.  Put ‘I am the City’ on and do not get surprised if your friends have no idea who is singing, because this track is quite different from what you are used to from this band.    urlLink The Official ABBA Site
