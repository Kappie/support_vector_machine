Anyway, I'm the one in the centre and beside me are two of my best friends, the one on the right is my "jie"~   We took this picture and wrote friends forever coz we want to stay together 4EVA~   As for the background, unfortunately we were only given 100 seconds to choose, otherwise we'd have chosen another *DUH*, but I still think it's quite nice =P...     All the red T-shirts are worn on National day in school, so we took the chance after school to go to Tampinese Mall to take this pic~   Nice? From Japan~     Anyway, yesterday was National day and I forgot to wish it a Happie Birthdae... So...   Singapore~ Happie National DAE~! Woot~!    urlLink     ©2004 LeoVYN.
