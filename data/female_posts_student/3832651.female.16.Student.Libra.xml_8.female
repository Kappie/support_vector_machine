"Are you ready to worship? Worship is not a song.  Worship is my response to God with all that I am to all that He is, all that He has done, is doing, will do in me, through me, around me, and inspite of me.  But it's not just a song.  Worship is our response with all of our lives, everything that we've been given, to all that God is. And so if we come in here in this place and we raise our hands and we raise our voices and we don't stretch these hands out when we leave this place to feed the hungry and clothe the naked and fight for the poor and the oppressed, then what you and i have done is worshiped a singer or a song, and not a God... So let me as you again, are you ready to worship?"
