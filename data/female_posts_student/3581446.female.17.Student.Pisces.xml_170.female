I also did good enough in math to skip past all the remedial crap and go straight into Algebra.  All in under 40 minutes!  Normally the test I took takes someone at least an hour and a half to finish and they don't do nearly as good.  Wanna know something even cooler?  I didn't study for it at all!  Was I nervous?  No.  Only pansies get nervous.  Eat it!  IRJ, B!
