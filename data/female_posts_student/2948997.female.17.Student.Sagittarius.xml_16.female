I've had a horrible day, not all aspects of the day beginning horrible, but there have been enough parts of today that makes me want to put it right up there with death, periods and break-ups.  To begin with, I woke up this morning after a long night of sleeping. Typical. But I laid in bed until 7:40 and I usually leave the house at 8:05. That  just  gives me enough time to shower, blowdry my hair, wash my face and brush my teeth, put my ear buds in and walk to school with a grumpy look upon my face. But for some odd reason, this morning was not a-typical. When I crawled out of bed at 7:40, I stripped down and headed for the washroom only to find it was in use. Not a good thing considering my time is quickly ticking away. I'm sort of panicking now because I don't know whos in there and how long they will be taking. I listen and discover its my Dad and he's pretty sick at the moment. In a moment of selfishness, I swore under my breath and clenched my fists. I ran down to the basement to our second washroom and threw open the shower door. You may be asking yourself, "Self...why didn't Kate just shower downstairs?" Answer: Because its my brothers bathroom and theres god knows what actually growing there, and...I know what boys do in the shower by the way. So, from there I removed the shampoo from the washroom and quickly washed my hair in the sink. Whatever. Thats fine. I head back into my room and well, I'm running behind schedule. Fuck that I guess as I sit on my bed reading my book, blow drying my hair and thinking about what else is going to happen today.  I walk out of the house then with music in my ears, trying to drown everything out already. Its started really early today. I get to class and its pyschology. I don't need this class, but whatever 'cause I signed up to take it and well I'm not going to drop it because its boring. Its a horrible class and I sit through another lecture from a 60 year old British man with always erect nipples. Thats enough of that. "Remember you have a test tomorrow". Great. Math class next, well...beautiful. Now my math teacher is one of those kids you  know  got beat up as a teenager and he's taking it on the "popular" kids in his classes. Whatever, at least he's not getting on my case. I'm rather quiet in that class, theres no need to pretend I know what I'm doing.   Band Spare, beautiful. Fucking great. Come home and eat lunch meat. Sick. But beautiful. I know what the rest of my life is going to be like. I then head back to school where the torture drags on. History's boring as hell today...Clark needs to get a personality.   Percussion Ensemble, cause Kula's a teacher who pushes the envelope, we're playing brooms and yelling and dancing in circles. Cool. If there wasn't SO much fucking dust in the bandroom. Can't breath and getting dizzy from the smacking of the brooms. I can hardly wait for 4:30pm. Didn't come soon enough.  Sam pulls me aside and tells me she has a friend who'd like to met me. Well...lets see. Met me. Date me? Fuck me? Love me? Marry me? Whatever. Just, angry at the world right now. So, I'll met him. It never hurts to met a new person in my life. Just I have to remember to go into with no expectations and then I can't be let down.   Work for 6:00pm...but I check my email. I'm excited because I'm going out with Alan this week. He had to cancel due to circumstances and I completely understand. I hope he takes care of himself and his family. So that sucks but its okay. I send him back an email telling to take care. Hopefully another time.   Works boring as hell. Fucking returns never stop. Then theres some girl who comes in and well...I was trying to help her out and well. I didn't know the fucking answer and I tried to help her. But there were these nerdy guys who didn't realize that I had to do my job and kept bugging me. I don't even know them. I'm sorry I couldn't help this woman better. For fucks sake however! Then she calls back later that evening and says I was rude to her. Excuse me?! What the hell can I do for you? I'm just angry at that. I am not a rude person. I'm sorry but I can't cater to all your needs. I just wrote my boss a note saying she thought I was rude, and I was just confused and misinformed.   I was planning on walking home, but I didn't end up doing it. Dad picked me up and well, I forgot my wallet at work. Beautiful, fucking gorgeous! And my diet vanilla coke, and my liquid cheese. Then I checked if I had a copy of "In the Army Now". No. We don't fucking carry a copy of it. Screw this. I'm in love with Pauly Shore and you can't do a damn thing? Thanks Rogers.   So Dad got me, and I've been home since. I should be studying for my test, but I'm a fuckhead who just wants to blog and re-blog and set everything up. Playing around when I should be working. And QAF is on. FFS! Kate your a fuck head.  Wait a minute. On TORTUGA...I had posted a thing about friends of mine defacing PauloandDana's posters. For some reason...I almost feel that Dana thinks I got these people to do it out of vengefulness. Not the case. Lets review, I don't go there and have no control of these people. And! They have nothing to do with the election anyways. I just feel like that the attitude. I'm sorry I haven't been a nicer person as of lately. Just deal with it Kate Sleeman.  Anyways. I want to cry. I want to lie under my covers and just die. I just want to pretend I'm not here. Thats not going to work. I just want to be hugged or cuddled and told I'm loved. Have my back rubbed.   I'm pissed at myself mainly. So. I can just get over this shit, and move on. Fuck it. I don't love me today. I don't like me. I actually hate me. And its Monday.   However, this qualifies as my new blog entry.   Salute
