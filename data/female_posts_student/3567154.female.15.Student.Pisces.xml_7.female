This is all metophicly speaking. The sun shineing was when i was with Jake today (which was a lot) The clouds were drivers training, wow so much fun to sit there. Well the pouring rain was seein the resault of my stupidity takein out. I talked to Kristelle today. She is upset about Jake. I thought that they were broken up when Jake and I started goin out. Well u can guess the next part. SHe didn't know so when she got back from where ever she was, camp i think, She found out the very hard way. Well i know that feeling like all you want to do is die. So we talked and we worked out all our issues. More like my issues but regardless we are friends again. And if for some weird reason JFT reads this he needs to talk out his issues with a cartin person cause she needs it right now.  Ok happier note. I got to go see Riddick it was a 5\/\/33t /-\55 movie. Me, Tre, Jake, and his sis Jill all went to see it. Then we went and ate at NewPort (Where Jake and Jill work) And i think i ate too much cuz right now i don't feel all that well. O well i think i will go to bed SOON. O yea u might wanna tell you this 5\/\/33t /-\55 accutly means sweet ass in leet speak. Stupid Tre teaching me stupid stuff that is totly pointless. Ok well peace out
