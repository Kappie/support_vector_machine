I spend like a freaking day trying to make my new and supposed to be improved blog on greatestjournal and then suddenly, blogger says oh hey guess what, WE ARE CHANGING EVERYTHING. Fine, I'll just stay here because all my loser friends hate my other one. Blogger doesn't have boring templates anymore anyway so it's not like it matters where I go anymore. Happy?  Yeah, so it's been a REALLY SUCKY DAY. FYI: if you are on the Desicion Time mime, MAKE UP YOUR FREAKING MIND ABOUT WHEN WE ARE GOING TO MEET!!!!!! AND GUESS WHAT I AM NOT THE ONLY DIRECTOR, I DO NOT WANT TO DO EVERYTHING, I GET ENOUGH OF THAT KIND OF CRAP AT SCHOOL, THANKS THOUGH. Unfortunately I am too shy to scream at people in person so that is why the internet is such a great thing for me! Wheee! JKDBGIUYFRHJKO:RFNHKL:moitkhlmnfsgj38q49pion
