I think that if you are sick from pneumonia, it must be pretty serious, so you should cut your student some slack.  UGH  I have a rough draft of an essay due and there is no way I can even attempt to turn anything in because I wasn't in class when they went to the library to do the research.  UGH  I hate being sick and being sick around the time papers are due are the worst.  Anyway, I needed to vent.  I have to try to finish what I can.  Not to mention, my aunt's cousin died and we are going to the wake and the funeral.  =(
