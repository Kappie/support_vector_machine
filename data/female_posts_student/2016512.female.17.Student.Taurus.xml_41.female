Folkers kind of gave me a compliment today in his twisted kind of fashion.   Also Bina is the original and "superior" BAND NATZI! I almost blew up today in band. i'm sure you all know the story. grrr why does Bina have to be such a *censored* anyways now i have to put up with the wrath of bina/job/mary all in one day. damn the man for starting my day off wrong.  anyways so today's blog shall be the vent blog. tank you for understanding.   besides venting i've been working at dance and enjoying myself. yay! finally i'm getting more respect this year but lacking in other areas. h-hem...so, i'm done.
