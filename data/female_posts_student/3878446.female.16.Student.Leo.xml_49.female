Well okay not everyone, only about 6 people are leaving to go to college,  and then my brother and and some other people are leaving to go back to college. But still it's seems like everyone. So many emotions I have gone through and have yet to go through. I hate it. I always think it would be easier if i too were moving forward with my life. i hate the fact that i still have 2 years left of highschool. It's all good though, I am reallt excited for this school year, I'm 'taking the bull by the horns' and going full force, i'm going to make my last two years in highschool meaningful....sad, my friends are leaving...I'm happy for them though, I'm glad they all have plans for their lives and are pursuing their dreams. And besides there is always e-mail and the phone right?
