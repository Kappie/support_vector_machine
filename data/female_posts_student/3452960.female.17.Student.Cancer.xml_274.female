Variously we have canoed, swum, learned how to juggle clubs and been told off for moshing. Also, I got uberly rat arsed last night, mainly thanks to half a bottle of whiskey and a man called Grum.  No pics, alas, since im in an internet cafe, and dont have my camera or my cable. But rest asured that we will give you many when we return!  I have cut my elbow, and got some glow in the dark diabolo stuff, it's cool. Penmo has pulled, but I dont like her much because she smacked me really hard with a chopping board.  Today, we have been in london. we went on the tube, and went to Camden, which is the coolest place on earth and incidentally has hundreds of shops selling shrooms. Yay! No, we didn't buy any. But we did se some inredible boots which would really have suited Bri-y.  Penmo has fire Juggling balls. I don't know if i said that already, but they are cool, so I'll say it again.  We have a really great band here, they are amazing, as Emz and Bri-y should know if they actually heard them off my phone. They are really great. Go   urlLink here   to the campdown website which is really good, and has live broadcasts online. Look for us folks!  Anyway, Fairplay etc to you all, See you soon!  Rob  "Greetings" Now that Rob has relinquished control of the pc I can type a load of bollocks too! On-site activities are really dull so the only things we can actually do that are vaguely interesting are off-site, which take a long time to get to. However, this trip in London is certainly turning out to be "spiffing" good fun. It is very hot etc. I wish I didn't have to pay 20p every time I wanted to go to the toilet in London, though it is free on camp... Yum. Dave.
