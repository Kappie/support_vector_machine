We were about 5 hours late, we were supposed to start at 12, but started at 6. We had to make the icing, get the stuff for the icing, set it up, then move it, vote on dinner... We played games.   Went to the meeting. Laughed a lot. Something I needed. Thinking up ideas for the BC newsletter, and someone suggested spUUning, like CanUUdle.. (read below post). Samaya lost it. For about 10 minutes. By then, the whole group had lost it watching her, and were laughing histericly with her. We surprisingly got a lot done in the 3 or so hours.  We were constantly breaking because the rest fo the youth were gonig insane with nothing to do, and no adult supervising them. Ever so often Samaya had to remind them we were meeting, and they didn't need to sound like raging hippos up and down the hallway. Then....they were quiet. Scary quiet. We thought they had died, but we didn't go check.  Then they came back inside, and they started doing weird things to our door. Guy was back and had shepared them indoors. Samaya anticipated them coming back, and crouched down by the door to scare them. Steve and Karla came in, and just started talking to her like it was normal for Sam to sit by the door during a meeting. They said they thoguht that's what she did....  After the meeting, we left the houses and played some more games. We hung around upstairs while downstairs was being prepared for worship, then went downstairs for that. (I also have a lot of pictures of Samaya, the same person who was hiding from the mug book committee at Winnipeg) We did a good worship on discrimination, and positive thoughts, then gathered around the couches for a big game of silent football. I love playing silent football with Alicia, Samaya and Laurel. They make the game so interesting, while when we play it at youth, it's boring. You actually play the football part. It's dull. There's no excitement.   That was a rocking game. An hour and a half of it was discusing life outside the universe, and Alicia kicking and sticking her tongue out at laurel. Twas hilarious. There was an epsiode where Samaya got penance point for bouncing, and then the major issue of making Mr Humphreys, the bi-sexual camel, humping Samaya's leg...He didn't like that. Then I got him. He is a rocking camel, I must say. He has the sweetest big brown eyes, who can't love that? We were being goofy, and snuggling, and then Katrina declared that Mr Humphreys was now straight, and madly in love with me. I didn't want to leave my precious boyfriend, but, I've emailed him lots since.   At bedtime I made a lame joke. During the meeting we were discussing why people had sex at cons, because they might not see each other again. When I was snuggling on the couch, I asked Laurel for some condoms because I was gonig to have rocknig sex with Mr Humphreys, because we might not see each other again. We laughed :P  Sunday morning we finished the houses. Mine totally rocked the casbah, and then I got to play in the nursery with Phil and Tsuki, and Hot Scott, when he came in for a bit. We got to take care of 3 boys, Simon, Blake and Steel. They were all sooo cute..  My gingerbread house completely fell apart in Victoria though. And Mike says we're doing the same thing at his palce Saturday, but Tom said Fiona, Greg and I couldn't go, because we already had a gingerbread house, even though it did fall apart. Discrimination at its best.   Seminar day tomorw, and I'm probably going to go see Adam on his day off on Thursday. Comfort time. Dododo. Also might change the way I am, see how many males aren't scared off. Don't think I'll succeed for more than 20 minutes though. I'll drink to trying.  I'm out. And sexy.
