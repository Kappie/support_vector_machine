we only learn that in primary one. for english, i had no clue, i played guessing games for spelling.. there were teacher pets and i felt so envious.. in primary 3, the skool taught us science starting from the back of the textbook for science.. so i didnt know what is it called when salt is dissolved in water.. it was salt solution.. my mother asked me that question, i didnt know how to answer.. den she called me the black sheep of the family.. all the time, i asked my siblings to help me in my work, they only shook their heads and looked at how i was beaten and caned by my mother for not scoring well in my work.. so no wonder, i wanted to be a teacher pet, and i did become a teacher's pet in primary 5 and 6.. at that time, i felt so happy.. i thought to myself," hey, im not that useless afterall.." since young, i was a tomboy and befriended boys.. in primary one and two, my best friend was gordon.. but suddenly, we no longer talked to each other after going to separate classes.. in p3, p4, p5, p6, jun ming was my bosom friend, we did everything together.. we played with newborn kittens in his neighbourhood and we look with anticipation at the mother cat who seemed so tolerant of our mischief.. when the mother cat became sick and kept vomitting, we were both very worried.. for that few years, i felt so happy and without worries that i have found the best friend in town.. up to sec one, when we becamr separated by out psle results.. he went to the norm and i went to the exp.. our relationship started to fade.. and we slowly stopped talking to each other.. but i remember, we never argued before.. i was never angry with him before.. i trusted him alot that time.. still, we wrote to each other.. we became pen pals.. but i was always the one to stop writing.. in sec one, the name-calling started and i told him abt it.. he told me not to take it to heart and i tried.. i did.. but i couldnt.. in sec one and two, i found jasmine yip to be a veri good friend, i trusted her.. she was the first to know my crush on the 33-yr-old guy.. but it was only in sec 2, when i found out that she was a hypocrite, she never stood up for me when i was called a bitch.. instead, she "broke up" with me on founders' day.. she initiated it.. i did not object.. but we didnt become enemies, we only stopped contacting each other.. in sec 2, i tod elin and huiyi abt my crush on the 33-yr-od guy.. they sold me out and told other gals abt it.. they may deny it, but i know they did.. to think i trusted them.. in sec 3, i gave elin my heart.. but she actually unwitting broke it.. and up till now, i cant forget wad she did during the first skool semester and the desaru camp last year.. i felt so hurt.. i became suicidal.. i felt that nobody was there for me.. my family couldnt help much, there is the age gap.. the age gap between me and the second youngest in the family is ten years.. i didnt want to tell them.. fortunately, i turned to God.. he did ease my pain.. but as time passed, i felt like i was a great sinner.. i lied.. i swore.. and many things i did made me feel sinful.. i felt unworthy of His love.. i hated myself at one point.. soon, i hated the whole world.. i locked myself up.. and i crumbled in my heart whenever i felt abandoned.. i comforted myself.. i did everything by myself.. nobody was there to help me.. i didnt let God help me.. i dun know why.. but i didnt want any help.. even till now, words of encouragement and comfort from friends dun help anymore.. they showed their concern too late.. they could have done it earlier, so maybe i wont have depression.. now, i can only seek refuge from God.. but i am so scared that one day, even God's grace and love cant touch me anymore.. i am so scared.. till now, my heart has not been fully mended.. so im still aching and bleeding.. and my heart really hurts.. it is juz so unbearable.. i am so afraid that i cant take it anymore.. may God bless me..
