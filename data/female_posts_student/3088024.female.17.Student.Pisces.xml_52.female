Just for a second, I was watching this Dad play baseball with his two boys tonight. It is sad to think that I could throw a baseball better than this man. One of his kids was as tall as my waist, and he wound up and lobed it right into his fathers glove like a champ. Pop on the other hand, managed to hit his child 3 times with the baseball...as I was walking by. I had no idea how long they were there, but all I know is that those boys took a beating. Good intentions had become hazardous.  So yeah. Athletic. I don't think I want my little boys/girls coming to me all bruised and swollen..."Honey, what happened??" "Oh nothing Mom, we were just playing catch with Dad." So first date...you must show me that you can throw a baseball, football, and shoot a three pointer. For the kids, of course. And besides, I would like a little competition.
