But it was all pointless, the teachers in the Science department were all very welcoming, including the department chair and my cooperating teacher. Yeah me! I think I'm going to be fine, but the kids officially arrive on Wednesday and that will be the start of the true test. I get to do bulletin boards tomorrow so that will be fun, and we just have some more housekeeping to take care of before Wednesday. Oh and thank goodness for sports and music, leveling the playing field with my cooperating teacher, definitely a plus even if he's a Sox fan. Oh well, serves me right for student teaching on the South side. Goodnight all, it's late and I have another early start tomorrow, TTFN!
