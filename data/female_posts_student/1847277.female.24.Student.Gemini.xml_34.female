Another happy story.  Two years ago, I copied some CDs on to my computer.  Last fall they wouldn't play anymore.  I figured it was some sort of copyright protection, since it was exactly a year since I had copied them.  So I deleted the files.  Or so I thought.  Today, they magically reappeared on my Windows Media Player.  Meaning happy fun music for Jamie.  Sweet.  Life should normalize a bit now.   Things are still so uncertain though, on so many levels.  And I really don't like not knowing what's going to happen (although, as was correctly pointed out to me, if I always knew what was going to happen, life certainly wouldn't be very exciting)...
