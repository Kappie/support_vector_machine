I will have intermittent internet from now until September 6. For my devoted readers out there (I think there might be as many as three of you) - fear not - I will post to my blog whenever possible.  Hopefully this will be one heck of a summer - a two week road-trip (with my mom) around Europe, friends visiting, sunshine, pork cracklings and beer. Hopefully I will actually get some work done on my brilliant science fiction masterpiece that has been lingering in a dusty corner of my brain. Hopefully I'll also have exciting stories to tell everyone without having to put my life in serious danger. Finally, hopefully I will be able to relax, unwind and get some of those incredibly painful knots out of my back.  Anyway. To all my homies out there - enjoy your summer, drink too much, and nurse a few good ol' American hangovers for me. I in turn will nurse some good ol' Hungarian palinka-induced hangovers and will lovingly think of all my buddies slaving away at summer or permanent jobs.   So long suckers!
