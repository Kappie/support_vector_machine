Other people's strong opinions and odd quirks may be difficult for you to swallow, and your fuse may be a bit shorter than usual. Emotions may also be running at a high intensity, and you may find yourself doing battle with the feelings in your own heart. Perhaps someone you care deeply about is creating friction in your relationship unnecessarily.
