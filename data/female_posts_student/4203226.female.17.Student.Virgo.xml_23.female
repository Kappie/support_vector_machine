It was soo cute, yet in a very annoying   'you're acting like mom'   kind of way. and besides that today, john is going O0o0ber emotional on me.  Thats my job! not his! lol He asked me how much i really like him, because i seem uninterested lately, and he wants to know cause he wants it to work out. And i  !SUPER!  like him, its the whole mushy, i wanna try a long distance relationship feeling with him... but still...He shouldn't be getting emotional. Like I told Cassandra .."a boy who needs more  attention  than me...just not good...hehe"  ok anyways, enough of me whining, again, but i love it cause this way everyone gets to hear it! lol
