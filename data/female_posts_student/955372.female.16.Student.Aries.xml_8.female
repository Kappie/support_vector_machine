Oh no but when I go to warn sara it goes "you have just warned supersara135 from 0% to 5% even though you got warned to 20% on one shot, so fick you!" ok i'm paraphrasing but u get the point. aim is so inconsistant. hey speaking of freakishly inconsistant things, my printer, jack, (yes i named him and i named many other things too, u'll see them mentioned later in the blog no doubt) is really random. In the middle of printing it will spit out a piece of blank paper and then just keep printing! what is that!. And when u turn it on he either makes lots of really wierd computery noises or it makes no noises at all and is just ready. grrr. what a pos. hahaha ok i'm done. for now
