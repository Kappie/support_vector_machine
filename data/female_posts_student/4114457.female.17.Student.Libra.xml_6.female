We are set up with a four period A-day B-day schedule and so far it isnt too bad... i have had my first a day and my first b day. i have a total of 8 classes this way: AP PSYCHOLOGY GUITAR LITERARY MAGAZINE/ CREATIVE WRITING PRODUCTION SYSTEMS SPANISH 2 COMMUNICATIONS ALGEBRA 2 MARCHING BAND i have already started to worry about myself in class. i almost fell asleep in algebra today... ooops, but it was sooo boring and and but i wanted to sleep... WAHHH! i am also a little overwhelmed by Chris leaving saturday and this whole senior deal... this is the beginning of the end... the last two days we have gotten really bad thunderstorms, and to an extent, they match my mood, i am okay, just there is always so much on my mind. hopefully i will handle it better than i have in the past... anyway... time to socialize... hee hee hee i love the internet
