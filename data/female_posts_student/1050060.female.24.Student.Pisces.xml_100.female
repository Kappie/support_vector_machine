Well i got a phone call from mom last night. She told me that Jaime is in NB. She wanted to know where I live so that she could come and visit me. I hope i will be able to see her today because i am leaving tomorrow for Edmundston. I hope everyone will have a great Easter. I have to go. Have a good day!
