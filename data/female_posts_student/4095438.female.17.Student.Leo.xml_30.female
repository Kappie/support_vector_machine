I think it's because in my mind, the sooner I go to sleep, the sooner I wake up and catch the same bus to the same volunteer organisation to answer the same phone.   Sometimes I feel like my blog should be the well-written, entertaining type like  urlLink Stupid Evil Bastard  but then I think it's just too much work. I'd rather have a blog for me, that makes me feel better or gives me something to do, than have a blog that's just another part of my list of chores. I think that's why I got sick of  urlLink melo  - I felt like I should be writing long, entertaining posts when all I really wanted to do was ramble.  I feel sorry for  urlLink these people ... for a split second before I crack up laughing!!! Funny shit. ( urlLink want   urlLink more ?)  And now, for a little taste of classic Dubya:    "I know what I believe. I will continue to articulate what I believe and what I believe - I believe what I believe is right."  -- Rome, July 22, 2001   Is  urlLink this  who you want running your country for another 4 years?    urlLink Choose  or Lose; VOTE !  xo
