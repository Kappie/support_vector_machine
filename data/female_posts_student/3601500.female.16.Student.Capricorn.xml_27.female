I was preoccupied when I found myself researching about Marilyn Manson (he had always intrigued me, all I knew is that most people found him disgusting), read some interviews, and found him hilarious. >.>  He's weird, he's goth, he's shocking and grotesque... I like him.  o.0  Not that his music is the greatest (...and I've only seen like three video clips anyway...), but I think his attitude is amusing. *blink* I don't see why people like Ozzy Osbourne and not MM... >.> *coughs* Anyway, I just wanted to add this. :P
