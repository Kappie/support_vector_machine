There were a lot of flesh and skin been showed off. But I loved it very much. I watched the 9.50AM time slot ALL ALONE by myself! Yeah! And I thought I went to the wrong theatre as I was the only person and it was actually QUITE scary. But in the end, there were a family or two and some couples. Not many people, but of course, IT IS IN THE MORNING! Oh, I also bought FIRST magazine. It featured Lara Croft- Angeline Jolie. Actually, I bought for the sake of reading "The Twins Effect" but nevertheless it was worth it.....    6 MORE DAYS TILL THE RELEASE OF -+-THE TWINS EFFECT-+-
