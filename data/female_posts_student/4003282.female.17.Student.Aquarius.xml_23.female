I just realized it when Josh told me I should rent it. But I don't know who has it. Arg.      I still  love  my Josh.      Band was so nice today. It wasn't hot at all. I went to Oshman's and got a sports bra and some shirt and a shirt. I get paid tomorrow. And I don't have to go to work till 3 30. Whoo hoo!
