We go back down to the other house again, in an attempt to clean up the garage. Our goal is to get all the stuff sorted in piles: "To be donated to the library", "To be given to Salvation Army", and "To be kept". Of course, the "To be kept" pile should be very, very small. I should explain our little situation here, before I get any further.
