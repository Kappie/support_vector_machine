I sat completely alone in the dark auditorium, watching with tears in my eyes and envy in my heart.  A little boy sitting in front of me, turned and stared, like little boys do.  All I could do was smile and think "I swear I have friends".  and from the depths of my heart I thought... "They are all up there, doing what they love...without me".  I shrank back into my seat, feeling small and utterly alone, but I couldn't help but smile for my those who were up there, having the time of their lives, and being completely fantastic."  Thanks to a fellow blogger, I am able to express in words (or cut and paste rather) my life in a nutshell, well at least in the past 2 months. Thank you ever so kindly.
