I will be leaving I think the second week of August so that will be a little over 2 months. I am really excited about my new job which I start next week, it seems like it will keep me busy for at least 8 hours and I always down for some overtime. The next few weeks are going to be crazy for me because I am going to be working a total of four jobs. I start my new job next week, I will still be working here about 2 hours a day just to make sure the daily reports get done and the paperwork gets faxed, I also do promotions on the side but that is during club hours( that is the only fun in my life) and then I still work at the same part time job that I have had for six years at the bank but that is only on Saturdays. I have to find a way to cut back on the amount of work I am doing. So over the next few weeks or month I should have at least 4000 coming in which I don't think is bank at all it could be more but who knows. I guess you can say I am an workaholic but is that a bad thing. I really want to take the boys (Elijah and Jeremiah) on a trip. I know it requires plenty of money to take children on vacations so I am saving up for it. I have to find a place that is good to travel to during the winter months. Do you have any ideas? Well that is enough about work. I think I need to erase the post the I put up last week when I called my childrens grandmother and aunt hoes. I think I was rude and I don't know who reads these things anyways. Wouldn't want to start any unneccessary drama. I better find something to do because I am running out of things to talk about. See I used to spend my entire day here applying for jobs, but I have a job now that is paying well, so I don't need to look anymore at least right now. But in a few months I will start my search again because this job ends in December. I should just start my own temp agency and work all the jobs myself. LOL Just a thought nothing serious.
