This link is to my friend Alyce' s blog.             urlLink http://cute_as_candy.blogspot.com/           I thought that hers was cool so I started one of my own :). I'm on summer holidays right now and if you've read my profile, I think that you'd have figured out that I'm not a normal girl because I like comics, playing on the PS2 and I like all the slash hack films. However, I do like boys because I like Luke Mably who was Prince Eddie in The Prince and Me which also happens to be a fantastic movie by itself with good actors and actresses including Julia Stiles who I think was a good choice cos she's a great actress. I used to like Orlando Bloom but thats kinda gone now. He was my longest celeb crush. I like him for about two year. Before that, I kept on changing my mind. James Franco's pretty hot though...;P (Spiderman 1 and 2). Orlando is a a bit of an idiot because he was a highschool dropout and have you read his reviews? The comments he gives are sooooooo stupid. Like "The experience has been crystalized in my heart forever." WHAT!?!?!? How sissy can you get man?  Seeing how these are the summer holidays, I've already visited Pulau Redang which is one of Malaysia's most beautiful islands. I went diving there with my parents, sadly my brother couldn't come along 'cos of his job. I didn't see anything extremely interesting though I did see some interesting animals like cleaner shrimps and file fish. :) I'm going to Bali later near the end of August with my family. My brother has applied for leave and hopefully it will be approved.     Ttfn ("ta ta for now!" in the wise words of Tigger from Winnie the Pooh)  Evernix   urlLink
