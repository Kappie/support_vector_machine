One contributing factor to my happiness may be that my mom is going to make me a stuffed  urlLink Mr. Nice  doll. Yes. That's right. A Mr. Nice doll. My sister wanted one to give her to her friend for her birthday, so my mom said she would make me one too. I am so excited about this, it's not even funny.  And for those of you who didn't know the joy of Mr. Nice before now, you were seriously deprived and you should thank me for helping you live a purposeful life, because reading the book was not enough.
