At first I thought it was slow and not all that great but by the end I adored it. It reminded me a great deal about how Wendi and I are. Kind of the whole different paths thing but whenever wherever needed we would be there. I love the fact that I have a friend like that. She is my family and I adored this movie for the simple fact that, well except for the sleeping with rock stars, we're just the same. Every group of girlfriends should see this movie. [ Wed Oct 02, 10:32:39 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Possession   So I had a chance to watch Possession (Gwenyth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhardt). It was good and I liked it but it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. It was a story about a romance that happens between two people as they track down clues on a romance between two very dead poets. It's interesting and I think it moves very well, I guess what I found so freakishly annoying is that the romance between the current day people is really nothing but a vessel to weave the story of the passionate romance these two lovers shared. Anyway, it's a good video flick.
