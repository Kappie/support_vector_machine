I have to say it's quite funky and I love doing nothing more than going for a run, and coming home to relax on my swing! Or of course going shopping, or to the beach, all the things that I love to do, when I want to do them, what could be better?!!  Ooh the meal.............................................It has arrived (nearly) and I have to say I am quite looking forward to it, it will be a nice to round off! Hmmmmmm you may say no, but I was thinking to myself again the other day that I would quite like to make a toast (don't no if you spell it like that, but that is how it is staying because it says what it is meant to mean) Nothing to formal etc....But I do have some things that I would like to say to people!! (Don't panic, its not I WANNA KILL YOU, unless of course I see people I HATE - *coughs*Katie, Danielle, Becky and co.) hmmmmm who is actually coming ...........Me......hmmmmm.....*thinks*... I wonder if it is some strange plot to leave me at the place on my own........ hmmmm lol  Anyways......*thinks*........      lol   Nah was going to say something else but my memory is becoming worse, I need to invest in some more post-it notes!! Ummmmmm........*what was it*......Ahhh yes that was it again I was thinking I should start doing something that calms the mind, like yoga or similar. I have been told before that it calms the mind and soothes the soul, and lets face facts I need something to calm my mind don't I!! hmmmm......*ponders*...........I shall invest in some sort of video I think......I think I think way to much sometimes.........  I shall leave you in a state of confusion that you have no doubt(lol the No Doubt thing was unintentional I can assure you) become accustomed to after reading what tripe I write!!  Much Love as always Noony (ahh bugger, I mean Nat, I have just seen Steph so that explains he Noony thing, as that is what she shouted at me from the car)
