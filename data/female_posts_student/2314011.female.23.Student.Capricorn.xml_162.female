It feels really fucking great.  Just finished the two major outlines for the two major exams next week.  Only in Contracts can two weeks of class add 15 pages to an outline.  But it is complete at last, coming in at just under 45 pages.  I'll think about hacking it down to 10 sometime this weekend.    Now on a little break before I dig in with the last bits of Criminal Law, Torts and Civil Procedure (which is mostly editing Miss Q's notes from the last two classes--no wonder it takes her a solid 2 months to outline, everything anyone could possibly know is included in those suckers!  Twice!).    Feeling soooo much better about everything as the week goes by.  A big part of it is studying with the gang.  Who knew study groups could be so helpful?  No more of this island-mentality for me, that's for damn sure!  Well, at least in respect to studying for finals.  I can be an island the rest of the day.  Classes winding down feels nice too.  It's been a while since I've been  excited   about the end of the year arriving.  Last May was spent in denial about Graduation and going through too many goodbyes to be very much fun.    And there's so much to look forward to this summer.    The weekend in Bozeman right after the last exam: nothing but celebration and investigating new possibilities.  Return to the Library:  I'm famous there and they're paying me more than ever.  Cool Cousin's Wedding:  Getting some nice family time, full of congratulatory pats on the head and hanging out with the newly-weds at a hip-happenin' piano bar after the big shin-dig.  Hopefully the parents will retire to the hotel early.    Pride in Seattle:  missed it last year and this one is sure to be the best yet.  Ever.    And all that's only in the first month!!!    But first, there are two weeks to triumph over, and I shall return to preparing for the battle ahead (which has magically transformed into something less ominous, oddly enough).
