I'm glad I stayed up til midnight yesterday although I was physically beaten. I've got the flu bug.   First day of school was great! I got to see everyone again.. I miss my friends and my teachers so much. =) I miss Miss Halizah and other teachers who wouldn't be teaching us this year. *Sniffles* Our class parent is Mrs Tan Bee Bee. Incredibly meticulous. I was nominated to be the class chairperson.. I hope I can do my stuff well and not let anyone down.. and Geetha saluted me. Wow.. so honoured :P   Would be very busy next week due to the CCA Open House. So fun!! Really exhilarated.. It better not rain on that day! Mmkays, my eyes are as dry as meatballs. I really need to get some sleep. Toodles sweeties!
