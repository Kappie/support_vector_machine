Very surreal for me, but kind of oddly reminicent for him. I guess that I have this really romanic view of the 1970's. I keep assuming that the songs I hear on the radio and in movies was what everybody listened to. I just assume that there was one type of music. People had their preferences, but basically you either listened the radio or you didn't. Well, evidentally, that's not the case. My dad was NOT into Disco at all, and come to find out, it would be like being into Pop music today. KC even compared himself to 'Nsync, saying that he was my generation's mom's Justin Timberlake. It was really enlightening.  I really felt odd, in that I never expected to see any of these people, they are out of another world, a past society that can't be accessed any more.  The Village People were SO ... the Village People! They didn't disappoint at all, nor did they exceed expectations. Just right. The guys were all the original line up, minus the Motorcycle guy (he quit in the 80's and the picked up a new guy).   The Village People Preforming  The Village People also informed everyone that most of the US has been doing the YMCA wrong. so they had this whole tutorial. It was REALLY funny! Well, I'm doing my part and spreading the word, here you go,  urlLink click here  for an animated tutorial.  It was SO much fun, my only regret was that Maggie couldn't be there. My dad isn't the best dancer in the world, and it was just better to sit and watch.
