Your music channels lots of emotion. On the top it seems simple, but underneath there's always a deep meaning...  As your name you're independent from most of music!  Stay that way!  Good on you!  There's so much variation in your style...from deep and thoughtful like The Stills, to happy go lucky like Belle  Sebastian, to dancy and catchy Franz Ferdinand, and back to boogie down Hot Hot Heat and The Rapture...    urlLink   What genre of rock are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Fun stuff! I am indie rock and I lurve indie rock. Maybe I do like Quizilla...    You're addicted to.....  Nothing!  Your addicted to nothing at all? Well..... ok I guess thats a good thing but come on just think of the possibilities!    urlLink   What are you addicted to? (pics!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Find this extremely hard to believe. Especially because I have been taking these quizzes compulsively for the last twenty minutes. I definitely should not have started this Dave... it was a very bad idea!   urlLink     What Finding Nemo Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    It's Nemo!!! Hahahahaha! I am a Nemo!    You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Well, if I had to be any kind of candy I am glad to be chocolate. Hmm, I am actually rather hungry. Just a couple more quizzes then.    Congrats! Your a Pure Angel! Angels, as far as most of them go, are all compatabile creatures, but Pure ones simply are symbols of God. Pure Angels always appear when a child is born, when a rainbow is seen, or when someone shares their first kiss. They never grow old, an can appear in the shape of a naked woman with white, bold wings. Pure angels are the carriers of god, and show their love to everyone in the world.    urlLink   What Kind of ANGEL are you? (For Girls only) This Quiz has amazingly Beautiful Pictures!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I don't think I like the whole god thing but the picture is pretty!     You belong in the land of darkness, otherwise known as one of the worlds in which I dwell. All here is beauty inspired by tragedy and great sorrow. Write or go through other creative outlets to express the anguish you may be feeling, and never let anyone tell you that you are just being 'weepy' or full of 'teenage angst'(if you're a teenager.If not, then they really should be punished for calling you one. They probably are trying to insult your maturity...fools.)and always remain yourself, dark and amazing. Never change.    urlLink   Where do you belong?(ANIME IMAGES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Erm, right then. A little scary. I think I will go relax and be tired and watch movies and eat some lunch. Yay! May post more later, may not. My back is very sore. I am in need of some chiropracting!
