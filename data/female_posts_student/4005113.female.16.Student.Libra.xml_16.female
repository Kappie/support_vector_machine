    
       I just sent out an email to y'all with my contact info on it. I would love it if you'd send me mail and stuff. I particularly like the following:  Money  Food  Credit cards in your name  Personal checks  And also money  Just thought you should know.  Also, I was going to send Morganna's mailing address in that email, but seeing that I sent that email to a lot of people who don't know Goo, I figured I'd send a separate email. You'll get that shortly, but I have to find the paper with Goo's address on it first.  I love you all, and don't really send me money or I'd feel really bad. Unless you have a surplus of money or something and don't want to pay the taxes on it... or if you win the lottery or KENO or something.   But seriously, send me letters and stuff, because it's really exciting to get mail. Also call me, because I have my own phone and voice mail (on my dorm phone) for the first time in my life! It's so ROCK!
