I didn't even watch any good television shows which is also pretty depressing.  Today I signed up for soccer.  This will probably be the last team that I play on because I don't really want to play on varsity.  But who knows, the past two years I have been talked into it, some things never change.  I'll update when I actually have something interesting to say.  Here's to wishing I was back at the Dave concert...
