Now I don't know what the hell Rosie told him, but he had the pointed forwardness to say I sounded like a moron when he has no  fucking  idea about me, living in his little shell of "the world is mine because I'm smart".  I can judge, why, because I've seen people just like him before, number one, and I've heard the stories of what he's done and how he's done things, and I must say it really isn't an impressive personality type by any stretch of the imagination.  Yes, Rosie really loves those resiliant, down-to-earth guys. That was staunch sarcasm, by the way.  When I said drop it, I meant the "HEY IT'S OVER" shit, questions about the past are cool :) ok, just making sure it didn't look like I was biting anyone's head off other than Rosie's.
