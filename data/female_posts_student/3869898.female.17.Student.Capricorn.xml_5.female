If I am so logical...it should be logical that i am a dumb girl..who needs no boys...they fuck everything up!... HArd time i have been in much harder tiems but wiht the same boy and i wonder will it ever get old. Do boys enjoy the satisfaction they get out of hurting a girl who loves them so...maybe it is the whoel ahve the cake and eat ti to...make you bed a lay in it...I dunno...one girl doesn't satisfy all that a biy needs. I wonder to myself is it really nessicary to have ever created the male race..my conclusion...NO! They just play games and walk all over the brokem pecies and then i wonder...when i sence enjoyment in the voice....the male race gains exstacy from the ones the have hurt! The one thing i have to do is be strong...ya knwo not give in to tematation...you think after everythign i have been through it would be easy to walk away from all the maddness....but oddly not! It tears me to peices and i hurt even more watching myself make the dumb choice.....there is this thing me and karen once figured out....when we experience pain it hurts us then but after wehave healed we run back to whatever hurt us...putting your hand in fair and then doing it again...you knew it hurt the first tiem why do it again??? If only i could understand all these things in my mind.....Basically Jessica don't talk to the "fire", don't think about the "fire" and you won't get hurt!! Yet i countine to love and yern for that pain....well not the pain...but in all reality...I set myself up for it.......maybe on a better note...I saw anchorman...ok no so good but kiled 2 hours...going away tommorow get me away from all the craziness that is the teenag years....GOSH OH GEE i am looking foward to college...tired of the terror of high school drama...adn the girls who are out of high school still wanting to be in the drama....But one lesson learned...never fight over a boy...you just night find out he likes the other "whore" better! Until later days...
