"Rabbi Shmuley Boteach has attacked Madonna, calling her a "slut" and a "vulgarian." In a startling essay for SomethingJewish.Co.UK, the Rabbi blasts Phillip Berg, the head of the Kabbalah Centre for letting the Material Girl be the religions highest-profile spokesperson."  granted, having madonna as the kabbalah spokeswomen is not exactly what i would call, an intelligant move, but hey - it's certainly not an abomination either. as a madonna fan, i take everything she says and does with a grain of salt, and as a jew, i understand where rabbi shmuley is coming from. afterall, he is orthodox and madonna, well, she certainly is not. hell - she's not even jewish. and there is problem #1. heh.   read what i am talking about  urlLink here.
