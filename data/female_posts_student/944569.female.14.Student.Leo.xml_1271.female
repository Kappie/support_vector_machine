This is such bliss :3 Unfortunately I have to stay here until the end of the first week of March Break.  Can you believe that the ppl here have already had their Spring Break one week before us and it lasted for only one week?!  I really won't like that when if i ever go to Pace Academy.  You won't believe how much nicer it is than TFS.  Sure there are uniforms but they only wear those four times a year.  All the other days are casual.  Assemblies are held every morning at 8:00 ( I can't wake up then.  I'll be late every morning. *sigh*).  Their library is amazingly huge too.  I still think that if I ever went there I'd miss TFS a lot too.  Besides, everything there looks so...old.  The buildings in which all the important staff members are is called the "Castle".  Students who have been at Pace since childhood are "lifers".  The "Minstrels" and "Troubadors" are the choir.  It's sort of sad how they think that they're so Medieval Age-like.  However, I'd give anything to study drama or perform in that theater of theirs.  It's absolutely gorgeous ^_^.  Moving along, we ate at a nmber of interesting restaurants and went sight-seeing a bit.  I got to see the world's first KFC!  Yay!  How exciting!  Did you know that there was also a KFC hotel in the first place?  I now know the entire history of this popular fast-food place.  Muaha!  Colonel Sanders was actually quite the marketing genius.  I laughed so hard when I saw antique action figures of him on display. It seems that everywhere I look in Atlanta, Coca-Cola is there.  Perhaps because they are all so proud to be the birthplace of the miracle pop.  In fact, my interviewer for Pace says that her hudsband works for Coke and that she herself spoke fluent Chinese in order to go to China to promote the drink.  We also ate a a really awesome Asian restaurant (there seems to be a shortage of that in Atlanta).  It was in a boxcar.  Can you believe that?  The box car is still in it's station and ready to run but it's been shut off and turned into a restaurant.  The sushi there was wonderful (yay!  Pass the raw fish!  Sashimi!).  I ate lots of spiders and caterpillar rolls.  Mmm... heheh...Spiders are actually just the soft-shell crabs renamed that as a joke.  And the caterpillar rolls?  Just a line of sushi covered by avocado to make it look like a caterpillar.  I dont eat bugs dont worry.  It seems that my father knew all the people at the restaurant.  I blushed when some of the waiters said I was pretty in Chinese (they thought i didnt understand but i showed them!  MUAHAHAHA!).  I met my father's customer and had to act like the good little girl.  Unfortunately, I might need to do a little babysitting for him in order to win his favors for my father.  I found it insulting when he complemented me though.  Here's how the conversation went.  Customer:  You know who your daughter reminds me of, David? Pocahontas. Dad:*perplexed* Pokemon?! Me: *choke on soup* Customer:  No, Pocahontas.  It's a complement.  She's gorgeous.  Here, Carly (daughter).  Doesnt Nicole look like Pocahontas? Carly: *looks at me* No.. Customer: ... Me: *thinking* Isn't Pocahontas an Native American?  Are my eyes really as slitted as hers.  Sheesh.  That's not really a complement.  You could have said Mulan.  That would have been more subtle...  I miss you all so much!  How are all your breaks coming along?  I want every single detail!       No way do I look like her. NO WAY!    This could've worked... >.
