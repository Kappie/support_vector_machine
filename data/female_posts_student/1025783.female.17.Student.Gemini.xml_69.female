He looked upon the peaceful earth Sang to the people and the trees Then stomped and thrashed until all was still He then went back into his home and sat down quietly Opening his book he began to read Once upon a time there was a horrible ogre What a strange story he chuckled to himself....and popped a few children in the oven on broil.
