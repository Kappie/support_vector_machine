Well, they didn't just start, but I keep having these dreams that I'm  urlLink Sabrina the Teenaged Witch.   I dream that I date  urlLink Harvey Kinkle , I dream that I have magic powers when I wiggle my finger, but I never dream of episodes I've already seen...I find myself in situations totally unrelated to the show, but still involving many of the characters.  Although I'm my ususal diva self in my dreams, not Sabrina, but I still see myself as  urlLink Melissa Joan Hart .  I think I'm fucking psychotic.  Why do I keep having these dreams?  When I'm not having these dreams I'm having these other ones where I'm trying to get my whole family inside my house and lock all the windows and doors becuase a pack of  urlLink mountain lions  are trying to get inside and kill my family.  Except my family keeps trying to go outside and just pretend nothings happening or they try and let the cats inside.    I think I need therapy.
