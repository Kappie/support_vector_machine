So Jess, being interested as she always is, opened up to it and starting laughing at such verses as - "Your breasts are perfect; like twin deer feeding among lilies (Song of Songs 4:5)" And she comes up and says to Jess, "No Jess, that's for holiday reading only" Hahah...what is she on?  SO now we r in Civics Geography, one of the worst possible subjects, and we have to research holes. I am doing Cooma, NSW and it is the biggest hole in the world. I ashamed that it is to be associated with our state. They are rapidly losing their population, and you know what they have done to try and get people back? OK, wait for it!  Opened a Llama Farm!!  I am dead serious. These people are freaks. Mrs. Huge (aka. Mrs. Hughes) is "patrolling" She thinks I'm working, but how dumb is she - she never thinks to look down to mi minimised windows. So, so stupid. Haha, and MR. CASH has come in! He is like this physco butch stdent PDHPE teacher. He's a freak and annoying. And he follows Mrs. B around all the time. Ahh, the "Roseville Big Brother" people are wtahcing me!  And ASHLEY WACHMAN just walked past- she is mi stalkers sister. His name is Nick and he's really scary and he has bright orange hair. Mel and I met him at Lake Maquarie and he became obsessed with me. He would stand outside our door all day, and then one time he stood outside our door from 12.00pm to 2.00am no joke. He was sooo scary!! And he asked 4 mi number as well, and I gave him a fake 1. Felt bad, but u know, I had 2. I'm experienced with dealing with stalkers. I hav had a few. Its strange. I seem to hav a knack for attracting strange, scary and stalkeresque guys!! Ahhhh.... Better b off, bells gonna go in a minute, and then I hav freedom!! yay! Blogging off, Beth
