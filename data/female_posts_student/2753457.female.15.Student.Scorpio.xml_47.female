I was rooting for her friend the whole time. No one as hot as Tad Hamilton can ever be that nice. And then we walked to the houses overlooking the lake in her neighborhood. I had no idea that was there. It's a nice place. I'd go there all the time if I lived that close. Then when I got home I messed around, and I watched The Truth About Cats and Dogs. That is also cute. When my mom and sister got home, they announced that we were going to see Bon Voyage at the Colony. So that makes three movies. I liked Bon Voyage a lot though. Very entertaining. It makes me wish I was French. Shit, I guess that'll never happen. And THEN on the way home, I realized that we had rented In America and it was due the next day. And I really wanted to see that movie. So that made four movies in one day. And two times that I wished I wasn't American. Very good movie. I encourage you all to see it. Yesterday I went to the pool with Mary Alice. That was fun. I have even more freckles. Once again, this was within walking distance. I wish I had a pool within walking distance. I got to eat spaghetti with her family. Oh, and I installed AIM for her. Yay for communication. I didn't watch any movies that day. Probably time for a break from that. I'm such a freak. In an hour or so, I'm going to walk up to Joncie's house to see her and the crew before she leaves for Spain tomorrow. I should go practice. I've got the lesson today.
