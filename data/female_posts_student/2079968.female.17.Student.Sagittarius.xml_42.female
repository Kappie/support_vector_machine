I've not been to school for about a week because of being really sick, then because of really bad weather.  Haha...Andrew gave me an early present today...i got  Punk'd   on dvd...something I didn't expect to get :-P But i liked it nevertheless. We didn't know the language wasn't edited...oh well. At least they left "Naked Shopper" blurred. Not a sight I care to see.  So be happy happy happy, ok?  And if you're not, think of...nothing. Because ignorance is bliss, my friends.
