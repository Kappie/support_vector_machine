Wore my purple kebaya and black pants at my own convenience. Damn bloody hot day.Nevertheless,had lotsa fun. Taking pics and such. My friends and i all wore pants. Borea la.. Ahahz.. My friends came to my house at 7.10 like that and all of us went together. Like grand entrance like that.. 7.30 then enter the school hahaha.. Late la of cos.. But Mr Raj let us go on behalf of Racial Harmony. Yeahz yeahz~ ....        God.. Its like battle of the cheongsams. Rafta wore a real nice pink cheongsam. Damn, if i slim down, i mite be able to wear that next yr but trust me, i dun think i'll be wearing any cheongsams from now on. No originality. Played alot in front of zakiah's camera. Thanx to Moon. My funny faces ended up saved in Zak's camera. Lols. I didnt take any fotos with alot of guys tis time. Only with Weihan, Ismail and Amirhadi ( is that how u spell the name?) haha.. cosIsmail looks so much like my ex, Irwan frm S'pore Poly. Weihan.. Haix.. No need to explain la. If not for his bloody pea-brain antics, i wld have thot he's one of the gorgeous guys arnd. But,i take backmy words. Hahaha.. Took a pic with amirhadi la. Yeah..He's one of the only 2 guys i find handsome in school. Bt i shall stop there and say no more. Haha. = My lips are sealed and tight. The other handsome guy.. Nowhere to be seen. But heckz~        After school, we went to Tampines BK to eat! Hungry like hell.. Whopper meal each. Then we went to finish up my film and took pics at the Standard Chartered Building. Da abes lik dat.. Went home la.. At arnd 5 plus i think. Tired. I wore heels but strangely, my feet didnt hurt a single bit. Lols. Reached home, took a bath and went to bed straight. Couldnt tahan animre.. So tired. Im not the least prepared for my Maths test tomorrow. Argh!!  #Take me out!#     ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~
