After tat we made our way down to the train staion to meet our dear qihao...keke~ went to far east walk walk...took neoprints...find my purse...can't find...saw yinru aaron yingning and eunice dere... we walked to taka then saw a really cute purse but i have no money to buy lez...so no choice have to go home empty-handed.           Before we went to the esplanade to watch the fireworks, we went to breadtalk buy bread there to eat in case we hungry. so poor thing, we ate bread for dinner lehZ...       The fireworks simply rocks!!! the best fireworks i've ever watched. those who missed it is a real pity. however i dunno y i dun feel tat happy after all...maybe beocs he wasn't there... i dun noe... many ppl actually asked mi to watch the fireworks with them and yet all i wanted is to watch with him. I've waited there for him as though he might not come at all...held on to my phone and waited for him to call as though he might not call at all... In the end he never came...not even a phone call from him, just a cold cold message which says tat he can't make it. I mean wat was i thinking of...haha...we are just friends...realli...juz friends.....
