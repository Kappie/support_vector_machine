He kinda reminds me of A, actually; does crazy things and can write about practically nothing for eons :D A, we love you!! It's the weird, funny questions he gets from readers (and his responses) that he posts, though, that are the greatest. They also make me want to be famous. I'd make a website devoted specifically to the stupid things people ask me. I'd spread rumours about myself, too, just to see what kind of other stupid questions people would ask me. It'd be so fun!! I'd love to make a website just dedicated to real, stupid questions I'm asked. Maybe I'd post answers, too. Ooh! It'd be like a 'serious' website, except all the questions are stupid!   Mwahaha... And then, I shall rule the world with cocoa-puffs and Irish whisky! w00t!   Among other things, I went to the DareARTS office this morning, because N refused to email me back with the answers to my questions. Stupid, stupid, STUPID woman. She hates me. Anyway, so I go over there, she answers my questions, I prepare to leave.  And then!  M and N spontaneously decide to RE-DO EVERY SINGLE VALUE I HAVE TO WRITE ABOUT! As in, go through every single lesson plan, every single story, and every single activity concerning this goddamn Human Spirits Collection and change it. For no reason except they 'didn't like the order.'   I dunno about them, but this would have helped a  lot  more had it been done a few months ago.   But that's not all! Not only are they imbeciles for fixing something that's not broken, they don't make decisions. I was just dying to get out of there, so I practically led them by the hand and said, "We'll do this, this, and this." I'm 15 frikkin years old. Come on. I shouldn't be able to boss around the president of one of the most highly-regarded charities in Ontario. But I had no choice! The two of 'em would just go on and on about how they  might  do this, how they  could  do that and that it would  possibly  be beneficial if they did something else! They talked for ages about the specific word they'd use to describe the value! Does it really matter so much?! The kids are 5-9 years old. They're not Einsteins. Their parents forced them into the program in the first place. And I'll bet they're wasted half the time, too, considering where they live. Do they  really   care  whether we use the word 'sympathy' or 'empathy??'   Adults can be really dense sometimes. I hate it when people are indecisive. If they'd just  do  the damn thing, maybe something would  get done . Hemming and hawing ain't gonna help nobody, and isn't that what DareARTS is all about?   On the bright side, I've got over 15,000 words done. Yay! That leaves 35,000 'till 50,000!! And I've been writing for what, a week? Mwahaha!! I'm just scared that someone who knows what they're talking about will read it and say it's crap :P I mean, it's not the Great Canadian Novel, of course not, it's Fantasy, but still. I'm a touchy person ^^;;;
