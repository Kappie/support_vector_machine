I was looking for a top for the usher concert and again didnt find one but i did find a shirt that said 'please hung me, Dont eat me' and it had a picture of a pig on it.    Well me and zoe went to CVS and got a disposable camera and we went around all these stores and acted really weirdly but it was so fun. we got pictures of each other doing stupid stuff. lol. like trying on these ugly hads or wearing thoses fluffy boa things. with the feathers. We went into Saphora and i did a Jessica Simpson pose. I took the  edible cream stuff, put some on my finger and did wat she did in her advertisement.  Zoe took a picture of it.  Then we took one of thoose water things and sprayed each other with them. It was so fun!     Then at claires i took tons of scarfts and did this super model pose. oh yeah. And then Zoe put on a 'Mrs. Kutcher' hat and i snaped a shot.    Then we went on the carosel. We took pictures of that too. We were having so much fun! acting like we were really on horses. lol.   I was planning on having zoe sleeping over but when she got here i started getting into fights with my mom and spencer and konrad and she had to go home. God i hate that. Spencer started the whole thing he is such a loser!   Well thats all for now. ill write l8r...  Samie
