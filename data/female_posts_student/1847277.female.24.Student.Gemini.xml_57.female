So in Jamie's world, things are going fairly well.  The paper is chugging along- I've spent maybe four or five hours working today and have gotten nine solid pages written.  Tomorrow morning I have to get up early to try to add some more, but I'm thinking that maybe by mid-Saturday I can finish up.  That leaves Sunday to kind of relax and work on reading for my Linguistics discussion on Tuesday.  I found out on Monday that the money for the project in India was procured, but that doesn't solve the permit problem.  Apparently next week they are going to work on contacting the appropriate people in Delhi and see how that goes, although they are none too optimistic at this point.  As I've lamented before, it's looking more and more like it'll be another cold winter in Ann Arbor.  If I can't go I have to work out some sort of crafty scheme so that I can still travel with Dave.  As is, in order to participate in the Montenegrian project I will have to negotiate with the faculty to leave school two weeks prior to the end of classes (not including finals week).  I am wondering if I could pull off leaving three weeks early, spending the first week in southern Spain with Dave, convincing Bob not to say anything to the profs.  I think it will depend on the nature of the classes I end up taking, like whether they involve actual final exams or not.  If it's papers and projects I can just get my ass in gear and get stuff done early.   We shall see, we shall see....
