Part of me wonders if they're incredibly unlucky, unprepared, unorganized, etc. or if they're going to be the ones cruising through the exams.  The girl I talked to said she was there until 11 last night.  That means she had 9 hours before Property class this morning.  I'm remembering all the things the upperclass-persons told us the first few weeks of class about how each student will have his/her own study methods and not to judge your own by the person next to you.  And really, we'll only know for sure what works for us and what wastes time is next January after the grades have been posted and the exams are reviewed the first day of class.    A 2nd year told me today: "No matter what happens this semester, you still have second semester to make up for it."  They don't actually kick you out until after your first year's completed.  Less than a C average will do it.  Doesn't  sound  hard.  My Contracts professor gave one (1) A last fall.  Torts professor, five (5) As.  And as dire as all this is beginning to sound, I'm really not worried that I'm going to bomb the whole thing completely; it's just the obligatory "what ifs..." starting to perk up.  So, have to go through the process of dealing with them and being comfortable with my level of preparation.  Or do more.    Tonight I cut the study time a bit short to go to a panel discussion on AIDS.  I know, World AIDS Day was Monday, so what the hell is left to talk about?  Don't really know why I felt compelled to go, but think it has something to do with the fact that I've never attended anything like it in the past.  Ever.  It just seemed right somehow.  There was about 20-25 people there.  Don't know why I expected a crowded courtroom, but I did.  There are less people dying but more people getting infected.  My guess would be that because there's less death, less attention's being paid to the ever-increasing problem.  Without the action/excitement/drama of people dying, what is there to do/care about people just getting sick?  Suppose I have one more issue to listen for when the candidates make their pitches.    Speaking of which, I just have to say that Carol Moseley Braun, even though she doesn't stand a chance, is totally my nominee.  If, by some bad B-movie completely unforeseen and unwarranted twist of fate, she were to win the nomination, I think she may just have a shot at the office, if only on the sheer novelty of the idea.  Folks have been known to vote (and win) on similar grounds.  The thing I love about her most is the fact that she's the only candidate actually SAYING anything because she has nothing to lose.  Dean, Kerry and Gephardt all have to bide their time, talk in parables and lofty goals, waiting until the race actually starts before they actually start saying anything when they speak.  The remaining candidates are, honestly, entertainment, CSPAN fodder.  I'm still waiting for Hillary to change her mind.  Or for the party to draft her into the nomination.  There's petitions, you know.
