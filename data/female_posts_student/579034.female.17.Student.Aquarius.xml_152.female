Dude, seriously I can watch the movies and in each scene pick out at least 5 mistakes per scene. And I can watch the trailer for the new movie and in that ALONE I can pick out so many mistakes. Imagine, if the trailer is riddled with mistakes the movie is going to be drowing in them! How could they let this happen! How can JKR let this happen to her books! I just can't stand how Hollywoodified these movies are I hate it! I mean, the most basic mistake is their ages, but I mean that can't be helped. The second BIGGEST mistake is Harry's eyes are supposed to be GREEN and Daniel Radcliffes are BLUE... WTF!?!?!?!?!?! One of the main concepts of the books is that Harry share's Lily's eyes! That's supposed to be the main concept of one of the next few books and they are totally undermining it. They just don't seem to care that they are butchering the books. Another huge mistake is the clothing and the rewritten plot themselves. I mean, they are supposed to have thier own wizards fashion, not miggle clothes, I swear I have the same jacket that Hermione wears. And I mean WTF is up with the whole Harry totally all over Hermione thing in the pictures I've seen?? That NEVER happens in book 3. The most interaction they have together in book 3 is Hermione gripping his forarm cause she's a lil scared they aren't all over each other like friggin I don't even know. I mean really, plus the whole like thing about how wizards have their own culture and don't mix with muggle society (which includes clothing). I really can't stand how the movies are going. Also I hate these kids that see the movies and think they are the greatest thing with out even considering the books. I mean the books are cannon and the movies are just gay. They are good for what they are but they aren't the books. I mean, I can't tell you how mad I get when people ask me questions pertaining to the movies. I just tell them that they need to read the books cause the movies are shit compared to them.  I wish they never made them. I really do.  x0x
