I was lucky enuf 2 get a lift in and home with Hannah. :D The movie was better than I thought it would be actually. Good as the first. Loads of action. The end totally set it up for the next one though. Gemma tried to force me to eat lunch after, but I could only eat half my Twister. I had to stop or I would hav thrown up. I don't know what's wrong with me! Why can't I eat? Luke and I had to endure yet another few hours of unsubtle hints and "awwwwws", but you know, I'm sure they'll get over it soon. Right, right?! haha. Oh well. It's all worth it. Hannah W please don't hate me.
