She stopped as she saw her eyes gazing back,  So ruined were they, they almost looked black,  She missed the warm days of sunshine and singing,  She missed those sweetdays when her ears weren't ringing.   She splashed at the water and cried in the creek,  She wanted some strength,and she seemedso weak,  And the creek bubbled back, and it talked and it soothed,  And the girl was astonished, amazed, she was moved.   "Listen," it said, "listen, come here,  Why do you waste these coldbittertears?  Can't you see that each day is your own?  Can't you see that you're free to roam?  Why do you weep, girl,why do you cry?  Don't you see your wings, that you can fly?  Don't let them strangle you, girl, you can fight,  And, most important, don't let your goals out of sight."   To this speech she listened with care and control,  And inside she felt a strange, little pull,  She wanted to love, she wanted to live,  And instead of taking, she wanted to give.  She laughed til she cried and cried til she smiled,  Her whole thoughtful walk had been well worth the while,  And she bent toward the creek and gave it good thanks,  She kissed its waters and its green, glowing banks.  She glanced at the water, so light and so fresh,  And wondered how she could get out of this mess,  She stopped as she saw her eyes gazing back,  So full of mirth, of joy, and so black.   She left the waters, but her soul was still there,  No longer was she in deep, doomed despair,  For she bubbled like the creek, and was in love with each day,  And she became an old wise woman, a healer, a sage.  So when her patients are in pain and in tears,  She tells them totouch their deepest,dark fears,  And go to the creeks waters and look for perfection,  And they usually find that it is in their reflection.
