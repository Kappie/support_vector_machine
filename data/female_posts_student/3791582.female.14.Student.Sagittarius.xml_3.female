Yup, you shift right back into only child mode and it seems like things really were always like that. o well, a 7 year differnce sucks when your states (normally nations) apart. but u live, u deal, and have good times. with that said, cheers and bottoms up!.  ill probably write again later. gotta go get read to lay that mulch. HELLS YES! (no...not at all,lol)
