I also went to bible study. It was much fun.  Lalala..   Randomness...  I WANT THAT DRESS I would be perfect if I had it "Self-acctualized" Acctually..if i just focus on getting things that will make me "perfect" i will never be perfect. There is always something more. *sigh* HAPPY THOUGHTS Gosh, I rock.
