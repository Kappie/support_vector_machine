The whole cd is pretty good, acutally, but this one is just so darn catchy.  I am quite happy as I just got an extremely "yay" package in the mail from  urlLink Sephora  I think I might apply for a jobby there during the holiday season just for a bitchin' discount.   My face hurts because I can't stop smiling or thinking about you and I am so excited to see you tomorrow and I just wanted to thank you for the billionth time for reminding me how great it is when you're giddy like a little five year old.  :)   urlLink Trace Element  will be playing Thursday October 23, 2003 at the  urlLink The Thirsty Turtle  in Stamford.  Happy hour and rockin' eye candy?  You all better be there!
