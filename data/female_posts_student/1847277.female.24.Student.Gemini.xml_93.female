That's mostly because I felt terrible after class, so I came home and slept on and off, never getting out of bed until yesterday AM.  And last night I went out to dinner and then to a bar since some friends are leaving for the field today and won't be back until April, at which time I'll be gone.     Anyhoo, it's been a rather crazy past couple of days.  I'm trying to get my scheduling worked out so that I can leave early to vacation with Dave, and I have a lot of other errands/things that I'm trying to take care of.  Actually, I should get to work.  I'll try to post something more interesting later. : )
