We're going to someone elses house on sunday for supper apparently now too! lol... and I'm babysitting tomorrow from like 12:30 till 2:30.... it's good though cause if I can babysit for them a few times this summer I'll be able to make some money, which is awesome cause right now I have like none... none being like 30 bucks but still... not very much, I havn't babysat in such a long time... hopefully I'll get to more this summer cause I'd like some moola.  I'm tireddd it's like 10:30... that sucks... and I have to get off the comp soon or my dad will come home and like yell at me cause I was supposed to get off at 10 which is completely unfair... it's summer and I'm like almost 15 and I can't be on the comp past 10 like every night, it's so gay, oh well... at least I CAN get on the computer, plus I have it like most of during the day since I have NO life whatsoever.
