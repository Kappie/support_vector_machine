	 
      Don't look at me,
I see myself in your face.

Don't touch me,
Im full of poisonous thorns.

Don't speak to me,
Your words are worthless syllables.

Don't understand me,
You never knew me.

Don't pity me,
I pity you.

You left me,
I wither without you.

You taught me,
My reality now a nightmare.

You loved me,
Enough to torture me.

My father,
Is only my mother.
