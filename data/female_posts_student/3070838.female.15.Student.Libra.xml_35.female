For those of you who don't know, Courtney will be moving to Freer for the next 2 school years, then coming back her senior year.  Words cannot express how much I have connected with Courtney and she knows it.  I want to share some of our stories with you. :)   The Bathroom Story  Courtney and I were getting ready for tennis in the bathroom of the English hallway. We went in, and noticed that it, well, STANK. lol. It was bad, but I needed to change. So we went in and we were all like, "Oh man, I can't stand this anymore." and "God, somebody has a bad stomache." Finally, Courtney said "I can't take this anymore!" and left. I hurried to finish, and I was picking up my stuff from the corner of the bathroom, when a TEACHER walks out of the "stink-origin-stall". I just stood there, with my mouth open, grabbed my stuff and ran outside with Courtney. I told her, "Oh my god, it's a teacher!" and we were standing there making stupid faces (especially me lol, I had a suck face look on lol) and laughing when the teacher walks out, and says "How yal doing?"   Hmm... let's see. What's another good one... Well, there's the time Andrew was throwing dead mice at us when we were working on our Rube Goldberg? lol.   Oh, there's also the time when I ducked to miss Steffy's tennis ball (which she missed, and was coming right at me) and turned around and ran smack into Courtney's tennis racket- my eye was watering for a while.  Courtney has also had moments by herself- like the time when she was just walking across the room in Spanish, and wiped out- on her ass- flat out- for no reason.   We share many things- our favorite color: pink, some of our favorite songs: Say I Yi Yi, and some of our favorite artists: Britney? lol. :)  We also share some opposites- country music.  I know theres more great stories to share, so as I think of them (I'm gonna call her right now and find out!) I'll let you guys know.  TTYL, L8az,     ~*Phileda*~
