"if you keep cussing at me, i'll tell mom your secret."  nice blackmail you stupid litte fuck.  god. i have done so much around this house and i get no thanks for it. i dont do it for the thanks and kudos, but once in awhile it would be nice to hear a thank you or see caroline do something for once. stupid little bitch.  my mother is seriously unstable. she recently had me call doug again. she had written out this little script like she always does and has me use my minutes to lie to someone i love. she had me tell him she was dead. to get back at her, i sounded happily casual on the phone: "hey doug, its addie. um, yeah. my mom had a stroke this morning and died. ok. later! bye!" he called later and left a message saying he was confused. yeah, i would be too. i dont think i should have done it at all. i told her i thought she had crossed the line and the bitch got all pissed and defensive. she told me to read some of the emails she had written from my email address posing as me. she told me that maybe i would change my mind about what i think. i told her i know that she does that and that i dont appreciate her using my name and persona in vain. i hate that bitch. i will push her down the stairs and laugh the whole time.   hysterically.
