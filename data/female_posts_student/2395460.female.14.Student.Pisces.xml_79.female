It's the same stuff they've been selling at the  urlLink Air and Space Museum  for decades, as the "food of the future".    urlLink Funky Food Shop  has the full range of space snacks including  urlLink ice cream  and  urlLink strawberries . Also available are super caffeinated  urlLink Turbo Truffles  in flavors like Cosmic Coconut and Toffee Tornado.
