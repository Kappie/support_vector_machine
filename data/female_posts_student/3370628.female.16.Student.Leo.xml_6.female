All right, that's a lie, I do know why-- I was looking at blog layouts at  urlLink SoulKarma  and recalled that it's been a while since I've used my actual blog, located  urlLink here . Why was this? Well, because I'm too damned lazy to bother manually formatting each new post there.   I also have a blog of sorts at my  urlLink DeviantArt site . If anything, that is likely what I might use instead of this. *shrugs*  I may post later. TV is beckoning.
