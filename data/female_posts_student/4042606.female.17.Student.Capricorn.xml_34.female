I think everyone in Burlington, and now everyone that can get on the internet, has seen what happens when he drinks. I also want to let everyone know that I am personally feeling a lot better, and as you can see Ian is doing better. When I get back I will deal with the other problems. Anyway I am hungry and I am going to get some breakfast, so catch everyone later.
