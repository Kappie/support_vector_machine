Vietnam was fun with some not so fun times. Sooo much happened.. too much to write so i'll have to tell you all stuff about it another time! I just got back home yesterday. If anybody would be as obliging as to get me a jet that can take me to vietnam or from there back here in four hours without a bunch of babies crying continuously during the whole flight then you would forever be my savior.  hehe... geez you all write a lot! sorry i havent read every entry yet but i am caught up on the more recent ones! well i am weary so i shall leave you all with a tootles!!!  "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..."
