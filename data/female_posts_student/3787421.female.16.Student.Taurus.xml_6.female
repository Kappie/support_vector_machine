I don't have a lot to talk about I'm a little annoyed with some of my friends today because they made fun of what I believe in but yet if someone is mean to them for their choice I'm always there supporting them 100% and usually shouting abuse back and the rude people who are being mean it just doesn't seem fair why does life suck so much that this is what it comes down to what we wear doesn't make us who we are we make ourselfs who we are its not my fault people won't take the time to get to know me! and respect what I believe in...
