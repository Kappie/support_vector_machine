I'll stop there. I doubt it'll happen. In fact, I bet myself $5 it won't happen. How's that, huh?  Imagine the red car, the red car.   Wait, that's such a little whore of me, too. What would I do, really? Well. I have nothing to do that day. Hi Jean. I'm makin' you happy.  Today's Grandma's birthday, and Doupe's too. They've decided to have a party. On a Tuesday night. So I have to clean out the media room. I've started reading Cliff's. I hope it won't be impossible, or I sense a shitty day coming up. I don't really see how I can get work done tonight, but what do they care?  So now, the happy result is that I'm up, albeit still in a crumpled shirt and running shorts. I refuse to clean up. I still have fifty pages to go before I meet my quota. My mouth tastes slightly of toothpaste and my reactions are still slow. That was a lovely nap until I got yelled at, really.  I sense a generalization coming up, but I'll check myself. Good day to you all.
