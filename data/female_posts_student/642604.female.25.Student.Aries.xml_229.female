Tyla's parents came into town and took all of us out to dinner at a fairly nice restaurant and it was a great change of pace from my rice and noodle dinner I have been living off of lately.  I actually got to have salmon again.  They were the nicest people.  And I got to hang out with John and Abby again whom I met last week and they were fantasticly fun!  Then there was Tyla's roommate Meghan and her boyfriend Jeff.  The cool thing about Jeff is that he is actually from Annandale Virginia and so we discovered we knew many of the same people and that he was best friends with someone I went to church with forever, Dana.  It was nice to be able to talk to someone about things I knew about as opposed to just listening to people go on and on about things and places I've never had any knowledge of.  But anyway, so we go back to Tyla's apartment and drop off Meghan and Jeff and the rest of us make our way to the BU area of town.  We head to the Whitehorse which was fun and then left to go to The Kels, also fun.  At the Kels Tyla meets this guy, Kevin, who claims to know someone Abby knows and we're chatting with his friend and him and it's obvious Tyla likes the boy.  The next thing I know we are leaving and I hear we are going to this party that Kevin knows about.  Whatever.  So we drive Kevin to his car and Tyla decides to go with him, so we're driving now behind him in Abby's car to someplace that he says is like 2 blocks away.  Next thing I know we're pulling into some chinease restaurant parking lot and we're turning around.  We drive around and finally Kevin pulls into a store 24 and he is on the phone while John and I are in the car next to him and Tyla and Abby are in the store.  We both have our windows down because despite my quitting smoking I suffer set backs when drinking.  And low and behold Kevin is telling whomever he's talking to that he's on the way but has no idea where he is going and he's going on and on to some girl that he only wants to hang out with her.  So we go finally to this house and we pull up and get out.  Abby, John and I are sketched out right away but we go in against our better judgement.  I find a bathroom and when I come out everyone is outside and I go out and it is decided we are leaving.  So then we drive to Abby's friend's house not far from where I live.  At this point I am thinking that I am going to stay at Abby's house that night for lack of having something easier to do.  So we're at this friend's house and we're hanging out drinking, having a very good time but it is getting very late so we decide to go.  John, who is driving Abby's car, agrees to drive me home so as we're driving home I finally check my watch for like the first time that night and it's 4:00 in the morning.  God help me, so I roll into bed and fall asleep and then wake up sometime around seven a.m. craving water but instead I roll over and fall back asleep thinking I'd sleep a couple more hours... then I wake up at 2 in the afternoon and other than talking to Eric and my Mom on the phone I basically spend the whole day in my pajamas reading magazines and watching television.... productive day I guess....
