I ate then took a shower.  After my shower I worked on my Lit and Comp test which sucked by the way.  (homework in general sucks!)  I drove to Lewis around noon to mail a letter for my mom because we don't have an actual mailbox out here.  Apparently we aren't considered developed yet.  But yeah...came home worked on Lit and Comp some more and watched some tv in there.  Then I got ready to go to the Witness/The Spill Canvas/Kelpie show.  Although Becky came late and wanted to sit on the ledge but my chair was in her way so what did she do?  She picked up my chair with me in it and moved it.  Gosh if you would have gotten there earlier you wouldn't have to worry about where you're gonna park your fat ass!  Ugh...people piss me off sometimes!  Witness and The Spill Canvas rocked as always but Kelpie was not so good, I didn't like them.  The lead singer resembled a Red Neck so much.  He had overalls on with a red shirt and long hair with a beard.  I half expected him to take out a jug and start blowing into in and call for alligators.  There was this boy in a green shirt that played with Kelpie though.  He played the keyboard and guitar, he was hot!  He was hopable!  Witness was amazing.  I agree, Renae, Witness is better instrumentally but lyrically The Spill Canvas wins.  I wish Peter would turn around once in awhile and face the audience when he plays though.  I was disappointed that Nick didn't play The Tide too.  I love that song.  The line that goes, "Heaven's not a place you go when you die it's, that moment in life when you actually feel alive."  Aww...that just gets me.  Joe seemed more relaxed tonight than he did on Saturday.  Afterwards since it ended sooner then we expected it to and we told our parents we weren't gonna be home till 10:30, and we had no intentions of going home early, we just bummed around town.  We ended up at Wal-Mart. (I hate Wal-Mart) Then to Hy-Vee where we began a sandwich hunt and since the deli was closed on account of it being 9:30 we left and traveled to Burger King.  We ate at Burger King just fine but when it came time to leave we were locked in.  Leave it to Renae, Megan and I to get locked in a Burger King.  The nice guy that was working unlocked the door for us.  oh fun times.  Good night everyone and God Bless!
