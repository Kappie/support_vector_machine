I wanted to talk to a certain person, but never really had the right setting.  And I was sort of hoping for a reconciliation with another person, just to end the year properly (which never happened).  That being said, I still had a great time.  We went straight there early on, around 9:30-ish, hoping to eat pizza (which ended up being gross anyway) and get tanked on the free beer.  Mission accomplished!  I don't know how much I drank but I know that I definitely had like three shots, too...ewww, Jager, just remembering that makes my head spin.  Whoa.  Is my head really spinning?  I'm definitely hungover and I'll tell you one thing: I'm definitely drinkin' tonight!  Anyways, so I had a couple people confess their love to me and I definitely confessed my love to my "1L boyfriend," as I call him...all of which were rejected advances.  *sigh (for me)*  My friends (a couple) got in a fight 'cause some girl grabbed his face and kissed him on the cheek and she thought more was going to happen so she was freaked and left (don't blame her, he doesn't do anything to alleviate jealousy...I know, I used to date him).    Here's a snippet of an IM conversation that I had when I got home yesterday:  K (2:27:51 AM): and cause i'm REALLY drunk K (2:27:58 AM): i'll tell yo a secret K (2:28:02 AM): i really want you K (2:28:07 AM): i can still smell you on me K (2:28:14 AM): and it hurts that you're not here K (2:28:15 AM): oh well K (2:28:18 AM): i'm not that lucky F (2:42:20 AM): hi silly [snip] K (2:47:13 AM): you're hot, what can i say [snip] K (2:47:40 AM): look, i don't dance, and i danced with yo twice [snip] K (2:49:02 AM): you looked so good [snip] K (2:49:38 AM): g had to drag me to dance, and i ran to dance with you F (2:50:01 AM): Hahahahahaha, g is much cooler and hotter K (2:50:13 AM): noooooooooooooooooooooooo K (2:50:27 AM): i'd rather have yo K (2:50:33 AM): but i don't count F (2:50:39 AM): What are you talking about?

F (2:58:52 AM): well when do we run into each other? K (2:59:04 AM): some rare times. but i aim for those F (2:59:24 AM): i thought it was just normal coincidence K (2:59:36 AM): sometimes K (2:59:45 AM): but not alaways K (3:00:01 AM): i know i'm everyone's friend F (3:00:12 AM): you are K (3:00:15 AM): and no girl here thinks of me in a sexual or relationship sense K (3:00:22 AM): but deep down, i am a man K (3:00:27 AM): and i do have these thought [snip] K (3:32:00 AM): sweet dreams K (3:32:11 AM): and i was serious aout everythign i said [snip] K (3:44:16 AM): fuckin wish you were here  Oh yeah, let's look at another one: b (2:47:52 AM): hi F (2:47:58 AM): hi b b (2:48:04 AM): r u coming over F (2:48:13 AM): of course i'm not b (2:48:36 AM): why n ot F (2:49:23 AM): you totally were like naw b (2:50:34 AM): huhh? F (2:50:54 AM): You totally shot me down, it's aiiiight b (2:51:08 AM): FINE b (2:51:10 AM): laTer b is away at 2:51:15 AM.  F (2:51:27 AM): Are you kidding me?  Yeah, I was completely shot down...I took him into another room and I wanted to just kiss him but he was like, "No, we can't, we're friends," and led me out by the hand.  I dropped his hand and walked in the other direction.  So I got that IM whe I came home and I was like, "Uh, duh!"  Drama drama.  And I have yet to find out what happened with this random IM I got from my friend C when I woke up this morning: C (6:35:19 AM): OMG C (6:35:22 AM): I AM SO STUPID  So...that sums up the night.  I danced, I drank, I flirted, I ate, I worked the door (although I definitely didn't have to) and I had a good time overall.  Here's to more drunken debauchery tonight! ;)  Cheers!
