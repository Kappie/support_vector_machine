I don't blame her; she's called me more than three times and it's my obligation to anyways if I'm to play, period. Haha, I just don't know how to say it. She came with her sister, we did a runthrough. The usual awkward conversation that just makes you want to go off and hug someone or just laugh hard. Mom gets them tea. They ask me what I can play, they rack off a whole bunch of contemporary contemporary music--"classical" as we know it is going to the dogs. I can't play any, except to pick out some lame tunes. Then they ask me to play, I do a messy rendition of the Ravel (still under construction) and I don't know whether to feel stupid or that I've outsmarted them. Then Bach. And then practice again, and then adios. What am I to say? Define "boor" for me. But no, that word looks too menacing and outright mean.  So maybe tonight I understand some things better, but maybe tonight I don't want to understand them at all. Well, I asked for it, and this is what I get, and if I'm anything less than satisfied then I'm a spoiled brat. Well, more than one thing today has proven that. Somehow I just want to call "RETREAT," turn the army around and return home to someone. Someone I trust.  Thanks, A, for the CD. I'm still listening to it. Too bad it brings back too many icky, questionable memories, but I need to cope with it.  A watercolor day, friends in and out. Strange truths. True, though. And what more can I ask?
