I've decided I will create a "blog" as well, just cuz, ya know, I have nothing better to do but express my thoughts to anyone who will listen (And thanks for the idea. You know who you are). My thoughts as of this very moment: I really wanna go back home. I miss El Paso somethin' awful (as the Alabamans would say). I miss all my best friends, I miss my beau (or boyfriend, for those of you who are easily confused), I miss the crappy weather, I miss Chico's, I miss all of the ROTC drama. And Alabama just plain sucks. I've almost died twice due to tornados. And the people are so freakin' nice here, it's scary. and a life-long friend since 2nd grade has changed...completely. She's just very...ify. Like, I dunno, sometimes she just acts like she doesn't know what she wants. Other times, she's really overdramatic. Then there's my mom. We're actually getting along, and that's scary as well. We've NEVER gotten along, but now, we're shopping together! How scary is that? And as for my soon-to-be step-dad...well, I've never gotten along with him, and I don't intend to. He's weird, and nerdy, and a know-it-all. Plus, sometimes he tries to act like my dad, when in actuality, he's nowhere close. I've lived without a dad for more than 15 years, so just because he's the father of my sister doesn't give him the right to just move in and take over. And I thought it was really funny how, one day, while shopping for furniture for our new house, my mom just comes out with this: "So, what would you think of Arnold and I getting married?" Well, I didn't wanna ruin a good thing, so to avoid an argument, I just said "I don't care." "What do you mean you don't care?" she asked. "Just that, I don't care. Whether you get married or not, it really doesn't matter. You guys are practically married anyway, so the only difference will be a ring on your finger." Ha! I love it when I get the last word! I mean, I didn't mean to be such a smart-a$$, but, hey, that's just how it's gotta go.     So any-who, I must get going. I have such a full day tomorrow (puh-leeze). So look forward to the next post, coming to a theater near you!            Song of the Moment- "Pieces of Me"-Ashlee Simpson      Why?- It's a secret
