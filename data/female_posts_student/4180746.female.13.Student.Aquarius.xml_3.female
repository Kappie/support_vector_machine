Didnt talk at school for about 2 hrs for no apparent reason.....people always tell me to shutup but now that i did they wanted me to talk....weird people guess what i did? i didnt talk so friends tried to get me to talk by using every mean they had insulting my crush included which ws pissing off to say the least but i still didnt talk....willpowers working afterall..   Just walk down quietly, And pray to your god, Maybe your gods not alive, But wont he still hear u? Our holy blasphemy, Union of sins, So damn sacred, Your precious darkness, And the unholy grim, Takes hold of me and you, And it really wont let go, Beliefs of mine, Sacrilegious for you, Religion for me, But we keep on going , hand in hand, Its too late to return, Too late to take a stand, So lets lead on our doubts, And go where your god takes us, And mine.   yeah i know its crap but as you all know school has screwd my brains. so until we meetnext time byee byee!
