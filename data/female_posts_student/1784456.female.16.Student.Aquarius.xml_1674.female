But we had a good time, me anna, and tim. we did some shopping, and i bought the evanescence album, and then we did more shopping and then we had lunch, bought some sweets and went to the cinema and saw the new Peter Pan film *which isn't actually half as crap as it looks!* then we did more shopping and then we came home *sob* we had a good time tho. rite, i need ur help............wot shall i do for my birthday and when? cos i can't do it the saturday after my bday bcos those who r delightfully attatched (izzy, samantha.....) will want to be with their other halves that day bcos it is valentines day, sop that day is out of the question. and i can't have it the weekend b4 bcos then u'll have samanthas party one week and mine the next and i'll end up getting really crappy pressies cos none of u will have any money. So, i'm a bit bugared. I'm actually starting to think that maybe i shud just forget about my bday this year. *tho i dont think thats quite as easy as it sounds*. rite im blabbering again so im gonna shut up *again*. bye bye, c ya nice and early in skool tomorrow! xoxoxox
