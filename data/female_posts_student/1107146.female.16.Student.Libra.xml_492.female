I typed it fast and in fading sunlight, in a really akward position because the chair I'm sitting in is broke and it forced me to pull myself straight and stare down at the notebook which I wrote the sucker in, which is also irregularly placed, double-forcing my redesigned posture.  "I sink and then some." Kurt Cobain is Awesome.  YES.
