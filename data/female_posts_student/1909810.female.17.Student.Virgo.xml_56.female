You may have heard of it, or you may have not, but it was well done by NAU students and I must applaud them.  The Bald Soprano. If you ever get a chance, see it and hopefully whoever performs it does it justice. If you'd like to read it I've found a link:  urlLink The Bald Soprano (it should be exactly as written...i am hoping it is a link that provides the full script, i have not the time to read it now) very funny, I seriously almost peed my pants, tee hee.
