Even though we still beat them by like 50 points.   Non-Candid Quote Goodness:  “He smiled understandingly – much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced – or seemed to face – the whole external world for an instant, then concentrated on you with an irrisistable prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.” – F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby  “The snow came in a big white blanket./ It covered up some of the memories./ I had come home to recover./ The snow can be so cold sometimes.” –The Lyndsay Diaries, “A Farewell to Autumn”  “I promise this won't be another song about being alone but all I feel is regret/ and I can't find the nerve to pick up the telephone./ I was thinking about how it drives me crazy just to feel your hand in mine,/ and how simple that is/ and I've thought about saying no to hope/ but I have this funny habit of putting pictures up on the wall of you and me./ I know that priorities never understand reality/ and time never lends itself to those who are waiting on love./ But it is overdue that we should share this night and Grace,/ your smile is the only thing that keeps me breathing./ The hours pass by like minutes when I'm with you./ The hours pass like minutes in the rain./ So lets stand here in the rain forever.” –The Lyndsay Diaries, “Mixtapes and Memories  “Ride the railroad that drives the nails and write it down in your diary/ Because this is better than a photograph./ This isn't going to be another shot in the dark/ but only another step closer to seperation./ Remember not remembering?/ It all ends here sometimes./ Let's sit back, tip the glass, and say those were the days/ because this is where the sidewalk ends.” –The Lyndsay Diaries, “Where the Sidewalk Ends”  "I wanna write the perfect song and play it just for you." -Thrice, "In Years to Come"  “Time you enjoy wasting is never wasted.” –John Lennon  "The moment may be temporary, but the memory lasts forever."  "It is doubtful if God can use a person greatly until he has hurt him deeply.” –A.W. Tozer  “Time is on your side. Time has a way of proving the rightness and the wrongness of people’s attitudes.” –Dr. Vernon Browns  "She's searching through the stations for an unfamiliar song. And she pictures all the places where she knows she still belongs."-Sheryl Crow  "Nobody can be exactly like me. Even I have trouble doing it."  "Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end."-Semisonic
