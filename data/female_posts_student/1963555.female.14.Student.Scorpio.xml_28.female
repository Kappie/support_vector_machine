I just I'm not so sure of my loyalty to them, dare I say it. I will always love them and David is my all time favorite, stay up all night crying, space out all day smiling, jump up and down, scream out loud, I love you so fricken much, guy but I dunno I'm not feeling their music right now. I pray to the gods of music that I just wore out their cd (twice a day for 1 1/2 years). I just need a new Sp fix like their DVD mabey or a new song/cd. I will always love them!  3) Reset- They frickin rock. I dunno what it is. Speed metal, rock, punk? Whatever it is I'm in love with it!  4) Blink-182- I dunno I'm feeling a blink tribute comin on.......  5) Avril.... Just kidding lol I don't know man....... uhhh I'll get back to ya  Movies:  Worst 1) The Good Girl- it's not that it was bad but so depressing. Oh my god I cried it was so horrible 2) House of a Thousand Corpses- I love horror movies but his was more like a fuckin torture movie. I thought it would be gore/susspence but he had to have been fucked up and druged on somthin good to come up with all this horrible darkness. 3) Charlie's Angles 2- I didn't actually see it but is there a difference between sexy and slutty??? Best 1) I don't know 2) too many good ones 3)I need to work on my report! BYE!
