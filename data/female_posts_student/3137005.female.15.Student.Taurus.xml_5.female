Today I have had my hair cut, it's just on my shoulders and it is layered, and looks like i have copper highlights in Kirsty's living room, but not my bathroom at home which is odd. I also went horseriding which was as always v. fun! I had to ride without stirrups again today, and now my calves hurt very much from keeping my heels down and my toes up without the help of stirrups, also my stirrups were way to long, coz the person who rides before me changed them to 11 and not 9 holes down. Silly woo woo!!! I'm now at kirsty's, we managed to blow up a bag of rice in the microwave, coz i thought kirsty had put holes in it, and she thought that I had put holes in it, so it blew up and we had to pick all the rice of the microwaves door, it was v.funny, coz her parents walked in just as we started cleaning it up. WE Bad? well i can't say my bad can I? We have actually revised, which is good, History-Public health, and Physics forces and motion. She introduced to the programme Charmed, and it is very very good, kinda like Buffy, maybe that's why I like it! Coz I love Buffy!!! They also play corrs alot in that programme, which i like a lot. Twice in one programme, I mean wow!!!!  I also showed kirsty my new fav song , which is add it to your playlists.   Even Better Than The Real Thing-U2.   All for now Dani
