I was wondering if its possible to delete an entire blog? Anyway enough of that... I have started writing my farce of a movie with my friend at work - who has gone to kalgoorlie for 3 whole months.. work is gonna be so damn boring without her. I'm hoping that the movie turns out to be as funny as it feels like it is at the moment - no doubt it probably wont come to fruition like a lot of things.. but its fun to dream! Back to uni again and its not too bad,  YET ! Got a fairly good timetable.... I almost missed a lecture today that was at 10am - yes I know i should have been out of bed a long time before that but i knocked my alarm when it went off and i turned off the snooze! Haha - I only happened to wake up because my housemate got a taxi and i heard her shut the door! It was quite amusing because as I was driving to uni - cos it was too late to catch a bus i went right past the exit on the freeway!  Preoccupation  is not something that should be practised whilst driving! Nevermind I got there in the end if not a little wet and windblown - but Just in time would you believe? And My promising start to the semester has begun with me already going to the library and studying! I have to go to trainging tonight and the weather outside is not pretty at all... no fair :( However I have to go tonight as I am wagging on friday to go to Billys brother's play - but we havent got tickets yet so I'm wondering if this will actually happen at all...? ALl will be revealed in the next edition of This - my life!
