Now, I am not off into any adventure this summer, so it took me about three weeks to figure out why exactly I needed to have this blog.  I have been, however, quite busy trying to put together a research project that has taken a huge amount of my energy in the past 5 weeks and it is a totally new experience for me.  So I decided, why not a blog where I can rant on about my frustrations and gains through the process of researching, or better yet, learning to reseach? And so, I figure I can justify my very own blog in the fact that I am going to drive myself crazy unless I have an outlet to vent out while working on this project.  Plus, I figure if I rant long enough about something, maybe some really break through ideas for the project may come to mind.  That would be awesome. As of yesterday, I felt as if I had already lost the battle with research before it had even begun.  I had been fairly warned that while doing research some of the most common feelings would be dispair and frustration.  I guess people can pre warn you all they want, but it really doesn't mean anything until you truly experience it on your own shoes.  So it hit m about a week ago and I was ready to quit when David Hall called up a "cohort meeting" of sorts to have everyone who was interested in sharing their own experiences come up and speak up their minds.  A total of four of us showed up and as soon as everybody else started speaking I realize that I was by no means the only person feeling at an absolute loss.  In fact (not that this is a good thing), there were a couple people that were almost worst off than I was!! So, I left the meeting feeling MUCH better and that was followed up by yet another great meeting with my mentors today. This is why I decided today would be a good day to start up a blog.
