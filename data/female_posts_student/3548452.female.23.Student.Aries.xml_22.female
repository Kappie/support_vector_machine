I just want to let you know now, if you actually read my blog before I posted this, and STILL felt that way, you're pretty stupid. If you think that after the total idiotic display you gave yesterday that I will still want to talk to you, maybe even be your girlfriend, you have got your head screwed on wrong... totally wrong. IF- 1. I've seen your penis on cam, 2. I've seen pictures of you naked, 3. we've discussed having sex (with the exception of one person and I will tell him who he is personally 'cause there was no pretenses with him), or4. you've tried to get me to come "see you" and we've just met, LET ME TELL YOU THAT IT AINT GONNA HAPPEN. I dont know what sick world you come from where all women are sluts and like to be treated as such, but just because you tell me you "dont do one night stands" or "if you sleep with me you have to be with me" does not mean that I'm going to be your woman OR sleep with you for that matter. You have got to be seriously fucked up in the head to think that I would ever degrade myself by doing that. OH, and for you guys out there that think that telling me how great you are in bed is going to get me to ask you for sex? Save you motherfucking breath. There is a limit to how concieted you can be and still remain on my good side. You know who you are, QUIT PUSHING THE ISSUE. I'm tired of hearing about how all these girls are chasing you and whatnot- my ex used to tell me that, tell me all about his "harem of girls"then practically beg me to come over and sleep with him. You know what I told  him?  GO ASK ONE OF YOUR HAREM GIRLS. If they're so hard up for sex that they need to beg you for it, why dont you tell them all about how great you are, 'cause I dont care to hear about it. There has never been, and will never be a guy that makes me want them that bad. NEVER. I dont get "sprung" so you're wasting your time trying to make me want you. I've had enough good boyfriends to far outweigh the bad, as well as guy friends that have been good to me. I know just how good I am at what I do, so I dont need to brag. If I do, it's only because you are and I'm sick of you thinking that you're the only one who's been labeled a "golden child," as a friend of mine put it. You wanna know what I'm looking for in a man? Someone who's honest. Who doesnt try to talk himself up to make himself look so much better than any other man. Show me you're something, I dont wanna hear it- especially if you're trying to not have that kind of relationship with me. My problem has been finding the nice guy after he's met the evil bitch that made him hate women or at least, not want to settle down with anybody. Then here I come, I open them up, and they go off and meet somebody else and settle down with them. I'm sick of being the go-between for your better outlook on life. I wont lie and say I'm not spoiled rotten by the guys that are around, but it's not because I use them either. It's because I'm a real woman, and I know my place, my role, whatever you want to call it. All you feminist jerkoffs that wanna bash me? I'm not saying that I'm submissive in my relationships, only that I know from experience and observation how not to be. I've never been hit, never been mistreated (besides some verbal and mental stuff, but I can handle that far better than being hit), and I get told on a daily basis how much I am loved, how wonderful I am, and how beautiful I am. All you people that think otherwise, or wanna play games with me, you dont bother me. I dont need your approval or you to want me to feel like I am special. I know I am special, I know that there is no woman that is quite like me, for I am unique. I know I may put myself down, but that's me. The minute you begin to think that I have low self esteem and that I take your perverted and rude comments as a compliment is the minute I get a big laugh out of you. It aint happenin boys, if you dont like it, delete me off your list, tell me to delete you off mine and we'll be allllllllright, right? *big grin*
