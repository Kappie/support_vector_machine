(There's a possible spoiler coming up, so if you don't know the story and mean to see the play, stop here.) An important moment in the plot is when a character announces she is pregnant, and considering having an abortion. In fact, she tells her mother-in-law, she's already put $5 down with the local abortionist. It is a dramatic moment. And you know as you watch it that when this play came out in 1960 it was received by the audience as a painful moment--a cry of pain from a woman who's tired of hoping that life will turn out well.   But this is the thing: Our audience didn't know that. They didn't understand it was tragic. They heard the young woman say she was about to end the life of her child, and they applauded. Some of them cheered. It was stunning. The reaction seemed to startle the actors on stage, and shake their concentration. I was startled. I turned to my friend. "We have just witnessed a terrible cultural moment," I said. "Don't I know it," he responded.   Perhaps I'm not the best audience for this because I am pro-life.  But as I've said before, I can understand the pro-choice position, and even respect it.  This is where I am different than so many on both sides who get caught up in the rhetoric.  I understand that it is a difficult issue.  Others refuse to accept that.  So much of the language of the pro-choice movement simply refuses to acknowledge that the choice it is advocating might in fact be a difficult one.  I suspect for most people who choose to have an abortion, it turns out to be one of the most difficult decisions of their lives, and I hardly see the danger in admitting or acknoweldging that.  It would give the arguments for choice a lot more credibility.    But this is not the case.  It is seen in this account Noonan provides.  Cheering for the ability to make the choice may be perfectly valid, but cheering for the choice itself, or even worse, for the agonizing decision making process that a woman has to go through in order to make that choice is simply misguided.  It is not a good thing to have to make that choice.  It means that something is wrong, it means that a woman is ill, or that the baby is ill, or that the family can't afford any more children, or that the woman was raped, or the victim of incest, or that she is only 13 years old.  Most of the times when the woman is presented with the choice (assuming, of course, that abortion is not just another method of birth control), it is a stark and bleak future she faces either way she chooses.  It is not a situation to be taken lightly, to be applauded.  It is a situation to be thought upon, so as to avoid it in the future; it is a situation to be mourned.
