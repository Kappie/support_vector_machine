It was fun at the time honestly but I was one mean kid in 8th grade. Not mean in the sense that I had no friends and I was just hostile and bitter but mean as in, I'd scheme with other people to get back at people or even get people who didn't even do anything to us in the first place. Not good times. Not at all. I feel really awful. Everyone I knew that was older than me, I thought changed for the worse in high school but I think I've definitely changed for the better. I don't just go along with stuff I don't agree with anymore. I'm a lot stronger. I couldn't care less usually what people think of me. I suppose it depends on the person but with most people...eh. I can't be bothered to care.   I think I was also trying to be ghetto in eighth grade or something. I was looking at our, "notebook" that we passed around in our group and wrote notes and stuff in so that everyone could read a note if we had something to say to everyone, and I definitely started a note like, Yo homies, wazzup?" *Shudder*Scary times, scary times. Haha...speaking of "ghetto" that song from Office Space just randomly came on. "It feels good to be a gangsta."  Anyway, after that ummm...nice? little interlude into the past, I went out with Chris. Fun times. :) I think I've decided about something too. I told Chris. He doesn't believe me. :P Haha. I guess I'm not surprised. I don't think I'd believe me either. I have to do one more test and then I'll know. Even I'm questioning what I say.   So, after I hung out with Chris, I went to dinner with my family and now...I'm home. :) YaY, good times.   I'm talking to Mary Clare about the whole Michael Jackson thing. Honestly, I don't know if he's guilty. He seems almost so psychologically messed up that he wouldn't think it's wrong to have a sleepover with eight year old boys.   Anyway, I think I'm going to go watch this program on the Inquisition on the History Channel International. Hah. I'm SUCH a dork.
