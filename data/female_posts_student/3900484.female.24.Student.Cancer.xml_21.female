We have lost a snake, a kingsnake to be exact, and he was spotted and grabbed today, but he is much too smart for us, apparently.   Before D could get him out, which I was attempting to help with, he snuck back up to the top of the compartment that he was peeking out of.  So he is still missing.  Momentarily.  He's in the display case, at least, and we don't think he can escape out to the rest of the nature center.   I am so disappointed to see more of  urlLink this type of news .  He makes me so angry with everything he's done.  I am so not political, normally, but I can not stand to deal with this man anymore.  I don't want to see his face and I don't want to hear his stupid remarks, and I don't want to have him elected again.  I think I might have to move, if it happens.  Here I come Canadia.
