But i feel a bit empty today, i guess if things are meant to be with Jason then they will happen, doesn't mean i want someone else to come along, because i'm just not in the mood for them to be honest. I don't know why i bother attempting to talk to Laura, she just patronises me, thinking shes always right, and shes so smug that she has the something i want, i know she is.  She just thinks shes better than me, shes not. Been talking to Ami about going swimming and joining a gym, give me some independance too i think...  Been thinking a lot about A Levels and results and Uni etc, its all looming up so fast and i just don't know what to do or even think right now. Just want to relax and i can do that soon, holidays in two days...  ~Lisa~
