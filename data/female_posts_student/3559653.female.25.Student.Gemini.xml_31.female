It was a lot of fun, as it always is, and really good to see everyone! Andrea and Joey came too, and we all had a good time. Tabi  Holly wanted to draw stuff on my arms  hands and they went nuts when I let them (as you can see in this picture)! Luckily it was all done with washable markers, though I did have to pick up a prescription from the mall with my arms  hands looking like this lol! urlLink
