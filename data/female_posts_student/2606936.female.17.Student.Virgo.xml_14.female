These are: my grandmother's engagement ring, my class ring, my sapphire ring, 2 Nominations bracelets, and a watch.   The other day i was taking them off before bed and my grandma's ring fell off the dresser. I heard it hit wood, so i knew it had fallen into one of the two open drawers below. However, i dug through them and couldn't find it.  Tonight, after work, i finally pulled the  two drawers out and dumped all the clothes out. These were my two "main" t-shirt drawers. The top one has mostly cute, tiny little shirts i wear all the time, and the bottom is mostly the big souvenir t-shirts i wear to sleep and practice and stuff.  Digging through the first one,  i found two GHP shirts i hadn't worn in months. GHP, if you don't know, is an AMAZING summer program i went to last summer. Basically, high school sophomores and juniors are nominated in one school subject, anything from math to art to German(as I was) to dance. You go through a series of auditions or interviews, paring the number down to a lucky 675 that get to go spend the summer on a college campus, studying their subject. There are no grades or tests or anything. You learn only what you want, and everyone there has a love for learning. It is also a once-in-a-lifetime experience, because you can only go as a student once.  GHP changes people. It makes you hate the stupid people in your school even more, for one thing. You get used to the freedom, to being trusted and praised. You get used to only studying what you love. You get used to the friends that are all worth knowing, that are all intelligent and talented. People leave and find their old friends too shallow, or end up breaking off pre-GHP relationships because of how they've grown more than their partner.  I should have broken up with The Schnig while I was there. I did, actually. I thought i was gonna be ok. But he called me back at 3:00 AM and begged. It was sweet. I took him back.  Several months later, he dumped me and broke my heart. It hasn't healed yet. We haven't spoken in weeks. We haven't had a real talk in MONTHS.  Anyway, at GHP we made t-shirts at the drop of a hat. There was one for each hall students lived on, one for each major class(German), and one for each minor class - you chose one other subject to study. I took a Brass minor, since i play French horn. I also got the t-shirt for Pink Appreciation, which was a tongue-in-cheek organization celebrating the fabbity-ness of the color pink. They had shirts for the Homosexuality and Society discussion group, which i wish i had gone to so badly. I am probably the worl'ds leading straight fighter for gay rights. I think i was probably afraid of seeing that side of my friends, though - the side that condemns certain people being able to fall in love. Or else I was spending too much time on the phone with the Schnig. But people made shirts for IB, for Asian Pride, for anything and everything.   It's incredibly fun to wear them because no one understands the inside jokes, except sometimes the handfuls of school-people who went. You pass in the halls and have an instant bond, a nod at their shirt, because they understand, even if you've never really talked at all.  GHP was amazing. There are times when someone reminds me of it and I miss it so much I literally start to shake. I wore the German shirt to Nixie's sleepover this past weekend. That one isn't as great because it's in German, so people would rather say "een goot klaze abber een bibshun kamch" and laugh maniacally at their cleverness, than ask me what "Eine gute Klasse, aber ein bi√üchen KOMISCH" means.  (FYI, it's "A good class, but a bit ODD(funny, strange, etc)"- "komisch" literally means "funny" but it has a connotation of being somewhat off, weird, whatever. Thanks for asking.)  I think i'll wear my brass shirt tomorrow. We're starting school again after break and I'm going to need it to give me some confidence with all the stupid gossipy little asses there.  Not to mention the Schnig.
