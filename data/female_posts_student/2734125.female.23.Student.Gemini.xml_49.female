This rant is to:  A: Organize my thoughts B: To follow our assignment (write on research) C: Just to write  Creating diaries is an old hobby.  According to one of my sources (and I had library women looking, there aren't a ton oddly enough) the habit of writing about yourself and the banality of your day has been going on for hundreds of years.  This is an old genre.  Diary comes from the Latin diarium or "daily allowance" and journal comes from the latin diurnus or "journey".  Originally most dairies were ledgers, hence daily allowance.  While western society has only been doing diaries for so long, with Pepys being the first popular diary author (200ish years ago), Oriental cultures have been doing it much longer with the Pillow Books of the Japanese courts.  Journaling is a rather recent phenomenon, being created as a genre for women to write and process their feelings.  In the 1960s Tristine Rainer wrote  The New Diary  all about it.  Its gotten better and better, and now everyone has one.  Maybe not everyone, but it is a socially accepted way of processing emotions and understanding your "true self".  (all found at wikipedia.org/wiki/diaries, a very cool encyclopedia that is free online and was most useful in my research... Reliable?)  I personally have been journaling for a solid ten years, and find it very useful.  Journaling for me provides an outlet, a sounding board, a place to process and a possible chance that someone someday will find my words and listen...   Weblogs are a much more recent event in our history, only being about six years old- though some geeks (in the loving sense of the term) would argue that as long as there has been internet there has been people posting about their inane lives.  Truly that is splitting hairs, because the meat of it came when people started to take notice in a mass way- and boy did they.  In an April 4th article on blogging in the Guardian the author did a google search on 'blog' and got 29,7000,000 hits.  I did it just now and 33,600,000 hits.  In other words, the world of blogs is increasing a an amazing rate.  Now, its true that many of those blogs are now defunct- when many people get board of a blog they simply move on, leaving an open link that is not getting updated (like some of the ones in our class that I have tried to visit and still have first memories as the only entry)- but even given that, its a hell-of-a-lot of online journals.    There are a wide variety of blogs on the internet.  One of the reasons that journalism is interested in blogs is that many of the political sites have put pressure on main stream media to give more coverage to important events.  This was the case when Trent Lott made his classic racist remarks- Joshua Marshall, who runs talkingpointsmemo.com, is said to be responsible for forcing the media to sit up and take notice (from Wired, Dec 23 2002).  Other people use blogs as art, blogs as rants, blogs as cute displays for their pets- the list goes on and on, as we have often witnessed in class.  People still use online journals in much the same way that they used private, pen and paper, old-school journals, however, the movement from a text based forum, and a widely regarded private forum, to an electronic and public forum, has done some strange things to the diary/journaling genre.    In the 2003 three article "Teaching an Old Genre New Tricks: the Diary of the Internet," published in Biography, Laurie Mcneill did an excellent job of laying out some of these shifts.  Laurie, who is a historian who specializes in the use of diaries, explicated many of the similarities and differences.  For example, the online blog borrows heavily in format from the old diary, using dates that move in a chronological way, and being made in entries.  the blog is still talking about peoples lives for the most part, and what is important to them.  She points out that blogging and diaries are both viewed as a narcissistic waste of time by some people.  Both a journal and a blog seem to create a reader and writer pact, in which the reader is able to act as a conduit for the confessions of the writer, and the reader trusts the author to be presenting some form of an authentic self, but more on this aspect later.   There are also some differences, and some shifts that are key to note.  A blog has the ability to create communities, through linking between blogs and interactive texts (comments, email, and favorites links).  A blog is fluid- it can be changed at the will of the author without any trace of a change having been made.   These next two points are really important, so read carefully.  A blog acts as a blur between reality and virtual reality.  Finally, a blog, or the space of the internet itself, acts as a private/public space which can let a person either take on a persona, or take off a persona at their whim (I call this the Superman effect, but that too will have to wait till later on in the text).    So, I read this article, and some of the articles she read to create this article, and several other articles that were less impressive but offered a few good points, and thought, "now what?"  Well, I wanted to write a techno-ethnography, yes?  So, now that I have some idea of what people are saying about this genre of blog, does it apply to my own writing?  Is all of this connected to my experience as a blogger out in the ethernet trying to be heard?  I think so, and I think that I have something to add on top of it.  the oddest thing about my reading was that none of the authors that I picked up happened to be bloggers themselves, or if they were, they chose to omit the fact.  that means that I am an insider, and that I can explain, compare and contrast, some of the motivations that I have cycled through to get to this state (what that state is, I cannot say yet, hence the 'this').    Okay, now I am at an impasse- its 12pm, and I could be going to sleep, but I am oddly perky and not tired.  However, there are several reasons to stop writing.  The first is that this entry is already too long- and I do think about my audience, and I do want this to be read (two things that are important to us narcissistic bloggers).  Second, If I get into the part where I am looking at my own work it could be a long entry, and I am already feeling like I have met the goals set out so kindly at the top of this entry: I do feel more organized, like I have a solid base that I can work from in my own piece, that I have written about my research, and that I have written.  There we go.  So here is the candy for those who skipped the long stuff above, though I did try to make the above writing palatable:  Nothing exciting has happened to me today, truth be told.  All that stuff that you either just skipped or read- that's pretty much the whole of it.  I woke up, I read a few chapters about Rasputin, I did some online research on blogs and role playing, I went to the library and did more, I went and printed stuff, I came home and did reading, and then came here and posted.  At one point I went to get some food too.  That really is it.  Let me think about something fantastically daring to tell you... something revealing and worth the wait... I'm a Gemini?... no, that's no good... that I like to do yoga?.... boring... that I used to have a cat that would sit on the sill above the stairs and reach down a paw and scratch you as you came up?.... no....that I'm really a forty two year old man that is thinking about a sex change and is trying on the personality, that is really inside of me, of a slightly jaded, but overall happy, 22 year old graduate student?... doesnt ring true... how about this: when I am thinking about something really hard, or am distracted by doing some detailed physical work, like beading or weaving or what not, I will stick out my tongue ever so slightly, and then become conscious of it and pull it in, and about thirty seconds later it will all repeat itself.  Thats it- the best I could do today, still, don't we all feel better with a little self disclosure?  I wonder if that was sarcastic... I really can't tell.... something to think on... as well as my use of the thought pause dots... over used here a little I think... now its just automatic though...there is also an error in this text (or several, but if you read often you're likely used to it) that I cant find, so forgive me and fill in the right word for me, k?... sleep well...
