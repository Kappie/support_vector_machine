I have a new friend that is totally awesome and I just love even talking to him- even though it kind of surprises me everytime he calls me 'cause I'm not used to guys doing what they said they would do. Things are pretty great. I have a couple new friends in my life that I'm happy for... um, one in particular (you know who you are) I um, had fun with you and I think maybe we should hang out again soon *winks*.... I think that this is the calmest week I've had in a long time... I dont even feel like really man bashing this week 'cause I've met some awesome guy friends lately and they rock. Now, bout the time I say this, one of them will drastially screw up and leave me to man bashing again. Allright the weekend... I was kinda out of it yesterday, jitters and all. Why is it that the wonderful, awesome, down to earth guys always like somebody that is going to use them? I have so many guy friends who are just totally awesome and they get with these girls - some of them KNOWING that they're gonna get used, and then wanna cry to me when it happens. Not all of yas cry to me- so dont take it personal. But I have soem really awesome guy friends- and I'd really like to hook them up with my female friends that I meet, but jeez... they are stuck on these bitches they know they cant have and then wonder why when I come around I wont date any of them. Sure... I wanna be with a manwhore. Not. Well then there's the whole issue of the ones that I see doing it and then I see the person they're with- or that girl is a friend of mine... once the shit turns sour, then they wanna try talkin to me. Now, I'm glad to be your friend, but I definitely do NOT wanna date you in that case. If I'm friends with the woman, then we just cant go there... It's not "couth" as my ex-hubby (I'll explain in a few) used to say. When was I married? I wasnt... Tony is this guy that I was totally infatuated with but never actually went out with. But, for all intents and purposes when we were at the bar, I was his "wife" as he said. Anyway, I never claimed to be gorgeous or anything like that, but i know I'm cute, I know I'm damn sexy and I know I'm a good woman and an excellent friend. What else do I need to know? Nothing. There isnt anything you can say to me that will make me feel any less about myself. I love being me and that's all there is to it :D I guess since I've decided to make this the story of my life- truly uncut I can say who it is I'm crushing on. My friend Tab. I know, I know... that's complicating things if she's the type to get all wierd about it, but hey, I like her. So what? That's the way I feel. As for my relationship situation? I never seem to just have one guy I'm interested in... when I get interested in one person, three more (at least) come out of nowhere and I have a dilemma on hand. I was looking for something to wear for Halloween... went to Hot Topic's website and found more than just something to wear- other things too. The link is down there for those that wanna see just what I'd buy if I shopped at Hot Topic- the dress on the bottom- maybe something like a vampire bride or something is what I'm thinkin... who knows? Right now, I'm enjoying all that is going on for me. I love ya all.  urlLink http://www.hottopic.com/wishlist/viewSomeonesWishList.asp?W=479802
