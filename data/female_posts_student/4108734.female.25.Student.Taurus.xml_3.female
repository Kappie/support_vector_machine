One has to at least make pretense that one's brain is not going to implode.  And really, making animal noises is not the appropriate way to deal with frustration.   How childish, really!  But sometimes I just moo anyway.  I do find it amusing that one of the sources of my frustration is a professor that I have yet to meet.  Interesting how life in this advanced age  progresses ...  On a lighter note, my glorious career at the illustrious Russ's Market on 33rd and Highway 2 is about to end this Thursday.  Oh, there will be joy.  Oh, there will be dancing.  And perhaps some PopRocks and silly string.  Who knows!  I hope to emerge unscathed, but there have been rumors and rumors of rumors among my ever-eager gossiping coworkers about a certain young man with a crush on me waiting to "make his move."  Good LORD, give me wisdom.  What on earth do you  DO  with situations like that, anyway?    Tonight I took two IQ tests.  Never having taken one before, I was a bit concerned that my stupidity that I'd concealed for so long would finally be revealed.  A sigh of relief!  Both scores are considered in the "gifted" range, and the average of the two is a 137.  Equipped with this new information about myself, I will now proceed to conquer the known world!  I probably should finish school first.  If you want to know your IQ, you can go  urlLink here  or  urlLink here .  Personally, I prefer  urlLink this  test.  Tee hee!  Speaking of intelligence, my fall classes begin Monday, a week from today.  Well, yesterday, technically, since I'm writing this in the wee hours of the morning.  I have never been so excited to go back to school after a summer.  Don't ask me why.  Maybe it's because I'm almost done?  Maybe it's because I'm so excited about my Russian class?  All I know is that this next week would be torturous if I wasn't already working 60 hours.    This week I have been thinking rather seriously about starting up a Bible study again, but I'm not exactly sure what that would be like.  I want balance, but I don't want boring.  And I'm not sure that I should even call it "Bible study" as that's not necessarily what I have in mind.  Maybe I'll blog more on this later when I've organized my thoughts into a more comprehensible mess.
