Jesus, You're the author of my heart Told me you wanted every part Now my life and it's demands Are resting safely in your hands. And I can hear your voice inviting: "I'm here I never leave your side My stubborn weary child I am still here Please let me lead you on Your race is already won I am your God."  -Leigh Nash, "You're Here"  From City on a Hill
