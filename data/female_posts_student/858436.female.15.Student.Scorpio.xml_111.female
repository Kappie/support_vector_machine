Downtown Auburn is absolutely adorable, with all these cute cafes and awesome little boutiques. The next day we saw Auburn the college, and the campus was gorgeous, although somewhat small. Then that night we left for Tuscaloosa and we're still here, and I'm posting from the hotel's free computer hehe. Today we went and saw the University of Alabama, and I am VERY impressed. It is an awesome university. I am seriously considering this place. The campus is huge and state of the art and all this new construction is going on. The sororiety houses are beautiful. Tomorrow we're leaving for Baton Rouge, LA and then we'll see LSU on Thursday and then spend a few days down there. I'll be back on the 8th. Have a great time, don't get into too much trouble, and don't miss me too much! Hahaha. See ya peeps.
