Yesterday, Susie came over at freaking 9 am before a meeting for a club. We went to the summit for shopping, and I got one of those yummy frappichino things from starbucks jessie always gets before school. Then we had the meeting for Shakers, which is like SALT, but I don't know what we do besides promote SALT. For those of you who don't know, SALT stands for service action leadership team, which is a seniors-only club. I went and saw the Village last night too. It was really weird. I didn't know anything about it going in, so I'm not sure if it was suposed to be scary or not, but the beginning feaked me out, but halfway through I guessed the ending. Today I went with my parents to pick my sister up from girl scout camp, so that was a fun 4 hours in the car with my family and the dog. After that, Susie came over and "helped me make cookies" and we had pizza at our newspaper advisor's house and talked about plans for next year. It was a lot of fun. "our" cookies were really good and I hope I get my own collum next year, but I doubt I will. We'll see. The meeting didn't acomplish a lot, but I laughed for the first time in a while and it was fun. I still really really want to go to the zoo. Oh yea, I have some pictures if you want to see:   urlLink http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/babygirl05911/my_photos  I hope that link works.
