I also went to the fair, which turned out that it was the same as every other year. I thought it might be different with the whole 150th anniversery or something. But no. I mean don't get me wrong I had fun. But it was kind of dissapointing that all the "new" rides were the same old rides with different names. Like they expect us not to notice. HA.  Man I spent a lot of money. And I lost my Hulk, still not quite sure how I did that.   I also got my brown belt. My testing went pretty well, and I'm really excited about this belt. It's pretty high and my form is really fun so far.   Well break ended today and man did I feel it. Schoolwise it wasn't such a bad day but man the high school social life isn't easy. I'm really starting to hate this school more and more. The worst part is a good chunk of it is the people. I'm just so sick of them all. I mean there are exceptions and I love all my friends but I just don't feel like there are that many people that I'm actually gonna miss after high school. I feel like I know everyone and I've made all the friends I'm gonna make and I'm just stuck. I want a change. I need a change. A guy would be nice. Someone that doesn't go get a girlfriend on me. I feel like my heart was ripped out and put in a blender......Well not quite but I like the way that sounds. And it's not that far off. I think that's from two of a kind. Girls in general are dumb. All the sterotypes are right. Boys just cause grief. O well now I'm just rambling. Sigh.....I've been doing that a lot lately.
