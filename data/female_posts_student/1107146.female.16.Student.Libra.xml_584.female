It looks like a zombie-thing, it's badass.  And I haven't made a long post in a while, so I felt compelled to do so. Let's begin.  Familial problems springing up again. It's hard to explain where they're all coming from. You think you have a feeling beat, but it decides to reincarnate and spring up on you. If I hear one more thing about Jennifer I'm going to kill myself.  School's ok. I passed US History, I can't complain. Barely, mind. But I frick'n did. The test damn near gave me a seizure at first sight, but it was alright, as well.  I had fun last night on a treadmill, and about made my heart explode. I even fell off at one point, I don't think anyone saw tho, except my mom who was right next to me. And I was simultaneously watching something really smutty on VH1, but I couldn't hear it since my headphones weren't working. It appeared very smutty.  But I kicked the crap out of a punching bag while I was there. And had fun with a medicine ball. My mother made me sterile with said ball, which wasn't too thrilling...she overthrew just a bit. At least I made a funny deflating noise as I was unusually castrated.  Altho today I was reminded of the little plastic baby I had to take home in 8th grade. You know...the ones that cry and you put the keys in their backs, et cetera...and I was forced to wonder if maybe it was a gift that I was rendered incapable of reproduction. But no. It didn't happen, nor do I hate children or not want a family someday.  My hair is annoying. I've been thinking about getting it cut a lot lately, but knowing that I won't. I just wish the bangs would grow a bit more so that 1. I wouldn't have to trim it to mullet length for a while so as to get bangs, and 2. so that I could have a ponytail, so that conversations and consuming wouldn't consisting of me spitting out hair every three seconds.  Yesterday was the 25 year anniversary of Pope John Paul II. THE POPE!!! In Stout's class today, someone wrote, "The Pope is Dope!" on the board, and Julian stapled a sign on her message board that reads, "Got Pope?" I have one of those signs, it's going in my room somewhere. I feel bad for John Paul...he's probably the last of the fully pious left, and he's about to buy the farm.   To the best of us...  I've been trapped in my room lately. Mom's on the phone all the time (a serious hinderance to Abby Time, by the way), and Kate's always on the computer until really late, so I never get to use it anymore. Not til the weekends, like right now.  So that pretty much means I sit in my room and think my insane thoughts and go crazy. Man, the last couple 'o weeks have been frickin' distorted. Seriously. I even scared myself with the writings that have come out of me lately.  Like, my mom actually came out and confronted me with being anorexic...that was some shit. I was going, "No..." But it would be just like me tho, wouldn't it? This is my struggle-free year, but this year I get to set myself up for the fall next year, plummeting into the depths of anorexia and madness. Yeh, let's hope not. A lot. I'm really not too keen on dying at the moment.  O well. I think I had more, but I thought about it too much, and have thusly forgotten it. I've been thinking of doing a gargantuan post all day, but this is the best I could do. Too tired. Too many dreams and "old man moments", where I wake up way early for no reason, and stare at the ceiling and think of random stuff til the alarm goes off.  O well again. Irrelevently yours. (and if you all would like to post about your current stati, feel free, it's not like we really get to much spill it anymore)
