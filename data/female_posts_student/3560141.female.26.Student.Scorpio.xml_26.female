Nothing stupendous or productive happened today, so, I decided as my outing for the evening why not go to the gym and try and shed the few pounds I put on since being forcefed through guilt by my loving aunts.  There it was the usually packed parking lot with an attendant who flags people into obviously empty parking spots and the ones creatively sculpted from the dumpster being moved around by the garbage trucks.  It was empty today, I suppose the rain and lightning makes the treadmill seem like an unlikely choice.  Anyways the usual ritual of searching for the sign up sheet for the treadmill seemed pointless as there appeared to be a total of five people in the gym, so I started stretching and began running...  My routine was coming to an end, the part of the workout where I call myself names and keep picturing life without the extra pounds...when he shows up...that guy, Cud guy, only because he chews his Gatorade gum like a cow.  I had seen him before, he's gotta be like 35, Arab or maybe Indian I don't know, with a heavy mustache, in pretty good shape.  The thing that stands out in his persona is his attitude, he walks with a towel slung over his shoulder, he pushes his way to everything, despite the five people in the gym, and he rarely makes eye contact with anyone.  My first eye witness account of his cocky attitude was when he tapped some old lady on the shoulder and without saying a word, pointed her off the lat machine...dude, pointed her off, like index finger to her and then thumb to the open empty gym floor, the whole time chewing his damn gum like his name was Arthur Bally.  Then he puts the pin in the hole of the lat machine at a level which would have read "I really want my neck veins to rupture, really" or somewhere around 190lbs, either way his gum chewing escalated to beyond cow-like, he got the weight up but believe me I was holding my phone just in case.  This guy had the nerve, anyways I know rules are rules, but I mean with one other person occupying one of the fourteen treadmills I really don't see the need for this invisible confrontation.  He stands at the foot of my treadmill, and I catch his eye in the mirror which faces the machine, he folds his arms, chews so loud I can hear it over the motor, whistles...YES...and then nods...YEAH...I didn't even get the finger..haha...I got nodded off  So, being as he could smoosh me with his calf, I stop running...gather my stuff, and get off...not even a nod to say thanks I guess....
