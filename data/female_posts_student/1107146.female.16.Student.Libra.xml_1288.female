Hey, if anyone is REALLY bored tomorrow, do you want to come to my school's graduation?  It will be SUPER fun.  And, um...I know this is WAY too late to be asking this, but what time do we have to be at choir in the morning?  Yeh, cause I have no idea.    Wow, so I just re-read my entry from last night and it is almost impossible to read.  I'm sorry.  I was a little hyper from about 15 cokes in a 20 minute time period.    I made cookies this evening.  And banana bread.  The cookies are for sunday school/small groups tomorrow and the bread (sorry, no chocolate-chips this time) are for my parents sunday school class.  Yeh, so I have nothing else to write.  Oh yeh, I was making these cookies and my dad came in and was looking for something to eat for dessert.  Well, he wanted a cookie, but I told him no.  So, he goes for the twix bar we have in the pantry.  He starts complaining, so I tell him that he should have the twix ice cream instead.  Well, apparently he can't have that cause it's full fat.  Aren't those two items the same thing pretty much?  I'm confused, cause neither is reduced fat in the first place, yet the ice cream has full fat.  Whatever.
