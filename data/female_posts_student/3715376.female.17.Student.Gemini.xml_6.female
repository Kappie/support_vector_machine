I have like no idea at all what I actually did on the Tuesday after the 3Â½ hour rotary meeting on Monday.... really no idea at all, which is really quite strange.. maybe I rang someone? No, I honestly have no idea... so lets just skip Tuesday and go to Wednesday...     Wednesday - Today I said my goodbye to my little Jill from Oregan, MISS YOU JILL! So got up bright and early at 11am and was at the airport by 12. However, did not come away empty handed - scored 2 bags of her hand-me-down clothes and some old hair products and that kind of stuff. Woohoo! Ok must of it was olf beyond use but it was free, and in an exchange students world, ...well, now ords can quite describe it. Of course it was sad when Jill had to leave, she is so cool and funny and I will miss her heaps but we will get our newbies soon, so that will be fun... that afternoon I went to see My host Mormor and Morfar (granparents on the monthers side) they are really nice, and speak a little bit of english too which is a plus!   Thursday - Ever had just one of those mornings? Ok this was one of those mornings! I had planned to visit the Danish girl who will be my host sister in Australia. The plan was, be in Slangelse by 2, have lunch and dinner there and meet her family. So, it takes around an hour by train to get to Slangelse, wasn't sure how long it would take to organise tickets and what not, so I set my alarm clock for 10, which would give me plenty of time to be there.   So my morning went like this... mum rang and woke me up at 8.15... and as much as i liked talking to her ai was so tired and really wanted to sleep... so i went back to sleep. When I woke up I looked at my watch... and almost had a heart attack! 11:59! Aargh! I had slept until 12! Ok, I did a quick figure of sums in my head... 2 hours... I had one hour traveling time, it would take me half an hour to get to contral station, 5 minutes to bike to the station... so poor me is left with 25 minutes to be up, dressed and showered! So going into superman mode, I sprung into action... Was ready in just under 25 minutes! Wow, new world record! So Jumping on my bike I pedaled as fast as I could to the station... that us, until I got a flat tire... so I ran with my bike as fast as I could the rest of the way (which wasn't too fast considering i had just woken up and i was lugging a bicycle!)I arrived at the station JUST as the train was leaving. This was just too typical! So I waited 20 minutes for the train... which turned into half an hour as the next train was delayed... so after getting off the central station, I rushed into the ticket office, ordered a ticket to Slagelse... and JUST missed my train there! By this stage I was ready to strangle anything and anyone that came near me... but no I fought down my anger and bought a hot dog since I hadn't had time for breakfast. The next train came in half an hour, and in the end I was only half an hour late which really wasn't too bad!   My afternoon - I was a little nervous about meeting Katrine, what if she were big fat and hairy? (sorry personal joke... i really have nothing against big fat hairy people)But no, she was really sweet. We discovered that we both love the same rock music and we both looove horse riding. We got on really well, I can't wait until she lives with me in Australia!   So we went shopping together for gifts for her mum, as it was her mums birthday. Our spoils of war were - some eyeliner, a pair of white pants, a cd and a shaver. We looked around the town of Slagelse for a while and were just on our way back when it started raining. But not just that little harmless rain... this was fig fat heavy drops of rain, and lots of it too! So arm in arm we sprinted to the public library and took shelter in there for a while and we had fun emailing people from her account, and I was going to show her some websited about shepparton but then the rain stopped so we continued on our way back home. We made it home and I met her sister (i had already met her mum at the station) and had dinner of chicken, salad and potatoes, very nice indeed! Then some of her mum's rellies came over so say a quick happy borthday and we ate cake and stuff...mmmm...danish birthday cake.... then Katrine and I sat on the couch together and I showed her some photos of the family in Australia which was nice, she's looking foreward to comming here.   Then we raided her room and figured out what clothes she would need to take to Australia... and with a 20kg limit on luggage we managed to sort out what she would need! Then Nicholas came home, the brasilian exchangeable staying with their family, came hoe from rome and the theree of us just sat around and talked until it was time for this little piggy to catch her train back home...   And it seemed by bad luck with the danish transport system was following me still... half an hour into our journey the train suddenly stopped in the middle of nowhere for like 20 minutes for aparently no reason... but all was well after that and I arrived home safe and happy and very looking much foreward to hosting our little danish student!
