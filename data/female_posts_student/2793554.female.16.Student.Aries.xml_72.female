So old they become stereotypically old people. I should shut up, i dont know what im talking about.  Last night was way boring. Wandered around aimlessly with liz, went to see alex, went to gamelan with helen, dylan, alex,  and uh. A bunch of other people. im too lazy to think. ::dies::  and then we uh. sat there. and everyone left so we walked down pearl and saw devon and hung out with these crazy dirty punks for a little while and then...uh...we went to go see shai and she was WAYYY baked and it was hilarious. But then we went home and fell asleep. But we made a bunch of really good food so it was ok.  i have to go to a graduation party today. Im so sad that jessie is leaving for europe! i mean, i guess its not that sad, shell be gone like, 6 weeks. But still! shes insane and fun.  what do you wear to a graduation party?  ugh. im way too lazy to think of anything else to write.  ~b
