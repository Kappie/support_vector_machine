So, all of you, I suggest you get a Blogger blog! I think it would be a nice way for all of us to keep in contact/up to date with eachother!! So, GET ONE!!! Okay, so yeah.    So if I didn't tell you, my house is officially up for sale. There's even a nice red sign out front. This Saturday we're having an open house and my parents are putting ads in alot of newspapers and stuff. I really hope this house sells and I hope we find a good house in the L'Anse Creuse school district. I was looking @  houses for sale down there on the internet the other day and I showed Tara one. It was a nice house, $400,000 though! Um, so what have you all been up to? I've been babysitting the sibs for the past few days because my parents are carpeting the basement floor, which makes the house value go up.   So, I'm getting ready to go now because I'm tired  bored. But I will leave you all with something funny that happened today. Roberta was brushing her teeth getting ready for work (at Taco Bell), Casandra walked into the bathroom and was like "ROBERTA THAT'S MY TOOTHBRUSH IN YOUR MOUTH!" LOL. Roberta was brushing with Casandra's toothbrush and has been for the past week and a half since we got back from my Grandparent's! My mom put Casandra's toothbrush in the spot Roberta's is normally in (we don't exactly have assigned spots, but Roberta begs to differ!), and Roberta just used the tooth brush even though  Roberta's toothbrush is a different color than Casandra's and their toothbrush caps are different colors too!  I guess that just proves how dumb she is! Later dudes.
