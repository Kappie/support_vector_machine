I'll probably end up leaving around 8:30.  Yup.  I haven't really thought a lot about school yet.  I tried calling Jenna (my roommate) last night but she wasn't there, so I talked to her mom.  That was funny! She has got such a HUGE Minnesotan accent.  It made me smile so much.  Jenna tried calling me back today, but my cell was in my room... Speaking of cell, I got one not long ago.  Call me anytime, but FYI almost all of my minutes are for mobile to mobile or night and weekend.  Yeah.  Anyway, it's my "birthday" tonight so I've gotta go get ready.  I haven't taken time to get ready in a long time! Peace.
