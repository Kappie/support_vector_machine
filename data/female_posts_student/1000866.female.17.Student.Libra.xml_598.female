Ah!  this love has taken it's toll on me...la la la....whoooo  I'm in a pretty decent mood right now actually, especially considering my Sunday so..that's pretty nice.  Today wasn't bad. I spent a lot of my school time finishing up my W.E.W. paper that I really should have finished about two weeks ago. Whoops. Oh well. I didn't want to talk with anyone much today anyway. I forgot my trumpet today though. That was kind of annoying. no good. Ah welllll.   I don't even feel like writing about my day except..i'm pretty sure I aced my math test. Boo yah Grandma. Wow...what a loserish saying and yet...it's great. Sort of...  I'm going to go be abnormal someplace else now where everyone doesn't have to witness it.
