I cant believe it. Seems like I was just freaking out about starting highschool and wondering if anyone would like me. Insane. Im actually not really looking forward to the summer. call me wierd. Getting away from the actual school work will be nice but I don't even know if im going to get to see my friends really. I don't have a job and I don't have any idea where I should apply. So basically its probably gonna be a lonley/boring summer for me. At least I'll get a sexy tan while im doing it. lol. So yeah...... im supposed to be organizing my thoughts. This weekend was pretty boring. I went to danielle's after school on friday and we saw the play yet again. Its really amazing. So that was lot of fun. Then on Saturday I made this game for English. I hope i get a good mark on it. It took waaay to much time. Well I guess that's all i have to say for the moment. Got school tomorrow so i should go get all my crap ready for that. tootles
