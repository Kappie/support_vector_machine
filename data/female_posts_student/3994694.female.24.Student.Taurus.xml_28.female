I'm still interested if people know whether the book is a reflection of Oscar Wilde's life, or whether it's just an idea followed through to its logical conclusion. Any comments from artsy literature types who've studied this kind of thing? Anyone else whose read the book but come to different conclusions from me (see entries below)?  Well, just because I don't really have anything interesting (compared to Dorian Gray) to discuss today, I might as well let everyone know I'm not going back to China this year – the conference got cancelled. This has kind of taken away my motivation to finish my thesis quickly, which may be a problem as I am incredibly skilled in the fine art of procrastination (this may be a psychological feature of people who read and write blogs…). However, it does give me enough time to do a good job rather than rushing it through to the finish.  Word of advice to thesis writers/those considering masters degrees… just because you can write 500-1500 words per day, it doesn’t mean you are writing quality. Actually, even if you are a wonderfully skilled writer, it still doesn’t mean anything if it doesn’t directly relate to your thesis question. You need to be absolutely certain where you are going in terms of future conclusions, and ruthless in selecting only that information that is relevant to where you are going. People who keep presenting conference papers and writing journal articles on their research well after they have finished their masters do not do so because they have some sad beautiful mind inability to let it go, but because you pick up so much extra information and ideas in the field that you aren’t allowed to put in your thesis, and you want to analyse it and get it out somehow.  Actually, my data chapter has just passed 13,000 words. The total length of the thesis is supposed to be less than 40,000 and it consists of seven chapters. I have written three, and already have 30,000 words. Hmmmm. And it’s not even clear what my exact point is. This is a serious problem.  This is also a problem with qualitative research, where everything has to be described in words rather than tables and percentages. It’s about understanding ideas (both complex and contradictory) rather than presenting data exactly. They should allow a bigger word limit for qualitative research.
