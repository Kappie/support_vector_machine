Actually, I talked to Brad during the break... but not only that, he talked to me.. which is even more surprising.  Stuff with him is confusing... we can't be friends without fighting, and there doesn't seem to be a happy medium between friends that can't get along and just never talking.  I thought we had found it a few weeks ago... but then who knows what happened and things went back to zero contact.  So it was kinda nice to talk to him again.  So far that has been the only good conversation of the day (it's only noon but this still says alot).    My mother greeted me when i got home with, "I think someone has stolen the cell phone.... i left it in plain view in my unlocked car on the curb at the seminary."  She asked if she could borrow mine... no way.. she'll lose that one next.  I really don't see how my parents can be so hypocritical.  My father has the nerve to tell all my life, "don't eat or drink next to the computer... you  could  spill it, and it  could  ruin the keyboard, and we  might  have to get another.  Then he goes off and walks into the Gulf of Mexico with a fairly new cell phone in his pocket!!!!  We hadn't even had it a year!  Well now my mother.. who has always said "lock your door lock your door lock your door" and is repeatedly telling me to keep my car locked.... leaves ANOTHER CELL PHONE (this was the replacement from last time... meaning it was only 3 months old) in her unlocked car.  She has power locks... she could be 10 yards away and still lock it.  My parents are rediculous.  Lea is also rediculous... I WANT MY SWEATSHIRT BACK!  it's not like it's my ONLY sweatshirt or anything.. but it's mine and how in the world did it get to Volga????? this is how  that  phone conversation went:  Me: so Lea.. you know that sweatshirt I loaned you when you were visiting.  Do you know what you did with it? Lea: oh yea I have it Me: You do!! good i have been looking for that everywhere.  I've torn the house apart! Lea: Oh yeah i wore it to school yesterday.... why..? do you want it back... Me:hhmm...... well...  YES OF COURSE I WANT IT BACK   okay so i didn't say that but for crying out loud... did she think i gave it to her to have FOREVER??  furthermore... she hasn't and isn't making any effort to give it back to me anytime soon.  She refuses to mail it and says she doesn't know when she can bring it back... but "i want to come to town so maybe when i come and see everyone."  I'm sorry Lea... but i don't care... just give me back my sweatshirt!
