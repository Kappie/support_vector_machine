Word of the Day for Monday August 18, 2003     wunderkind \VOON-duhr-kint\, noun;    plural wunderkinder \-kin-duhr\:    1. A child prodigy.    2. One who achieves great success or acclaim at an early age.       It  was even written that, at 20, his best days were behind      him.  He  had  gone  from  a  wunderkind  to  an  object of      sympathy, a hero struggling not to be forgotten.      --"Owen  shines  like  a  beacon amid the wrecks," [1]Times      (London), May 29, 2000       In  the mid-thirties, he became the youngest and best state      director  of  FDR's  National Youth Administration, a Texas      wunderkind  who  at  age  twenty-eight  beat several better      known  opponents  for  a  south-central Texas congressional      seat.      --Robert Dallek, [2]Flawed Giant      _________________________________________________________     Wunderkind  comes  from  German, from Wunder, "wonder" + Kind,    "child."'    This weekend was fun, I went camping with my family and then to my cousins wedding.  The funniest thing happened. I was sitting playing my guitar and this little girl walks up to me (not my cousin) and starts talking to me. It was completely adorable. She was 4 I think. She asked me how I was playing guitar, and since I was playing above the 12th fret I started to explain to her how the Greeks discovered that if you cut a wavelength in half you end up with the same wavelengh in a different frequency, and how that applied to the strings.    She kept changing the subject. It was annoying, but cute.    Then out the the middle of nowhere she's like. "I killed a hamsta". I was like "what?" and she was like "I picked him up and I threw him, and then I sat on him and he died". It was a gift from God. The whole weekend was better after that, it was so unbelieveable funny. I guess you would have to just have to had to met her or something.
