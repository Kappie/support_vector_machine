I'm sorry I made you cry Bethy I didn't mean that and you know I love you (platonically, of course).    Anyway...  Thursday dad had to work and didn't get back till almost 9, so I didn't really do much.  I didn't feel like going to the pool alone and being attacked by the people down there... God, I hate feeling like the minority.  This sucks...  Then I texted with Sam and Derek for awhile.  That was cool, b/c I haven't really talked to Derek in a loooong time, and I haven't talked to Sam since he left for Fla.  Lainie didn't respond to my texts, and Heathy couldn't text me back until she got off work.  Then my dad got home and we ate dinner, then I called Sam and talked to him for about 15 mins (I was only supposed to be on for about 10, but oh well).  Then after midnight Ken finally texted me back telling me he'd read the letter.  I was SOOOOOOOOOO freaking happy, and that lifted a lot of the tension off.  Part of me was afraid that I'd screwed too much stuff up and that he wouldn't want to try to make everythig work out and start over.  I know that I screwed up really bad and hurt him a lot, and I know that I don't deserve to have him back, so I considerr myself extremely lucky to be in love w/ someone who loves me back as much as he does.  Yesterday we went with dad while he did some of his work.  They were stores on the east coast, and we were going to go to the beach while we were in Melbourne,  but it was raining all day,  so that didn't really happen...   We ate lunch at Friendly's.  I've never eaten at one of those before...  it was pretty good though.  I had chicken strips, and I can't figure out what my obcession has been w/ chicken strips lately... Oh well, they're good, so I'm just going to keep eating them.  We didn't really do much else yesterday.  I was finally able to get postcards, and I'm going to send them out today, so you'll get them after I get home, but oh well.  Mande, Lainie, Bethy, and Sam, you'll get yours in the mail.  Heathy, Ken, and Robert... I'll just bring yours.   I wanted to buy everyone little souvenirs, but I only brought $20 with me, which isn't enough to buy much of anything in this place...  But anyway... today we're probably going back to Universal Studios and/or Islands of Adventure for awhile.  I'm going to talk my father into buying me this really cool necklace I saw, and maybe talk him into giving me money to buy stuff for everyone, but I don't know how well that will turn out.  We're eating lunch at Emeril's restaurant, b/c my sister is a big Emeril fan...  I don't get to go to Epcot, but oh well I guess...  Tomorrow we're probably doing the same general thing as we do today.  Our flight doesn't leave until 6:15, and we have to check out of the condo by 10am, so we have most of the day.  Then we get home around 8:15 WI time...  Hopefully mom is on time picking us up, and I can be at my house by 9:30, no later than 10. *crosses fingers*  She'll probably forget about us, but oh well...  But yeah, it's only 9am and I'm already up, showered, dressed, and ready to go, except for putting in my contacts.  Kait's fast asleep and dad's supposed to be back by about 10am (he had two stores he had to work at today).  Then we can leave...  So I guess I'll go try to wake her up and get her going so we can leave shorty after dad gets back.  I'll see/talk to everyone on Monday!!!
