Before graduating, everyone was like 'please take care' and 'do remember me', 'meet whenever possible, k?' But now? We will still tell each other to take care, but meeting each other seemed impossible... Why is this so? Are we really that busy that we couldn't meet, sit down and chat? Why is it always a 'hi' and 'bye' conversations between us...?  I miss my choir pals too... We were so bonded together during that SYF period, and now, it's like everyone is busy with thier own stuff... leaving only ZZ in choir now... Our instructor left... Haiz~ A year had passed after SYF 2003... Sad~ I wonder how my juniors are doing now... Know that they will be performing for the National Day Parade 2004... Getting excited to see them on TV... Haiz~ What extremely mixed feelings I have now! That's all
