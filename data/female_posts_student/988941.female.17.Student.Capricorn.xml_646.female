He then turned into James Bond and bounced around the centre swatting flies and scaring children. I came across a fake pound coin today! Never seen one before, and the customer hadn't either, he was quite suprised! Other than Garf and Biscuit's attempt at wearing womens jackets and Alex wearing winter-wet-suits it was a pretty normal day, or as normal as it can get.
