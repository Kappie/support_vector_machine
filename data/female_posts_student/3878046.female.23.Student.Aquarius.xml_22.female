	 
      i go down there in the morning sun,
to meet my friends and have some fun.
we take a dip in the rising waves
and look for birds' eggs in the darkened caves.
as the sun gets higher
the sand turns to gold
and we look ihn the shops 
at the things that are sold.
when the sky gets dark
we all go home
and wait for tomorrow
when again we'll roame.
