The bipartisan commission, they stressed, determined "that the 'disenfranchisement of Florida's voters fell most harshly on the shoulders of black voters' and in poor counties." Both groups vote predominantly Democratic in US elections.   The commission also concluded, the lawmakers added, that "despite promised nationwide reforms (of the voting system) ... adequate steps have not been taken to ensure that a similar situation will not arise in 2004 that arose in 2000."   Even if all of these things are true, the presence of the U.N. is hardly likely to help matters.  They're only likely to amke it worse by setting up some kind of directive or standard or demand and then not following up upon it, not enforcing it, and decrying others who try to see that the aims are met.    This is what they did in Iraq, after all, is it not?
