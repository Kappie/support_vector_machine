Hiding behind someone's back is so pathetic.  I went to the library yesterday and borrowed some books and cds and one dvd (The Others). I was so happy to be in a library again, although the library here in Wettingen is very small. I love the atmosphere and the heaps of books. I also managed to find 'The God of Small Things' from Arundhati Roy. I read it when I was in Germany and was completely fascinated by the story, the book's world and atmosphere... Unfortunately it wasn't my own book, I had borrowed it from my friend Radek and I had to give it back to him. Now I borrowed it once again and I think I'll end up buying it. The language in the book is so poetic and mystical that it leaves a lot of responsibility for the reader in making interpretations. One of my favorite passages is this:  As she leaned against the door in the darkness, she felt her dream, her afternoon-mare move inside her like a rib of water rising from the ocean, gathering into a wave. The cheerful one-armed man with salty skin and a shoulder that ended abruptly like a cliff emerged from the shadows of the jagged beach and walked towards her.                   Who was he?                   Who could he have been?                   The God of Loss                   The God of Small Things                   The God of Goose Pumps and Sudden Smiles.                   He could do only one thing at a time.                    If he touched her, he couldn't talk to her, if he loved her he couldn't leave, if he spoke he couldn't listen, if he fought he couldn't win.                   Ammu longed for him. Ached for him with the whole of her biology.                   She returned to the dinner table. (p. 330)  Then I borrowed a book called 'How to Read a Film'. It gives the basics in understanding films more deeply with the help of different theories etc. It's in German, but it's alright. If my German is already so good that I can study in German, I can surely read that book, too.  1:36 pm  np: Kula Shaker - Knight on the Town  I borrowed 'Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie' from Alanis Morissette and couldn't listen to it. It was so full of shit. Wannabe-artistic whining. Mrs. Morissette seems to want to be a fucking emancipated cow, who shouts "fuck all men, nobody's worth me!" on the barricades of feminism... Words are not enough to describe the horror of that album. So, Kula Shaker instead. This is ok, but not really my thing, either. Psychedelic sounds and party feeling. Ok, nice and so on, but nothing worth listening with concentration.  4:27 pm  Hui. Went shopping with Rico's mum and came home a while ago. Now I'm gonna go cooking and baking and stuff. Honey's coming home soon.
