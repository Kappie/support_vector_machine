Well, I am sitting here, looking at my fridge, wondering what to blog about. There is nothing running through my brain except for all the screwed up codes, and my eye is starting to tweak.  Well, anyways, I was sitting quite happily, doing particularly nothing, when all of a sudden, from the back of my mind, a giant unpleasant thought errupted. Dear God school starts next week! Prepare for a slow and painful death. Anyways, I have run out of thought. I seem to be trapped in some sort of zombie-like twilight zone. So I'll post later.  -Shannon
