Where the future beckons to me and I am officially no longer a student by July. I can't skip my lectures, not do my tutorials and sleep in class anymore..The lives of upmteen peeps lie in my frail arms and shoulders after I grad. *GuRps*  I can tell you, I have forgotten 101% of what I have learnt in Nus. I can't even bring myself to counsel any patients man. Erm, simply cos I do not attend much of my counsellng sessions. Seriously, this speak volumes of how enthusiastic I am in this course. This year deems the year where I have officially become an adult, where I will be starting to work to fend for myself and pay bills, step into the sadistic world where Satan is gaining hold of. Of unlimited bills, pending interests, unsured occupations and bills bills and more bills. The live of a Singapore infant dies the moment he/she is deemed SINGAPOREAN. It's like securing an invisible chain to your ankles the moment u are born and that U have to slog from the day u were born to death just to pay bills, loans, grants and whatever shit. Unless u are bloodily rich which will be the last thing that will ever happen to me. We are creating a vicous cycle of chaining if we continue to be the way it is man. I love studying.. but I must admit I love playing more than studying so which ends up I hate studying cos I will be cramming 4 months of shit work in 2 miserable weeks for a idiosyncratic 2 hour exam which determines whether u can get the butt out of ther fucked up system in Sg. Life is full if irony. When do u really want to be rational? when do u want to be emotional? The rules are just intangible. If life had been just a simple decision where u can be rational and irrational as and when u want, it won't be the fucked up world we are living now.   Persismistic isn't it? I only seek solance from God. For only He makes things perfect out of inperfection.   Sighz.. latersz
