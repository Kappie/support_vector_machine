I think I'm going to have my brother fix it when he comes by this weekend. I get to see Maureen too!! She's so awesome and nice and...yeah...I like my brother's girlfriend more than him. Haha, not really but I like her a lot. She's fun to be around.   So, yeah, today was good. I was so so sooo happy it was Friday. I need the weekend. But anyway, I took my french quiz this morning. Really easy. YaY! I think I aced it.   Wind Ensemble was ok. Nothing too exciting happened. Mr. Silder's fiancee came. She's really nice. I mean, I guess I couldn't really expect less considering how nice Mr. Silder is. Math was good. I actually get what we're doing. We had a little mini quiz though. That kind of sucked. I didn't know what I was doing on part of it but I think it will be ok.   Gym was fun...as always. Bowling was cool. I actually didn't do as poorly as the other day. I got in the 80's...WOOOO. Haha. Wow, I suck. In the second game, I was winning. WINNING! The first and...only time that will ever happen against Peter and Brandon. Oh, oh! I got a strike today too! That was pretty neat. And at least one spare so...yeah. YaY for me. I'm going bowling again tonight with them. It shall be interesting. Maybe they can teach me how to bowl correctly. HA.   French...good...boring, the usual. Lunch was kind of dull. I had to retype my whole paper because of the stupid virus and...GRRRRRRRRRRR. I'm not going to start on the virus again but seriously...I'm about ready to castrate my computer. Yeah, anyway, 6th hour was good. Just did some homework. The stalker is sort of back though...that's no fun. He's really getting on my nerves.   History...hmmm...we watched possibly the scariest/weirdest/dumbest video I've ever seen. I just thought it was really really stupid. I felt like I could be doing better things with that time. It's like the Spice Girls movie. OK, THAT was the scariest/weirdest/dumbest movie I've ever seen. Haha...this is definitely reminding me of Lauren's and my conversation last night. Albino Spice...Slutty Spice...wooo.   And then, Satire and Comedy was ok. We talked about the Shawshank redemption. What an amazing movie. If you haven't seen it RENT IT! It's awesomely awesome.   And so yeah....that was just another exciting day at school. And by exciting...I mean...hmmm, I'm trying to think of a good adjective. There's so many. Oh well, Here...I'll make it a fill in the blank kind of thing. You can put whatever adjective you want in there. And by exciting, I mean _______. Wow, that was fun.  Emily drove me home today too, which was nice. I got to talk to her. She's really really cool. I don't get to talk to her all that often and she's a really easy person to talk to, so it was fun.   Ah, I guess I'll go off and...ha, do nothing. No homework for me. :) And the little bit I have, I don't have to do because of Evening With Humanities rehearsal 1st through 6th hour on Monday. Ohh yeah! I'm just sad I'll miss bowling.   I'm out like that poor fat kid in dodgeball. Actually...I'll make it so no one can yell at me for making fun of fat people. I'm out like the blind kid in dodgeball. Yeah....now no one can tell me I'm making fun of anyone but myself. :)
