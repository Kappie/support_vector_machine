Why is it then that humans who seem to have much more control over things then the average house pet still get overwhelmingly sad sometimes?  Is it a moment in time?  An actual event perhaps...  But sometimes we just get sad for no perticular reason.  Or maybe humans in general don't get this way and its just me?  I don't know really.  I probably should being that at one time I was a psych major.  For me, today is one of those days.  I just finished watching a really heart warming movie "love actually" (everyone must see this movie) which should have left me feeling good in the end, a sort of boy meets girl, boy gets girl type of film, that left me instead feeling empty.  That's life I guess...  Terrible metaphor, but so true in some cases.   Saw Barlow last night, and "ran" into Damien, he's just such a charmer, I guess its the rock star allure.  I wonder if when you sign a record deal or maybe its even before that (during music lessons), I wonder if they pull you aside and make you attend a rock star charm school?  Is that possible?  Or is it the opposite you are charming to begin with therefor capable as a rock star.  Regardless, there's just something about them all.  I woke up with a terrible hangover and a smile and now I sleep tonight sad.  I guess you could say love is like cocaine (not at all that I even remotley love Damien) maybe better say; human emotion is like a roller coaster of cocaine.  In that, the high is so perfectly wonderfull in the begining that you never want it to end, but it has to and then its so sad afterwards... Well this is all a bunch of b.s. and honestly a bit theraputic ok a lot theraputic, I'll be in a better mood tomorrow...  Keep on Trucken...
