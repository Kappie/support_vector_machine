To paraphrase Erica, when there are so many different things and they all disagree with each other none of them can be true.  Even as I write this I don't entirely believe it, but thats the entire problem.  On some gut level I sense things yet my mind then recognizes some of them and dissmisses others.  There is no way that I am everything I seem to be,  the person I am at school in class, the person I am in Shul, the person I am when we are out somewhere like armadillo.  It just doesn't work.  Nor can I eliminate the acting from the truth.  So many faces, so many choices, why do I pick the ones I do?
