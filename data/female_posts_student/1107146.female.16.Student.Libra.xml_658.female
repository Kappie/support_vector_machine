I got pissed off so I wrote this song There's no new words so sing along Can you say "fuck"? Can you scream real loud? Cuz if you can do that, then you know just how Grandma's in the kitchen makin' s'ghetti and meatballs A little Taiwanese kid just learned how to fly And everybody's story is a story to beat all So here comes the chorus, and you can't beat mine  Half-past the cynical, borderline sarcastic Welcome to the chorus where it all comes back Maybe feign political, really self-slapstick This doesn't make sense, but you already knew that  So here goes the part where I first say "fuck" But if you've already heard us, then fuck stuff I don't have another Top 40 coming up any time And it's by the grace of God that I can even still rhyme Every motherfucker hearing "fuck", and going crazy I bet you'd fucking like it if I yelled some fucking more This might be the fucking greatest you've heard maybe But all I fuckin' know's, it's making my throat sore   Chorus   The End! And another. Ok, so the song is called  Braincells (I Wanna Sniff Glue) , but it isn't about sniffing glue...even tho it actually comes out and says that. It's more about wanting to be killed and stay a kid than to grow up and be everyone's bitch, and glue is the proposed remedy.   When last I checked, "fuck" was used very interestingly in this song, and without frugality. It's another pop-punk song, hence the excessive use of "fuck" and other four-letters. So lessgo!! w00tw00t!!!111oneone   Braincells (I Wanna Sniff Glue)  by Stranglebox  You tell me I am gonna be A really big star if I can be A superman, everything and more Than I am All society has pressured me To go and take a stand Where I cannot I make a lot of mistakes And more than half the time I'm on a repeat anyways I'm not gonna learn a stupid motherfucking thing So would you please shut the fuck up And go the fuck away  You have told me a thousand times But I never really seem to change I haven't got a reason or rhyme Cuz all I fucking feel is shame So let's cut the bullshit and get to the heart And that way we can find a real place to start Yeah, I don't really know about a thing you do Cuz all's I really fuckin' know is: I wanna sniff glue (Hooah!!)  You talk about how great I am When I'm watching it So would you understand when I Say that I can't take anymore The teams ain't fucking fair And I'm the one with the losing score Gonna kill me a bunch 'o braincells Cuz all the bullshit that was simple's On a downslide to hell It's ok if I am only talking about  Fucking up, but when I do it Then it's time to throw me out   Chorus  Lude  Chorus  Yeah, I don't really know But hell if anybody knew Cuz all I really fuckin' know is: I wanna sniff glue (YEEAAAAH!!!)  That stuff after the chorus in parenthesis is really in the song, it's a great one!!! This is the ultimate "Fuck conformity!!!" Anthem right here.   Hmm...looking thru Ye Olde Booke Ofe Notese, I want to post a more serious one. I've written a thousand since I started in on the demos. With such titles as  Norm Bakerton the Monkey Shit Shoveller ,  Cacophony ,  Churn ,  Grave  (which is actually going on the demo once we get it all down pat.....IF we do), and... Slump . I might as well.  It might take some thinking to figure out the last line of the chorus...sort of open to interpretation, but I'm sure you all could get something out of it.   Slump  by Stranglebox  I woke up early Saturday morning smelled like rain and Feeling blown and surly I thought tomorrow would hurt like hell I hope that I'm not right.....as I open my eyes  I took my time I drank a Coke and swallowed memories I lost the rhyme The reason soon thereafter followed I sink into a wall.....you're up, but nature says you fall  Oh, it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the time, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use some new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all  I waited outside Cold as hell the street was frozen I smiled as it shined And knew how quick it'd kill me If I gave it one quick try.....cuz it only lives to die  The drive was cold, it was 6 PM, December 21 And ten more days, I know Will be a new year, this has been The worst one of my life.....it sucks, but it burns to go outside  Oh, it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the time, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use a new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all  (little 'lude)  Oh it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the tiem, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use a new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all (repeat)  I've become a really odd songwriter lately. I don't write in any given time period (granted,  Slump ), I just write a whole lot of really really bipolar stuff. Sigh...sometimes it sucks to be on the craaazy side of the lefty fence.  And by the way...Jsoh? Can that even be pronounced?
