I went to Kuanthan, Malaysia this weekend and many things that I saw there got me thinking. You can say that Kuanthan is about approximately the Bukit Timah area here in Singapore. A pretty small town near the seaside area that has seen many recent developments in terms of technological advancements.    From my 9th story hotel room window I could see the entire skyline- awesome. Thats something you will never get to see in singapore. Too many tall skyscrapers to block the view hahaha.  The pace of life there seems much more relaxed too. You hardly see people rushing from one place to another and everyone always seems to have the time to just sit back and relax. No one seems to be in a hurry.   But have to add that its not all that great there either! haha In my opinion, Singapore is a much better place to live! :) I'm always a patriotic Singaporean- ALWAYS!   Most shops close at around 10 there. Pretty much a dead town after that- just loads of cars but no people. People there don't seem to think that walking is a way of getting from one place to another. You almost never see people walking around (that some what explains why there don't seem to be any pavements there). People around there didn't seem to know their town that well either so most of the time we kept driving in circles haha.  oh ya one more thing- you GOT to know malay or you are equivalent to an alien hahah (good for us my Dad knows a little Malay)
