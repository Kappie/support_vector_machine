If combined, what will we be?  Will the people ever see  That there is more to me than they concieve?  If dropped, do we not all brake? If pushed too far, do we not all shake? If we want, do we not all take?  I fail to see the difference, I fail to change the ways.  We are similar to glass. Tough, yet easily damaged. Strong, yet so very weak.
