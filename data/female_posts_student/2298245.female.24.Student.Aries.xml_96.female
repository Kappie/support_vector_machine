He does a good job in pointing out the flaws in the argument, especially noting that this is standard practice, and that sitting Presidents usually do not attend such events, that it has even been their policy since the first Bush administration specifically to not do so.  There are plenty of things that President Bush can be criticized for, so it doesn't really behoove anyone to waste their time on the silly or misguided ones.  And these same people would be criticizing him for attending funerals, if he so chose, saying that he was only doing so in a vain and self-righteous attempt to score political points.
