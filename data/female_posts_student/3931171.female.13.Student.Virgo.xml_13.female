Ask any swimmer, most of them hate it, but they couldnt imagine their life with out it. Its part of them, its something they live for. They live for the 5 a.m practices, pasta partys, cheers, long bus rides, invitationals, countless swim caps, chlorine, and coaches you hate but appreciate later. They live for the way it feels when you beat the person next to you by a tenth of a second and you know those 2 extra laps you did in practice were worth it. You live for the way you jump every time you hear a buzzer, or the way you scream whenever you hear the gun on the 500 even though you hear it every time. You live for the way you celebrate when you get to do a set with fins. You live for the way you become a family with your team, and noone understands what happens within that pool or locker room but you. You live for the countless songs you sing in your head when your swimming those laps. You live for the people who scream at you while your swimming even though all you hear is BLAH BLAH BLAH. You live for the competition, you live for the friends, you live for the practice, you live for the pain, its a part of you.
