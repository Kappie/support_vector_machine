As nice as it would be to get outta school tomorrow and all...usually whenever everyone starts getting all giddy about snow...  ...it never snows.  Which is why I'm gonna be all "don't know, don't care" about the snow.  Moving on...  The "ernie" thingy...(if it's still on that sesame street character) on the right is a "terror alert" thing. I thought it was sort of funny.  Terrorism isn't funny. At all...but seeing ernie over there makes the orange level not so threatening.  Don't worry, be happy.  I'm either gonna try to go get some sleep or go watch some tv.  Until next time...
