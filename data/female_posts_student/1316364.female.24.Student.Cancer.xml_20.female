All of the I love you’s, I’m sorry’s and such. All of these memories that have been touched, By your sweet soft lips, Your caressing hands,  and those looks I can’t resist.  But still I wait in wonder, All of those days you will be missed, Our solemn good byes and For the chance of that one special kiss.  I wait for those words, To be spoken from your lips, Don’t worry my dear, My time away will be quick, Before your heart will even began to break, I will be home once again with you.   yet I wait in wonder.
