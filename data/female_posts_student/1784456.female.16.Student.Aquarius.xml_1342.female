Sad, yup. I was thinking about that... seriously shouldn't be musing about that on this now should I? But it's good to think... in your head at least. Some people don't like to hear thoughts, but it's good to share them. What would happen if we didn't? Hitler? Hmm... see what happens when I think? Well... eugh, let's talk about test. (Fun...) Yeesh, can't believe I'm doing the mocks of the mocks! What's up with this world? (Under pressure... dum de di dum dum) Umm... yeah... guess I've have gone a bit crazy under the pressure. I'm also a bit annoyed that they didn't put cool stuff on the tv! It's all been crap! (During the day I mean, normal school hours) The tests were stupid though, every one finishes about half an hour early, but they can't let us go! Eugh, I've had enough, any way I've only got three left - Biology, Maths and Music! (Aaargh! Music's too hard!) *pull yourself together!* Really need to get out more!
