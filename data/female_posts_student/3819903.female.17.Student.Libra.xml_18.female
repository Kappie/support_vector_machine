I'm in the Dorm I wanted:  Stevie, Room 103, 2 other roommates: Jessica and Melissa.  Ahh.. Shall be fun!    So did little in the 6 hours before heading over to Matt Pollack's House around 8:30. Wow...Poker night went...umm...Well?! Lets See...Nicole, Joe Jr., Sam, Angela, Justin, Matt and Myself, played some poka', until about 12:45. The elimination process went as follows: Sam, Angela, Nicole, Justin, Matt...ooh and your wondering why I'm not in those first four!?...Joe and I battled it out for about a half hour! I clearly had more chips from the get-go, so after i try to get the pot bigger...joe would fold. So this half hour consisted of fold after fold, or me winning every hand! Oh well...I prolly got lucky a couple times, due to trip 7's, two times in a row!!?? I dunno, i thought that was pretty lucky! Ahh...it feels good to win! I took all 400 chips! Wow! During this ordeal...Joe-who's allergic to cats- went home to get some benadryl...the drowsy kind! So...in order to keep Joe awake...we gave him some strong caffeinated drink name Mountain Dew..i dont know, i've never heard of it?! And...this apparently strong elixer, barely kept him awake. He played with his chips alot-to the point where it was annoying, but i didnt say anything cause he was half asleep-and gave away his chips alot too! I was seriously surprised that he was my opponent in the end, he should have been out cold 20 minutes after he took his "drugs?!"    Overall, the day was pretty good, uneventful, but pretty good in a sense that I WON! hahahaha (evil laugh)    Goodnight All!
