I woke up fairly early again today, and the cold wet air from the window sunk down over my shoulders.    I learned a story this week.  It has many parts that are all interwoven, and it becomes hard to distinguish this waking dream from a sleeping one.  It came while I was lost in thought and sinking in and out of knowledge of my bodies motions.  There are two roles in this world- there is the hunter and the prey.  In this world all things live in a strange fluid always in these roles.  We are both hunter, and prey, and we move between them like they are part of us- they are- we are born of this place.  When we enter into one role for any extended amount of time, it is a space that we feel powerful in.  We are able to hold an identity up, we are able to know ourselves for what we have momentarily become.    The hunter- the hunter is compassion in us, the forgiving, the death bringer, the complete moment of fire and anger.  The hunter consumes to forgive, they take to be alive.  Hunters eyes flash as they stalk, they are alive with the knowledge of what their loving will bring.  When they eat flesh, the moments of battle and weariness that haunt are taken away.  They watch as they are pleaded with by their prey to give them the everything of nothing.  They are merciless in their quest to give the gift of destruction.  It is beautiful and true.  It is pure.  It is.  The Prey- are waiting to give of themselves, are waiting to be exposed, are waiting to show their souls at the moment before they are eaten to eternity.  The prey are listening to the seconds before they cease to exist and learn all things- they are aware.  They are begging, pleading with passionate voices so deftly erotic, so blissfully tainted, that their knowledge come quickly.  They are forcing the hunter to promise- promise, hunter, that if I fight, if I give you my last bit of strength, that you will win.  They are supplicating themselves to the destruction of everything- they are waiting for the ultimate compassion- layed bare- layed true.  To be consumed completely- is there any other peace so profound?  To give the gift of that annihilation, is there anything more generous?    And we play both parts.  In the interaction of a word, in the gesture of a hand, in the movement of our bodies, our inner thoughts and actions, we are schizophrenically vacillating between these two noble and terrible truths.  There is exposure in both- there is open giving in both.  We move a million times an hour between these two selves and rarely see.  We recognize the distinct but similar blood pulsing in our ears when we slip into one though.  We can feel the tremor in our hearts when we move into one space or another, and we begin to slip out of language.  Why are love and hate the culmination of humanness?  Is it possibly because in those two things we find our roles defined?  When we hunt the lover, seek out to give of ourselves in a union that will destroy us?  When we give our selves over to the hunter of our anger- when becoming completely that which is destruction- allow our hearts to move without our consent, do we not become more?  When we stopped knowing the tearing of wet flesh from bone, when we stopped knowing the truth of being eaten, then we needed language to define us.  Before that there just was, a cycle that was unnamed, and it was the utter truth of the world.    In my waking dream I saw the dance of human nature.  I saw the slight turn of seven veils that shows that we are not always what we seem.  The lover pleading for an end to their lust can be the hunter, and the suitor can be the one waiting to be eaten.  I saw in my dream the openness of being exposed- naked to another human- exposed with nothing but your shell protecting you from everything- and that shell is cracking- and there is faith there- because there is nothing else to have.    There are other ways, but they are hard to find, and a deeper piece is needed to stop play acting beast and beauty for a while.  If you have not felt the sensual insistent need of these, or if you have not recognized what they are- you are not trying hard enough.  Black and white are idle metaphors, but this split is a dire adoration creating the moments of power in the cycle...
