I don't think you could ever possibly imagine how many there are these days.  It amazes me how some people can be so damned weird to people they just met.  I suppose that it has something to do with the lack of personal, face to face, conversation.  Almost anyone could be on the other side of that computer and Internet weirdoes don’t give a damn.    Take for example my mom was talking to a guy who was getting married and wanted sex advice for his wedding night, and another guy who told her he was into all sorts of weird things.  These were guys she just stumbled upon while playing on Y! games, and started talking to her.  I told her if she was uncomfortable about being hit on by the weird guys on Yahoo that she should only play with other women, you cannot imagine what she said next, “They’re all lesbians, YUCK!”    So I have to say that I met my husband on the Internet and I WOULD NOT recommend this to anyone.  Now don’t get me wrong, It turned out great and he is a great guy.  Still I must have been out of my mind to meet a guy I met on the Internet!  I realize now that he could have been an ax murderer for all I knew.    My sister met her man on the Internet and when I look at them I realize that I could have gotten a super strange JACKASS like the guy she got, and I cringe!  Her husband is a controlling, drama-queen of a man who will never amount to anything but upstate New York trailer trash.  He and I DO NOT get along and I never intend for that to get any better.  He is an Internet weirdo and she doesn’t even realize it.    So in the end, it all amounts to what the person on the other end of the line is willing to put up with.  Remember all you have to do is “sign-off.”  ~Kristyn
